00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:40,444
"But if you do
wrong, be afraid,

4
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:44,178
for he does not bear the sword
in vain.

5
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,978
He is the servant of God,

6
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:52,410
an avenger who carries out
God's wrath

7
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:54,911
on the wrongful."

8
00:00:57,311 --> 00:01:00,178
I often thought of my friend,

9
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:04,111
Officer Reginald Dean Davis,

10
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,944
when I would read Romans 13:4.

11
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:11,410
That he punished two of the
three men who attacked him

12
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:14,577
before he himself was killed

13
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:18,477
means I will never think of
anyone else ever again

14
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:23,978
when I read or speak this verse.

15
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,844
He died protecting his family,

16
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:32,078
his friends and this city.

17
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:36,878
He was a servant of God.

18
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:42,844
I assuage my rage
that a third man escaped

19
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:46,011
by trying to remind myself
of a few things.

20
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:49,711
First,

21
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,878
Reginald found a woman

22
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:56,878
as strong, driven
and smart as he.

23
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:01,677
And then I think of his boy,

24
00:02:03,278 --> 00:02:04,777
Andre,

25
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:10,611
and I see the same,
sometimes infuriating,

26
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:12,878
fearlessness,

27
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:14,777
inquisitiveness.

28
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:23,044
I know it may not
feel like it now,

29
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:29,444
but you got more from your
father, Andre, in 13 years

30
00:02:29,577 --> 00:02:32,078
than most men will
in a lifetime.

31
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:35,144
He taught you to follow
your conscience,

32
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:39,544
to not take anyone else's word
about what is right and wrong,

33
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:43,911
to find a just code

34
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:47,544
in an often cruel world.

35
00:02:57,245 --> 00:03:00,711
Thank you for making time
for IA at the end of your shift.

36
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:02,477
I didn't have a choice.

37
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:05,611
You could choose
not to be a cop.

38
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,944
Being a cop
isn't a choice for me.

39
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,711
What is it, then?

40
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:12,211
DNA.

41
00:03:12,345 --> 00:03:13,811
At this point,
we don't need to spell out

42
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:14,878
why we're all here.

43
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,111
Yes, we do. Official procedure.

44
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,078
Any officer who discharges his
or her weapon in the line of duty

45
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,178
must justify
every round of ammunition.

46
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,510
You've shot
eight people in nine years.

47
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:28,111
Good shootings. Cleared on all.

48
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,044
Three since you
were made detective.

49
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,577
Four now.

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,477
The one who survived
was sentenced to life without.

51
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:36,711
Do you regret any?

52
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:39,144
I've been to the psychologist.

53
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:40,278
That's not an answer.

54
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,011
No, I do not regret any.

55
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:44,677
Faces don't come to you
in your sleep?

56
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:48,111
Justice comes at a cost.

57
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:50,211
Justice is not determined
by you.

58
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:52,611
But I am the sharp end
of that determination.

59
00:03:52,744 --> 00:03:53,711
Says who?

60
00:03:53,844 --> 00:03:55,178
My badge.

61
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:56,777
My oath.

62
00:03:56,911 --> 00:03:58,245
Your DNA?

63
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,444
During the Civil War,

64
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:13,878
some soldiers just kept loading
their muskets without ever firing.

65
00:04:14,444 --> 00:04:17,377
Five or six balls
loaded on top of each other.

66
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,345
In Vietnam, only 30% of frontline
infantry soldiers ever fired a shot.

67
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:25,245
So, ten soldiers in battle,
only three truly fighting.

68
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:28,311
Are you really using war analogies
here, Detective Davis?

69
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,510
What do you imagine
the other seven were doing?

70
00:04:57,878 --> 00:04:58,844
Hi, Andre.

71
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:00,345
How's she doing?

72
00:05:00,477 --> 00:05:03,477
Tired, but I just
gave her her meds.

73
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:05,711
All right, you can head home.
I got this.

74
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:07,245
Okay.

75
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,178
You know where to find me
if you need me.

76
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,345
What are we watching?

77
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:21,544
You left me.

78
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,078
No, Ma. I had to pull a triple.

79
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:30,245
I've been here too long.

80
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:31,345
I've...

81
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:33,377
I've overstayed my welcome.

82
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,944
Nah. You can never overstay
your welcome.

83
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,811
You're here to take me home.

84
00:05:42,144 --> 00:05:43,644
This is home.

85
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,211
Don't leave me here, Reginald.

86
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:47,844
Ma...

87
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:52,078
it's Andre.

88
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:56,377
It's Dre, Mama.

89
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:01,111
I need to take my meds.

90
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:03,078
No, no, no. You took them.

91
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:04,844
You already took them.

92
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,577
You look tired.

93
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,377
You work too hard.

94
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,544
Yeah, you got that right.

95
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:17,878
It's the job.

96
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,744
It's what I do.

97
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,377
I know.

98
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:24,611
You gotta look the devil
in the eye.

99
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:32,245
Yeah.

100
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,844
Yeah, Ma.

101
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,178
Well, it looks just like
you said it would.

102
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:39,911
Hey, does yours smell
like your beard?

103
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:43,111
It smells like your girl.

104
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,211
Let's go.

105
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,144
Who the fuck are you guys?

106
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:42,011
We're the guys
that are taking your cocaine.

107
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:45,111
Not smart. You guys
are gonna fucking die.

108
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:54,410
Where is it?

109
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,744
Freezer. Downstairs.

110
00:09:58,878 --> 00:10:00,245
We need a key?

111
00:10:16,178 --> 00:10:17,711
Just two of you?

112
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:24,744
You're gonna be here all night.

113
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:29,577
Yo!

114
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:35,878
Move!

115
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,911
That's not 30 keys.

116
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,377
It's 300.

117
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:50,510
Somebody fucked up.

118
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,345
Shut up. On your knees.

119
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,677
Jeez.

120
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,577
This stuff hasn't been cut yet.

121
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,278
Jackpot! Fuck yeah!

122
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,544
No way. We walk.

123
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:14,544
- What?
- We walk.

124
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,510
Small ain't always smart.

125
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:23,410
You can help or you can watch.

126
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,544
This is fucking stupid.

127
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,211
This is fucking freedom.

128
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,677
Shit.

129
00:11:58,311 --> 00:12:00,044
Shh.

130
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,377
The fuck is this guy at?

131
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:04,711
He might be by the back door.
Check it out.

132
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:30,811
<i>Car
back here is still running.</i>

133
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:31,978
<i>Back gate open.</i>

134
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,410
<i>Possible 30 in progress.</i>

135
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,245
Shit. All right.
We're coming in.

136
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:36,510
Stay back.

137
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,377
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Officer down!

138
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,544
Shots fired! Shots fired!

139
00:13:12,677 --> 00:13:14,078
Officer down!

140
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:21,544
Cop! Run!

141
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:23,044
We don't want any more blood!

142
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:28,510
You don't have to kill him.

143
00:13:29,844 --> 00:13:31,211
More are coming.

144
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:57,477
Drive.

145
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:24,944
Cover me.

146
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:00,744
Move the car.

147
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:11,178
<i>8-5 Adam.</i>

148
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,211
<i>8-5 Charlie.</i>

149
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:16,844
<i>8-5 Charlie, on the air?</i>

150
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:23,078
<i>8-5 Frank?</i>

151
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,011
<i>Any units at Mosto's,
please advise.</i>

152
00:15:41,978 --> 00:15:43,577
Don't drive like an asshole.

153
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,544
Stop for this light.

154
00:15:48,178 --> 00:15:50,611
- What the fuck are you doing? I said stop.
- We just fucking killed cops.

155
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:51,811
Fuck!

156
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,245
<i>Central,
we got multiple officers down!</i>

157
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,777
<i>Put a rush on the bus.
I repeat, put a rush on the bus!</i>

158
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,311
<i>Central,
notify highways, blood banks.</i>

159
00:16:09,444 --> 00:16:11,878
<i>Emergency Adam.
Main Central, show us en route.</i>

160
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:13,844
<i>Officers down.</i>

161
00:16:19,677 --> 00:16:20,911
<i>Eight officers down.</i>

162
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:08,345
Captain McKenna.

163
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:11,245
Okay, boys.

164
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:15,178
Detective Davis.

165
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:19,078
Captain McKenna runs the 8-5.

166
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,078
These are his boys
that died tonight.

167
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:23,744
My condolences.

168
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:26,044
Thank you.

169
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,477
It's Andre, right?

170
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:29,410
Yes, sir.

171
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:33,044
I never met your dad,
but I heard good things.

172
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,611
Thank you, sir.

173
00:18:37,011 --> 00:18:39,044
Guys, I need you to get up.

174
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:41,345
You're sitting
in my crime scene.

175
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,644
Come on. He's got a job to do.

176
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:52,878
It's okay, Kelly.

177
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,444
I heard you were with IA today.

178
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,377
And I'd fucking love it if you
were right back there tomorrow.

179
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:13,245
If they give me cause.

180
00:19:13,377 --> 00:19:14,477
Cause?

181
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,677
Here's your fucking cause
right there. Okay?

182
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,044
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Give me the room.

183
00:19:21,178 --> 00:19:24,211
Your fucking cause times seven
lying dead in the fucking street.

184
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,510
Motherfuckers are giving you
all the reason you need...

185
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:29,044
Mac! You're not the only one
hurting here.

186
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,644
You're in public.

187
00:19:30,777 --> 00:19:32,811
The public who never sees shit
when a cop goes down.

188
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,345
Lower your voice.

189
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,744
What were their names?

190
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:41,410
Uh, yeah.

191
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:45,078
Jennifer Montgomery
in the ambulance.

192
00:19:45,844 --> 00:19:47,911
She's hanging on by a thread.

193
00:19:50,844 --> 00:19:53,911
Massimo Adams, Charlie Cobb.

194
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,410
Jake Dominguez
and Danny Williams.

195
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:02,245
Out on the street
is Marcus Fernandez.

196
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:04,611
What?

197
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:07,444
Marcus Fernandez.

198
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:08,878
I knew Marcus.

199
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:11,878
We were at the academy together.

200
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,078
Out there with Marcus...

201
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,944
is Reuben Kizer
and Patrick Graham.

202
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:21,178
Just so you know,

203
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,677
they leave behind four wives,

204
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:27,844
one fiancée,

205
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:31,011
six kids.

206
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,978
Three are my godkids.

207
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:37,211
Now I'm gonna go wake them up
in the middle of the night,

208
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:40,577
let them know
their lives are shattered.

209
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:43,345
You know the drill.

210
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:50,410
Look, I fucking refuse

211
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:52,744
to allow these families
to be traumatized even more

212
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:56,611
with fucking trials and appeals
and horseshit narratives,

213
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:59,978
parole hearings for, fuck,
three, four decades.

214
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:06,944
I'm asking you...

215
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,345
to protect them from that.

216
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:13,844
I understand.

217
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,410
Why were they here?

218
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:21,978
My guys interrupted a robbery.

219
00:21:24,744 --> 00:21:26,245
How much cocaine is this?

220
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,544
Crime Scene
estimates about 300 kilos

221
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:29,978
before the scumbags cut into it.

222
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:31,644
How much did they take?

223
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:33,144
About 50 keys.

224
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,677
One hundred and ten pounds.

225
00:21:35,345 --> 00:21:38,078
That's A1 weight.
You're looking at 25 years.

226
00:21:38,211 --> 00:21:39,878
Ninety-plus percent pure.

227
00:21:40,011 --> 00:21:42,078
Two million, plus or minus,
before you step on it.

228
00:21:42,211 --> 00:21:44,078
It's quadruple after.

229
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:47,410
Detective Andre Davis,
Detective Frankie Burns, DETF.

230
00:21:47,544 --> 00:21:49,811
- She'll be working with you.
- With me doing what?

231
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:52,311
This is the biggest coke seizure
in I don't know how long.

232
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,278
- Narcotics will be involved.
- I appreciate the politics.

233
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,111
But if I don't catch these guys in the
next three or four hours, they vanish.

234
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:00,111
I don't do fucking politics.

235
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:02,078
And she's not the second team.

236
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:03,844
You can either fight me
or use me.

237
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:34,044
You good?

238
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:35,911
We should
fucking kill ourselves.

239
00:22:36,044 --> 00:22:37,544
Don't be like that. Not now.

240
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,245
We just killed more cops
than I can fucking count, Ray.

241
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:41,711
I did all the killing.

242
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,911
You think they give a shit
about the body math?

243
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:45,777
They're gonna figure us out.

244
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,410
It was dark. We moved fast.
Car's not ours. Plates are stolen.

245
00:22:48,544 --> 00:22:51,044
It'll get solved, Ray.
All right?

246
00:22:51,178 --> 00:22:53,477
We both hate the fucking cops,
but they're smart.

247
00:22:53,611 --> 00:22:56,211
They're gonna figure out our
names by sunrise. We need to run.

248
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:58,377
We need a plan. We need money.

249
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:00,711
Fuck!

250
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,345
Employee?

251
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,144
Yeah. Came up whistle-clean.

252
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:10,211
No-scroll good citizen
named Tom Cheaver.

253
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:12,510
So, Tom took his bullet
from just a few feet.

254
00:23:12,644 --> 00:23:14,944
Notice the stippling
around the entrance wound.

255
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:17,078
And judging from
the proximity of that knife,

256
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:18,978
Tom tried to make a move.

257
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:20,844
Over here,

258
00:23:20,978 --> 00:23:21,978
double taps.

259
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:24,144
Automatic weapon, suppressed.

260
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:25,477
I say two shooters.

261
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,011
Where are you seeing that?

262
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,911
No one's smooth enough
to murder all these officers

263
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:31,577
and hit Tom
coming up with a knife.

264
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:35,178
And one guy probably isn't carrying
100-plus pounds of cocaine out by himself.

265
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:36,911
Yeah, but it could be
more than two.

266
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,711
Nah. Look at
the shell groupings.

267
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:41,410
One was back there. He hit Tom.

268
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:44,278
The second one came this way.

269
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:49,111
Then he murdered all four of us.

270
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:51,811
Yeah.

271
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:53,811
Second one's a talented killer.

272
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:07,011
You left a zero off,
motherfucker.

273
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:08,510
What?

274
00:24:08,644 --> 00:24:09,677
That wasn't 30 keys stepped on.

275
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:11,410
It was 300 pure.

276
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:12,577
Wasn't my fuckup.

277
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:14,078
Whose fuckup was it?

278
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,211
Hawk Tyler's, maybe?
He put the job out for bid.

279
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:18,178
But you guys
got something, right?

280
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:20,944
- Fifty keys.
- Well, good.

281
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:23,311
- Fuck you!
- I'm changing the deal.

282
00:24:23,944 --> 00:24:25,711
You're not selling it for us
anymore.

283
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,311
You're gonna bring us to Hawk,
and we're gonna sell it ourselves.

284
00:24:28,444 --> 00:24:29,611
And we're not splitting it
three ways.

285
00:24:29,744 --> 00:24:31,577
I owe a lot of money
to a lot of people...

286
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:34,410
Me and Ray have to run for
the rest of our fucking lives!

287
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:36,911
Hawk ain't gonna hear
new deals.

288
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:39,677
Yeah, well, Hawk
hasn't heard 50 pure yet.

289
00:24:41,544 --> 00:24:42,577
Give me your phone.

290
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:57,410
Hit.

291
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:59,510
We got a hit!

292
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,444
It's a red light cam.

293
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:04,878
Two men.

294
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:08,245
Alert everybody. Send it through
the mobile unit at Mosto's.

295
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,044
Detective Davis.

296
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,744
Sergeant Yolanda Bell,
shift supervisor at LMSI.

297
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:15,777
Good to know you, Yolanda Bell.

298
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,911
<i>We got something for you.</i>

299
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:33,178
How much you wanna bet when we find
that BMW, it's burnt to the chassis?

300
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:35,178
A nickel.

301
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:43,744
If you were gonna rob
660 pounds of coke,

302
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:46,345
would you drive a BMW two-door
to the job?

303
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:48,345
Would you bring
just one other guy with you?

304
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:51,044
Would you only take 50 keys?

305
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:54,577
No, no, and no.

306
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:57,410
They weren't expecting 300.

307
00:25:57,544 --> 00:25:59,345
They weren't expecting cops,
either.

308
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,377
This was either dumb luck...

309
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,044
or a setup.

310
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:07,944
No, fuck you!

311
00:26:08,078 --> 00:26:09,444
The FBI's here
because the shooters

312
00:26:09,577 --> 00:26:10,677
are out of the state by now.

313
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:12,078
Half hour
since the final whistle.

314
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,477
Please, make one more
sports analogy.

315
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:15,011
If and when we get confirmation

316
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:16,911
that they crossed over
to Jersey or Connecticut...

317
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:19,178
The mayor would prefer that the
FBI take over sooner than later.

318
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,844
The mayor shits on us
every chance he gets.

319
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:22,345
The fucking guy
eats pizza with a fork.

320
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:23,777
He wants them
brought to justice.

321
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:24,911
No shit.

322
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,577
Dre.

323
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:30,044
Toine.

324
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:31,677
How'd it go
with Internal Affairs?

325
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,377
I'm here,
so not the way you hoped.

326
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:36,410
Like I said, the mayor
wants them brought to justice,

327
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,777
i.e., arrested, arraigned,
put on trial.

328
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:41,677
Not killed in a gun battle,
the details of which are foggy.

329
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:43,410
Like the seven behind us?

330
00:26:44,178 --> 00:26:45,844
- Who are you?
- Narcotics.

331
00:26:45,978 --> 00:26:49,377
Beautiful. What could go wrong?
We got a narc and a trigger.

332
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:52,677
You better have perfect
diction, calling me a "trigger."

333
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,078
Cut the shit, everybody.

334
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,744
Has the mayor
got his thumb on this?

335
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:56,911
This an ask or an order?

336
00:26:58,078 --> 00:26:59,377
They're still in New York.

337
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:02,345
You don't walk away
with 50 keys of 90% pure

338
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:04,078
unless you have
a big local buyer.

339
00:27:04,211 --> 00:27:06,178
You don't move it far
unless you're into transport.

340
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:07,677
These guys were hitters,
not drivers.

341
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:08,744
You don't know that.

342
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:10,611
Good enough to kill seven cops,

343
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,078
dumb enough to run a red?

344
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,377
What they need to do
is sell the coke, vanish.

345
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,477
I'm not heading east.

346
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:16,510
Long Island runs out,

347
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:17,711
and it's all accountants

348
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,811
and dentists out that way,

349
00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:20,677
so I'm a sore thumb.

350
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,078
I'm not going to Queens.

351
00:27:22,211 --> 00:27:24,111
You don't wholesale coke
in the middle class.

352
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,278
I'm not staying in Brooklyn,
scene of the crime.

353
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,677
Plus, it's all pop-ups and
strollers and guys like you now.

354
00:27:29,811 --> 00:27:32,410
Anyone left on Staten Island who can move
this kind of weight as quick as they need?

355
00:27:32,544 --> 00:27:35,178
Not since the days before
Gotti murdered Castellano.

356
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:36,245
What about Jersey?

357
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:38,410
"Sopranos" was a TV show.

358
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:40,911
And upstate?
That's fucking ridiculous.

359
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:43,510
Ain't no way to move
50 keys of yayo in Utica.

360
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:44,711
Leaves Manhattan.

361
00:27:44,844 --> 00:27:46,178
Detective Davis?

362
00:27:46,311 --> 00:27:47,477
What, you got a hit for me?

363
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,477
911 call.

364
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:49,811
Black BMW, two-door,

365
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,577
on fire
in an alley in Chinatown.

366
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,577
Uh-oh, where's Chinatown?

367
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:54,911
Manhattan.

368
00:27:55,044 --> 00:27:56,744
- Feel good?
- It does.

369
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:59,510
- How long ago was the 911?
- Ninety seconds.

370
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,477
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

371
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:04,011
- For what?
- Everything about these guys,

372
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:06,044
save the speed camera,
has been competent so far.

373
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:07,878
- Yeah, so?
- They'll sell the coke, catch a train,

374
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:09,510
catch a cab, jack a car,

375
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,544
and we're right back to hoping
we get a hit from a cam

376
00:28:11,677 --> 00:28:13,944
before they vanish, show up
in Pennsylvania somewhere.

377
00:28:14,078 --> 00:28:16,311
Good point.
Whereas the FBI is national...

378
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,677
Close the island.

379
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:19,211
What island?

380
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:20,544
Manhattan.

381
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:25,510
You having a seizure?

382
00:28:25,644 --> 00:28:27,011
No, the mayor will buy it.

383
00:28:27,144 --> 00:28:29,078
He's in the low 30s,
crime is ticking up,

384
00:28:29,211 --> 00:28:31,311
homeless are pissing
in front of Tiffany's again,

385
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:33,911
and it's 1:00 a.m.,
not 1:00 p.m.

386
00:28:34,044 --> 00:28:35,510
Anything goes wrong,
you can blame us.

387
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:37,611
Something will go wrong,
and then you're all fucked.

388
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:41,510
We get the concept of sacrifice is
like quantum physics to a fucking fed.

389
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:44,044
The mayor can say he was listening
to his commanders in the field.

390
00:28:44,178 --> 00:28:45,577
Now, if your boss had a chance

391
00:28:45,711 --> 00:28:48,644
to catch the murderers
of seven New York City cops

392
00:28:48,777 --> 00:28:52,377
and chose not to, this city
would never forgive him.

393
00:28:57,978 --> 00:28:59,011
Catch them by 5:00.

394
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:00,878
Wait, is that a yes or a no?

395
00:29:01,011 --> 00:29:03,178
Catch them by 5:00.

396
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:05,577
You all got balls,

397
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:07,345
not a lot of brains.

398
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,178
Good luck to you.

399
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:11,744
We'll be awaiting
your phone call.

400
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:13,377
Yeah, hold your breath.

401
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:18,078
How you gonna do this?

402
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:24,178
There are 21 bridges in and out
of Manhattan. Shut them down.

403
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:38,011
Three rivers, close them.
Four tunnels, block them.

404
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,611
Stop every train that leaves the island.
Amtrak, PATH, New Jersey Transit,

405
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:50,711
LIRR, Metro-North,
and loop the subways.

406
00:29:50,844 --> 00:29:51,711
Then...

407
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,311
we flood the island with blue.

408
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:48,011
You wanna ditch a car,
you drive five blocks, not to Manhattan.

409
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:50,245
Two sets of tire tracks.

410
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,011
This was a meet-and-greet.

411
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,711
Miss Yolanda.

412
00:30:57,377 --> 00:31:00,911
Hey, I need pictures of every car that
went into the alley after the BMW.

413
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:03,677
<i>There aren't any cameras
aimed right at the entrances.</i>

414
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:06,978
Alley backs up into massage
parlors and Chinese restaurants.

415
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:10,677
It's illegal workers. Every time a
camera goes up, it gets pulled back down.

416
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:13,011
Can you pick up every
passing vehicle on either end?

417
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:14,377
<i>What interval?</i>

418
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,611
From the time the BMW
went into the alley

419
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,978
to the first fire call to 911.

420
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,944
Will do. Stand by.

421
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,844
Are you who they say you are?

422
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:29,677
Who do they say I am?

423
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:31,544
You tell me.

424
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,245
You killed a lot of perps
in the last ten years.

425
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,211
Never shot first.

426
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:40,111
Never?

427
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,245
All right, let me be
more precise, Detective Burns.

428
00:31:44,377 --> 00:31:47,078
I've never fired
without just cause.

429
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:51,278
Seven dead cops feels like
a lot of just cause.

430
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,644
These guys are killers.

431
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:59,510
So I need to know that we got
each other's backs tonight.

432
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:01,878
'Cause I got a kid at home.

433
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:03,878
Doesn't need to wake up
without her mother.

434
00:32:04,011 --> 00:32:06,178
You wear that badge,
I got your back.

435
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:09,878
Talk to me.

436
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:14,311
All right.

437
00:32:14,444 --> 00:32:16,211
- Where we going?
- Uptown.

438
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:28,144
<i>...has closed all
access into and out of Manhattan.</i>

439
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,311
<i>In a statement from city hall,
the mayor's office was only able to offer</i>

440
00:32:31,444 --> 00:32:34,078
<i>a vague description
of the two suspects.</i>

441
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:37,878
<i>They tell us both are men.
One is white, one is black.</i>

442
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:41,211
<i>They are known to be armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

443
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:44,711
<i>Deputy Mayor Antoine Mott defends
the decision to lock down the city.</i>

444
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:48,178
<i>His statement says, "With no way off
the island for these two fugitives,</i>

445
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:50,044
<i>the NYPD has every available...</i>

446
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,577
- Nice.
- <i>...officer scouring Manhattan.</i>"

447
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:54,544
How much have you got?

448
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:56,044
Fifty kilos.

449
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:03,345
<i>..."until this manhunt
is successfully completed."</i>

450
00:33:06,744 --> 00:33:08,611
- What up, B?
- What up?

451
00:33:08,744 --> 00:33:10,345
This ain't usual and customary.

452
00:33:10,477 --> 00:33:12,211
Nothing is tonight, man.

453
00:33:13,711 --> 00:33:15,744
This is Ray Jackson.

454
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:17,345
And this is Michael...

455
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:19,510
The bid you put out
was for 30 keys.

456
00:33:19,644 --> 00:33:20,711
We walked in on 300.

457
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:22,510
Sometimes lightning strikes,
right?

458
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,744
And even better when you're
a borough away from it.

459
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,345
Yeah, most definitely.

460
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:28,510
Look, we killed cops,
and now we gotta run forever.

461
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:32,410
Then get on with your negotiations
and fuck your little guilt trip, word?

462
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,611
I'm a drug dealer
who hit a rival drug dealer,

463
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:36,677
and you're the guns
I got to do it.

464
00:33:37,144 --> 00:33:39,677
You think I fucked you because
someone somewhere forgot a zero?

465
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:44,211
Our business doesn't attract a lot
of detail-oriented motherfuckers.

466
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:47,211
You don't like it,
make your own moves.

467
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:49,544
Or go drive an Uber.
Either way, let's make this deal

468
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:51,677
so I can get you America's
Most Wanted motherfuckers

469
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,844
out of my crib fast as I can.

470
00:33:58,577 --> 00:33:59,544
One million.

471
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:03,777
Pesos?

472
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:07,878
Yo! I love it when fools strike gold
but don't know the market price.

473
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,245
Fifty keys cuts into 200.

474
00:34:10,377 --> 00:34:13,311
Going rate for a cut key
in Manhattan is 32 G's.

475
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:14,978
That means
after a million to us,

476
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:17,477
that's still 5.4 million
for you.

477
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:20,944
He's one of those
detail-oriented motherfuckers.

478
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:39,510
Police!
Don't move! Search warrant!

479
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,345
To the left!

480
00:34:45,278 --> 00:34:46,410
Police! Show me your hands!

481
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:47,544
Turn around!

482
00:34:47,677 --> 00:34:48,677
Hey, come on.

483
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:51,477
What's going on?

484
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:54,711
Get off of him!
No, he didn't do anything!

485
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:55,777
He can't breathe!

486
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,078
You know if you kill him,

487
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:58,611
he can't tell us anything?

488
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:01,711
- Stand up. Step over here.
- Okay.

489
00:35:02,878 --> 00:35:04,844
What's going on?
Is this you?

490
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:07,844
- No, that is not my car.
- It's registered in your name.

491
00:35:07,978 --> 00:35:10,744
My ex-boyfriend, he had terrible
credit, so I put it in my name.

492
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:11,911
He said he sold it!

493
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,144
- He lied.
- All the time.

494
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,644
You beat up the wrong man!

495
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:15,711
He'll live.

496
00:35:15,844 --> 00:35:16,844
Get him out of here.

497
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:18,345
Let's go.

498
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:20,211
Hey. You okay?

499
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:21,644
Turn around.

500
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:24,744
Oh, God.

501
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:27,510
Knock it off. Knock it off.

502
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:29,211
It's all right. It's all right.

503
00:35:30,245 --> 00:35:32,777
So, this ex-boyfriend
of yours...

504
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,611
Toriano Bush.

505
00:35:35,644 --> 00:35:38,544
- What'd he do now?
- Seven cops were murdered tonight.

506
00:35:40,044 --> 00:35:43,011
- Well, Toriano didn't do that.
- He picked up these two men.

507
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,711
We think they're the murderers.

508
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,844
There isn't a version of this
where these two aren't found.

509
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,311
Cooperate now.

510
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,811
Tell me something I don't know,

511
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,410
and that's the beginning of
the end of our time together.

512
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,744
Toriano couldn't
kill anyone, you know?

513
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:01,178
You said that.
But he's a criminal, right?

514
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:04,577
Small-time. Wanted to get out.
He was always just too deep in debt.

515
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:06,044
Is that why you left him?

516
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,211
Debt don't bother me.

517
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:11,144
Who was Becky
with the good hair?

518
00:36:13,811 --> 00:36:15,978
This waitress ho at the Pan-Am.

519
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:18,345
- Check it.
- Thank you.

520
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:26,178
Sit.

521
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:31,677
Give us a sec.

522
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,178
Hey, Yolanda, get me everything
you have on Toriano Bush.

523
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:40,711
And get cameras up and around
the Pan-Am Lounge.

524
00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:41,811
He has a girlfriend there.

525
00:36:41,944 --> 00:36:43,011
<i>Got it.</i>

526
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,245
You have it in hundreds?

527
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:56,744
Brown people spend Benjamins,

528
00:36:56,878 --> 00:36:58,278
brown people get followed.

529
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:00,510
Weighs as much as the coke.

530
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:01,611
You about right.

531
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:03,944
A million in 20s is 110 pounds.

532
00:37:04,078 --> 00:37:06,278
And stay away from all canines.

533
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,677
They go <i>Cujo</i> because every dollar in
circulation is covered in cocaine atoms,

534
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,044
and y'all got 50,000 of those
bills in six small bags.

535
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:13,911
- How do I clean it?
- You don't know some dude who owns a strip club

536
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:16,644
- or a parking lot?
- This is seven figures.

537
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,345
Who do you use?

538
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:21,345
Who everybody else with
seven or more digits does.

539
00:37:21,477 --> 00:37:24,410
Sudanese brother over in
the Meatpacking named Adi.

540
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:26,644
Cops, too. He's Switzerland.

541
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:27,878
What does that mean?

542
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,611
Means he's gonna take 300,000,

543
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:31,978
but he can sort bank accounts,
passports, whatever you need.

544
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:34,444
I heard about this dude.
Exclusive.

545
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:38,178
He owe you money?

546
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:40,078
Bush owes everybody money.

547
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:43,078
Yeah? How much?

548
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:47,078
$17,512, as of this morning.

549
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:49,011
What are you doing?

550
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,911
I just bought your Lincoln.

551
00:37:58,811 --> 00:37:59,844
Let's get out of here.

552
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:03,410
They'll never know.

553
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:06,211
You'll never see me again.

554
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,611
I promise.

555
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,544
Yeah, that's...

556
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:21,178
probably Raymond Jackson.

557
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:22,644
"Probably"?

558
00:38:22,777 --> 00:38:24,544
Because he always wears
a demon mask?

559
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:29,377
Not many white dudes born and raised
where we were during World War Crack.

560
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,711
Okay.

561
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:32,777
So he's a tough guy.

562
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,245
Yeah, fighting his whole life.

563
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,477
When we were kids,

564
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:40,444
I watched him beat a grown man

565
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:45,410
for stepping on this boy
Arvell's sneakers.

566
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:46,978
This was before the army.

567
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:48,644
Arvell?

568
00:38:48,777 --> 00:38:50,078
Who's Arvell?

569
00:38:50,978 --> 00:38:52,211
Arvell Trujillo.

570
00:38:53,377 --> 00:38:55,644
He and Ray,
they joined up together.

571
00:38:55,777 --> 00:38:58,178
They just did everything
together.

572
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,377
Is that who else is in the car?

573
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,711
No.

574
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,044
Arvell was blown up
in Afghanistan.

575
00:39:13,544 --> 00:39:15,178
The other man in that car...

576
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:20,677
is probably Arvell's
little brother, Michael.

577
00:39:21,211 --> 00:39:23,245
Because Ray protects him now.

578
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:27,510
Michael's smart, you know?

579
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:28,911
He could have been anything

580
00:39:29,044 --> 00:39:31,345
if he'd have just been born
somewhere else.

581
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,677
But after Arvell was killed,

582
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,544
Michael joined up.

583
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:40,111
But I heard
he attacked a sergeant.

584
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:43,211
Okay.

585
00:39:44,844 --> 00:39:46,044
Thank you.

586
00:40:25,044 --> 00:40:26,911
- Come on in.
- <i>We are getting reports</i>

587
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:31,377
<i>of huge traffic jams at the outbound
entrances, bridges, and tunnels.</i>

588
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,377
<i>No one is getting off
this island tonight.</i>

589
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,278
You're causing quite a stir.

590
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,178
<i>...wanted for
the slaughter of seven officers</i>

591
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:45,278
<i>in Brooklyn tonight are Raymond
Jackson and Michael Trujillo.</i>

592
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,178
<i>Jackson, at 32 years old,
a long history of violent crime.</i>

593
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:52,510
<i>Trujillo, 26 years old,
also with an extensive rap sheet.</i>

594
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:54,878
<i>Both men are ex-military...</i>

595
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:56,878
Put your bags in here.

596
00:40:57,011 --> 00:40:59,811
<i>Trujillo was
dishonorably discharged.</i>

597
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:01,044
Fuck.

598
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:04,477
<i>We're just getting a statement
from the NYPD, just issued.</i>

599
00:41:04,611 --> 00:41:08,944
<i>We have been told that the injured
officer, Jennifer Montgomery,</i>

600
00:41:09,078 --> 00:41:14,211
<i>was taken off life support and
declared dead just minutes ago.</i>

601
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:32,577
Don't wanna count it?

602
00:41:33,311 --> 00:41:35,978
No one cheats the man who
knows where all their money is.

603
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:39,178
Do not close that fucking safe.

604
00:41:39,311 --> 00:41:40,245
What the fuck are you doing?

605
00:41:40,377 --> 00:41:41,777
- I don't buy it.
- Buy what?

606
00:41:41,911 --> 00:41:42,878
This guy, this place.

607
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:44,044
Where the fuck are we, Mike?

608
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:45,611
What are we doing?
This isn't us.

609
00:41:45,744 --> 00:41:47,577
We have a million
in fucking cash.

610
00:41:47,711 --> 00:41:49,611
You ever think we'd see that?

611
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:51,878
You ever think Arvell
even dreamed of this shit?

612
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:53,644
Now we're just gonna give it
to him? Then what?

613
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,377
He's gonna put it
in the fucking safe, type,

614
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,078
and give us
some fucking gift cards?

615
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:00,777
- It's that easy?
- Bush knew about this dude.

616
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:05,345
"Exclusive," remember?
Bush heard about him.

617
00:42:06,044 --> 00:42:08,111
Fucking Toriano's
how all this started.

618
00:42:08,245 --> 00:42:10,944
No, us not walking away
is how this started.

619
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:14,477
Look, Ray, I get it.
None of this shit makes any sense.

620
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:17,377
It ain't like anything
we've ever known.

621
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,677
But ain't no plan B I can see.

622
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:22,377
They shut down the island.

623
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:25,677
We can't run around with
100 pounds of stained cash.

624
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:28,811
He puts this money in some
accounts somewhere far from here,

625
00:42:28,944 --> 00:42:30,544
and then we figure out
how to get to it later.

626
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:34,178
Ray, put it down.

627
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:42,777
You fuck us,

628
00:42:42,911 --> 00:42:45,744
and I will fucking bury you
where you stand.

629
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:07,311
I need a fucking scotch.

630
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:09,078
I'll pour us both one.

631
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:20,444
We got a match.

632
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:22,510
We got a hit.

633
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:23,911
<i>Bush is at the club.</i>

634
00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:26,644
Positive ID on Toriano Bush
at the Pan-Am.

635
00:43:27,178 --> 00:43:29,978
Closest units,
converge on the Pan-Am Lounge.

636
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,311
Toriano Bush inside.

637
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:32,911
<i>Stay on the exits.</i>

638
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:35,144
<i>Nobody enters until I get there.</i>

639
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:58,911
No, no! Listen to me, baby.

640
00:44:01,278 --> 00:44:02,311
Police! Drop it!

641
00:44:05,178 --> 00:44:07,144
- Bush!
- Get the fuck back!

642
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,677
- Hey, get the fuck back!
- I'm an EMT.

643
00:44:09,811 --> 00:44:11,345
I don't give a shit!
Get the fuck back!

644
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:21,510
Out of the way.
Get out of the way!

645
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:22,911
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

646
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:24,111
Move, move, move!

647
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,078
Come on, Andre.
Answer your fucking phone.

648
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:45,711
What the fuck is this?

649
00:44:45,844 --> 00:44:47,211
Hey!

650
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,377
- Didn't I say wait?
- We disobeyed.

651
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,111
- You disobeyed?
- He didn't kill one of your brothers.

652
00:44:52,245 --> 00:44:53,744
So fuck if I'm gonna
let him get away with...

653
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:55,844
What are you, fucking stupid?
He didn't kill anybody!

654
00:44:55,978 --> 00:44:57,744
He could have led us
to the two who did!

655
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:04,477
We yelled.
He pulled. We shot.

656
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:07,078
End of story.
One down, two to go.

657
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:08,677
That's fucking bullshit!

658
00:45:08,811 --> 00:45:10,078
Says the side piece
of a man who helped

659
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:11,544
fucking cop killers!

660
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:12,911
How many drinks
you have tonight?

661
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,911
Hey, don't do
what you're doing right now.

662
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:16,510
Get your fucking hands off me.

663
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:17,944
No!

664
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:20,611
What? What?

665
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:24,544
Officer,
get them the fuck out of here. Let's go.

666
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:29,078
You said Bush pulled.

667
00:45:30,011 --> 00:45:31,178
Pulled what?

668
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,844
A fucking .38?

669
00:45:32,978 --> 00:45:35,377
The other two got suppressed
submachine guns,

670
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,978
and Bush was carrying a piece you only
ever see in a meth addict's glove box...

671
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:42,044
or a fat cop's ankle holster.

672
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:43,911
Hey, whoa, whoa.

673
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:45,144
Who was that, LMSI?

674
00:45:45,278 --> 00:45:47,377
Nanny. Sorry.
My little girl's...

675
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:49,345
Is everything all right?

676
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,211
No, but we'll be fine.

677
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:54,711
What the fuck is going on here?

678
00:45:56,178 --> 00:45:57,878
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

679
00:46:07,444 --> 00:46:09,711
Bahamas is right
for your skin color.

680
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:11,477
You'll go via Miami.

681
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:13,311
Three hundred twenty-six
is short.

682
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:14,510
The rest is cash.

683
00:46:15,544 --> 00:46:18,178
You are now Christopher James.

684
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:22,844
And, Ray, your new name
is William Simpson.

685
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:27,677
Take separate buses to Miami.

686
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:30,345
There's a man named Swift
in Little Havana.

687
00:46:30,477 --> 00:46:32,811
He runs a bar at the corner
of Flagler and 27th Street.

688
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:36,144
He also sells passports.
They'll be under your new names.

689
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:39,178
Then you will pay cash
for a charter boat to Nassau.

690
00:46:39,311 --> 00:46:42,311
There is a ski boot bag
and backpack behind that door.

691
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:43,711
I'll put 15 in each...

692
00:46:47,211 --> 00:46:48,245
What was that?

693
00:46:48,377 --> 00:46:49,878
It's exactly
what it sounds like.

694
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:57,211
Whoever is at my door,
you wait and you think.

695
00:47:05,677 --> 00:47:07,311
NYPD! Open up!

696
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:19,844
What precinct are you from?

697
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:24,377
Because I'll have your fucking...

698
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:32,211
Going in!

699
00:47:42,211 --> 00:47:44,044
Fuck!

700
00:48:04,711 --> 00:48:06,311
You two
better not have fucked up.

701
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,544
Are we good?

702
00:48:13,178 --> 00:48:14,477
Is this my case, Captain?

703
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:16,644
This is all hands on deck,
but you're lead.

704
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:18,011
Someone should tell them.

705
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:19,644
Look, they're angry.

706
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:21,377
They're in pain.

707
00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:24,711
Butchco and his wife were
close with Jennifer Montgomery.

708
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:27,677
She didn't make it.
They just pulled the plug.

709
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:29,044
<i>10-13, we need backup!</i>

710
00:48:29,178 --> 00:48:30,544
This is Kelly!

711
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:33,410
We're on Ninth and 13th,
shots fired! 10-13!

712
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,911
<i>Ninth and 13th! Suspects
Trujillo and Jackson here!</i>

713
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,644
How the fuck
did Kelly find them?

714
00:48:50,377 --> 00:48:52,878
I can't see anything.

715
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:55,245
I can't fucking see.

716
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:58,011
We didn't fuck you over, man.
I swear.

717
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,044
Put those guns in your
mouths, you motherfuckers!

718
00:49:04,544 --> 00:49:06,211
Fucking 8-5.

719
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,211
What?

720
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,178
Throw your guns down,

721
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:10,311
you motherfuckers!

722
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:12,911
It's his thumb drives.

723
00:49:14,345 --> 00:49:15,711
The thumb drives!

724
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:40,078
What is it?

725
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,544
- "Coolhand."
- Huh?

726
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:47,878
"Coolhand," one word, lowercase.

727
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:50,144
Get the shotgun.
Get the shotgun!

728
00:49:51,477 --> 00:49:52,844
We gotta fucking move.

729
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:33,844
<i>All units,
suspects are 90Z on foot!</i>

730
00:50:33,978 --> 00:50:36,211
- Right there. Don't call it in.
- <i>Vicinity of Ninth and 13th.</i>

731
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:37,544
They're ours.

732
00:51:08,144 --> 00:51:09,410
We gotta split up.

733
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:11,744
We're too easy to track
if we're together.

734
00:51:11,878 --> 00:51:14,211
No. No way, man. You need help.

735
00:51:15,878 --> 00:51:17,510
Head down, eyes up.

736
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:23,345
I'll see you in Miami.

737
00:52:04,677 --> 00:52:05,777
Go!

738
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:06,944
Okay.

739
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,878
He ain't like me.

740
00:53:15,011 --> 00:53:16,278
He ain't like me.

741
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,311
Mike.

742
00:53:19,278 --> 00:53:20,544
He ain't like me.

743
00:54:24,777 --> 00:54:25,811
Is Ray dead?

744
00:54:26,444 --> 00:54:27,477
I hope so.

745
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,510
Michael?

746
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:38,944
Is he dead?

747
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:42,911
Yes.

748
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:45,211
Stop walking.

749
00:54:45,345 --> 00:54:47,245
You got a clear shot. Take it.

750
00:54:47,377 --> 00:54:48,577
Don't worry about me.

751
00:54:51,944 --> 00:54:52,911
You got lucky.

752
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:54,577
Yeah.

753
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:57,311
Luckier than the civilian
he just murdered.

754
00:54:59,044 --> 00:55:00,544
Add that to the list of cops.

755
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:03,377
How many bodies stacked up
against you now that Ray is dead?

756
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,245
- Don't try and get into my head, okay?
- Simple truths, Michael.

757
00:55:06,377 --> 00:55:07,345
And don't use my name!

758
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:08,944
Take the shot!

759
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,944
Stop fucking walking!

760
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,577
I think most of this mess
is his.

761
00:55:17,577 --> 00:55:19,611
But you're balls-deep
in it now, Michael.

762
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,711
For guys like Ray,
I'm natural causes.

763
00:55:24,844 --> 00:55:26,044
But what about you?

764
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,677
Fuck you know
about guys like Ray, huh?

765
00:55:28,811 --> 00:55:30,211
Fuck you know
about guys like me?

766
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:31,444
Saw your records.

767
00:55:32,644 --> 00:55:37,811
Marine. Tried to follow in your brother's
footsteps after he got sent home in a box.

768
00:55:38,644 --> 00:55:43,777
But you...
dishonorably discharged.

769
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:45,211
Insubordination.

770
00:55:45,777 --> 00:55:46,844
I get it.

771
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:49,911
Some of us are killers, Michael.

772
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:55,577
But you, I think the last thing you
want is to take a life for no reason.

773
00:55:57,544 --> 00:55:58,744
And how you know that, huh?

774
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:00,978
Because you would have
killed her by now.

775
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,211
Shoot him!

776
00:56:02,345 --> 00:56:04,044
- No!
- Fucking shoot him!

777
00:56:04,178 --> 00:56:05,677
Michael wants to talk.

778
00:56:05,811 --> 00:56:07,844
So, come on, Michael.
Let's talk.

779
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:11,377
He wants to talk, tell him to do it
without a gun to my fucking head, Andre.

780
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,611
Burns, be cool.

781
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,944
This is fucking cool.

782
00:56:14,078 --> 00:56:16,044
Just give me a second here.

783
00:56:18,477 --> 00:56:20,078
None of this shit
makes any sense.

784
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:24,677
The manager at the spot we hit,
he knew the cops were coming.

785
00:56:24,811 --> 00:56:26,278
It's called a silent alarm.

786
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,811
No. He checked his watch
before it all happened.

787
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:31,577
And the first four
came peacefully.

788
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:36,410
I mean, one fucking knocked with his
knuckles like a Jehovah's Witness,

789
00:56:36,544 --> 00:56:38,477
not with the side of his hand
like a fucking cop.

790
00:56:38,611 --> 00:56:41,510
Andre, for the love of Christ,
are you really gonna entertain this shit?

791
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:43,844
Three hundred keys, pure.

792
00:56:44,811 --> 00:56:46,011
I mean, what the fuck?

793
00:56:48,178 --> 00:56:50,211
This whole thing is filthy.

794
00:56:50,345 --> 00:56:54,211
You can't move that type of weight
around without cartels or cops or both.

795
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,477
And the cops shot
the Cleaner upstairs,

796
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:01,811
fired right through
the peephole, no warning.

797
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:04,677
They were there
for more than just us.

798
00:57:06,644 --> 00:57:09,477
And right before we left,
the Cleaner gave me thumb drives.

799
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:11,178
Gave what?

800
00:57:11,311 --> 00:57:12,444
Drives.

801
00:57:12,577 --> 00:57:13,777
USBs and shit.

802
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:19,377
- What's on them?
- Andre.

803
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,744
All he said was "8-5."

804
00:57:20,878 --> 00:57:22,278
Cop-killing piece of shit!

805
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,245
- There's no fucking...
- Burns, stop! Stop!

806
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:25,944
Michael, look at me.

807
00:57:26,078 --> 00:57:28,345
- Don't fuck with me!
- Nobody's fucking with you.

808
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:34,844
But facts: You shoot her,
I'm gonna kill you in the same breath.

809
00:57:34,978 --> 00:57:37,677
And everything you think you
know or may have means nothing.

810
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:42,677
So drop your weapon,
and let's take a look at the drives.

811
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:45,377
No. No, I can't do that.

812
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:47,544
- Michael, I need you to trust me.
- I don't trust anybody!

813
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:48,878
You have no choice.

814
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:54,711
You're not gonna escape to some island
somewhere, even after they open this one.

815
00:57:54,844 --> 00:57:56,544
You're smart enough
to know that.

816
00:57:57,544 --> 00:57:58,878
I am, huh?

817
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:00,577
The world's just gonna
keep closing in on you.

818
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:06,544
But you can survive this if you
just give yourself up to me.

819
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:09,911
No! Michael!

820
00:58:11,944 --> 00:58:12,944
No!

821
00:58:18,544 --> 00:58:19,544
Are you okay?

822
00:58:20,211 --> 00:58:21,744
What the fuck are you doing?

823
00:58:53,811 --> 00:58:55,744
This is Davis.

824
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:59,245
Lock down everything
in a seven-block radius

825
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:02,011
from Weichsel Beef's
center of the circle.

826
00:59:02,144 --> 00:59:06,544
Positive ID on Michael Trujillo
leaving there 90 seconds ago.

827
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:09,978
Trujillo has information
vital to this case.

828
00:59:10,711 --> 00:59:12,544
He must be brought in alive.

829
00:59:14,711 --> 00:59:16,345
- Let me see.
- I'm fine.

830
00:59:17,311 --> 00:59:18,311
Yeah, you look it.

831
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,744
I wanna know
what's on those drives.

832
00:59:21,844 --> 00:59:24,544
<i>Central, advise the
units that are 84 to set up a perimeter</i>

833
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:28,777
<i>from West 12th Street to West 19th
and from Eighth Avenue to the water.</i>

834
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:29,878
<i>No one in or out.</i>

835
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:07,245
What? Can you believe that?

836
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:09,510
Disgusting. It's disgusting.

837
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:11,978
And the pool
is on the 26th floor.

838
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:48,345
Shh!

839
01:00:51,477 --> 01:00:53,178
I won't hurt you
if you stay quiet.

840
01:00:54,311 --> 01:00:55,345
You got it?

841
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:58,178
Nod.

842
01:01:03,477 --> 01:01:05,144
Shit. Fuck.

843
01:01:09,377 --> 01:01:10,410
What's the password?

844
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:12,677
Um...

845
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:14,078
"Eightclap1."

846
01:01:14,677 --> 01:01:16,345
Gotta spell the word "eight."

847
01:01:16,477 --> 01:01:17,510
One is the number.

848
01:01:20,078 --> 01:01:21,911
- One word?
- Mm-hmm.

849
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:26,611
Close your eyes.

850
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,944
Why didn't you shoot him?

851
01:01:57,311 --> 01:01:58,911
They told me you were fearless.

852
01:01:59,577 --> 01:02:01,744
The guy who kills cop killers.

853
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,744
I just need the truth,
that's all.

854
01:02:04,878 --> 01:02:07,044
You believe a cop killer?

855
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:11,878
Good work, Kelly. Get some rest.

856
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:19,711
You took down
one vicious son of a bitch.

857
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:22,944
Yeah, not before he killed
an innocent civilian.

858
01:02:23,078 --> 01:02:25,078
World's a better place
with that guy gone.

859
01:02:26,144 --> 01:02:27,111
You seen his record?

860
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,178
Glanced at it.

861
01:02:30,878 --> 01:02:33,011
I knew I had the right guy
for this.

862
01:02:33,144 --> 01:02:35,211
All hands on deck, right?

863
01:02:35,844 --> 01:02:38,677
It was your boys who smoked
them out of this apartment.

864
01:02:38,811 --> 01:02:40,911
How did Lieutenant Kelly
even get here so quick?

865
01:02:41,044 --> 01:02:43,644
Look at this fucking mess.

866
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:46,844
- You still got one guy on the run, right?
- Yeah.

867
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:49,577
It's 4:37 a.m.

868
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:52,510
You've got less than an hour
before I gotta open the island.

869
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:55,777
You haven't gotten him by then,
we're all eating shit for breakfast.

870
01:02:55,911 --> 01:02:57,345
Don't worry about
the other perp.

871
01:02:57,477 --> 01:03:00,444
Andre put that motherfucker
in a seven-block box.

872
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:02,245
He's on borrowed time.

873
01:03:25,144 --> 01:03:27,211
<i>Michael
Trujillo is still at large,</i>

874
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,410
<i>but police believe he is surrounded
somewhere inside the Meatpacking District.</i>

875
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:34,178
<i>The mayor's office
has praised NYPD officers</i>

876
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,544
<i>for the progress
they've made in this manhunt.</i>

877
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:39,577
<i>Deputy Mayor Antoine Mott
had this to say</i>

878
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:42,044
<i>in a press briefing
just moments ago.</i>

879
01:03:42,178 --> 01:03:44,644
<i>Mayor Drum cut
short his trade mission to the EU</i>

880
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:47,245
<i>and is already on a plane home
from Brussels.</i>

881
01:03:47,377 --> 01:03:50,978
<i>Asked me to pass along his gratitude
to the citizens of this city.</i>

882
01:03:51,111 --> 01:03:53,211
<i>"World's greatest," his words.</i>

883
01:03:53,345 --> 01:03:55,377
<i>Without your patience
and assistance,</i>

884
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:57,878
<i>and, I'll add, the boldness
of Mayor Drum's idea</i>

885
01:03:58,011 --> 01:03:59,878
<i>to close Manhattan
in the first place,</i>

886
01:04:00,011 --> 01:04:03,611
<i>we wouldn't have already neutralized
two of the three men responsible</i>

887
01:04:03,744 --> 01:04:05,544
<i>for the ambush at Mosto's</i>

888
01:04:05,677 --> 01:04:07,844
<i>that claimed the lives
of eight of our finest</i>

889
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:10,011
<i>from the 85th Precinct
last night.</i>

890
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:12,844
<i>A gunman identified as
Raymond Jackson</i>

891
01:04:12,978 --> 01:04:15,345
<i>and his accomplice,
Toriano Bush,</i>

892
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:19,410
<i>both died resisting arrest in
the early hours of this morning.</i>

893
01:04:19,544 --> 01:04:22,011
<i>Both men were armed
and dangerous.</i>

894
01:04:22,144 --> 01:04:25,044
<i>Our brave officers
at the 85th Precinct...</i>

895
01:04:25,178 --> 01:04:26,345
Eighty-fifth.

896
01:04:27,311 --> 01:04:28,611
"Eight-five."

897
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:32,611
<i>We believe
we have the third man,</i>

898
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,878
<i>Michael Trujillo,
within our grasp.</i>

899
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:36,211
Eighty-five.

900
01:04:36,345 --> 01:04:38,211
<i>We ask all residents
to shelter in place</i>

901
01:04:38,345 --> 01:04:42,544
<i>while we apprehend Trujillo and
hold him accountable for his crimes.</i>

902
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:43,811
Badge numbers.

903
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:47,577
Every number's a cop.

904
01:05:18,777 --> 01:05:20,811
Help! Help! Help!

905
01:05:27,878 --> 01:05:30,278
Could I speak to the
director of security, please?

906
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,078
I'm sorry, Officer,
just one moment.

907
01:05:32,211 --> 01:05:33,377
Reception.

908
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,078
What?

909
01:05:45,944 --> 01:05:48,978
Sir, you can't be back here.

910
01:05:49,978 --> 01:05:51,345
Where are we going?

911
01:05:53,245 --> 01:05:55,144
We gotta bring him in alive.

912
01:05:56,144 --> 01:05:59,044
<i>...assault at the
Parallax Hotel. Sounds like Trujillo.</i>

913
01:05:59,178 --> 01:06:01,544
<i>Direction of flight was
through the kitchen at rear.</i>

914
01:06:02,144 --> 01:06:04,044
That's 13th Street. Lock him in.

915
01:06:04,178 --> 01:06:05,611
Nobody approach him! He's mine!

916
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:12,711
Sir, stop.

917
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:14,844
Hold it right there!
Show me your hands!

918
01:06:26,844 --> 01:06:29,078
Take the car!
Cut him off on the other side!

919
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:55,178
Don't shoot!

920
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:38,644
Trujillo! Drop your weapon!

921
01:08:49,444 --> 01:08:51,510
<i>Police.
Stop, drop on the ground.</i>

922
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:03,577
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

923
01:10:50,777 --> 01:10:52,078
Police.

924
01:10:52,211 --> 01:10:54,577
Police, don't move,
don't move, don't move.

925
01:10:55,944 --> 01:10:58,345
Clear the doorway.
Clear the doorway.

926
01:10:58,477 --> 01:10:59,911
Clear the doorway.

927
01:11:00,544 --> 01:11:02,744
NYPD. Take cover.

928
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:04,410
Clear! Clear!

929
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:05,911
Come on, clear!

930
01:11:08,011 --> 01:11:10,844
Police. Clear, clear.

931
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:14,044
Out of the way. NYPD.
Take cover.

932
01:11:16,144 --> 01:11:17,844
Move. Move. Move.

933
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:23,577
Clear. Clear. Clear.

934
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:28,911
Drop it!

935
01:11:33,844 --> 01:11:36,844
You're the only cop tonight who
speaks first and shoots second.

936
01:11:36,978 --> 01:11:40,410
It's fucking morning,
and you killed eight of us.

937
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:42,345
Not all eight were clean.

938
01:11:43,311 --> 01:11:44,844
Who cares?

939
01:11:44,978 --> 01:11:46,011
You do.

940
01:11:48,144 --> 01:11:49,911
How do you know
I'm any different?

941
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:54,644
Because you would have
shot me by now.

942
01:11:57,377 --> 01:11:59,544
Where are those drives
we were talking about?

943
01:12:01,477 --> 01:12:02,544
I stashed them.

944
01:12:03,978 --> 01:12:05,178
Okay.

945
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:08,744
Give them to me,
and I'll keep you alive.

946
01:12:08,878 --> 01:12:10,078
No.

947
01:12:10,211 --> 01:12:12,044
You want the drives,
you let me go.

948
01:12:12,178 --> 01:12:15,677
If you don't walk out with me,
you'll be carried out by others.

949
01:12:17,144 --> 01:12:19,577
Michael, your only hope
is to tell the truth,

950
01:12:20,311 --> 01:12:22,345
pray to God for forgiveness,

951
01:12:23,178 --> 01:12:25,577
and make peace with the fact
that you may die in prison.

952
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:29,944
Shooting you sounds
a whole lot better right now.

953
01:12:30,078 --> 01:12:32,111
You don't want my face
and this dirty subway

954
01:12:32,245 --> 01:12:33,911
to be the last things
you ever see.

955
01:12:34,044 --> 01:12:37,044
If I die, you'll never find
out what's on those drives.

956
01:12:40,044 --> 01:12:41,744
I may not find the drives,

957
01:12:41,878 --> 01:12:43,911
but I will find out
why tonight happened.

958
01:12:44,044 --> 01:12:45,811
But could you prove it?

959
01:12:47,144 --> 01:12:49,377
I only have to prove it
to myself.

960
01:12:57,944 --> 01:12:59,577
Come on, Michael.

961
01:13:06,744 --> 01:13:07,844
Come on.

962
01:13:13,178 --> 01:13:14,211
Okay.

963
01:13:17,677 --> 01:13:18,744
Okay.

964
01:13:19,377 --> 01:13:20,377
Okay.

965
01:13:29,677 --> 01:13:31,211
Cease fire!

966
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:32,711
Cease fire!

967
01:13:33,544 --> 01:13:35,245
Cease fire!

968
01:13:42,477 --> 01:13:44,345
What the fuck?

969
01:13:45,878 --> 01:13:47,711
What the fuck, man?

970
01:13:49,178 --> 01:13:51,978
He was surrendering.
He was giving himself up.

971
01:13:52,510 --> 01:13:53,844
He was gonna shoot you.

972
01:13:53,978 --> 01:13:56,245
You didn't see the gun down?

973
01:13:56,377 --> 01:13:58,377
You didn't fucking see
the gun down?

974
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:00,844
I thought he was gonna shoot.

975
01:14:14,811 --> 01:14:17,577
Central, this is homicide 4-3.
Do you copy?

976
01:14:20,245 --> 01:14:22,377
Central, do you copy?

977
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:26,444
Be advised, we have shots
fired on the 6 train

978
01:14:26,577 --> 01:14:28,011
coming into Grand Central.

979
01:14:28,144 --> 01:14:30,677
Suspect is down.
Suspect is down.

980
01:14:32,011 --> 01:14:33,345
"Coolhand."

981
01:14:33,878 --> 01:14:35,178
Do you copy?

982
01:14:38,011 --> 01:14:39,178
Central?

983
01:14:39,777 --> 01:14:40,844
"Coolhand."

984
01:14:40,978 --> 01:14:42,111
Central, do you copy?

985
01:14:43,711 --> 01:14:44,844
Central?

986
01:14:50,677 --> 01:14:53,078
Central, advise if you receive
my transmission.

987
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:54,510
Shit.

988
01:15:57,978 --> 01:15:59,144
Is he gone?

989
01:16:00,844 --> 01:16:02,410
What do you think?

990
01:16:02,544 --> 01:16:04,844
I think they called
the right man for the job.

991
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:08,577
Hey. Good job.
You did great work.

992
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:10,144
Way to go. Well done.

993
01:16:12,644 --> 01:16:14,245
Congratulations, Detective.

994
01:16:14,377 --> 01:16:15,811
Thank you, sir.

995
01:16:17,978 --> 01:16:19,245
- Amazing.
- Thanks, guys.

996
01:16:30,677 --> 01:16:31,744
Hey.

997
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:33,178
What's up?

998
01:16:33,311 --> 01:16:35,278
- This fucking thing is dead.
- Oh.

999
01:16:36,011 --> 01:16:37,410
Can I borrow yours?

1000
01:16:37,544 --> 01:16:39,211
Yeah, of course.

1001
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:41,345
- I'll bring it right back.
- Sure.

1002
01:16:58,345 --> 01:16:59,978
Good work, Detective.

1003
01:17:02,644 --> 01:17:04,044
Great job, Burns.

1004
01:17:04,477 --> 01:17:05,711
Thanks, Kelly.

1005
01:17:09,111 --> 01:17:10,245
- How's the hand?
- Okay.

1006
01:17:13,477 --> 01:17:15,011
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

1007
01:17:18,878 --> 01:17:20,144
Voice mail.

1008
01:17:21,477 --> 01:17:22,577
Shit.

1009
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,878
It's been a long night.
You get some rest.

1010
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,211
Yeah, you too.

1011
01:17:31,811 --> 01:17:33,544
Go hug that daughter of yours.

1012
01:18:18,811 --> 01:18:20,744
<i>Manhattan
reopened at 7:05 this morning</i>

1013
01:18:20,878 --> 01:18:25,377
<i>after a night of carnage that
saw eight police officers...</i>

1014
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:28,278
<i>...into and out of

1017
01:18:32,477 --> 01:18:35,410
<i>in what looked and felt like
a military invasion.</i>

1018
01:18:49,345 --> 01:18:50,711
What's up?

1019
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:54,510
Goddammit.

1020
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:56,711
Okay, all right, calm down.

1021
01:18:56,844 --> 01:18:59,211
Just come over to my place.

1022
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:01,878
Yeah.

1023
01:19:03,211 --> 01:19:04,377
I understand.

1024
01:19:05,611 --> 01:19:07,011
We'll figure something out.

1025
01:19:07,711 --> 01:19:08,811
Just...

1026
01:19:12,144 --> 01:19:13,811
I gotta go.

1027
01:19:13,944 --> 01:19:15,078
I got a visitor.

1028
01:19:19,777 --> 01:19:21,410
Put your gun down here.

1029
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:43,278
Who was on the phone?

1030
01:19:44,711 --> 01:19:45,911
My wife.

1031
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:49,011
She's a nurse.

1032
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:51,044
Shift just started.

1033
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:55,111
And that's the story
of all married life.

1034
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:03,878
Guy that owned Mosto's
was your partner.

1035
01:20:05,644 --> 01:20:07,410
Mosto's was your vault.

1036
01:20:08,144 --> 01:20:13,044
The 8-5 was armored security, moving
drugs around the city in NYPD vehicles.

1037
01:20:14,178 --> 01:20:17,044
Last night was just fucking
bad luck on every level.

1038
01:20:17,844 --> 01:20:21,911
A rival hits Mosto's at the same time
your boys drop by to move a load of coke,

1039
01:20:22,811 --> 01:20:25,744
run into men
with training, die, badly.

1040
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:31,911
Those men with training escape,
sell the drugs and clean the money,

1041
01:20:32,044 --> 01:20:34,744
coincidentally with
the same launderer you use.

1042
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:39,544
And you scorch earth
trying to cover it all up.

1043
01:20:43,811 --> 01:20:44,944
You're really good.

1044
01:20:47,178 --> 01:20:48,377
Not good enough.

1045
01:20:51,544 --> 01:20:54,144
Not all the cops killed
last night were a part of it.

1046
01:20:54,278 --> 01:20:57,410
Clean or dirty,
they're all dead 'cause of you.

1047
01:21:01,878 --> 01:21:03,311
So you know,

1048
01:21:05,711 --> 01:21:11,078
this is not about Cadillacs and
fucking Rolexes, material bullshit.

1049
01:21:13,444 --> 01:21:15,544
Not for me.
Not for most of my guys.

1050
01:21:16,677 --> 01:21:18,178
It's about having a life.

1051
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:26,078
My first month running the 8-5,
I went to two of my cops' funerals.

1052
01:21:27,644 --> 01:21:30,744
First one went 60 miles an
hour into a bridge abutment.

1053
01:21:32,544 --> 01:21:34,510
His blood alcohol was .25.

1054
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:36,744
Second guy
drank himself to death too.

1055
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:38,844
Cirrhosis.

1056
01:21:40,510 --> 01:21:42,711
Three of my cops
had their homes foreclosed on.

1057
01:21:44,844 --> 01:21:46,111
Another guy lost his apartment.

1058
01:21:46,245 --> 01:21:48,544
Shitty landlord
doubled the rent.

1059
01:21:48,677 --> 01:21:52,011
The divorce rate in the 8-5
was over 70%.

1060
01:21:54,078 --> 01:21:56,078
This is about my cops
staying married,

1061
01:21:58,211 --> 01:21:59,878
raising their kids,

1062
01:22:00,011 --> 01:22:02,844
not having to spend four hours
a day sitting in traffic,

1063
01:22:02,978 --> 01:22:05,844
crawling to and from a city
they can't afford to live in,

1064
01:22:06,444 --> 01:22:09,311
a city that actively
fucking dislikes them.

1065
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:14,144
But a city that they protect...

1066
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:18,711
with their lives
every fucking day.

1067
01:22:22,311 --> 01:22:23,644
That's what this is about.

1068
01:22:28,211 --> 01:22:32,011
I'll tell you what, anybody tells you
money can't buy happiness is full of shit.

1069
01:22:34,044 --> 01:22:35,677
And the 8-5 is proof.

1070
01:22:39,811 --> 01:22:41,944
Frankie Burns is proof.

1071
01:22:44,345 --> 01:22:46,444
Did you put her on this just to
make sure I did your bidding?

1072
01:22:46,577 --> 01:22:49,078
I put her on this 'cause she
might be as good as you.

1073
01:22:50,410 --> 01:22:52,345
And she's got everything
to lose.

1074
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:08,345
Three guys murdered my father.

1075
01:23:10,345 --> 01:23:11,510
He took two with him.

1076
01:23:11,644 --> 01:23:12,677
But the third,

1077
01:23:15,144 --> 01:23:21,178
he hit my dad so many times he
broke every bone in his face.

1078
01:23:24,377 --> 01:23:26,510
That's why we had to have
a closed casket.

1079
01:23:30,111 --> 01:23:31,410
Guy told the judge...

1080
01:23:32,777 --> 01:23:34,677
he didn't even remember
doing it.

1081
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:36,978
He was so jacked, so...

1082
01:23:38,978 --> 01:23:41,711
so high on cocaine
and angel dust.

1083
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,377
The drugs
have always been there.

1084
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:48,044
And they always will be.

1085
01:23:48,178 --> 01:23:50,178
And people will always die
because of them.

1086
01:23:51,477 --> 01:23:56,677
That blood, that blood
cannot be on the badge.

1087
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:07,278
You can't prove where
those flash drives came from.

1088
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:13,978
And nobody is gonna
take the stand against me.

1089
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:20,844
So if you go down this road,
Andre, you're on your own.

1090
01:24:23,878 --> 01:24:26,878
You'll be looking over your
shoulder the rest of your life.

1091
01:24:27,811 --> 01:24:29,245
I know.

1092
01:24:33,878 --> 01:24:35,744
Or you could just look
the other way.

1093
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:40,577
I'd rather
look the devil in the eye.

1094
01:25:59,878 --> 01:26:01,078
I get you?

1095
01:26:04,644 --> 01:26:06,377
You wouldn't ask
if you didn't know.

1096
01:26:09,178 --> 01:26:11,178
Hurts like a motherfucker,
right?

1097
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,078
I'll live.

1098
01:26:18,711 --> 01:26:20,544
You can if you give yourself up.

1099
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,011
It's the only choice
available to you right now.

1100
01:26:27,811 --> 01:26:28,811
Maybe.

1101
01:27:41,311 --> 01:27:42,345
Don't do it.

1102
01:28:33,844 --> 01:28:34,878
He's gone.

1103
01:28:36,544 --> 01:28:37,677
It's over.

1104
01:28:39,178 --> 01:28:40,410
So put your gun down.

1105
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:48,410
I'm gonna turn around
and face you, Burns.

1106
01:28:48,544 --> 01:28:49,711
No.

1107
01:28:59,011 --> 01:29:00,245
I'm gonna turn around.

1108
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:11,245
I have the drives.

1109
01:29:12,311 --> 01:29:13,777
I copied them.

1110
01:29:15,111 --> 01:29:16,711
They're already
out in the world.

1111
01:29:22,544 --> 01:29:24,044
You're going down, Burns.

1112
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:30,044
Every dirty cop in the 8-5
is going down.

1113
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:34,345
You pull that trigger,
you get life.

1114
01:29:37,377 --> 01:29:39,844
Your daughter doesn't need to
grow up without her mother.

1115
01:30:03,345 --> 01:30:04,510
Badge too.
