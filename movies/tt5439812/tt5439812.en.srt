00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:24,591
You wanna hear a story about how
me and this bitch here fell out?

4
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,327
It's kinda long,
but it's full of suspense.

5
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:47,547
You could taste
that shit

6
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:48,783
before he walked
through the door.

7
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:51,886
It was fart. It was egg.
It was nasty.

8
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:54,421
What you call it again when
their skin get red like that?

9
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:58,425
- Rosacea?
- Yup. I saw that shit on TV.

10
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:00,160
Why it get like that?

11
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:03,330
<i>Gracias.</i>

12
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,668
Here we go.
I'll get you some ketchup.

13
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:10,636
I didn't like that place.

14
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:12,605
There was just
something about it.

15
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:14,574
It had the wrong air flow.

16
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,410
- I didn't tell you?
- Mmm-mmm.

17
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:19,546
It was like
the energy was off.

18
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:21,014
What table am I at?

19
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,654
Thanks, guys.

20
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:31,290
The closer you are to the
city, the prettier the girls.

21
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:32,926
I don't make the rules.

22
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,461
Hormones in the food help out
hormones in the water.

23
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:37,463
Chicken taste
like real chicken.

24
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,666
- Nah, that ain't chicken.
- Right.

25
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:43,270
- Y'all got jalapeno poppers?
- We don't.

26
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:46,140
<i>So I met
this white bitch at my job.</i>

27
00:02:46,206 --> 00:02:47,874
<i>I was her waitress.</i>

28
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,643
<i>She came in with this
old-ass, big-ass Black dude.</i>

29
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,847
Damn, bitch,
you got perfect titties!

30
00:02:53,914 --> 00:02:55,349
I wish I had titties
like that.

31
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:56,850
They look just like
little apples.

32
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,051
Thank you.

33
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:04,591
So you just gonna pull
that dyke shit

34
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,559
right in front of me
and not include me?

35
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:11,231
You so dumb.
Like, why you so dumb?

36
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:19,173
Every one of my tables
is Fruit Loops.

37
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,342
You said it, not me.

38
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:24,144
I'm tired.
I'm gonna take a break.

39
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:26,913
Girl...

40
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,252
I feel like we met.

41
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,857
- When?
- I don't know. You dance?

42
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:40,561
- Sometimes.
- I dance.

43
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:43,029
- Okay, bitch, me too.
- Cute.

44
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,700
You're not supposed
to be back here.

45
00:03:45,766 --> 00:03:49,169
- What you doing tonight?
- Nothing.

46
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:52,506
You wanna go somewhere with me?

47
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:59,239
Same bitch that won't dance
for money

48
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:02,743
be the same bitch that
be out on the block.

49
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:04,611
Same bitch that wanna smile
in your face

50
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,747
be the same bitch that
gonna come for you later.

51
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:11,284
- Period!
- On, God!

52
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,786
On, God!

53
00:05:12,852 --> 00:05:14,186
Like, why you on my Twitter?

54
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,256
Why you on my Facebook?
Why you on my Tumblr?

55
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:17,758
Why are you DM-ing me?

56
00:05:17,823 --> 00:05:18,991
- Sis, why you tagging me on photos?
- Sis!

57
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,327
- You don't even fuck with me.
- Sis!

58
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:21,729
- Lemme know! Lemme know!
- Sis.

59
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,330
- Lemme...
- Yeah, sis!

60
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:29,869
You gonna get that?

61
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,648
She looks like you.

62
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:43,016
You think so?

63
00:05:43,082 --> 00:05:44,818
I think she looks
like her daddy.

64
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:47,120
He got a lazy eye, though.
I hope she don't get that.

65
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,389
You got kids?

66
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:53,094
Time to go.

67
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,798
I'm hungry.

68
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:04,337
Put your number in.

69
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:12,812
You got my Twitter,
my Tumblr and my Facebook.

70
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:14,280
Follow for follow,
bitch.

71
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,650
Ay.

72
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,092
Hey, you wanna play this?

73
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:27,662
Come on, jump on it.

74
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,766
Oh. Shit, man!

75
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,339
I don't feel
like cooking tonight.

76
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:42,809
Where you wanna go?

77
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:49,250
You want me to choose?

78
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:52,952
Have you heard
anything I said?

79
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,725
Yo, why you looking at me
like that?

80
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,526
Yo, am I missing
something here?

81
00:07:43,602 --> 00:07:45,171
Hey.

82
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:48,875
Last month I went dancing
at this cute spot in Florida

83
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:52,245
where my roommate's girl
made like 5 Gs a night.

84
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,347
<i>My roommate just told me</i>

85
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:56,349
that he going
down there tomorrow

86
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,751
and he asked me
if I had any friends

87
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:00,152
that wanna make some money

88
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:02,921
and you the first bitch
I thought of.

89
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:06,058
Damn, bitch!
We just met yesterday

90
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,527
and you already trying
to take ho trips together?

91
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,767
When we leaving?

92
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:17,303
Be ready by 2:00.

93
00:08:19,505 --> 00:08:21,375
Who's all going?

94
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:24,211
Be ready by 2:00!

95
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:25,779
Who's all going?

96
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:29,048
Me, my boyfriend,
and my roommate.

97
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:31,117
<i>Last time I was there,</i>

98
00:08:31,183 --> 00:08:33,587
<i>I met a rapper who had a song
on the radio.</i>

99
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:35,422
Hey, who is that?

100
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:36,924
Text me your address.

101
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,892
You just dropped me off
the other night.

102
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,693
You think I remember, bitch?

103
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,762
I don't know
where I am right now.

104
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:45,531
I'm gonna have to fuck
my nigga calm.

105
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:46,832
Cute.

106
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
Yo, what's that look
on your face?

107
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,202
I'm going to Florida to dance.

108
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,602
Since when?

109
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,505
Did I ever say anything
to make you stop dancing?

110
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,975
You've been
trained to know better.

111
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,843
Oh, so, I'm trained?

112
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,444
When a man
don't have anything to say

113
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,848
about the way you make
your money, he don't like it.

114
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:03,382
So, what if I don't?

115
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,818
You know I'm working
on getting a better job.

116
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:08,389
Mmm-hmm.

117
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:11,591
- You like that?
- I do.

118
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,573
I'mma go to Florida
with this white girl I met

119
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:28,408
and we gonna dance.

120
00:09:28,942 --> 00:09:31,145
- Good?
- Good.

121
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:38,952
- Are you close?
- No!

122
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,522
Okay. Whoo!

123
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,830
Hey, bitch!

124
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:53,065
This is gonna be so fun.

125
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,702
- It's my bitch, Zola.
- Hey, bitch Zola.

126
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,740
<i>It'll be 48 hours
till I know this nigga's name.</i>

127
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,608
Baby bitch Zola.

128
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,510
It's gonna be so fun.

129
00:10:04,443 --> 00:10:06,746
- That's my purse.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

130
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:09,049
- Thank you.
- You got it.

131
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,486
Let's do it!

132
00:10:12,552 --> 00:10:15,890

00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,351
Yo, I'm gonna make videos
like this.

161
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,010
Premium.

162
00:12:18,077 --> 00:12:21,548
I'm so hungry,
I could eat a dick right now.

163
00:12:25,018 --> 00:12:26,553
You got tissue?

164
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:20,240
I swear on my life!
I swear on my momma's life!

165
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:23,043
I was like...
Like, "What?" Like, "Huh?"

166
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,412
Like, this dookie-ass bitch

167
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:28,380
with a nappy-ass head
was up in my face!

168
00:13:28,448 --> 00:13:31,150
I was like, "Look, if you
gonna slide up and down

169
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:34,286
"a pole all night in some
doo-do-ass drawers,

170
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:36,889
"clean your butt! Like, have
you some wet wipes, boo-boo,

171
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:40,092
"'cause nobody lookin' to get
Giardia on account of no ho!"

172
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,261
Like, not again!

173
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:45,265
Then this bitch was up
in my face!

174
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,700
I was like,
"Look, booger bitch,

175
00:13:47,766 --> 00:13:50,802
"best get your ghetto ass
up out my face."

176
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,539
"It's not my fault you nasty!

177
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:54,174
"It's not my fault I make
more money than you!"

178
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,110
- "Clean your butt!"
- "It's not my fault you nasty!

179
00:13:57,177 --> 00:13:58,579
"It's not my fault

180
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:00,078
- "I make more money than you!"
- "Clean your butt!"

181
00:14:00,145 --> 00:14:01,314
On God!

182
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,414
Turn that shit
the fuck up!

183
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,884
- Word.
- Yeah!

184
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:21,827
- Yo! Derrek.
- What's this?

185
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:23,996
A little spot,
just for a couple of hours.

186
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:27,534
- All of us?
- Thought you was tired.

187
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:29,635
- I'm not tired.
- You look tired.

188
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,405
I guess I'm tired.

189
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:39,378
You already look pretty.

190
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,383
Baby.

191
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:45,684
You know they filmed
<i>Miami Vice</i> around here?

192
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:46,620
Mmm-mmm.

193
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,921
- You remember that movie?
- I don't.

194
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,859
- Well, you've seen it.
- Look at those lips.

195
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:55,227
You like it?
You don't think it's too pink?

196
00:15:55,294 --> 00:15:57,863
- Mmm-mmm. I wanna lick them.
- Okay, chill.

197
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,566
- Yo, yo...
- My bad. My bad.

198
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,702
Take care of your own shit.

199
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:40,374
<i>So, we get to Florida</i>

200
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:42,607
<i>and show up
at this nasty motel.</i>

201
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:44,209
Don't worry
about the smell.

202
00:16:44,276 --> 00:16:46,078
Ain't nothing a little
air freshener can't handle.

203
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:50,448
We gonna be
at the club all night.

204
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:53,886
This room for Derrek.
Do not trip.

205
00:16:53,953 --> 00:16:55,654
Don't trip.

206
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:59,826
Yo. Yo, I'm not trying
to stay here, for real.

207
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,428
Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:05,264
I don't wanna see your face
like that.

209
00:17:05,331 --> 00:17:08,801
You only gotta be here till they
get done with what they gotta do.

210
00:17:08,868 --> 00:17:10,937
Our room's not ready.
What can I do?

211
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,805
I'm not a hotel.
I can't make it ready.

212
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:14,940
- I got that.
- It don't make any sense

213
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,508
putting a bunch of money
into a room

214
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:18,810
you gonna be in all alone.

215
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:21,881
You're not gonna like that.
So...

216
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:24,884
We save money today...

217
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:28,287
What?

218
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:33,025
...and get to the pool
and the pina coladas tomorrow.

219
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:35,961
<i>Exactamente.</i> Yeah, um...

220
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:38,198
But can I just come
with you guys to the club?

221
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,100
Nigga, what did
I just tell you?

222
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,902
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

223
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:45,405
It's not so bad, is it?

224
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,609
Yo, it kinda is.

225
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,447
We'll be back soon.

226
00:17:58,551 --> 00:17:59,986
Whose is that?

227
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:01,955
Yours.

228
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,190
And whose is this?

229
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:06,759
Mine.

230
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,698
Mmm.

231
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,740
Gonna make me throw up.

232
00:18:25,477 --> 00:18:27,413
Yo, I'm hungry.

233
00:18:28,614 --> 00:18:31,016
You need all your bags?
Which one you really need?

234
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:32,419
Just this one.

235
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:33,553
Okay, I'll leave this one
right here, a'ight?

236
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:34,688
Watch them bags for us,

237
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,121
- A'ight.

238
00:18:36,188 --> 00:18:38,525

239
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:40,360
He's gonna watch 'em.
Watch them bags, a'ight?

Yeah, I got it.

00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:52,938
Yo, yo. Yo.

247
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:55,508
Yo.

248
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,544
Girl, I don't know.

249
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:01,080
This place feels like
it got roaches.

250
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:03,515
I told you we good.

251
00:19:03,582 --> 00:19:04,851
Okay,

252
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,821
You ask a lot of questions.

253
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:54,400
Dear Heavenly Father,
we come to you thanking you today

254
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:57,570
for all the bounties that you

255
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:01,940
Now, heavenly father,
we are asking you a special prayer today.

256
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:04,076

00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:27,800
Oh, Jesus, you know
if he got good credit, Lord,

267
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,869
I know you sending him
with a big dick.

268
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,670
Don't send us
no no-dick niggas!

269
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:33,640
Send us with a big dick,
Jesus!

270
00:20:33,706 --> 00:20:36,476
Father, we are asking you
humbly today

271
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:38,644

272

Oh, Jesus,

00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,720
Lord Jesus! Oh, I feel it.

He moving. He moving.

Please, Father, Son,

278
00:20:56,329 --> 00:20:58,665
- Amen!

279
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:01,734

00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:03,503
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you.

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,771
Got the spirit in here.

282
00:21:04,838 --> 00:21:06,372

283
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:07,939
Hey, boo.

284
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:10,409
- Ooh, did you feel the spirit?

285
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:13,111
Jesus Christ.
Whoo!

286
00:21:13,178 --> 00:21:14,380
Thank you, Lord.

287
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:16,681

288
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:18,817
Who you gonna

289
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:42,708
Who you gonna

290
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:00,693
- You need these.
- For who?

291
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,227
This a pasties

Not tonight.

297
00:22:10,902 --> 00:22:12,971
You need a permit in Florida
for anything else.

298
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,073
Girl, how we supposed
to make shit in these?

You a sexy bitch.

I'm a sexy bitch.
We gonna make money.

Let's take a pic real quick.

304
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:30,689
<i>From here on out,

305
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,061
- Oh, shit.
- Wait, hold on.

306
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:37,396
Wait, I don't look good
in that light.

307
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:38,999
Ah!

308
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,403
- Yeah, this lighting... Okay?
- You.

309
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:25,737
You look
a lot like Whoopi Goldberg.

310
00:24:38,951 --> 00:24:40,385

<i>If you don't,
I ain't your friend.</i>

318
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,478
Where you been, bitch?

319
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:06,946
Here, bitch.

320
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:08,481
The manager wanted me
to tell you

321
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,749
that there's a dude here that
wants you to do a private.

322
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,785
- Pass.
- He used to play football.

323
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:15,487
Pass.

324
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,791
Tell your boy
I'm ready to go.

325
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,659
Hold it. We look cute.

326
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:25,063
- Let's take a pic.
- We cute. We fine.

327
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,566
Ah! Money. Titties.

328
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,000
Money. Titties.

329
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:32,504
Hey! Damn! That's enough!

330
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,140
- All up in my face.
- Cute.

331
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:36,476
I'm gonna send these to X.

332
00:25:37,243 --> 00:25:38,645
Why?

333
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,779
'Cause we cute.

334
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:44,182
Okay, what's the deal
with your boy, your roommate?

335
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:48,254
We cool.

336
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,229
Well, he used
to take care of me.

337
00:25:56,294 --> 00:26:00,332
<i>Mmm, "take care of me" in
stripper language means he is her pimp.</i>

338
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:03,101
<i>I am not here for that.</i>

339
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,539
He just take care of me,
that's all.

340
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,942
Okay. Too vague.

341
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:12,978
He'll be here in 30.

342
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:18,884
Girl.

343
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:27,125
I can take that one, too.

344
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:30,863
Be right back.

345
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:39,672
- Hey, bitch.
- Hey.

346
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:42,207
My friend just told me there's
a spot we could go dancing,

347
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:44,509
but you gotta
do private dances.

348
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,880
- Pass.
- Why? How much money you make?

349
00:26:47,947 --> 00:26:51,016
- Why?
- Well, 'cause he gonna ask.

350
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,951
Ask what?

351
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:54,720
You'll see.

352
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:56,088
We'll see.

353
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,528
Nope.

354
00:27:02,594 --> 00:27:03,996
What y'all make?

355
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:05,430
Nothing.

356
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:08,534
My other girl
had a bad night, too.

357
00:27:08,601 --> 00:27:09,968
Y'all wanna trap?

358
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:11,070
What you got for us?

359
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:13,239
I set y'all both up on Backpage.

360
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:15,842
<i>Backpage is where
you buy and sell sex.</i>

361
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:17,109
<i>Bitch, strike two.</i>

362
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:20,111
Ooh. Good looking out.

363
00:27:20,178 --> 00:27:22,114
Yous about to get you some.

364
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:27,219
You know I gotcha, girl.

365
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,388
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, hold up.

366
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:32,225
These are pictures we just
took in the dressing room.

367
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:37,095
- Okay, look, I get it.
- Trust.

368
00:27:37,161 --> 00:27:40,164
I am not the one.
Get your coins, sis.

369
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:41,700
It's been real. I'm out.

370
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:44,370
Hey!
Shut the fucking door, bitch!

371
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:45,871
Where the fuck
you from, nigga?

372
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:48,439
Nigga, where the fuck
you from?

373
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,476
Get your ass
back in this car

374
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:53,079
before I put your ass
back in this car!

375
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,628
I picked you up at your house.
I know where you live.

376
00:28:08,694 --> 00:28:11,297
I know where you work.

377
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:15,500
Next time you fix up
your mouth to talk to me,

378
00:28:15,566 --> 00:28:17,569
remember that.

379
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:21,573
Close my fucking door.

380
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:26,044
Bitch.

381
00:28:26,111 --> 00:28:28,180
Put your seat belt on.

382
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:47,967
I got you...

383
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:52,638
I got
you girls a real nice spot.

384
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:54,206
It's on
the other side of town.

385
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:20,392
Ah...

386
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:27,765
Hey, you invited this bitch
down here.

387
00:30:27,832 --> 00:30:28,834
Show her what's up.

388
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:33,706
You got this, all right?

389
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:47,285
Bitch, you got me fucked up!

390
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:51,657
You have me out here thinking
we was coming to dance in Tampa.

391
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,327
But the okey-doke was
your bum-ass thought I was

392
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:57,295
one of these hos out here
poppin' pussy for pennies?

393
00:30:57,361 --> 00:31:01,833
While I bide my time to make the
real money ass up, face down.

394
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,437
Girl... Listen.

395
00:31:05,204 --> 00:31:07,906
No shade, no shame, do you.

396
00:31:07,973 --> 00:31:11,377
But that is not what you told
me I was coming out here to do!

397
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,079
You gonna hit me?

398
00:31:13,144 --> 00:31:15,112
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

399
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,850
This is messy! You are messy!

400
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:20,319
Your brain is broke!

401
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:24,790
Have fun, be safe,
wear condoms.

402
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,829
Zola.

403
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:32,197
Please!

404
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:38,803
I didn't mean to bring you
into this, like...

405
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:42,041
I swear on my life.
I swear on my momma's life.

406
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,876
You're my friend.

407
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:47,278
I didn't know it was gonna
go down like this.

408
00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:49,647
I'm scared.
I don't wanna be alone.

409
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:53,351
He know where I live.
He know where my baby live.

410
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:56,487
Look, I took this trip
for my baby.

411
00:31:56,554 --> 00:31:58,924
I do everything
for my baby.

412
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:09,701
Yo, cookie, it's Derrek.

413
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:12,804
Obviously. Um...

414
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,340
I'm just trying
to see what's up

415
00:32:15,407 --> 00:32:19,111
and how it's all going.
And, uh...

416
00:32:19,177 --> 00:32:22,281
'Cause I haven't heard from
you, so I'm, like, a little

417
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:25,617
worried and shit,
like, uh...

418
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:28,620
I'm thinking about stepping
out and get some food.

419
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:30,957
So, are you trying to eat?

420
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:37,396
Uh, 'cause I can wait,
or, um...

421
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:41,432
I can, uh, go.
All right.

422
00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:44,702
So let me know. All right,
call me back. Okay, bye.

423
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:47,573
<i>Nothing
has been recorded.</i>

424
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,074
All you gotta do
is check them in.

425
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,609
He ain't gonna force you
to trap.

426
00:32:50,676 --> 00:32:53,012
Oh, bitch, I know he's not.

427
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,014
There's a guy on his way up.

428
00:32:56,081 --> 00:32:59,751
I'ma stay here till I can get my
bag from that nasty-ass motel.

429
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:01,018
Okay.

430
00:33:01,954 --> 00:33:04,556
- What do I have to do?
- Just be nice.

431
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:08,026
Say hello. Make them feel welcome.

432
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:12,765
- You like?
- No.

433
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,775
Whatcha doing? Let him in.

434
00:33:23,676 --> 00:33:27,013
Okay! Damn!

435
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,425
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

436
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:42,428
I ordered a white chick.

437
00:33:45,698 --> 00:33:47,800
- Hello!
- Motherfucker, if you don't get your hand up out my face...

438
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:50,535
He ready. He ready.

439
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:51,903
Hello.

440
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:59,044
How old are you?

441
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:01,646
Old enough.

442
00:34:17,628 --> 00:34:19,497
I brought you something.

443
00:34:29,374 --> 00:34:30,575
Cute.

444
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:09,073
<i>They start fucking.
It was gross.</i>

445
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,610
Anyway, I had to lead
the trap home.

446
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:14,612
Bummed, but then
those girls just left, too.

447
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,416
- The Puerto Rican?
- The Dominican.

448
00:36:17,483 --> 00:36:18,784
Her gag reflex...

449
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:21,652
Hey, say, say, say.
You got a lighter?

450
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,088
Yo, what's up?

451
00:36:23,155 --> 00:36:24,523
You got a lighter?

452
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:27,892
Nah. No, no.
There should be somebody...

453
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:30,461
I mean, it's all good, man.
We just chilling.

454
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:31,496
You go on then.

455
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:44,543
- $150.
- Thank you.

456
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:54,919
Pardon?

457
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:58,823
That guy just gave you $150.

458
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,124
Yeah?

459
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:02,394
Twenty minutes on the pole
is damn near 150.

460
00:37:02,459 --> 00:37:04,228
On a good night.

461
00:37:04,296 --> 00:37:05,964
Pussy is worth thousands, bitch!

462
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,233
- I don't set the price.
- Uh-uh, give me your phone.

463
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,503
- Why?
- Hand me your phone.

464
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:12,905
My feet.

465
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,710
Where's the...

466
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,413
Okay, no. No.

467
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:26,251
What is this? Who likes this?
Come on, girl.

468
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,055
If a nigga like the photo,
he don't care about the price.

469
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:31,155
Stand up.

470
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,329
Okay. Yes.

471
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:39,865
Keep moving. Pop. Yes.

472
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,269
No teeth.
She don't need teeth.

473
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:47,305
I use too much teeth
when I suck dick, sis.

474
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:48,941
That's facts.

475
00:37:52,644 --> 00:37:55,014
Trap phone. Put it in.

476
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:00,753
Who you doing this for?

477
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:05,758
- My baby?
- Right. Keep that same energy.

478
00:38:08,126 --> 00:38:09,995
Five hundred a pop.

479
00:38:10,061 --> 00:38:12,163
- That's too much!
- It's not.

480
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,945
Mmm-hmm.

481
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:29,880
Nigga on his way up here
right now.

482
00:38:29,947 --> 00:38:32,316
$500 for 15 minutes of pussy.

483
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:36,721
- Okay, bitch.
- Okay, girl.

484
00:38:36,787 --> 00:38:39,891
- Okay, girl. Okay, B.
- Okay, B.

485
00:38:57,575 --> 00:38:59,177
What's poppin', my guy?

486
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:02,213
Nothin'. What's up with you?

487
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,949
Oh, shit.
Ain't nothing to it, man.

488
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,119
Didn't I see you earlier?

489
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:12,724
Across the street
at the motel, man.

490
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:14,892
Yeah, yeah.

491
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,427
Yeah. Thought so, thought so,
thought so.

492
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:17,928
I think I saw you there.

493
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:20,465
Yeah, you was
with them two chicks.

494
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:23,068
Pretty-ass girls,
with all their bags.

495
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:24,969
The Black one
with the fat ass?

496
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,037
Yeah.

497
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:27,672
- That ass special, right?
- It's a fat ass.

498
00:39:27,738 --> 00:39:29,073
- Right?
- Oh, yeah. For sure.

499
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,209
And the white girl
with the pretty face.

500
00:39:31,276 --> 00:39:32,578
That's my girlfriend.

501
00:39:32,644 --> 00:39:34,611
- Okay, cool. All right.
- Yeah.

502
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:36,847
All right,
what brings y'all here?

503
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:41,285
- Making sh'money.
- Making that sh'money.

504
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:43,922
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Facts.

505
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:46,925
Always a good thing to party.

506
00:39:46,992 --> 00:39:50,093
Cash it in.
Cash up.

507
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,965
Right. So, it's your first time in
Tampa, though, right?

508
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,231
It is.

509
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:56,367
So you gotta let me
show you around!

510
00:39:57,668 --> 00:40:00,138
- Yeah?
- Fucking right. It's my city.

511
00:40:00,204 --> 00:40:01,439
I'm down.

512
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:04,977
Hell, yeah, you gonna love
this motherfucker. For real.

513
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:06,878
Get a pack of Black &
Milds and we can roll.

514
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:09,414
Hey, I'm down
for the B&M.

515
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,697
<i>Yo...</i>

516
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:27,066
Text me back.

517
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:29,400
I'm worried about you.

518
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,302
I wanna know that you're okay.

519
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,805
I haven't heard from you
since you left. You a'ight?

520
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:35,841
Five stars.

521
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:41,813
- The club was lit.
- I miss you. I love you.

522
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,148
- I can barely...
- Heart emoji. Heart emoji.

523
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:48,052
- ...keep my eyes open.
- Rose emoji. Rose emoji.

524
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,790
IDK. LOL.

525
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,991
I love you.

526
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:56,228
I miss you.

527
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,364
XOXO.

528
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:02,426
Oh, yes.
Oh, tell me you love me.

529
00:42:02,494 --> 00:42:05,063
Oh, tell me you love me.

530
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:02,955
<i>Hey.</i>

531
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:06,023
Yo, where the fuck are you?

532
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,758
You know, I've been calling you all night.

533
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:09,760
I don't think
my phone's working.

534
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:11,294
<i>To be honest with you,
the service down here is trash.</i>

535
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:14,264
Yo, the club closed
three hours ago!

536
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:15,766
<i>Well, we went
to a different club.</i>

537
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,135
What club?

538
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,136
Look up
for 24-hour clubs.

539
00:43:18,202 --> 00:43:20,304
<i>What's the name of the spot?</i>

540
00:43:20,372 --> 00:43:22,107
<i>It's the one that's right by
that McDonald's that I told you about.</i>

541
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:23,541
Didn't I tell you?

542
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:25,042
- <i>No, you didn't.</i>
- Ding Dong.

543
00:43:25,108 --> 00:43:26,377
- <i>Ding Dong.</i>
- Ding Dongs?

544
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:27,745
- <i>Yeah, Ding Dongs.</i>
- That's not a spot.

545
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:29,112
I'm not fucking lying to you!

546
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,015
Look it up!
It's right by McDonald's.

547
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:32,517
If you went home with a dude
tonight, I'mma kill you.

548
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,486
I swear to God. I swear.

549
00:43:34,552 --> 00:43:36,954
I just told you where I'm at!
Why are you trippin'?

550
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:38,423
<i>I'm not trippin'. Put Zola on.</i>

551
00:43:38,488 --> 00:43:40,090
- Okay, she right here.
- Mmm-mmm.

552
00:43:40,157 --> 00:43:41,492
<i>Talk to him.</i>

553
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:43,495
<i>Derrek.</i>

554
00:43:43,561 --> 00:43:46,030
Yo, Zola. What's up, Zola?

555
00:43:46,097 --> 00:43:47,331
<i>Where the fuck are you, Zola?</i>

556
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:48,633
My dude...

557
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,201
I have no reason
to lie to you,

558
00:43:50,267 --> 00:43:52,602
but if you do wanna continue
to come for me side...

559
00:43:53,905 --> 00:43:55,173
Bitch is lyin', bro!
I'm telling you,

560
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,608
I'm not gonna let her
play you, bro!

561
00:43:56,673 --> 00:43:58,108
I'm fucking done with this!
I'm done with this.

562
00:43:58,175 --> 00:43:59,709
- I'm done with this.
- Man, listen...

563
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,612
I feel bad for you, bro.
That shit fucked up, bro.

564
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,815
I feel bad for you.

565
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:55,032
Hey, hey, hey.

566
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,336
You been here long?

567
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,138
A hour.

568
00:45:01,305 --> 00:45:02,874
How much y'all make?

569
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,142
$8,000.

570
00:45:06,644 --> 00:45:08,379
What?

571
00:45:08,445 --> 00:45:11,782
Get the fuck out of here.

572
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:14,251
Get the fuck
out of here, girl. What?

573
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,921
Oh, my God! Oh, shit!

574
00:45:17,988 --> 00:45:19,023
Damn! Damn!

575
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,026
That's all from me.

576
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,635
Well, Zola made me
a whole new page.

577
00:45:37,008 --> 00:45:39,644
So, um... Wait.

578
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,413
You think you can do my job
better than me?

579
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:44,582
<i>Yup.</i>

580
00:45:48,653 --> 00:45:51,756
So, y'all trying to tell me
that y'all made eight grand

581
00:45:51,822 --> 00:45:53,991
just fucking in one night?

582
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,794
And this bitch didn't fuck.

583
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:08,340
Get the fuck outta here.
God damn.

584
00:46:08,407 --> 00:46:11,410
Fuck, bitch, you earned it.

585
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:16,414
I'm so proud of you.
You did good.

586
00:46:22,753 --> 00:46:24,488
What? What?

587
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,794
Can I get some, too?

588
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,596
Can you get some, too?
Get the fuck outta here.

589
00:46:33,697 --> 00:46:35,499
You got clothes
on your back, right?

590
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:37,468
You got food in your belly?

591
00:46:39,204 --> 00:46:42,173
Who put tracks in your fucking
hair, your fucking nails and shit?

592
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,508
What the fuck you think,
shit cost is free?

593
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:46,443
You eat, right?
You get gas for the car.

594
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,912
None of this shit.
is cheap.

595
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:52,015
Stop trippin'. Don't let that bitch
get into your head, all right?

596
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:53,218
Stay smart.

597
00:46:53,285 --> 00:46:55,787
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go, go!

598
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,160
Derrek, wake the fuck up, bro!

599
00:47:04,229 --> 00:47:06,531
Derrek.

600
00:47:06,597 --> 00:47:09,166
...stay here.
All I wanna see is more magic.

601
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:11,369
I got tricks for days,
believe me.

602
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:12,970
Dude, you're nuts, bro.

603
00:47:13,037 --> 00:47:16,374
I'm, like, freakin' out! Yo!

604
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:19,044
- Hey, you wanna meet her?
- Another time.

605
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,711
- Meet my girl.
- Holla at you later, man.

606
00:47:20,778 --> 00:47:23,814
- Who the fuck was that?
- That's my friend.

607
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:25,249
- What's your friend name?
- Uh...

608
00:47:25,316 --> 00:47:26,685
You don't know
your friend name, no!

609
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:28,151
- I don't remember.
- Hey! What, what, what?

610
00:47:28,218 --> 00:47:29,753
He saw us when we...

611
00:47:30,555 --> 00:47:32,991
- And he said, uh...
- Come, come, come!

612
00:47:33,057 --> 00:47:34,892
...that my girl's
going to work,

613
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,227
which she is doing.

614
00:47:36,293 --> 00:47:38,762
And then he said,
"I saw the car come up."

615
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:41,098
I was like, "That's pretty...
That's the story, dude."

616
00:47:49,773 --> 00:47:52,776
Where the fuck
you tell him your girl work?

617
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:56,179
Yo, yo, yo. I said...
I said it's just some club.

618
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:57,648
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:47:57,715 --> 00:47:59,883
So now this nigga know
we got money in here!

620
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:02,654
We... We don't got money.

621
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,755
Baby?

622
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,223
That nigga
could come back here

623
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,660
with a whole crew,
and slit our throats!

624
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:09,961
What?

625
00:48:10,028 --> 00:48:11,796
Hey! Get your bags! Let's go!
We're leaving!

626
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,903
Let's go, everybody.
Let's go!

627
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:08,820
Look me in the eyes and
tell me what you were doing.

628
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:10,688
Look me in the eyes and
tell me what you were doing!

629
00:49:10,755 --> 00:49:12,390
Tell me!

630
00:49:37,247 --> 00:49:39,182
Hey, you're in charge.

631
00:49:39,249 --> 00:49:40,517
Watch Derrek.

632
00:49:40,584 --> 00:49:42,452
Oh, is this
my "look-out" promotion?

633
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:45,456
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
this is your promotion.

634
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:49,126
Hey! Mama! Hey!

635
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:03,974
Why you looking at me
like that?

636
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,416
I thought
you were gonna stop.

637
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:14,318
You said
you were gonna stop.

638
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,254
I'm not...

639
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,856
I'm not playing.

640
00:50:21,224 --> 00:50:23,360
Ah, don't touch me.

641
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:28,498
I can smell
other dudes on you!

642
00:50:28,566 --> 00:50:30,435
No!

643
00:50:32,602 --> 00:50:35,340
Whose is that?

644
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:41,746
It's yours.

645
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:44,615
And whose is this?

646
00:50:47,117 --> 00:50:48,518
Mine.

647
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:50,621
<i>They start fucking.
It was gross.</i>

648
00:51:15,378 --> 00:51:17,047
I got you something.

649
00:51:21,418 --> 00:51:24,421
Hey, hey, hey, look inside.

650
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:29,627
What's this for?

651
00:51:30,227 --> 00:51:31,528
Respect.

652
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:34,364
- So, I can go home now?
- Nah.

653
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:36,867
I'mma need you to do
what you did last night.

654
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:41,839
I appreciate your confidence
in me, but I came to dance.

655
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:44,108
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're done with that.

656
00:51:44,175 --> 00:51:47,044
Oh, well, in that case,
I'ma sit my ass right here

657
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,047
and, if you don't mind,
you in my sunlight, nigga.

658
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:53,084
I'm in your sunlight, nigga?

659
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,053
Nigga, watch your mouth
before you speak to me!

660
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:57,588
Watch it!

661
00:51:57,655 --> 00:52:00,858
- Miss, may I, uh, help you?
- She don't need any help.

662
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:01,691
Miss?

663
00:52:01,758 --> 00:52:03,827
She doesn't need any help.

664
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:05,763
I'm good.

665
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:08,966
- She's good.
- Mmm-hmm.

666
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,177
Now, when I stand,
you stand.

667
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:24,215
And when I walk,

668
00:52:24,282 --> 00:52:26,450
you motherfucking walk.

669
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:28,453
Got it?

670
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:40,264
By all means,
take your fucking time.

671
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:41,832
I got all goddamn day.

672
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,168
Jesus Christ.

673
00:52:51,474 --> 00:52:53,043
Mmm!

674
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:03,086
Yo, I gotta talk to you.

675
00:53:03,153 --> 00:53:04,487
Can you come with me
to the bathroom?

676
00:53:04,555 --> 00:53:07,191
Babe, you should take a walk.

677
00:53:07,258 --> 00:53:09,526
Cookie, I don't wanna walk.

678
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:16,266
Yo. Yo, yo, yo.
Yo. Yo, yo, yo. Yo.

679
00:53:16,334 --> 00:53:17,768
I thought
you were done with this.

680
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:21,538
I didn't come
to Florida for this!

681
00:53:22,773 --> 00:53:24,140
Is this what
you came here for, Zola?

682
00:53:24,207 --> 00:53:25,943
Do it look like
I came here for this?

683
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,713
Oh, so you set up a friend!
Again!

684
00:53:28,778 --> 00:53:31,916
<i>Let me find out this
bitch done did this before.</i>

685
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:34,318
Don't listen to anything
he say, Zola.

686
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:36,254
I told you he crazy.

687
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,122
I'm not crazy... Yo!

688
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,703
I don't fuck with you.
I don't like you.

689
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:54,972
I didn't do
anything wrong.

690
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,573
Bitch, how many
other girls were there?

691
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:58,107
I told you,
he bipolar.

692
00:53:58,175 --> 00:54:01,178
Run in his family.
He basically has no dick.

693
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:03,747
Okay. Cool.

694
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:07,885
Everybody knows
you're a ho now!

695
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:11,722
Everybody knows
you're a ho now.

696
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:14,959
I should've known you
was shit when I met you.

697
00:54:15,026 --> 00:54:16,861
<i>Derrek shows her
his phone.</i>

698
00:54:16,927 --> 00:54:18,395
<i>On it, is her Facebook.</i>

699

<i>He posts the status

<i>and her mom is on there
going off in the comments.</i>

701
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:24,702
Why would you do that?

702
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:26,104
You know my whole
family's on there!

703
00:54:26,169 --> 00:54:27,238
I'm trying to help you!

704
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,806
Don't say shit to me!

705
00:54:28,872 --> 00:54:31,342
- I'm trying to save you!
- I ain't trying to be saved!

706
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:33,544
Yo! Stefani!

<i>It'll be 24 hours
till I hear this bitch voice.</i>

You put that shit up
on the Internet?

709
00:54:43,454 --> 00:54:44,923
I did.

710
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,994
I really should
kill your ass.

711
00:54:51,061 --> 00:54:52,430
Lord!

712
00:54:52,496 --> 00:54:54,264
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Tell them you sorry.

713
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:55,698
Hey, man! Come on, man!

714
00:54:55,765 --> 00:54:57,302
Man, what's my name?
Say my name. Say my name.

715
00:55:01,338 --> 00:55:03,541
Say it. Say it. Say it!

716

718
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:08,446
Hey!

719
00:55:08,512 --> 00:55:11,314
Abegunde Olawale.

720
00:55:11,381 --> 00:55:13,084
Delete the post.

721
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:23,194
Sit the fuck down.

722
00:55:31,535 --> 00:55:33,004
Whose is that?

723
00:55:33,738 --> 00:55:35,339
Yours.

724
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:37,976
- Whose is that?
- Yours.

725
00:55:38,642 --> 00:55:41,044
- Whose is that?
- Yours.

726
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,112
Ah.

727
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:48,086
You better fucking not.

728
00:55:48,151 --> 00:55:49,787
I swear to God.

729
00:55:49,854 --> 00:55:51,622
Oh, you mother...

730
00:56:04,968 --> 00:56:07,637
Tomorrow,
gonna get some of that Versace.

731
00:56:07,704 --> 00:56:09,840
- Yeah? Mmm-hmm?
- You like that, baby?

732
00:56:09,907 --> 00:56:11,909
And I'm gonna get you
some Tiffany earrings.

733
00:56:12,508 --> 00:56:13,744
You like Tiffany, right?

734
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:15,446
I like a Gucci dress.

735
00:56:15,512 --> 00:56:16,913
You like Gucci dresses, right?

736
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,881
<i>Oh, no, I'm stuck!</i>

737
00:59:40,617 --> 00:59:42,652
I just...

738
00:59:42,718 --> 00:59:44,621
You tried it.
I'm done.

739
00:59:47,892 --> 00:59:50,961
- Okay.
- What does that mean?

740
00:59:51,028 --> 00:59:53,064
It means,
okay, I'm done.

741
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:13,517
Hey, Mom.

742
01:00:14,117 --> 01:00:16,986
Yeah, I saw that. Um...

743
01:00:17,053 --> 01:00:18,856
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

744
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,389
Can I call you back?

745
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:24,527
Yo!

746
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,064
Yo, look.

747
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:33,869
- What the fuck?
- I've seen this one.

748
01:00:33,936 --> 01:00:35,505
Yo!

749
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:40,110
What the fuck?

750
01:00:43,146 --> 01:00:46,583
- This dude's crazy!
- He is.

751
01:00:47,785 --> 01:00:50,053
Yo, I'ma make movies
like this.

752
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:52,222
- Word.
- I swear.

753
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:57,727
You could make a lot of money
making movies like this.

754
01:00:57,794 --> 01:00:59,162
Right.

755
01:01:01,097 --> 01:01:03,467
<i>Holy shit!</i>

I'm sorry, yo.

758
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:20,651
I'm just trying to distract my brain, you know?

759
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:25,555
Like, that's my best friend.

760
01:01:26,722 --> 01:01:28,224
She just, uh...

761
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,162
Like, I'd do anything for her,
you know?

762
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:37,633
I... I'd give her a lung...

763
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:41,338
Not a heart. Uh...

764
01:01:43,106 --> 01:01:45,343
A kidney, like, whatever.

765
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:48,711
- If she...
- Were you homeschooled?

766
01:01:48,778 --> 01:01:52,349
Why?
You think I'm stupid?

767
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:57,488
- I look stupid.
- What do I look like?

768
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,467
I'm sorry, Zola.

769
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:53,309
<i>Oye,</i> bro, <i>mandaron dos!</i>

770
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:17,166
Your man said
it was 200 each for head,

771
01:03:17,233 --> 01:03:19,501
400 each for a gang bang.

772
01:03:19,568 --> 01:03:22,505
- He never said that.
- No, he said that.

773
01:03:22,572 --> 01:03:25,508
- When you talk to him?
- Before.

774
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:32,048
I don't set the price.

775
01:03:32,115 --> 01:03:33,650
You know what,
I'm actually good

776
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:35,852
on the gang bang, okay?
I'm easy.

777
01:03:35,918 --> 01:03:38,421
I'm fine with some head.

778
01:03:39,256 --> 01:03:40,857
Yo, I was hoping
I could get butt.

779
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:42,057
She don't do that.

780
01:03:43,494 --> 01:03:46,229
- We savages, miss.
- We ain't proper.

781
01:03:46,296 --> 01:03:48,198
Look, you know what,
I'm good...

782
01:04:46,322 --> 01:04:47,456
Y'all wanna hear a story

783
01:04:47,523 --> 01:04:48,758
about why me
and this bitch fell out?

784
01:04:48,825 --> 01:04:51,327
It's long,
but I'ma speed it up.

785
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:01,604
And action.

786
01:05:01,671 --> 01:05:05,376
We meet at the restaurant
she work at.

787
01:05:05,441 --> 01:05:08,277
I was with
my community leader, Jonathan.

788
01:05:08,345 --> 01:05:13,015
This very ratchet
and very Black woman

789
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:15,151
comes to take our order.

790
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:18,288
And listen, I know that they supposed
to be flirtatious and everything,

791
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:19,956
<i>but not like she was.</i>

792
01:05:20,023 --> 01:05:22,792
I'm a Christian. I fear God.

793
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,861
<i>So we exchanged numbers.</i>

794
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:28,297
The next day, she called me
and she's like,

795
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:32,102
"I'm a ex dancer. I'm broke.
I need welfare."

796
01:05:32,168 --> 01:05:34,037
And I told her, I don't fuck
with that life no more,

797
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:35,972
and she's like,
"Well, who do you fuck with?"

798
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:39,410
I was like, "I fuck with
Jesus, my Lord and savior."

799
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:45,482
I told her that my good
friend Abegunde Olawale,

800
01:05:45,548 --> 01:05:46,782
who a promoter in Tampa,

801
01:05:46,849 --> 01:05:49,552
had invited me
and my boyfriend to Tampa

802
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:51,321
to be his guests
for the weekend.

803
01:05:51,387 --> 01:05:52,822
And she was like,

804
01:05:52,889 --> 01:05:55,325
"Let me dance at the club
he promote at."

805
01:05:55,392 --> 01:05:57,194
And I was like,
"Is that how that works?

806
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:58,762
"'Cause I don't know
how that work."

807
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:05,202
In Tampa, the club don't let
her dance 'cause she dirty.

808
01:06:05,269 --> 01:06:07,638
But everybody loved me.

809
01:06:07,704 --> 01:06:10,673
Reason to be a jealous bitch
number one.

810
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,676
So she takes
all these pictures

811
01:06:12,742 --> 01:06:15,445
and she pops off
a Backpage ad.

812
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:19,850
<i>And I was like, "Backpage ad?"
Like, what is that?</i>

813
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:22,285
At the hotel,
I stay with her

814
01:06:22,352 --> 01:06:25,055
because I'm worried
about her safety.

815
01:06:25,122 --> 01:06:26,857
She wasn't getting any calls,

816
01:06:26,923 --> 01:06:31,059
so she puts my picture up with her
picture, and she ain't even ask.

817
01:06:31,126 --> 01:06:32,895
I was very put off.

818
01:06:33,764 --> 01:06:35,365
Nobody liked her.

819
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:37,968
She made $1.

820
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:40,936
Everybody loved me.

821
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:45,676
Reason to be
a jealous bitch number two.

822
01:07:25,981 --> 01:07:29,686
I'm not resisting you.
I just wanna go home.

823
01:07:31,354 --> 01:07:33,723
I'm not fighting!

824
01:07:33,789 --> 01:07:35,425
I'm not fighting!

825
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:37,459
Stop fighting
and get on the ground!

826
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:39,295
I can't! I can't!

827
01:07:39,361 --> 01:07:40,697
- Fucking nigger!
- I can't!

828
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:43,133
I can't! I can't!

829
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,467
I just wanna go home!

830
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:46,302
Put your hands
behind your back!

831
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:47,903
Help! Help!

832
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,773
Put your hands
behind your back!

833
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:53,610
Put your hands
behind your back!

834
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:57,613
Help me! Help! Help!

835
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,081
<i>$5,000
for two bitches.</i>

836
01:09:05,147 --> 01:09:06,849
<i>Client wants two.</i>

837
01:09:08,217 --> 01:09:10,120
<i>$2,000 for one.</i>

838
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,622
<i>Last one.</i>

839
01:09:18,094 --> 01:09:20,497
- You cold?
- A little.

840
01:09:21,397 --> 01:09:24,168
Let's just go.
You don't gotta do this.

841
01:09:24,233 --> 01:09:25,767
You got a little money
on you right now.

842
01:09:25,835 --> 01:09:27,704
You can stretch that out.

843
01:09:35,311 --> 01:09:36,545
Who is it?

844
01:09:36,612 --> 01:09:38,115
In-call.

845
01:09:43,253 --> 01:09:44,521
Shut the fuck up,
bitch!

846
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:26,396
All right. Take the car
and go home, all right?

847
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:28,398
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

848
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:30,099
You know I'd kill
for you, right?

849
01:10:30,166 --> 01:10:31,602
Yeah, I know you would.

850
01:10:35,304 --> 01:10:37,874
- We gotta call the cops.
- No, we go up and we get her.

851
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:39,209
- We got nothing to do with this shit!
- Yes!

852
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,744
- Let's go!
- Oh, we don't? How the fuck

853
01:10:40,811 --> 01:10:41,777
do I know you ain't in
on this shit?

854
01:10:41,844 --> 01:10:43,647
- I'm not.
- Oh, yeah?

855
01:10:43,713 --> 01:10:45,881
Then how the fuck did you get
out and she got all hemmed up?

856
01:10:45,948 --> 01:10:47,750
You were supposed to be
looking out for her, Zola.

857
01:10:47,817 --> 01:10:50,119
You were supposed to be
looking the fuck out for her!

858
01:10:50,187 --> 01:10:53,055
- Who's looking out for me?
- You still got that piece?

859
01:11:02,464 --> 01:11:03,665
Get over here.

860
01:11:06,803 --> 01:11:08,137
Who is it?

861
01:11:08,204 --> 01:11:09,539
Motherfucker,
you know who this is.

862
01:11:09,606 --> 01:11:11,907
- I want my bitch.
- Which bitch?

863
01:11:11,974 --> 01:11:14,244
- My bitch.
- I been all over Tampa,

864
01:11:14,309 --> 01:11:16,146
and I ain't met a bitch
named "My" yet.

865
01:11:16,211 --> 01:11:18,113
You want me to let you in

866
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:21,151
while you flashing that
fucking gun in my face?

867
01:11:22,485 --> 01:11:23,820
Oh!

868
01:11:23,885 --> 01:11:25,688
<i>Guess who opens
the door?</i>

869
01:11:25,754 --> 01:11:28,757
<i>The nigga Derrek was doing magic
with at that nasty-ass motel.</i>

870
01:11:28,825 --> 01:11:31,428
- Yo, I thought we were homies!
- We not.

871
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:32,696
Strip.

872
01:11:33,929 --> 01:11:35,298
He ain't got shit.

873
01:11:35,365 --> 01:11:37,701
Take your motherfucking
clothes off!

874
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:43,906
- Turn around.
- This isn't you!

875
01:11:45,107 --> 01:11:47,943
Man, put your shit

876
01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:50,746
Come on. Pick your shit up.

879
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:01,858
I ain't trying

880
01:12:01,924 --> 01:12:04,094
You're good, buddy.

01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,496
Those some nice motherfucking
shoes you got on.

882
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:08,129
I'm not gonna lie.

883
01:12:08,196 --> 01:12:10,799
Rattlesnake.
Yeah, a little place.

884
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,101
- Oh, yeah?

885
01:12:12,168 --> 01:12:14,103

887
01:12:24,879 --> 01:12:26,548
A'ight, let's do this.

888
01:12:26,616 --> 01:12:28,018
Relax, okay?

889
01:12:28,085 --> 01:12:31,187
Don't rush
in here, rushing me.

890
01:12:31,254 --> 01:12:33,991
Telling me what to do
and shit. I got this.

891
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:38,261
What's your name?
You got some pretty ass eyes.

892
01:12:38,327 --> 01:12:39,795
No, thank you.

893
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:42,497
Why is this bitch
so bitter, bro?

894
01:12:42,564 --> 01:12:43,633
What did y'all
do to her?

895
01:12:43,698 --> 01:12:44,968
Where is she?

896
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:46,169
- Just give her back!
- Hey. Hey.

897
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:48,671
Don't move that fucking fast
in here.

898
01:12:50,874 --> 01:12:53,443
Look, y'all don't know me,
I don't know y'all,

899
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:56,811

01:12:56,879 --> 01:12:59,783
when niggas is pointing guns

901
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:04,521
God damn it!
Y'all stressing me out!

902
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,389
I'm trying to be
a hospitable host.

903
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:07,957
Brother, I understand.

904
01:13:08,023 --> 01:13:09,325
I don't know how they do shit
where you from,

905
01:13:09,392 --> 01:13:11,327
but where I'm from,

906
01:13:11,393 --> 01:13:14,196
you don't just jump
in another man back yard

907
01:13:14,263 --> 01:13:16,064
and pull your pants down

908
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:19,169
and start pissing and shitting
wherever the fuck you want to.

909
01:13:19,235 --> 01:13:21,170
I get you.

01:13:21,237 --> 01:13:24,408
So, I get 20 grand

911
01:13:24,473 --> 01:13:26,776
and guess what?
All is forgiven.

912
01:13:28,544 --> 01:13:31,281
Twenty grand?
That bitch can pull in

913
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:33,316
20 grand on a weekend
by her goddamn self.

914
01:13:33,383 --> 01:13:35,785
Fact. That's why
she don't belong to you.

915
01:13:35,852 --> 01:13:37,787
Zola, stand up.

916
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:39,921
Zola, stand up.

917
01:13:39,988 --> 01:13:41,256

01:13:43,726 --> 01:13:45,760
Fifty grand.

Fifty grand. Hey.

01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:51,100
Fifty grand. Fifty grand.

922
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:54,970
And you can keep this,

923
01:13:55,037 --> 01:13:58,207
Look at this shit.
Look at this shit.

924
01:14:02,344 --> 01:14:03,946
Now, give it a taste.

925
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:06,182
Taste it.

926
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:08,550
Zola, don't you fucking move.

927
01:14:08,617 --> 01:14:10,320
Taste it.

928
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,594
Yeah, you like that,

929
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:21,731
Yo, put your fingers in.

01:14:22,365 --> 01:14:23,733
Yeah, lick it.

931
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:30,740
Yeah, you like that,
don't you?

932
01:14:30,807 --> 01:14:33,777
Taste it, brother.
There we go.

933
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:36,912
Yeah, man, that's it.
That's it, yeah.

934
01:14:36,979 --> 01:14:38,747
Yeah, I know
you like that, brother.

935
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:40,582
You like that?

936
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,919
Yeah, that shit
smells good, right?

937
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:44,921
Mmm.

938
01:14:47,055 --> 01:14:49,893
- Just like I thought.
- Yeah, that's it.

939
01:14:50,793 --> 01:14:52,795
Better.

940
01:14:52,862 --> 01:14:55,665
Don't cry. Don't cry.

941
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:58,768
Oh, shit.

942
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:00,936
Hey, drop your gun,

943
01:15:01,004 --> 01:15:02,037
and tell your buddy
to drop his gun.

944
01:15:02,104 --> 01:15:03,772
There must be a fucking

945
01:15:03,839 --> 01:15:06,208
grand misunderstanding
going on in this...

946
01:15:06,276 --> 01:15:08,044
It sure fucking is.
Drop your gun.

947
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:10,912
And tell your boy to drop
his motherfucking gun.

948
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:12,816
I'm not fucking playing.

949
01:15:13,482 --> 01:15:15,050
CeeCee.

950
01:15:15,117 --> 01:15:17,152
The fuck, man!

951
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:18,588
Drop that
motherfucking gun.

952
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,289
Get the fuck outta here.

953
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:22,224
Hey, Derrek,

954
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,592
- All right.
- Gimme that.

01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:25,028
Yo, yo! Come here.

956
01:15:25,094 --> 01:15:26,227

958
01:15:28,932 --> 01:15:30,300
You got a Hummer

959
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:32,235
Yeah, that's it.

960
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,835
Hey, man,
I don't even know this man.

961
01:15:33,902 --> 01:15:35,170
I had nothing to do with this.
Nothing.

962
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:38,139
Nigga, really?
My momma just cooked for us!

963
01:15:38,206 --> 01:15:39,843
This nigga ain't even
gonna shoot.

964
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:41,309
- I'm not gonna shoot?
- You know how many niggas

965
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:43,847

this shit before you?

966

01:15:46,715 --> 01:15:47,717
Come on.

968
01:15:48,817 --> 01:15:50,419

Safe travels.

01:17:07,496 --> 01:17:08,898
Hey, hey.

Ah, thank you. Mmm.

01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:23,479
Can I get a kiss?

978
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:44,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Shut the fucking door!

979
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:02,017
- You want bacon?
- No.

980
01:18:07,455 --> 01:18:09,659
Yeah, so, I hate
to break this thing up,

981
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:12,161
but, uh, my time
has come to a close.

982
01:18:20,503 --> 01:18:22,706

Yo, we get to go.

01:18:31,947 --> 01:18:34,351
We're going home.
I can take care of you.

986
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,385
Okay, chill.

987
01:18:36,452 --> 01:18:38,388
Yo, cookie.

That's my face. Those my tits.
That's my ass.

989
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:48,997
Wow.

990
01:18:49,064 --> 01:18:51,968
- It's time to go home, Derrek.
- It's time to go home, Derrek.

991
01:18:52,035 --> 01:18:54,670
No, no, no, no, no!

992
01:18:54,737 --> 01:18:56,272
No! Why?

993
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:01,110

I'm saying, Stefani,
I love you! Do you hear?

997
01:19:08,183 --> 01:19:11,588
Yeah. Why you gotta
be so extra? Like, chill.

998
01:19:11,653 --> 01:19:15,057
- You're fucking stupid.
- Yo, I... I'm serious.

999
01:19:15,124 --> 01:19:17,794
I'm gonna kill myself.

1000
01:19:19,728 --> 01:19:20,896
Yo, I'm gonna kill myself.

1001
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,233
Why you gotta be
so dramatic?

1002
01:19:26,201 --> 01:19:28,504
Swear to God, Bible,

Don't you die, nigga!

Why the fuck

Whole fucking trip

01:20:18,487 --> 01:20:20,289
Tearing up
a fucking motel room!

1008
01:20:20,356 --> 01:20:22,826
Telling that little nigga to
come fucking take my bitch!

1009
01:20:22,892 --> 01:20:24,093
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1010
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:25,760
Girl, you know I love you.

1011
01:20:28,496 --> 01:20:32,200
<i>You wanna hear a story about
how me and this bitch here fell out?</i>

1012
01:20:32,902 --> 01:20:35,438
<i>It's kinda long,
but it's full of suspense.</i>
