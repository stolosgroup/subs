3
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,625
God...

4
00:01:19,958 --> 00:01:21,250
<i>911, what's the address</i>

5
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:22,583
<i>to your emergency?</i>

6
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,958
I-I'd like to report
a domestic dispute

7
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,833
in my apartment building.

8
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,375
<i>And what is
the address to your emergency?</i>

9
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,875
Hold on.

10
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,167
It's 4200 Greenbush Avenue,
a-apartment four.

11
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,792
I can't...

12
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,125
No, no, I can't.

13
00:01:43,708 --> 00:01:45,917
No, I can't stay on the phone.

14
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,500
He's hitting her.

15
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,458
<i>Ladies and gents,
brace yourselves.</i>

16
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:59,125
<i>I have some bad news.</i>

17
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,333
<i>Zac Efron is off the market.</i>

18
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,292
- Who was that?
- Andrea.

19
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,667
You okay?

20
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,083
Did you leave the sliding door open?

21
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:19,917
No.

22
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:24,250
It's a bad habit leaving doors open.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,792
Once the termites get in,
you can never get rid of them.

24
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,208
- Okay?
- Okay.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,833
Everybody just wants to be famous.

26
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:42,750
And for what?

27
00:02:43,542 --> 00:02:47,667
So we can pretend we're famous too...

28
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,583
but it's fucking fake, the whole thing.

29
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,667
Photoshop.

30
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,792
Hell, I could be famous

31
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,542
with these window-shoppers.

32
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,958
Be happy with what you've got.

33
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,083
You too, so easily manipulated.

34
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,458
I'll never understand it.

35
00:03:23,208 --> 00:03:25,208
So I have to talk to you about something.

36
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:34,333
About a month ago, I got a purple letter,

37
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,708
an anonymous letter

38
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:42,708
inviting me to meet
an admirer in a hotel room.

39
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,042
I thought it was stupid.

40
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,167
I thought it might have been...

41
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,917
I don't know what I thought.

42
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,833
But I went, and it was once.

43
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:04,417
And I realized that I've been unhappy.

44
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:08,417
I am unhappy.

45
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,542
I've given you ten fantastic years,

46
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:18,916
years that I'll never regret.

47
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,708
But I'm asking you now to let me leave.

48
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,500
I don't want half of your money.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,792
I think $5,000 is all I'll need
to start again.

50
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,042
I honestly don't know what got
into me, but I'm glad that it did.

51
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,958
Stop that.

52
00:04:56,083 --> 00:05:00,250
I can't justify staying with you anymore
just to be nice.

53
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:51,375
Anything good?

54
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,833
It's a wedding invitation.

55
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,708
Nicer than ours?

56
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,083
Not a chance.

57
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,583
All right.

58
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,417
I was thinking we could
go to the caterer's on Sunday,

59
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,958
try out that new menu.

60
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,083
Oh, yeah, I love it,
that sounds great.

61
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,542
You know, if we don't end up
feeling like seeing

62
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,917
PJ and Lauren tonight,
we can cancel,

63
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,083
it's totally fine.

64
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,500
Oh, okay, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,000
All right,
should I tell him?

66
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,708
- Yes.
- All right fine, it's...

67
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,458
All right.
So for months,

68
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,042
we were trying to get in
touch with the guy's team,

69
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,792
we're trying to sign
the guy to the agency.

70
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,917
{\an8}No answer.
We're doing everything we can,

71
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,875
{\an8}trying to reach the guy's
higher ups, everything.

72
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,750
We're trying every possible
combination of email address,

73
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,417
doesn't work,
nothing, all right?

74
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,750
So I've been reading a lot
about the Medici family.

75
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,333
These guys, they got all
the money in the world,

76
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,958
they're secluded from everybody.

77
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,917
And I was thinking,
and I was like,

78
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,792
these rich people,

79
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,208
they don't have social media.

80
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,667
You can't get in touch with
these people.

81
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,000
They don't have Facebook
or anything.

82
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,500
But you can bet these
motherfuckers have Venmo.

83
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,333
No.

84
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,833
Oh, yeah, bro.

85
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,542
So I send the guy a Venmo
request for two pennies

86
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:28,500
to get his two cents about
Jordan and I being his agents.

87
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,792
And that worked?

88
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:33,125
Fuck yeah, it worked.
That's why I ordered champagne.

89
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,000
We're meeting with his team
tomorrow.

90
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,625
Brave new world.

91
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,957
Is that legal?

92
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:40,082
What, are we gonna
get in trouble?

93
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,457
Excuse me,

94
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:43,125
could we get a check
when you get a chance?

95
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,042
April 11th is coming up soon.

96
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,125
Are you all deep into
wedding plans?

97
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,625
Yeah, less than two months.

98
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,583
Yeah, there's a lot.

99
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,792
Our families,

100
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm the last of my sisters
to get married

101
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,292
so there's a lot of stress

102
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:59,667
around where people
are going to sit.

103
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,083
But then you remember
it's an open bar

104
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,417
and will practically run itself.

105
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,833
And if it does all fall apart,
we're skipping town.

106
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,875
We're doing a road trip
honeymoon.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,250
It was my idea.

108
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,458
Oh, that friend of mine
that was staying with us...

109
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,125
- Are we allowed to tell them?
- Yeah, you can tell 'em.

110
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,792
Okay, so a friend of mine
from Berkeley,

111
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:20,167
she was staying with us, right?
She's a flight attendant.

112
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:23,333
She was telling us all these
crazy stories about flying.

113
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,667
Like they have plans to
flip the plane upside down

114
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:27,625
in case there's a terrorist,
and having to land early

115
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,917
because of people having
anxiety attacks,

116
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,417
really interesting stuff,
really insane.

117
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,458
Anyway, she was telling us
a story about

118
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:35,958
a totally normal flight,

119
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,125
and this woman and her
husband are in first class

120
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,583
for their honeymoon,
I guess,

121
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,167
and they're getting off
the plane

122
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,458
and the woman collapses,

123
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,833
young woman, newlyweds.

124
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:48,208
And she is beautiful
apparently, right?

125
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,875
They realize she's got
blood on her,

126
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,167
but she says she's fine,

127
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,792
nobody knows what's going on.

128
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,417
The TSA gets involved.

129
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:59,208
They realize that some of
the blood has dried on her.

130
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,458
Turns out,
she and her husband

131
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,833
got into a fight about
God knows what

132
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:05,667
and he stabbed her in the ribs

133
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,667
with an in-flight
champagne bottle.

134
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:10,458
So they all think it's
a sex trafficking thing but it's not.

135
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,750
They bring everybody in.
She tells the TSA

136
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,458
they both work in careers
where image is everything

137
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:17,083
and she just didn't want
anybody to know

138
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,583
that they'd been fighting.

139
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:20,917
Isn't that insane?

140
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:23,250
Thank you guys
so much for coming in.

141
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,042
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

142
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,917
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

143
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,625
Oh, could you?

144
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,292
I mean I only had
one glass of wine.

145
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,375
Did you? 'Cause I feel like
you had about three or four.

146
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,042
That's when you usually start
telling your long stories.

147
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,208
I definitely didn't have
the lamb kebabs, that's crazy.

148
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,375
I hate lamb,
would never order that.

149
00:11:38,792 --> 00:11:39,792
No, no.

150
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,958
Yes.

151
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,458
APE, this is Amy.

152
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,625
So what is a packaging deal?

153
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,458
Packaging deals are
large payments

154
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:43,042
that we get when a TV show
or movie is greenlit

155
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,875
for us having arranged the
creative team behind a project.

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,333
It is an ancillary,
often private contract,

157
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,250
that allows us to
wield our power

158
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,375
to enter deals for way more
than the 10%

159
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,667
we're making
from our client pool.

160
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,083
There's no such thing as
problems, okay?

161
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,000
Only opportunities.

162
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,000
Now, the cocksuckers
at the WGA

163
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,750
trying to tell everybody
about packaging

164
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:04,000
and getting their members
to leave our agency

165
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,375
is the biggest opportunity
we've ever faced.

166
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,250
It would mean
the end of growth for us.

167
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:13,708
Now, what that means is
that this building here,

168
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:17,208
this structure that
we're in right now, um...

169
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,250
it won't...

170
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,958
it won't be around anymore.

171
00:14:30,917 --> 00:14:32,375
- Hi, Jordan.
- Yes.

172
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,625
I installed that
Chrome extension

173
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,875
that wishes your friends
happy birthday...

174
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
- Uh-huh.
- And PJ's looking for you.

175
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,208
The China team arrived
30 minutes early.

176
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,667
Uh-huh, okay, wait, sorry,
you said China's here?

177
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,083
China's here right now?

178
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,000
- Why is China here?
- Jordan, Jordan.

179
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:47,208
Hey, hey, Raymond's here.
China's here. Come on.

180
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,625
Jaclyn, was I taken
off of the email chain?

181
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,667
We're supposed to
meet in the lobby

182
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:50,750
for small talk and handshakes.

183
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,167
That's Psychology 101.

184
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,708
You asked me to take you
off that email chain.

185
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,250
- Hey, PJ.
- Okay, well put me back on.

186
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,581
Hey, yeah, whatever.
They're talking new productions.

187
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,792
They love Marvel.
They want our roster.

188
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,333
- Okay? Great.
- I love it, it's exciting.

189
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,667
Things are moving, it's exciting.
I can take you to 100%.

190
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:02,917
Flattery's not gonna
work on this guy, okay?

191
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,667
He's smart.
Dude, we did this.

192
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,708
His wife's name's Laura.
He supports the Chinese government.

193
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,708
It's between us and CAA.
I will not let this happen again.

194
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,042
Fuck CAA, that should be
my license plate. Come on.

195
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,375
Nope, actually,
give me that back.

196
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Hey, dude, forget about
your wedding invitation

197
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,083
for five fucking seconds, okay?

198
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,167
You don't let him sit.
You say, "Let's keep talking.

199
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:17,708
Let's keep talking."
<i>Hunyíng</i> means

200
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,667
welcome to the team and
you've got to get it right.

201
00:15:20,792 --> 00:15:22,625
Jordan, this is China.

202
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,625
<i>Hunyíng.</i>

203
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,125
Okay great.
Come on.

204
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:36,917
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey, there's my guy.

205
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,000
- Jordan Hines, how are you?
- <i>Ni hao.</i>

206
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,083
<i>Ni hao,</i>
"ni how" the hell are ya?

207
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,583
Welcome to Hollywood.

208
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,542
- Want some coffee?
- No, no coffee for me,

209
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,625
thank you,
I have an ulcer.

210
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,042
Our bonehead of an assistant

211
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,750
- must've miscommunicated...
- What's an ulcer?

212
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,458
An ulcer, oh, uh,
it's nothing.

213
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,125
It's, uh... It's uh...

214
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,542
It's an open sore
on my insides.

215
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,750
It might kill me.

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How was your flight?

217
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,958
Uh, it's fine.
No, no, it's fine.

218
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,708
It's, uh... No, it's false alarm,
it's okay.

219
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,500
Please have a seat. Please,
have a... No, have a seat.

220
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:07,833
Please, no, please,
have a seat.

221
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,833
Yeah, have a seat,
everybody have a seat.

222
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,208
<i>It's exciting.
I'm excited.</i>

223
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,042
<i>I am excited.</i>

224
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,417
<i>It's exciting.</i>

225
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,292
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

226
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,958
<i>Just get the package.</i>

227
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,250
<i>Just get the packaging deal.</i>

228
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,250
<i>The building
isn't collapsing.</i>

229
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,417
<i>Well let's keep talking.
I'm excited.</i>

230
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,542
<i>Well, let's keep talking.</i>

231
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey! Hey!

232
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,583
Ma'am!
Don't throw shit at my car.

233
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,125
I lease this fucking car.

234
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,375
Ma'am!

235
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:34,625
What the fuck?

236
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,583
Is that him?

237
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:23,167
Yeah, that's him.

238
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:24,917
Sorry, we don't have to
stay long.

239
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,042
It's important to come across
as enthusiastic and authentic

240
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,333
when you're signing someone
like this,

241
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,250
when it's this big of
a commitment.

242
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,333
I'm gonna get you home soon.

243
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,250
- Go for it.
- Okay.

244
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,875
Raymond, Jordan Hines,
how are you?

245
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,667
Got you.

246
00:18:56,792 --> 00:18:59,417
- I love it.
- Of course you do.

247
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:02,250
I wanted to introduce you
to my future wife, Caroline,

248
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,083
who's fucking here somewhere.
Um...

249
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,625
Whatever, grab yourself
a drink, huh?

250
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,792
No, I'm just the driver
tonight, five years sober.

251
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,917
I wanted to, um, make sure

252
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,208
that you had everything
that you needed

253
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,125
before you left to go to China

254
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,458
and our agency represents
a lot of intellectual property.

255
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,000
So if there's ever
anything that you wanted

256
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,083
to make into a TV show
or a movie,

257
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:21,917
even if there's an article
that you read maybe

258
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:23,333
we'd be happy to look into
acquiring those rights-

259
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,583
- Everyone!
- Yeah.

260
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,333
Excuse me, everyone.

261
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,625
The silent auction ends
in 25 minutes,

262
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,792
so place your bids.

263
00:19:32,917 --> 00:19:34,875
Everything is tax deductible,

264
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,667
and it's for a great cause.

265
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,292
So don't be cheap, huh?

266
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:41,500
And speaking of cheap,

267
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:44,542
I'm looking at these piece
of shit agents who snuck in.

268
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,375
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,708
- He's a character.
- You know what happens

270
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,542
if you cheat,
what happens?

271
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:53,375
Yeah.

272
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,083
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

273
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,917
Thank you so much
for having us.

274
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:22,542
I wanted to ask where did
you order the flowers?

275
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:25,625
I got them from a website.

276
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,250
- Fleur-de-Lis?
- That's right.

277
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,833
Yeah, that's who we're
using for the wedding.

278
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,417
- Honey, aren't they beautiful.
- Yeah, they're gorgeous.

279
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:32,875
We live in the future,
isn't that exciting?

280
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,333
When are you getting married?

281
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,000
Very, very soon.

282
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:40,292
Honey?

283
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,750
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

284
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm just gonna... I'm gonna
say something to him.

285
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,250
I'm gonna lose him
and I just wanna...

286
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,125
let me just...
give me one more try,

287
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,500
just give me one more try.

288
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,458
Raymond, uh,
I just wanted to say

289
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,667
thank you so much
for having us.

290
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:03,500
My fiancée and I are leaving,

291
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,833
and I wanted to say
one last thing to you,

292
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,750
that we're not
the angry bulldogs

293
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,875
that <i>Entourage</i>
makes us out to be.

294
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,958
I think television tends to
make us out to be

295
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,542
these angry petty people.

296
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,000
But a lot of that film industry
aspect left with Harvey.

297
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,000
Who the fuck is this?

298
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:28,417
So the world is entering into
this really exciting time

299
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:30,542
of digital international growth
and we're a part of it.

300
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,625
And the way that our team works,

301
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,667
I feel like it could make
life very exciting for you

302
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:37,042
with the way that
we package our projects.

303
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,417
I don't need anything
packaged.

304
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:42,208
That's a term you made up
to steal people's money,

305
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,583
and it's all gonna collapse
around you.

306
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,625
We don't need agents
to book our travel.

307
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,917
We don't need agents to
pretend to be producers.

308
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,083
You are a dying social network,

309
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,667
and everyone can't wait
to watch you fall apart.

310
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,958
Well let's keep talking.

311
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,375
Love the honesty.

312
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,000
We love that.

313
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,875
Thank you for having us.

314
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,083
How is your ulcer?

315
00:22:35,208 --> 00:22:38,292
It's fine.
Killing me.

316
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,708
So, yeah, he's a really
interesting character.

317
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,375
I had a good long conversation
with him.

318
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,125
It's not a no,
he's gonna think about it.

319
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,458
We're gonna keep the
conversation open.

320
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:49,833
PJ said he would call him in
the morning.

321
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,500
He's the closer,
he'll close the deal.

322
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,917
He did grab me in the groin
before we left.

323
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,833
I think it's a cultural thing.

324
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,583
And if he signs with CAA,
it's not the worst thing in the world.

325
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,667
He could still be
a hip pocket client.

326
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,250
We could still package
some things for him.

327
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,125
Maybe bring some of his
Chinese intellectual property

328
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,458
to the United States and develop it
under our studio wing now.

329
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,125
And, yeah, we just signed Tiger Woods
as a director this morning.

330
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,917
They're gonna reboot
<i>Caddyshack</i> with dogs.

331
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:12,625
So all in all tonight,
yeah,

332
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,083
tonight was a great night
for everybody.

333
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:17,833
Cool.

334
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,583
Honey, is anything going on?

335
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,708
With me?

336
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,708
No, honey. What?

337
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,417
We're getting married in,
like, six weeks.

338
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,292
If anything were going on,
I'd let you know.

339
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:10,750
No fucking way.

340
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:24,583
Hello?

341
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,542
Hey, there's my guy.

342
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,208
Do you want to do something
helpful?

343
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:48,458
There's my guy.
There he is.

344
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,208
Oh, you're so brave.

345
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:56,000
It's exciting. Exciting.
We're excited. We love it.

346
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:57,292
We're excited.
We're excited.

347
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,792
We're all excited.
Let's keep talking.

348
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,458
Let's keep talking.
Let's keep talking.

349
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:03,583
Terrence, I just got the email
about you joining the WGA.

350
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,083
I'm so sorry to hear that.

351
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,792
I was just about to
put you forward

352
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,000
for a television show
in the writer's room.

353
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,417
But what happened?

354
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,167
I thought you wanted to be
famous.

355
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:19,667
Okay, so let's say some
actor comes up to you

356
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,125
and says you can't
get them work.

357
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,208
You say,
"Get new headshots.

358
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,958
You're calling on my
family phone."

359
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:27,208
Well, that's what's so exciting
is the audience for television

360
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,458
is so much larger than
independent film.

361
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,500
How much longer do you
want to keep making stuff

362
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:32,917
that nobody's seeing?

363
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:36,333
Deflect, attack,
replace victim with offender,

364
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:38,042
D.A.R.V.O.

365
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:41,417
Picture that
your children, starving,

366
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:45,833
and these WGA members
just standing

367
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,583
above your children
and laughing...

368
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,750
'cause that's what
they're doing.

369
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,583
That's what all of the WGA
is doing.

370
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:54,667
They're laughing at
your starving children.

371
00:27:54,792 --> 00:27:57,250
Relax for five fucking
seconds. I'm on the phone.

372
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,167
It's sick.

373
00:27:59,292 --> 00:28:02,167
We're too strong to fail.

374
00:28:02,292 --> 00:28:04,750
We are too strong to fail.

375
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,542
We're too strong to fail.
We are too strong to fail.

376
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,792
Yeah, I own a Tesla.
We're excited.

377
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:10,917
Are you all mine?

378
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,708
I am.

379
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,750
Hey.

380
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:57,875
Hey.

381
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,750
May I have one?

382
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:01,667
Oh, sure.

383
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,583
You'll do great here.

384
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,542
Jaclyn, come on in,
have a seat.

385
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,167
Oh, okay.

386
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:17,042
How are you?

387
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,125
What do you want to do
with your life?

388
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,667
Uh... well,
I don't know yet.

389
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,875
- Uh, this.
- Yeah, right.

390
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,583
Nobody wants to be here forever.

391
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,125
Everybody wants something else.

392
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,625
What do you want?

393
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,208
- Honestly, I do.
- Honestly, you do.

394
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:32,625
What are you from Mayberry?

395
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,833
What are you from
the <i>Andy Griffith Show?</i>

396
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,375
Who talks like that?

397
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,083
What can I do for you?
How can I help?

398
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,333
We have all these retreats
where we wheel out Tony Robbins

399
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:42,250
and he tells us
how happy we are,

400
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,333
how to take over the town,
take control.

401
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,167
Why don't you stop lying
to everybody in the office

402
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,917
all day every day

403
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:50,417
and finally admit
what you actually want?

404
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:52,375
What does Jaclyn want?

405
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,958
Okay.

406
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,000
Could you put me in touch with
the investment firm

407
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,375
I heard you and Raymond's
team talking about?

408
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:04,292
Yes, I will.

409
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,292
Wall Street?

410
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:11,917
See, wasn't that easy?

411
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,083
Now you're not letting that
eat at you from the inside.

412
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,375
Doesn't that feel good?

413
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,000
It does.
You're in a good mood.

414
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,333
Did your wife sit on
your face this morning?

415
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,333
What'd you say?

416
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:28,042
Did you wake up on the right side
of the bed this morning?

417
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,333
It's an expression.

418
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:35,458
Oh. Yeah, I guess I...
I guess I did.

419
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:40,167
Well, great.
Thanks for this.

420
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:42,042
I'll have to change my resume
to list working for you on it.

421
00:30:42,167 --> 00:30:43,333
Could you give me till tomorrow?

422
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,833
Yeah, of course...
Yeah, it's nothing.

423
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,542
Oh, and accounting
had questions

424
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,708
about a $10,000 charge that
was put on the company card...

425
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,208
Yeah, that's fine,
I'll take care of that,

426
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,125
- Thank you.
- Open or closed?

427
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,375
Close that door,
thank you.

428
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,167
Ah! No, she said it.

429
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:48,292
Hey, you're here early.

430
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:49,500
We just started the Keurig.

431
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,792
Hey Jaclyn,

432
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,083
can I talk to you
for a second?

433
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:53,708
Yeah, sure, what's up?

434
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:55,042
So we were in my office
yesterday

435
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,542
and I thought I heard you
say something

436
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,250
and I just want to make
sure that you had said it.

437
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,500
It's not a big deal.
You're not in trouble or anything.

438
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,417
- Hey, Maggie.
- Hi, Jordan.

439
00:32:01,542 --> 00:32:02,917
But I said that I would connect you
with the people at Black Rock

440
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:04,542
and then you said something
about waking up on

441
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,292
the right side of the bed.

442
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,375
Do you remember what you
actually said?

443
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:12,458
I'm not sure I understand.

444
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,875
- Okay.
- If it's a big deal,

445
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,500
it's really not that important.

446
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,875
I had my boyfriend work on
my resume with me.

447
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm sorry if I said
something I shouldn't have.

448
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,167
- Uh-huh.
- Was I out of line?

449
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:25,708
- I'm so sorry if I was.
- I'm sure you weren't.

450
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:27,292
And you didn't say anything?

451
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,708
Oh, my God.
What do you think I said?

452
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,792
Okay, so this is great.
So this is a failure, okay?

453
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,625
So I can't use the language that
I'd like to use to you right now

454
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,458
because of the new direction

455
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,583
that the agency and the
country is going so I won't,

456
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,208
and I'll just say that
this isn't working.

457
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,750
Okay? All this isn't,
you aren't working for me.

458
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:51,042
So how are you gonna
come in tomorrow?

459
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,333
Let's call today a wash, okay?

460
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:53,833
How are you gonna come in
tomorrow?

461
00:32:53,958 --> 00:32:56,125
'Cause there is a line of
recent college graduates

462
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,708
that are just dying to
come in here and work,

463
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,875
to sit in that fucking seat.

464
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,125
So tell me, how are you gonna look
tomorrow when you come in?

465
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,833
How are you gonna
convince me today

466
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:07,583
that you're better at your
fucking job tomorrow,

467
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,917
Jacqueline?

468
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:12,833
I'll do better.

469
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,292
I'm still new here.

470
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,125
That's great to hear.
Send over that resume.

471
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,833
I cannot wait to send it out
to new people.

472
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,333
Tell your boyfriend
I said thanks

473
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,583
and don't go on my computer
again.

474
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,708
You don't know the first
fucking thing

475
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,000
about my personal life.

476
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,667
And I am gonna need
new Pepto-Bismol

477
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,042
immediately after lunch.

478
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,542
Hollywood.

479
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,167
Fuck.

480
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,125
Fuck. Hey!

481
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,833
Hello,
how can I help you?

482
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,292
How are you?
I'm wondering if I can get

483
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,500
a receipt printed out
for my stay.

484
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,042
I stayed here a few weeks ago

485
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,750
and my assistant was
cleaning out a car that I own

486
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,958
and must've thrown it away
like a fucking idiot.

487
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,583
Oh, well that happens.
Do you have a copy of your ID?

488
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,792
I do, but I didn't make
the reservation.

489
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:55,958
I work for a big company
and I'm not sure who's name

490
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,625
- it would have been under.
- I see.

491
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,208
So you don't know the name
the reservation was made under?

492
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:02,125
I don't, but it would've been
the 4th of March

493
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,333
in room 320 at about 1:10 p.m.

494
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,208
Or I'm uncertain, it
could have been anytime.

495
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:08,500
Okay.

496
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,667
Well, unfortunately it won't
let me search for that.

497
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,417
Is there a way you can get
the name or card number

498
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:15,750
of the person who made
the reservation?

499
00:35:15,875 --> 00:35:17,917
Okay, so I already said that
there isn't.

500
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,333
I work for a big talent agency

501
00:35:19,458 --> 00:35:22,000
and I'm not a small fry
over there, the big one.

502
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,667
A couple letters,
I'll give you three guesses.

503
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:25,375
You're only gonna need one.
I'm getting married soon,

504
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,167
and I don't know who
would have made the reser...

505
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,792
Are you in the film industry?

506
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,125
I'm not.

507
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,333
Now if you can call someone,

508
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,750
we can get that to you
immediately,

509
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:38,500
but it's hotel privacy policy,
I'm so sorry.

510
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,250
- What if I was robbed?
- I'm sorry, if what?

511
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:42,167
Let's say I was only in
the room for 17 minutes

512
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,750
and somebody stole something
from my safe,

513
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,125
and what if I also thought
that you two at the hotel

514
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,917
had something to do with it?

515
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:49,708
I actually don't know the protocol
for something like that.

516
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:52,000
I think we'd have to
call the police.

517
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,042
And what if I am the police?

518
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:58,333
Sir, if you were the police,

519
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,042
you would've probably called
ahead of time

520
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,625
and you also would've shown me
your ID when I asked for it

521
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,375
and maybe you wouldn't
have spent 45 minutes

522
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,917
telling me how big of
a Hollywood agent you are.

523
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:14,167
Yeah, that's... Yeah.

524
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,542
Is there anything else
we can help you with today?

525
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,083
No, I don't think that
there is.

526
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,250
- Well, thanks for coming in.
- Thanks for having me.

527
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,667
I've got this rumbling
stomach that says,

528
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:31,917
yeah, I need food.

529
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:35,917
- I'm ravenous and I...
- Hey, so sorry, keep going.

530
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,792
And I need people
that are ravenous too.

531
00:36:37,917 --> 00:36:40,833
I need people that are hungry.

532
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,292
When I go to Buca di Beppo,

533
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,083
I order a Fettuccine Supreme
and that server,

534
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,708
she brings out and says...

535
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,375
- What is this meeting about?
- WGA packaging.

536
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,833
- What is it?
- WGA packaging.

537
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,375
Nope, uh-uh, no,
we're not doing that.

538
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,208
Uh, sorry, keep going.
I just don't have time for it today.

539
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,917
I didn't know that this was
gonna be what this was about.

540
00:36:58,042 --> 00:37:00,292
What I initially wanted to
come in here to talk to about...

541
00:37:00,417 --> 00:37:02,250
It's fine. It's fine,
we're too strong to fail,

542
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:03,833
everybody's doing great.

543
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:07,042
I wanted to talk to PJ
and see if you have that thing.

544
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,292
Uh, that... You remember that
thing? Stop talking.

545
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,583
Do you have that thing
that we used to do a lot

546
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:12,917
and now I'm not doing
too much anymore?

547
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,583
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

548
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,208
- Top drawer.
- Great, thanks.

549
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:19,125
- It's not what you think.
- Excuse me, Jaclyn.

550
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,250
Walking, thank you.

551
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:25,583
Should I keep going?

552
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:32,042
I think maybe now is
a good time we all take a break

553
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:36,292
and reassess exactly
what it is we're doing here.

554
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,708
- How's your stomach?
- It's fine.

555
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,833
- You seem stressed.
- I'm not stressed.

556
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:57,333
I just feel like I have this
huge thing

557
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,625
that's hanging over me
at all times.

558
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,208
Well, it was nice almost
planning a wedding with you.

559
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,333
Okay, hey, I'm here.
What can I do?

560
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:06,750
What do you need from me?

561
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:08,875
It's just the fucking
place cards.

562
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:12,500
Did you read the email?

563
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,125
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

564
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,375
The place card setting email.
Yeah.

565
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
- Yes?
- Loved it.

566
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:24,500
When's the last time
you hung out with PJ?

567
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,167
I mean he's your
actual friend, right?

568
00:38:26,292 --> 00:38:28,083
Why don't you talk to him
about this?

569
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,542
See, you're smart.

570
00:38:33,667 --> 00:38:35,458
I guess that's why we're
getting married, right?

571
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,083
It is.

572
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,083
You worry too much.

573
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,708
Most people don't get so
worked up about their job.

574
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,167
Everything's gonna be great.

575
00:39:10,625 --> 00:39:13,208
Because I saw it on your iPad
when it was syncing

576
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:15,500
and then you deleted it from your phone!

577
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,958
I don't know what you're talking about!

578
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:19,792
How the fuck could you do this to me?

579
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,083
It's really not what you think.

580
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:26,708
Like I'm not going to have someone
follow you when you're acting like this?

581
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,000
I stay in hotels all over the world!

582
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:32,000
Not in our fucking neighborhood!

583
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,458
Calm down.

584
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:41,958
I don't have time for this.

585
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,500
You're hysterical.

586
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:08,667
<i>Hello, you've
reached the law offices</i>

587
00:40:08,792 --> 00:40:09,792
<i>of Kay, Donovan,
and Associates.</i>

588
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,458
<i>Please leave a message</i>

589
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,417
<i>and we'll get back to you

590
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:16,417
This is Laura.

591
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,875
Please have Jerry
call me back.

592
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,875
I shot Raymond in the car.

593
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,750
Um, okay, can I just
do a vodka soda please?

594
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:30,917
- Two please.
- Thank you.

595
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:33,625
- Thank you.
- Uh, wow, two, okay.

596
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,583
Uh, yeah, shit, two please,
thank you.

597
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:40,375
Cold feet?

598
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,167
What are we doing here?

599
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,333
A couple of weeks ago,

600
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,417
I got a letter in the mail

601
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:57,375
inviting me to
a no strings attached

602
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,625
sexual encounter
in a hotel room.

603
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,958
It was a pretty card,
looked official.

604
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,625
I don't know, I was stupid,
I went.

605
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:09,542
Oh, fuck you. What?
Dude, this is nuts.

606
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,500
I had to wear a blindfold.

607
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,583
I should've kept it,
but the woman...

608
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,500
I can't even tell you.

609
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,917
You know that thing where
something's different

610
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:21,167
inside of the universe
in the multi-verse system

611
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,750
and this is the one
thing that's different.

612
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,292
It felt like that. I don't know,
it's hard to explain.

613
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:25,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

614
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,375
What's going on here?
Hold on.

615
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,917
Wait, this is really happening,
you really did this?

616
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,667
In this climate?

617
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:34,500
Dude, are you fucking suicidal?

618
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,167
I don't know.

619
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:39,250
Okay, okay, wow, holy shit.

620
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:40,583
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

621
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:41,917
- Yeah.
- Sorry, okay.

622
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,583
- Yeah.
- Um, wow,

623
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,542
I thought this was you being mad
at me for signing Raymond.

624
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,750
- This is a huge...
- You signed Raymond?

625
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,083
How the fuck did you
sign Raymond?

626
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,125
Okay, well, hold on,
let's... let's focus.

627
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,542
So, let's focus here, okay?

628
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:55,125
So, okay,
so I know you're serious.

629
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,875
Okay, so let's do this.
So first of all, I'm so sorry.

630
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,042
You clearly have no other
options, you came to me.

631
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,000
So there's no return address,
no stamp,

632
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:06,333
so probably delivered personally
or by a courier maybe.

633
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:07,708
Do you have security cameras
at your building?

634
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:08,958
You probably already
thought about all this.

635
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,625
- Yeah.
- Has anyone reached out to you

636
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,708
on social media in
the past couple months?

637
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,417
It might seem strange.

638
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:15,625
Maybe someone trying
to sabotage the wedding

639
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,958
or like a last hurrah
kind of thing.

640
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:19,667
I can't think of...

641
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:21,542
No.

642
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,958
So you couldn't see her?
Was she wearing a mask?

643
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:26,708
I think so.

644
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,167
She was quick in the room.

645
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:31,333
She definitely had it on
at the beginning.

646
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:33,667
She must've known her way
around the furniture.

647
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:37,000
But then I took it off.

648
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,875
I think she saw my face.
I think she'd recognized me.

649
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,708
And you were alone
in the room?

650
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:45,375
Oh, fuck.
Yeah, now I don't know.

651
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,208
See, that's the reason I wanted

652
00:42:47,333 --> 00:42:48,917
to fucking talk about
this in the first place.

653
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,958
Why didn't you just
take the fucking mask off?

654
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,292
I didn't want her to know
it was me.

655
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:56,542
I don't know, deniability,
self-protec...

656
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,125
I don't know, I think
I was fucking terrified.

657
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,333
- Oh, thank you.
- Here you go.

658
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,125
- Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

659
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:04,542
No idea where
that letter came from?

660
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,583
I'm sorry I told you
all of this.

661
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:08,250
No, dude, totally fine.

662
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,917
Now I'm suspicious of everyone.

663
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,000
Maybe it's your wife.

664
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:15,833
Maybe it's my wife.

665
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:18,333
Dude, this could be anybody.
This could be an ex-client.

666
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:21,000
Nope, this is CAA. Yep.

667
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,083
You know,
I was thinking about this.

668
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,083
I was thinking about
doing something like this

669
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,583
as a business.

670
00:43:28,708 --> 00:43:30,042
Can't do this shit anymore.

671
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,792
With my wife?

672
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,708
Her whole family's lawyers.

673
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,583
She would cut
my fucking head off.

674
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,250
She'd get away with it.

675
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:43,667
Dude, if I got one of
these fucking things,

676
00:43:43,792 --> 00:43:46,083
I would be sleeping in that
mail room.

677
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,625
Excuse me!
Can we get a check, please?

678
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,458
My life is fucking terrible.

679
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,208
Hi, I'd like to file a
complaint against the building.

680
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,417
Oh, no, I'm sorry to hear that.
What's going on?

681
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:15,165
A friend of mine was murdered
and I've been robbed.

682
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,081
Maybe by the same person.
I thought I'd go to you

683
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:18,875
before calling 911 'cause
I'm a fucking adult.

684
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,458
Oh, my God, what happened?

685
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,750
I need to see
security camera footage

686
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,042
from the 22nd of February,

687
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,375
the front lobby,
the cul-de-sac

688
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,750
and anything that leads to
the mail room.

689
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,292
Someone has been leaving me
death threats.

690
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:28,708
And also,
I'm a police officer.

691
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,292
Oh, God.
You're... Okay.

692
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,875
Uh, well look, we'll do
everything we can to help,

693
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,375
but I don't think
we can show...

694
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,708
Okay, no, so I need to see
security camera footage

695
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,792
and I need to see it
right fucking now.

696
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,500
Hi, I'm dealing with a stalker

697
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,750
and I'm trying to stay calm
for the sake of my future wife

698
00:44:42,875 --> 00:44:45,458
who's upstairs right now
scared half to death.

699
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,125
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

700
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,917
He's sorry, we're all sorry,
everybody's sorry.

701
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:51,000
Let's see security camera
footage, right?

702
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,833
- It's corporate policy...
- Okay, no.

703
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:56,125
All right,
let's try this again.

704
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,167
Hi, my name is Jordan Hines.
I'm an excellent fucking tenant.

705
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:01,667
I never come down here.
My rent is always on time.

706
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:03,792
I'm one of those guys you
never have to worry about.

707
00:45:03,917 --> 00:45:06,292
I didn't complain when people
started Airbnb'ing out their apartments

708
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:08,542
or when the hot tub was
cold for a fucking month.

709
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,792
I'm not going away.
I'm not uncomfortable,

710
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,583
my clients enjoy
spending time with me.

711
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:14,125
Let me see security camera
footage

712
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,833
from the 22nd of February

713
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,583
and I won't spend
thousands of dollars

714
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,167
having an Indian click farm

715
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:21,500
bomb your fucking
apartment complex on Yelp.

716
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,792
It's right through that door.

717
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:25,542
I know exactly where it is.

718
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:28,917
Now, is there a problem here?

719
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:35,042
Where's the best place to send
a lawsuit?

720
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,583
Where's the best address
for me to send a lawsuit to?

721
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,042
There. There stop.

722
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,667
See? See?

723
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:52,875
Don't let fucking weird
people into the building

724
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,083
who don't have a key card, okay?

725
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,333
Who the fuck is this guy?

726
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,500
Am I alone here?

727
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:57,875
Who the fuck is this guy?

728
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,458
This isn't a motel.

729
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:02,667
I don't pay to live in
a fucking motel, okay?

730
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:10,708
Who the fuck is this guy?

731
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,208
This is fuckin' dead.

732
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:18,083
Now you gotta die.

733
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,458
Now you fucking gotta die.

734
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:23,583
- Piece of shit.
- Hey, hi, sorry.

735
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,042
Sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm
so sorry, I'm not violent.

736
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:26,915
I just want to talk to you.
I got a question for you,

737
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,500
I got a question for you. I'm so sorry.
I got a question for you.

738
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,125
- Help!
- Shut the fuck up, okay?

739
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,875
I got a question for you,
I'm sorry. Who's paying you

740
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,167
- to deliver shit to my building?
- Fuck you, get out of my way.

741
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,292
You're delivering shit
to my building.

742
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,917
I have a right to know. Okay,
I get it, you probably have

743
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,417
naked pictures of me,
it's not that big of a deal.

744
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:40,083
How does it work?
Tell me how you work.

745
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,875
- Help!
- Shut the fuck up.

746
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:46,042
Shut the fuck up.
Okay, I'm sorry.

747
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:48,625
Look, I don't carry cash on me
if that's what you fucking want.

748
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,333
Okay, yeah, I just need to know
who you work for.

749
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,042
Who's paying you to deliver
shit to my building?

750
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:54,208
I don't want to hear,
"Oh, I don't know, I wasn't there".

751
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,083
- I work for an app.
- This is Hollywood.

752
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:57,792
This is the big time, okay?

753
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,083
Don't fucking move.

754
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:01,167
Don't fucking move!
Stay right there.

755
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,500
Don't deliver junk mail
to my building anymore,

756
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,750
okay, asshole?

757
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:08,042
I'm gonna look into this.

758
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:17,250
- Can I help you?
- Hey, there's my guy.

759
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,542
I'm a neighbor and I found
some mail in the street.

760
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:22,917
Some asshole already opened it

761
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:25,792
but I'm wondering if
Louise Rafferty's home?

762
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:27,625
Louise is no longer with us.

763
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:31,000
That's convenient.

764
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,333
Excuse me?

765
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,208
Look, buddy.
I'm a private investigator.

766
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,750
Do not fuck with me today.

767
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,083
I need some questions answered
by Louise

768
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,708
and I'd like to talk to her
immediately.

769
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,917
- Hi, I'm sorry.
- Oh, there she is.

770
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:42,833
- Go back inside.
- Is there a problem?

771
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:44,458
It's nothing.

772
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:45,792
This man is confused.

773
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:47,292
He lost his dog

774
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:50,167
and he's handing out
flyers in the neighborhood.

775
00:47:50,292 --> 00:47:53,333
Oh. What kind of dog is it?

776
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,958
It's a cocker span...
it's a Dalmatian.

777
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,625
I'm so sorry for your...

778
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:06,000
I had no idea it was
a funeral.

779
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,917
I have to go.

780
00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,208
Thank you for your time.

781
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:12,917
We'll keep an eye out for
your dog.

782
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:14,625
Yeah, thank you.
We got people looking.

783
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,750
She gets under cars
and stuff so...

784
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,750
What's up?

785
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,875
- Oh, fuck, you all right?
- Yeah.

786
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,333
- Jesus.
- Yeah, sorry.

787
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:55,833
Vodka soda, double.
Thanks.

788
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:57,375
All right,
so this shit is crazy.

789
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,750
- So the envelopes... Are we good?
- Yeah, we're fine.

790
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,125
- You sure?
- Yes.

791
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,917
Okay, all right, so
the envelopes are stock.

792
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:05,417
They're made from this company
called Hermes Post in Burbank.

793
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:07,250
They're this online company.
They make a bunch of those

794
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:08,625
corporate party invites
and shit.

795
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,958
Which is what we were
worried about.

796
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,667
The P.O. box in Hollywood
is anonymous.

797
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:13,792
It's set up through the website
so that's another dead end.

798
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,458
- All right, shit.
- Hold on, all right, stop.

799
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:18,583
Okay, that's the easy stuff.

800
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,250
Hey, can you make that two,
actually? Thank you.

801
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:26,792
Okay, I'm gonna talk
and I'm gonna finish,

802
00:49:26,917 --> 00:49:30,458
and then you can say
whatever you're gonna say.

803
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:32,750
But please just let me
get through this

804
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,167
'cause it's important. Okay?

805
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,458
Okay.

806
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:43,000
Okay.

807
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,917
When social media platforms
first began,

808
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:46,750
they were based solely
on connecting people,

809
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:48,167
but then they were bastardized

810
00:49:48,292 --> 00:49:49,833
and turned into these
money-making machines

811
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:52,125
that would harvest your data
and sell it to advertisers.

812
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,208
So say you clicked on
something back in college,

813
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,708
all those clicks,
all those likes

814
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:57,167
from then all the way till now,

815
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,000
that's all been saved by
these companies.

816
00:49:59,125 --> 00:50:00,625
And then in 2013,

817
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,958
they started allowing other
companies to use that data

818
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,542
to target you as a consumer

819
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,708
for all your specific
interests and behaviors.

820
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,875
Every like on Twitter you've
ever had, that's all public.

821
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,458
You can go on anyone's
social media account

822
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:12,167
and see everything they've
liked from the beginning.

823
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:15,917
Now, all of that data
is scrapable.

824
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:18,208
Meaning someone could
come up with a program

825
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,583
that would compile
all of that data

826
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,708
from your complete
online digital footprint

827
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:25,042
and use it to better understand
you and how to get to you.

828
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,875
And if I were doing this,
I'd go after the wealthy.

829
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,625
So say you're on social media

830
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,417
and you follow Forbes
and Lamborghini

831
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,125
and Yacht Clubs and
Hollywood agencies, yeah.

832
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,875
And on top of that,
let's say you're also engaged

833
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,375
and that for
the past three months,

834
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,625
you've also been off and on

835
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,833
liking pictures of
half naked women.

836
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,625
- Fuck me.
- Let me finish.

837
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,333
Half naked women.

838
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,500
That would mean one,

839
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:50,708
you probably make
a lot of money,

840
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,542
and two,
with a little push,

841
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:54,375
you'd probably stray
from your relationship.

842
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,083
So that person could then pair
you with someone identical,

843
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,667
someone who would seem
perfect to you.

844
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:01,542
- Is there anything else?
- No, please fuck off.

845
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,667
Thank you.

846
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:06,917
I'm sorry, man,
I... I'm sorry.

847
00:51:07,042 --> 00:51:08,292
Which would make you
an incredible candidate

848
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,417
for this new service.

849
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:10,917
We don't make a lot of money.

850
00:51:11,042 --> 00:51:13,250
We act like we do.

851
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,458
You'd rent out Airbnbs
or hotels,

852
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,000
you know,
something aspirational,

853
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:19,000
and then they'd have you.

854
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,208
It's the ultimate click bait,
thirst trap.

855
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,708
Uh, it's when, uh...
Just look it up.

856
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,958
Actually, don't...

857
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,125
Don't worry about it,
doesn't matter.

858
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:30,625
The point is...

859
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,917
adultery's down drastically.

860
00:51:34,042 --> 00:51:36,417
People are so terrified of
stepping out of line at all

861
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,417
they don't even talk about it.

862
00:51:38,542 --> 00:51:41,250
'Cause consequences
won't go away anymore.

863
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,625
Scarlet letter.

864
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,417
Scarlet letter, yeah.

865
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,292
The Public used to be
the bad guy.

866
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:50,833
Remember that?

867
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:57,583
I mean it's a great idea
for a startup.

868
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,417
Anonymous.

869
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:02,833
Cost of a hotel room...

870
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:03,958
and a couple stamps.

871
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:08,208
Are you doing this to me?

872
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:12,625
No.

873
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:20,833
All right, dude,
most importantly,

874
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,000
a woman was murdered off
Franklin Ave.

875
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:24,333
On February 21st,

876
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:25,917
three blocks from
your apartment.

877
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,917
Domestic dispute, Swedish,
no priors,

878
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,708
seemed totally normal people,
I looked them up.

879
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:32,042
The guy stabbed her

880
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,583
and threw her over a balcony.

881
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:35,542
Cops were responding to
a call she made beforehand.

882
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:36,958
When they brought the guy in,

883
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,292
he was screaming about
the US Postal Service.

884
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,167
She called beforehand?

885
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,333
This sounds like me.

886
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,625
I thought so too.

887
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:53,500
Hey, can we close out, man?

888
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:57,583
Excuse me, sir.
Can we close out, sir?

889
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,708
Just not... just gonna
ignore me now.

890
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:01,833
I'm gonna have to apologize.

891
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,208
Sir?

892
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:20,583
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Lisa, it's Jordan.

893
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,583
- <i>Jordan?</i>
- Hines, how are you?

894
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:27,333
<i>Hey, Jordan,
I'm good, how are you?</i>

895
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:29,458
I'm doing well.
I just wanted to call.

896
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,500
I guess we haven't
spoken since graduation.

897
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,500
How are you doing?
Where are you living these days?

898
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,333
<i>I'm still in Braintree,
actually.</i>

899
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:38,708
<i>Ross and I ended up at
the same hospital.</i>

900
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:40,333
Oh, well, that's lucky.

901
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:42,042
You ever make it out to
Los Angeles?

902
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,708
<i>I don't.</i>

903
00:53:43,833 --> 00:53:45,917
<i>It's tough with a toddler.</i>

904
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:50,000
Wow, that's crazy.

905
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:51,875
Because I thought I saw you
on Franklin

906
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,833
a couple of weeks ago.
Was it you?

907
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,292
<i>Uh, yeah, no, not me.</i>

908
00:53:57,417 --> 00:53:59,708
<i>It must've been
my doppelganger.</i>

909
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,625
<i>How are you liking LA?</i>

910
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:04,417
I love LA.

911
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:05,875
About an hour from the lake,

912
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,875
five years sober,
working on my ten.

913
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,375
<i>That's great.</i>

914
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,750
<i>That's so great to hear,
congratulations.</i>

915
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,208
<i>I always knew
you'd figure it out.</i>

916
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,667
You sure it wasn't you?

917
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,083
I just thought...

918
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:23,125
you'd added me on LinkedIn
a couple days earlier.

919
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,042
I was almost certain it was you.

920
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:27,208
<i>Uh, no.</i>

921
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:29,583
<i>You popped up as
a suggested follow,</i>

922
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:31,417
<i>because of school I guess.</i>

923
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:34,458
<i>I... I thought, you know,
I haven't seen you.</i>

924
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:37,708
I was pretty sure.

925
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,833
I guess you wouldn't even
tell me if it was, huh?

926
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:43,917
<i>I'm not sure
what you're asking me.</i>

927
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:45,875
I'm so sorry.
This is uncomfortable.

928
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,958
This sounds like one of those
phone calls you hear about

929
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:49,750
where some idiot calls you
ten years late

930
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:52,125
and makes a fool of
himself, isn't that right?

931
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,458
<i>No, no, I just want to
make sure you're okay.</i>

932
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,875
I'm fine, everything's great
with me.

933
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,458
Uh, I must have
disturbed you again

934
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:00,625
and I'm so sorry about that.

935
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,375
Uh, this isn't
a midlife crisis.

936
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,042
I'll let you know when
I'm having one of those.

937
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,458
- <i>No, it's fine.</i>
- I'm fine.

938
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,792
Everything's fine.
I just wanted to check in.

939
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:09,417
It must be so late over there,
I'm so sorry.

940
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:10,542
Congratulations
with everything,

941
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:12,417
thanks so much for
the connect

942
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,917
and, um, we're all excited.

943
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:16,333
So, uh, good night and, um...

944
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,750
and yeah, goodnight,
yeah, that's it.

945
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,250
<i>All right,
congrats on your engagement.</i>

946
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,458
Yeah, great, thank you, bye.
All right, bye now, take care.

947
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:27,625
Woof.

948
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,333
Hey, Jaclyn, perfect timing.

949
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:39,083
I'm wondering if you can
send all my phone calls

950
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:40,792
to my cell tomorrow

951
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:43,125
'cause I've gotta boogie to the
east side for some meetings.

952
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,625
Don't worry about that.
I'm gonna pay for it.

953
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,792
Sorry about that.

954
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:49,167
I'm gonna pay for it.

955
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:52,750
I'm gonna pay for it.

956
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,000
Ugh, wi-fi's down.

957
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,167
Mm-hmm.

958
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,000
Did you throw
this blanket on here?

959
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,375
It looks nice.

960
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,667
It's from
the honeymoon.

961
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:21,667
Ah.

962
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:27,875
Can I get you anything?

963
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,917
Yeah, come here.

964
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:31,958
Come sit.

965
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,875
Man. I'll tell ya.

966
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,708
What do we do with all this?

967
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,167
You know, I spend so much
time off set these days.

968
00:56:44,292 --> 00:56:45,708
Let's just go.

969
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:50,333
Let's go back to that
villa in Rome.

970
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:52,208
We can have my mom come out.

971
00:56:53,708 --> 00:56:56,167
Who is sick of everything regular?

972
00:56:58,083 --> 00:56:59,167
You hated Rome.

973
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:02,167
No, I hated the palaces.

974
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:06,208
You buy a palace to get away
from the fucking crowds.

975
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,750
Nowadays, you can't even see
the artwork

976
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:09,208
because everybody's waving

977
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,750
a thousand fucking cameras
in front of it.

978
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:15,542
The public.

979
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,167
What do you think?

980
00:57:18,292 --> 00:57:20,083
I can get Ben to look on Zillow

981
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:24,083
to see if we can buy
a place in Rome?

982
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:26,917
What do you think?

983
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,042
Sounds like a dream.

984
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,167
A good dream?

985
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,333
Help.

986
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,875
Help.

987
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,792
Okay, guys, now this is
the fun part.

988
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:33,667
- We're gonna take the shrimp...
- You all right?

989
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:36,042
Yeah, it's exciting,
I love it.

990
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,792
The heat's gonna make it
easier to wrap.

991
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:39,167
Let's make sure we don't
burn ourselves.

992
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,167
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm just hot, honey,

993
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,458
I'm right next to the stove and
I'm wearing this stupid fucking outfit.

994
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,000
- How are we doing over here, Caroline?
- Fine I think.

995
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,583
Okay, well we forgot
the carrot slices

996
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,250
but that's okay,
we can always boil...

997
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:49,708
No, actually we don't want
carrot slices with ours.

998
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,417
- Thank you so much.
- Nope, let's do it right,

999
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:53,042
at least the first time, okay?

1000
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:55,500
So Caroline, you want
to grab those carrots?

1001
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,875
No, don't help, stop.
I... We don't need any...

1002
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,583
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm just hot,
I'm right next to...

1003
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:02,292
Can I take this off?
Is that all right?

1004
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,708
I feel like I'm suffocating
in this fucking outfit.

1005
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,458
Dude, just... just cook, dude,
we're cooking.

1006
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,167
- Yeah, thanks, PJ, I am cooking.
- Okay, cool, no worries.

1007
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,542
Do you need to maybe go outside
and get some fresh air?

1008
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:10,083
No, I don't need
to go outside.

1009
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,792
I came here to cook, let's cook.
Fuck it, right?

1010
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,083
And now I realize
I've raised my voice.

1011
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:20,583
And now I feel like I'm
losing my fucking mind

1012
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:22,333
'cause nobody's
acknowledging it.

1013
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,458
Buddy, hey, hey, I think
maybe it's a great idea

1014
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:25,792
for you to just go outside
and get some fresh air

1015
00:59:25,917 --> 00:59:27,292
and just think about
the fact that

1016
00:59:27,417 --> 00:59:29,417
we had to pretend this was
our idea so your fiancée

1017
00:59:29,542 --> 00:59:32,208
could spend some quality
fucking time with you so,

1018
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:35,542
spring rolls, we're making
spring rolls.

1019
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:38,625
Once they're rolled, we can
stack them beside each other

1020
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,417
into nice little rows.

1021
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,292
It doesn't matter
if it looks weird,

1022
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,583
it'll taste good, probably.

1023
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:51,500
- I'm sorry.
- I'm fine.

1024
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:53,292
- No, I'm sorry.
- Uh-uh, I'm fine.

1025
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,958
I didn't mean to do that.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1026
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:56,875
Let's stop,
let's get out of here.

1027
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,042
Let's go away, I don't
want to be like this.

1028
00:59:59,167 --> 01:00:00,958
I can see myself and I don't
want to be like this.

1029
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:02,042
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1030
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,292
Okay, I get it, I get it.

1031
01:00:04,875 --> 01:00:06,583
It must be absolutely
exhausting

1032
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:07,917
pretending to be you.

1033
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,500
<i>Hey, you've reached
Jordan Hines.</i>

1034
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:28,833
<i>I'm gonna be out of
contact in the mountains</i>

1035
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:31,583
<i>doing some venue scouting
for our wedding,</i>

1036
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:33,667
<i>but I'm also available.</i>

1037
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:36,208
<i>Okay, yeah, great,
bye now, take care.</i>

1038
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,625
I have this fear
all the time now

1039
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:52,083
that there's this crowd of
people around me

1040
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,208
judging me,

1041
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:55,958
just waiting for me to
slip up...

1042
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:01,583
so they can
tar and feather me...

1043
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:03,208
or drive me out of town.

1044
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:09,125
And I think I end up
thinking about these people

1045
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,625
so much...

1046
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,250
that I sometimes forget
what I really think...

1047
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:22,083
how I really feel
about something.

1048
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:26,542
I watch you when
you're friendly with people

1049
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:30,500
and I don't know if
you've made friends

1050
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:34,375
the way that normal people
make friends

1051
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,542
or if you're just doing it
for the job

1052
01:01:36,667 --> 01:01:39,125
and I don't think you can tell
the difference either.

1053
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,500
Okay, what is this?

1054
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:41,750
Is this a fuck Jordan weekend,

1055
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,625
take me to the mountains
and insult me?

1056
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,417
Honey, I'm not insulting you.

1057
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:48,917
I'm describing you.

1058
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,958
- Would you just stop?
- What?

1059
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:55,458
So I can... So you can
look at me,

1060
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,208
- like look at me when I'm...
- I'm looking at you.

1061
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,625
What are you talking about?
I am looking at you.

1062
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,875
You're not
being honest with me.

1063
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,083
You can't even be honest
about being fucking honest.

1064
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,042
- That's not true.
- Where are you going?

1065
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,167
I'm not going anywhere.

1066
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:08,500
I thought this was the trail.

1067
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,042
You pushed me off
the fucking trail.

1068
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:11,375
I'm not pushing you.

1069
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,250
We're in the middle of
the fucking woods.

1070
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,917
- Talk to me!
- I'm talking to you.

1071
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:18,458
- But be honest with me.
- I am honest with you.

1072
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:20,958
This is not one of your
"fake" relationships.

1073
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:24,542
I am your fiancée,
fucking engage with me.

1074
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:30,042
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you.

1075
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,000
Okay.

1076
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,750
Okay.

1077
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:42,583
- Are you coming?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

1078
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,500
No, honey, I think
he's gonna do a great job.

1079
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,167
I'm just wondering if you
could've picked

1080
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:34,167
a bigger cliche of
a wedding planner.

1081
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:37,125
Oh, you're gonna
make fun of someone

1082
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:39,583
for faking enthusiasm
for their job?

1083
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:52,583
Um, can I do a...
I don't know, cappuccino.

1084
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,792
With honey.
Do you have honey?

1085
01:05:55,917 --> 01:05:59,500
And this fella wants
a large Americano

1086
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,208
with an extra shot.

1087
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,708
A latte with lavender,
I think it was.

1088
01:06:03,833 --> 01:06:06,042
Do you have a special?

1089
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,333
Oh, if I buy...

1090
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:21,375
Hi.

1091
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:25,417
Hi.

1092
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:28,917
Do you know me?

1093
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:31,458
- I'm sorry?
- Sorry to interrupt.

1094
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,667
How did you recognize me?
I'm not famous.

1095
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:38,000
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1096
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:41,375
- You can keep going.
- Oh, okay.

1097
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:48,583
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, Tom.

1098
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,125
How do you know me?
My name is Jordan Hines.

1099
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,208
What's your name?

1100
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:54,708
Is there a problem?

1101
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:57,167
Not anymore, Tom,
I'm fucking great.

1102
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:00,958
Should we leave?

1103
01:07:02,292 --> 01:07:03,417
Y'all can go.

1104
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:05,042
So you do know what I'm
talking about?

1105
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:07,042
Hi, you say y'all.
I say y'all too.

1106
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:08,167
Where you from?

1107
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:12,708
Hi.

1108
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,542
I think he's mistaking her
for someone else.

1109
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:18,750
That's right. I thought you were
an actress I know.

1110
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:21,042
What's your name?
This is my fiancée, Caroline.

1111
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,167
What's your name?

1112
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,042
Hi.

1113
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:29,500
Uh, sorry. Honey?

1114
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,875
I think I need you
to go wait in the car.

1115
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:45,750
- It's work.
- Mm-hmm.

1116
01:07:48,292 --> 01:07:49,375
Do we need to
call somebody?

1117
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,333
No, you don't have to
call anybody

1118
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:52,583
'cause she's gonna say her
fucking name out loud right now

1119
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:55,250
and I'm gonna walk
right out of here.

1120
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,667
I'm not leaving.

1121
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:00,458
How does it work?

1122
01:08:01,792 --> 01:08:02,792
Do you even know?

1123
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:09,208
Are you a prostitute?

1124
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:38,500
Fuck!

1125
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:40,957
Of course! Because of course
she leaves.

1126
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:48,500
<i>Hey, this is Caroline Gates.
Please leave a message.</i>

1127
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,750
Hey, sweetie,
let me explain.

1128
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:53,957
She's a writer and
an up and coming new voice,

1129
01:08:54,082 --> 01:08:55,542
fresh new voices,
female voices,

1130
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:57,167
diversity is
really in right now,

1131
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,082
and I wanted to sign her for
one of our TV productions.

1132
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:03,250
So, of course, it has to
happen today of all days.

1133
01:09:03,375 --> 01:09:06,082
I'm sorry, I'm excited to
explain it to you further tonight,

1134
01:09:06,207 --> 01:09:08,500
and, um, yeah,
so, yeah, goodnight.

1135
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:14,582
Ah!

1136
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:15,707
Ah, fuck!

1137
01:09:18,832 --> 01:09:19,832
You want to walk to Dada?

1138
01:09:19,957 --> 01:09:21,625
Yeah, yeah, hold on, hold on.

1139
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,875
- Come on.
- Shit, hold on.

1140
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
One second, one second,
sorry. Hey.

1141
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,625
<i>Hey, you got money?</i>

1142
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,292
What? No.

1143
01:09:29,417 --> 01:09:30,667
Wait, did you find the guy?

1144
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:32,957
No, I'm about to do
something very stupid.

1145
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:34,500
I need you to bail me out of
jail tonight.

1146
01:09:34,625 --> 01:09:35,957
What the fuck are you
talking about? Hold on, man.

1147
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:37,542
Just tell me where you are,
I'll go with you.

1148
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:39,375
I cannot talk right now.
If I don't call you by 6 p.m.,

1149
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,542
call 911, find out where I am
and I'll pay you back.

1150
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:43,457
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't be a fucking hero.

1151
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:45,167
- You're gonna fuck this up.
- Sweetie, who is it?

1152
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:46,832
Jordan.
Hold on honey, I'm so sorry.

1153
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:48,500
It's probably nothing.
I'll call you at 6 p.m.

1154
01:09:48,625 --> 01:09:50,042
Okay, all right, yeah,
bye now, take care.

1155
01:09:52,292 --> 01:09:54,958
Okay, I'm sorry honey.
Okay I'm sorry.

1156
01:09:55,083 --> 01:09:57,375
Hi honey, I'm so sorry.

1157
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,708
Daddy's coworker's an idiot, hi.

1158
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,042
Daddy needs to learn
boundaries.

1159
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,375
I know, daddy needs to learn
boundaries.

1160
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:06,750
- Agent McAlister.
- Please, call me Bruce.

1161
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:08,292
No problem.
This is Lewis, I'm Rebecca,

1162
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:11,250
we're Michael's assistants.
He's also Michael's son.

1163
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,750
I don't know why I said that.
Thank you for coming.

1164
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,000
- Lead the way.
- Can I get you something

1165
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:16,083
- to drink, a coffee?
- No, thank you so much.

1166
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:17,208
I have an ulcer.

1167
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:21,375
These are them?

1168
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,042
Yep, these are
our purple envelopes.

1169
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:25,042
This is our smaller
four bar version.

1170
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:27,292
We get those ordered
for flower deliveries.

1171
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:30,333
This is our larger legal size.
It fits 11x14.

1172
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:33,208
It's a bigger fabric paper.

1173
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:36,750
And that is our A9
royal purple envelope,

1174
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,875
usually ordered for weddings.

1175
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,125
And they're expensive?

1176
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,542
They're up there.

1177
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:42,667
They're a funny color.

1178
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:44,625
Most brides prefer white.

1179
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,875
Sometimes they take
a liking to 'em,

1180
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,250
but we haven't sold many.

1181
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:49,417
Except for recently?

1182
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:51,375
Except for recently.

1183
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,917
So, about three months ago,
we had a bulk order placed.

1184
01:10:58,042 --> 01:10:59,542
These are all done online.

1185
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:02,000
Our printer's gigantic,
they're sticker sealed.

1186
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,833
From soup to nuts, you
can have an order done

1187
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,208
in an hour and 40 minutes,

1188
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:07,667
printing, calligraphy,
gold leaf, anything.

1189
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:09,042
Until it hits the box

1190
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,708
and needs postage or
a courier picks it up,

1191
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,625
my team doesn't touch it.

1192
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,792
And how big was the order?

1193
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:15,708
314.

1194
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:18,042
314, and that's large?

1195
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:20,292
We print 6,000 a day
in Anaheim.

1196
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,375
314. That's pi.
What's the significance?

1197
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,542
The guy's a fucking mathlete?

1198
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:30,083
Sorry, I get very close to
my cases.

1199
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,542
I know I don't have to ask
but you guys don't have

1200
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:32,667
an address on this guy, right?

1201
01:11:35,042 --> 01:11:36,833
He paid with a credit card,
you gotta have a name for them, right?

1202
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:38,333
Yes, this was
an online purchase.

1203
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:40,500
It was an order under
the name of Johnny PayPal.

1204
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,542
Johnny Pay, no,
that's not a real name.

1205
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:43,792
Nobody's called Johnny PayPal.

1206
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:45,833
I'm sorry.

1207
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:46,958
Okay, so he pays through
PayPal or Stripe

1208
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,333
or some online service.

1209
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,375
Maybe he has an LLC
or an account number.

1210
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,125
Tell me you guys have an EIN.

1211
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,708
That just looked like
obstruction of justice to me.

1212
01:11:58,833 --> 01:12:00,000
Give him the fucking
paperwork.

1213
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,458
I'm so sorry, fuck, fuck.

1214
01:12:03,792 --> 01:12:06,542
Purple Envelope LLC.

1215
01:12:06,667 --> 01:12:09,042
314 envelopes,
what did that run him?

1216
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:13,292
$946 for the full package,
including interior cards.

1217
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:14,583
Let's call it three grand.

1218
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:16,667
Motherfucker did this for
three grand?

1219
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,500
I guess he had to pay for
the hotels,

1220
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,167
unless he owns the hotels.

1221
01:12:23,292 --> 01:12:25,375
You're saying this
guy killed two people?

1222
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,583
You think this is really
gonna help you catch this guy?

1223
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:29,750
I do, Michael.
You're doing the right thing.

1224
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:33,042
- Thank you so much for this.
- Do you have a card on you?

1225
01:12:33,167 --> 01:12:36,250
We don't carry cards, Lewis,
police departments carry cards.

1226
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:38,958
Wow.

1227
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:43,875
Honey!

1228
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Caroline!

1229
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:10,208
There he is.

1230
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,333
Excuse me.

1231
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:27,417
Was there an accident here
a few weeks ago?

1232
01:13:32,833 --> 01:13:34,500
Apartment four,
Swedish people,

1233
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:35,625
you know I'm talking about?

1234
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:38,167
No, no, I don't.

1235
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,625
Okay.

1236
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,375
You know where
apartment 1B is?

1237
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,292
I think it's a basement.

1238
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:49,125
Yes, man, just down
that way to the right.

1239
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,833
Oh, shit!

1240
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:04,750
Oh, fuck!
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

1241
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:07,333
Fuck, fuck, oh, fuck,
fuck, stop. Stop!

1242
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:09,917
How the fuck did you
get in here? Fuck!

1243
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:15,875
Fuck, stop, stop.
Okay, okay, okay, fuck.

1244
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,917
What...
Who the fuck are you?

1245
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,083
What do you want?
You want money?

1246
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:20,208
I'll get you money.

1247
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,625
Fuck.

1248
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:30,250
Yeah, I know who you are.
You're that fucking guy.

1249
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,792
I thought you were dead.

1250
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:34,458
It's been going around
these days.

1251
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,750
Johnny PayPal,
you didn't send somebody,

1252
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:40,250
that's fucking you
under there, huh?

1253
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,833
Yeah.

1254
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:45,542
Shame.

1255
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:47,792
Okay.

1256
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:50,333
Okay, yeah.

1257
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:53,333
You're the guy who didn't
respond to the third letter.

1258
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,333
Everybody else did, fucker.

1259
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:56,917
You made me think
it didn't work.

1260
01:17:58,125 --> 01:17:59,708
This is great.

1261
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:02,042
You want a soda or something?

1262
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,250
You didn't get
the third letter?

1263
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:14,792
Little yellow one?

1264
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,917
Oh, fuck.

1265
01:18:18,042 --> 01:18:20,250
You don't even know.
That makes more sense.

1266
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,083
So now you're here, for what,
to blow me?

1267
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:25,000
No. Fuck.

1268
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:26,542
First letter's the intro,
second letter's the room key,

1269
01:18:26,667 --> 01:18:29,042
third one connects you.
You both wire me five grand

1270
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,792
and I tell you who
the other person is,

1271
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:34,042
and you're the guy
who didn't write back.

1272
01:18:35,292 --> 01:18:37,042
Oooooooh...

1273
01:18:41,208 --> 01:18:43,292
Sorry, I know how this one ends.

1274
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:48,417
Okay, so, yeah,

1275
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:51,083
now you want to know
who she is.

1276
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:57,708
So now you just need me to
connect you to somebody.

1277
01:18:58,750 --> 01:18:59,750
How does that feel?

1278
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:02,500
Not too good, right?

1279
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,125
I could do that.

1280
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,167
Do you mind?

1281
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,500
Okay.

1282
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,167
Sending.

1283
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:48,583
All over, they're sending.

1284
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:53,667
Congratulations,
you played yourself.

1285
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:54,875
You're nobody.

1286
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You don't connect people, I do.

1287
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,708
I don't need to be pretty,
I'm the internet.

1288
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,250
I did you a favor.

1289
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,917
You are just a piece of data

1290
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:04,792
that my system scraped
from The Sony Hacks.

1291
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:06,125
You're not even a person.

1292
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,167
You are an event that has
happened to me.

1293
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:12,250
I found you your search history
soul mate.

1294
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:15,542
You should be
kissing my asshole.

1295
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:17,333
And now you want her bad

1296
01:20:17,458 --> 01:20:19,750
and I'll never tell you.

1297
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:23,000
A thousand times as many letters
going out right now,

1298
01:20:23,125 --> 01:20:24,292
the alpha.

1299
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,667
That's one billion American

1300
01:20:27,792 --> 01:20:28,917
coming to my bank account
next month.

1301
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:32,625
You're the bad guy.
I win.

1302
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:37,333
Get out of my fucking basement,
bro.

1303
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:50,792
Glen, call 911,
I got fucked.

1304
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,375
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1305
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,875
Ugh... the public.

1306
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:14,333
What the fuck!
Fuck, fuck!

1307
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,542
Fuck me!

1308
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:18,458
Asshole, fucking shit,

1309
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,792
fucking loser,
fucking asshole,

1310
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,625
fucking son of a bitch,
Goddamn it.

1311
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,792
Fuck you.

1312
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:25,583
Goddamn it.

1313
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:27,167
Fucking piece of shit.

1314
01:21:28,542 --> 01:21:30,000
Fucking asshole.

1315
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,667
Fucking piece of shit.

1316
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,917
Fucking loser.
Fucking...

1317
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,500
Hey.

1318
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,250
There she is.

1319
01:21:50,625 --> 01:21:54,333
I was in the car
and then I...

1320
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,792
So, yes, I have to talk
to you about something.

1321
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,792
About a month ago,
I got a letter

1322
01:22:16,917 --> 01:22:20,083
inviting me to an exclusive
meeting in a hotel room

1323
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,750
and when I got there,
there was a naked...

1324
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:24,042
Nope, that's a lie. I knew
she was gonna be there.

1325
01:22:24,167 --> 01:22:26,250
Fuck, okay, let's do it.

1326
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,792
Goddamn it,
let's be honest, right?

1327
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:29,167
Fuck you, let's be honest.

1328
01:22:29,292 --> 01:22:31,250
Okay, honesty, honesty.

1329
01:22:31,375 --> 01:22:32,583
Just be honest.

1330
01:22:32,708 --> 01:22:33,875
Just be honest,
how hard is that?

1331
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,250
This is someone you love.

1332
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,833
You're gonna lose her.
Just be honest.

1333
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:38,958
I'm drinking again.

1334
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,292
I'm addicted to nicotine.

1335
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,958
I'm a nobody
outside of my building.

1336
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,792
I spend all day trying to
impress the people on my floor.

1337
01:22:47,917 --> 01:22:49,458
The WGA fight's
just the beginning.

1338
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,667
As soon as the other unions
get involved, we're fucked.

1339
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:53,500
They're never gonna let
us take all the money.

1340
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:55,292
Why did we think they're gonna
let us take all the money?

1341
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:58,125
PJ explained it to me.
We're becoming travel agents.

1342
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,958
Raymond grabbed my dick
at that party

1343
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:01,958
and nobody did anything
about it.

1344
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,625
We kept working with the guy.

1345
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,292
Why do we keep working with
these guys?

1346
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:08,917
'Cause nobody knows
what's going on!

1347
01:23:09,042 --> 01:23:11,125
And everybody
still wants to be Harvey!

1348
01:23:12,042 --> 01:23:13,083
We dress nice.

1349
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:14,792
We want to shout at
subordinates

1350
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:17,083
and fuck people and
get away with it.

1351
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,792
I can't wait to start
grabbing dicks.

1352
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:23,500
I don't know what's happening
to me.

1353
01:23:23,625 --> 01:23:25,917
Honesty, I can see it now.

1354
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,583
Everything you said at the lake,

1355
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:29,292
I just want to be cool and happy

1356
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:31,667
and come across like I'm
wealthy and successful

1357
01:23:31,792 --> 01:23:33,833
and I just look fucking cheesy.

1358
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,500
I don't want to do this anymore.

1359
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:39,458
I fucking hate the internet.

1360
01:23:39,583 --> 01:23:41,417
I just want it to be
the early 2000s.

1361
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,250
I want to be young again.

1362
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:55,875
I impersonated
a federal officer...

1363
01:23:57,542 --> 01:23:58,542
couple times.

1364
01:24:00,042 --> 01:24:01,875
A man down the street
murdered his wife

1365
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,125
and I'm the only person
who knows about it.

1366
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,500
Her name was Louise Rafferty.

1367
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:12,458
My teeth are fucked.

1368
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:15,000
I was disrespectful
to my assistant.

1369
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,750
She could leak my emails
tomorrow.

1370
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:19,167
I think I committed mail fraud.

1371
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:25,500
I went down the stairs
behind the bookshelf,

1372
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,250
I met the Phantom of the opera

1373
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:30,417
and I beat him with
a fucking hammer.

1374
01:24:30,542 --> 01:24:33,292
But no,
I didn't look at

1375
01:24:33,417 --> 01:24:35,708
the place card settings email,

1376
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:37,083
which is what you're thinking,

1377
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:39,042
I can fucking tell,

1378
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:40,500
because deep down

1379
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:45,250
I'm somebody who just
cannot give a shit.

1380
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,208
I don't own the Tesla.

1381
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,958
I've been leasing it
this whole time.

1382
01:24:58,083 --> 01:24:59,083
I think the world's
about to become

1383
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:01,083
a fucking horrifying place.

1384
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:02,875
I think I just watched it
happen.

1385
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,750
It's a place that I would
never have any control over.

1386
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,708
You fell in love with me
'cause I was powerful.

1387
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:10,958
What am I gonna be now?

1388
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah. Do it.

1389
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:21,125
Fuck, I should have
called the cops.

1390
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,250
She was smart.

1391
01:25:22,375 --> 01:25:23,833
I walked right into this one.

1392
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:28,208
I understand

1393
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:29,917
if I'm not the man you thought
you were marrying in six days

1394
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,583
and I'm sorry about that.

1395
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:39,500
I just don't want to be
ashamed anymore.

1396
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:48,792
I forgive you.

1397
01:26:57,958 --> 01:26:59,875
<i>Hello.</i>

1398
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,417
<i>You've reached
Jordan Hines.</i>

1399
01:27:02,542 --> 01:27:04,375
<i>Because of everything,</i>

1400
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:07,083
<i>I am taking a conscientious
leave of absence.</i>

1401
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:10,750
<i>Please reach out to
anybody else in my offices.</i>

1402
01:27:10,875 --> 01:27:13,208
<i>Okay, yeah, all right,
bye now, take care.</i>

1403
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:42,083
How far do you think we can
make it today?

1404
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:44,917
The border if we don't stop.

1405
01:27:58,042 --> 01:27:59,583
So here's the deal.

1406
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:07,542
All this stuff,
it's nothing new.

1407
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,417
It's different
but it's not new.

1408
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:14,000
This could've been
a conversation.

1409
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:29,458
You know, there are people
out there in the dark

1410
01:28:29,583 --> 01:28:32,292
who will do everything
they can to corrupt this,

1411
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:35,792
what we have.

1412
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:41,542
They'll smile at you,
they'll try to trip you up.

1413
01:28:45,667 --> 01:28:47,667
And our job...

1414
01:28:47,792 --> 01:28:48,958
from here on out

1415
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:51,833
is to make sure that
they never win.

1416
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,333
Whenever you're ready.

1417
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:00,792
Oh, thank you so much.

1418
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:09,125
Eight more dead,
New York Times.

1419
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,625
Will you turn that thing off?

1420
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,125
- You ready?
- Yep.
