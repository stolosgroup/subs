It won't be long now.

00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,151
Structural integrity
has passed the point of no return.

4
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,488
I just need to put in
the final calculations.

5
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,081
There has to be another way.

6
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,042
This is the only way.

7
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:19,598
My son, someday I pray you'll have
a child

8
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:22,643
that will bring you as much joy
as you have brought us.

9
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,860
Even in this short time, you have
changed our lives for the better.

10
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:34,155
We love you with all that we are.

11
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,240
Goodbye, my son.

12
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,875
It is time.

<i>Trans-light engines

"In the decade of the 1930s,

15
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,768
even the great city of Metropolis

16

the ravages of worldwide depression.

17
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:57,274
In the times of fear and confusion,
the job of informing the public

18
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,818
was the responsibility
of the <i>Daily Planet."</i>

19
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,988
Somebody kill me.

20
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,784
Why couldn't you guys be,
I don't know, like, doctors or lawyers,

21
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:08,202
or, like, a celebrity chef?

22
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:10,871
Yeah, like, anything besides reporters.

23
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:15,376
Because reporting is an important and
essential part of a civilized society.

24
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,711
They call it
the fifth branch of government.

25
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,131
Or is it the fourth?
Do you know where my purse is?

26
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,383
The couch.

27
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:26,512
But, okay, doing a report on reporters,
it's boring.

28
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,638
Boring?

29
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,723
Good reporters make good stories.

30
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:33,477
Boring reporters don't last long.

31
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,398
Listen, every time I start a story,
I follow a couple of rules.

32
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,358
One, find your hook, your angle.

33
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,444
How can you write this thing
like no one else? It's like...

34
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,282
It's like, you know those
violent video games you play?

35
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,659
I mean, I wouldn't call them violent.

36
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,744
Trust me, they're violent.

37
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,414
In those games, you're always looking
for the weak point, right?

38
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,292
And sometimes, you have to hit them
with different moves,

39
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,835
in different locations to beat it.

40
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,378
Same thing with reporting.

41
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,422
Find your angle, your "in"

42
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:04,049
and you'll vanquish your report
in no time.

43
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,385
I guess.

44
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,555
Hey, which one of us
has won Journalist of the Year?

45
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,598
You or me?

46
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,474
Oh, and one more thing.

47
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,436
With most stories,
we already know the ending.

48
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,314
The airliner crashed.
The girl was saved.

49
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,358
What's interesting is how that happened.

50
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:22,818
How we got there.

51
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,946
Always start at the beginning,
and you'll already have your end.

52
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,323
The rest is cake.

53
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,618
Speaking of which, I have to pick up
the birthday cake by 5:00. Shoot.

54
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,245
You want me to write
about how you two dated?

55
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,788
I love you, Mom, I love you.

56
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:39,585
But you and Dad are the most
unexciting couple in the entire universe

57
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,795
If only that were true.

58
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,173
Uh, that's hairspray.
Your water bottle's by the door.

59
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,258
Yeah, I'll probably need it.

60
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,347
Remember, do your best.

61
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,891
I have to head to the city,
but I'll be back before dinner.

62
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,309
Your dad should be home soon.

63
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,268
Love you.

64
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,980
- Three, two...
- Forgot the purse.

65
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,358
And, Jonathan...

66
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,944
No looking for birthday presents
while I'm gone.

67
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,280
Mm-hmm.

68
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,531
Fine.

69
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,007
Bingo!

70
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,263
Ugh!

71
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,390
Cosplay?

72
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,274
Oh, too easy.

73
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:52,533
Don't look inside, Jon.
You don't want to ruin the surprise.

74
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,244
- But then again...
- Jonathan!

75
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,579
Dad's home.

76
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,132
Dad!

77
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,386
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, how was your trip?

78
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,138
Good. Interesting.

79
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,516
The scientists have discovered
this strange phenomenon

80
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,851
with certain types of ants.

81
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,520
Normally, they follow
the queen ant's directions,

82
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,148
but now, they're moving
of their own accord.

83
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,400
Which is better than
if the queen ant was dead,

84
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,987
because if the queen ant dies,
then so does the colony.

85
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,530
Sounds amazing.

86
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,491
Sorry I'm boring you with nerd talk.

87
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,786
Now, if you're done looking
for presents in the house...

88
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,205
What? Me? No, I would never.

89
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,999
How about you help me
with a few of the chores

90
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,126
that seem to have been neglected
while I was away?

91
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:26,919
Hey.

92
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,257
Now you've done it!

93
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,551
Come here.

94
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,720
Whoa.

95
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:44,269
Hmm.

96
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,064
Where could he be?

97
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:49,399
Gotcha!

98
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:04,998
- Dad?
- Yeah?

99
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,126
I know that you and Mom
think that your job is super important,

100
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,838
and it is, and everything,
but I don't know.

101
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,674
I... I miss having you around.

102
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,010
Yeah, I miss being around.

103
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,056
Son, someday, this will make sense,

104
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,977
but being a reporter,
it's a big responsibility.

105
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:26,687
- It's...
- The fourth estate.

106
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,064
Yeah, yeah. Mom gave me the whole spiel.

107
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,483
It sounds like fake news to me.

108
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,611
I mean, you've been gone
for two weeks, for what?

109
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,905
Just to find out why
ants are going crazy?

110
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,991
Well, it's really fascinating.
They actually...

111
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,076
Yeah, I'm sure. I just...

112
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,289
Couldn't you, I don't know,
look it up on the Internet?

113
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,457
If I didn't have to go, I wouldn't.

114
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,293
You need to believe me, son.

115
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:54,214
But jobs, especially mine,
involve some sacrifice.

116
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,092
Come on, it's not like
you're putting your life on the line.

117
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,303
You're just putting your name
on a byline.

118
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,680
You'd be surprised.

119
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,147
But you'll be here tomorrow, right?

120
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,398
For your game?

121
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,985
Or your birthday?

122
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,112
I thought maybe you forgot.

123
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:21,575
Jonathan, you are the most important
thing that has ever happened to me.

124
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,744
I'll never forget about you.

125
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,496
Wow! Look at that one!

126
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,502
Yeah, that's... You know what, kid?

127
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:35,297
I think your mom just got back.
You better wash up for dinner.

128
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,300
Uh, where are you going?

129
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,761
I just realized
I have a quick errand to run.

130
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,095
Tell your mom I'll be back later.

131
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,096
Uh...

132
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,265
- Sure.
- And Jonathan...

133
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:46,975
Happy birthday.

134
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:48,936
Thanks, Dad.

135
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,706
Superman to Watchtower.
Everyone all right?

136
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,751
Everything's fine. We were hit by
some sort of space debris.

137
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,670
<i>Looks like you closed it up,</i>

138
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,422
<i>- but if you want to come in...</i>
- No time.

139
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,132
A tsunami is about to hit Japan.

140
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,843
Contact Batman.
Let him know the damage assessment.

141
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,387
He's into that sort of thing.

142
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,598
And then there was one.

143
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,940
<i>Now batting, Jonathan Kent!</i>

144
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,942
Yeah!

145
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,070
Come on, Jon! You got this!

146
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,529
Whoo!

147
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,786
Oh, look. It's Can't Hit Kent.

148
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:13,121
We might as well start packing up
and head home

149
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:15,332
because this game's as good as over.

150
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,839
Strike one!

151
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:30,388
Strike two!

152
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,279
Come on, Jon, you got this.

153
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,883
Strike three, you're out!

154
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,719
Good job, Jonathan Can't!

155
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,391
You'll get them next time, kiddo.

156
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,644
Now, how about
we go celebrate your birthday?

157
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,021
Jonathan?

158
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,982
I just want to go home, Mom.

159
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,783
How is he?

160
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:33,869
Upset.

161
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,620
You said you were gonna be there.

162
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,540
- I know, but there was...
- Hey, you don't need to tell me.

163
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,084
Remember how many dates
you had to leave in the middle of

164
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,044
because of an "emergency"?

165
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,630
The world needs you, I get it.

166
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,675
But... he needs you, too.

167
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,053
- I know.
- He's getting older.

168
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:56,725
Maybe... Maybe it's time for the "talk."

169
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,983
Jon? It's Dad. Can I come in?

170
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,193
No!

171
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,987
I know you're upset,

172
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,072
- but work was...
- Work is important.

173
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:12,324
Yeah. You've told me.

174
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,951
I just didn't think that it was
more important than your word.

175
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,287
Look, I'm sorry.

176
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,206
- I...
- I don't care that you're sorry.

177
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,916
I just want you to be here!

178
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,294
You care more about your dumb job
than you do your own son!

179
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,963
Jon, it's not like that.

180
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,507
Listen, let's talk this out.

181
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,009
I'm coming in. Okay?

182
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,146
Jonathan? Son?

183
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,732
Leave me alone.

184
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,860
I'm your father.
I can't leave you alone.

185
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,862
Sorry, kid, it's in the contract.

186
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:37,909
No, seriously, Dad. Something is...
Something's wrong with me.

187
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,162
- I'm a freak.
- No, you're not a freak.

188
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,790
You're no more a freak than I am.

189
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,794
Dad, you just...
You wouldn't understand.

190
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,212
Oh...

191
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,006
I might.

192
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,181
My dad is Superman?

193
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,559
Like, the Superman?

194
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:06,938
This is the best birthday ever!

195
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,899
Was it just the heat vision
or was there something else?

196
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,110
I don't know.

197
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,486
Does he have X-ray vision?

198
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,780
If he has X-ray vision,
we can't send him to school.

199
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:16,823
You know that, right?

200
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,533
I think it's just the heat vision.

201
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,578
You think?
We need to know, Clark, this is serious.

202
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,663
So that means
that I'm a superhero, too, right?

203
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:26,082
Like, does that... does that mean I get
to join the Justice League and stuff?

204
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,752
Do I get to meet Batman?

205
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:30,587
What are we gonna do?

206
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,757
We knew this was a possibility.
I just...

207
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,301
He wasn't lifting cars at two years old
like you were.

208
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,263
So, I thought maybe
it skipped a generation, like, red hair.

209
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:43,350
Don't worry, I'll get him checked out.
We'll see what's happening.

210
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,185
It'll be fine.

211
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,442
Nope. Can't fly.

212
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,778
Mostly fine.

213
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,532
Woo-hoo!

214
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,076
Yeah!

215
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,420
Woo-hoo!

216
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,047
Oh, yeah!

217
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,206
Whoa.

218
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:53,795
Yeah!

219
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,049
Woo-hoo!

220
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,064
Mom? Mom!

221
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,316
What, honey?

222
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,446
Superman is out the window
and he has some kid hanging on his back.

223
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:29,247
Yeah, you know what? I was wrong.

224
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,541
Here's my phone. Have some fun.

225
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,508
This is amazing!

226
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,927
My favorite part of being an alien.

227
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,930
So, you're... Okay. So...

228
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,392
That means that I'm half alien, too,
right?

229
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,435
I'm half alien.

230
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,145
I'm half alien!

231
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:54,856
I'm half alien!

232
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,276
You're taking this a lot better
than I thought you would.

233
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,779
Why wouldn't I? I mean, this...

234
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:05,950
My dad is the greatest superhero
in the world.

235
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,452
Besides Batman.

236
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,205
It's pretty much
the greatest birthday present ever.

237
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,957
Yeah. It's been really hard
not to tell you,

238
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,419
but keeping you and your mother safe
is my top priority.

239
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,005
That means being on call.

240
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,842
My job, my real job
is helping the world.

241
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,803
Standing for truth, justice
and the American way,

242
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:27,263
wherever that takes me.

243
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:28,681
Awesome.

244
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:32,769
Sometimes. But as glamorous
as you might think this is,

245
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,355
it takes me away from you
and your mother.

246
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,107
And you should know it's dangerous.

247
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,109
It's a real sacrifice.

248
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,778
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

249
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,488
Oh, what should I be called though?

250
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:46,115
What about... What about...
Well, Super boy's taken, right?

251
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:51,120
So, what about, uh, Dragon eyes,
but with a "Z," or Supremo?

252
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:54,082
Or, uh, Kid Wonder!

253
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,044
Superman Two or...
Ugh! What's that smell?

254
00:22:58,586 --> 00:22:59,754
Gotham City.

255
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,260
This is Gotham?

256
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,595
I thought the Internet was exaggerating.

257
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,890
But why doesn't somebody
do something about this?

258
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,267
Somebody is.

259
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,655
Get him!

260
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,832
- Uh, Dad, shouldn't we help him?
- No.

261
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,960
He tends to get a bit grumpy
when I step in.

262
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,007
Is he always this... Oh!

263
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,509
Rough? It's not as bad as it looks.

264
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,803
He's actually going pretty easy on them.

265
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:53,933
That's easy?

266
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,352
This is my town, Batman.

267
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:02,567
Hey.

268
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,410
Aw...

269
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,663
Come on, Batman.
Let's come to an agreement, huh?

270
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:20,084
I'll promise to be a good bird
and you let me fly the coop, eh?

271
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,546
Okay.

272
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,965
No way!

273
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:37,060
Clark.

274
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,524
Hey, a little help here?

275
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,278
You... You... You're...

276
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,529
I'm Batman.

277
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,490
Wow!

278
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,123
This is the... Wow!

279
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,876
- This is the...
- Welcome to the Batcave.

280
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,097
Look! That's the Batmobile,

281
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,099
and the Batcomputer,

282
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,017
and the Batdinosaur. And that...

283
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,061
Who's the new kid? Obvious Boy?

284
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,110
Jon, this is Batman's son, Damian.

285
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,111
Jon?

286
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,530
So, you have toilet powers?

287
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,741
Relax, Damian. They're friends.

288
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,119
Sure. Friends.

289
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,915
So should I go into your utility belt
and get the you-know-what-a-nite?

290
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,209
Damian, please. They need our help.

291
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:44,919
Set up Jon in the Meta Analyzer.

292
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,840
Don't you mean the Bat Meta Analyzer?

293
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,885
Sorry. Sorry. I just thought...
Never mind.

294
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:56,055
Fine. Follow me, farm boy.

295
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,809
- Is that a giant penny?
- Don't touch the penny.

296
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,519
In fact, don't touch anything.

297
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,279
- Reminds me of us when we first met.
- I was nicer.

298
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,030
How's he doing?

299
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,074
I mean, now that he's living with you.

300
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:17,827
He wants to be good, I think.

301
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:20,163
But what Ra's
and Talia put him through...

302
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:21,956
Give it time.

303
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,250
No one ever said parenting
would be easy.

304
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,753
Especially when they've
been through so much.

305
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,880
Thanks. I hope so.

306
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,309
- He's done.
- Well?

307
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:43,060
Nothing definitive.

308
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,356
I have no idea what powers
could manifest next, if any at all.

309
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:50,693
If his first power set
was brought on by extreme stress,

310
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:51,819
it stands to reason

311
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:53,154
that another traumatic moment...

312
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,781
...might unlock something else.

313
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,491
Let's test that theory.

314
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,286
Damian!

315
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,430
What was that? Are you kidding me?

316
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,224
- You piece of...
- What?

317
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:24,685
You said a traumatic moment
might help him unlock some more powers.

318
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:25,937
Seems logical to test it out.

319
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,939
Not by trying to kill him.

320
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,442
If I wanted to do that,
he'd already be dead.

321
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,401
That's enough.

322
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:33,569
Who is this kid?

323
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:34,612
Ow!

324
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,114
Out. Now!

325
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,950
Well, he's obviously not invulnerable.

326
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,285
Obviously.

327
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,330
I'm sorry.

328
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,499
It's okay. He's had a tough time.

329
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,584
He's had a tough time?

330
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,921
Jonathan, could I borrow your dad
for a minute?

331
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,090
Yeah. Oh, yeah, of course.
Sure, sure, sure.

332
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,593
I'll just be over here,
you know, nursing my bat wounds.

333
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,804
Have you heard
from the Watchtower lately?

334
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,430
Green Arrow hasn't checked in?

335
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:03,349
He said he'd give you updates
after last night.

336
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,684
Last night?

337
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,103
The Watchtower,
it was knocked out of orbit.

338
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,939
I was able to right it
before heading to Japan for the tsunami.

339
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,234
I told Green Arrow to check in with you,
give updates.

340
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,194
I haven't been able
to raise them on comms.

341
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:16,529
I'm suspicious.

342
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,406
Well, that's not unusual for you.

343
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,032
Try them again.

344
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,961
So, where should we meet for patrol?

345
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,754
<i>No patrol tonight.</i>

346
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:36,090
<i>We've been called up to the Watchtower
for some emergency.</i>

347
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:39,886
- Great. I'll head to the tower and...
<i>- Damian. Damian...</i>

348
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:45,391
<i>Only the Titans have been called
to the Watchtower, and well...</i>

349
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,103
<i>You've never officially been inducted,
so...</i>

350
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,396
An oversight, I'm sure.

351
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,815
I'll head over,
swear on whatever you have handy and...

352
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,567
<i>No! No.</i>

353
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,696
<i>Damian, we've taken a vote.</i>

354
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:00,740
<i>We don't want you on the team.</i>

355
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,411
<i>You're just too violent,</i>

356
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,955
<i>and don't do well with others.</i>

357
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,958
<i>We are a team. We need to work as one,</i>

358
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,294
<i>and I'm sorry to say this,</i>

359
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,714
<i>but you don't care for anyone
but yourself.</i>

360
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,593
<i>- Sorry.</i>
- Sorry? Don't be sorry.

361
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,261
The only reason I've come around

362
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,805
is 'cause my father, Batman,
begged me to.

363
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,643
And why would I want to hang out with a
bunch of Justice League wannabes anyway?

364
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,771
<i>- Damian, I'm just...</i>
- Good luck on failing without me.

365
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,490
Uh...

366
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,367
Hey, I was wondering if you could
show me...

367
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:47,995
You have a cow?

368
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:50,331
Of course I have a cow.

369
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,293
When was the last time you milked her?

370
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:56,796
Milked her?

371
00:29:56,879 --> 00:30:00,424
Yeah. You have to milk it, it's a cow.

372
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,177
Listen, I can milk her, dude.
It's fine, it's no problem.

373
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,679
Over my dead body.

374
00:30:04,762 --> 00:30:08,808
I don't need some small town hick
telling me how to take care of a cow.

375
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,602
I'm the grandson of the Demon's Head.

376
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,397
I've killed more people
than you'll ever meet.

377
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,733
So leave my cow and my cave alone!

378
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,241
Hey, don't look at me, he's your friend.

379
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,619
Green Arrow, is that you?

380
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,579
<i>Yes. Sorry.</i>

381
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,498
<i>We're having trouble with the comms.</i>

382
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,501
<i>Whatever hit the Watchtower,
knocked out a couple of transmitters,</i>

383
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,961
<i>but we're almost up and running.</i>

384
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:39,422
Understood. Keep me updated
as to your progress.

385
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,799
<i>Of course, Batman. Watchtower out.</i>

386
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,052
- Something's off.
- Something's off.

387
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,847
Let me drop Jonathan at home
and we'll head to the Watchtower,

388
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,432
see what's really going on.

389
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:51,600
Hey, Dad.

390
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,394
- Hey. Ready to go?
- Yep.

391
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,065
Uh, Mr. Batman,
you have an awesome cave.

392
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,525
It was really great to meet you.

393
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,235
Oh! And, uh, here.

394
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,076
How did it go?

395
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:10,786
As well as can be expected.

396
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,538
Mom, I met Batman!

397
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,206
He's so...

398
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,252
- Uh, broody?
- No, I was gonna say cool.

399
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,379
All right, kiddo, time for bed.

400
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,549
But, Dad, we should go on patrol, right?

401
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,554
I mean, you never know
what bad guys are up to in Smallville.

402
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:31,432
Then lucky them,
because you need some sleep.

403
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,059
You have school tomorrow.

404
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:41,984
I'm leaving a present
on your nightstand.

405
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:45,029
It'll help you on your first step
to being a superhero.

406
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,405
Thanks, Dad.

407
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,074
I love you guys.

408
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:50,367
- Good night.
- Love you, too.

409
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:51,869
Good night.

410
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,415
I have to go back out.

411
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,751
Something strange is going on
at the Watchtower.

412
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,670
- It's the night for that, I suppose.
- What do you mean?

413
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:03,005
I've been getting these wild tips

414
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,508
from contacts all throughout
Central and South America.

415
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,593
The crime rate has plummeted.

416
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,303
Well, that's good, right?

417
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,222
You would think.
But when I say "plummeted,"

418
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,933
I mean, there's no more crime.

419
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,227
Not even a purse snatching
being reported.

420
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,853
We should go investigate.

421
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:19,730
I'll go get my cape.

422
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,986
- We did good.
- Yeah, we sure did.

423
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:44,380
Watchtower.
Batman, security code 0X-11 docking.

424
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,742
It's quiet.

425
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,578
- Let's do a full sweep.
- On it.

426
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,960
We have to get out of here. Now!

427
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,516
Some present.

428
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,023
So that's why you couldn't hit anything.

429
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:45,983
You're blind.

430
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:47,943
Whatever, Melvin.

431
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,071
Listen, Can't See Kent,

432
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,867
I think you need to apologize
for losing our game.

433
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,703
"Our game"? You aren't even on our team.

434
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,580
Ooh!

435
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,333
I could be on the team if I wanted to.

436
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:07,796
But only nerds with good grades
are allowed to play, and I'm no nerd.

437
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,089
Yeah.

438
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,508
Wait. I'm on the team.

439
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:14,136
Shut it, Kenny. You know what?

440
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:17,097
Maybe I'll just make Jonathan here
do my homework,

441
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:20,517
and then I'll join the team
and we'll never lose again.

442
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,394
In your dreams.

443
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,607
Oh!

444
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,906
Super-strength.

445
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,700
You okay, Melvin?

446
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,953
Of course I'm okay.

447
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,621
I must have tripped.

448
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:45,793
Like I said, how about an apology?

449
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,921
Only when your mom
apologizes for your face.

450
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,759
Did you just... Did you...

451
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,719
You're in for it now, Kent!

452
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,013
Do your worst, Melvin, the moron.

453
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,729
Who needs the Teen Titans?

454
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,023
Teen Titans.

455
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,900
Stupid name anyway.

456
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,527
I'll make my own team.

457
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,488
Yeah, maybe we'll even lead an assault
on Titans Tower.

458
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,907
Show them how well we can work together.

459
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,428
You tried to sneak up on me?

460
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,680
My mother taught me
how to avoid that in the crib.

461
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,310
Father, are you, okay?

462
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,540
What the...

463
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:47,081
Father, don't make me hurt you.

464
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,791
It is time.

465
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,765
Father, please, snap out of it.

466
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,152
<i>The southern hemisphere
has been taken over.</i>

467
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,113
<i>We'll be at the tipping point soon,</i>

468
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:21,281
<i>and this planet will be ours.</i>

469
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,616
And the others?

470
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,284
<i>They've been taken care of.</i>

471
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,412
<i>All threats have been infected.</i>

472
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:29,748
<i>- It is time.</i>
- It is time.

473
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,153
They've all been infected.

474
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:01,572
No one's left, but...

475
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,076
Oh, really?

476
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,122
Yes, yes, I'll save him, okay?

477
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:11,999
But only 'cause you asked.

478
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,002
Honestly, Jonathan,
I expect more from you.

479
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,337
And I'm sure your mother
and father do, too.

480
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:20,382
- But Melvin...
- You know Melvin has issues.

481
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,343
People like that need
more sympathy and patience.

482
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:26,513
And maybe, if you have the heart,
they deserve friendship.

483
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,557
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

484
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:31,894
People like Melvin, they're hurt.
They lash out.

485
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,062
But you take the time
to get to know them,

486
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,607
well, they'll be the most loyal friend
you'll ever know.

487
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,525
Thanks, but no thanks.

488
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:39,860
Just think about it.

489
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:42,821
Now, if you were any other kid,
you'd be suspended.

490
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,908
But a sit is, I put in a call
to your mother and she said,

491
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:49,453
and I quote, "I'll be there
to make sure he never does that again."

492
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,622
I hope you learned your lesson,
young man.

493
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,290
Yeah, um,

494
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:56,627
you know what, Principal Cunningham,
you're right, lesson learned.

495
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,879
You really are amazing at your job.

496
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,507
I promise, no more trouble from me.

497
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,594
Damn, I am good at my job.

498
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,101
Really? Isn't that a little obvious?

499
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:16,021
I was actually a fan before I found out.

500
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:19,191
You know who was my...
You know what? It doesn't matter.

501
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:20,317
What are you doing here?

502
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,069
Aliens are taking over the globe.

503
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,403
Come on, farm boy.

504
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,907
- We've got to go save our dads.
- What? How?

505
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,951
- What happened to your face?
- Uh...

506
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,286
Actually, another power
kicked in today, so...

507
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,496
It was super-strength.

508
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,791
But evidently, super-strength doesn't
mean invulnerability to punches, so...

509
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,251
So you punched yourself?

510
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,629
Just please stay on point.
What is this about aliens?

511
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,548
That's right, you're a little slow.

512
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,800
Okay, one more time. Batman showed up,

513
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,969
tried to stick
some parasitic organism on me.

514
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:48,679
I saw that you were next on the list.

515
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,473
So here I am. I've just saved you.
You're welcome.

516
00:39:51,557 --> 00:39:53,809
Look at this.

517
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,104
You hanging out with cosplay losers now?

518
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,899
Oh, he hit you.

519
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,318
Yeah, I did.

520
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,320
Should have used your heat vision,
honestly.

521
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:09,116
Listen, kid, I know he's annoying,
but we have no time to interact with you

522
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,033
Oh.

523
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:11,660
You'll make time.

524
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:12,911
Ooh.

525
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,374
What did you do?

526
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,751
Paralyzing technique
I learned from my grandfather.

527
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:22,754
- He should recover, in about a week.
- A week?

528
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:24,256
Jonathan.

529
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:27,509
Jonathan.

530
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,136
It's time to go home.

531
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,184
- She's compromised.
- Oh, my mom never compromises.

532
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,437
She's been taken over, idiot.

533
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,564
What? No. No! She's fine.

534
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,735
I've been around the block, Kent.

535
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,570
I know when someone's
being mind controlled.

536
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,822
- Shut up.
- What, you don't believe me?

537
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:51,742
- Test her then.
- Okay, fine.

538
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,285
I'll test her.

539
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,911
Hi, Mom. Uh...

540
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:57,080
When we get home, can I play video games

541
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,166
and maybe break into that tub
of ice cream

542
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:00,917
you try to hide from me in the freezer?

543
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,919
Mm.

544
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:06,256
Of course, dear.
That sounds like a marvelous idea.

545
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,550
Now, come over here and give me a hug.

546
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,553
- Yeah, she's been taken over.
- Told you.

547
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:12,763
Jonathan,

548
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,515
I said come over here and give me a hug.

549
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:17,517
It is time.

550
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:18,894
It is time.

551
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:20,187
It is time.

552
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:21,688
It is time.

553
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,281
She's right behind us!

554
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:36,912
Get in!

555
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:54,137
- Do something.
- I am doing something.

556
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,347
I'm trying to fly away.

557
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,640
You do something.

558
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,850
You have heat vision.
Just kill her already.

559
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,769
I am not gonna kill my mom!

560
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,447
Oh, there! The pond!
Can you get us over there?

561
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,666
Sorry, Mom.

562
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:33,760
You think she's okay?

563
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,387
Yeah, she's fine. Great job.

564
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,055
Uh, maybe we should...

565
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:51,570
Jonathan.

566
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,704
We need to lay low,
examine the alien for weaknesses.

567
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,915
And how are we going to do that?
You have an alien handy?

568
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,586
- Actually...
- All right.

569
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:10,630
So, S.T.A.R. Labs maybe? Kord Tech?

570
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,966
No, no. They'll be compromised.

571
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,259
Okay, then where?

572
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,802
I have an idea.

573
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:28,982
Come on, lift with your knees.

574
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,654
I'm kind of new
to this super-strength thing.

575
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:35,781
Just give me a minute.

576
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,326
Sure. Every minute we waste here,

577
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,286
the world is being overrun
by murderous starfish,

578
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,704
but take your time.

579
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,500
- What?
- Take your time! You're doing great!

580
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:49,169
Okay, okay, okay!
I got it! I got it! I got it!

581
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,387
Yes! Oh, did you see that?

582
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,640
Who's the man? I'm the man.

583
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,600
Who's the man? I'm the man.

584
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,561
Great job. Now you just have to turn it.

585
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:15,237
That's it?

586
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:18,782
My father said Superman kept
his most prized possessions here.

587
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,743
And all it takes to get in
is a large key?

588
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:26,248
So, I guess super-intellect
is not one of his powers.

589
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,584
What was that?

590
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,545
Probably just the ice,

591
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,713
you know, melting.

592
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,010
Is that a dog?

593
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:49,396
Your dad has a super-dog? Why didn't he
tell you he has a super-dog?

594
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:53,149
Questions I'm gonna ask later.

595
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:11,918
I got it!

596
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:25,724
Come on!

597
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,232
Which way?

598
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,360
How should I know?
I've never been here before.

599
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:19,819
Then why did we come here?

600
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:30,830
What?

601
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,254
Heel!

602
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,223
And I thought the Batcave was weird.

603
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:53,853
Krypto. Don't you know who this is?

604
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:57,148
This is Kal-El's son, Jonathan.

605
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,528
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Good boy.

606
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:03,321
How did you know who I was?

607
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,949
A cursory glance at your DNA.

608
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,243
What are you, some kind of ghost?

609
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:13,498
No. I am the artificial embodiment
of Jonathan's grandfather, Jor-El.

610
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,375
I, along with Krypto,

611
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,585
are the guardians
of the Fortress of Solitude.

612
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,629
My grandfather?

613
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:24,426
Yes. You are from a long line
of heroes and scientists.

614
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,928
The house of El lives in you now.

615
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:31,766
It's important that you understand
who you are and where you've come from.

616
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,770
Embedded in the crystals before you
is the total accumulation

617
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:39,733
of all literature and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds

618
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:42,193
spanning the 28 known galaxies.

619
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,529
Yeah, sorry, old timer.
Maybe another time.

620
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:46,573
Right now, we got bigger problems.

621
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,367
Is there any way you can scan this,
tell us what it is?

622
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:04,257
Yes, that is a spore
from the alien known as Starro.

623
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,550
"Starro"?

624
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:08,511
A parasitic creature
that can produce millions of spores.

625
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,264
These spores,
such as you have in your vial,

626
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,017
are then deposited
onto an unsuspecting planet,

627
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,935
taking control of its populace,

628
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:18,188
effectively controlling the planet

629
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:21,775
until the Hive Mind
can then drain it of life unabated.

630
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,151
"Hive Mind"?

631
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,236
Like a queen ant?

632
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,030
Similar. Yes.

633
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,449
- What are you prattling on about?
- My dad.

634
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:32,744
He said that a bunch of hive-controlled
insects were going crazy.

635
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:35,497
They must have been reacting
to the presence of the Hive Mind.

636
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:40,168
Which means, just like the queen ant,

637
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:42,003
if we can take out the Hive Mind,

638
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,546
- then the spores will just...
- Die.

639
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:44,881
Huh.

640
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:45,965
Impressive.

641
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:47,801
More likely just lucky.

642
00:48:47,884 --> 00:48:49,052
Mm-hmm.

643
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:50,845
So, how do we Kill it?

644
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:52,013
Unknown.

645
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,308
My biological counterpart
had just acquired the specimen

646
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,185
before Krypton was destroyed.

647
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,312
What good are you?

648
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,439
Can you at least tell us
where this thing is?

649
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,776
I'm sorry. That is beyond my capability.

650
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:06,152
Great.

651
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:09,948
You know, my mom told me
that in order to figure out a story,

652
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:11,699
you have to start from the beginning.

653
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,203
- When did these spores start showing up?
- I know this.

654
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,747
After you came to visit us
at the Batcave,

655
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,499
my father and your dad
went to investigate

656
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,084
some problem at the Watchtower.

657
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:24,087
Something had hit it the night before,
knocking out their communications.

658
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,131
They thought it was
some random space debris.

659
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,049
But odds are...

660
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,218
- It was the Hive Mind!
- It was the Hive Mind.

661
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,012
- So that means...
- We have to go to space.

662
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:35,890
We have to go to space!

663
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,088
Miss Lane! Miss Lane!

664
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:08,923
Mr. White's been trying
to get a hold of you.

665
00:50:09,007 --> 00:50:11,301
Some sort of global pandemic
has hit the southern states

666
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,052
and he wants you at the front line to...

667
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,266
- Open your mouth.
- What?

668
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,894
Jimmy, open your mouth.

669
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,195
Uh...

670
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:33,907
- Are you okay, Miss Lane?
- No, none of us are.

671
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,243
Jimmy, there are aliens.
They reach into your...

672
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,831
Jimmy, my son is out there.

673
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,667
I know he's in the middle of this,
and I need to help him.

674
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,253
I thought maybe I could
slip onto the mid-day program,

675
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:50,548
warn people, but...
I don't know who's been taken over.

676
00:50:50,632 --> 00:50:53,134
Aliens? Well, you mean, like...
You mean, like Superman?

677
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,386
No, nothing like him.

678
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:59,390
I think I know how to stop them,
or hurt them anyway.

679
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:02,936
I just... We have to figure out a way
to tell everyone.

680
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:04,062
Get the word out.

681
00:51:04,187 --> 00:51:05,438
Oh. Gee, Miss Lane.

682
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:08,483
The only way you could do that
is if you were the president.

683
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,277
He's allowed to break into broadcasts
in the case of emergencies,

684
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:14,322
- but, um, seeing as how...
- Jimmy, you're a genius.

685
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:17,784
Shucks, Miss Lane.

686
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,581
It's a little cramped.

687
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,669
That is because
my biological counterpart

688
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:30,213
made the ship for your father
when he was but a baby.

689
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:32,674
- I toiled for years when...
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.

690
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,593
Your grandfather likes to monologue
almost as much as mine.

691
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,929
All right, let's do this thing.

692
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:40,306
Wait. There's something in my back.

693
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:42,433
Sweet.

694
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,144
- Is that a blanket?
- Not anymore.

695
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:49,649
Well, what do you think?

696
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:53,319
It looks... completely stupid.

697
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,613
- Ready?
- Ready.

698
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,879
Yes, you are right.

699
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:14,549
Their odds of survival are not good.

700
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:16,384
Not good at all.

701
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,573
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

702
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:43,536
Where's this Watchtower thing?

703
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:45,330
Right there.

704
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,548
What if they see us?

705
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:58,051
Jor-El said the rocket
has a built-in stealth function.

706
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:00,094
We shouldn't show up on any radar.

707
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:05,350
Now, with a few codes
I hacked from the Bat-computer...

708
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:23,326
Okay, so we're just
gonna go in there, and what?

709
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,371
What do you think?
We sneak in, kill this Hive Mind thing

710
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,206
and be back
for Alfred's cucumber sandwiches.

711
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,875
Which, to be honest,
are not as bad as they sound.

712
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,335
All right, be careful.

713
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:36,089
Careful? Please.
I'm a trained assassin.

714
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:46,182
What? What is it?

715
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,266
We're in deep...

716
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:53,314
I wouldn't have come if it wasn't
an emergency, Mr. President.

717
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:57,944
Despite our differences,
you're the only one that could help.

718
00:53:58,611 --> 00:53:59,570
I believe...

719
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:04,283
I know that aliens
are taking over the world,

720
00:54:04,659 --> 00:54:07,995
and I need you to make
a public address warning everyone.

721
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:11,916
For you, Lois, anything.

722
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:13,960
She's clean.

723
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,712
Nothing except some hair stuff,
hand sanitizer,

724
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:19,924
vegan granola bar
and a cigarette lighter.

725
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,302
I quit.

726
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:24,971
It's just there to remind me.

727
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,265
And I'd like to remind you

728
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:30,685
that I've been saying
this day would come for some time.

729
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,481
You've written op-ed after op-ed
about my paranoia

730
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:39,068
with regards to extraterrestrials
and now...

731
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,154
With regards to Superman.

732
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:44,198
- Listen, if you don't want...
- Of course, I want to help.

733
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:46,409
That's all I've ever wanted to do.

734
00:54:46,993 --> 00:54:48,369
But, in return...

735
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,788
What?

736
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:52,373
A front page apology

737
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:55,501
and endorsement by you
in the next election.

738
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:57,962
Well, now I know
you're definitely not infected.

739
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:58,963
Why is that?

740
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:01,591
Because you're only concerned
about yourself.

741
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,342
Do we have a deal?

742
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,264
Deal.

743
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:16,272
Can't you, I don't know,
use your heat vision or something?

744
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:17,356
Then what?

745
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,524
Silence!

746
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:24,780
You have sought to thwart my plans.

747
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:28,784
But Starro cannot be defeated.

748
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:32,205
It is time.

749
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:36,375
As long as there are free human beings,
you'll never stand a chance.

750
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,336
You should be grateful.

751
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,089
Your kind was destroying the planet.

752
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,343
Now, there is no crime,

753
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:49,639
no poverty, no rich, no poor,

754
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:53,309
no more destruction of the environment.

755
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:55,394
At the cost of our free will,

756
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,522
and until you suck it dry for yourself.

757
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,940
Correct.

758
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:04,654
And then I'll move to the next planet,
and the next.

759
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:08,157
With the technology
that you've accumulated,

760
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:13,538
my kind will take over the universe.

761
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:18,584
And there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

762
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:26,467
Damian!

763
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:31,097
So, what about us?

764
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:34,016
Are we going to join
your starfish-headed goons?

765
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:37,895
No, you have offended me.

766
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,064
Kill them.

767
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,903
Don't do this! You're heroes!

768
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,324
It's okay, Jonathan.

769
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:53,202
I never liked this green cow led rip-off
of my dad's anyway.

770
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:56,163
Come on, Robin Hood. I'm right here.

771
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,392
No. No, no, no, no, no.

772
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:17,893
What did you do?

773
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,313
You idiot!
You can't even take a batarang.

774
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:24,066
What makes you think...
Stupid, stupid farm boy.

775
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:26,110
I was just beginning to like you.

776
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,321
Huh. Good.

777
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:35,828
- You're arrow proof?
- I'm arrow proof.

778
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,332
All right, Justice dweebs.

779
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:41,542
My friend here
is about to kick your ass.

780
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,805
I am so sorry, Wonder Girl! I...

781
00:58:16,494 --> 00:58:18,162
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

782
00:58:21,457 --> 00:58:24,835
<i>...we're faced with a crisis
of global proportions.</i>

783
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,879
<i>It's been brought to my attention</i>

784
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:31,467
<i>that an extraterrestrial being
has begun to take over our world.</i>

785
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:34,261
<i>I urge you to remain calm</i>

786
00:58:35,304 --> 00:58:37,515
<i>and allow yourself to be taken</i>

787
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:41,060
<i>by the almighty Starro.</i>

788
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,985
<i>It is time.</i>

789
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:16,262
It is time.

790
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:18,931
It's time for you to burn,
you son of a bitch!

791
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:20,975
Mom?

792
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,651
I'm an investigative reporter, asshole.

793
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,654
I knew you were taken over
the minute you took the meeting.

794
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:37,032
<i>Jonathan, I know you're out there.</i>

795
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,952
<i>I'm hoping, praying you can see this.</i>

796
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:43,456
<i>Heat can hurt this thing.
You hear me, Jonathan Kent?</i>

797
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:44,999
<i>Burn this mother...</i>

798
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,710
Mom, Mom!

799
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,756
Okay, so it doesn't like heat.

800
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:38,844
This is too easy.

801
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:58,572
About time.

802
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,115
Yeah, well, I was busy.

803
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,952
Turns out the Hive Mind
isn't a fan of heat.

804
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:08,290
It won't come off.

805
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,292
Even with super strength.

806
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,087
Then we need to take out the Hive Mind.

807
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:15,256
Maybe your heat vision could kill him.

808
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:16,382
Come on, let's go.

809
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,647
Dad!

810
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:31,165
Gotcha!

811
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,505
I will kill you, Father.

812
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,530
We need a new angle.

813
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:07,242
Angle. "Try a different angle."
Mom was right!

814
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,370
What if we trade partners?

815
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:10,829
Yeah, why not?

816
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,165
But first, I'll need something.

817
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,042
Help me tackle Batman.

818
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,203
That's okay. I got it.

819
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:52,746
What's that?

820
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,290
My dad's insurance policy.

821
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:45,132
Whoa!

822
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:55,768
Man of Steel?

823
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:31,261
I just knocked out Batman
with one punch!

824
01:05:31,345 --> 01:05:33,305
It is too late.

825
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:37,059
We are past the tipping point.

826
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:40,562
Your world is mine.

827
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,941
That's what you think.
Torch this thing, farm boy.

828
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,401
Useless.

829
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,458
I don't think your heat vision's
gonna cut it.

830
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:03,502
Yeah, I know, but I had to try.

831
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:06,672
- What now?
- Only one thing I can think of.

832
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,257
Yeah.

833
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:14,680
Okay. That's everyone that could fit.
Jon?

834
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,523
Sorry, Dad.

835
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,366
Ready.

836
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,801
- So...
- So...

837
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:55,971
We just have to make it to
the control center

838
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:57,764
and then drop this thing
in the atmosphere.

839
01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:00,684
While avoiding a malevolent Hive Mind
that wants us dead.

840
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:02,019
And that.

841
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,608
You know, my dad said being a hero
was about sacrifice.

842
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:11,653
And I don't think I believed him.

843
01:07:12,196 --> 01:07:13,322
But now?

844
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,991
The world needs Superman and Batman
a lot more than it needs

845
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:17,618
a farm boy from Kansas.

846
01:07:18,285 --> 01:07:19,786
Or an assassin with a cow.

847
01:07:20,162 --> 01:07:21,872
I don't know. He's pretty cool.

848
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,585
- Ready?
- Yeah, I am.

849
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:36,845
So, how do we knock this thing
out of orbit?

850
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:38,138
I don't know.

851
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:45,938
I got it!

852
01:08:05,332 --> 01:08:06,291
Damian!

853
01:08:18,804 --> 01:08:20,639
- Shoot it!
- What if I hit you?

854
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,600
It's better than being eaten
by this thing! Shoot it now!

855
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:32,317
No! You will not stop me!

856
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:35,612
It is my time! My time!

857
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,787
Hold on!

858
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:45,247
I can't!

859
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,457
Hold on!

860
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,035
No way!

861
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,830
The Hive Mind must be losing its power.

862
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:10,707
The boys!

863
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:16,671
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

864
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,527
You know, of all the ways to go,
definitely didn't see this one coming.

865
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,445
Ninjas, yes.

866
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,906
Joker, possibly.

867
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,952
Crashing to Earth on a satellite
while fighting off parasitic aliens,

868
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,412
not really on my radar.

869
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,289
Nice to know you can be surprised.

870
01:11:27,576 --> 01:11:28,952
Woo-hoo-hoo!

871
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:49,181
Dad!

872
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:52,017
You're all right!

873
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:55,729
I'm better than all right,
now that I know you're safe.

874
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:08,241
I, uh...

875
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,787
I was... worried.

876
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,333
Why? I learned from the best.

877
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:29,137
I'm proud of you, Jonathan.

878
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,682
You put the world, us, above yourself.

879
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,768
That's what a hero does.

880
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,104
That's what a Superman does.

881
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,660
I have survived the ravages of space!

882
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:54,663
Did you think you could destroy me?

883
01:12:56,915 --> 01:12:58,917
You are nothing.

884
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:02,796
You are...

885
01:13:11,346 --> 01:13:12,639
Jonathan, get ready!

886
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,629
I'd call that a home run.

887
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,009
<i>Hey, Damian. Listen,
we took another vote.</i>

888
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,468
- You did?
<i>- Yes.</i>

889
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:52,721
<i>After what you did on the Watchtower,</i>

890
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:55,015
<i>- saving us...</i>
- And the world.

891
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,224
<i>...and the world,</i>

892
01:13:56,808 --> 01:13:59,102
<i>we'd be honored
if you joined the Titans.</i>

893
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,356
<i>Did we get cut off?</i>

894
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,775
<i>Damian, can you hear me?</i>

895
01:14:05,859 --> 01:14:10,155
Oh, uh, I heard you. But you know what?
Uh, I have a prior engagement.

896
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:11,489
Let me get back to you on that.

897
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:13,074
<i>Get back to me on...</i>

898
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,744
You're enjoying this a bit too much.

899
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:17,746
It's the little things.

900
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:21,124
Come on. I don't want to be late.
Never been to a baseball game before.

901
01:14:22,584 --> 01:14:25,253
<i>Now batting, Jonathan Kent.</i>

902
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:34,763
Good luck, Can't Hit...

903
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,563
Knock 'em dead, kiddo!

904
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,904
- I thought you had an emergency.
- Barry's handling it.

905
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,949
Besides, I have more important things
to take care of.

906
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:59,079
Hit it like it's
an extraterrestrial parasitic monster!

907
01:15:33,738 --> 01:15:36,032
Go, go, go! Good job, Jonathan.

908
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,784
- You got it, buddy!
- Good job!

909
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:39,994
Keep going!

910
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,838
So, what now?

911
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:51,965
You think we should join
the Teen Titans?

912
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,425
Go on patrol?

913
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,844
I mean, what's next
for the new dynamic duo?

914
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:58,888
Nope. Dynamic Duo is Batman and Robin.

915
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:02,016
We're Super Sons.

916
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:04,477
Okay. Fine.

917
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:07,522
What's next for the Super Sons?

918
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:10,108
Well, I do owe you a birthday present.

919
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,401
Oh.

920
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,652
Well, what is it?

921
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:13,903
This.

922
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:18,950
Still can't fly.

922
01:16:19,305 --> 01:17:19,749
