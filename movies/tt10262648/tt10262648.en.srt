00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

2
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:47,741
"To escape, you need to firmly know
not where you are running, but from where."

3
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,455
Is it Pelevin?

4
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,803
Might be,
which book exactly?

5
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,335
<i>Life of the Insects</i>?
<i>Omon Ra</i>?

6
00:01:56,608 --> 00:01:58,190
Aim higher.

7
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:01,145
<i>Chapayev and Void</i>!

8
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:04,333
- Right?
- Yeah, right!

9
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:06,690
Have you read it?

10
00:02:06,787 --> 00:02:09,529
- What?
- <i>Chapayev and Void</i> by Pelevin.

11
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:12,319
Yes, I know about Pelevin,
but I haven't read it yet.

12
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:15,039
It's on my list.
Definitely.

13
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:18,784
- Next!
- Who's next?

14
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,528
My turn.

15
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:28,059
"Only parts of us will ever touch
only the parts of others."

16
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:31,083
- Wow!
- Right?

17
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:33,937
Yes? No? Don't know?

18
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:35,625
Anna Akhmatova?

19
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,375
Pretty close.

20
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,095
It's pronounced AkhmAtova.

21
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,719
Pretty, pretty, pretty close.

22
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:47,457
Now in original language.

23
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:53,936
"Only parts of us will ever touch
only the parts of others."

24
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:57,076
Yes? No? Don't know?

25
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,417
Marilyn Monroe.

26
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,324
PETROGLYPHS OF MURMANSK

27
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:03,244
Is everything okay?

28
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:05,031
Yes. Everything's okay.

29
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,971
Come, I want to introduce you
to my former professor.

30
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,399
Let's go.

31
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:26,250
I'll be right over.

32
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:39,285
Let me introduce
my Finnish friend to you.

33
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,686
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

34
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:45,315
She is leaving Moscow tomorrow

35
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:48,145
to the Murmansk Region
to see the petroglyphs.

36
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,042
That's really amazing.

37
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:54,251
Irina is talking
about etroglyphs all the time.

38
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:56,471
Not only me,
you were also impressed by them.

39
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:59,800
Yes, of course. I'm really excited

40
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:03,520
to go there and see the petroglyphs.

41
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:05,547
Do you study archeology?

42
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:08,570
No, but I'd like to.

43
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,555
I came here to study the language,

44
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,661
but then I met Irina, and...

45
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:18,856
It's a natural need. It's important
for us to know where we come from.

46
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:19,649
Yes.

47
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:23,810
It's easier to understand the present,
if you know the past. Right?

48
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,737
Right.

49
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,390
My friends!
My friends!

50
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:35,809
I'd like to raise a toast
to my lovely Finnish friend

51
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:41,636
who is traveling tomorrow far away
to the north, to the Arctic,

52
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:44,700
to see the petroglyphs. Hey!

53
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,935
Here's to you, my dear!

54
00:05:49,122 --> 00:05:52,581
May this journey
be unforgettable for you!

55
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,186
- Okay?
- Thanks.

56
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:55,214
Yay!

57
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,809
Let me take a picture of you all.

58
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,215
Sit down.
Come sit here.

59
00:06:00,285 --> 00:06:02,710
- Who is she?
- Irina's "lodger".

60
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,750
Sit down, please. Come on!

61
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:09,761
Three!

62
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:19,958
And now!

63
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,129
There!

64
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:23,896
Let's dance.

65
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:29,451
I am sorry... I had to cancel my trip.

66
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:33,365
But it was not my decision.

67
00:07:34,358 --> 00:07:35,695
It's okay.

68
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,708
Have your passports ready.

69
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:35,363
There's no rush.
I have all the time in the world.

70
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:39,350
I'm sorry, I do have a passport,
I put it here but...

71
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:42,838
Here!

72
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,110
You both are heading
to Murmansk.

73
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,736
No spitting on the floor,

74
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:58,280
no littering in the toilet.

75
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:00,953
Enjoy your journey!

76
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:03,970
Thanks.

77
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,208
Are you done?

78
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:02,792
No.

79
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:09,179
We're closing.

80
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,409
We're closing.

81
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,340
Hey!

82
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,787
I thought you would never come.

83
00:11:55,694 --> 00:11:57,021
What's wrong?

84
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,268
Is it your first time on train, huh?

85
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:07,701
No.

86
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,795
Hey!

87
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,405
Look! Hey!

88
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:16,059
Film it! Look at this snowstorm.

89
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,719
Come on! Hey!

90
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,592
Come here!

91
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,398
Get down here!

92
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:25,968
Come on!

93
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,375
You've got a camera.
Come on.

94
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:30,500
Come here, film it.

95
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:33,019
Down... Alright...

96
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,421
A fucking great snowstorm.

97
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,334
Come on, turn it on.

98
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,794
Look!

99
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:46,542
Wow!

100
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,452
Russia is a great country.

101
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:50,738
We...

102
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:54,087
We... beat the Nazis.

103
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:58,292
The Moon... We went there!

104
00:12:58,776 --> 00:13:01,677
You know... we... you know...

105
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:13,462
Listen... What do you...

106
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,238
What do you have in Estonia,
which we don't have here?

107
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:18,962
What?

108
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:20,520
Not a fuck!

109
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,201
How do you say--

110
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,879
- I'm from Finland.
- What?

111
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,678
- I'm from Finland.
- I don't give a fuck.

112
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,345
How do you say it in Finnish?

113
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,176
How do you say "Hi"?

114
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:35,635
How?

115
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:38,023
- It's "Hei".
- Hei!

116
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,738
Got it? Hei!

117
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,050
Hei!

118
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,437
"Hei" it is...

119
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,227
It's...

120
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:51,737
Bye!

121
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,250
I mean, "Bye". See you!

122
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,677
How do you say "Bye-bye", "Goodbye"?

123
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,564
- "Hei hei".
- Shit!

124
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:04,217
Fuck me!
Really? "Hei hei"?

125
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,164
This is like hei! Hei hei!

126
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:10,134
Shit. This sounds so stupid.

127
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:13,306
In Russian we have
many words for...

128
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,917
Snow!

129
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,735
Snowstorm!
And... blizzard!

130
00:14:23,165 --> 00:14:26,931
Whiteout, it's when...
Whiteout!

131
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,695
It's when...

132
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:31,203
How do you say... look...

133
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,925
How do you say...

134
00:14:37,258 --> 00:14:38,625
"I love you"?

135
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,209
It's "Haista vittu". [Fuck you]

136
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,517
- What?
- "Haista vittu". [Fuck you]

137
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,029
That's it!

138
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,277
Alright.

139
00:14:52,486 --> 00:14:53,917
You!

140
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,015
Haista vittu.

141
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,243
- Got it?
- Something like that.

142
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,542
Haista vittu.

143
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:07,197
So you got it? Alright.

144
00:15:08,927 --> 00:15:11,900
So tell me. What are you doing
on the train alone?

145
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:14,083
Selling your cunt?

146
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,500
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

147
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:22,910
I mean, pussy?

148
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:25,569
You're selling it?

149
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,684
You're... selling...

150
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:30,705
Your pussy?

151
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:31,919
Fuck!

152
00:15:32,321 --> 00:15:34,886
You-- Oh, shit! Fuck me! Ouch!

153
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,674
I can't stay there.
I can't sleep...

154
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,182
Can't you?

155
00:15:48,774 --> 00:15:50,722
You think you have a choice?

156
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,062
Are you serious?

157
00:16:27,868 --> 00:16:30,408
You break it,
then put it together.

158
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,250
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting yellow one in.

159
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:44,627
Excuse me, are these free?

160
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,093
No, both are taken.
They've gone to the dining car.

161
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:51,291
Don't you have a ticket?

162
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:47,764
St. Petersburg! Get up!

163
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:51,484
Get up! St. Petersburg!

164
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:12,986
Excuse me.

165
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,739
Excuse me.
When is the next train to Moscow?

166
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,540
In an hour.

167
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:23,140
Thanks.

168
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:31,646
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.</i>

169
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:33,352
<i>Oh, hi!</i>

170
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,519
<i>I'm in St. Petersburg.</i>

171
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,003
<i>In St. Pete's? Why?</i>

172
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,852
<i>Don't say you're coming back already?</i>

173
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,714
<i>Hello?</i>

174
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:50,094
No...

175
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,167
of course not.

176
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:54,833
It's just...

177
00:21:55,587 --> 00:22:00,009
The train stays here for a while,
and I saw a phone so...

178
00:22:00,113 --> 00:22:01,146
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

179
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:04,666
<i>I see. So how are you?
Lucky with your compartment mates?</i>

180
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,280
<i>They're on the table.</i>

181
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:08,734
Well, not exactly.
He's a bit weird.

182
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:11,772
<i>Just a second.</i>

183
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:14,208
You are never alone,
are you?

184
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:16,990
<i>What are you saying?</i>

185
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:19,400
<i>Hello?</i>

186
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,828
I have to get back on the train.

187
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:30,136
<i>I see. I have to go, too.
I'm glad you're fine.</i>

188
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:33,371
<i>Enjoy the trip, it'll be great!</i>

189
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,595
- Thank you.
<i>- Bye!</i>

190
00:22:56,175 --> 00:23:00,115
Hey, lad.
I told you the place was taken.

191
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,315
Come on, get down.

192
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,956
Here, have a tangerine.

193
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:54,462
You think I'm a thief?

194
00:23:54,609 --> 00:23:55,742
What?

195
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,944
Why did you take your backpack with you?
So that I wouldn't steal it?

196
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:05,990
No.

197
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:12,371
I just didn't plan...
to get back on the train.

198
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:19,920
So why did you?

199
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:16,297
Fuck!

200
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,251
- Here's your salad.
- Thank you.

201
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,798
Are you ready to order?

202
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:28,711
I'm fucking not.

203
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,170
You look so serious
all the time.

204
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,554
You'll get old too soon
and be all covered with wrinkles.

205
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:52,218
Thank you, I know.

206
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,011
Just saying...

207
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:06,732
So you're heading to Murmansk?

208
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:09,959
What for?

209
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,900
To sell my cunt.

210
00:26:15,612 --> 00:26:19,290
I'm going to see the petroglyphs.

211
00:26:21,035 --> 00:26:23,170
W-What are these...
petroglyphs?

212
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:26,131
Petroglyphs.

213
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,065
Rock paintings.

214
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:33,703
Not a clue. What are they?
What's so special about them?

215
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:39,033
They're... 10,000 years old.

216
00:26:41,047 --> 00:26:42,285
So what?

217
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:49,631
I study archeology at the university,
it's interesting to me.

218
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:55,320
So... you'll look at them,

219
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:57,966
these drawings,

220
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,731
and then what?

221
00:27:00,713 --> 00:27:05,439
Well, I think we have to know
where we come from.

222
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:10,710
Well, it's a natural need
for human beings.

223
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,721
It's easier to understand the present,
if you know the past.

224
00:27:27,115 --> 00:27:33,155
That means, you're taking this train,

225
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:35,936
fuck, to that shithole...

226
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:37,805
just to look...

227
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:39,938
Unbelievable.

228
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:42,960
Fuck...

229
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:47,842
And you? Why are you going there?

230
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,279
To work, for fuck's sake.

231
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,102
What's your job?

232
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,542
You've heard of Olenegorsk GOK?

233
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,529
What is GOK?

234
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,088
Well...

235
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:08,900
GOK is a mining and processing combine.

236
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:13,420
Shit. It's a huge mine.

237
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:15,775
You know.

238
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:18,620
Are you a builder?

239
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:27,369
Oh, screw it!
Okay, a builder.

240
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:30,414
You know, it's just
to make some dough.

241
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:32,870
I'm saving for my own bureau.

242
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,957
For a bureau?

243
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,904
Well... yeah... for an office.

244
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:43,181
For business.

245
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,597
What kind of business?

246
00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:50,823
Fuck. Just business.

247
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:03,855
So, do you have a boyfriend?

248
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:06,290
Yes.

249
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:07,670
What's his name?

250
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:09,920
What does it matter?

251
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:12,862
- Finnish?
- No, Russian.

252
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:15,015
And what does he do?

253
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,138
He is a progessor.

254
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:18,750
Of literature.

255
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,081
A professor...

256
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,774
- Excuse me, may we sit here?
- Yes. Sure.

257
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,621
- Who's sitting near the window?
- Me!

258
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,422
- Sit down.
- And you sit here.

259
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:35,168
- You're a foreigner, right?
- Yes, I'm from Finland.

260
00:29:36,282 --> 00:29:37,583
A tourist?

261
00:29:37,772 --> 00:29:39,703
No, I'm not a tourist.

262
00:29:40,901 --> 00:29:43,195
I'm studying archeology at
the Moscow University--

263
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,764
Excuse me,
is the salad good?

264
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:48,641
- Yes, really good...
- Alright.

265
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:51,342
Can I pass?

266
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:54,961
- I'm off. Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

267
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:57,597
We didn't notice your friend.

268
00:29:57,721 --> 00:30:00,275
No, we are not friends, just...

269
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,040
sharing the same compartment.

270
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,969
So, what are you having?
Pancakes with jam?

271
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:11,783
You'll have pancakes.

272
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:14,280
- So, pancakes with jam for everybody?
- Yes!

273
00:30:14,393 --> 00:30:16,250
- Right.
- Strawberry jam!

274
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:17,925
Strawberry jam!

275
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,250
- Right. And a salad.
- Yes.

276
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,841
Goodbye.

277
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,794
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

278
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,880
Irina...

279
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,647
my love...

280
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:05,939
Greetings from...

281
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:14,058
from... from...

282
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:19,253
I don't know where. But...

283
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:23,250
There is a...

284
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:29,706
an old lady,

285
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,246
pickles.

286
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,830
Another old lady.

287
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,422
And...

288
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:52,557
that's...

289
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,130
my neighbour.

290
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,120
He sleeps there.

291
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:24,935
I wish this were...

292
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:26,960
your bed.

293
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:29,689
Your pillow.

294
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,218
Your stuff.

295
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:38,920
Your sock.

296
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:07,985
What are you going to do
in Petrosavodsk?

297
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,345
What?

298
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:14,604
You know this train
stops at Petrozavodsk for the night?

299
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,939
I know.

300
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:23,977
Will you go out to the city?

301
00:34:25,058 --> 00:34:26,253
No.

302
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:30,871
I'll go to bed.

303
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:35,959
Awesome idea!

304
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,198
Think about it.

305
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,461
I'm going to

306
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:45,781
visit a friend there,

307
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:48,928
you can join me if you like.

308
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,018
No, thanks.

309
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:54,138
But why not?

310
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,280
You will like her.

311
00:34:57,405 --> 00:35:01,008
You like old stuff,
and she is really old.

312
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:03,235
Like that thing of yours...

313
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,777
- The petroglyphs.
- Yeah, the petroglyphs.

314
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:12,773
And who is she?

315
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:15,642
Your mom?

316
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:24,202
She's better than mom.

317
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,104
Anyway, I'm not interested.

318
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,076
So?

319
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,916
You sure you want to
spend the night in the train?

320
00:35:58,488 --> 00:36:00,144
Or at the station?

321
00:36:00,303 --> 00:36:01,544
Yes.

322
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:04,707
You're so fucking boring.

323
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,733
She's got vodka.

324
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:11,387
And an old Russian stove!

325
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,187
And a cat!

326
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:18,668
Babushka, a cat and a stove...

327
00:36:18,835 --> 00:36:20,835
Have she got a balalaika?

328
00:36:24,034 --> 00:36:25,834
No, no balalaika.

329
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:29,369
If there's no balalaika... then I'm not going.

330
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:36,500
Good night!

331
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,507
Screw you.

332
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,646
Come out already.

333
00:37:02,747 --> 00:37:03,978
Get out!

334
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:05,252
Mm...

335
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:06,809
What, mm?

336
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,666
You're not talking to anyone, I know.

337
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:16,486
Look, have a heart! Finally!

338
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:18,086
Please.

339
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:19,972
Hey!

340
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,489
What's the problem?

341
00:37:23,152 --> 00:37:26,732
She is keeping the phone
but she's not talking to anyone...

342
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,519
Hello!

343
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,060
It's me. I'm here in... Petroskoi.

344
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:35,839
- Are you coming to pick me up?
- So now she is talking.

345
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:38,044
- Great!
- I need a phone, too.

346
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:40,558
Fuck off, asshole!

347
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,846
Why so rude?

348
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,730
Everything fine?

349
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,430
All fine.

350
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,764
Your last chance. Are you coming?

351
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:12,671
Let's go.
I have everything fixed there.

352
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:18,127
Okay, let's roll!

353
00:38:21,264 --> 00:38:23,511
Where did you get the car?

354
00:38:24,831 --> 00:38:26,430
I have connections.

355
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:14,610
Just to keep me awake.

356
00:39:19,128 --> 00:39:20,670
Where are we going?

357
00:39:21,582 --> 00:39:23,275
To Yuri Gagarin.

358
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,920
That's Yuri.

359
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:45,597
I've brought some stuff.

360
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:49,104
It's in the kitchen.

361
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:06,957
- Good evening.
- You, too, be well!

362
00:42:24,316 --> 00:42:26,536
I'll teach you some statistics.

363
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:30,529
I can count the population of Ireland.

364
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,593
And you'll see there is more people
in Ireland than in China.

365
00:42:33,702 --> 00:42:34,873
But how?

366
00:42:35,036 --> 00:42:36,336
It's simple.

367
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:40,515
If we consider only the red-headed people

368
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,399
as human beings.

369
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,178
- Why?
- Just because I want it this way.

370
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:51,685
I'll count only redheads as people.

371
00:42:51,823 --> 00:42:54,357
There are lots of redheads in Ireland,
but none in China.

372
00:42:54,443 --> 00:42:55,855
She's red-headed, too.

373
00:42:55,962 --> 00:43:00,448
- So she will be counted, too.
- You're counted as a human being!

374
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:03,687
There!

375
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,801
Okay, I'll go
and have a rest.

376
00:43:08,902 --> 00:43:10,841
- Go.
- And you keep talking.

377
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:14,216
Women...

378
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,425
are very clever animals, indeed!

379
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:20,156
There is a small animal
inside each woman.

380
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,019
You have to learn to
live with it and trust it.

381
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:26,214
Do what you inner self tells you.

382
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,959
Do not listen to your mom, dad,
daughter or husband.

383
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:34,290
- Right.
- Women are very clever animals.

384
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:39,313
I was lucky to learn to
trust my inner self when I was 15.

385
00:43:40,108 --> 00:43:42,627
And I've lived
with it happily for 43 years.

386
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:44,674
I do what it tells.

387
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:47,013
To...

388
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:48,888
Love?

389
00:43:49,122 --> 00:43:51,625
To love, if you wish so.

390
00:43:52,334 --> 00:43:55,620
- Oh, my!
- No, let's drink to something more concrete.

391
00:43:55,687 --> 00:43:57,757
- Yes.
- Now I know!

392
00:43:57,954 --> 00:44:00,519
Let's drink to you!

393
00:44:01,988 --> 00:44:05,609
That is right, just look.

394
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,728
Let's drink to you.

395
00:44:07,835 --> 00:44:10,788
Firstly, I hate moonshine.

396
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,019
But as I agree to drinking it
instead of vodka,

397
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:17,759
let's make the most of it.

398
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,626
- Here's to you!
- Alright.

399
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:23,166
I hope you get
everything you wish in life!

400
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:26,249
To your inner animal. Let's drink!

401
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:29,769
Yuck! It tastes really bad.

402
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,825
Shit.

403
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,337
Fuck.

404
00:45:45,456 --> 00:45:46,822
Hi!

405
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,750
We need to go.

406
00:45:55,157 --> 00:45:57,293
You've found a good man for yourself.

407
00:46:01,265 --> 00:46:02,971
- Yes...
- That's it.

408
00:46:04,232 --> 00:46:05,910
- Bye!
- Bye!

409
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:26,507
You think I'm a bad guy?

410
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:30,977
Well... I only know what I've seen.

411
00:46:35,574 --> 00:46:37,120
What have you seen?

412
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,553
Home at last!

413
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,534
What's the news?

414
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,909
News from Finland.

415
00:47:58,381 --> 00:48:01,521
"A Finnish man was arrested

416
00:48:01,697 --> 00:48:05,468
"for cursing in a public place."

417
00:48:07,189 --> 00:48:09,345
"A foreign tourist

418
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,666
"traveling to Murmansk

419
00:48:13,398 --> 00:48:15,529
"has gone missing.

420
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,220
"She was probably

421
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:21,424
"kidnapped and eaten
by the Murmansk mafia."

422
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,572
- Is that really in the paper?
- Yeah!

423
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:26,875
Can I have a look?

424
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:28,408
No.

425
00:48:57,813 --> 00:49:00,612
- I'll get some tea. You want some?
- No.

426
00:49:13,482 --> 00:49:16,205
This is not your car.
You need a different car.

427
00:49:16,642 --> 00:49:19,604
You have a ticket to the 3rd class.

428
00:49:19,844 --> 00:49:21,794
And this is the 2nd class.
Do you understand?

429
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:24,321
- I don't speak Russian.
- I can't...

430
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:27,540
Look, I can't let you in.
You are in a wrong car.

431
00:49:28,244 --> 00:49:30,344
Gosh! You need a different car.

432
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,249
Can I have a tea bag?

433
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:33,830
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

434
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:38,531
Thanks.

435
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:40,758
Go away, or I'll kick you out.

436
00:49:40,838 --> 00:49:42,580
- Oh, for heaven's sake!
- Okay, okay.

437
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:46,580
- Are you, perhaps, from Finland?
- Yeah. Hi.

438
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:50,194
Can you help me?
I don't know if I'm on the right train.

439
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,210
Murmansk?

440
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,734
Yeah. I didn't understand
a fucking thing she said.

441
00:49:53,832 --> 00:49:56,017
I'll be getting off
before Murmansk.

442
00:49:56,066 --> 00:49:58,152
- You don't have a compartment?
- No.

443
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,860
Well, you can come to ours.

444
00:50:01,973 --> 00:50:05,337
- There's this Russian guy and me.
- Oh, cool.

445
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:10,787
So, you play guitar.

446
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:12,500
Yeah, a little.

447
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:21,774
Hi!

448
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:30,508
How are you?

449
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,155
Ljoha.

450
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:35,801
Aloha.

451
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,684
Nice bag.

452
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:46,524
It's a cool bag, leather bag.

453
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:54,138
Okay, then.

454
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:14,586
Have you been traveling a long time?

455
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,805
A couple of months.

456
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:21,387
Alone?

457
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:23,893
Mostly, yeah.

458
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,880
Do you ever feel...

459
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,693
alone?

460
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:35,634
Well, I don't know...

461
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:40,267
Everyone's alone.

462
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:49,051
<i>Please, immediately leave the tracks, sir!</i>

463
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:55,152
How long does the train stay here?

464
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,555
40 minutes,
you can go out if you like.

465
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,872
I'll go outside.

466
00:54:01,979 --> 00:54:03,712
I'll come with you.

467
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:13,429
Is everything okay?

468
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:17,975
It looked like it hurt.

469
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:20,272
What?

470
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:22,557
You fell down on the track.

471
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:24,876
I did not fall on the track.

472
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:27,819
I saw you slipping.

473
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:31,440
I didn't slip.

474
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:39,031
We're going for a walk.
Want to go with us?

475
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:40,500
It sucks.

476
00:54:41,097 --> 00:54:43,410
- What?
- This place is dead.

477
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,634
Okay.

478
00:54:46,936 --> 00:54:48,575
See you.

479
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:50,308
Goodbye.

480
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,426
It looked like he had a situation.

481
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:51,608
Hi!

482
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,382
- You need something?
- I'm not sure.

483
00:55:55,342 --> 00:55:59,292
- Drink with us.
- The dog came here and so did we.

484
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,051
- Hi!
- Fucking fate, eh!

485
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:03,565
Come on.

486
00:56:03,814 --> 00:56:06,834
Should we get going?
My toes are pretty frozen.

487
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:08,365
Here, take it.

488
00:56:08,493 --> 00:56:10,112
How much?

489
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,872
Take what you can get.

490
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:14,730
- What?
- Go ahead, take it.

491
00:56:15,169 --> 00:56:16,769
Russian alcohol.

492
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:18,804
- Thanks!
- It's a gift.

493
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,084
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

494
00:56:22,517 --> 00:56:24,717
- Thank you! Bye!
- Welcome!

495
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:27,596
- Thanks, cheers!
- Cheers!

496
00:56:38,944 --> 00:56:42,276
I've brought you something.

497
00:56:46,777 --> 00:56:48,408
Fuck off!

498
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:01,674
What did he say?

499
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:04,408
He said...

500
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:06,961
he's not thirsty.

501
00:57:13,895 --> 00:57:17,468
There must be a factory around here
where they make guys like him.

502
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:20,015
Right?

503
00:58:42,454 --> 00:58:43,774
Thanks.

504
00:58:45,586 --> 00:58:46,851
Bye.

505
00:58:52,472 --> 00:58:54,759
Get back in the train!

506
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,412
We're leaving soon.

507
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:01,763
- Can I smoke inside?
- No!

508
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,631
Please...

509
00:59:07,538 --> 00:59:09,058
Come in.

510
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:13,192
Thank you.

511
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,972
What's wrong?

512
01:00:17,323 --> 01:00:18,806
My camera!

513
01:00:19,671 --> 01:00:21,372
What happened?

514
01:00:30,018 --> 01:00:31,245
Fuck!

515
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,915
What's with the camera?

516
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:39,397
He has taken my camera!

517
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,989
This asshole!

518
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:47,614
You mean, stole it?

519
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:49,029
Yes!

520
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:54,109
I had my whole Moscow on that tape.

521
01:01:03,314 --> 01:01:05,927
All humans should be killed.

522
01:01:39,104 --> 01:01:40,897
So, what was it like?

523
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,644
What?

524
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:46,584
Moscow on the tape.

525
01:01:48,717 --> 01:01:50,111
People.

526
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:54,208
Parties.

527
01:01:55,409 --> 01:01:56,986
Flats.

528
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,298
Laughter.

529
01:02:00,062 --> 01:02:01,462
Music...

530
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:05,566
I loved it all...

531
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:08,711
And now I've lost it.

532
01:02:14,844 --> 01:02:16,804
So, what about the boyfriend?

533
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,880
My boyfriend's name is Irina.

534
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:32,110
She's the most beautiful person
I've ever met.

535
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,686
We...

536
01:02:38,262 --> 01:02:41,796
were supposed to do this trip together.

537
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:44,370
But she had to work.

538
01:02:45,282 --> 01:02:48,836
And... I went anyway.

539
01:02:54,216 --> 01:02:56,342
I don't know why.

540
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:03,027
She has a beautiful life...

541
01:03:04,064 --> 01:03:06,298
and a beautiful flat...

542
01:03:07,505 --> 01:03:09,284
like in books.

543
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:19,033
I wanted so badly
to be a part of that life, too.

544
01:03:19,847 --> 01:03:22,171
To be a part of that flat.

545
01:03:27,382 --> 01:03:29,349
Tell me about that flat.

546
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,455
It's got...

547
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,792
old, beautiful...

548
01:03:38,763 --> 01:03:40,736
hardwood floors.

549
01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:45,101
High ceilings.

550
01:03:48,137 --> 01:03:50,408
And drawings...

551
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,245
on the walls...

552
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:55,559
Patterns...

553
01:03:56,306 --> 01:03:58,937
Like, paper on the wall.

554
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:03,060
- Wallpaper, eh?
- Wallpaper.

555
01:04:03,154 --> 01:04:04,920
Wallpaper, right.

556
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:07,000
And...

557
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:10,592
old furniture

558
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:14,362
that's been in the family for many years.

559
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:21,072
On weekends, we used to take long walks.

560
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:26,117
Sometimes we visited museums.

561
01:04:30,384 --> 01:04:33,678
In the evenings, people would come over.

562
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,706
We drank, laughed...

563
01:04:42,053 --> 01:04:43,757
and talked.

564
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:50,467
Cool.

565
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:56,688
I thought I would miss her more, but...

566
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:59,255
honestly...

567
01:05:03,277 --> 01:05:06,610
I just miss the way she used to look at me.

568
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:18,491
I'm a terrible person, I should be killed.

569
01:05:27,175 --> 01:05:28,701
Alright, then!

570
01:05:30,534 --> 01:05:32,074
Murmansk is close.

571
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:35,738
Let's celebrate!

572
01:05:37,194 --> 01:05:38,921
How? Where?

573
01:05:40,016 --> 01:05:43,786
How, where...
In the restaurant car, of course.

574
01:05:48,510 --> 01:05:49,210
Let's go.

575
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:09,879
Right.

576
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,199
- Well!
- How can I help you?

577
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:17,996
We don't need help, we need food! So...

578
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,812
go ahead.

579
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:23,994
- Champagne and...
- Right.

580
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:27,309
And... chicken with potatoes.

581
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,120
- Great!
- Ran out of it.

582
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:33,591
Okay, then we'll have salmon.

583
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:36,045
No salmon, either.
It's the end of the route.

584
01:06:36,138 --> 01:06:38,994
Well, what do you have?
Caviar?

585
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,140
Let me check.
Just a minute.

586
01:06:47,686 --> 01:06:52,219
I'm sorry you had to
stand me during the whole trip.

587
01:06:53,146 --> 01:06:55,366
I've had worse, you know.

588
01:06:57,121 --> 01:07:00,999
We can make some sandwiches
with cheese and sausage.

589
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,580
No warm food, sorry.

590
01:07:02,722 --> 01:07:04,455
We'll have sandwiches, then.

591
01:07:04,569 --> 01:07:06,933
Bring it all here. Go ahead!

592
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,120
So... Let's...

593
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:17,539
Let's drink!

594
01:07:33,111 --> 01:07:36,077
Dammit. I can't drink this shit.
I'll be right back.

595
01:07:37,464 --> 01:07:40,004
Just a second, one second.

596
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:45,389
Right...

597
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:48,616
This will do?

598
01:07:51,037 --> 01:07:54,091
You know... Look...

599
01:07:58,023 --> 01:07:59,183
Okay.

600
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,263
Right, thank you. Give it to me.

601
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:07,104
Here is is! Just look at it!

602
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:10,943
Now everything's in order. As it should be.

603
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:13,280
That's better.

604
01:08:16,456 --> 01:08:18,572
Right. Okay.

605
01:08:20,456 --> 01:08:22,022
Let's drink to...

606
01:08:23,656 --> 01:08:26,258
That thingy... what's it called?

607
01:08:26,656 --> 01:08:28,540
- Drawings.
- Petroglyphs.

608
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:30,886
Right! To the petroglyphs!

609
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,363
Yes, to the petroglyphs!

610
01:08:41,495 --> 01:08:42,968
What's wrong?

611
01:08:43,354 --> 01:08:46,415
- Everything's fine.
- Don't like it, do you?

612
01:08:46,762 --> 01:08:50,000
Fine? Then let's have another round.

613
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:54,182
Let's drink to...

614
01:09:04,455 --> 01:09:05,861
What's that?

615
01:09:12,735 --> 01:09:14,231
Here, take it.

616
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:15,718
What is it?

617
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,653
- Is this me?
- Yes.

618
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:44,166
Looks like me, really.

619
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:51,460
You can draw me, too.

620
01:09:52,913 --> 01:09:56,353
No, no! No way!
I don't know how to do it.

621
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,259
Don't expect too much...

622
01:10:57,953 --> 01:10:59,699
- Shit...
- Can I see?

623
01:10:59,906 --> 01:11:01,159
Well...

624
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:07,079
- Fuck it.
- Can I see, please?

625
01:11:07,152 --> 01:11:09,080
There's nothing to see.
It's not good.

626
01:11:12,686 --> 01:11:13,620
Okay...

627
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:17,066
Write me your address.

628
01:11:17,646 --> 01:11:20,420
- So we'll be best friends?
- Well, just in case.

629
01:11:21,085 --> 01:11:23,616
- No need to do that.
- What, exactly?

630
01:11:24,607 --> 01:11:26,388
No need to do any of this.

631
01:11:27,431 --> 01:11:28,830
Why not?

632
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:33,033
You never know what might come around.

633
01:11:35,685 --> 01:11:37,083
No...

634
01:11:37,378 --> 01:11:40,290
No, I don't want it.
It's a stupid idea.

635
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:43,518
- But...
- Enough of this crap.

636
01:11:52,652 --> 01:11:54,485
Your sandwiches.

637
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:01,457
Shit.

638
01:14:57,181 --> 01:14:58,661
Thanks.

639
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,901
Is everything okay?

640
01:15:03,927 --> 01:15:07,252
Yes. Everything is just perfect.

641
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:19,133
Thank you.

642
01:16:33,932 --> 01:16:36,326
- We have arrived.
- Yes.

643
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,385
Here.

644
01:17:33,044 --> 01:17:36,178
I'm afraid nothing is booked on your name.

645
01:17:37,531 --> 01:17:41,466
I think the booking was made
by Irina Mezhinskaya.

646
01:17:43,312 --> 01:17:45,426
Yes. And where's
Ms. Mezhinskaya?

647
01:17:45,604 --> 01:17:47,393
She's not coming.

648
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,356
Why?

649
01:17:55,944 --> 01:17:57,333
Just because.

650
01:17:59,943 --> 01:18:01,245
Alright.

651
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:52,070
Bye. Have a good stay.

652
01:18:57,244 --> 01:18:59,343
- They burn the sofa...
- Assholes!

653
01:18:59,549 --> 01:19:01,248
Hello again.

654
01:19:01,683 --> 01:19:03,375
- Do you have a question?
- Yes.

655
01:19:03,457 --> 01:19:06,680
I came here to see the petroglyphs.

656
01:19:06,783 --> 01:19:09,466
- You know about them?
- Yes, I know.

657
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:14,137
But... I'm not exactly sure
where they are and how to get there.

658
01:19:14,256 --> 01:19:17,822
Can you help me to find
a tour guide or something?

659
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:20,475
- Just a second.
- Where? There's no way.

660
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:24,431
- Car?
- Are you kidding? It'll get stuck there.

661
01:19:26,309 --> 01:19:29,002
I'm afraid it is not possible at the moment.

662
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:30,524
But why not?

663
01:19:30,673 --> 01:19:32,770
Come back in summer.

664
01:19:33,678 --> 01:19:37,741
No, excuse me,
but I know for sure that it's possible.

665
01:19:37,836 --> 01:19:39,558
- My friend--
- How?

666
01:19:39,832 --> 01:19:41,238
With a road like that?

667
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:43,091
There is no road to that place.

668
01:19:47,153 --> 01:19:49,640
Offer her a different tour.

669
01:19:51,335 --> 01:19:54,920
But we have other things to offer.

670
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:59,567
"Murmansk the hero-city" tour,
very interesting and exciting.

671
01:19:59,648 --> 01:20:01,387
- Have a look.
- Mm.

672
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,081
Thank you.

673
01:20:12,193 --> 01:20:15,710
...of 1941-1945
with little or no loss...

674
01:20:15,752 --> 01:20:19,875
And provided coverage of the city
and direction of the civil population...

675
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:22,915
The Germans were ready to...

676
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,196
<i>Hello.</i>

677
01:20:41,276 --> 01:20:42,870
<i>I'm looking for a tour guide.</i>

678
01:20:43,216 --> 01:20:45,540
<i>- A tour guide?
- Yes. I want to see...</i>

679
01:20:46,756 --> 01:20:48,122
this.

680
01:20:50,724 --> 01:20:54,097
- A tour guide... Yeah, yeah.
- You know it?

681
01:20:58,413 --> 01:21:01,115
You know, you can't get there.

682
01:21:01,753 --> 01:21:02,949
Why?

683
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:08,287
You just can't go there.
And where are you from?

684
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:10,431
Finland.

685
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,744
Oh, I see. That's why
you don't know

686
01:21:12,858 --> 01:21:15,524
you can't get there by car in winter.

687
01:21:15,798 --> 01:21:17,161
Well...

688
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:21,581
is there any other way?

689
01:21:21,983 --> 01:21:24,069
No idea. I guess...

690
01:21:24,298 --> 01:21:27,141
scientists get there by helicopter.

691
01:21:27,303 --> 01:21:29,788
Archeologists.
If you're an archeologist.

692
01:22:28,461 --> 01:22:29,626
<i>Hello?</i>

693
01:22:31,021 --> 01:22:32,253
<i>Hello?</i>

694
01:22:32,688 --> 01:22:34,854
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

695
01:22:35,753 --> 01:22:37,627
<i>Oh, hi! How are you?</i>

696
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,989
<i>How's Murmansk?</i>

697
01:22:40,124 --> 01:22:41,657
<i>Have you seen the petroglyphs?</i>

698
01:22:41,766 --> 01:22:42,970
No.

699
01:22:43,352 --> 01:22:46,151
Everyone says it's impossible...

700
01:22:47,152 --> 01:22:48,701
to get there in winter.

701
01:22:48,852 --> 01:22:50,294
It is too far.

702
01:22:50,385 --> 01:22:52,076
There is no road.

703
01:22:52,786 --> 01:22:57,728
<i>- Mm.</i>
- Everything seems to be too far away.

704
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,688
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

705
01:23:13,115 --> 01:23:15,620
<i>But there are
other things to see here,</i>

706
01:23:16,267 --> 01:23:18,558
interesting also.

707
01:23:21,048 --> 01:23:22,971
<i>I'm sure there is.</i>

708
01:23:28,281 --> 01:23:31,460
<i>Look, I have to go.
Anything else you wanted to tell me?</i>

709
01:23:31,913 --> 01:23:34,481
<i>What time is it there?</i>

710
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:37,755
<i>What do you mean?</i>

711
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:41,170
<i>Moscow time,
it's the same as in Murmansk.</i>

712
01:23:41,312 --> 01:23:43,263
<i>Ah, yes, of course it is.</i>

713
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:46,861
<i>- Look, I have to go. Okay?</i>
- Okay.

714
01:23:47,004 --> 01:23:49,109
<i>Okay. Bye!</i>

715
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:51,609
- Bye!
<i>- Bye-bye!</i>

716
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,183
- Can I take these?
- Yes.

717
01:26:46,053 --> 01:26:48,952
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. It's the receptionist.</i>

718
01:26:49,093 --> 01:26:50,799
<i>There's someone
waiting for you.</i>

719
01:26:50,895 --> 01:26:52,153
- Mm.
<i>- Bye.</i>

720
01:26:52,238 --> 01:26:54,653
Thank you. Yes.

721
01:27:22,666 --> 01:27:23,979
Hi!

722
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:29,233
Okay, let's go!

723
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,274
Where?

724
01:27:33,813 --> 01:27:36,353
To... look at that crap...

725
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,500
But they told me it is impossible.

726
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:44,250
Oh! They are lazy bastards,
you know.

727
01:27:46,038 --> 01:27:47,080
Alright.

728
01:27:48,207 --> 01:27:50,268
I need my coat.

729
01:27:50,963 --> 01:27:52,210
- Right.
- Come on.

730
01:27:58,009 --> 01:27:59,543
Get in.

731
01:28:01,201 --> 01:28:02,801
He'll take us there.

732
01:28:05,695 --> 01:28:07,272
Nice to meet you.

733
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:01,468
- Hi, guys.
- Hey!

734
01:30:02,212 --> 01:30:05,063
So, listen up.

735
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:08,915
We're heading to... What's it called?

736
01:30:09,015 --> 01:30:10,957
- The petroglyphs.
- The petroglyphs.

737
01:30:11,058 --> 01:30:12,557
- Heard of it?
- Yeah.

738
01:30:12,725 --> 01:30:15,567
As far as I get it,
the only way there now is...

739
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:17,888
By water, but there's a gale warning.

740
01:30:18,005 --> 01:30:23,003
I see but it won't take us long,
just there and back, you know.

741
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:24,855
She has come from...

742
01:30:24,988 --> 01:30:26,388
- Finland.
- From Finland.

743
01:30:26,489 --> 01:30:29,631
Across the whole country,
just to have a look at them,

744
01:30:29,718 --> 01:30:31,209
- the petroglyphs.
- Really?

745
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:33,606
- Yeah, really.
- Yes!

746
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:37,598
- You want to go by sea?
- Yes, by sea!

747
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:40,638
- No one will go by sea now.
- Why?

748
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,640
It's not safe, goddammit!

749
01:30:44,733 --> 01:30:48,153
Just yesterday,
a boat was washed fucking ashore.

750
01:30:48,246 --> 01:30:50,237
And the wind had come
just the day before.

751
01:30:50,353 --> 01:30:52,132
You want
another one today?

752
01:30:52,192 --> 01:30:56,184
I don't ask you to go
to the Arctic Ocean, for fuck's sake!

753
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:59,241
Just go out and move
along the shore. Is it hard?!

754
01:30:59,374 --> 01:31:02,983
Money is not a problem.
I'll pay you! Cut the shit, guys.

755
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:05,895
- Where?
- The fucking petroglyphs!

756
01:31:06,151 --> 01:31:09,218
The fuck I know where!
Tell me where.

757
01:31:09,322 --> 01:31:10,759
For fuck's sake!

758
01:31:10,872 --> 01:31:12,966
- I know where.
- He knows!

759
01:31:13,144 --> 01:31:14,080
I do.

760
01:31:14,149 --> 01:31:18,000
- Then we'll go with you.
- Well, I don't know...

761
01:31:37,673 --> 01:31:40,505
- Look. Stop whining...
- Ljoha!

762
01:31:49,012 --> 01:31:50,911
Ljoha! Ljoha!

763
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:55,224
- We don't need to do this.
- Okay, let's go!

764
01:31:55,728 --> 01:31:57,344
It's all fixed!

765
01:37:06,361 --> 01:37:07,634
That's it?

766
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:15,038
That's it.

767
01:38:34,095 --> 01:38:35,975
Have you seen the <i>Titanic</i>?

768
01:38:36,302 --> 01:38:37,549
Yes!

769
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:42,019
We are like them now.

770
01:38:42,608 --> 01:38:44,932
We're gonna die soon, too?

771
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,307
Well, Rose didn't die.

772
01:38:51,273 --> 01:38:53,913
She did in the end.

773
01:38:54,759 --> 01:38:57,493
Later at some point.

774
01:41:25,972 --> 01:41:28,059
Back to the hotel?

775
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,732
Yes.

776
01:41:40,277 --> 01:41:41,797
Music?

777
01:41:59,948 --> 01:42:02,460
This is from Ljoha.

778
01:42:15,792 --> 01:42:20,170
HAISTA VITTU

778
01:42:21,305 --> 01:43:21,306
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
