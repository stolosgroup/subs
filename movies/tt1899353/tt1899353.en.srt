2
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,413
What time is it sweetheart?
-- It's early, go back to sleep.

3
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:53,597
I told you to wake me.

4
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,700
You need your rest... you both do.

5
00:01:58,581 --> 00:02:00,579
I love you.

6
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:05,476
I love you too.

7
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:09,197
Daddy will be home soon.

8
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:42,448
I'll bring him home.

9
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:59,746
THE RAID: REDEMPTION

10
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:21,988
OK, listen up.
Our target is Tama Riyadi.

11
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,409
You all know the brief by now...

12
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,108
The man's an underworld legend.

13
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,513
Considered a king... a God...
by every criminal in town.

14
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,446
This building's his own personal fortress
hidden from the police.

15
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:42,840
I don't care how powerful he's become..
He must be stopped.

16
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,647
Be aware, he leases most of the rooms...

17
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:49,587
to scumbags running from the law.

18
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,552
Our mission is this...

19
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,798
We enter, and we take him down!

20
00:03:57,084 --> 00:04:00,971
Yes sir!
-- But that's not all...

21
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,105
Intel's advising of an in-house narcotics lab.

22
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:08,990
So there'll be extra security.

23
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,585
but we must destroy it.

24
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:17,676
He also has two personal bodyguards.

25
00:04:18,276 --> 00:04:20,274
The first, "mad dog".

26
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:25,470
A homicidal maniac,
with a real violent streak.

27
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,868
Then there's Andy,
more brains than brawn.

28
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,192
He keeps "mad dog" in check.
But don't be fooled...

29
00:04:33,544 --> 00:04:36,048
He'll kill you just as easily,
given the chance.

30
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:40,538
Watch this for me.
I'll be right back.

31
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:02,130
Where were we?

32
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,478
Focus at all times.

33
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,834
We'll take the place floor by floor.

34
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:17,042
Watch for spotters.

35
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,508
Sarge, why today?
It feels rushed.

36
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,853
Are you serious?
-- It's a valid question!

37
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:29,038
Go back to the academy if you're scared.

38
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:31,214
You two finished?

39
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,043
Can I continue?

40
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,690
Remember, this wont be the first time
Tama's come under attack.

41
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,807
His rivals have all tried in the past.

42
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,707
Tried... and failed.

43
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:52,944
Be careful in there men.
This will NOT be a walk in the park.

44
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,946
30 seconds.

45
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,408
Prepare your weapons.

46
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:15,189
There'll be no empty seats in here
on the way home.

47
00:07:15,204 --> 00:07:18,390
Now, let's clean up this fucking city.

48
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,854
Lieutenant.
-- Sergeant Jaka.

49
00:07:55,055 --> 00:07:56,852
Who's the kid?

50
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:57,851
A rookie...

51
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:01,848
he was a standout in the academy.

52
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,595
Do you understand how critical this is?

53
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:10,739
Of course,
but we need the manpower.

54
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:14,835
Inexperience could ruin this mission...

55
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,832
This wont be like field training!

56
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,829
Ok, he'll bring up the rear.

57
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:25,325
Yeah, the very VERY rear!

58
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,488
We'll divide into teams...
I'll enter through B-3.

59
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,787
You take the right flank.

60
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:14,780
And the lieutenant?
He'll come with me.

61
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,705
Take him out.

62
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:52,686
B-3 secured.

63
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:58,681
C'mon, let's move!

64
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,759
Where you off to?

65
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,358
What the hell?

66
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:26,657
Let me go!

67
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:29,655
You're not going anywhere!

68
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:33,152
My wife's sick
she needs these meds.

69
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:35,651
Now let me go...

70
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:39,148
Try to move again & you're dead!

71
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,248
What the...?

72
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:42,847
Relax.

73
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,146
Bowo, enough!

74
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,424
A hero huh?

75
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:53,639
Fine, he's all yours.

76
00:11:57,337 --> 00:12:01,632
What's your apartment number?
-- 726.

77
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,030
She'll get her meds, don't worry

78
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,905
But for your protection,
we'll have to escort you.

79
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:10,804
My wife needs these now!

80
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,102
I understand, but please be patient.

81
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:17,100
Fuck that...
-- Hey!

82
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:20,098
It's either my way...

83
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,197
or his.

84
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:23,597
Huddle up!

85
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:25,596
It's time to enter.

86
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:29,593
We're watching you!

87
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,564
Stop!

88
00:13:11,554 --> 00:13:14,551
Clear!

89
00:13:30,536 --> 00:13:32,834
Cuff him!

90
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,731
Son of a bitch!

91
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,971
Remain calm!

92
00:14:33,977 --> 00:14:35,975
Don't do anything stupid.

93
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,337
Listen to me kid.

94
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:46,545
We wont shoot.

95
00:14:55,801 --> 00:14:57,799
Now listen...

96
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:59,425
Stop!

97
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,225
Police!

98
00:15:31,126 --> 00:15:33,823
What was that?
-- I had to.

99
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:38,238
Sarge,
We have a spotter!

100
00:15:38,774 --> 00:15:40,772
Fuck!

101
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,885
Police!

102
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,270
We've got company.

103
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:06,035
I've been waiting for this.

104
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:14,220
Cease all communication.
We're going into lockdown.

105
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:19,433
I'll call the neighbors.

106
00:17:26,473 --> 00:17:29,570
We have visitors.
You know what to do.

107
00:17:57,354 --> 00:18:00,251
I'll take the one on the left,
You take the right.

108
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,684
Now...

109
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,372
Wait,
Let him scream.

110
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,486
Exterior clear.

111
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:19,052
Last night was the worst
game I've ever seen.

112
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:22,103
They couldn't score in a whorehouse.

113
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,251
Sometimes I wonder why I follow the...

114
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:57,575
Help!
They're trying to kill me!

115
00:19:57,838 --> 00:20:00,835
Don't move!
-- Help me, please!

116
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:03,027
Stop!

117
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:12,694
Fifth floor's clear.

118
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:32,618
Hold your position!
Find out what the fuck's happening down there.

119
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,913
Lieutenant, stay with me.

120
00:20:40,946 --> 00:20:43,843
Forget him!
Return to your position.

121
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:50,405
Vehicle 1... Vehicle 1.
This is Jaka, come in.

122
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,983
All units. This is Jaka.
Come in.

123
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:03,086
They're all dead.

124
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:09,087
Good morning everyone!

125
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:14,630
In case you haven't noticed by now..

126
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:20,966
We have some rather unwelcome guests today.

127
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,124
Now, as a public notice to all...

128
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:30,773
should you help rid the building
of this little 'infestation'...

129
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,725
you can consider yourself a lifelong resident...
Free of charge.

130
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:42,486
These fucking cockroaches
are currently located on the sixth floor.

131
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,132
So good luck.

132
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:49,753
And please, enjoy yourselves.

133
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,797
Lieutenant, call it in.
We need backup.

134
00:21:56,734 --> 00:22:00,200
We can handle it!
-- With all due respect..

135
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:03,922
It'll be a blood bath at this rate.
Make the call!

136
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,493
I can't...
-- What, why not?

137
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:08,692
because...
we aren't...

138
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,067
Who else knows we're here?

139
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,982
What the fuck have you gotten us into?

140
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,665
We're alone.

141
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,446
Sarge!

142
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:47,800
You stay put.

143
00:23:51,387 --> 00:23:53,875
Wait!

144
00:24:16,442 --> 00:24:18,440
Everyone fall back!

145
00:24:18,468 --> 00:24:20,962
Move!

146
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:48,795
What have you done now?
-- Come here.

147
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,678
See for yourself.

148
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,498
Are you crazy?
-- Hey, watch it.

149
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,371
Everything's under control.

150
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,541
Well then answer me this...

151
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:18,827
What happens when reinforcements arrive?

152
00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:21,589
You don't kill cops, you buy them!

153
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:24,480
Does it look like they want a cheque?

154
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,485
There won't be any reinforcements.
Or repercussions.

155
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:33,462
This is no different from one of our
rivals getting torn to pieces.

156
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:38,940
and afterwards,
we'll simply clean up the mess.

157
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,229
How's that?
-- Because I know who's behind this.

158
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,124
Scared old fuck.

159
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:52,819
I've got you right where I want you.

160
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:55,221
Pull back. Hangi, open the door.
-- Yes, sir!

161
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,052
Clear?
-- Clear!

162
00:27:09,053 --> 00:27:11,051
Shut the door.

163
00:27:26,953 --> 00:27:28,951
No, wait!

164
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:38,268
Fuck!

165
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,053
We have to get out of here.

166
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:02,390
Alee, your axe!

167
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:17,852
Sarge!

168
00:28:37,536 --> 00:28:39,534
Follow me.

169
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,346
Jaka!

170
00:28:49,347 --> 00:28:51,345
Wait!

171
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:22,743
They're coming!

172
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,572
Bowo, axe!

173
00:29:53,062 --> 00:29:55,060
Get me the fuck out of here!

174
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:38,492
Alee, help!

175
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,710
Dagu!

176
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:03,464
Once I dump this, turn it 'round.
One, two, three.

177
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,587
The fuck was that?

178
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,665
They just hit back.

179
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:19,001
What's the damage?

180
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:22,582
I'd estimate about 2 rooms.

181
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:26,336
That's not bad.

182
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:30,333
And about 30 rent-paying residents...

183
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:32,454
Check which rooms they stayed in.

184
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:35,786
Clean out their valuables..

185
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:37,861
to cover the damage.

186
00:31:40,593 --> 00:31:46,188
Both of you get down there.
I want this brought under control.

187
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:51,321
Yes, boss.

188
00:35:10,065 --> 00:35:12,063
I'll use the stairs,
you take the lift.

189
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:15,937
Meet back on the 7th floor.
Tommy, Ang - go with him.

190
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:18,419
I'm fine alone.

191
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:20,442
Go with him.

192
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,319
Go on.

193
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:28,762
Fine.

194
00:37:36,249 --> 00:37:38,846
Where we going?
-- Room 726.

195
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:41,556
Why?
-- The guy from downstairs.

196
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:44,827
No, not him!
-- He's our only hope.

197
00:37:44,872 --> 00:37:47,969
We can't trust him.
What if he's one of them?

198
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:50,247
He's not.

199
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:02,694
Leave it.

200
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:46,279
Up 2 floors.

201
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:30,419
Hey..
Hey, open up!

202
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:40,050
Open the door please!
If you don't let us in, we're dead.

203
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:43,733
Don't do it,
don't get us involved.

204
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,318
Please, they're coming.

205
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:03,632
I'm begging you, look at me.

206
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:07,192
Open the door.
Please!

207
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:11,669
Don't turn your back on us, please.

208
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:31,190
Start searching from there.

209
00:42:32,942 --> 00:42:35,040
Over here.

210
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:43,129
Wait.

211
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:28,717
What the fuck's going on?

212
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:33,134
Shut the fuck up or I'll cut you.

213
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:38,153
Check high and low.

214
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:41,205
Don't leave anything unturned.

215
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:45,231
You hiding anyone here?
-- No way.

216
00:43:46,002 --> 00:43:48,000
You wouldn't be lying now, would you?

217
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,416
I fucking hate liars.

218
00:43:51,948 --> 00:43:53,946
They put me in a bad mood.

219
00:43:57,081 --> 00:44:00,278
Which tends to make me lash out.

220
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:04,883
Honestly, there's nobody here.
-- We'll see.

221
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:14,371
What's this?

222
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:10,691
Leave that alone.
Hey, careful God damn it!

223
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,705
That's my wife's medication!

224
00:45:13,388 --> 00:45:15,386
Leave us alone would you?

225
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:21,579
This is bullshit.
Look around, there's nobody here!

226
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:23,829
Don't fucking question me.

227
00:45:25,428 --> 00:45:27,726
It's the truth.
please leave us alone!

228
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:04,471
You want me to slice that bitch up?

229
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:06,968
Do you?
Then sit down!

230
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,034
Alright, let's go.

231
00:46:45,425 --> 00:46:49,421
Quick I need a knife,
something sharp.

232
00:47:02,972 --> 00:47:05,570
You're gonna be ok.
Just stay calm.

233
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,019
I'm gonna fix you up.
Hold on...

234
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:11,035
It's all I've got.

235
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,419
Fuck you, look harder.

236
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:22,561
I don't have any knives.
What about a spoon or chopsticks?

237
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:31,867
Screw it, just go.

238
00:48:12,819 --> 00:48:14,817
What's with that?

239
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,873
What the fuck, man?

240
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:00,529
Tell me about this building.

241
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:04,733
There must be an easy way out?

242
00:49:04,824 --> 00:49:06,918
I wish there was.

243
00:49:06,919 --> 00:49:10,215
The truth is,
Tama has complete control of this building.

244
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:12,085
Even if you got past the cameras...

245
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:14,072
They'd trap you in the hallways.

246
00:49:14,192 --> 00:49:16,190
There's no easy escape.

247
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:20,216
The only real route out of here...

248
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:23,593
is the same one you used coming in.

249
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:30,657
Why are you really here anyway?

250
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:34,576
I've seen that old lieutenant here before.

251
00:49:35,101 --> 00:49:38,098
He knows all about this place.

252
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:41,958
Not every cop is dirty you know?

253
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:45,856
I know.
That's why I opened the door.

254
00:49:59,325 --> 00:50:01,723
Bowo can be a pain in the ass.

255
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:04,459
But he's a good man.

256
00:50:05,308 --> 00:50:08,106
Take care of him..
I'll be back as soon as I can.

257
00:50:45,972 --> 00:50:47,970
Haha, that's what I said!

258
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,256
Over here!

259
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:26,401
Up!

260
00:52:45,135 --> 00:52:47,133
Chop his leg!

261
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:53,803
Where did he come from?

262
00:57:00,939 --> 00:57:03,237
Stop it! Calm down!

263
00:57:08,434 --> 00:57:11,824
What the fuck are you doing here?

264
00:57:22,946 --> 00:57:27,011
Stay on the lookout.

265
00:57:46,144 --> 00:57:48,142
They're dead.

266
00:57:49,756 --> 00:57:51,754
We don't know that.

267
00:57:53,475 --> 00:57:57,961
Think about it Jaka,
one's injured & the other's a rookie.

268
00:57:58,836 --> 00:58:00,834
They're no chance.

269
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:06,445
I'm sorry, but going up there is just too risky.

270
00:58:09,457 --> 00:58:11,498
You listen to me.

271
00:58:11,552 --> 00:58:15,045
The lives of my men, rest with me.

272
00:58:15,961 --> 00:58:17,959
You wanna talk about risking lives?

273
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:21,164
you've put ALL of ours at risk!

274
00:58:21,613 --> 00:58:23,611
You owe us all.

275
00:58:24,073 --> 00:58:26,570
Who ordered this mission?
-- What?

276
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,131
It obviously wasn't you.

277
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:32,528
No one leads the charge in their own dirty work.

278
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:36,390
Careful, Jaka.

279
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:39,696
Remember yor rank.
-- Rank?

280
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:43,288
Fuck rank!
Once we make it outta here...

281
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:48,412
You'll be mopping up puddles of piss
in a prison cell for the rest of your life.

282
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,508
We didn't come here for justice, did we?

283
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:55,918
We're here to make someone rich.

284
00:58:56,258 --> 00:59:00,248
I'll ask you one last time,
who ordered this raid?

285
00:59:02,898 --> 00:59:07,687
I'd rather take my chances in here.

286
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:14,175
Suit yourself.

287
00:59:16,142 --> 00:59:20,629
We're going back up there
and we're gonna find them.

288
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:23,410
And then we leave.

289
00:59:25,577 --> 00:59:27,884
Any objections?

290
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:32,119
Thought not.

291
00:59:33,148 --> 00:59:35,146
Everyone ready?

292
00:59:37,612 --> 00:59:40,004
Move out!

293
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,972
Go with him!
Now!

294
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,191
I don't like using these.

295
01:01:42,134 --> 01:01:46,123
Takes away the rush.

296
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:51,676
Squeezing a trigger,
is like ordering takeout.

297
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:54,721
Now this...

298
01:01:56,376 --> 01:01:58,767
This is what it's all about.

299
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:03,207
Gets my blood pumping.

300
01:02:04,082 --> 01:02:06,080
This is what I do.

301
01:05:05,972 --> 01:05:07,970
You shouldn't be here.

302
01:05:10,651 --> 01:05:14,142
Yeah well...
Neither should you.

303
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:20,601
Who are they?

304
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:29,956
Nobody.

305
01:05:33,606 --> 01:05:36,203
Don't they check for family links...

306
01:05:36,204 --> 01:05:40,326
They only have your first name on record.

307
01:05:40,676 --> 01:05:43,373
They couldn't have known.

308
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:48,842
I almost choked
when they showed us your photo.

309
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:52,717
Gone for six years,
and this is how I find you...

310
01:05:58,011 --> 01:06:00,009
You have to leave.

311
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:05,213
Right now.
-- No way.

312
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:08,031
Not without you.
-- What?

313
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,309
You heard.

314
01:06:09,777 --> 01:06:11,969
I don't think you understand...

315
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:15,567
I do.
But it's time you came home.

316
01:06:16,893 --> 01:06:21,984
Look, THIS is my home now.
You want a heart-to-heart, just call.

317
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:23,698
We've had so many briefings.

318
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:28,471
Plotting your death.
I'm your only way out of here...

319
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,363
without being dead or in handcuffs.

320
01:06:30,514 --> 01:06:34,564
Look, I'm not going anywhere ok?

321
01:06:34,643 --> 01:06:36,539
It's you who needs saving.

322
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,391
How many of your team are left?

323
01:06:38,451 --> 01:06:42,590
You're better than this.
-- Really? How so?

324
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:46,768
I was always such a disappointment...

325
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,276
Imagine how proud he'd be of me now!

326
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,854
Dad just wants you home.
We all do.

327
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:07,739
No, fuck it.

328
01:07:08,953 --> 01:07:12,323
I'm not that guy anymore.

329
01:07:13,025 --> 01:07:15,823
This might be wrong in your eyes...

330
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:17,852
but it's all I know how to do.

331
01:07:17,918 --> 01:07:19,917
It's all I'm good at.

332
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,938
This is me now.

333
01:07:22,898 --> 01:07:24,896
No...

334
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:28,702
I won't go back.

335
01:07:40,576 --> 01:07:43,967
You're going to be an uncle.

336
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,569
What?

337
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:52,253
Yeah, a boy.
In two months.

338
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:05,116
You're only telling me this,
to try & change my mind.

339
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:08,642
I'm telling you because you're my brother.
-- Well consider this...

340
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:12,202
If you stay here, you'll be dead,
before he's even born.

341
01:08:12,286 --> 01:08:15,680
Have you thought about that?
-- Every day...

342
01:08:15,732 --> 01:08:18,926
Since I got this job.
And it terrifies me.

343
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,725
Well, I'm sorry...
I'm staying!

344
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,223
Go then, they'll be looking for you.

345
01:08:34,835 --> 01:08:37,732
You should change into civilian clothes.

346
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:42,356
No...
This suits me.

347
01:08:50,155 --> 01:08:55,247
Hang back for a bit,
'til the coast is clear.

348
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:18,768
Hey, hold the lift.

349
01:09:29,697 --> 01:09:33,577
Where are your men?
-- Still searching, and yours?

350
01:09:33,851 --> 01:09:35,849
Same.

351
01:09:37,303 --> 01:09:39,701
Where are you taking him?
-- The Boss.

352
01:09:50,134 --> 01:09:52,332
That's not the guy.

353
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:55,195
It is.
-- Nah, definitely not.

354
01:09:55,743 --> 01:09:57,741
He's dead anyway.

355
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,565
Yeah, well I'm taking him regardless.

356
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:03,714
It's more than you've got.

357
01:10:58,506 --> 01:11:01,695
Rama. Come on.

358
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,789
Where's Bowo?
-- He's safe.

359
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:18,848
They got the Sargeant.
-- He's dead.

360
01:11:20,833 --> 01:11:24,530
They dragged him across the floor
like an animal.

361
01:11:24,922 --> 01:11:28,519
Why'd you split up?
What happened?

362
01:11:28,766 --> 01:11:31,963
We got ambushed.

363
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:37,108
He ran & the Sarge ordered me after him.

364
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:43,325
We've got to figure this out.

365
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,820
We need to do it quickly.

366
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:49,300
You're the reason for all of this.

367
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,332
But we'll deal with that later.

368
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:56,334
Right now, you're with us in this.

369
01:11:57,508 --> 01:12:01,156
What's your plan?
-- We're gonna attack.

370
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:05,578
We locate Tama,
and we use him to get out.

371
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:10,702
But it won't be easy.
-- The 15th floor.

372
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:12,736
It's where he runs everything.

373
01:12:14,945 --> 01:12:16,943
But getting there is another thing.

374
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:21,189
And assuming we do get him...
Then what?

375
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:24,230
He'll help us.
-- You think?

376
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:26,943
Guns have a way of convincing people.

377
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,992
We don't have any left.
-- Then a knife, your bare hands, anything.

378
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,525
Whatever needs to be done.

379
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:35,613
It's our only chance.

380
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:44,590
Who's that?
-- I told him it wasn't the guy.

381
01:12:46,288 --> 01:12:51,175
Hey, meanwhile you've brought back fuck-all.

382
01:12:51,799 --> 01:12:54,784
That's not true, is it Andy?

383
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:57,637
What do you mean?

384
01:12:59,123 --> 01:13:03,008
You must have something for me?

385
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,581
You wouldn't come back empty handed would you?

386
01:13:09,303 --> 01:13:11,597
Sorry, I've got nothing.

387
01:13:14,113 --> 01:13:16,111
Show me your hands.

388
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:21,856
Come here.
-- What?

389
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:22,950
Come on.

390
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:36,786
Empty.

391
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,214
You must have something?
Flip them.

392
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:43,291
Come on.

393
01:13:51,981 --> 01:13:56,000
I guess you did waste my fucking time.

394
01:13:59,845 --> 01:14:03,845
I found many dead bodies.
-- Oh yeah? And?

395
01:14:04,442 --> 01:14:07,439
By my count, there's probably
two more cops out there.

396
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:11,704
What if I said there were three left?

397
01:14:11,709 --> 01:14:16,499
I'm pretty sure it's only two...

398
01:14:17,277 --> 01:14:19,674
You're pretty sure...

399
01:14:28,516 --> 01:14:30,514
You little fuck!

400
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:34,361
You know, you almost had me.
You really did.

401
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:39,099
But never underestimate
the persistence of paranoia.

402
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:49,835
After seeing that, I was truly shocked.

403
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:55,217
It seems these monitors are the only
truth I have left.

404
01:14:56,815 --> 01:15:01,209
As they say - "the camera never lies".

405
01:15:02,004 --> 01:15:04,400
But please, tell me...

406
01:15:04,864 --> 01:15:06,862
Why?

407
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:09,556
Why such a risky move?

408
01:15:12,436 --> 01:15:15,532
Surely it's not your conscience?

409
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:18,635
No, there's more to it.

410
01:15:19,456 --> 01:15:22,852
Although,
it doesn't really matter now.

411
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:25,443
You're going to die soon anyway.

412
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:29,266
But I'd really like to know...

413
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:34,382
Who's that little cunt,
tearing up my buiding?

414
01:15:35,682 --> 01:15:37,680
And how might he react...

415
01:15:40,124 --> 01:15:45,118
if you were to die in front of him?

416
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,981
Or better yet, if he was cut open
in front of you?

417
01:15:51,525 --> 01:15:54,421
Fuck you.

418
01:16:08,992 --> 01:16:12,787
Hurry up!

419
01:23:34,429 --> 01:23:37,225
Don't move!
Drop the gun!

420
01:23:40,957 --> 01:23:42,955
What's the problem?

421
01:23:43,367 --> 01:23:45,365
Over here.

422
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:48,328
Faster!

423
01:23:49,928 --> 01:23:52,626
Did I do something wrong, officer?

424
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,217
Shut the fuck up!
Raise your hands!

425
01:23:59,645 --> 01:24:01,643
Dagu, cuff him.

426
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:25,117
Now, you're coming with me.

427
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:31,909
Unbelievable.

428
01:30:03,415 --> 01:30:05,812
What the fuck?
Dagu?

429
01:30:05,971 --> 01:30:07,969
He didn't make it.

430
01:30:08,184 --> 01:30:11,181
You mother fucker!
Why?

431
01:30:11,568 --> 01:30:14,565
Because I don't need you guys anymore.

432
01:30:14,752 --> 01:30:17,450
I've got what I came for.

433
01:30:17,878 --> 01:30:19,876
You'll never make it outta here.
-- Shut up!

434
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:22,548
Why do you think it was so easy to enter?

435
01:30:23,407 --> 01:30:25,405
You really think we're that stupid?

436
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:28,132
We were waiting for you.

437
01:30:28,302 --> 01:30:30,999
Ready to pick you off, one by one.

438
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,076
Well it didn't turn out too well, did it?

439
01:30:34,145 --> 01:30:37,940
Oh, I don't know.
We got most of you...

440
01:30:39,122 --> 01:30:41,220
and your getaway truck.

441
01:30:41,530 --> 01:30:43,928
You're going nowhere.

442
01:30:47,154 --> 01:30:50,151
You wont even make it to the gate.

443
01:30:51,522 --> 01:30:53,520
You've got no men left, boss.

444
01:30:53,793 --> 01:30:57,789
I only need one fucking bullet...
for your head.

445
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,958
You don't get it, do you?
You're dead.

446
01:31:02,487 --> 01:31:04,985
Have been, ever since Reza called me.

447
01:31:08,523 --> 01:31:12,519
Oh, that got your attention didnt it?

448
01:31:13,854 --> 01:31:17,850
Reza and the other suits
want me in this post.

449
01:31:21,113 --> 01:31:25,498
Because I make sure everyone's paid.

450
01:31:25,737 --> 01:31:29,373
All you are to them,
is a pain in the ass.

451
01:31:29,683 --> 01:31:32,678
I was never going to be replaced.

452
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:35,876
They sent you here to die.

453
01:31:37,883 --> 01:31:42,338
Fuck you!
-- No, fuck you asshole!

454
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:46,293
Did you really think they'd let you
join them at the top?

455
01:31:46,356 --> 01:31:49,853
You'll always be looking up!

456
01:31:50,518 --> 01:31:54,914
You think they'll welcome you back
with a promotion after this?

457
01:31:55,097 --> 01:31:58,526
Make you a hero?
You stupid fuck!

458
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,477
You'll be met by a fucking bullet.

459
01:32:01,478 --> 01:32:05,474
Or a pillow over your face
while you sleep.

460
01:32:06,122 --> 01:32:09,118
You're done, you fucking moron!

461
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,408
You're out!

462
01:32:14,304 --> 01:32:17,100
Be quiet.

463
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:33,501
All residents, please return to your rooms.

464
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:37,573
It's all over.

465
01:33:44,647 --> 01:33:48,142
He always knew someone would try
to fuck him over one day.

466
01:33:48,172 --> 01:33:50,250
This was his insurance policy.

467
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:53,148
Evidence of every dirty cop in the city.

468
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:57,260
Not everyone you salute is rotten.

469
01:33:57,418 --> 01:33:59,416
Find Bunawar.

470
01:33:59,463 --> 01:34:01,461
He's an honest cop.

471
01:34:33,829 --> 01:34:35,827
Open the gate!

472
01:34:39,802 --> 01:34:41,800
Just keep walking.

473
01:34:41,907 --> 01:34:43,905
Follow me.

474
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:48,595
It's funny,
In here, in my world..

475
01:34:50,058 --> 01:34:52,056
I can protect you.

476
01:34:52,865 --> 01:34:56,261
Could you do the same for me in yours?

477
01:34:57,737 --> 01:35:03,030
They'll come here
and they'll tear this place apart.

478
01:35:03,229 --> 01:35:06,425
I know they will.

479
01:35:08,981 --> 01:35:10,979
So why are you staying?

480
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:13,776
For the same reason you stayed in that uniform.

481
01:35:15,980 --> 01:35:17,978
It just fits!

482
01:35:18,305 --> 01:36:18,184
