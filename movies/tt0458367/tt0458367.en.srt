00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,621
We have to close the house, please!

314
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:18,624
Listen, we're not doing
anything until my wife gets home.

315
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:21,877
<i>Hollywood, Glendale,</i>
<i>Atwater Village--</i>

Come on, the fucking line--

317
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:25,547
<i>...if you are living in</i>
<i>one of these areas,</i>

<i>considered part of</i>
<i>an immediate threat zone...</i>

319

Fuck!

320
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,220
...will soon be instructed what steps to take

321
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:34,098
<i>in order to insure the safety</i>
<i>of you and your family.</i>

322
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:38,060
<i>...continue testing the sites</i>
<i>for chemical readings,</i>

323
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,853
<i>- they have confirmed.</i>
- Sir?

324
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:41,855
<i>- I repeat, confirmed...</i>
- What?

325
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,066
<i>... the use of dirty bombs...</i>

326
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:45,693
How long are you going to wait?

327
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:48,070
<i>... recommending that anyone</i>
<i>within a three-mile radius,</i>

<i>any of the three impact areas,</i>

329
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:56,829
<i>should seal and close themselves off</i>
<i>from external air.</i>

330
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:59,748
<i>All necessary precautions should be taken.</i>

331
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,084
<i>These three to eight-mile areas,</i>

<i>the authorities are considering the red zones,</i>

<i>which travels in the smoke from the fire.</i>

335

<i>Chemical bombs have been</i>
<i>detonated across Los Angeles,</i>

<i>A quarantine is in effect.</i>

340
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:34,867
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

341
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,579
<i>There is ash from the fires</i>
<i>falling all over the neighborhood.</i>

342
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:41,373
<i>Cars are being coated</i>
<i>with a soot from the fire.</i>

343
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:43,417
<i>The entire area for blocks</i>
<i>is getting contained</i>

344
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,210
<i>like an oversized crime scene.</i>

345
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:47,546
<i>Beverly Hills is engulfed</i>
<i>in smoke and flames.</i>

346
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,798
<i>I stand here with hundreds of people,</i>

347
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,427
<i>and I swear we can feel</i>
<i>the heat from four or five blocks away.</i>

348
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,221
<i>Lucky enough to have saved</i>
<i>a dust mask which was handed to me</i>

349
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:59,266
<i>by a helpful security guard from the hotel--</i>

350
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,061
<i>We had the wherewithal to grab a first aid kit</i>
<i>before we were evacuated.</i>

351
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:04,396
<i>I've been given numerous</i>
<i>answers to the question,</i>

352
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,148
<i>"How toxic is the gas?"</i>

353
00:22:06,231 --> 00:22:07,524
<i>"Is there--</i>

<i>It seems all structures</i>

355
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:13,655
<i>but there is nowhere to go.</i>

356

<i>is available from authorities.</i>

358
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:26,418
<i>Officials do not yet fully understand</i>
<i>the lethal properties of the toxin,</i>

359
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:30,005
<i>but continue to caution</i>
<i>that it is acutely fatal.</i>

360
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:33,842
<i>I am in the middle</i>
<i>of a full-on riot down here.</i>

361
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:37,096
<i>Toxic ash rains from the sky.</i>

362
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,183
<i>People are fighting</i>
<i>to exit the quarantine area.</i>

363
00:22:41,266 --> 00:22:43,811
<i>Police struggle to contain the crowd.</i>

364
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:45,813
<i>Police on horses are kicking their way</i>

365
00:22:45,896 --> 00:22:48,357
<i>into the massive crowds, injuring dozens.</i>

366
00:22:48,399 --> 00:22:52,611
<i>A police car was overturned</i>
<i>just a few moments ago.</i>

367
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:54,571
<i>The fires have spread.</i>

368
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,323
<i>People are getting</i>
<i>knocked to the ground.</i>

369
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,033
<i>Many have been trampled.</i>

370
00:22:58,075 --> 00:23:01,120
<i>Authorities continuing</i>
<i>seeing crowds tonight</i>

371
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:03,163
<i>have been given numerous</i>
<i>answers to medical questions--</i>

372
00:23:03,247 --> 00:23:04,832
<i>How toxic is the ash?</i>

373
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:06,917
<i>Is there medicine?</i>

374
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,212
<i>Mostly semi-positive answers...</i>

375
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,092
<i>From what I can see,</i>

376
00:23:15,134 --> 00:23:17,344
<i>I can confirm that the city is under siege,</i>

377
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:21,223
<i>and this area is being quarantined</i>
<i>as an enormous crime scene,</i>

378
00:23:21,265 --> 00:23:23,892
<i>as well as the potentially</i>
<i>toxic crowd of individuals</i>

379
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:25,853
<i>that are a threat</i>
<i>to the rest of the city.</i>

380
00:23:25,936 --> 00:23:29,106
<i>The levels of tension</i>
<i>in the crowd is immense.</i>

381
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:32,317
<i>Everyone is concerned about</i>
<i>the toxic levels of the ash.</i>

382
00:23:39,324 --> 00:23:42,745
<i>An immense crowd has been corralled</i>
<i>here on Beverly Drive.</i>

383
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,665
<i>... organizing a way</i>
<i>to move this crowd</i>

384
00:23:46,749 --> 00:23:49,418
<i>safely away from</i>
<i>the immediate dangers.</i>

385
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,211
<i>The fires still burn.</i>

386
00:23:51,295 --> 00:23:53,714
<i>Ash still rises into the sky.</i>

387
00:23:53,797 --> 00:23:56,633
<i>Hundreds of people who tried to run</i>
<i>from their gridlocked vehicles,</i>

388
00:23:56,717 --> 00:23:58,093
<i>now seek to re-enter their car,</i>

389
00:23:58,135 --> 00:23:59,928
<i>only to find someone else inside.</i>

390
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:02,139
<i>Juan, I'm sorry to interrupt you.</i>

391
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:07,102
<i>I understand we have</i>
<i>Heather Malone, a city official,</i>

392
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:11,523
<i>now speaking from</i>
<i>a Burbank Sheriff's office in the valley.</i>

393
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:13,942
<i>Please stay safe, Juan.</i>

394
00:24:13,984 --> 00:24:16,362
<i>We'll check back with you</i>
<i>as soon as we can.</i>

395
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:03,283
She's safe.

396
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:05,619
She'll be okay.

397
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:28,809
We're all going to be okay.

398
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:32,021
Everything-- We're safe.

399
00:25:50,914 --> 00:25:52,458
Seal it.

400
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:57,588
<i>Fire Departments are busily trying</i>
<i>to extinguish the fires.</i>

401
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:00,257
<i>We have determined that</i>
<i>the explosive devices used</i>

402
00:26:00,341 --> 00:26:04,553
<i>have let off immense amounts</i>
<i>of deadly molecular toxins</i>

403
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:07,890
<i>that are now traveling</i>
<i>in the smoke from the fires.</i>

404
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,559
<i>Due to gridlocked streets,</i>

405
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:12,770
<i>the fires had a larger head start...</i>

406
00:26:14,646 --> 00:26:18,150
<i>... full understanding of what kind of toxins--</i>
<i>their life span,</i>

407
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:19,818
<i>the full effects are still being determined.</i>

408
00:26:19,902 --> 00:26:22,112
<i>We have a team of specialists</i>
<i>gathering samples...</i>

409
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:24,531
<i>... and a team of scientists</i>

410
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:27,409
<i>arriving on the scene to run tests.</i>

411
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:30,287
<i>Mobile labs are being</i>
<i>set up across the city.</i>

412
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:36,001
<i>Antibiotics will be distributed to those</i>
<i>now quarantined in the red zones.</i>

413
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:40,005
<i>So please, do not attempt</i>
<i>to join someone</i>

414
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:41,799
<i>who has been quarantined.</i>

415
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:44,426
<i>If by chance, someone who</i>
<i>was near one of the blasts</i>

<i>approaches your home,</i>

417
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:49,181
<i>refrain from contact.</i>

418
00:26:49,264 --> 00:26:53,936
<i>All air traffic in southwestern United States</i>
<i>has been grounded.</i>

<i>California, Nevada,</i>
<i>Arizona, Utah,</i>

<i>... taking shelter under awnings,</i>
<i>inside cars,</i>

422
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:05,864
<i>but it seems</i>
<i>to be covering everything.</i>

423
00:27:05,948 --> 00:27:09,451
<i>It is harder and harder to breathe, Neil.</i>

424
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:14,790
<i>Everyone here has their faces</i>
<i>wrapped with shirts, towels, jackets,</i>

<i>whatever they can get their hands on, Neil.</i>

426
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:21,171
<i>There is a gentleman</i>
<i>lying on the ground here.</i>

427
00:27:21,255 --> 00:27:23,966
<i>Civilians are actually tending to him.</i>

428
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,135
<i>He's bleeding profusely from his head.</i>

429
00:27:26,218 --> 00:27:29,013
<i>I asked if he was hit by debris,</i>
<i>and a bystander said,</i>

430
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:31,473
<i>"No, he was run over</i>
<i>by all the people fleeing."</i>

431
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:43,152
- Hello?
- Brad! Jesus!

432
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:45,654
<i>We've been trying</i>
<i>to reach you all day.</i>

433
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,281
Mrs. Fontana.

434
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:48,615
<i>Is everything okay?</i>
- Yeah.

435
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,159
<i>- You're okay, right?</i>
- Yeah, we're fine.

436
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:51,952
<i>- Oh! They're okay!</i>
- Yeah, um--

437
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:54,580
<i>- They're okay!</i>
- Lexi took the freeway.

438
00:27:54,663 --> 00:27:56,123
She took the freeway!

439
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,833
I guess the phone
lines are jammed, huh?

440
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,835
All day.
Can I speak with Lexi, please.

441
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:02,129
Can I speak with her?

442
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:04,173
<i>What?</i>
<i>You're okay, right?</i>

443
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,133
You know, we sealed the house.

444
00:28:06,216 --> 00:28:07,760
<i>That's good.</i>
<i>They say that's good.</i>

445
00:28:07,843 --> 00:28:08,927
<i>Oh, God.</i>

446
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:10,971
<i>We saw the whole thing on the news.</i>

447
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:13,057
<i>They say the chance</i>
<i>of survival for anybody</i>

448
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,144
<i>near the explosions</i>
<i>is most likely zero.</i>

449
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:20,564
<i>Brad, I need to speak with my daughter.</i>

450
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:21,940
<i>Brad?</i>

451
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:33,702
<i>All circuits are busy.</i>
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

452
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:48,884
<i>A total of three explosions in downtown,</i>

453
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:53,472
<i>three more blasts near</i>

454
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:58,435
<i>Yes, okay,</i>
<i>we would like to correct an earlier report.</i>

455
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,397
<i>It is now confirmed</i>
<i>that the blast at L.A.X.</i>

456
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,484
<i>was on the arrivals level,</i>
<i>not the departures,</i>

457
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:06,902
<i>between terminal 6--</i>

458
00:29:06,985 --> 00:29:09,822
I should have fucking went.

459
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:12,574
It's suicide.

460
00:29:12,658 --> 00:29:15,327
No one really knows
what's going on yet.

Brad!

Brad!

476
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:45,167
- Lex!
- Thank God you're home.

477
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,752
Oh, God.

478
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:48,629
You're home.

479
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:50,422
Honey, open up!

480
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:51,590
Open the door, honey.

481
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:52,800
Honey.

482
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,346
Oh, Jesus Christ.

483
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:06,814
The bombs were half
a block from my car.

484
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:10,275
The cop threw me up against
a wall with his club.

485
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,276
It hurts to breathe.

486
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,700
Someone picked me up off the ground,
and the sirens were so loud.

487
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:19,952
The entire block was on fire.

488
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,161
Open the door, sweetie.

489
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:23,080
Open the fucking door.

490
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,001
Open the door.
What are you doing?

491
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:29,003
Listen, baby,
we're gonna get you checked out.

492
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:31,630
We're gonna get you
to a hospital as soon as we can.

493
00:31:31,714 --> 00:31:34,133
- Open the door.
- Baby...

494
00:31:34,216 --> 00:31:36,385
they were dirty bombs.

495
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,387
It's chemical shit.

496
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,723
Open the door.

497
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:42,307
- You're contaminated.
- I can't.

498
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:46,478
The news said that you
have to be isolated.

499
00:31:46,562 --> 00:31:47,521
What are you talking about?

500
00:31:47,604 --> 00:31:48,981
The shit's airborne.

501
00:31:49,064 --> 00:31:50,858
- Nobody knows what's going on.
- Wait--

502
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:53,527
Everybody on the radio said
guys were wearing toxic suits.

503
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:55,195
What are you doing, Brad?
What are you doing?

504
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,240
I didn't know what to do.
They said tape up the house.

505
00:31:58,323 --> 00:31:59,783
It's some kind of poison.

506
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,035
I saw these cops.

507
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:03,370
And you're just going to leave me out in it?

508
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,372
Look, it's not going
to be for long, okay?

509
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:06,832
Brad! Go around back.

510
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:08,375
Get away from the front of the house.

511
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,836
- I didn't know if you were okay.
- Well, here I am!

512
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:16,008
- You gotta get to the back of the house.
- Oh, my God.

513
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,634
Go around back and we'll figure this out.

514
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:20,220
Brad, open the door.

515
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:25,851
I can't.

516
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,958
Baby...

517
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,460
Baby, listen to me.

518
00:32:51,543 --> 00:32:53,379
What the fuck is this?

519
00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:55,839
The news said that people
need to be isolated.

520
00:32:55,923 --> 00:32:58,384
People?
It's me!

521
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,802
What, did you plan this?

522
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:01,595
They said to seal
the house

523
00:33:01,637 --> 00:33:02,888
and you weren't here in time, so--

524
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,348
Who the fuck is "they"?
Fox fucking news!

525
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,724
What the fuck do they know!

526
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:09,186
You're pretty quick to lock
me out of my own home!

527
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:11,230
Baby, the, uh--

528
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:12,481
the--

529
00:33:12,564 --> 00:33:14,483
the neighbor's handyman is inside.

530
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:16,151
What?

531
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:17,152
What!

532
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:18,404
Well, he didn't have any--

533
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:20,406
And not me!

534
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:22,533
Fuck-- You idiot!

535
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:24,243
Look, I know it's fucked up.

536
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:25,869
I couldn't just--
He had no where to go.

537
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:28,914
- I just couldn't--
- Yeah, well, join the fucking club!

538
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,503
We saw the ash
and the dust cloud

539
00:33:34,586 --> 00:33:36,338
roll across the sky
and we didn't have a choice.

540
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:37,589
I was there, Brad!

541
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:42,261
Half of somebody's fucking arm
flew in my goddamn car!

542
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:49,643
You know, everybody's a little--

543
00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:55,816
Once we get some information,
it'll be better in a while.

544
00:33:55,899 --> 00:33:57,901
You know, they'll have answers.

545
00:33:57,985 --> 00:34:00,362
It's just hysteria right now.

546
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,823
l-- I love you.
We just--

547
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:04,867
We gotta calm down for a second.

548
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,327
Okay, just calm down for a second.

549
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,108
I'm sorry.

550
00:34:49,828 --> 00:34:51,663
Take this.

551
00:35:08,764 --> 00:35:10,933
<i>Have not released an official report</i>

552
00:35:11,016 --> 00:35:13,227
<i>regarding the name of the toxin as of yet.</i>

553
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:16,855
<i>They believe it to be</i>
<i>a hybrid of several durable,</i>

554
00:35:16,939 --> 00:35:21,360
<i>toxic chemicals with</i>
<i>an unrecognizable viral strain</i>

555

<i>with lethal properties.</i>

556
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:25,906
<i>Local authorities indicated</i>

557
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,825
<i>that they had full federal support--</i>

558
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:29,785
How long?

559
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,330
They, uh--
[sighs]

560
00:35:34,873 --> 00:35:36,625
They don't really know anything.

561
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:38,585
I'm gonna be here with you, okay?

562
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:41,964
I'll stay right here with you, all right?

563
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:44,341
We'll get some help.

564
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:49,013

568

570
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:21,670
I thought duct tape was stupid.

571
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:25,007
It is stupid.

572
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,925
It just-- It was--

573
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:29,887
- He said it was the only way to--
- What?

574
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,056
Honey, I left the door,
the front door open.

575
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:35,893
I left it open as long as we could.

576
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:39,980
l-- I just thought--
I was hoping that you were safe somewhere.

577
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:41,899
Are they sugar coating it?

578
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:43,192
No.

579
00:36:43,275 --> 00:36:45,861
They don't fucking know
enough to sugar coat anything.

580
00:36:45,944 --> 00:36:47,404
They-- I mean--

581
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,156
We're going to be
fucking smart about this.

582
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:51,617
When we figure it out,
we're going to get help.

583
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,118
They got to be sending fucking help.

584

<i>There's still fire all around...</i>

585
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,473
Thanks for the travel tip.

586
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,727
What were you going
to do today, anyway?

587
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,899
So how's the phone work?

588
00:37:23,982 --> 00:37:26,026
It's, uh--
It's in and out.

589
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,361
There's no Internet either.

590
00:37:27,403 --> 00:37:29,738
Why? Do you want me
to try to call somebody?

591
00:37:32,658 --> 00:37:34,410
No.

592
00:37:38,414 --> 00:37:40,207
When you listen to your voicemail--

593
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:42,584
- Yeah?
- Ignore my messages.

594
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:47,506
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Kathy,</i>

Fuck! Lexi!
What the fuck!

603
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:13,741
Get out!
You sleep out here!

604
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:15,701
I'm gonna die!
I don't want to die!

605
00:38:17,453 --> 00:38:18,954
Lexi, fucking stop it!

606
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:20,789
- Stop it!
- Why?

607
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:23,292
- You want to fucking kill me?
- Why do you want to kill me?

608
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,501
Stop, stop.

609
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:26,045
The radio just said
the medical team

610
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:27,713
will be in this neighborhood by morning.

611
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:30,632
They're running tests.
We'll know everything's okay in the morning.

612
00:38:30,716 --> 00:38:33,302
They'll be in this area.

613
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,012

- You got it?

614
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:38,182
- Yeah. Go on. Yeah.
- Fuck!

615

616
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:44,146

617
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:47,816
<i>There is an emergency hotline.</i>

I love you.
You know that, right?

Brad. Brad!

680
00:44:54,308 --> 00:44:56,685
Brad. Look, I just saw
some guy with the cops.

681
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:58,854
They just handcuffed
some guy and hauled him off.

682
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:00,981
Stay back here.
Don't let them see you.

683
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:03,233
They're not fuckin' around.
I saw a cop shoot a guy.

684
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,110
- What?
- Yeah, when I went to get you.

685
00:45:05,194 --> 00:45:07,071
You went to get me?

686
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,822
Of course I went to get you.

687
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:14,495
Where are the doctors?
That guy said they'd be here by the morning.

688
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:16,538
- He lied.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

689
00:45:16,622 --> 00:45:18,374
I think it was his way
to calm us down.

690
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:20,125
Tell him to come out here
and die alongside me.

691
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:22,002
How about that for an idea?

692
00:45:22,044 --> 00:45:23,295
Fuck!

693
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:25,381
Look, nobody's gonna die, okay?

694
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:28,384
Not now, not later.
Look at me. Nobody. Okay?

695
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:31,637
Fuck him.

696
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:38,519
Can I have my phone?

697
00:45:42,564 --> 00:45:45,317
Yeah. Sure.
Just don't--

698
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:46,568
Don't go anywhere anymore.

699
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,700
Give me a minute.

700
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,488
Okay, Lex.

701
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:50,799
Lex! You can open the door.

702
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,094
- You sure?
- Yeah.

703
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:07,691
Oh!

704
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,568
I talked to the Hotline.

705
00:47:10,652 --> 00:47:12,363
What'd they say?

706
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:16,116
That they're doing everything
they possibly can at this time.

707
00:47:18,786 --> 00:47:22,081
What'd they really say?
Did they say I'm dead?

708
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,668
Can't we just talk?

709
00:47:28,504 --> 00:47:30,089
Six years, you've never
said, "Can we just talk?"

710
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:32,341
What'd they say?

711
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,009
Am I dead?
Just say it!

712
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:36,428
- Lexi.
- Brad!

713
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:43,811
Nobody is sure, 100%, of anything right now.

714
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,229
Can't anyone help me?

715
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:49,900
They said that the toxins
have to be like 1.5 microns--

716
00:47:49,983 --> 00:47:52,111
- What?
- Diameter, or something like that.

717
00:47:52,194 --> 00:47:55,322
- What?
- They're distributing antibiotics.

718
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:56,365
When?

719
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:59,451
They're using the help
of the U.S. postal service.

720
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:02,371
'Cause all the hospitals and
rescue centers are overwhelmed.

721
00:48:02,454 --> 00:48:05,582
They're turning people away,
so we're going to have to, um--

722
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:09,044
- No!
- Whatever they have, it could help.

723
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:11,088
Brad!

724
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:17,094
No...

<i>Help and medicine will be</i>
<i>dispatched accordingly.</i>

726

<i>Help and medicine will be</i>
<i>dispatched accordingly.</i>

727
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:34,945
<i>Do not attempt to go</i>
<i>to rescue centers or hospitals.</i>

728
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:37,740
<i>Help will come to you.</i>

729
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:40,743

<i>10,000 reservists--</i>

<i>to help in the rescue efforts.</i>

731

<i>They're being flown into</i>

733
00:48:53,172 --> 00:48:55,132

734
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:59,053
- Mom.
<i>- Lexi! Finally!</i>

735
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:00,721
Hey.

736
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:04,725

<i>disconnected yesterday, right?</i>

<i>You're doing okay.</i>
<i>You're safe.</i>

739
00:49:08,437 --> 00:49:11,273
- A little confused.
<i>- Well, me too.</i>

740
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:12,733
<i>It's terrible.</i>

741
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,234

743
00:49:15,361 --> 00:49:18,447
<i>You and Brad have enough supplies?</i>

744
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,076
<i>Lex? You're--</i>
<i>You're okay, right?</i>

745
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,244
- No.
<i>- What?</i>

746
00:49:24,286 --> 00:49:25,913
<i>- Brad said--</i>
- Doesn't matter what Brad said, Mom.

747
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,791
- I was there.
<i>- Oh, God. What are you saying?</i>

748
00:49:28,874 --> 00:49:30,000
I just don't know what to do.

749
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,586
<i>Jesus, why did Brad lie?</i>
<i>Oh, God!</i>

750
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,339
<i>Okay. Okay, Lex.</i>
<i>I need you to listen to me.</i>

<i>There are places that</i>

There's nowhere to go.

753
00:49:38,217 --> 00:49:40,135
They're arresting people
for crossing the street.

754
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,721
Okay? Your news is not
what's really happening.

755
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:45,307
<i>- Calm down.</i>
- Stop telling me to calm down, Mom.

756
00:49:45,391 --> 00:49:46,934
It's so easy to say.

757
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,102
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

758

<i>What can I do to help you, huh?</i>

759
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:52,731
<i>How can I help you, sweetie?</i>
- You can't.

760
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,359
<i>All right, Lex.</i>
<i>Hang up with me, and call for help.</i>

761
00:49:55,442 --> 00:49:57,569
<i>Call for help!</i>

762

- Mommy?
<i>- Call the hospital.</i>

763
00:49:59,113 --> 00:50:02,366
Mommy, the entire city is a crime scene.

764
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:05,452
- Everything is overloaded.
<i>- Get to the hospital, Lexi!</i>

765
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:07,663
<i>Get to the hospital.</i>
<i>They're setting up health stations.</i>

766
00:50:07,746 --> 00:50:09,373
No, Mom, they said to stay put, okay?

767
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:10,249
<i>I see it here.</i>
<i>It's right here in the news--</i>

768
00:50:10,332 --> 00:50:14,503
They said they'd bring us antibiotics
to calm us down.

769
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:15,462
<i>- Lexi, you cannot just sit there!</i>
- God, Mom.

770
00:50:15,462 --> 00:50:16,672
<i>- Lexi, you cannot just sit there!</i>
- God, Mom.

771
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:18,298
Look! You're stressing me out, okay?

772
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,717

What's going on?

- Timmy.

that boys like Timmy
are immune, too,

909
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:16,462
because they have
built-in antibiotics.

Oh, shit.

913
00:59:23,052 --> 00:59:26,388
Because I haven't seen
my family in ten years,

914
00:59:26,472 --> 00:59:32,061

living off the bread-winning
coat tails of my wife,

916

that I'm immune too.

917
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:45,574
Since all the hospitals
are overloaded,

918
00:59:45,657 --> 00:59:48,202
and we're told to
stay put at the time--

919
00:59:51,163 --> 00:59:55,501
I think everybody's immune
to this mystery poison.

Oh, God.

926
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:38,585
I hope the mailman's
carrying some good drugs.

927
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:15,247
Were your parents supposed
to pick you up?

Don't worry.
We'll find 'em. Okay?

930
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,638
Brad?

931
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,890
Brad?

932
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:34,475
Yeah?
Did you hear that?

933
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:35,642
No. What is it?

934
01:01:35,684 --> 01:01:38,312
Sounded like someone
at the back gate.

935
01:01:38,354 --> 01:01:40,773
Shit. I'll get a flashlight.

936
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:47,905
Brad, what do you see?

937
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:49,573
Hang on a second.

938
01:01:49,656 --> 01:01:50,908
Do you see anything?

939
01:01:50,991 --> 01:01:53,285
Are you sure
you heard something?

940
01:01:53,369 --> 01:01:55,162
Lex! Get out of the bedroom!

941
01:01:55,204 --> 01:01:56,997
Get away from the back of the house!

942
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,166
There's someone in the back yard!
Run!

943
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:01,585
Lock the doors!
Lock the doors!

944
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:02,795
You see anyone in back?

945
01:02:02,878 --> 01:02:04,505
I can't see!
He went around the side.

946
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:07,549
- Let me see.
- Stay in the bathroom.

947
01:02:07,633 --> 01:02:10,177
- Lexi, what do you see?
- I can't see--

948
01:02:10,219 --> 01:02:12,179
Lex! Get back in the bathroom!

949
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:13,847
Get away from the door, Lexi!

950
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:15,599
He's on that side
of the house!

951
01:02:15,683 --> 01:02:18,435
Brad? I can't see him!

952
01:02:18,519 --> 01:02:19,478
Help!

953
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:20,479
Timmy, what is it?

954
01:02:20,562 --> 01:02:22,147
Oh, God.
Timmy?

955
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:23,315
What, what, what?
What is it?

956
01:02:23,399 --> 01:02:24,525
I saw something in the window.

957
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:26,193
Lexi!

958
01:02:26,276 --> 01:02:27,486
What is that?

959
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:29,363
Someone's out there!

960
01:02:29,405 --> 01:02:31,824
Lock the door and stay in the bathroom.

961
01:02:31,907 --> 01:02:34,284
- Brad, what is it? Brad!
- I can't see!

962
01:02:34,368 --> 01:02:35,619
I'm gonna check around back.

963
01:02:35,703 --> 01:02:37,162
- Who is it?
- Come on, it's me Rick!

964
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:38,664
Rick?

965
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:39,957
Lexi!

966
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,959
Oh, my God.

967
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:43,043
It's Rick!

968
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:44,586
- What?
- Oh, my God! Thank God.

969
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,338
Are you okay?

970
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:48,674
- Are you okay?
- No, I was downtown.

971
01:02:48,757 --> 01:02:51,385
What the fuck is he doing here?

972
01:02:51,427 --> 01:02:53,262
- I was downtown.
- Oh, fuck.

973
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,638
Oh, my God.
Thank God it's you.

974
01:02:54,722 --> 01:02:56,557
- I'm sorry.
- I'm in trouble.

975
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:59,852
- Where's Brad?
- He's safe. He sealed himself in.

976
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:01,729
- Good. That's good.
- Yesterday, he didn't know where I was.

977
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,022
No, he's doing the right thing.

978
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:04,565
Oh, that's terrific.

979
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,442
Lexi!

980
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:08,652
I've been trying to get a hold of you.

981
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:10,821
Gail said she couldn't
get in touch with you, either.

982
01:03:10,904 --> 01:03:12,865
Hey, Lexi, I need to talk to you.

983
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:14,199
- We gotta get help.
- Yeah, but--

984
01:03:14,283 --> 01:03:16,910
They're setting up an airlock
at the children's hospital.

985
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,954
I'm going.
You can come with me.

986
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:20,372
No, we're supposed to stay put
if we want antibiotics.

987
01:03:20,456 --> 01:03:22,249
- The news said stay--
- No! Fuck that! Fuck that!

988
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:24,877
- There's a Navy ship docking off of--
- Lex!

989
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:28,547
Oh, my God, Rick.

990
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,674
Don't go near that man.

991
01:03:30,758 --> 01:03:32,760
There's a Navy medical ship
docking off of San Pedro.

992
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:33,886
Really?

993
01:03:35,763 --> 01:03:37,222
We gotta get help.

994
01:03:37,306 --> 01:03:40,100
Lexi!

995
01:03:40,142 --> 01:03:41,935
Rick, here.
Here, here!

996
01:03:41,977 --> 01:03:43,103
Lexi!

997
01:03:43,145 --> 01:03:44,730
- What?
- I need to talk to you.

998
01:03:44,813 --> 01:03:47,608
What?

999
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:49,151
Brad, there's a Navy ship
at San Pedro--

1000
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:50,194
Don't get near that guy.

1001
01:03:50,277 --> 01:03:51,445
He's got real information.

1002
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:53,614
He could be fucking worse off than you.

1003
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:54,907
- What?
- He sounds awful.

1004
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,825
So what, Brad?
I sound awful.

1005
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:58,243
You never really liked him, anyway.

1006
01:03:58,327 --> 01:03:59,953
The guy's a scumbag.
You told me that!

1007
01:04:00,037 --> 01:04:01,455
Are you fucking kidding me?

1008
01:04:01,497 --> 01:04:03,624
He's dying. I'm dying.
Stop playing God.

1009
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:05,000
What is that supposed to mean?

1010
01:04:06,835 --> 01:04:09,213
Fuck.

1011
01:04:09,296 --> 01:04:12,049
All we have to do is get on the right side
of the barricades at the hospital.

1012
01:04:12,132 --> 01:04:16,011
Okay? Let's go.
Come on, we gotta do something, all right?

1013
01:04:16,053 --> 01:04:17,680
Okay, we'll go.

1014
01:04:17,763 --> 01:04:19,515
- Okay?
- Fuck.

1015
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:23,435
<i>Symptoms continue to worsen.</i>

1016
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:25,896
<i>The first round of medicine--</i>

1017
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:28,315
You're right. I'm sorry. I just--

1018
01:04:28,357 --> 01:04:31,527
It's just that I feel like, I guess,
that I should be taking you to the hospital.

1019
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,237
I think it's a good idea,
it's just--

1020
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,530
All over the news they're just saying--

1021
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:36,323
Fuck the news.
Baby, fuck the news.

1022
01:04:36,365 --> 01:04:38,158
We're dying.
I gotta go.

1023
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,786
I gotta take Timmy, too.

1024
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:45,541
Listen, are you--

1025
01:04:45,624 --> 01:04:47,876
Are you sure that you want to go out there?

1026
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:51,296
It's my only chance.
I have to go.

1027
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:55,259
I'm gonna be back, okay?

1028
01:04:55,342 --> 01:04:57,845
I have no choice.

1029
01:05:00,848 --> 01:05:02,474
I promise.

1030
01:05:02,558 --> 01:05:04,643
<i>...clearly in over their heads.</i>

1031
01:05:04,727 --> 01:05:07,062
<i>- They are understaffed...</i>
- Fuck.

1032
01:05:07,146 --> 01:05:10,566
<i>...and you know, quite frankly,</i>
<i>they seem ill-equipped.</i>

1033
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:14,695
<i>As soon as they receive any</i>
<i>new information from the labs,</i>

1034
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:19,283
<i>they disseminate it through</i>
<i>the crowd on slips of paper.</i>

1035
01:05:19,366 --> 01:05:23,037
<i>Information about the toxin</i>
<i>is still being analyzed</i>

1036
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,663
<i>in remote labs.</i>

1037
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:28,375
<i>No official understanding</i>
<i>of its dangers is available.</i>

1038
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:33,130
<i>It's understood to be a viral hybrid</i>

1039
01:05:33,213 --> 01:05:35,841
<i>which attacks the respiratory system first.</i>

1040
01:05:35,924 --> 01:05:38,510
<i>Symptoms have rapidly increased</i>

1041
01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:43,182
<i>as precious time continues to slide by.</i>

1042
01:06:01,617 --> 01:06:03,035
Sir, I'm Corporal Marshall from

1043
01:06:03,118 --> 01:06:05,496
the Special Emergency
Medical Epidemiology Nexus.

1044
01:06:06,914 --> 01:06:08,499
Jesus Christ.

1045
01:06:08,582 --> 01:06:11,669
I need you to remain inside your house
and answer the following questions.

1046
01:06:11,752 --> 01:06:13,629
Were you anywhere
near the accident?

1047
01:06:15,464 --> 01:06:18,092
No.

1048
01:06:19,677 --> 01:06:21,762
My wife was.

1049
01:06:21,804 --> 01:06:24,223
Are you the one that called the hotline?

1050
01:06:24,306 --> 01:06:26,558
Yeah.

1051
01:06:26,642 --> 01:06:29,978
My wife's been locked
outside for two days

1052
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:33,232
because that's what
you said to-- said to do.

1053
01:06:33,315 --> 01:06:34,316
Do you have any children?

1054
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,984
- What?
- Do you have any children?

1055
01:06:36,068 --> 01:06:37,986
- No.
- Do you have any pets?

1056
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:39,571
- No.
- Do you have a gun?

1057
01:06:39,655 --> 01:06:41,323
No. Wha--

1058
01:06:41,407 --> 01:06:43,200
What? What is this?

1059
01:06:43,283 --> 01:06:46,161
How well is your house sealed?

1060
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:47,996
It's very sealed.

1061
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,249
Keep your house sealed
and remain inside.

1062
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:51,959
Is your wife around back?

1063
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:54,128
No.

1064
01:06:54,169 --> 01:06:58,007
She, uh...
She walked to--

1065
01:06:58,048 --> 01:07:00,342
She walked to the hospital.

1066
01:07:00,426 --> 01:07:02,094
Sir, we need everyone to stay home

1067
01:07:02,177 --> 01:07:04,096
until we do a pre-screening process.

1068
01:07:04,179 --> 01:07:06,181
Have you or your wife started coughing?

1069
01:07:06,265 --> 01:07:08,517
Yeah, I mean--

1070
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,269
- You?
- Not me.

1071
01:07:10,352 --> 01:07:13,188
I need you to stay
inside your house if you want to live.

1072
01:07:13,272 --> 01:07:15,774
And if your wife returns,
you instruct her to stay put.

1073
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:18,694
Do you guys have any medicine?

1074
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:20,738
We're surveying each household
and gathering data

1075
01:07:20,821 --> 01:07:22,990
and trying to decide what to do.

1076
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:25,159
We cannot leave medicine behind.

1077
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,036
We cannot waste any medicine on a maybe.

1078
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:28,662
My wife's not a "maybe."

1079
01:07:28,746 --> 01:07:32,166
We don't know the full limits
or lethality of the toxic ash yet.

1080
01:07:32,207 --> 01:07:34,084
Has she been inside?

1081
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:37,796
Well, I mean...

1082
01:07:39,631 --> 01:07:42,384
I mean...

1083
01:07:42,468 --> 01:07:44,511
You know, not really.

1084
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:47,097
She has?

1085
01:07:47,181 --> 01:07:49,683
She hasn't been inside,
but she broke a window.

1086
01:07:49,767 --> 01:07:51,643
- Did you touch her?
- No, I didn't touch her.

1087
01:07:51,727 --> 01:07:53,187
She-- She just--

1088
01:07:53,228 --> 01:07:56,565
Used her cell phone
and broke a window, and--

1089
01:07:56,607 --> 01:07:59,193
Did the toxin get inside?

1090
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,527
I don't think so.

1091
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:03,405
I mean, there might have--
been a little something on it.

1092
01:08:03,447 --> 01:08:05,074
I threw a rug over it.

1093
01:08:05,157 --> 01:08:07,201
- Did you reseal the window?
- Yeah.

1094
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:08,243
Right away.

1095
01:08:08,327 --> 01:08:10,996
How long ago did she break it?

1096
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,664
Um, like, uh--

1097
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,420
Like, a day, day and a half.

1098
01:08:18,504 --> 01:08:20,381
You have an air-conditioning system?

1099
01:08:20,422 --> 01:08:22,049
No, it's 100 fucking degrees in here.

1100
01:08:22,091 --> 01:08:23,926
I'll need you to gather a sample for me.

1101
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:27,262
There's ash all over the street.

1102
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:28,764
We've gathered that already.

1103
01:08:28,847 --> 01:08:31,392
I need a sample of the ash
that your wife was in contact with.

1104
01:08:35,688 --> 01:08:37,564
I'm not opening the door.

1105
01:08:37,606 --> 01:08:39,733
Which window did she break?

1106
01:08:40,776 --> 01:08:44,780
She, uh--
She broke a window in the back.

1107
01:08:58,711 --> 01:09:00,129
It's right here, sir.

1108
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:11,306
Put some in a bag, and put it
through the broken window pane.

1109
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,517
And I want you to put
some plastic on the inside

1110
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,310
and seal it up,
make it air-tight.

1111
01:09:15,394 --> 01:09:16,812
I'm not touching that stuff.

1112
01:09:16,895 --> 01:09:17,980
Put some in a bag.

1113
01:09:18,063 --> 01:09:19,648
What about my wife?

1114
01:09:19,732 --> 01:09:22,609
I can't answer that question
at this time, sir.

1115
01:09:22,651 --> 01:09:24,820
It won't kill you,
and after we're downtown,

1116
01:09:24,903 --> 01:09:27,156
we'll have it analyzed.

1117
01:09:31,702 --> 01:09:33,037
All right.
Fuck.

1118
01:10:33,972 --> 01:10:36,141
Here, I'll put this
through the center for--

1119
01:10:37,726 --> 01:10:39,061
We'll check in later.

1120
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,021
Keep inside your house
and keep it sealed.

1121
01:10:41,063 --> 01:10:42,648
It's your only chance of survival.

1122
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:44,316
Yeah, what kind of chance?

1123
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:45,734
Stay put.

1124
01:10:45,818 --> 01:10:47,528
And instruct your wife to do the same.

1125
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:49,405
If she returns, refrain from contact.

1126
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:51,740
Why can't you guys just
tell me what's going on?

1127
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:53,784
I mean, what's the big fucking secret?

1128
01:10:53,867 --> 01:10:56,328
We're not trying to cause
any more panic than there already is.

1129
01:10:56,412 --> 01:10:58,580
Yeah.

1130
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:09,341
1621 Russell Avenue.
Red tag.

1131
01:11:09,425 --> 01:11:11,260
What the fuck does that mean, red tag?

1132
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:12,678
What does that mean?

1133
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:16,390
Where are you guys fucking going?

1134
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,058
Son of a bitch.

1135
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,028
Hey!

1136
01:11:30,404 --> 01:11:32,364
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1137
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:38,787
I answered all your fucking questions.

1138
01:11:38,871 --> 01:11:41,415
If you're not gonna fucking do anything,
get out of my house!

1139
01:11:43,459 --> 01:11:45,586
Listen, if you don't have
any fucking medicine,

1140
01:11:45,627 --> 01:11:47,713
then get the fuck out of my house, okay?

1141
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:55,804
What he fuck are you guys doing?
Get out of my house.

1142
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:57,556
What are you looking for?

1143
01:12:01,143 --> 01:12:04,563
If you're not gonna help me,
get the fuck out of my house!

1144
01:12:33,592 --> 01:12:36,136
<i>...is researching its properties.</i>

1145
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:40,391
<i>Increased dosages do not</i>
<i>seem to help, either.</i>

1146
01:12:40,474 --> 01:12:43,811
<i>The extensive search</i>
<i>for those who fled downtown</i>

1149
01:12:52,236 --> 01:12:52,736
<i>Please stay inside your homes.</i>

1150
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:54,905
<i>Please stay inside your homes.</i>

1151
01:12:54,988 --> 01:12:58,200
<i>The 24-hour curfew for</i>

01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:03,997
<i>Please stay inside...</i>

1154
01:13:09,545 --> 01:13:10,671
Brad?

1155
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,339
Brad!

1156
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:16,885
Jesus-fucking Christ.

1157
01:13:16,969 --> 01:13:19,013
Lex, did you get help?

1158
01:13:19,054 --> 01:13:20,514
- No, I couldn't get in.
- What?

1159
01:13:20,556 --> 01:13:22,057
They took Timmy.
They ran through the crowd,

1160
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:23,726
and they took all the children.

1161
01:13:23,809 --> 01:13:25,477
- They were giving them medicine.
- Well, that's good.

1162
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,229
The cops got Rick.

1163
01:13:27,312 --> 01:13:29,857
They shoved five guys in a van--
Took off.

1164
01:13:29,898 --> 01:13:31,859
- I just started running.
- You gotta get away from the street.

1165
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:33,444
Those medical people came by today.

1166
01:13:33,527 --> 01:13:36,238
They're not doctors.
They're fucking soldiers.

1167
01:13:37,031 --> 01:13:38,532
Lex!

1168
01:13:38,615 --> 01:13:41,702
Lexi, please go around back!

1169
01:13:41,744 --> 01:13:43,871
Lex, get around to the back of the house!

1170
01:13:43,912 --> 01:13:46,165
- What is this?
- Who cares what it is!

1171
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:48,709
- What does it mean?
- Who cares what it fucking means!

1172
01:13:48,751 --> 01:13:51,045
- You gotta go around back!
- It's gotta be bad.

1173
01:13:51,086 --> 01:13:52,921
Lexi, please!

1174
01:13:52,963 --> 01:13:55,591
- Would you please go around back?
- Okay.

1175
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:00,929
<i>Do not leave your homes.</i>

1176
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:04,391
What the fuck is this?

1177
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:06,060
Fuck!

1178
01:14:06,101 --> 01:14:07,394
Lexi!

1179
01:14:07,436 --> 01:14:09,772
There's fucking thousands of people
at the hospital.

1180
01:14:09,813 --> 01:14:11,023
They're pushing
and they're screaming,

1181
01:14:11,106 --> 01:14:12,524
and and they're climbing over each other.

1182
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:13,734
There's people jumping
from a parking garage

1183
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:15,778
across an alley way into a window.

1184
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,946
And cop cars are blocking the doors.

1185
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:20,074
I mean, what is that?

1186
01:14:20,115 --> 01:14:21,116
Fuck!

1187
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,910
Motherfuckers!

1188
01:14:22,993 --> 01:14:24,495
Oh, Brad.

1189
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,794
I mean, what is that?

1190
01:14:33,462 --> 01:14:34,797
That's not help.

1191
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,762
No one's coming here with medicine.

1192
01:15:03,992 --> 01:15:07,121
Maybe you should
go rest in the bedroom.

1193
01:15:07,204 --> 01:15:09,665
I'm good here.

1194
01:15:09,748 --> 01:15:12,584
The air feels good.

1195
01:15:31,311 --> 01:15:32,813
What is it?

1196
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:34,148
I don't know.

1197
01:15:35,691 --> 01:15:39,194
Baby, get in the back.
Go in the bedroom.

1198
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:30,829
Lex, where are you?

1199
01:16:30,913 --> 01:16:32,164
It's dead birds.

1200
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:35,542
There's dead birds everywhere.

1201
01:16:37,127 --> 01:16:38,504
Are you okay?

1202
01:16:38,587 --> 01:16:41,882
I'm okay!
I'm okay, it's just me.

1203
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:46,220
It's just me.

1204
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:52,309
<i>Lexi, it's me.</i>

1205
01:16:52,393 --> 01:16:54,687
<i>Listen, I'm gonna head downtown,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna come and get you.</i>

1206
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,689
<i>Just call me and tell me that you're okay.</i>

1207
01:16:56,772 --> 01:16:57,898
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>I'm leaving now.</i>

1208
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:00,317
<i>Lexi, it's Mom.</i>

1209
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:03,112
<i>I hope you're getting help.</i>

1210
01:17:03,195 --> 01:17:05,114
<i>Dad needs to speak with--</i>

1211
01:17:05,155 --> 01:17:06,782
<i>You know how he is.</i>

1212
01:17:06,865 --> 01:17:10,577
<i>Jason is up at the house, too.</i>
<i>We're worried sick.</i>

1213
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:11,995
<i>Please call us, sweetie.</i>

1214
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:15,541
<i>We love you, okay?</i>
<i>We love you.</i>

1215
01:17:15,624 --> 01:17:18,502
Lexi, it's me, Rich.

1216
01:17:18,585 --> 01:17:21,505
<i>No one was at the office,</i>
<i>and Gail said she couldn't reach you.</i>

1217
01:17:21,588 --> 01:17:23,090
<i>I'm headed your way.</i>

1218
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:25,009
Lex, it's Gail.

1219
01:17:25,092 --> 01:17:28,762
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>That's all.</i>

1220
01:17:29,805 --> 01:17:32,266
<i>I...</i>

1221
01:17:35,602 --> 01:17:37,896
<i>I pray that you're safe.</i>

1222
01:17:40,816 --> 01:17:42,860
<i>Lexi, it's Mom.</i>

1223
01:17:44,862 --> 01:17:45,946
<i>We love you.</i>

1224
01:17:45,988 --> 01:17:47,448
<i>I know that you know that.</i>

1225
01:17:47,489 --> 01:17:49,158
<i>We're praying for you, baby.</i>

1226
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:50,951
<i>Please call us.</i>

1227
01:17:50,993 --> 01:17:53,370
Lex, it's Jason.

1228
01:17:55,414 --> 01:17:57,958
<i>I talked to Mom, and--</i>

1229
01:17:59,752 --> 01:18:01,503
<i>if you get this--</i>

1230
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,882
<i>I don't know.</i>

1231
01:18:06,175 --> 01:18:07,760
<i>I love you.</i>

1232
01:18:07,843 --> 01:18:11,138
<i>If there's anything I can do,</i>
<i>if I can-- just call me.</i>

1233
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,057
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

1234
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,559
<i>Mom 's driving me fucking crazy.</i>

1235
01:18:15,642 --> 01:18:17,394
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

1236
01:18:17,478 --> 01:18:21,482
<i>All I know is I miss you.</i>

1237
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:23,942
<i>Call us.</i>

1238
01:18:24,026 --> 01:18:26,236
<i>Bye.</i>

1239
01:18:44,046 --> 01:18:45,964
<i>Lex! Are you okay?</i>
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

1240
01:18:46,048 --> 01:18:47,508
- It's bad.
<i>- I know. Mom said--</i>

1241
01:18:47,549 --> 01:18:49,385
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- It's really bad, Jas.

1242
01:18:49,426 --> 01:18:51,261
<i>Fucking Christ, Lexi!</i>

1243
01:18:51,345 --> 01:18:54,431
Listen, there's nothing
anyone can do, okay?

1244
01:18:54,515 --> 01:18:56,975
I just...

1245
01:18:57,059 --> 01:18:58,560
I just want to talk to you.

1246
01:18:58,644 --> 01:19:00,813
<i>What? Lexi, did you get help?</i>
<i>Did you go to the hospital?</i>

1247
01:19:00,896 --> 01:19:02,523
<i>They said on the news that there--</i>

1248
01:19:02,606 --> 01:19:05,317
Jason, I tried.
There's nothing I can do!

1249
01:19:05,401 --> 01:19:07,194
<i>Lexi--</i>

1250
01:19:07,236 --> 01:19:09,238
Please just talk to me, okay?

1251
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:14,243
I just want to hear your voice.
Just talk, okay?

1252
01:19:14,284 --> 01:19:16,995
Please?

1253
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:19,707
Jason?

1254
01:19:23,419 --> 01:19:25,045
<i>What do you want to talk about?</i>

1255
01:19:25,129 --> 01:19:27,006
I don't know.

1256
01:19:28,549 --> 01:19:29,842
Anything.

1257
01:19:31,093 --> 01:19:33,387
How are you?

1258
01:19:40,602 --> 01:19:42,438
It's okay.

1259
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:43,689
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1260
01:19:43,772 --> 01:19:46,608
It's okay if you can't.

1261
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:48,318
<i>I, um...</i>

1262
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:50,404
<i>I drove by the house</i>
<i>with Dad yesterday.</i>

1263
01:19:50,446 --> 01:19:52,656
- You did?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1264
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:55,409
How is he?

1265
01:19:55,492 --> 01:19:58,245
<i>He's... the same.</i>

1266
01:20:01,623 --> 01:20:03,792
<i>The house is brown now.</i>

1267
01:20:03,876 --> 01:20:05,878
- No! Really?
<i>- Yeah. Really ugly.</i>

1268
01:20:05,961 --> 01:20:07,588
- Weird.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1269
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:11,216
<i>Lexi, are you okay?</i>

1270
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,344
<i>Lexi?</i>

1271
01:20:14,845 --> 01:20:16,055
<i>Lexi, are you okay?</i>

1272
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:17,139
Listen...
I gonna go, okay?

1273
01:20:17,139 --> 01:20:21,560
Listen...
I gonna go, okay?

1274
01:20:21,643 --> 01:20:22,770
<i>What? Don't.</i>

1275
01:20:22,811 --> 01:20:24,772
- I'm tired.
<i>- Don't.</i>

1276
01:20:24,813 --> 01:20:27,441
- Jason--
<i>- Lexi, is there anything I can do?</i>

1277
01:20:27,483 --> 01:20:29,026
I'm gonna go be with Brad.

1278
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:30,361
I love you, Jason.

1279
01:20:30,444 --> 01:20:32,112
<i>No, don't hang up!</i>
<i>Don't--</i>

1280
01:21:04,728 --> 01:21:07,022
<i>The president is set to hold</i>
<i>a press conference tonight</i>

1281
01:21:07,106 --> 01:21:11,485
<i>where he will ask for assistance</i>
<i>from other allied nations</i>

1282
01:21:11,527 --> 01:21:14,571
<i>for professional and scientific relief.</i>

1283
01:21:14,655 --> 01:21:17,408
<i>In the meantime, National Guard reservists</i>

1284
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:19,785
<i>continue to be briefed at</i>
<i>Edwards Air Force Base</i>

1285
01:21:19,868 --> 01:21:21,787
<i>and then bused into the neighborhoods.</i>

1286
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:23,706
You know...

1287
01:21:23,789 --> 01:21:26,250
you did an amazing thing.

1288
01:21:26,333 --> 01:21:28,002
What?

1289
01:21:28,043 --> 01:21:29,628
You saved Timmy.

1290
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,133
Brad...

1291
01:21:36,385 --> 01:21:37,678
I'm sorry for...

1292
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,596
anything...

1293
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:40,639
Ugly.

1294
01:21:40,723 --> 01:21:44,101
No, I'm--
I don't know.

1295
01:21:44,184 --> 01:21:45,853
The fights seem--

1296
01:21:45,894 --> 01:21:48,939
Stupid fights seem stupider now.

1297
01:21:51,442 --> 01:21:53,402
They seemed stupid the other night.

1298
01:21:53,444 --> 01:21:57,239
Yeah. It's just...

1299
01:21:57,322 --> 01:22:00,159
I was...

1300
01:22:00,242 --> 01:22:05,164
working so much and keeping so busy
and thinking about the future.

1301
01:22:27,936 --> 01:22:29,772
We were...

1302
01:22:29,855 --> 01:22:30,898
When we were getting married,

1303
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:32,566
I had doubts about you and me.

1304
01:22:36,904 --> 01:22:39,156
Why are you telling me this?

1305
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:42,993
I don't know.

1306
01:22:45,913 --> 01:22:47,915
I never had any.

1307
01:22:53,796 --> 01:22:56,090
What else should we talk about?

1308
01:22:56,131 --> 01:22:59,259
Why don't we talk about
the children that we never had.

1309
01:23:02,304 --> 01:23:05,599
We would have screwed them up anyway.

1310
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:16,485
You know what's gonna happen, right?

1311
01:23:16,527 --> 01:23:17,778
We're gonna...

1312
01:23:19,988 --> 01:23:24,118
end up on one
of those daytime talk shows.

1313
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:31,250
Like a... a real sappy one,
you know?

1314
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,669
I mean, we'll take their calls, and...

1315
01:23:36,714 --> 01:23:40,551
I'll ramble on about how we managed...

1316
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:43,012
to survive and, you know,

1317
01:23:43,095 --> 01:23:46,557
all about how much
I love you, and how much...

1318
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,100
You mean to me.

1319
01:23:54,565 --> 01:23:58,360
You're the reason
I get out of bed every morning, and...

1320
01:23:58,402 --> 01:24:02,781
how you make...

1321
01:24:02,865 --> 01:24:05,409
my life complete.

1322
01:24:13,042 --> 01:24:16,003
We'll just-- We'll rip their hearts out.

1323
01:24:23,469 --> 01:24:26,305
We'll jam 'em right through
the phone lines.

1324
01:24:26,388 --> 01:24:29,600
You'll tell 'em how we met?

1325
01:24:29,683 --> 01:24:31,769
Your version or my version?

1326
01:24:31,852 --> 01:24:34,021
The only version.

1327
01:24:49,078 --> 01:24:51,497
I love you.

1328
01:24:53,415 --> 01:24:56,085
How much?

1329
01:24:56,168 --> 01:24:59,505
To Catalina and back.

1330
01:25:04,802 --> 01:25:06,512
Oh, fuck.

1331
01:25:08,931 --> 01:25:09,890
I'm sorry.

1332
01:25:09,932 --> 01:25:11,725
No.

1333
01:25:13,602 --> 01:25:15,771
It's not our fault.

1334
01:25:15,854 --> 01:25:18,399
You stay with me, okay?

1335
01:25:19,817 --> 01:25:21,443
I need you to stay.

1336
01:25:21,527 --> 01:25:25,698
Listen, baby,
you'll be okay.

1337
01:25:26,115 --> 01:25:28,409
It's okay.

1338
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:31,495
I'm okay.

1339
01:25:44,967 --> 01:25:46,885
Brad!

1340
01:25:46,969 --> 01:25:50,180
Brad!
Let me in! Brad!

1341
01:25:50,264 --> 01:25:52,266
Don't you touch her!
Don't fuckin' touch her!

1342
01:25:52,307 --> 01:25:53,434
Let go of her!

1343
01:25:53,475 --> 01:25:55,144
- Get the fuck off of her!
- Brad!

1344
01:25:55,227 --> 01:25:57,271
Open my fucking door!

1345
01:25:57,312 --> 01:26:00,107
Open my fucking door!

1346
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:01,525
Don't you fucking touch her!

1347
01:26:01,608 --> 01:26:02,818
We're here to help you!

1348
01:26:02,901 --> 01:26:04,987
Get your hands off of her!

1349
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:07,239
Let go of her!
Don't you fucking touch her!

1350
01:26:07,322 --> 01:26:10,951
Don't you fucking touch her!

1351
01:26:10,993 --> 01:26:11,994
You motherfuckers!

1352
01:26:12,077 --> 01:26:14,872
Get the man!

1353
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:15,998
Stay put!

1354
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:19,043
Don't fucking move!

1355
01:26:37,478 --> 01:26:38,896
Your wife is safe.

1356
01:26:38,979 --> 01:26:40,356
The best thing you could have done

1357
01:26:40,397 --> 01:26:42,024
was to keep her sealed right outside here.

1358
01:26:42,107 --> 01:26:43,317
What?

1359
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:46,320
The toxic level in your house
has reached an irreversible level.

1360
01:26:46,362 --> 01:26:49,823
Your airtight house has incubated
the ash into an airborne hybrid.

1361
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:51,658
You've created a breeding ground
for the poison.

1362
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,161
What are you saying?

1363
01:26:54,203 --> 01:26:56,455
The air in your house
is a deadly supply,

1364
01:26:56,538 --> 01:26:59,833
and you're a lethal carrier.

1365
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:02,294
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
nothing we can do.

1366
01:27:04,797 --> 01:27:07,841
Please don't struggle.

1367
01:27:11,553 --> 01:27:12,513
Wait a minute!

1368
01:27:12,554 --> 01:27:14,306
What'd you do with my wife?

1369
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:16,475
Hey!

1370
01:27:22,314 --> 01:27:24,358
Jesus Christ.

1371
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:26,026
Oh, fuck!

1372
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:27,236
Hey!

1373
01:27:33,575 --> 01:27:35,911
Hey!

1374
01:27:44,086 --> 01:27:45,796
Hey, stop!

1375
01:27:45,879 --> 01:27:47,965
Fuck!

1376
01:27:56,348 --> 01:27:57,850
Stop!

1377
01:27:57,933 --> 01:27:59,351
I'm still in here!

1378
01:28:44,313 --> 01:28:46,065
Stop!

1379
01:28:46,148 --> 01:28:47,608
Stop!

1380
01:29:52,548 --> 01:29:56,635
Stop it! I'm still alive!

1381
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,431
I can't breathe!
Please fucking stop!

1382
01:30:01,473 --> 01:30:02,516
Lexi!

1383
01:30:03,892 --> 01:30:05,144
I'm still alive!

1384
01:30:05,227 --> 01:30:07,438
Brad! Brad, get out!

1385
01:30:09,857 --> 01:30:11,358
- Help me!
- Let go!

1386
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,527
Somebody help him!

1387
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:16,196
No!

1388
01:30:17,364 --> 01:30:19,241
I'm still alive, you fucking assholes!

1389
01:30:20,868 --> 01:30:22,786
Come on, come on, come on!

1390
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:24,246
Somebody help him!

1391
01:30:27,416 --> 01:30:28,751
I'm still alive!

1392
01:30:28,792 --> 01:30:30,961
No! Brad!

1393
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:34,757
Help him!

1394
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,188
Pump the gas for another 20 minutes.

1395
01:30:49,271 --> 01:30:50,522
It'll suffocate the disease.

1396
01:31:38,946 --> 01:31:41,365
There's nothing we could have
done for your husband.

1397
01:31:41,448 --> 01:31:44,660
The virus has grown to an
uncontrollable proportion inside the house.

1398
01:31:44,743 --> 01:31:47,996
It's lethal.
The condition is irreversible.

1399
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,041
Say a prayer.
You might just make it.
