not true, actually, though,

in that hot band shirt
you love so much.

Can you just...
Can you please stop?

Well, hey,
maybe she's into you, too.

Maybe you should talk to her,
tell her how you feel.

I've tried talking to her.

140
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,607
Really?

141
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,875
Yes. Yeah, I...

142
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,377
I stayed afterwards,
um, last year

143
00:06:47,477 --> 00:06:49,211
after the spring
jazz band concert,

144
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:50,714
but, um, I didn't go up to her

145
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,716
because I was worried
that my hands were sweaty.

146
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,384
Which they weren't even,
they weren't even that sweaty.

147
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:55,985
I just... I was worried
that they were sweaty,

148
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,487
and sometimes
worrying that they're sweaty

149
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,188
makes them sweaty,
so I just went to the bathroom

150
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,757
and I put 'em under, like,
the hand dryer thing,

151
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:02,224
but then
they were still sweaty.

152
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:04,894
They were just, um...
They were just also warm.

153
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:08,030
I was kidding.

154
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,666
You obviously should not
talk to her.

155
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:11,267
You are a literal disaster.

So, what happened
to your arm exactly?

166
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:41,598
Um, I was climbing a tree,
and I fell.

167
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,032
It was stupid.

168
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:45,301
You fell out of a tree?
What are you, five?

169

Well, um...

170
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,739
So, actually,
I-I worked this summer

171
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,874
as an apprentice park ranger
at Ellison State Park.

173

It's a funny story,
though, because...

174
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,013
there was, like, this solid
ten minutes after I fell

175
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:59,616
where I just lay there
on the ground,

176
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:02,051
um, waiting for someone
to come get me, you know?

177
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,620
I was like, "Any second now."
You know?

178
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,154
I just kept... I, like...
I was saying to myself,

179
00:08:05,254 --> 00:08:06,889
"Any second now.
Here they come." So...

180
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,325
Did they?

181
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:09,359
No, nobody came.

182
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:12,396
That's the, um...
That's what's funny.

183

Well, anyways, um, how was...
Did you, um...

186
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:18,968
How was camp?

187
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:22,539
Well, I put on 13 pounds
of pure muscle.

188
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,375
Also, I hooked up
with this Brazilian dude

189
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:28,545
who is literally a supermodel.

190
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:31,515
So, yeah, hope that answers
your question.

191

318
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,719
- How was your day?
- Fine.

319
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:51,187
It was, it was pretty good.

320
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:54,057
Yeah? You know, I-I texted
with Meera this morning,

321
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:55,658
and she said that Jared was

322
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,961
really looking forward
to seeing you and reconnecting.

323
00:15:58,061 --> 00:15:59,429
I thought that was nice.

324
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,798
Yeah, he's so nice.

325
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,566
- HEIDI: How was Dr. Sherman?
- Pretty good.

326
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,668
Any change to your meds?

327
00:16:07,103 --> 00:16:08,538
EVAN:
Um, no.

328
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,974
Oh, God, here he comes.
Um, all right, I-I-I...

329
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,343
All right, love you. Bye.

330
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:14,844

331
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:16,446
too.

JARED: <i>A letter to yourself.
I mean, what is that,</i>

333
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:22,619
like some kind of sex thing?

334
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:24,254
No. No, it's not a sex thing.

335
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,989
It's... It was an assignment
from my therapist.

336
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,891
Ew. Why-why are you
telling me this?

337
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:29,392
Well, I didn't know
who else to tell.

338

You're my only f...
family friend.

Oh, that's sad.

Look, Connor isn't here
again today.

341
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:36,333
That's-that's
three days in a row.

342
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,434
And h-he hasn't done anything
with it yet, you know,

343
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:39,669
like put it online or whatever,

344
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,271
because I've-I've been checking.

345
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:44,107
So, you know, maybe he just...
maybe he forgot, right?

346
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,009
Right. Right.

347
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,243
Or maybe he didn't,

348
00:16:47,344 --> 00:16:48,912
because he's definitely
gonna put it online.

349
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:50,980
Dude, Connor Murphy is batshit.

350
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,082
Don't you remember when
he threw a printer at Mrs. G

351
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:55,718
in the second grade because
he couldn't be line leader?

352
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,453
Like, he was seven.

353
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,622
Just imagine
what he's capable of now.

354

Hi.

361
00:17:46,936 --> 00:17:48,037
Hello.

362
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,574
Why don't you go ahead, honey.

363
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:53,509
I'm going as fast as I can.

364
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:56,779
Well, that's not
what I said, is it?

365
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,150
This is...

366
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:06,122
Connor wanted you to have this.

367
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:21,637
LARRY: Yeah, we didn't know
you were friends.

368
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:23,072
Oh, well, we didn't think

369
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:25,975
Connor had any friends,
frankly, and...

370
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:28,778
and then we see this note,
and it seems to suggest

371
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:31,348
pretty clearly that
you and Connor were, uh...

372
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:33,950
Or at least for Connor...

373
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,052
"Dear Evan Hansen."
He addressed it to you.

374
00:18:36,152 --> 00:18:38,054
He wrote it to you.

375
00:18:38,154 --> 00:18:41,057
These are the words that
he wanted to share with you.

376
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,796
His last words.

377
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:51,167
Connor took his own life.

in his pocket.

But this is...

382

I'm sorry, Connor didn't...
He... (sighs)

00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,028
S... Uh, Connor and I...

478
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,865
(chuckles):
Uh, I d... I don't know, um...

479
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:53,269
We had a really great...

480
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,506
we had a really great time
together, um...

481
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:58,207
this one day recently.

482
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:02,446
That's something good,
um, that I remember.

483
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:03,846
That day.

484
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:05,615
Um...

485
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:08,117
Yeah, that awesome day at the...

486
00:24:08,884 --> 00:24:10,953
...um, trees.

487
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:14,691
- Trees?
- Never mind, never mind.

488
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,561
I'm sorry, I don't, I don't...
I shouldn't have said anything,

489
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,363
and I-I knew it was stupid,
so I'm sorry...

490
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:21,063
You don't mean the orchard,
do you?

491
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:26,603
- He took you to the apple orchard?
- (chuckles softly)

492
00:24:26,703 --> 00:24:28,672
- When?
- Uh, once.

493
00:24:28,772 --> 00:24:30,005
Just-just once. That once.

494
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:32,509
I thought that place closed
years ago.

495
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,544
Well, the hiking trails are
still open though, aren't they?

496
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:37,213
We used to go to the orchard
all of the time.

497
00:24:37,314 --> 00:24:39,081
We'd do picnics there.

498
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:40,916
Do you remember that, Zoe?

499
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,452
Yeah, I do.

500
00:24:42,552 --> 00:24:45,087
And you and Connor would fly
that little toy plane

501
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:47,424
(laughs): until you crashed it
into the creek.

502
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:50,327
That was an emergency landing.

503
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:53,497
I can't believe
that he took you there.

504
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:55,297
I bet you had fun.

505
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:58,535
I bet the two of you... I...

506
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:00,570
I bet that was fun.

507
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:03,807
Yeah.

508
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:05,709
We did. We did.

I got nervous

I just...

Uh, his mom thinks that
we wrote emails to each other.

Oh, perfect.

602
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,109
Sh-She thinks he had,
like, secret accounts.

603
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,877
Ha, yes. Secret email accounts.

604

- No, thank you.
- What was that?

608
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:51,054
I said thank you
for the encouragement!

609
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:52,155
Fascist.

610
00:30:52,254 --> 00:30:53,857
She wants to see the emails.

611
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:56,326
And now you want me to make
a bunch of fake emails for you.

612
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:57,827
- Classic.
- You know how to do that?

613
00:30:57,927 --> 00:31:00,330
- It's simple coding.
- But you failed coding.

614

If you consider
a D-minus failing.

not a ceiling.

- 500.

All of a sudden,
people I've never met

725
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:15,818
want to be my best friend.

726

I'm the dead kid's sister,
didn't you know?

727
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:20,690
I'm sure they mean well.

728
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,026
I'm sure they don't.

Oh.

738
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:53,089
You don't have to stop playing.

739
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,992
How was band?

740
00:35:58,495 --> 00:36:01,498
You know, he-he talks about
you playing guitar,

741
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:05,402
in one of his emails, at
the spring concert last year.

742
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:07,270
Really?

743
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:08,304
(softly):
Yeah.

744
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:11,974
Does he, does he talk about

745
00:36:12,075 --> 00:36:14,243
when he disappeared
for two days?

746
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:17,314
But then he called me and
asked me to come pick him up.

747
00:36:17,414 --> 00:36:18,681
He wanted to come home,

748
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,216
but he wasn't ready
to talk to you yet,

749
00:36:20,317 --> 00:36:23,454
so I took the bus all the way
downtown to get him,

750
00:36:23,554 --> 00:36:26,155
and guess what.

751
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:31,828
All he really wanted was money.

752
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:38,734
And I gave it to him
because I was 12.

753
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,272
He was struggling.

754
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,810
How about the time he tried
to punch through my door,

755
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,313
screaming at
the top of his lungs,

756
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:52,416
saying he was gonna kill me
for no reason?

757
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:54,784
Is that email in there?

758

about them on NPR yesterday,</i>

825
00:41:47,878 --> 00:41:49,111
these-these essay contests.

826
00:41:49,211 --> 00:41:50,514
And if you win,

827
00:41:50,614 --> 00:41:52,114
it doesn't count against
any financial aid.

828
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:57,052
You know, so $5,000 here
or $3,000 there.

829
00:41:57,153 --> 00:41:59,255
It adds up, and we're gonna need

830
00:41:59,356 --> 00:42:01,491
all the help we can get
with college.

831
00:42:01,591 --> 00:42:04,861
I mean, unless your stepmother
has some trust fund for you

832
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,296
that I don't know about
with all those fabulous tips

833
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:08,865
- she made cocktail waitressing.
- Huh.

834
00:42:08,964 --> 00:42:10,867
- Right? (chuckles)
- (chuckles)

835
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:12,469
Mm.

838
00:42:17,507 --> 00:42:18,708
I got a...

839
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:21,578
I got an email
from your school yesterday,

840
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:25,682
um, about that boy
that-that killed himself.

841
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:26,949
Connor Murphy?

842
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,718
Yeah.

843
00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:30,353
I didn't really know him, so...

844
00:42:30,454 --> 00:42:35,090
You know, if you ever
want to talk about anything...

845
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:37,092
You know, I mean, I mean,
I know that lately

846
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:38,495
it feels like
I'm-I'm always working.

847
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:40,363
- It's fine.
- But I'm-I'm-I'm here,

848
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:42,998
and if I... If I'm not here,
I'm just a phone call away

849
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,734
or an email or a text,
you know, whatever.

850
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:46,302
I know.

851
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:49,940
It says "Connor" on your cast.

852
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,107
Oh.

853
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:53,610
No, no, yeah. Um...

854
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,978
- You said you didn't know him.
- Sorry, I didn't.

855
00:42:56,078 --> 00:42:57,781
Um...

856
00:42:57,881 --> 00:43:00,550
It's in memory, so, like...

857
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,853
Y-You know,
kids are, like, um...

858
00:43:02,953 --> 00:43:04,688
they're writing
his name on-on...

859
00:43:04,788 --> 00:43:07,657
lockers and stuff like that.

860
00:43:07,757 --> 00:43:09,225
(sighs):
Oh.

861
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:13,028
Um...

862
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:18,267
That's lovely.
You know, in memory.

863
00:43:18,368 --> 00:43:19,769
(softly):
Hmm.

864
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:23,305
Hey.

865
00:43:23,406 --> 00:43:25,274
Tuesday. What are you doing?

866
00:43:26,376 --> 00:43:28,945
When's the last time
we did Taco Tuesday?

867
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:30,680
That'd be great.

868
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,716
Really?

869
00:43:32,816 --> 00:43:34,216
(chuckles):
Yeah.

870
00:43:34,317 --> 00:43:36,218
ALANA: So the memorial's
really just an opportunity

871
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,120
for all of us to come together
as a community

872
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:41,625
and to remember Connor
and celebrate who he was.

873
00:43:42,592 --> 00:43:44,059
Would you want to speak
or perform?

874
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:45,962
I didn't really know him.
I'm sorry.

875
00:43:46,061 --> 00:43:48,197
- That's okay.
- Bye.

876
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,578
Want a wristband?

877
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:03,980
Oh, yes. Yeah. Okay.

878
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,448
Thank you.

879
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,085
You were friends
with him, right?

880
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:13,323
I saw him sign your cast
in the library,

881
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:15,992
and you started arguing
about something.

882
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,563
- Were you friends with him?
- We weren't close.

883
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:22,365
We presented together o-on
Huck Finn in the tenth grade,

884
00:44:22,465 --> 00:44:25,301
but he probably didn't
tell you that. (chuckles)

885
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:27,169
Um, no, no, I didn't know.

886
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:29,339
I always really liked him.

887
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,041
It seemed like
he didn't really care

888
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,009
what anyone else thought, and...

889
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:34,911
(chuckles): I thought
that was pretty remarkable.

890
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,846
(chuckles)

891
00:44:38,715 --> 00:44:41,116
Well, I'm putting together
a memorial for him

892
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:43,285
at school on Friday.

893
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:44,821
If you wanted to do something...

894
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:47,256
Oh. Um...

895
00:44:47,357 --> 00:44:49,459
Sorry, I-I...

896
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,128
I-I probably w-would
rather not, if that's okay.

897
00:44:53,228 --> 00:44:54,263
Yeah, sure.

898
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:56,800
If you change your mind...

899
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,068
just text me.

900
00:44:58,167 --> 00:44:59,569

My mom realized
we were out of ice cream,

907
00:45:52,555 --> 00:45:54,624
so they went to go get more.

908
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:57,327
Did you park in the driveway?

909
00:45:57,427 --> 00:45:59,763
'Cause if you park on the
street, they'll ticket you.

910
00:45:59,863 --> 00:46:01,731
The people in this neighborhood

Um, no, I didn't,
I didn't, um...

912
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:06,069
I took the bus.
My mom needed the car for work.

913
00:46:06,168 --> 00:46:08,138
- What about your dad?
- My dad.

914
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:10,840
Um, he lives in Colorado, so...

915
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,175
He left when I was seven.

916
00:46:14,077 --> 00:46:15,612
(sighs)

917
00:46:15,712 --> 00:46:17,279
That sucks.

918
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,785
Mine died when I was one, so...

919
00:46:21,885 --> 00:46:23,086
I sort of win.

920
00:46:23,185 --> 00:46:24,087
(chuckles softly)

921
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:26,122
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

922
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:27,657
It's fine.

923
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:30,894
I-I don't even really
remember him, to be honest.

924
00:46:30,994 --> 00:46:33,797
Connor did, though, a little.

925
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:35,765
That's terrible.

926
00:46:35,865 --> 00:46:37,199
(sighs) Yeah.

927
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:41,203
And then Larry showed up,
fixed everything.

928
00:46:42,372 --> 00:46:44,541
For a while, at least.

929
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,009
Yeah.

930
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:48,745
Most people, with Connor,
they just would've been like,

931
00:46:48,845 --> 00:46:53,583
"See ya," but he's the only dad
we ever really knew, so...

932
00:46:54,918 --> 00:46:57,087
Wow, your mom...
I didn't, I didn't realize.

933
00:46:57,187 --> 00:46:58,555
Yeah, well.

934
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:01,057
She's in total denial now.

935
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:02,459
So is Larry.

936
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:04,094
I mean, he didn't even cry
at the funeral.

937
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:05,462
I'm sorry.

938
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,998
(singsongy): Not as sorry
as you're gonna be.

939
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:12,702
- Oh, is-is that the...
- Mm-hmm.

940
00:47:12,802 --> 00:47:16,206
Gluten-free apple pie? You bet.

941
00:47:16,305 --> 00:47:17,874
It-it looks...

942
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:21,177
- Inedible?
- (chuckles)

943
00:47:21,276 --> 00:47:22,846
It is.

944
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:26,616
Just be glad we get to have
real ice cream.

945
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:28,618
My mom was Buddhist last year,

946
00:47:28,718 --> 00:47:30,420
so we couldn't have
any animal products.

947
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,889
She was B... um, Buddhist
last year but not this year?

948
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:35,358
Yep.
That's sort of what she does.

949
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,227
She gets into
a lot of different things.

950
00:47:37,327 --> 00:47:40,430
- Mm.
- For a while, it was Pilates.

00:47:42,398 --> 00:47:44,200
Buddhism. Et cetera.

953
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:46,536
It's cool that she's interested
in so much different stuff.

954
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:47,871
Yeah, she's not, though.

955
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:50,073
That's just what happens
when you're rich

956
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:51,141
and you don't have a job.

957
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:52,342
You get a little crazy.

958
00:47:52,442 --> 00:47:53,610
(chuckles)
Well, my mom always says

959
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,211
it's better to be rich
than poor, so...

960
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:56,880
Yeah, well, your mom's
probably never been rich, then.

961
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,848
Yeah, you've probably
never been poor.

962
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,318
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I just said that.

963
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:03,653
I'm so sorry.

964
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:05,722
(laughing):
Wow. I didn't realize

965
00:48:05,822 --> 00:48:08,224
you were capable of saying
something that wasn't nice.

966
00:48:08,324 --> 00:48:09,859
I'm n... I'm not.
I'm really sorry.

967
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:12,428
You really don't
have to keep saying that.

968
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:14,430
(softly):
Okay.

969
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,599
You want to say it again.

970
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,134
Yeah, very much so, I do.

971
00:48:18,234 --> 00:48:19,803
(laughs)

972
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:27,710
Why did he write that...

973
00:48:27,811 --> 00:48:29,012
in his note?

974
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:31,047
"Because there's Zoe.

975
00:48:31,147 --> 00:48:34,818
And I don't even know her, but
if I could just talk to her..."

976
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,422
Honestly, I really don't know.

977
00:48:39,522 --> 00:48:42,125
What does any of that
even mean? I mean...

978
00:48:42,225 --> 00:48:44,360
We weren't close at all.

979
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,729
Not since we were kids.

980
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:48,832
He never noticed anything
about me.

981
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:51,434
That's not true.
That's not true.

982
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:53,803
He-he-he noticed
a lot of things about you.

983
00:48:53,903 --> 00:48:55,605
Like what things?

984
00:49:02,178 --> 00:49:03,746
(sighs)

985
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:06,783
Right.

986
00:49:06,883 --> 00:49:07,784
No, no, no.

987
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:09,886
That's, um...

988
00:49:09,986 --> 00:49:11,054
Well...

989
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:12,956
Okay, w... Okay.

990
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:15,091
Here's something. Um...

991
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:18,828
Whenever you have, uh,
a solo in-in jazz band,

992
00:49:18,928 --> 00:49:21,030
you just... (sighs)
you close your e...

993
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,599
you probably don't even know
you're doing this,

994
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:25,101
but you close your eyes,
um, and you get, like...

995
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:26,870
I don't know,
it's like a half smile,

996
00:49:26,970 --> 00:49:28,671
like you just heard the
funniest thing in the world,

997
00:49:28,771 --> 00:49:30,206
but it's a secret and
you can't tell anyone about it.

998
00:49:30,306 --> 00:49:31,841
But then...

999
00:49:31,941 --> 00:49:33,843
uh, the way that you smile,
it's sort of like you are...

1000
00:49:33,943 --> 00:49:36,679
you're letting us in

and they picked out a suit,

(voice cracking): ...my
best friend, Connor Murphy.

1265
01:05:29,365 --> 01:05:30,466
Holy shit.

1266
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:32,001
(Evan breathes deeply)

1267
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:33,970
I would like to tell you
about the day that Connor and I

1268
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:37,574
went hiking behind the old
Autumn Smile Apple Orchard.

1269
01:05:37,674 --> 01:05:40,109
We found a huge oak tree.

1270
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,245
Connor said that he wondered
what the world would look like

1271
01:05:42,345 --> 01:05:46,583
from all the way up there,
so we decided to find out.

1272
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,452
(breathes deeply)

1273
01:05:49,552 --> 01:05:51,754
We started climbing slowly.
(sniffles)

1274
01:05:51,855 --> 01:05:53,723
And then,
when I finally looked back,

1275
01:05:53,823 --> 01:05:55,658
we were already
30 feet off the ground.

1276
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:57,994
Um, Connor just looked at me...

1277
01:05:59,662 --> 01:06:02,165
...and smiled
that way he always did.

1278
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:04,567
Um, and then...

1279
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:13,409
(Evan breathes deeply)

1280
01:06:13,509 --> 01:06:15,078
Um...

1281
01:06:16,179 --> 01:06:17,513
Sorry. Then I fell.

1282
01:06:17,614 --> 01:06:19,682
I-I lay there

1457
01:15:57,193 --> 01:15:59,496
baseball fans,
uh, you could raise

1458

at least a few hundred bucks
for the orchard,

1459

maybe a couple thousand.

1460

Yeah, but...

1461
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:08,805
I mean, you should, you should
probably keep all this stuff.

Oh, uh, it's just gonna
sit here gathering dust.

Uh, stiff as a board, isn't it?

Yeah.

Connor...

Cynthia wasn't sure how the
kids would react, all right?

She was terrified.

1472
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:35,799
And I was terrified.

1473
01:16:35,899 --> 01:16:37,801
I mean...

1474
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:39,636

climbed a tree together

at an orchard.

you didn't answer your phone.

Yeah, that would've been great.

What's this?

1547

Oh, it's just my mom is obsessed

1548
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:48,818
with these college scholarship
essay contests.

1549
01:20:48,918 --> 01:20:51,187
I mean, I'd-I'd-I'd have to win
probably, like, all of them

1550
01:20:51,286 --> 01:20:55,290
to actually pay
for college, so...

1551
01:20:56,626 --> 01:20:58,828
Your parents,
they-they can't...?

1552
01:20:58,928 --> 01:21:00,897
Uh, not really.

1553
01:21:02,297 --> 01:21:03,700
I'm sorry.

1554
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,677
Is your room upstairs?

1555
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:20,917
Yeah. It's, um...

1556
01:21:23,386 --> 01:21:24,788
(sighs) Yeah.

1557
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:34,864
Yeah, so it's, like, a pretty
standard sort of room, I guess.

1558
01:21:34,964 --> 01:21:36,199
So...

1559
01:21:36,298 --> 01:21:37,934
Hey. Oh, um...

1560
01:21:38,034 --> 01:21:39,803
actually, I meant
to tell you this before.

1561
01:21:39,903 --> 01:21:42,705
Um, so Alana and I
had a really good...

1562
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,509
Um, we had a really good
meeting this morning,

1563
01:21:46,609 --> 01:21:48,611
and I think that...
y-you probably noticed,

1564
01:21:48,711 --> 01:21:51,281
um, that, uh, you know,
a lot of people were giving,

1565
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:54,083
uh, during that first week,
which is definitely great,

1566
01:21:54,184 --> 01:21:56,653
but, um, it sort of slowed down
a bit, obviously.

1567
01:21:56,753 --> 01:21:57,954
But Alana and I
are really confident

1568
01:21:58,054 --> 01:21:59,489
that it's gonna
pick right back up.

1569
01:21:59,589 --> 01:22:01,991
I think it's just a m...
a matter of...

1570
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,461
Can I talk to you
about something?

1571
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,533
Yes.

1572
01:22:14,604 --> 01:22:16,372
(sighs) Uh...

1573
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:18,775
The Connor Project is...
awesome.

1574
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:21,878
It's-it's really, really cool.

1575
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:23,179
Oh.

1576
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:26,583
- Thank you.
- It's just that, my whole life,

1577
01:22:26,683 --> 01:22:28,284
everything has been about him.

1578
01:22:28,384 --> 01:22:31,988
And maybe the two of us...

1579
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,959
...maybe we don't have to talk
about my brother all the time.

1580
01:22:36,059 --> 01:22:38,228

No.

1651
01:27:20,843 --> 01:27:22,044
I'm famous for doing that.

1652
01:27:22,145 --> 01:27:23,347
CYNTHIA:
I've been told that many times.

01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,348
HEIDI:
Mm-hmm.

1654
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:25,349
Hi, honey.

1655
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:26,716
CYNTHIA:
Come join us.

1656
01:27:26,816 --> 01:27:29,218
- I just put dinner in the oven.
- Hi.

1657
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:31,254
(laughs)

1658
01:27:31,355 --> 01:27:32,788
She made me swear
to keep it a surprise.

1659
01:27:32,889 --> 01:27:34,290
- I'm surprised.
- (laughs)

1660
01:27:34,391 --> 01:27:35,526
Hi.

1661
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:37,226
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

1662
01:27:37,327 --> 01:27:38,694
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

1663
01:27:38,794 --> 01:27:40,430
Yeah, uh, great.

1664
01:27:40,531 --> 01:27:42,432
- It's great.
- (chuckles)

1665
01:27:42,533 --> 01:27:44,167
Come on, Evan. Sit.

1666
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:47,904
I-I thought that you were
working tonight.

1667
01:27:48,004 --> 01:27:50,072
HEIDI: Cynthia called
and invited me for dinner,

1668
01:27:50,173 --> 01:27:51,974
so, you know, I'm playing hooky.

1669
01:27:52,074 --> 01:27:54,177
We were just discussing
how sneaky you and Connor were.

1670
01:27:54,277 --> 01:27:56,879
HEIDI: I had no idea that he
and Connor were even friends.

1671
01:27:56,979 --> 01:27:58,281
LARRY:
Oh, we were the same.

1672
01:27:58,382 --> 01:27:59,916
CYNTHIA: You know,
boys love their secrets.

1673
01:28:00,016 --> 01:28:01,918
Something smells good.
What's for dinner?

1674
01:28:02,018 --> 01:28:03,786
Oh, it's chicken Milanese,
your favorite.

1675
01:28:03,886 --> 01:28:05,755
Oh, actually his favorite is

1676
01:28:05,855 --> 01:28:07,256
my great-grandmother's
black beans.

1677
01:28:07,357 --> 01:28:08,224
Really?

1678
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,692
CYNTHIA:
Well, he's the only one

1679
01:28:09,792 --> 01:28:10,927
that appreciates
my cooking, so...

1680
01:28:11,027 --> 01:28:12,563
- That's not true.
- Uh, another drop?

1681
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,665
Oh, no, no. I'm-I'm fine.
Thank you.

1682
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:17,033
Oh, um, fascinating story
about the wine.

1683
01:28:17,133 --> 01:28:19,603
It's from a vineyard in Napa,

1684
01:28:19,735 --> 01:28:22,872
and the entire growing process
from start to finish,

1685
01:28:22,972 --> 01:28:24,807
100% sustainable.

1686
01:28:24,907 --> 01:28:26,175
Is that right?

1687
01:28:26,275 --> 01:28:28,744
Not to mention,
it tastes good, too.

1688
01:28:28,844 --> 01:28:29,946
- Mm-hmm. It does.
- Mm.

1689
01:28:30,046 --> 01:28:32,248
You know,
I-I didn't realize, uh...

1690
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:33,749
Cynthia and Larry
were telling me

1691
01:28:33,849 --> 01:28:35,284
that you spend
so much time here.

1692
01:28:35,385 --> 01:28:37,119
Yeah, I... you've been
working a lot, so...

1693
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,356
Why did I think
you were at Jared's?

1694
01:28:39,456 --> 01:28:40,756
I-I don't know.

1695
01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:42,124
ZOE:
Evan was showing me

1696
01:28:42,225 --> 01:28:45,529
all of those scholarship
contests that you found.

1697
01:28:45,629 --> 01:28:46,663
It's really impressive.

1698
01:28:46,762 --> 01:28:49,499
Well, Evan is a great writer.

1699
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,000
CYNTHIA:
Well, that does not

1700
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:52,636
surprise me at all.

1701
01:28:53,437 --> 01:28:55,938
His English teacher last year
told me that he wrote

1702
01:28:56,038 --> 01:28:58,508
one of the best papers
she'd ever read on <i>Sulu.</i>

1703
01:28:58,609 --> 01:28:59,576
Is that right?

1704
01:28:59,676 --> 01:29:01,877
- It's <i>Sula.</i>
- What?

1705
01:29:01,978 --> 01:29:03,279
You said "Sulu." It's <i>Sula.</i>

1706
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:05,549
LARRY:
Yeah, I believe Sulu's

1707
01:29:05,649 --> 01:29:07,484
a character on <i>Star Trek.</i>

1708
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,885
(laughter)

1709
01:29:10,987 --> 01:29:12,489
My mistake.

1710
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:17,427
So, speaking of scholarships...

1711
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,496
Oh, right, uh...

1712
01:29:19,596 --> 01:29:21,931
Yeah, well, I guess...
(clears throat)

1713
01:29:22,031 --> 01:29:25,435
now's as good a time as any.

1714
01:29:25,535 --> 01:29:27,604
Uh...

1715
01:29:27,704 --> 01:29:30,072
Cynthia, do you want to...?

1716
01:29:30,172 --> 01:29:30,873
Hmm.

1717
01:29:30,973 --> 01:29:32,743
Well, um...

1718
01:29:32,842 --> 01:29:36,446
Zoe happened to mention that
Evan was having some difficulty

1719
01:29:36,546 --> 01:29:40,283
in terms of the
financial burden of college.

1720
01:29:40,384 --> 01:29:43,819
And Larry and I
started thinking,

1721
01:29:43,919 --> 01:29:45,489
and we've been fortunate enough

1722
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:48,157
to set some money aside
for Connor.

1723
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:53,095
Um, I'm good.

1724
01:29:53,195 --> 01:29:54,731
- I'm okay.
- Yeah.

1725
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,300
Heidi, with your blessing,
we would like to give Evan

1726
01:29:57,401 --> 01:29:59,101
the money that we set aside
for our son

1727
01:29:59,201 --> 01:30:03,340
so he can fulfill his dreams.

1728
01:30:08,878 --> 01:30:11,415
Thank you so much...

1729
01:30:11,515 --> 01:30:13,015
but we're gonna be fine.

1730
01:30:13,115 --> 01:30:15,552
I don't have a lot of money,
but I-I do have some.

1731
01:30:15,652 --> 01:30:17,053
Oh.

1732
01:30:17,153 --> 01:30:18,622
No, no, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to intimate...

1733
01:30:18,722 --> 01:30:21,223
No, no, I understand,
but, um, we do have money,

1734
01:30:21,325 --> 01:30:24,894
so I'm sorry you were under

1735
01:30:24,994 --> 01:30:27,096
And whatever money
we don't have,

1736
01:30:27,196 --> 01:30:30,099
Evan will either
make up for with a job

1737
01:30:30,199 --> 01:30:31,635
or he'll get a scholarship.

1738
01:30:31,735 --> 01:30:34,771
I don't want my son
to get the idea that it's okay

1739
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,205
to rely on other people
for favors.

1740
01:30:36,305 --> 01:30:38,140
- Well, it's not a favor.
- No.

1741
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,377
But as his mother,
I need to set that example.

1742
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,612
You can't expect things
from strangers.

1743
01:30:42,713 --> 01:30:44,581
Oh, we're not strangers.

1744
01:30:44,681 --> 01:30:47,083
No, of course not.

1745
01:30:47,883 --> 01:30:49,985
But you're not family either.

1746
01:30:57,461 --> 01:30:58,861
Mom, just hold on.

1747
01:30:58,961 --> 01:31:00,530
No, I think
I better get to work,

1748
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,366
see if I can grab a shift
now that I know

1749
01:31:02,466 --> 01:31:04,401
how concerned you are
about our finances.

1750
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,935
Mom, will you please
come back inside?

1751
01:31:06,035 --> 01:31:07,970
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

1752
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:10,172
Will you just
come back inside, please?

1753

They think you're their son,
these people.

1754
01:31:13,242 --> 01:31:14,243
They're not "these people."

1755
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:15,812
They don't really know you.

1756
01:31:15,911 --> 01:31:17,647
Well, they like me.
They like me.

1757
01:31:17,748 --> 01:31:19,549
I know that that's very hard
for you to believe,

1758
01:31:19,649 --> 01:31:20,950
that they don't think I'm...

1759
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:22,319
you know, that there's
something wrong with me,

1760
01:31:22,419 --> 01:31:23,886
that I need to be,
like, fixed, like you do.

1761
01:31:23,986 --> 01:31:25,622
- When have I ever said that?
- Oh, my God.

1762
01:31:25,722 --> 01:31:27,089
Mom, I-I have to go
to therapy, right?

1763
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:28,392
I have to take drugs.
I have to...

1764
01:31:28,492 --> 01:31:30,126
There's-there's nothing
wrong with that.

1765
01:31:30,226 --> 01:31:31,361
There-There's nothing wrong
with needing help, honey.

1766
01:31:31,461 --> 01:31:32,629
Just stop.
I know that there is,

1767
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:34,096
and I know that I'm a burden,

1768
01:31:34,196 --> 01:31:35,499
that I'm the worst thing
that ever happened to you,

1769
01:31:35,599 --> 01:31:36,733
and I just... well, I just
ruined your life, okay?!

1770
01:31:36,833 --> 01:31:39,569
No. You are the best thing.

1771
01:31:39,669 --> 01:31:42,238
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

1772
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,609
I'm sorry I can't give you
anything more than that.

1773
01:31:46,976 --> 01:31:49,278
It's not my fault
if other people can.

1774
01:31:56,353 --> 01:31:57,487

Hi.

I'm so sorry.
I meant to be there yesterday.

1780
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:15,639
Okay, well, we have two days
left, and we're $25,000 short.

You're right. I know. I'm sorry.

1783

Things have been
really busy, so...

1784
01:32:23,179 --> 01:32:24,748
I've been wondering something.

1785
01:32:24,848 --> 01:32:26,650
Mm-hmm?

1786
01:32:27,451 --> 01:32:29,453
Were you ever actually
friends with him?

1787
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:32,522
What are you talking about?

1788
01:32:32,622 --> 01:32:35,224
Well, the thing about
the emails, it's just that,

keep talking about

climbing this tree together
in June.

1791
01:32:39,061 --> 01:32:40,029
Mm-hmm?

1792
01:32:40,129 --> 01:32:42,499
We were in school in June.

1793
01:32:43,299 --> 01:32:45,635
You didn't have a cast
until September.

1794
01:32:45,735 --> 01:32:47,303
Well, uh, you know what?

1795
01:32:47,404 --> 01:32:49,171
We probably just wrote down
the wrong date or something.

1796
01:32:49,271 --> 01:32:52,609
It's not just the emails, Evan.

1797
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:55,177
You've missed, like,
three meetings in a row.

1798
01:32:55,277 --> 01:32:57,112
If I were his best friend,

1799

I would be doing
everything I could to make sure
