2
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,640
Her mother is dead.

3
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,931
You are her aunt.
I don't know what to do with her.

4
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,067
I'll send more each month.

5
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,835
Before you can even start to miss me...

6
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:45,382
...I'm going to sail right up that river,
take you back to Africa.

7
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,283
Girls in Africa may not wear shoes...

8
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,537
...but French girls do.

9
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,458
Quietly, Therese.

10
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,958
Your father isn't coming back, Therese.

11
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,294
He'll come back.

12
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:09,588
My brother has never done a single thing
he said he was going to do.

13
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,307
Therese, your cousin
needs his medicine.

14
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,688
<i>God gives and he takes away.</i>

15
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,826
He took away Camille's health,
but gave him you.

16
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,986
You're his guardian angel.

17
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,224
- Should you be out?
- I escaped.

18
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,947
Kiss me, Camille.

19
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,071
All right.

20
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,819
No, not like that.

21
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,454
Like this?

22
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,823
No.

23
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,255
Well, how?

24
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,460
Never mind.

25
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:02,803
A letter came for you from Africa.

26
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,184
Your father went down
off the coast of Algeria.

27
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,901
What's going to happen to me now?

28
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:26,698
Well, there's the small pension
your father left you.

29
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,207
Perhaps...

30
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,711
Perhaps we could use that
to help find our way.

31
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,090
Oh, my son. Oh, my God.

32
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,926
What was I thinking?
You should be inside, it's damp out here.

33
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,389
I'm fine. You're overreacting.

34
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,864
Camille has an announcement
to make.

35
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:12,459
- We're moving to Paris.
- Paris?

36
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:15,291
- Such a filthy city.
- Yes.

37
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:19,299
Through an old friend of mother's,
Inspector Michaud, I have found a job.

38
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,586
In an office. A lowly clerk
in a big company...

39
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,754
...being with my own little desk.

40
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,925
- It sounds wonderful.
- Makes no sense to me whatsoever.

41
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,345
How are we supposed
to look after you if you're gone all day?

42
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,061
The doctor did say I should exert myself
more and you do spoil me.

43
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,773
He's a country doctor with one dead eye.
I hardly believe he knows...

44
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,812
I've let you coddle me all my life.

45
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,607
The least you can do
is allow me a will of my own.

46
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,447
It's time I take control
of our little family.

47
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,116
Well...

48
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,751
I've often dreamed
of having a small shop again.

49
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,126
See? A silver lining.

50
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,711
You know, a few special lace pieces
in the window and...

51
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,797
You let me take care
of everything, you naughty boy.

52
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,678
I wouldn't dream of having it
any other way, Mother.

53
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,805
We can leave right after the wedding.

54
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,637
Whose wedding are we going to?

55
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,137
Well, yours, dear.

56
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,809
Well, but who am I going to marry?

57
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,318
Why, Camille, of course.

58
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:35,834
Therese, we don't even know
who your mother was.

59
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,081
Illegitimates have been dealt
an unlucky hand.

60
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:48,172
We should consider ourselves lucky
that you have Camille.

61
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,134
And he is so excited.

62
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:58,015
Oh, and you will be
Madame Raquin, just like me.

63
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:02,899
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost.

64
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,108
Amen.

65
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,748
Children.

66
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,126
This way.

67
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,009
Set it there.

68
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,314
"I found the most
wonderful shop," you said.

69
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,895
I saw it in the daylight.

70
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,234
- "An enthralling arcade"?
- But it was enthralling.

71
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:15,949
Therese, let the young man pass.
He has work to do.

72
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:24,750
- It's smaller than you said, Mother.
- I adore this house. It's our new home.

73
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,960
- It's dark.
- Oh, well, be fair.

74
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,342
It's late. When the sun streams in,
it's lovely.

75
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,426
- It's mean.
- Oh, don't be silly.

76
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:42,312
Well, I will be cooped up all day,
content in my new job at the office...

77
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,770
...while you two girls will have each other
to thin the gloom.

78
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:50,062
- Customers bustling in and out.
- Oh, yes. Won't it be exciting?

79
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,528
Well, even I would admit,
my dear, that it needs a few touches.

80
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,035
Well, there were
financial limitations, of course.

81
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,240
I mean...

82
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,873
But I think we can do wonders
with the place, really.

83
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,046
Flowers on the windowsills
and wallpaper.

84
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,549
Curtains, of course.
Let me show you the upstairs.

85
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,085
Yes.

86
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,300
- We have a generous storeroom.
- Right.

87
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,926
<i>What do you do all day?</i>

88
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,506
You know what I do.

89
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,342
I don't.

90
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:03,226
- Go to the office.
- And then I come home.

91
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,605
- Are you happy?
- Not at the office.

92
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,601
- Where?
- At the zoo.

93
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,690
The zoo?

94
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:18,324
By the end of another meaningless
column of figures, my mind is blank.

95
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,319
It feels nice.

96
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:24,615
I let my feet decide the destination
and the rest of me sort of follows along.

97
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,955
- Your feet decide to go to the zoo?
- Well, yes.

98
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,417
I don't know why,
but four days out of five...

99
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,375
...I find myself outside a cage,
and I watch the bears.

100
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,043
I see.

101
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,140
I get to feel the ground shuddering
under my feet as they move about.

102
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,481
Where's my book?
Oh, I must have left it downstairs.

103
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,937
I'm too tired to read tonight.

104
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,325
Hey.

105
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,909
I might be a bear.

106
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,160
But you're not.

107
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,171
You're my little Therese.

108
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,896
- Candied grapefruit peel?
- No.

109
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,401
Camille is never this late.

110
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,153
Mother!

111
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,982
Finally.

112
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,871
I'll return in a moment, and no cheating.

113
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,655
Therese.

114
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,331
Camille, where have you been?
You've...?

115
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,955
I brought you a present.

116
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,544
Imported from your
long-lost past in Vernon.

117
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,923
You don't remember him.

118
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,883
- Do I?
- It's Laurent.

119
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,638
You must remember Laurent.

120
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,471
His father owned the dairy
beyond the church.

121
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:14,391
- Oh, my. Yes. Oh, my. Little Laurent.
- Yes.

122
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,939
This is before you came to live with us.

123
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,321
Oh, so long ago.

124
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,241
When I was a girl,
a summer day was just...

125
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,653
Let's not get started on summer days
or we'll die of hunger.

126
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,494
- Can you feed this great ox?
- Well, yes, of course I can.

127
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,125
Oh, little Laurent.
You can stay, can't you?

128
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,002
I would love to stay, thank you.

129
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,664
He works for the company too,
and we never knew.

130
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,831
Oh, my.

131
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,423
- I thought, "Bring him to dominoes night."
- Well, that's perfect.

132
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:45,259
Thursday evenings here
are always so exciting.

133
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,470
I mean, the banter,
especially Inspector Michaud.

134
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,601
And his son Olivier. He's fantastic.

135
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,728
Come, come.
You must meet everyone.

136
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,810
Oh, I will.

137
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,441
Therese, put the lights out, dear.

138
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,773
Good evening.

139
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,322
Welcome, Laurent. Olivier.

140
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,779
- Good evening.
- My wife, Suzanne.

141
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,535
Here you go, my friend.

142
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,537
Inspector, very good to meet you.

143
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,417
- Very nice.
- Well done.

144
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,170
Would you open a window, Therese?
I keep smelling an odor like gas.

145
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,556
- Yeah, it's probably me.
- Oh, no, certainly not.

146
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,217
Yes. Owing to an investigation...

147
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,730
...which I'm not at liberty to discuss,
I had to go to the morgue today.

148
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,936
It was rather warm. The aroma clings.

149
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:45,152
I seem to be having the slightest attack
of the vapors. Excuse me.

150
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,153
- Therese.
- Don't bother, she won't be long.

151
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:56,668
- Grapefruit peel?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

152
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,501
When I was a young police officer
like my son here...

153
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,338
...I wouldn't go down to the morgue at all.
I had to draw a line.

154
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,004
Send me into the nearest den
of thieves, unarmed.

155
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:12,638
I've been to the morgue myself,
a number of times.

156
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,854
What for? On a bet?

157
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,516
No, no, no. Not at all.
With my artist friends.

158
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,361
- You didn't paint, did you?
- I'm afraid I did.

159
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,316
While my father paid my way
in the mistaken assumption...

160
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,654
...that I was grooming myself
for the law.

161
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,946
- Were you good?
- No, not at all, but I liked the life.

162
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,208
- By "life" you must mean...
- He said life, he meant life.

163
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,035
Let's leave it at that.

164
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,498
But why the morgue?

165
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,336
We'd stand at the public rail
with pad in hand and sketch the bodies.

166
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,342
Wasn't there a supply
of warmer models?

167
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,345
- Obviously not.
- So why did you hang up your brush?

168
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,551
Well, my father
came to my garret one day...

169
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,725
...and my model opened the door
as she was.

170
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,811
My father was so shocked,
he took a step backwards...

171
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,068
...and fell down three flights of steps.

172
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,234
- Was he hurt?
- Oh, not a bit, but I was.

173
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:12,027
By the time he hit bottom,
he'd cut me off completely without a sou.

174
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,912
I haven't spoken
to the old skinflint since.

175
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,494
You weren't prepared
to starve for your art?

176
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:21,082
Do I look like a man
who would starve for his art?

177
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,916
I couldn't say you do.

178
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,627
No.

179
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,678
- Therese.
- I have to open a window.

180
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,013
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. The air is close.

181
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,770
- Won't you join us?
- No. My head is splitting.

182
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,478
- Laurent will think you don't like him.
- I don't.

183
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,359
He smells like an animal.
I can smell him from here.

184
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,284
Oh, Grivet, you've won again.

185
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,955
I've tried, but I just can't imagine it.

186
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,585
What?

187
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,246
Standing there
with palette and brush in hand...

188
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,461
...while a woman takes off her clothes.

189
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,341
Can't you?

190
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,469
- Therese!
- I wouldn't know where to look.

191
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,345
There are dozens of places.

192
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,851
- My hand would shake.
- Therese!

193
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,182
- Should you not see...?
- Don't move.

194
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,437
Sorry.

195
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,941
A customer probably
wandered into the shop by mistake.

196
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,519
I'd be hypnotized.

197
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,233
The model is hypnotized too.

198
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,107
Do you look at her face?

199
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,284
And I look at her body.

200
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,119
I listen and try to hear
what the body is saying.

201
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:44,957
- "I have to go wee"?
- Yeah, maybe.

202
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,337
The body says other things.

203
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,300
"Love me," I suppose.

204
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:55,134
The first model I ever had
was this beautiful redhead.

205
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,516
Natural red, as I quickly discovered.

206
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,679
With the only hitch being
that this wonderful creature...

207
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:05,018
...was deaf as a brick.

208
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,559
Couldn't call out
if I wanted adjustments.

209
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,779
I had to mold her like a sculptor...

210
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,699
...part by part

211
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:21,702
One afternoon,
I wanted her legs to be a bit wider.

212
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,867
So I went to move her knees apart
with my hands...

213
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,332
...but my touch was clumsy.

214
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,713
And then, on a hunch...

215
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,886
...I touched the inside of her thigh...

216
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,390
...with the tip of my brush.

217
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:49,730
Where the skin
is soft as cream and warm.

218
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,236
Lightest touch of camel's hair.

219
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,287
Did she make the small move
you were after?

220
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,072
She did.

221
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:09,586
- And what was her body saying to you?
- “Brush me again."

222
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:16,928
- Did Madame call?
- Yes, five minutes ago.

223
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,931
Is it done?

224
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,936
- It's a painting, Madame, not a roast.
- Great art takes time, Mother.

225
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,348
- Just one small peek.
- Can't be done.

226
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,231
But I could be called away to heaven
before it's completed.

227
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,895
No, I doubt it, Madame.

228
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,610
My guess is you'll see us
all snug in our graves.

229
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,275
What a horrible thought.

230
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,205
Mother, I'm posing.

231
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,283
So handsome.

232
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,161
Therese, now.

233
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,750
Don't move.

234
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,507
I've painted your shadow
into the picture.

235
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,770
Therese, I need my hot water bottle.
My feet are freezing.

236
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,556
Therese, honestly,
I wonder where your head is.

237
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,733
Can you come up here, please?

238
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,909
I look...

239
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:34,171
- ls "distinguished" the word?
- It's a word.

240
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,832
Thank you.

241
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:40,674
But it barely resembles you.
It's so blue.

242
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,848
And so gray.

243
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,808
It resembles my soul, Mother.

244
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,144
Is that what you were after? His soul?

245
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,308
I paint what I see, Madame.

246
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,690
- It does grow on one.
- So does mange.

247
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,358
No, don't belittle yourself.

248
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,494
You've given us a glimpse
of something...

249
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,952
...eternal.

250
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,832
Oh, no. Not a customer now.

251
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,369
Let me get a bottle
of champagne to celebrate.

252
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,957
- No, two bottles.
- Yes!

253
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,964
Then we can come back
and marvel at Laurent's masterpiece.

254
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,592
- But hurry.
- Of course.

255
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,221
Marvelous.

256
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:31,308
It really is an extraordinary thing.

257
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,722
Thank you, dear friend.

258
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,243
Do you like it?

259
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,868
You said you couldn't paint.

260
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,413
Unbutton your blouse.

261
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,253
We don't have time.

262
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,412
- Am I hurting you?
- Yes.

263
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:38,921
- Don't moan.
- Don't make a sound. Keep quiet.

264
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,148
Well, you're busy
as a little bee this morning.

265
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,113
I slept very well last night.

266
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,843
There?

267
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,727
Show me where.

268
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,892
Show me where.

269
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,771
There. Right there?

270
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,951
- Tomorrow. Don't be late.
- Yes.

271
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,959
Therese, I need you.

272
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,071
Well, we'll save them both for you...

273
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:35,238
...and you can stop in
once you've given it some thought.

274
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,907
Oh, that's what I'll do. Thank you.

275
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,432
Jesus, Camille,
you scared the hell out of me.

276
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,895
Will you join me for some lunch?
It's not a difficult question.

277
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,185
I'm sorry. The head clerk needs me
to run an errand for him.

278
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,523
I'll see you tonight?

279
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,359
- Tonight?
- It's Thursday.

280
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,944
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
I'll see you tonight.

281
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,905
I'm sorry, I'm late, Camille.

282
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:18,030
Come over whenever you want.
You're family now.

283
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,060
Your marriage bed?

284
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:46,317
Madame could come up here
at any minute.

285
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:49,024
She wouldn't dream
of leaving the shop.

286
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:53,066
Besides, I have a terrible headache
and need to rest.

287
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,993
You're afraid.

288
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:13,845
I can't believe that you're the same
lifeless girl who always sat in the corner.

289
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,842
You have no idea
how much they've stolen from me.

290
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,431
I almost ran away twice...

291
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,723
...but she always told me
I couldn't survive without them.

292
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,272
And I believed her.

293
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,687
There is nothing left of me...

294
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:39,153
...but a bit of burnt wick
and a wisp of smoke.

295
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,448
And look at you now.

296
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,830
So don't be afraid.

297
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:50,920
Danger passes by those
who look it right in the eye.

298
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:02,969
He still had her blood under
his fingernails when we found him.

299
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,472
Excuse me.

300
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,442
- Therese.
- She won't be long.

301
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,400
Thou shalt not.
Is it the sixth or the seventh?

302
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:18,784
- The seventh.
- The sixth and the seventh.

303
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,162
There is nothing but murder and lust.

304
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,746
To be stuffed into her own oven...

305
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,421
Hacked to bloody pieces
and baked in a pie.

306
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,255
Therese, it's your move.

307
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,100
Oh, now.

308
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,597
I had no idea you were such
a skillful player, Therese.

309
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:52,018
It's always the quiet ones in the corner
that you have to keep an eye on.

310
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,118
- I can't stand not being with you.
- Therese!

311
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,119
Oh, for God's sake.

312
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,530
Therese, are you ill?

313
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,449
I have a terrible migraine, Madame.

314
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:13,794
- Well, would you like a cup of tea?
- Maybe later. I need to rest.

315
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,475
- You like to lie.
- I do, and I'm good at it.

316
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,182
They made me good.

317
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,393
Thank you for locking me up
in a sickroom.

318
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,362
And thank you for burying me alive.
Oh, thank you.

319
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,648
Oh, thank you.

320
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,581
Therese, is the cat
coughing up fur balls again?

321
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,674
What's wrong?

322
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,145
You dug me up too late.

323
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,269
No.

324
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,019
No, just in time.

325
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,778
Just in time.

326
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:25,368
Save me.

327
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,330
Please save me.

328
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,566
I was sinking. I was sinking
into something cold and deep.

329
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,735
I couldn't breathe.

330
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,654
You were dreaming.

331
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,540
- What are you doing?
- Listening to the river.

332
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,839
That's just a brick wall, Therese.

333
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:28,466
- Do you often sit up alone at night?
- Sometimes.

334
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:34,184
You have secrets from me.
I didn't know.

335
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:40,770
Sometimes at night
I sit up at the window. That's all.

336
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,438
Come back to bed.

337
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,574
I want to hold you.
I never dream when I hold you.

338
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,461
I hated you.

339
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,127
You hated me?

340
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,426
Before you ever touched me.

341
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:15,312
I used to walk into a room
and I'd see you there.

342
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,519
And you'd barely look up.

343
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,988
I'd find myself moving around
and around your chair...

344
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:29,493
...hoping that a small part of my dress...

345
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,779
...or my hand might touch you.

346
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,745
Do you still hate me?

347
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,503
Yes.

348
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,164
Why?

349
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,508
Because you can leave me.

350
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,175
But I won't.

351
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,726
I promise.

352
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,514
I promise.

353
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,069
I promise.

354
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,489
Camille, what are we doing?

355
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,736
- Come to see my bear.
- Why?

356
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,451
Last week,
there was a young boy here...

357
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,117
...with a crust of bread
he'd spread with honey.

358
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,331
He threw it, but his aim was bad.

359
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,962
It hit the bear on the back
and it stuck there.

360
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,966
Poor thing could smell the honey,
but he couldn't quite reach it.

361
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,550
The bear went crazy.
The poor thing mauled itself.

362
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:39,309
Why dwell on it? It's sad.
Come on, let's go.

363
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,891
I don't know
how to make Therese happy.

364
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,488
Isn't she happy?

365
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,410
I don't even know how to tell anymore.

366
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,663
Just love her, Camille.

367
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,921
It just seemed so much easier
back in Vernon.

368
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:10,169
Just love her.
See if she comes around.

369
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,012
Come on, let's go.

370
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,475
I want to fall asleep in your arms.

371
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:03,347
I wish that could happen.

372
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,352
I want to touch your body
while you sleep.

373
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:13,949
I want to wake up
with your tongue inside me.

374
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,450
Therese.

375
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,656
Therese, I made you
some chamomile tea.

376
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,493
Oh, my God. Get under my skirts.

377
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,913
Therese?

378
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,497
- Open your legs.
- No.

379
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,004
- I can't breathe.
- I don't care.

380
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,424
Were you dozing, dear?

381
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,133
- I thought I heard you muttering.
- Maybe I was. I don't remember.

382
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,014
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

383
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:42,644
- How's your head? Still agonizing?
- It comes and goes.

384
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,725
Perhaps I should rub your neck.

385
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,890
Oh, you know, I don't think that's...

386
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,434
Oh, it always helped
when you were small.

387
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,646
You know, you've had
so many headaches lately.

388
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,736
Perhaps we should talk to the doctor.

389
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:59,529
I need you by my side, dear,
down in the shop.

390
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,472
- Is that better?
- Oh, yes.

391
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,009
Thank you.

392
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,398
You should start getting
packing material from Fragnet's shop.

393
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,562
What for?

394
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,692
We're moving back to Vernon.

395
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,288
What?

396
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,873
Paris is so bad for my health.
All the filth and soot.

397
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,588
But your job, the shop?

398
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,917
Both easily replaced in Vernon.

399
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,883
Camille. Camille.

400
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,467
When were you going
to discuss this with me?

401
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,431
I like Paris.

402
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,849
Mother says you've been getting
terrible migraines every afternoon...

403
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,607
...so it's better for you too.

404
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,737
- The air is much cleaner in Vernon.
- What's gotten into you?

405
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,576
I'm the husband. I make the decisions.

406
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,034
Yeah, but we have friends here
and our business.

407
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,493
Therese.

408
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:30,877
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

409
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,795
We will live out our lives together
away from this filthy city...

410
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:37,334
...and all will be fine.

411
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,473
Therese, it's time for bed.

412
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,982
- Therese?
- Yes.

413
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,071
What are you doing?

414
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:08,829
- Checking that the door is locked.
- Go to bed this instant. It's late.

415
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,136
Good evening, Monsieur Janoux.

416
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,858
Oh, I can't live without you any longer.

417
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:56,330
- If only he'd go away...
- Well, people don't just go away.

418
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,715
Sometimes they do.

419
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:06,302
But it's dangerous...

420
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,810
...for the people they leave behind.

421
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,557
Not if the going away is an accident.

422
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,355
People have accidents every day...

423
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,909
...and sometimes
they just don't come back.

424
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,410
That's all.

425
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,424
I have to go.

426
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,091
Therese.

427
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,765
Do I own you?

428
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,603
Completely.

429
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,273
Do I own you?

430
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:04,481
Yes. Yes.

431
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,558
For you.

432
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,937
They're supposed
to go into water, Therese.

433
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,653
Oh, and don't tell Mother.
She'll be jealous.

434
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,673
Feels like summer's nearly over.

435
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,334
The leaves will be falling
before we know it.

436
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,094
Why does that happen?

437
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,925
Listen.

438
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,342
- What?
- I hear water.

439
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,476
Maybe it's the leaves drifting down.

440
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,765
It's the river,
beyond those trees over there.

441
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,684
Why don't we rent a boat
and row out into the sunset?

442
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,945
Just let me sit down for a moment.

443
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,525
- Are you tired?
- Oh, I'm exhausted.

444
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,864
I couldn't have trudged another step.

445
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,406
Just let me catch up
with a couple of winks.

446
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,074
Therese.

447
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,620
Notice this, Laurent.

448
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,709
If you get married, you'll find yourself
with a portable pillow.

449
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:51,129
Don't flaunt your good fortune,
my friend.

450
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:56,890
- Oh, we must have walked 20 miles.
- Maybe two.

451
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,429
I'm getting old.

452
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,558
What an odd thought.

453
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,739
Are you warm enough?

454
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,205
Camille.

455
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,867
Camille.

456
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,883
- Don't.
- I have to touch you.

457
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,613
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

458
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:54,116
No, you don't know.
There, clomping through the leaves.

459
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:59,455
- Isn't that Therese?
- Oh, look, Laurent, Therese.

460
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,537
Laurent!

461
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,414
Oh, sorry.

462
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,129
- Is he sick?
- Oh, no. He's napping.

463
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:13,219
On the damp ground?
His mother would have a heart attack.

464
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,463
I won't tell if you won't.

465
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,219
What happened to your foot?

466
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,226
- Oh, a blister.
- I got one too.

467
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,262
I told you this walk was too far.

468
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,727
Well, we're leaving now,
aren't we, darling?

469
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,315
Without doing the single thing
we came to do.

470
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,479
If you want to rent a boat, Suzanne...

471
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,490
...and row out into the fading light,
be my guest.

472
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:37,368
I'm going home. Good afternoon.

473
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,654
Can I tell you something, Therese?

474
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,991
All men are pigs.

475
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,002
Why can't you two
be civil to one another?

476
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,254
- She wants to go on a boat.
- Wait.

477
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,999
She wants to go on a boat.
Last time...

478
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,089
- ...you knocked the oar into the water.
- Olivier, wait. Wait for me!

479
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,631
- Will you control your temper?
- Have a good afternoon.

480
00:45:57,797 --> 00:46:00,346
Might have been able to go on a boat
this summer.

481
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,637
But somebody was taking their time
choosing the right dress.

482
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:07,228
Let's have a lovely walk by the river.

483
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,234
We should go.

484
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,020
- Where?
- Back.

485
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,856
To what?

486
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,539
- I'd never make a sailor.
- Easy.

487
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:25,621
I'm terrified of water.

488
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,535
Don't be such a baby.

489
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:30,080
If God had intended us
to conquer the waves...

490
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,715
...he'd have fitted us
with pontoons, not feet.

491
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,467
Just sit down. Don't stand in the boat.

492
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,128
Sit.

493
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:47,138
When we were little, remember, Therese,
you'd make me play that game?

494
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,852
Remember?

495
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:51,564
We'd sit in our room
and the sun would go down...

496
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:55,401
...and you'd say,
“Don't light a candle yet."

497
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,402
The light would fade...

498
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:00,906
...but we could still just make out
things in the room...

499
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,945
...the table, the rug, the vase.

500
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,456
Then they lost their color.

501
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,831
Then their edges.

502
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,456
Therese?

503
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,337
- When it was completely dark...
- Get in the boat.

504
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:17,002
...It'd feel like there was almost
someone else with us there in the room.

505
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:21,844
I'd want to strike a match,
but you called me a baby. Remember?

506
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,849
I love you.

507
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:31,900
Well, at least I'm not afraid of boats,
like some babies I could mention.

508
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:26,158
Is there anything as depressingly calm
as a Sunday afternoon?

509
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,136
- Camille!
- Man over!

510
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,178
Camille! I have to go back in!

511
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,472
- Laurent!
- Camille? Laurent.

512
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,515
Oh, my goodness.

513
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,480
My dear, what's wrong?

514
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:43,239
- No! No!
- We have to find him! Camille! Camille!

515
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,274
Oh, my God!

516
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,328
Get him up. Help him up.

517
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,329
No! No!

518
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:08,263
I told him to stop dancing around
in the boat.

519
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,517
I told him.

520
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,269
And then the boat tipped over.

521
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,931
You did all that was humanly possible.

522
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,724
She's got a fever.

523
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,444
He kept shouting, "Save my Therese."

524
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,734
You die just like that,
in the twinkle of an eye.

525
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,618
Horrible, just horrible.

526
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:33,114
A report will have to be filed.

527
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,127
Certainly someone saw something,
and they will find the body.

528
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,384
No, wait here. You've been
through enough today, dear boy.

529
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,595
We'll take over now.

530
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,148
I should go to Madame.

531
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,793
We have a long way to go.

532
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:26,509
- You can never leave me now.
- Be strong.

533
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:36,014
I think you should come in now.

534
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:40,522
No, no, no!

535
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,560
No, no!

536
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,948
Therese, Madame needs you now.

537
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,330
Oh, no. Oh, no.

538
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:06,257
Where's my boy? Where's my boy?

539
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:12,547
No, no, no!

540
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,728
Oh, no, no, no.

541
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:27,903
My boy! Where's my boy?

542
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,736
Oh, no!

543
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,472
Amen.

544
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,310
Amen.

545
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,319
I'm so sorry, Madame. I'm so sorry.

546
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,077
I'd do it all again if I had to.

547
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:06,327
I love you.

548
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:30,294
- Therese, please, let me do it.
- No, I want to keep busy.

549
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:45,510
I see him sometimes,
breaking the surface.

550
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,599
Have some tea, Madame.

551
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,891
Swelling and bursting apart.

552
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:55,311
Madame, I beg you.

553
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,859
And other times...

554
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,955
Other times, I see the boat tipping...

555
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,461
...and I see him falling.

556
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:17,633
And then I see him swimming away.

557
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:22,972
Flopping up onto a bank,
exhausted but happy.

558
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:28,219
And I wonder, "Why...

559
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,975
...couldn't it be that way?"

560
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,480
Tea, Madame.

561
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,867
Have my son bring it to me.

562
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,795
Therese...

563
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,804
Madame, you should come inside.

564
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,658
- You did this.
- No, I don't know what you mean.

565
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:28,662
You... You took your eyes off of him.
You weren't watching.

566
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,664
You were supposed to be
his guardian angel.

567
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,700
Madame, accidents happen every day.

568
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:39,670
When the boat tipped over,
how did you survive?

569
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:45,838
How did you survive while my child
sank down into the blackness?

570
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:51,352
What were you doing? Tell me, tell me.
Oh, God, tell me. What were you doing?

571
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,855
- Madame, I tried.
- No, you didn't.

572
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,517
You let him die.

573
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:04,194
How'd you manage to live
and not him?

574
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,530
How?

575
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:11,038
He should be standing
right here beside me.

576
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:17,078
Not you, not you, not you! Not you!

577
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,581
Not you!

578
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,136
Madame.

579
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,272
Therese. Oh, my baby girl.

580
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:45,739
I didn't mean those things I said.
I didn't mean...

581
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:51,320
Something has reached inside me...

582
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:55,332
...and destroyed my heart and my mind.

583
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,333
Oh, my sweet girl.

584
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,678
Is she sleeping?

585
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,673
Yes.

586
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,680
Perhaps we should leave.

587
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,595
Please stay.

588
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:05,686
We... We weren't sure whether
to come here even after you invited us.

589
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:09,026
But it's been so long
and we've missed your at-homes.

590
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:13,365
Well, she's missed them too.
Please, stay.

591
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,132
I had to be near you.

592
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,214
Near whom, Therese?
Did you say something?

593
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:35,014
No, Mother.
You must have been dreaming.

594
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:43,853
How long does it take to drown?

595
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,404
To sink down into the murk, how long?

596
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:55,069
- It's very late.
- We've worn you down.

597
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:57,237
Oh, no, no.

598
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,831
I'm thankful for that.
And please do come again soon.

599
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:09,000
Madame, you must try not to imagine
Camille in bits and pieces.

600
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,220
How should I imagine him?

601
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,011
Gone, just gone.

602
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,510
Gone?

603
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,017
We'll see ourselves out.

604
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,023
Just go.

605
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,776
If I make grief an inconvenience...

606
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,786
Perhaps it pains them
to see you suffer.

607
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:42,449
- You have a kind heart.
- Oh, it's nothing, Madame.

608
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:44,289
No.

609
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,207
No, it's not nothing.

610
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,378
It's comfort, Laurent,
and you give it gladly.

611
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,805
- Lock up the shop as you leave.
- Of course.

612
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:14,990
Therese, I need you.

613
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,680
Don't ever do that to me again.

614
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:33,023
Therese, I can't sleep.
I haven't slept in months.

615
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:38,532
- Let me come to your room tonight.
- No. No, we have to wait.

616
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:45,868
- Why did we kill him?
- To be together.

617
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,248
Exactly.

618
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:55,048
I can't sleep.
I keep having nightmares about it.

619
01:03:55,707 --> 01:04:01,214
Darling, as soon as we're married
and sleep in the same bed together...

620
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:05,384
- ...all of the nightmares will stop.
- Let's just leave. We'll leave tonight.

621
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,723
- I don't care where we go.
- Therese, stop.

622
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:11,607
If we left right now,
we'd go straight to the guillotine. Soon.

623
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,645
- We'll have each other and the shop.
- Oh, I don't care about the shop.

624
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:20,315
Well, you should care about the shop.
It's yours now.

625
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:23,326
I don't know, Laurent.
Everything is in her name.

626
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,329
Nothing was in his name,
not even a bank account.

627
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:29,833
- What?
- Yes. Nothing.

628
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:37,711
Can you grieve a little more?

629
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,965
Therese, have you made any tea?

630
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:53,015
Therese, what is that sound?

631
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,356
Therese?

632
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,858
Therese?

633
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,329
- Suzanne.
- My, you scared me.

634
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,996
Just making sure
all the doors were locked up tight.

635
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,170
I never realized
the shop had a side door.

636
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,011
Both doors are secure.

637
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,598
It's heartbreaking. Just heartbreaking.

638
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,636
- Perhaps we should just let them be.
- I should help...

639
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:34,682
It's a beautiful evening.
Let me walk you home.

640
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,686
We'll take the long way.

641
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:42,815
Yes.

642
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,072
- How sick is Therese?
- I beg your pardon?

643
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:53,037
She's as white as a slab of marble,
Madame.

644
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,500
Her eyes are empty, her skin is dull,
and either she's sick as a dog or...

645
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:58,709
Or what?

646
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:01,341
Or she's sicker of lying alone
in an empty bed.

647
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,378
- Father.
- Well, wouldn't you be?

648
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,555
I only wonder
if anyone even remembers.

649
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,674
Remembers what, Madame?

650
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:15,723
That I had a son
who died just eight months ago.

651
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,860
- But shouldn't Therese move on?
- Oh, well, of course she should.

652
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:28,319
I don't... I don't know.
It's as if she's fading away.

653
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:30,362
I've seen many things in my life...

654
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,031
...and I can tell you
with absolute certainty...

655
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,326
...that woman
is dying of a broken heart.

656
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,087
From a bleeding wound
that never heals.

657
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,001
- Marriage is the cure.
- Marriage?

658
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:51,842
No. Oh, no, no, no.
That's not possible, no.

659
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:57,849
- Who would she marry?
- Well, who else but Laurent?

660
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:00,980
Laurent.

661
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:10,114
More respectful to Camille's memory
than were she to marry a stranger.

662
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,946
A stranger.

663
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,792
Oh, no. No.

664
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,212
No, not a stranger.

665
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:28,466
Not at this late chapter in my life.
A stranger?

666
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,303
They're watching us.

667
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:48,278
- Do you miss me?
- Yes.

668
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,740
That's not very convincing.

669
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,748
Well, sometimes at night when I'm afraid,
I miss you then.

670
01:07:56,906 --> 01:08:00,661
- Only sometimes?
- Well, sometimes...

671
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:05,628
...I lie in my great big bed completely
alone for the first time in my life...

672
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,293
...and I feel like a little girl again.

673
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:14,804
Well, once we're married,
it'll be like it used to be.

674
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,223
Have you taken a mistress?

675
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,640
No.

676
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,651
I can smell her from here.

677
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,319
What does she look like?

678
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:39,707
- She looks like you, but it's over.
- Really? Why?

679
01:08:39,866 --> 01:08:41,834
Because I couldn't
remember her name.

680
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,042
I'd be dreaming
and I'd whisper your name in her ear.

681
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,673
- Does she have red hair?
- Therese...

682
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:55,679
With the love and support
of our dear friends...

683
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:00,016
- ...I'm ready to discuss your marriage.
- Marriage, Mother?

684
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:02,681
But to whom?

685
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,401
But I love Laurent as a brother.

686
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:12,282
I happily accept, Madame,
if Therese will have me.

687
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,618
Camille slipped from these hands.

688
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:27,418
I will never let that happen to you.

689
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,126
Ever.

690
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,790
<i>Since Therese is the fast of our family“...</i>

691
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:16,134
<i>...I have decided to change my will
and put it in both of your names.</i>

692
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:24,434
Upon my passing, you will receive
the shop and 20,000 francs.

693
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:29,275
Well, it's hardly a fortune,
but it'll be yours.

694
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,985
Bound by a tie
more powerful than love, money.

695
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,401
Shall we go celebrate?

696
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:56,548
Madame's really outdone herself
with our room.

697
01:10:56,711 --> 01:11:00,887
New sheets, fresh flowers.

698
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,179
Therese.

699
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,482
- Madame has...
- Take it down.

700
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:15,771
It's only a painting.

701
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,942
If it's only a painting,
why are we whispering?

702
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:30,540
That scar on your neck.

703
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:36,209
- It was bright red today at the church.
- Was it?

704
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,171
- How did you...?
- Don't.

705
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:50,690
We've dreamt of this moment for so long
and now the dream's come true.

706
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:56,734
Remember you said that
you wanted to fall asleep in my arms...

707
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,399
...and wake up
with me warm beside you?

708
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:01,735
Did I?

709
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,080
Yes. And now we can.

710
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,910
- Now that Camille is gone...
- Oh, no. Why did you say his name?

711
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,579
- What? You say it.
- Oh, I can't.

712
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:13,917
Therese, say it.

713
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,588
- Camille.
- See? What happened?

714
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,841
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

715
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,509
Why?

716
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,022
Because he's gone. He's dead.

717
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:35,185
Camille? Camille?

718
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,900
How badly did he die?

719
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,379
You didn't see?

720
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,542
I closed my eyes.

721
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:02,049
When?

722
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:05,135
Hey, stop it. You're tickling me. No!

723
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,222
I was gentle, Therese.

724
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,810
I lowered him into the water
like it was a bath.

725
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:18,978
Show me how.

726
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:27,115
- He didn't fight?
- No, he was quiet like it was bath time.

727
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,280
Show me.

728
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:39,124
Don't lie to me.
He didn't go gently, did he?

729
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,509
I closed my eyes.
I couldn't close my ears.

730
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:44,511
I heard him call my name. "Therese!"

731
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,850
Therese! Therese!

732
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,351
- "Therese!"
- Stop it!

733
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:00,694
Stop it.

734
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,521
Do you know what tonight is?

735
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,024
I'd almost forgotten.

736
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:52,412
It's our wedding night.

737
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:59,371
We were married the moment
I stepped into that boat.

738
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:15,307
Madame.

739
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:20,976
Oh, perhaps Therese
might like a ginger biscuit.

740
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,484
Every afternoon since the wedding.

741
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:32,324
I'm not much for napping myself.

742
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,637
- Do you like the chicken?
- Yes. Thank you for bringing me lunch.

743
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:55,974
Lunchtime used to mean
something very different for us.

744
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,349
We're settling in.

745
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,478
I have to get back to work.

746
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,906
- Mother.
- When I was a girl, a summer's day...

747
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:16,414
- Oh, there she goes again.
- Tell us about a summer's day.

748
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,626
I babble on and on and on...

749
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,005
...as I drift away.

750
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:29,343
How long will it take?

751
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:34,011
I think I shall turn...

752
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:38,177
...and see someone I knew.

753
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,858
Someone I loved.

754
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:52,029
A summer's day, spun out like...

755
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,862
...sugar...

756
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,293
...spun white.

757
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:11,211
- What spun? What?
- You said a day.

758
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:15,473
We thought the cowpats
were stepping-stones...

759
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:20,182
...and my sister, Amalie,
stepped on one.

760
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:24,144
And screamed again,
and I laughed so hard, I thought...

761
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,684
<i>Mother.</i>

762
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,042
Madame? Laurent!

763
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:46,921
- Madame?
- Mother.

764
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:51,171
Try to get her to move unassisted
as often as possible.

765
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,677
- The smallest movement will help.
- Certainly.

766
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,840
And encourage her to talk,
even moan a little.

767
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,680
The slightest sound
may help her regain her speech.

768
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:03,267
- So how can she be able to...?
- You know...

769
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:07,434
...she's very lucky to have the two of you
to watch over her.

770
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:11,446
- Good night.
- Good night, doctor.

771
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,118
We're all alone now.

772
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:06,041
Carry her down to the shop
before you leave.

773
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,792
All right.

774
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,295
Ready, Mother?

775
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,679
All right.

776
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:36,443
You need both of our signatures
to get the money.

777
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:41,152
- Good morning!
- We'll be right down.

778
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:52,709
- Laurent, time to go home.
- Yeah. Just finishing up.

779
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:16,191
You should learn how to cook.

780
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:20,532
You should learn how to eat.

781
01:20:20,691 --> 01:20:23,035
If only I was more like Camille...

782
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:32,211
Well, it's getting late, isn't it?
You should be in bed.

783
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:42,380
I don't know who you are sometimes.

784
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,059
Till death do us part, dear.

785
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:58,237
- Therese!
- What?

786
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,398
Stop the ticking.

787
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:05,445
The ticking is the only thing
that drowns you out.

788
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:13,794
- I'm not saying a word.
- You are. I can hear you.

789
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,749
- What am I saying?
- Exactly what I'm saying.

790
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:20,505
You're not saying anything.

791
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,841
The boat, the afternoon.

792
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:27,850
- The sun going down, the fog...
- Shut up. Come here, come here!

793
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:31,433
The shore is gone, the boat is drifting.

794
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:37,519
- We're all alone. He sees my face.
- He starts to shout.

795
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,778
- I grab his throat.
- “Therese!"

796
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,985
I lift him up and he bites my neck.

797
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:44,608
- He screams your name.
- “Therese!"

798
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:47,654
- I heave him in!
- "Therese!"

799
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:53,287
And then he's gone.

800
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,870
That's right, he's gone.

801
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,882
- You killed him.
- What?

802
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:04,378
Liar! You liar! Liar!

803
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:08,341
You wanted him dead!
You begged me to kill him!

804
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,807
- We killed him!
- Then why does he only haunt you?

805
01:22:11,969 --> 01:22:16,270
Are you out of your mind?
You know he comes to you every night.

806
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:19,686
He slithers into your dreams,
and you wake up screaming.

807
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:25,200
I scream because you hold on too tight
and your nails bite into my skin!

808
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,708
Oh, God.

809
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:07,154
Go ahead, say something.

810
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,653
Spit in my face.

811
01:23:12,988 --> 01:23:14,240
Tell me to go to hell.

812
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,377
Where do you think you are now?

813
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:25,960
Therese!

814
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,424
Therese, where are you going?
Get over here.

815
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,715
- Let go of me!
- What are you doing?

816
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:37,781
Tea, Madame?

817
01:24:40,659 --> 01:24:43,503
Six or the two?

818
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:53,013
Oh, I see. She sparkles at the six
and won't look at the two, so six.

819
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:58,643
Simple.
My mind over her dead matter.

820
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:02,310
- Then what is she writing?
- Beg your pardon?

821
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:08,320
While you were going on,
her fingers were tracing letters. Watch.

822
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:17,530
Start over again, Madame.

823
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,214
- What's that look like?
- I don't know.

824
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,965
- It's a T.
- It's a T, isn't it?

825
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,546
- Isn't that a T?
- Yeah.

826
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,346
H.

827
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:42,680
- E, "The." The something.
- The...

828
01:25:42,846 --> 01:25:45,520
- Let me see.
- Darling, just a minute.

829
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:47,684
R.

830
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,897
- E.
- E.

831
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:55,819
- "There but for the grace..."
- Shut up, Grivet.

832
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,076
What's the next one?

833
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,074
- S. Is that an S?
- It's an S. That is an S.

834
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,083
- E.
- E. "Therese."

835
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:06,244
- E. "Therese."
- Thank you, professor.

836
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,288
She's written "Therese."

837
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:11,717
"Therese..."

838
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:17,214
- "Therese..."
- “And..."

839
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,554
- "Therese and..."
- “Therese and Laurent!"

840
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:22,344
That's what she's written,
"Therese and Laurent."

841
01:26:24,304 --> 01:26:25,806
"Therese and Laurent."

842
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:27,019
- A.
- A.

843
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,855
A.

844
01:26:30,644 --> 01:26:31,896
- R.
- R.

845
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:40,613
- E.
- E. "Therese and Laurent are..."

846
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:42,452
What, Madame?

847
01:26:57,003 --> 01:27:01,008
- She's tired herself.
- No need for her to finish.

848
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,268
Just look in her eyes.

849
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:06,101
"Therese and Laurent are...

850
01:27:06,263 --> 01:27:10,689
...wonderful children
who treat me very well."

851
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,819
Am I right?

852
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:16,736
- Why is she crying?
- Gratitude.

853
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,651
No, Mother.

854
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,321
We are the ones
that are grateful to you.

855
01:27:32,414 --> 01:27:34,542
- To the perfect couple.
- Yes.

856
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,133
This is a happy home.
Good people live here.

857
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,194
Are those headaches back?

858
01:27:58,023 --> 01:28:00,025
I can't take it.

859
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:06,782
The two of you can't fool me
for another moment.

860
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:14,124
I predict an addition to this little family
in eight months.

861
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:19,295
No, Suzanne, I'm...
No, I'm certain. That's not it.

862
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:42,985
Thank you.

863
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,655
Thank you.

864
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:54,876
I'm going to go lie down.
My head is throbbing.

865
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,878
I'll listen for the bell.

866
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:29,114
I forgot my buttons.

867
01:29:47,591 --> 01:29:51,767
I've changed my mind.
I have to get out of here.

868
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,987
Go ahead.

869
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:08,157
Might bore a hole right through me.
Right here.

870
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:12,832
Who sold me into marriage?

871
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:18,998
Who would do anything
to keep from being alone?

872
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:22,251
You.

873
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:15,187
Drink up. It's time to go.
The bar closed half an hour ago.

874
01:31:15,345 --> 01:31:17,689
- Sorry, darling.
- No, don't leave.

875
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:19,690
Well, we can't stay here.

876
01:31:19,849 --> 01:31:23,524
- Don't leave. Don't leave. Please stay.
- I'm sorry, darling.

877
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:35,540
No, please stay.

878
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,034
You must stay.

879
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:42,038
Can I buy you a drink?

880
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,050
I have one.

881
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:50,801
Can I buy you?

882
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,927
I'm free.

883
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:04,319
Get up on this table.
Come on. Lift your skirt.

884
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,690
For what?

885
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:14,495
Come on, you'll see.

886
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:17,203
This will make it all better.

887
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:25,837
- Hang on.
- Go on. Yeah.

888
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:28,297
One second. Hold on.

889
01:32:32,172 --> 01:32:34,300
I don't want you.

890
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:08,167
Prussic acid. Quick as lightning.

891
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:12,008
Tiniest drop,
you'll never see those rats again.

892
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,848
Have a good morning.

893
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,519
Laurent?

894
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:29,025
Laurent, come and get her.

895
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:18,654
Hello?

896
01:34:25,618 --> 01:34:27,245
Hello?

897
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:32,834
Madame?

898
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:34,840
Hello?

899
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,103
We'll be right down, Suzanne.

900
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,192
Careful!

901
01:34:58,735 --> 01:35:00,408
Suzanne?

902
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:23,135
I loved your son. Please.

903
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:29,312
And if you could forgive me,
I'd kill myself and end in peace.

904
01:35:30,058 --> 01:35:33,403
Please, do you forgive me?

905
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:37,448
Do you forgive...? Do you forgive me?

906
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:41,031
- Get off the ﬂoor.
- Forgive me, please.

907
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:42,867
- Oh, get off the ﬂoor!
- Please.

908
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:45,452
Yes, she forgives you! Look!
She forgives you!

909
01:35:45,615 --> 01:35:50,963
She wishes that she had a dozen children
so you could kill them all as well!

910
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,333
- They've come for us, Therese.
- I'm sorry.

911
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,967
Go see who it is.

912
01:35:56,834 --> 01:35:58,177
I want this over.

913
01:35:58,836 --> 01:36:02,807
Therese, go see who it is. Go!

914
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,639
Go!

915
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:23,995
May I help you, sir?

916
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,621
- Olivier.
- I didn't hear you come down.

917
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:33,835
- Is Suzanne with you?
- No. No, I was just passing by.

918
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:37,672
- We haven't seen you in so long.
- I know. Madame has been very ill.

919
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:40,508
- May I say hello to her?
- She's sound asleep.

920
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:45,016
- I'll tell her you stopped in.
- Yes, let her know that we send our best.

921
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:50,180
Hopefully we'll start
our Thursday evenings very soon.

922
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:54,522
- She misses them so much.
- As do we.

923
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:56,853
Olivier.

924
01:37:00,189 --> 01:37:02,408
Your hat.

925
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,043
Have a good morning.

926
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:47,829
Oh, no. The shop is completely empty.
It's been abandoned.

927
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:52,250
This way? The river.
They were headed this way.

928
01:38:10,802 --> 01:38:14,397
- Did you ever love me?
- Yes.

929
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,647
When he was alive.

930
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,817
I love you.

931
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,655
- After I killed him...
- We killed him.

932
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,001
- Do you want some wine?
- Yes.

933
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:21,338
I want to kiss you.

934
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:25,460
From your neck to your thigh.

935
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:30,802
- Put my tongue inside...
- We did all that.

936
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:52,908
Do it.

937
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,825
No.

938
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:59,042
You.

939
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:19,748
- This way, this way.
- Down there.

940
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,335
Therese!
