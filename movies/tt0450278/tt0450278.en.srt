1
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,031
- Amsterdam, motherfucker.
- Okay.

2
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,972
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

3
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,144
Red-light district. Time for sneepur.

4
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,927
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some sneepur.

5
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,376
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

6
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,333
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

7
00:02:37,506 --> 00:02:39,036
I came all the way from Iceland.

8
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:41,819
- Yeah, what if we did?
- We did that every day in college.

9
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:44,164
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

10
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:46,315
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

11
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:47,750
How about the hemp museum?

12
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:53,947
Oli proudly presents...

13
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:57,630
...Isabella.

14
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,077
She's cute.

15
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:03,631
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

16
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:06,074
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

17
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:09,159
- Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
- Fucking Oli.

18
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,463
The Icelandic...
Oh, God, how are you?

19
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,455
You want to get stoned?

20
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:18,495
- This will wake you up.
- What the fuck?

21
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:25,265
This is good Amsterdam shit.

22
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,865
That's the shit right there, dude.

23
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:32,741
Trust me.

24
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:38,867
Yeah.

25
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,017
- It's all good, bro.
- Yeah, dude, smoke it!

26
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,605
- Dude, what happened?
- Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

27
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,485
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

28
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,934
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

29
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,992
- Do you guys want another round?
- Yes, okay.

30
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:12,637
Yeah?

31
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,763
We will be right back.

32
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,348
- What are you doing?
- What?

33
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:27,705
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

34
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,908
Wait. There's a guy.

35
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:31,427
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

36
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:34,168
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

37
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:37,349
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

38
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,263
- All right?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:40,602
Where's Oli?

40
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,735
He's fucking genius.

41
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,364
Sneepur alert, 3 o'clock.

42
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,779
- She smokes.
- Dude, it's Europe!

43
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,331
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

44
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,482
You are so easy sometimes.

45
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:07,066
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

46
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,171
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,590
Yeah, I...
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

48
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:20,864
No, I'm sorry, I...

49
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,781
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

50
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:25,553
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Hey. Hey.

51
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,500
Come on, faggot.

52
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,526
- Fucker!
- Get your fucking hands off me.

53
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:36,238
- I'm an American, I got rights.
- Get the fuck out.

54
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,727
- Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
- Kiss my American ass, fucker.

55
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,737
- Fuck you.
- Let's get out of here, bro.

56
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,885
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

57
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:47,229
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

58
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:49,813
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

59
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,478
That shit was classic, dude.

60
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,661
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

61
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,215
I'm fucking awesome!

62
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,221
I don't fucking know what...

63
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:02,239
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

64
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,974
You are fucking Israeli.

65
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:07,901
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

66
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:11,109
...because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

67
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,623
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

68
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,112
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

69
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:21,098
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

70
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:24,649
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

71
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,092
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

72
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,298
I agree, but I shouldn't
have to pay for it.

73
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,543
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

74
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,077
Hey.

75
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,560
Are you okay?

76
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:05,548
Hello? Hello?

77
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:13,750
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

78
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:15,629
Sorry. Jesus.

79
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:17,975
You're up, slugger.

80
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:22,462
Man, I'm fucking... I'm tired, man.
I can, like, barely stand up.

81
00:07:22,636 --> 00:07:24,635
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

82
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:27,589
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

83
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,749
- What do we have in here?
- Hey, you watch, you pay.

84
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,364
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

85
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:45,001
Hey.

86
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:48,321
Come, sit.

87
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,587
Your friends are so funny.

88
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:57,135
Yeah.

89
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,686
You can wash over here, by sink.

90
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,232
It was fine.

91
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,651
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

92
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:24,065
It was fine. It was whatever.

93
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,530
What was that?

94
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:33,684
- It's fucking after curfew, man.
- Curfew? What are we, 13?

95
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:37,428
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

96
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:40,208
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

97
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:41,651
This is bullshit.

98
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,058
Hello?

99
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,830
Open the fucking door.

100
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:52,868
- What did you tell him?
- He just told them to let us in.

101
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:57,827
- Shut up!
- Jesus.

102
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,779
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

103
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,790
Hey, I know what to do.

104
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:08,387
Shut up.

105
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:12,298
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

106
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,579
Come on.

107
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,915
Go. Go, go, go.

108
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,125
Oh, don't mind them.

109
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:29,178
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

110
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:34,072
- Thanks, bro.
- It's no problem.

111
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:37,252
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

112
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,866
Paxton.

113
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,264
Alexei. But call me Alex.

114
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:50,050
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

115
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:52,265
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

116
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,008
I'm the first in line for sneepur.

117
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,095
Oh, that's Icelandic for "clit."

118
00:10:00,544 --> 00:10:03,423
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

119
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:04,654
Women have it.

120
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:08,874
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

121
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:12,262
Oh, yeah.
Very good sneepur in Iceland.

122
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,845
- Yeah.
- Come on, guys, have a seat.

123
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,158
Where you travel to?

124
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:27,503
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

125
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,275
Anyway, we went all over France...

126
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:32,399
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

127
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,068
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

128
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:38,285
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

129
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,673
...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass seסoritas.

130
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,814
Looking for girls?

131
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,165
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,787
So talk to Alex.

133
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:54,868
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

134
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,209
I can help you.

135
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:00,133
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

136
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,441
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

137
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,092
- Yeah.
- Good.

138
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,892
You looking for girls like this?

139
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,191
These are fucking magnificent.

140
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:29,244
- Who the hell are these girls?
- You have to go east, my friend.

141
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:31,479
This is where the best girls are.

142
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:32,993
The best.

143
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,002
How far east?

144
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:38,120
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

145
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:42,268
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

146
00:11:42,443 --> 00:11:44,042
...just outside Bratislava.

147
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,659
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

148
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,486
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

149
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,264
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

150
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:57,611
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

151
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,882
Josh.

152
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,867
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

153
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:06,218
Barcelona, so many Americans.

154
00:12:06,394 --> 00:12:08,529
But Slovakia? No one there.

155
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:12,622
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

156
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,098
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

157
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:18,880
They go crazy for any foreigner.

158
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,826
You just...

159
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,975
...take them.

160
00:12:52,084 --> 00:12:53,888
Fuck, man.

161
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,950
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

162
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,928
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

163
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,168
- Okay, all right.
- My Viking balls too.

164
00:13:04,344 --> 00:13:05,783
Okay, stop.

165
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:19,307
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:21,015
My daughter.

167
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:23,193
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

168
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,970
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

169
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,866
- Saskia.
- Cute.

170
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,020
- She's adorable.
- She's a little cutie, yeah.

171
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:39,282
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

172
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,014
- Very pretty.
- She's 6.

173
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:43,225
She's starting school this year.

174
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:45,846
Wait, you have a daughter?

175
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:48,860
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

176
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:52,644
Okay. All right.

177
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:55,590
- You are on vacation?
- Yeah, we're backpacking.

178
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,236
Our next stop is Bratislava.

179
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:02,896
- What?
- Slovakia.

180
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:06,717
You will like it.

181
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:09,326
Casino, girls.

182
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,545
You can pay to do anything.

183
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,493
Anything.

184
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:20,541
- How are the girls?
- Very beautiful.

185
00:14:21,154 --> 00:14:24,067
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

186
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:29,752
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

187
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:33,810
That's... That's awkward.
That's awkward.

188
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,393
That's awkward too.

189
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,249
- You need a fork there, chief?
- No, no, no.

190
00:14:49,427 --> 00:14:51,962
I prefer to use my hands.

191
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:54,545
I believe...

192
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,702
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

193
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:01,449
They do not think:

194
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:05,297
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

195
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:09,388
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

196
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:10,963
I appreciate it more.

197
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,610
Well, I'm vegetarian.

198
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,256
And I am a meat-eater.

199
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,367
It's human nature.

200
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:21,510
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

201
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,230
Tell me, what is your nature?

202
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:28,516
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

203
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:30,585
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:33,474
Excuse me.

205
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,556
Fucking freak.

206
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,462
Jesus.

207
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,134
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

208
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:50,053
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

209
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,666
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

210
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,792
Or we could visit some factories.

211
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:02,610
Should be cool.

212
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,618
In this area...

213
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:09,335
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

214
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,655
Is that so?

215
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,908
Look at this.

216
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:24,074
- Nice, eh?
- This is a fucking hostel?

217
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:27,490
Holy shit.

218
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,572
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

219
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:42,598
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

220
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,513
- You are saved from boredom.
- Let me guess.

221
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:50,139
You must be
the King of the Swing.

222
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:52,545
You made a reservation under
"King of the Swing?"

223
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:54,489
- Yeah, of course, my horse.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:58,545
- He doesn't get out of his cage much.
- I can see that.

225
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,031
Here are your keys.

226
00:19:03,304 --> 00:19:06,148
You leave your passports
at the desk.

227
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:13,109
That was taken when I was like 13.
I was kind of husky.

228
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,657
Not anymore, though, you know?

229
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:17,808
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

230
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:22,156
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

231
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:25,243
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

232
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,689
Sorry.

233
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:38,267
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

234
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,389
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

235
00:19:43,903 --> 00:19:45,741
You should come.

236
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:51,367
Spa.

237
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,219
Jugs.

238
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:14,283
- Hey.
- Hello.

239
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:16,451
Oh, Jesus.

240
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:20,573
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

241
00:20:23,664 --> 00:20:25,606
How you doing?

242
00:20:28,656 --> 00:20:31,465
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

243
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,755
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

244
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:40,001
- You wanna see?
- No, no, no, you're not... I'm good.

245
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,452
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

246
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,876
- You're not from Iceland, no?
- No. Fuck, no. American.

247
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,752
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

248
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:52,567
Hygiene and... Am I talking?

249
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:55,510
- I'm Josh.
- Natalya.

250
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:57,957
- And this is Svetlana.
- Hi.

251
00:20:58,603 --> 00:21:00,304
Hi, I'm Paxton.

252
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:03,486
- And this is Oli.
- The King of the Swing.

253
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:06,269
Hello.

254
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:09,782
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

255
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,431
Jesus.

256
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,541
So where are you girls from?

257
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,983
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

258
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,225
Prague.

259
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:22,207
Prague's cool. Kafka.

260
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:25,861
So, Natalya...

261
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:28,675
- Yeah?
- You're Russian, eh?

262
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:53,966
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

263
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,996
- This is awesome.
- Yes.

264
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:43,851
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

265
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,429
...and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

266
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,985
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's... You know, it's cool.

267
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:52,593
It's okay.

268
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,292
Look, Vala is here.

269
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,976
- Who?
- Vala, from front desk. Vala.

270
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,069
- All right, Oli.
- Hey, I told you, man.

271
00:23:02,242 --> 00:23:04,343
I'm the King of the Swing.

272
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:07,869
Come, let's dance.

273
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:18,653
- Does the cigarette bother you?
- No, it's...

274
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,593
I put away.

275
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,039
It's fine, I...

276
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,124
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

277
00:23:26,393 --> 00:23:29,305
But I'll be back, okay?

278
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:52,917
Cigarette.

279
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:55,502
Cigarette.

280
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,238
Aren't you a little young?

281
00:23:57,412 --> 00:23:59,216
- Dollar.
- What?

282
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:01,125
Dollar.

283
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:08,761
- Dollar.
- Here you go.

284
00:24:16,606 --> 00:24:18,548
Here, children commit
the most crime.

285
00:24:18,984 --> 00:24:22,125
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

286
00:24:22,703 --> 00:24:25,341
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

287
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,828
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

288
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,545
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

289
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,095
Hey, Josh.

290
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,737
Faggot.

291
00:24:37,073 --> 00:24:39,551
Go with your friends. It's okay.

292
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,558
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

293
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:43,762
About the way I reacted.

294
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,943
We cool?

295
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:54,017
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

296
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:58,301
It's not easy...

297
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:01,152
...but from my experience...

298
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:04,672
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

299
00:25:07,053 --> 00:25:08,389
Now I have my little girl...

300
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:12,342
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

301
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:16,187
But you should do...

302
00:25:16,366 --> 00:25:18,741
...whatever's right for you.

303
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:23,993
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

304
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:41,652
Should we be doing this
with them there?

305
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:43,628
Yeah, it's okay.

306
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:49,388
- Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
- Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

307
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:52,040
- All right.
- Come on, big boy.

308
00:25:52,209 --> 00:25:54,618
- We go to spa.
- Spa.

309
00:25:54,788 --> 00:25:57,460
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

310
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:59,199
Bye.

311
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:27,034
Mission accomplished.

312
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:34,172
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

313
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:37,082
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

314
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,390
Be quiet.

315
00:27:43,252 --> 00:27:45,525
They're showering together.

316
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:50,819
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

317
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:54,605
I guess Oli's not back yet.

318
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,550
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

319
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,253
We'll see him at breakfast.

320
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:17,347
- What's the name?
- Oli Ericson, 237.

321
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,905
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

322
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,211
Fucking gay.

323
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:26,420
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

324
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:29,008
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

325
00:28:29,178 --> 00:28:31,553
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

326
00:28:32,494 --> 00:28:34,732
- When this morning?
- I don't know exact time.

327
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:37,075
I could find out tomorrow.

328
00:28:43,414 --> 00:28:46,327
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

329
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:48,437
Can I leave a note
in case he comes back?

330
00:28:48,606 --> 00:28:50,639
Okay, cool. Yeah.

331
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,462
All right.

332
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,038
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

333
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:05,015
Okay.

334
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:06,752
- We see you later, right?
- Yeah.

335
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:09,029
Okay.

336
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:11,344
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

337
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:16,200
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

338
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,043
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

339
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:21,428
- Hi! Hi! Hi!
- Hi.

340
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:23,303
Your friend.

341
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:27,654
- What the hell?
- Your friend, my friend.

342
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,704
What does that say?

343
00:29:30,746 --> 00:29:32,414
Sayonara. Your friend.

344
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:34,222
What, they left? Like, together?

345
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,310
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

346
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,077
I mean, no offense, but...

347
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,784
When did she send this to you?

348
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:43,098
This picture. Today?

349
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:46,589
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

350
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:47,751
This picture.

351
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:51,511
That water looks fucking cold.

352
00:29:51,682 --> 00:29:54,217
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

353
00:29:54,396 --> 00:29:56,839
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

354
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:59,818
- Where?
- Lake Michigan.

355
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:04,946
It was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

356
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:08,787
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

357
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:11,571
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

358
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:13,117
Yeah? What did you do?

359
00:30:13,287 --> 00:30:17,136
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

360
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:19,877
...and I yelled, you know,
"There's this girl drowning."

361
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:22,932
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

362
00:30:23,103 --> 00:30:27,146
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

363
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:29,931
It was that little girl's mother, dude.

364
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,044
Her kid was dead.

365
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:35,290
- Jesus.
- I had nightmares for years after that.

366
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:39,209
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

367
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:40,981
I just...

368
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,961
I just felt like I could have
done more.

369
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,738
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

370
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:48,153
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

371
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:51,970
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

372
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:54,315
What makes you think of this now?

373
00:30:58,509 --> 00:30:59,571
Bubble gum.

374
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:03,528
- Sorry, kid.
- No, no. Give him some.

375
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:09,057
What are you doing?

376
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,737
These fucking kids are dangerous.

377
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:14,989
Hey, Oli.

378
00:31:15,158 --> 00:31:17,362
- Hey, Oli.
- Hey.

379
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:21,923
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:25,403
- Hey, Oli. Hey!
- Oli!

381
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:32,237
It's your lucky day, Josh.

382
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,042
A museum.

383
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:21,345
How's it hanging?

384
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:26,268
- What the fuck?
- Holy shit.

385
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,416
- He got you.
- Yeah, that's hilarious.

386
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:29,817
Okay.

387
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,092
Hey, Oli.

388
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:35,511
Hey, Oli.

389
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:36,988
Hey, hey.

390
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:40,203
Excuse me?

391
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:44,152
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

392
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:46,967
Well, I'm not.

393
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:48,740
Where did you get that jacket?

394
00:32:51,161 --> 00:32:54,702
- Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
- Get your fucking hands off me.

395
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:59,024
This is my jacket.

396
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,846
It's from Oli.

397
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:19,321
"I go home"?

398
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:20,893
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

399
00:34:22,107 --> 00:34:24,551
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

400
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:29,171
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

401
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:31,914
Tomorrow, I go.

402
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:33,460
Okay, because we may go too.

403
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,445
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

404
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:41,167
Tomorrow, train?

405
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:43,002
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:34:45,757 --> 00:34:47,664
- Hello, Josh.
- Hey.

407
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:49,775
- Hey.
- Come, we go for disco?

408
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:53,656
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

409
00:34:56,074 --> 00:34:58,815
Okay, we'll see you.

410
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:08,327
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

411
00:35:08,502 --> 00:35:10,135
Okay.

412
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,122
- Josh, come here, dude.
- Yeah, what?

413
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:18,880
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

414
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:21,188
- I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
- I'm pissed too.

415
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:22,861
But we're not in America.

416
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,986
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

417
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:28,089
It's just how they do it over here.

418
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:31,177
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

419
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:33,254
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

420
00:35:33,424 --> 00:35:36,462
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

421
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,976
So let's look at our options.

422
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:41,424
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

423
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,943
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

424
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:48,930
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

425
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,201
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

426
00:35:51,378 --> 00:35:54,450
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

427
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:56,969
- It's his problem.
- All right.

428
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,275
All right.

429
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,763
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

430
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:04,699
You know, disco?
Dancing?

431
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:07,221
No?

432
00:36:48,324 --> 00:36:50,425
Josh?

433
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:53,376
- I'm gonna go back.
- Are you okay?

434
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,886
I'm, like... I'm tired.

435
00:36:55,057 --> 00:36:57,627
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

436
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:00,575
If you want, I will go with you.

437
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:05,264
No, no, no, I'll just see you
back at the room.

438
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:09,452
Goodbye.

439
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,615
Fucking pussy.

440
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:49,781
- Josh.
- Vala.

441
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,797
You don't look well.

442
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,208
- No, I...
- Here, let me help you.

443
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:57,453
I feel sick.

444
00:38:08,015 --> 00:38:10,893
Where is?
Where is Oli?

445
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:13,096
You need rest.

446
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,910
Where's the restroom?

447
00:38:43,556 --> 00:38:45,999
Past the bar, in the back.

448
00:38:53,036 --> 00:38:54,098
You guys cool?

449
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:57,219
- Vodka Red Bull.
- Vodka Red Bull, danke.

450
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,586
Yeah.

451
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:46,526
Hey!

452
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:49,441
Hey!

453
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:14,464
Open the door.

454
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:37,175
Oh, fuck.

455
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,335
What the f..?

456
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:04,476
Oh, fuck.

457
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:21,555
What? Who are you?

458
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:23,732
What the f..? Where the fuck am I?

459
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:26,386
What the fuck is this shit?

460
00:41:27,258 --> 00:41:29,462
Please, please...
Fuck. Please, please, please...

461
00:41:29,636 --> 00:41:31,875
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

462
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:35,898
Please, please, what the..?

463
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:39,517
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

464
00:41:39,686 --> 00:41:40,850
What the fuck?

465
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:43,699
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

466
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:46,375
What the fuck?

467
00:41:46,552 --> 00:41:50,595
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

468
00:41:50,773 --> 00:41:52,269
What the fuck is this?

469
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:54,286
What? No! No, please don't..!

470
00:41:54,457 --> 00:41:56,593
What the..?
No, no, fucking don't you... No, no!

471
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,448
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

472
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:01,592
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

473
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,033
Oh, please. What the fuck?

474
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:06,615
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

475
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,604
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

476
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,536
You.

477
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,840
Why?

478
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:06,910
I always wanted to be a surgeon...

479
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:10,325
...but the boards wouldn't pass me.

480
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:12,804
Can you guess why?

481
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:25,090
You see?

482
00:43:26,744 --> 00:43:28,983
So I went into business...

483
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,828
...but business is so boring.

484
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:36,614
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

485
00:43:36,793 --> 00:43:38,529
What kind of life is that?

486
00:43:39,238 --> 00:43:41,510
A surgeon...

487
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:45,429
...he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

488
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,334
Your life.

489
00:43:47,512 --> 00:43:49,990
He touches it.

490
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:53,999
He has a relationship with it.

491
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:56,880
He's part of it.

492
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:02,313
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

493
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:05,055
You want to go?

494
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:08,068
Is that what you want?

495
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,650
Oh, my God!

496
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:38,192
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

497
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,979
You are free to go.

498
00:45:15,845 --> 00:45:19,351
Oh, fuck. No!

499
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:22,601
No. No, fuck. No, fuck...

500
00:45:23,649 --> 00:45:26,322
Please, I have money.
I'll fucking pay you.

501
00:45:26,497 --> 00:45:28,369
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want...

502
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,945
- Pay me?
- Yes.

503
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:31,611
No one is paying me.

504
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:35,364
In fact, I am the one paying them.

505
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,837
Relax. Relax, bro.

506
00:45:49,276 --> 00:45:50,748
Oh, shit.

507
00:46:06,861 --> 00:46:09,100
- Two thirty-seven, please.
- Two three seven.

508
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,941
Didn't you check out?

509
00:46:12,254 --> 00:46:13,521
No, not yet.

510
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:15,426
Not yet.

511
00:46:15,604 --> 00:46:19,316
- This your bag?
- Yeah.

512
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,094
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

513
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,002
- I didn't check out.
- It says.

514
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,847
It happened this morning.

515
00:46:26,022 --> 00:46:28,157
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

516
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:30,400
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

517
00:46:30,912 --> 00:46:34,156
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake...

518
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:36,900
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

519
00:46:37,076 --> 00:46:40,456
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

520
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,667
Two three seven.

521
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:50,497
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

522
00:46:50,676 --> 00:46:53,783
No, think they left this morning.

523
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:55,455
Yeah.

524
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,050
I'm sorry, dude.

525
00:47:07,827 --> 00:47:10,237
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

526
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:14,324
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

527
00:47:14,493 --> 00:47:16,492
You will join us?

528
00:47:21,326 --> 00:47:23,302
You should come.

529
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:32,002
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

530
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,418
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

531
00:47:34,592 --> 00:47:36,225
I'm at the hostel.

532
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:40,777
Svetlana!

533
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:44,606
Svetlana!

534
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:16,657
Hey!

535
00:48:22,828 --> 00:48:24,027
You little fucker.

536
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,656
Jesus.

537
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:44,561
Wait at hostel for your friends.

538
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:47,236
They will look for you there
no matter what.

539
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:51,698
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who...

540
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,685
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

541
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,468
He's the responsible one.

542
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:01,640
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

543
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,852
...so he take them when he go out.

544
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:06,565
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

545
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:08,650
It is not uncommon.

546
00:49:11,466 --> 00:49:14,001
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

547
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:17,990
There's nothing right now.

548
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,633
We have his picture...

549
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:23,051
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

550
00:49:23,224 --> 00:49:25,999
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

551
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,645
Okay.

552
00:49:29,655 --> 00:49:31,128
Where are you from?

553
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,301
California.

554
00:49:35,249 --> 00:49:37,922
You are so far from home.

555
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:04,777
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

556
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:10,712
Hello, Mr. American.

557
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:15,371
- Did you get my messages?
- Which one?

558
00:51:15,809 --> 00:51:17,076
There are so many.

559
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,956
I call you back, but child answer.

560
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:21,904
Yeah, I know.

561
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:23,638
Have you seen Josh?

562
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:30,340
In English, please.

563
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:33,222
He is with your friend...

564
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:35,267
...the King of the Swing.

565
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:38,878
- He's with Oli.
- Why you leave last night?

566
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:43,342
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got locked in a storage room.

567
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:46,857
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

568
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:53,191
- What?
- She said you met another girl.

569
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,232
Where are my friends?

570
00:52:01,266 --> 00:52:03,299
The art show.

571
00:52:04,514 --> 00:52:07,084
- You mean like a museum?
- No, no, no.

572
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:13,586
Not museum.
They went... How you say, for artist?

573
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:16,797
- Exhibit.
- Exhibit for artist.

574
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:18,472
No, that doesn't make any sense.

575
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:20,318
Why? What is wrong?

576
00:52:20,493 --> 00:52:23,599
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

577
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:25,246
They tell us to tell you.

578
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,393
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

579
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,666
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have...

580
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:32,876
How you say, for electricity?

581
00:52:33,055 --> 00:52:36,035
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show...

582
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:37,836
...because I wanna go.

583
00:52:38,012 --> 00:52:39,850
- Have a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

584
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:42,191
All right? I wanna see some art.

585
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:45,039
Okay? So can we go?

586
00:52:57,843 --> 00:52:59,110
You're not going?

587
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:01,919
I've seen this show.

588
00:53:08,361 --> 00:53:10,360
You want gum?

589
00:53:11,074 --> 00:53:12,445
No.

590
00:53:34,724 --> 00:53:36,288
Too bad for you.

591
00:53:42,863 --> 00:53:44,028
We are here.

592
00:54:43,059 --> 00:54:45,194
Are you coming or what?

593
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:50,226
Excuse me. Excuse me.

594
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:51,898
How is it in there?

595
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:54,907
Be careful.

596
00:54:56,725 --> 00:54:58,061
Why is that?

597
00:54:58,802 --> 00:55:03,017
You could spend all your money...

598
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:05,092
...in there.

599
00:55:40,506 --> 00:55:41,739
How much is it?

600
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,016
For you, free.

601
00:56:01,376 --> 00:56:02,906
There.

602
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:06,061
That's the show?

603
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:09,874
Yes.

604
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:28,065
- What?
- Nothing.

605
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:33,129
You're so serious,
Mr. Serious American.

606
00:57:37,145 --> 00:57:39,212
You fucking whore.

607
00:57:40,729 --> 00:57:42,396
You fucking bitch.

608
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:44,708
You fucking bitch!

609
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:49,002
I get a lot of money for you...

610
00:57:49,171 --> 00:57:52,243
...and that make you my bitch.

611
00:57:54,932 --> 00:57:58,142
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

612
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:01,824
This is fucked!

613
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,233
Get the fuck off me!

614
00:58:03,976 --> 00:58:05,975
Get the fuck off me!

615
00:59:05,076 --> 00:59:06,515
Fuck.

616
00:59:36,262 --> 00:59:37,461
Talk.

617
00:59:40,918 --> 00:59:42,448
Talk. Speak.

618
00:59:43,765 --> 00:59:45,603
What the fuck
do you want me to say?

619
00:59:47,551 --> 00:59:49,253
American.

620
00:59:51,737 --> 00:59:53,142
No. No, wait!

621
00:59:53,313 --> 00:59:55,688
I'm not fucking American!

622
00:59:56,595 --> 00:59:59,771
I'm not fucking... Look at me.
I'm not fucking American.

623
01:00:00,615 --> 01:00:02,213
American.

624
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:07,782
Please, what the fuck is this?

625
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:16,492
Let me go. Please.

626
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,377
I promise I won't tell anybody.

627
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:24,087
Just please let me go.

628
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:52,458
Don't. Don't.

629
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:54,338
Please don't.

630
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:06,628
Don't, please.

631
01:01:09,586 --> 01:01:11,185
God.

632
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,518
Oh, please, stop!

633
01:01:45,697 --> 01:01:48,505
Please stop it. Please stop it.

634
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:52,288
I know you don't wanna do this.

635
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:53,936
Please don't do this.

636
01:06:12,002 --> 01:06:13,406
Fuck.

637
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:37,286
Oh, shit.

638
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,413
What the fuck?

639
01:13:44,419 --> 01:13:45,858
What do you think?

640
01:13:47,769 --> 01:13:49,333
How do I look?

641
01:13:49,511 --> 01:13:52,583
I feel like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

642
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,609
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

643
01:13:59,258 --> 01:14:02,262
Yeah. I'll tell you something...

644
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,415
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Wait a sec.

645
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:09,537
How was it?

646
01:14:13,997 --> 01:14:15,402
Good.

647
01:14:15,572 --> 01:14:18,918
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

648
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,395
What did you go for, a local?

649
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:22,801
What, European?

650
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:26,419
- American.
- An Amer..?

651
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:30,143
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
I fucking... I love it.

652
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:33,154
I just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

653
01:14:33,325 --> 01:14:35,358
They told me they lined up
something special.

654
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:37,638
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

655
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:39,583
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

656
01:14:39,757 --> 01:14:41,996
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

657
01:14:42,169 --> 01:14:46,851
It's like... They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

658
01:14:47,026 --> 01:14:48,555
Come here.

659
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:52,382
I've been all over the world.
You know, I've been everywhere.

660
01:14:52,553 --> 01:14:55,397
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

661
01:14:55,902 --> 01:14:59,683
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every...

662
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:01,523
It's all the same shit.

663
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:05,741
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the color of her tits.

664
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:11,671
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

665
01:15:13,456 --> 01:15:14,449
Right?

666
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,107
- Never.
- Never, right.

667
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:21,788
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

668
01:15:21,964 --> 01:15:24,945
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

669
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:29,164
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

670
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:31,499
I'll be out in a second, guy.

671
01:15:32,482 --> 01:15:35,896
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

672
01:15:37,272 --> 01:15:38,505
How'd you do it?

673
01:15:40,086 --> 01:15:41,388
Did you do it real slow...

674
01:15:41,995 --> 01:15:44,634
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

675
01:15:44,809 --> 01:15:46,579
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

676
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:48,853
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

677
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,628
I just wanted to get it over with.

678
01:15:50,805 --> 01:15:53,409
But now I'm thinking maybe
I wanna feel it, you know?

679
01:15:53,586 --> 01:15:55,219
I wanna fucking feel that shit.

680
01:15:55,395 --> 01:15:58,741
So I don't know what to... I'm thinking...
What do you think I should do?

681
01:16:02,094 --> 01:16:03,898
- Make it quick.
- Make it quick.

682
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:06,046
Yes.

683
01:16:06,717 --> 01:16:08,658
Yeah, that's... No, fuck that shit.

684
01:16:08,827 --> 01:16:12,105
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I'm going fucking old school.

685
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,978
Who wants this, motherfucker?

686
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,859
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

687
01:16:17,034 --> 01:16:18,736
Bring it.

688
01:17:47,343 --> 01:17:48,713
Hey, buddy.

689
01:17:48,884 --> 01:17:51,590
Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

690
01:17:54,478 --> 01:17:55,814
What are you, fucking deaf?

691
01:18:04,728 --> 01:18:06,030
Kana.

692
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:16,744
- Oh, my God.
- What do you want me to do, Kana?

693
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:23,981
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

694
01:18:30,186 --> 01:18:36,411
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

695
01:18:36,584 --> 01:18:40,901
- Fuck. Oh, God. God.
- No. No!

696
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,082
- Shit.
- No!

697
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,630
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
01:19:04,153 --> 01:19:05,455
Fuck!

699
01:19:05,627 --> 01:19:07,065
Fuck!

700
01:19:10,852 --> 01:19:12,588
Fuck!

701
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:31,543
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

702
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,270
Move this fucking truck!

703
01:23:01,817 --> 01:23:03,050
Fuck.

704
01:23:15,853 --> 01:23:17,349
We're almost there.

705
01:23:22,787 --> 01:23:24,020
Oh, my God.

706
01:23:27,443 --> 01:23:28,710
Oh, no.

707
01:23:33,272 --> 01:23:34,505
Fuck.

708
01:25:07,165 --> 01:25:09,666
Kana.

709
01:25:11,185 --> 01:25:12,989
Kana.

710
01:25:22,607 --> 01:25:24,583
Come here.

711
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:36,540
No. No, Kana. Kana.

712
01:25:40,898 --> 01:25:42,428
No, Kana.

713
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:41,922
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

714
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:45,770
I believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

715
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:46,978
They do not think:

716
01:26:47,155 --> 01:26:50,433
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

717
01:26:50,606 --> 01:26:55,220
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

718
01:28:40,946 --> 01:28:42,922
Oh, Jesus.

719
01:28:54,915 --> 01:28:55,943
Goddamn!

720
01:28:56,121 --> 01:28:58,063
Fucker.

721
01:29:28,915 --> 01:29:30,286
No, please!

722
01:33:25,340 --> 01:33:28,286
I get a lot of money for you...

723
01:33:28,456 --> 01:33:31,596
...and that make you my bitch.
