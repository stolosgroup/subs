<i>I am a journalist, Robert.</i>

3
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:36,371
<i>I have little interest in fancy.</i>

4
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,384
<i>You, Daniel Defoe, are a writer.</i>

5
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:42,377
<i>It is your destiny as such</i>
<i>to bring the man's story...</i>

6
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:47,382
<i>a story of struggle, friendship</i>
<i>and undying love to the world.</i>

7
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,395
Well done. Well done.

8
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:51,397
Full of life, death, passion.

9
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,399
You could indeed give up
publishing for the stage

10
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:58,393
Tell me, what relevance has this fine
story to a scribe like myself?

11
00:00:58,438 --> 00:01:02,340
Yes, Daniel, you are my
favorite impoverished scribe.

12
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,344
And what is this?

13
00:01:04,378 --> 00:01:08,337
A recently discovered journal
of one Robinson Crusoe.

14
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:12,341
-Then this tale is true.
-Every word.

15
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:20,360
The travel log of
a wayward seaman.

16
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,363
Read this journal.

17
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:29,358
I am confident you will find a great
interest in the story he has to tell.

18
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:42,371
<i>And so my story begins like so</i>
<i>many other stories, with a woman.</i>

19
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,375
<i>For as long as I can remember,</i>
<i>Mary McGregor and I planned to marry.</i>

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,389
<i>However, as the McGregor family</i>
<i>grew more prosperous...</i>

21
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:53,382
<i>so too did the fortunes of</i>
<i>the Crusoe family dwindle.</i>

22
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:57,386
<i>As a result, the woman</i>
<i>I loved was betrothed...</i>

23
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:01,333
<i>against her will to my dear</i>
<i>friend Patrick Connor.</i>

24
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:12,334
<i>Patrick knew of our bond, but he didn't</i>
<i>release Mary from their arrangement.</i>

25
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,338
-It need not end this way.
-How then?

26
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:23,345
Cease the engagement,
disgrace my family?

27
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,363
Patrick!

28
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:33,366
We were friends once.

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,368
Does that not count for something?

30
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:40,373
We were friends, Crusoe.

31
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,369
But we are friends no longer!

32
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,389
Then we shall fight.

33
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:56,371
She is to be my wife, Robin.
It is God's will.

34
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:00,318
You know Mary and I loved
each other since childhood.

35
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:03,322
-Patrick!
-This is not your fight, James!

36
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:07,326
You're not like your brothers.

37
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:12,331
Don't be like your brothers.

38
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,351
You will never be together!

39
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,360
Patrick!

40
00:04:44,397 --> 00:04:48,356
Dear God, forgive me.

41
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:07,320
He's dead, sir.

42
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,324
Murderer.

43
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,332
Take your horse, sir.

44
00:05:19,366 --> 00:05:22,335
-I'll not leave.
-Go now!

45
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,348
Murderer!

46
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,356
I told him I didn't love him.

47
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,359
-Yet he fought?
-You both fought.

48
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:57,352
What are you saying? Do you believe I'd
willfully kill my friend? I walked away.

49
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:02,300
-You accepted his challenge.
-Would a man known better than to fight?

50
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:07,295
-His brothers will seek vengeance.
-They have already.

51
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:10,309
He was my friend.

52
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:15,303
I would never have wished such
a terrible fate on him.

53
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:24,323
You must leave now. It is
not safe for you anymore.

54
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:29,317
-Will it ever be safe for me?
-Time will heal this wound.

55
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:33,321
I will explain to Patrick's Family.
They will come to understand.

56
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:37,325
Go with the coachman.
You can trust him.

57
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,329
He will take you to Edinburgh
and arrange your safe passage.

58
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:48,347
Come back wiser
for the experience.

59
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:52,340
In a year...
I'll return.

60
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,353
Then we shall be wed.

61
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:59,347
If it is thirteen months,
shall I marry another?

62
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,297
I love you.

63
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:09,301
I will always see your
face before me.

64
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:37,329
A year.

65
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:41,333
No longer

66
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:58,333
<i>And so I took to the seas. The one</i>
<i>place there I knew I would be safe.</i>

67
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:04,339
<i>For many months we sailed</i>
<i>the great oceans of the world.</i>

68
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:08,343
<i>We docked at mysterious scented</i>
<i>islands under the Southern Cross.</i>

69
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:12,347
<i>We swam with mermaids</i>
<i>and we carried fabulous cargos...</i>

70
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:15,361
<i>of silks and spices,</i>
<i>jade and mahogany.</i>

71
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:21,356
<i>Then once even we carried</i>
<i>a human cargo of slaves.</i>

72
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:29,364
<i>Providence had decreed me</i>
<i>a man without a country...</i>

73
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:32,378
<i>yet I was not without a purpose.</i>

74
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:36,371
<i>Though I had served in His Majesty's</i>
<i>army, it was my academic background...</i>

75
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,376
<i>and my intimate knowledge of history</i>
<i>that led the captain to call on me...</i>

76
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:45,380
<i>to chronicle our journey</i>
<i>through the written world.</i>

77
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:49,395
Enter.

78
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,399
Captain's compliments, Mr. Crusoe.

79
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,402
Thank you. Shut the door.

80
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:05,333
<i>Though Patrick's death</i>
<i>brought about my exile...</i>

81
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,346
<i>it was the thought of Mary...</i>

82
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,339
<i>that I would have her hand</i>
<i>in marriage upon my return...</i>

83
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:15,343
<i>that kept my spirits</i>
<i>strong as our voyage continued.</i>

84
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:24,352
<i>Our little ship had met and bested</i>
<i>foul weather on high seas...</i>

85
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:29,357
<i>in three oceans. Sometimes the</i>
<i>storms would last a week or more.</i>

86
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:34,362
<i>But I grew ever more confident in</i>
<i>the skills of our captain and crew.</i>

87
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,381
What do you see in the crow's nest?

88
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:55,383
-Batten down the hatches!
-Batten down the hatches!

89
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:57,396
Aye, aye, sir!

90
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:13,345
Over here!

91
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,368
We're going down!
We're going down!

92
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,389
Give me your hand!

93
00:12:57,423 --> 00:12:59,391
Give me your hand!

94
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,326
-Give it to me now!
-I can't!

95
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:32,346
-Help!
-We've run aground!

96
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:13,314
<i>As I took my first steps in that</i>
<i>unknown land, a dread came over me.</i>

97
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:18,319
<i>I began to realize</i>
<i>how terrible was my condition.</i>

98
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:30,342
Hello!

99
00:15:52,398 --> 00:15:54,366
<i>As I laid my companions to rest...</i>

100
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,359
<i>I confess my thoughts</i>
<i>were for my own soul.</i>

101
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:03,307
<i>I did not know in what land</i>
<i>I had been cast, in what country...</i>

102
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:08,302
<i>among what nation. Nor whether I</i>
<i>might endure a single night here...</i>

103
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:13,307
<i>let alone a week.</i>
<i>Or a month.</i>

104
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:21,315
<i>I spent the night not daring to</i>
<i>imagine what dangers might prowl...</i>

105
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,320
<i>or crawl beneath me. And sleepless</i>
<i>for thinking how I might survive...</i>

106
00:16:26,365 --> 00:16:30,324
<i>the next day without food</i>
<i>or weapons or human company.</i>

107
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,344
<i>But as the sun rose,</i>
<i>so did my spirits.</i>

108
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:45,339
<i>I saw the ship's hulk had caught</i>
<i>on the reef where she had foundered.</i>

109
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:49,343
<i>On board I might find food</i>
<i>and drink for my sustenance.</i>

110
00:16:49,388 --> 00:16:52,357
<i>And this gave me fresh hope.</i>

111
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:06,294
Hello!
Is anyone there?

112
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:50,338
<i>Our ship lay so on the reef that</i>
<i>only half was filled with water.</i>

113
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:55,343
<i>The forward parts were dry and</i>
<i>there I found powder and weapons...</i>

114
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:58,357
<i>and provisions.</i>

115
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:01,292
<i>I discovered the carpenter's chest.</i>

116
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:05,286
<i>Being a gentleman, I had</i>
<i>little experience with the tools.</i>

117
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:09,290
<i>Nevertheless, there and then,</i>
<i>I resolved I would learn.</i>

118
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:26,307
<i>The ship's longboat had been</i>
<i>dashed to pieces by the storm...</i>

119
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:30,311
<i>but I found the part</i>
<i>of an upper deck torn away.</i>

120
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,325
<i>I used this as a makeshift raft.</i>

121
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:41,322
<i>Thanks to an incoming</i>
<i>tide and a gentle breeze...</i>

122
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:45,326
<i>my modest craft took me</i>
<i>straightaway to shore.</i>

123
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:50,331
<i>I began to feel not a little</i>
<i>proud of my achievements... so far.</i>

124
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:58,350
<i>And so I reckoned my</i>
<i>fortunes were on the up.</i>

125
00:18:58,384 --> 00:19:02,286
<i>I had provisions for a month</i>
<i>or more, tools and good timber...</i>

126
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:06,280
<i>even good company in</i>
<i>the captain's old dog, Skipper.</i>

127
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,302
There you go, Skipper.

128
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:22,307
That's it. No more.

129
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:25,310
You find your own food.

130
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:34,308
<i>I was now making daily excursions</i>
<i>away from the shoreline.</i>

131
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:38,312
<i>Penetrating further and further</i>
<i>into the interior of my domain.</i>

132
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:43,317
<i>I knew only that we'd been sailing</i>
<i>some miles from the coast of Guinea.</i>

133
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:48,322
<i>And I had in mind the possibility that</i>
<i>my soil was connected to mainland...</i>

134
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:52,326
<i>where I may happen upon</i>
<i>some human civilization.</i>

135
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:19,364
I'm on an Island.

136
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:40,374
<i>In order to keep watch daily</i>
<i>for the first ship that would pass...</i>

137
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:44,378
<i>I resolved to situate myself</i>
<i>as near the coast as possible.</i>

138
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:50,384
<i>The weeks turned to months,</i>
<i>and still no sighting of a ship.</i>

139
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,388
<i>But I truly believed</i>
<i>it must come to pass.</i>

140
00:20:54,433 --> 00:21:00,338
<i>Some vessel I would sail by my</i>
<i>shore sooner rather than later.</i>

141
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,370
Skipper!

142
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:35,373
Be quiet! Quiet, Skipper!

143
00:21:42,414 --> 00:21:44,382
Oh, my God!

144
00:21:50,422 --> 00:21:53,391
Come back!

145
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:02,332
Come back! I'm here!
Come back!

146
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:05,337
Fire! Fire!

147
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:08,340
Come back, please!

148
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:10,342
Please!

149
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:32,346
<i>It was on that day I came to see I</i>
<i>must no longer rely upon chance...</i>

150
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:36,350
<i>or fate or divine intervention</i>
<i>for my survival.</i>

151
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:41,355
<i>But solely on my own efforts...</i>
<i>as a man.</i>

152
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:01,318
<i>And I found, as time went by...</i>

153
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:06,313
<i>I began to grow even</i>
<i>found of my island.</i>

154
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,330
<i>I have not been idle with</i>
<i>my time on the Island. Even so...</i>

155
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:26,344
<i>my thoughts continually turn</i>
<i>to the life I left behind.</i>

156
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,346
Skipper, come here.

157
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,349
What you'll hear is the
sweetest sound on heart.

158
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:34,352
The spirit of Scotland.

159
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,327
<i>Robin.</i>

160
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:50,350
<i>My thoughts of Mary inspired me.</i>
<i>I knew one day I would return.</i>

161
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:01,304
<i>I erected a monument</i>
<i>to mark my landing here.</i>

162
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,309
<i>Upon it, I've scrupulously</i>
<i>recorded the days of the week...</i>

163
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:09,303
<i>and the months as they pass</i>
<i>since my arrival on the island.</i>

164
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:36,341
One year, Skipper.

165
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,344
A whole year.

166
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:55,353
<i>How many fantasies</i>
<i>tormented my mind...</i>

167
00:27:55,387 --> 00:27:58,356
<i>as I made for the</i>
<i>security of my castle?</i>

168
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,291
<i>Fancying every bush and</i>
<i>tree stamp to be a man.</i>

169
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:06,286
<i>Afflicted with such terror that</i>
<i>I could imagine Satan...</i>

170
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:10,290
<i>had taken human shape and</i>
<i>left his print upon my shore.</i>

171
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:20,300
<i>From somewhere came sounds</i>
<i>I believed I'd never hear again.</i>

172
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:22,313
<i>Human voices, to be sure.</i>

173
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:27,307
<i>But voices unlike</i>
<i>I'd ever heard before.</i>

174
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,321
Stay!

175
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:32,323
Stay here!

176
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:04,342
Don't be afraid.

177
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:07,345
I'm your friend.

178
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:10,348
I'm your friend.

179
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,389
Give it to me.

180
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:53,391
Come on.

181
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,345
What are you doing?!

182
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,349
I saved your life back there!

183
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:22,353
I want to be your friend.

184
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,359
How can I make you understand?

185
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:30,361
Friend.

186
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:36,356
I... am... your... friend!

187
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:39,370
Food.

188
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:42,373
Food.

189
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:44,375
Food.

190
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:47,378
Here.

191
00:32:53,418 --> 00:32:55,386
Gift. Peace.

192
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:22,335
You want the gun? Oh, no.
That's very powerful.

193
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,340
If you try to take this, I will kill
you, and I don't want to kill you.

194
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:29,353
You're my friend.

195
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,355
Food.

196
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:33,357
Food.

197
00:34:01,353 --> 00:34:03,321
Stop!

198
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:07,325
Blasphemy.

199
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,329
Blasphemy.

200
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,335
Blasphemy.

201
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:22,329
<i>How could I have imagine</i>
<i>being a friend to this savage?</i>

202
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:25,343
<i>I saw now he was</i>
<i>from another world...</i>

203
00:34:25,377 --> 00:34:28,346
<i>one surely ruled by Satan.</i>

204
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,349
<i>I, Robinson Crusoe...</i>

205
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:35,342
<i>would guide and protect my</i>
<i>Kingdom against all evil.</i>

206
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:36,354
Skipper!

207
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:42,349
Prepare yourself! Seems we've a very
unfriendly heathen on the island!

208
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:48,355
<i>Little did this pagan know but his</i>
<i>adversary was trained as a soldier.</i>

209
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,360
<i>So he would be facing one skilled</i>
<i>in strategy and the military arts.</i>

210
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:12,312
<i>It is hard to describe my</i>
<i>conflict of emotions.</i>

211
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:16,316
<i>In all these two years, I'd longed for</i>
<i>the company of another human being.</i>

212
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:19,330
<i>And now we were enemies.</i>

213
00:35:19,364 --> 00:35:21,332
<i>Hunter and prey.</i>

214
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:27,327
<i>And he was out there</i>
<i>somewhere on my Island.</i>

215
00:36:24,362 --> 00:36:27,331
Stay away from me,
you black heathen bastard!

216
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:35,339
Leave it alone.

217
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:38,342
Leave the bloody thing Alone.
You hear me?!

218
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:43,336
That's it. Blow your
bloody brains out. Go on.

219
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,349
Give me the gun.

220
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,358
That's it.

221
00:36:56,394 --> 00:36:58,362
Give me the gun!

222
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:02,298
Give me the gun!

223
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:10,296
Come here, come here,
I'll give you this. Look, look.

224
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:28,325
Up. Up.

225
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,326
Easy.

226
00:37:45,376 --> 00:37:48,345
You understand danger?!

227
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:50,347
Death!

228
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:56,353
Who are you?

229
00:37:58,389 --> 00:38:01,290
What are you?!

230
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,299
Look.

231
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:16,300
<i>That he was a savage</i>
<i>was indisputable.</i>

232
00:39:16,334 --> 00:39:19,303
<i>And yet he seemed to be</i>
<i>a decent fellow at heart.</i>

233
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:23,296
<i>In time. I might even turn</i>
<i>him from his pagan ways.</i>

234
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:26,310
<i>Perhaps this was my mission.</i>

235
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:28,312
What's your name?

236
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,318
How about Hamish?

237
00:39:37,355 --> 00:39:39,323
I had a brother, Hamish.

238
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,329
What day is it? Thursday?

239
00:39:46,364 --> 00:39:49,333
No, it's Friday.

240
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,337
Friday?

241
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,341
Friday.

242
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,348
Friday.

243
00:40:04,382 --> 00:40:07,351
Friday, Master.

244
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:13,357
Master, Friday.

245
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,360
Master.

246
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:19,363
Friday.

247
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:23,367
Aye.

248
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,371
Friday.

249
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,374
Friday.

250
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:50,394
Sleep here.

251
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:53,397
You... sleep...

252
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:55,399
here.

253
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:19,356
Just till the morning.

254
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:30,367
Food.

255
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:13,343
Stay here.

256
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:21,351
Food.

257
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:30,360
Master.

258
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,367
Stay.

259
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,370
Stay, stay.

260
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,375
Come here.

261
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:12,325
<i>I had wronged this poor honest</i>
<i>savage, and I was sorry for it.</i>

262
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,329
<i>It became clear that I could not</i>
<i>have found a better creature...</i>

263
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:19,343
<i>to be subject to</i>
<i>my benevolent rule.</i>

264
00:43:19,377 --> 00:43:24,337
<i>At least, that is</i>
<i>how I saw it then.</i>

265
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:49,373
<i>Friday became constant</i>
<i>and diligent in his work...</i>

266
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:54,367
<i>and proved to know a great deal</i>
<i>about planting and harvesting crops.</i>

267
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:58,371
<i>Indeed, to my surprise,</i>
<i>he even begun to instruct me.</i>

268
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:02,318
<i>In time, I made it my mission</i>
<i>to teach Friday the King's English.</i>

269
00:44:02,353 --> 00:44:04,321
<i>After 6 months...</i>

270
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:08,314
<i>I was astonished he learned the</i>
<i>language with such proficiency.</i>

271
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:12,318
<i>Yet other aspects of</i>
<i>Friday's education...</i>

272
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:15,332
<i>proved more arduous.</i>

273
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,329
Friday, I'd like to
talk about God.

274
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:28,334
-God?
-Your maker. Your creator.

275
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,347
God.

276
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:34,340
He made everything.
He made you.

277
00:44:34,385 --> 00:44:37,354
-Pakia.
-Pakia?

278
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:46,363
-Pakia, God.
-Crocodile.

279
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:51,357
Before long time...
no land... only water.

280
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:55,361
-That's in Genesis.
-Pakia live in the water.

281
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,375
He make tingpopo.

282
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:02,311
-He make tingpop.
-He made the sun and the moon.

283
00:45:02,346 --> 00:45:06,305
Sun and moon marry.
They make baby. Man

284
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:09,319
Make all men. Make me.

285
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:13,312
No... God made you.

286
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:16,326
-Pakia.
-You can't worship a crocodile!

287
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,329
Why not?
Teeth of crocodile.

288
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:22,332
Does this crocodile...
this Pakia...

289
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:26,325
-tell you to eat human flesh?
-Make strong.

290
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,339
We eat fish, swim good.

291
00:45:29,373 --> 00:45:32,342
You eat lizard, climb good.

292
00:45:32,376 --> 00:45:35,345
You eat heart...
make strong!

293
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:39,338
This is pagan blasphemy!

294
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:43,342
The true God is greater
and more powerful.

295
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:47,357
The true God is love.

296
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:51,350
He teaches us to love our enemies.

297
00:45:52,396 --> 00:45:54,364
Pakia...

298
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:58,357
is not God.

299
00:46:00,337 --> 00:46:03,306
Show me God.

300
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:08,300
-I cannot show you God.
-I show you Pakia, you show God.

301
00:46:08,345 --> 00:46:10,313
You cannot see God.

302
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:13,316
He is in the spirit.
He's in the soul.

303
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:15,318
I see spirit in the trees.

304
00:46:15,352 --> 00:46:20,312
I see spirit in the trees
and animals. I see everywhere.

305
00:46:20,357 --> 00:46:24,316
Here... here is God!
Here is the living proof of God.

306
00:46:24,361 --> 00:46:28,320
His sacred word. This is
the living testament of His love.

307
00:46:28,365 --> 00:46:32,324
His wisdom.
His divine plan, here.

308
00:46:42,379 --> 00:46:46,338
-Where? I see no God.
-No, you fool, you must read it.

309
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:48,351
Look what you've done,
you heathen savage!

310
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:53,345
This blasphemy and your soul shall
be damned to eternal torments.

311
00:46:57,394 --> 00:46:59,362
I no like your God.

312
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:03,300
I no like you.

313
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:15,301
Forgive all who trespass against us.
Against you. Against you. oh, Lord.

314
00:47:22,353 --> 00:47:25,322
<i>I knew I should come to</i>
<i>regret my harsh words.</i>

315
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:29,315
<i>Whether Friday was the better</i>
<i>for our meeting, I do not know.</i>

316
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:35,321
<i>For I had good cause to thank</i>
<i>Providence for sending him to me.</i>

317
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:38,335
<i>And so. I'm alone again.</i>

318
00:47:38,369 --> 00:47:43,329
<i>I manage well enough without him.</i>
<i>I eat well. I live tolerably well.</i>

319
00:47:43,374 --> 00:47:47,333
<i>But I find I begin to miss</i>
<i>him as a companion.</i>

320
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:57,354
<i>It's been several weeks now.</i>

321
00:47:57,388 --> 00:48:00,289
<i>Our path cross from time to time.</i>

322
00:48:00,324 --> 00:48:04,283
<i>We do not speak,</i>
<i>we do not communicate.</i>

323
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:08,287
<i>In my history studies, I'd chronicled</i>
<i>the religious wars that plagued...</i>

324
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:11,301
<i>mankind since the</i>
<i>beginning of time.</i>

325
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:16,295
<i>How sad. I thought that</i>
<i>in this universe of two...</i>

326
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,309
<i>religion had now put</i>
<i>us at our own war.</i>

327
00:48:21,345 --> 00:48:24,314
<i>Yet something had to be done.</i>

328
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:54,344
Friday.

329
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:33,316
We can't carry on like this.

330
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:38,310
Two of us on the same island,
not talking, not sharing.

331
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:47,330
I'm sorry for
the things I said.

332
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,333
Everything I did.

333
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:54,337
I was angry.

334
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:57,340
I apologize.

335
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:03,346
I want you to come back.

336
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,359
Good fish. Eat.

337
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:35,367
-That's it. Come on now.
-That's it. Come on now.

338
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,382
<i>So now we were 3.</i>

339
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:44,376
<i>And I heard once again the sound</i>
<i>of human laughter... his and mine.</i>

340
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,389
Let's get the loser.

341
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:50,393
-That's it.
-I win.

342
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:52,395
-I win.
-Come on.

343
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,397
I win.

344
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:57,400
-I win.
-You've cheated.

345
00:50:57,434 --> 00:51:02,337
-Let's take the bigger one.
-I'm the winner!

346
00:51:04,375 --> 00:51:08,334
<i>I hadn't forgotten who it was that had</i>
<i>brought Friday to my island, nor...</i>

347
00:51:08,379 --> 00:51:13,339
<i>that they'd return. The Nimas were</i>
<i>the dominant tribe on Friday's Island.</i>

348
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:19,345
<i>And Friday had been offered by his own</i>
<i>people as a tribute to these savages.</i>

349
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,358
Sunguma. Power.

350
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:23,360
Gun powder.

351
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,363
This.

352
00:51:26,397 --> 00:51:30,356
This is what Nimas come for.
This dust makes them powerful.

353
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:32,369
Great warrior.

354
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:36,373
Then they will come back.

355
00:51:36,407 --> 00:51:39,376
<i>So I determined to</i>
<i>be ready for them.</i>

356
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,369
<i>Like hunters setting traps for</i>
<i>animals, we prepared our welcome.</i>

357
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:47,373
<i>I explained to Friday that</i>
<i>this white man's magic...</i>

358
00:51:47,418 --> 00:51:50,387
<i>would insure that our enemies</i>
<i>go to meet their god Pakia...</i>

359
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:53,390
<i>rather sooner than</i>
<i>they anticipated.</i>

360
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,351
Dear Lord...

361
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:34,346
I thank you for the time I shared
with this faithful creature.

362
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:41,364
He was my friend.

363
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:55,367
Does Skipper goes
to Crusoe's heaven?

364
00:53:57,414 --> 00:54:01,316
Dogs don't have souls, Friday.

365
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:04,320
Only people have mortal souls.

366
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:08,324
Only people go to heaven.

367
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:11,327
Too bad. Good dog.

368
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:22,327
Friday ask Pakia to
look after dog's spirit.

369
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:49,354
<i>The lessons of humility do not</i>
<i>come easily to a stubborn soul.</i>

370
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:54,359
<i>Once I had thought mine</i>
<i>was the only true path.</i>

371
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:57,373
<i>Now I was no longer sure.</i>

372
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:06,316
The Nimas will come back.

373
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:11,310
With new moon, many, many warriors
will come. Want your magic.

374
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:16,315
We can't fight them all. We could
build a boat, go to your island.

375
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:21,320
-We can't go there.
-Why not?

376
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:24,334
We cannot go.
Can never go.

377
00:55:24,368 --> 00:55:28,327
I am a dead man.
This island of dead people.

378
00:55:28,372 --> 00:55:31,341
Well, we will be
if we stay here.

379
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:34,344
We build boat.
You go to your island.

380
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:36,346
If only I could.

381
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:41,340
My island's on the other side of
the world. Many, many moons away.

382
00:55:41,385 --> 00:55:44,354
What name your island?

383
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:51,350
Britain.
Great Britain.

384
00:55:52,396 --> 00:55:54,364
<i>Britani.</i>

385
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,369
<i>Nua Britani.</i>

386
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,309
You know Britain?

387
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:10,302
Not so long.
One moon maybe.

388
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:16,319
You mean New Britain?

389
00:56:20,357 --> 00:56:23,326
Right name Uua-ma-tupiit.

390
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,319
White men call it Nua Britani.

391
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:30,333
You have seen white men?

392
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:33,336
My father told me about
white men long ago.

393
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,338
Not good.

394
00:56:35,372 --> 00:56:39,331
White man, he take much
everything. Not give back.

395
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:43,335
Take land, take people.
Tanga people.

396
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,349
Make people slave.

397
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:52,344
You not white man, Master.

398
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:55,358
You good man.

399
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:59,351
If your island is close to
New Britain, we could go there.

400
00:56:59,396 --> 00:57:00,294
I cannot.

401
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:05,290
-Don't ask me, Master.
-My name is not Master!

402
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:14,310
My name is Robinson Crusoe.

403
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,318
Crusoe, aye.

404
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:25,321
What name is Master?

405
00:57:27,357 --> 00:57:29,325
White man.

406
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:33,329
I am slave to you?

407
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:35,331
It was a mistake.

408
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:38,334
I'm not your slave!

409
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:43,328
No, you're not my slave. We are
friends and we can live as friends.

410
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:47,332
We can build a boat--
We can leave!

411
00:57:58,388 --> 00:58:02,290
You gave life,
I cannot kill you.

412
00:58:02,325 --> 00:58:06,284
-Better I go kill myself.
-Then stay on this island and die.

413
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:10,288
But I will build a boat!
And I will live!

414
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:21,299
<i>My stupid arrogance had lost me</i>
<i>my dear companion for a second time.</i>

415
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:24,313
<i>And I was alone again.</i>

416
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:28,317
<i>If what Friday said was true...</i>

417
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:32,310
<i>it was a month's travel</i>
<i>to New Britain...</i>

418
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:36,314
<i>one of his majesty's colonies</i>
<i>off the coast of New Guinea.</i>

419
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,319
<i>But my time was short. I had to</i>
<i>go before the next full moon.</i>

420
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:45,323
<i>The typhoon season</i>
<i>would soon be here.</i>

421
00:59:05,322 --> 00:59:09,281
<i>I knew I would have to leave</i>
<i>soon or miss my chance.</i>

422
00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:13,285
<i>If I had not already done so.</i>

423
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:20,292
<i>How I regretted</i>
<i>my thoughtless words.</i>

424
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:25,297
<i>The chances were that I would</i>
<i>never see my friend again.</i>

425
00:59:37,354 --> 00:59:40,323
I am not slave!

426
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:53,336
I know, Friday!

427
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:57,340
You're my friend!

428
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:15,358
I tell you my spirit name.

429
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:21,353
Only spirit, me and
Tanga big men know.

430
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,378
Why're you telling me this?

431
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:37,380
Crusoe gave life.

432
01:00:37,414 --> 01:00:40,383
Not say more.

433
01:00:45,422 --> 01:00:50,382
Give power of bird.
Fly safe to land.

434
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:14,350
Quickly.

435
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:29,354
<i>Fearing it might be a tempest as</i>
<i>violent as that which cast me on...</i>

436
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:33,358
<i>this islands, we brought our livestock</i>
<i>to what shelter we could devise.</i>

437
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:38,374
<i>We waited together</i>
<i>to brave the storm...</i>

438
01:01:38,408 --> 01:01:42,367
<i>which indeed proved more</i>
<i>fierce than any before.</i>

439
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:14,325
No time to build new boat.

440
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,338
Moon nearly big.

441
01:03:16,372 --> 01:03:19,341
Nimas come.
Many, many warriors.

442
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,343
There's no place to hide.

443
01:03:21,377 --> 01:03:24,346
We'll have to fight them.
We may die.

444
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:27,349
Dying not important.
All men die.

445
01:03:27,383 --> 01:03:31,342
What matters is how you die.

446
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:37,359
Then we'll die like warriors.

447
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,319
<i>At last full moon...</i>

448
01:04:03,353 --> 01:04:08,313
<i>I knew that several of the</i>
<i>Nimas had escaped our trap.</i>

449
01:04:08,358 --> 01:04:12,317
<i>So this time, the enemy</i>
<i>would know we were there.</i>

450
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:20,326
<i>Our only ally would be our ingenuity</i>
<i>and what gunpowder remained to us.</i>

451
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:07,305
Our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

452
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:13,311
Give us this day, our bread.

453
01:05:13,356 --> 01:05:17,315
Lead us not into temptations...
but deliver us from evil.

454
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:21,319
For thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, forever.

455
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:23,332
Amen.

456
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:57,328
<i>I do not know how long I had lain</i>
<i>there while Friday ministered to me.</i>

457
01:09:57,373 --> 01:10:00,342
<i>I felt little pain...</i>

458
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:05,336
<i>but a coldness spread</i>
<i>through every limb.</i>

459
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:09,351
I don't want to die here.

460
01:10:11,387 --> 01:10:15,346
You stay with me till...
Please?

461
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:20,362
Then go back to your people.

462
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:23,365
-Cannot go. Can never go.
-You must.

463
01:10:23,399 --> 01:10:26,368
Friday's dead man.

464
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:29,371
Cannot go back from here.

465
01:10:29,405 --> 01:10:33,364
I am dead to my people.

466
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:35,377
I am tanuang.

467
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:38,380
This island of dead men.

468
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:41,383
No one ever leave.

469
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:48,390
I don't want to die here.

470
01:10:55,431 --> 01:11:00,334
<i>As he was offered for sacrifice, Friday</i>
<i>was considered dead to his people.</i>

471
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:03,338
<i>In many ways,</i>
<i>a fate worse than death.</i>

472
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:07,331
<i>As he could never again be</i>
<i>accepted amongst his own tribe.</i>

473
01:11:07,376 --> 01:11:10,345
<i>Ironically, this dead man...</i>

474
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:14,338
<i>was my only chance for life.</i>

475
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:19,354
Friday.

476
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:22,357
Friday!

477
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:36,371
<i>Robin.</i>

478
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:40,375
<i>Robin!</i>

479
01:11:57,426 --> 01:11:59,394
You live.

480
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:02,329
Friday take care of you.

481
01:12:19,382 --> 01:12:23,341
Friday take you home.

482
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:49,378
<i>Having neither</i>
<i>the provisions, nor...</i>

483
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:54,372
<i>in my case, the sense to aim</i>
<i>our sails for New Britain...</i>

484
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:57,386
<i>Friday and I set out</i>
<i>for his nearby island.</i>

485
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,322
<i>While Friday believed his people</i>
<i>could cure me of my ills...</i>

486
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:05,316
<i>his fate was far less certain.</i>

487
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:20,342
<i>I could not count</i>
<i>the day we were on the sea.</i>

488
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:24,335
<i>With God's grace,</i>
<i>we encountered only fair winds.</i>

489
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:30,341
<i>And with Friday as our guide, we</i>
<i>sailed safely to his island home.</i>

490
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:45,360
Friday!

491
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:50,365
Friday!

492
01:15:10,352 --> 01:15:12,320
You be better.

493
01:15:12,354 --> 01:15:15,323
She use magic leaves.

494
01:15:22,364 --> 01:15:24,332
Your wife?

495
01:15:26,368 --> 01:15:31,328
Was my wife. She thinks
I dead when Nimas take me.

496
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:35,332
Not come back,
she marry a new man.

497
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:48,356
Am I an evil spirit?

498
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:52,349
They think you are
a slave trader.

499
01:15:52,394 --> 01:15:56,353
Many times white man come
and take many warriors,

500
01:15:56,398 --> 01:15:59,367
many young men for slave.

501
01:15:59,401 --> 01:16:02,302
Take my son.

502
01:16:03,339 --> 01:16:05,307
Oh, Friday.

503
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:11,302
They think I bring you here
to make them slaves.

504
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:22,313
If I'm an evil spirit,
why does she help me?

505
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:24,326
You sick man.

506
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:30,321
Not good to kill sick man.
Bad manner.

507
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:57,359
He prays to the gods.

508
01:16:58,394 --> 01:17:00,294
What are they saying?

509
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:04,299
We fight.
One of us die.

510
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:08,292
If I kill you,
I can stay.

511
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:12,296
-If you kill me, you can go.
-I cannot kill you.

512
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:14,309
I will not kill you.

513
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:16,311
I am a dead man.

514
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:21,305
No wife. No man child.
Is better to die like warrior.

515
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:14,302
I will not fight you!

516
01:18:14,336 --> 01:18:16,304
You must!

517
01:18:16,338 --> 01:18:19,307
Kill both of us!

518
01:19:30,345 --> 01:19:32,313
I can't do this!

519
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,339
Almighty God...

520
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:01,342
welcome me to paradise
if I am worthy!

521
01:20:03,378 --> 01:20:07,337
-Kill me and live.
-I cannot kill friend.

522
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:10,351
Do it.

523
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:14,355
Do it.

524
01:20:40,415 --> 01:20:43,384
Come on! Over here!

525
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:46,387
This way. Come on!

526
01:20:52,427 --> 01:20:57,387
Don't worry. These savages
can't harm you now!

527
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:26,350
<i>And so fate had saved her</i>
<i>harshest trick to last.</i>

528
01:21:26,395 --> 01:21:30,354
<i>Just as a duel had cause me</i>
<i>to flee my native land...</i>

529
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,359
<i>so too did the battle between</i>
<i>friends bring about my return.</i>

530
01:21:35,404 --> 01:21:40,364
<i>I was to owe my freedom to the</i>
<i>men who had killed my friend...</i>

531
01:21:40,409 --> 01:21:44,368
<i>who had ravaged his people</i>
<i>and his family.</i>

532
01:21:46,415 --> 01:21:52,376
<i>The slavers nursed me back to health</i>
<i>and then put me ashore at Lisbon.</i>

533
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:55,390
<i>There I was taken aboard</i>
<i>a merchant ship.</i>

534
01:21:55,424 --> 01:21:59,383
<i>Six years after</i>
<i>my departure from Scotland...</i>

535
01:21:59,428 --> 01:22:02,329
<i>I came home.</i>

536
01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:52,362
It was he who gave you
the journal.

537
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:54,375
Yes.

538
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:57,378
Robert, I must write this.

539
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:58,362
-You miss him, don't you?
-He saved my life.

540
01:24:58,407 --> 01:25:01,308
He brought you back to me.

541
01:25:04,346 --> 01:25:07,315
A wiser man?

542
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:13,321
Perhaps.

543
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:31,328
<i>So Mary and I settled down to</i>
<i>marriage and a family for our own.</i>

544
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:36,333
<i>We were blessed with happiness</i>
<i>and prosperity. But...</i>

545
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:41,338
<i>for the rest of my days, I would</i>
<i>think often and long of the man...</i>

546
01:25:41,383 --> 01:25:45,342
<i>who'd given me</i>
<i>the greatest gift of all:</i>

547
01:25:45,387 --> 01:25:50,347
<i>My life, when</i>
<i>I'd all but lost it.</i>

548
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:54,351
<i>And his friendship</i>
<i>until death.</i>

549
01:25:55,305 --> 01:26:55,604
