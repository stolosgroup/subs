3
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:15,661
Hi, D,
happy birthday.

4
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,562
I wish we could
celebrate it together,

5
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,599
but just a few more
months and your parole is done

6
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:23,002
and, hey, you can
put your past behind you.

7
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:27,106
You're going to
love Guardian Island.

8
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:29,307
The Pacific
Northwest is so beautiful.

9
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,645
I really think I've found
what I've been looking for.

10
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:35,280
Susan and Freddie say hi.

11
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:37,817
Your little brother,
Sean.

12
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:50,529
How are we doing today?

13
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:19,324
Hey, D,
Happy Thanksgiving.

14
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,927
It's damn cold
here on the island

15
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,527
and I'm trying to
finish these renovations

16
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:23,729
before the holidays.

17
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,399
I really think I'm in
over my head this time.

18
00:03:27,465 --> 00:03:29,534
I sure wish you were here.

19
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,536
I really could
use your help.

20
00:03:32,238 --> 00:03:33,405
Sean.

21
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,924
D,
I'm so sorry.

22
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,227
Sean's funeral
is December 8th.

23
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:56,629
I wanted you
to know. Susan.

24
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:11,043
Don't do it.

25
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:32,965
Clear!

26
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,039
Bedroom's clear.

27
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,407
Clear!

28
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:51,817
Got something.

29
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,488
Fucking hell.

30
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:01,894
Oh, Jesus,
he's warm.

31
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:04,096
Get him down.
Somebody call EMS.

32
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:11,637
Dr. Alderwood.

33
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,072
Looks like we lost him.

34
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,847
Sorry to keep you
waiting, I wasn't...

35
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:24,850
Dr. Alderwood,
Special Agent Shaughnessy, FBI.

36
00:05:27,853 --> 00:05:30,122
May I?
That's a really small badge.

37
00:05:31,657 --> 00:05:33,458
Special Agent,
do you feel special?

38
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:34,694
Do you
mind if I come in?

39
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,629
- Please, please.
- Thanks.

40
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:46,305
You have a patient who goes by
the name of D... Dylan Forrester.

41
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:47,505
Who's that now?

42
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,714
Dylan Forrester, the man
you prescribed these for.

43
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,716
Oh,
that D. Forrester.

44
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:59,352
Right,
that D. Forrester.

45
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,620
He's one of my most interesting,
most promising patients.

46
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:05,124
When was the last
time you spoke?

47
00:06:05,191 --> 00:06:06,759
Yesterday. Why?

48
00:06:07,592 --> 00:06:08,861
He broke his parole.

49
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:10,896
Do you know where he is?

50
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:13,432
Has he done something?

51
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,701
Well, if by something you mean
attempted murder, then yeah.

52
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:22,141
Attempted. Well,
that's progress in a strange kind of way.

53
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,276
Are you sure it
wasn't self-defense?

54
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,545
He beat a man into a coma and then
left him hanging in his bathroom.

55
00:06:28,546 --> 00:06:30,182
Like a towel.

56
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:35,788
I've been working...
Well, D and I have been working together

57
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:38,157
to help him put
his past behind him.

58
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:41,127
Yeah, well, he's not doing
a very good job of that.

59
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,429
There are signs of
torture on the victim.

60
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:49,567
Torture. It just doesn't seem the
kind of thing that he would do.

61
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,274
It was, uh... It was me who put D.
Forrester in prison

62
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,541
for murder,
eight years ago.

63
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,412
I'm quite clear on
what he's capable of.

64
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,647
You know
him better than I do.

65
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:04,016
- Perhaps you and I should have a session?
- No, no, I'm good.

66
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,751
- It's on the house.
- No, thanks.

67
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,056
D has paid his
debt to society.

68
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:12,925
I mean,
between aversion therapy

69
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:15,227
and my behavioral
modification techniques,

70
00:07:15,294 --> 00:07:18,664
he's got a full bag of tools
to reintegrate into society.

71
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:22,068
Live a
relatively normal life.

72
00:07:22,134 --> 00:07:23,335
A normal life?

73
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:26,705
There is a big
difference in what's normal

74
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:28,573
for D and everyone else.

75
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:32,645
Come on,
Dr. Alderwood. Hmm?

76
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,481
You know you're obligated
to contact the authorities

77
00:07:35,548 --> 00:07:39,251
if you suspect one of your patients
might do themselves or others harm.

78
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:41,987
Yes, I'm very aware
of my responsibilities.

79
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,590
I don't know where D is.

80
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:49,462
I'm sure you understand that
confidentiality is the basis

81
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:51,664
for trust here
and what we do.

82
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:54,533
D is a changed man. He's proven
that sufficiently time and again.

83
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,001
People don't change,
Doc.

84
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,903
I'm sorry
you feel that way.

85
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:01,907
Well, then unless you
have some kind of court order,

86
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,476
I feel I can
help you no further.

87
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:05,077
Right.

88
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,181
Here you go.

89
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:11,684
I will hunt him
down before he kills again.

90
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,652
I don't need a
court order to do that.

91
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,788
Huh. You
seem determined.

92
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:18,791
Obsessed even.

93
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,361
D is in a kinder,
healthier place.

94
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:24,463
I assure you,
he's not a threat.

95
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:51,357
- Shaughnessy.
- Spill it.

96
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,160
So D's younger brother,
Professor Sean Forrester,

97
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:56,395
is some
big-brain history scholar.

98
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:58,497
Suddenly quits his
job a year and a half ago

99
00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:01,433
and moves to some
remote island off Washington.

100
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,069
He's opening an inn.
Like a bed and breakfast.

101
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,838
Wagner,
cut to the chase.

102
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:07,940
He's dead.
The funeral is tomorrow.

103
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,808
Place called
Guardian Island.

104
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,111
Guardian Island.
Get me someone

105
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,746
in the
Washington State Police

106
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:16,081
and a plane and a boat.

107
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,217
You got it.

108
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:54,887
I'm gonna be heading
back to the mainland

109
00:09:54,954 --> 00:09:56,422
while there's
still some daylight.

110
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,830
Were you close
with the deceased?

111
00:10:06,298 --> 00:10:08,000
He was my brother.

112
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:54,046
Sharon,
I'm sorry for your loss.

113
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:14,333
The cook,
really?

114
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,771
- His name is Hugh.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hugh, your new shiny object.

115
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:20,472
- That is bullshit.
- Honestly, Jo, I think he's a little weird.

116
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,441
- I think he's trouble.
- Yeah?

117
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:24,076
- Yeah.
- I feel like you're just threatened

118
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:27,112
- because he's younger than you, aren't you?
- Are you kidding me, Jo?

119
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,547
I'm trying to
look out for you.

120
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:29,982
Oh? U-Um...

121
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:35,421
Hi.

122
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:41,927
D. D Forrester.

123
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:43,329
Sean's brother.

124
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:47,466
I'll put you in room 12.

125
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,572
We weren't sure
you were going to make it.

126
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,611
Oh,
um...

127
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,449
So they're all in
the back with Sean.

128
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:05,384
If you wanna join them, I can
take your stuff upstairs and...

129
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:07,219
- No.
- Okay.

130
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:09,321
I need to
use my room first.

131
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,924
Sure,
how about I show you up?

132
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,802
Here's your room.

133
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,002
Sorry it's a bit dark.

134
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:25,871
Sean wanted to
keep the steel shutters

135
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:27,906
from when it
was a navy base.

136
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,008
Here's your key.

137
00:12:48,127 --> 00:12:51,430
Okay, one, say,
"I'm sorry for your loss."

138
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,133
I'm...

139
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,669
I'm sorry for your loss.

140
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,339
Sorry for your loss.

141
00:13:02,307 --> 00:13:03,609
Two,
give hug.

142
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:16,488
Three... Oh, yeah. Is
there anything I can do to help?

143
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:21,160
Okay,
pat shoulder.

144
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:23,028
Pat shoulder. Here we go.

145
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:26,298
Pat shoulder.

146
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:01,600
Sean, you couldn't tell
that son of a bitch anything.

147
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:02,769
Am I right?

148
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:04,403
He already knew it.

149
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,674
History,
science, anthropology.

150
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,676
Brain like a
goddamn elephant.

151
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:12,077
Bring it down.

152
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:17,282
- Show some respect.
- Sure. Sure.

153
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:33,967
Mom,
I'm sorry for your loss.

154
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:35,167
Don't touch me!

155
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,605
You got a lot of
nerve coming here.

156
00:14:39,672 --> 00:14:43,743
The announcement said
said friends and family.

157
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,278
And which category do
you think you belong to?

158
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,884
I'm sorry?

159
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,385
You already said that.

160
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:55,655
Is there anything
else you want to say to me?

161
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,161
No.

162
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,666
Perfect.
That's just perfect.

163
00:15:48,007 --> 00:15:50,075
He fell
from a scaffolding.

164
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,211
Hugh over there found him.

165
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,486
You got my letter.

166
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:04,757
I didn't know if
you would come.

167
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:07,225
I'm really
glad you're here.

168
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:09,261
Sean always said
nice things about you.

169
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:12,665
Me?

170
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:15,233
Sean was the nice one.

171
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:19,237
I am so
sorry about Linda.

172
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,874
She's just upset.

173
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:25,177
Why is she upset?

174
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,348
Well...

175
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,352
because her son just died.

176
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:37,023
I thought it
was days ago.

177
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,159
Is there anything
that I can do to help?

178
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:47,366
Okay,
you just let me know, okay?

179
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,439
I'm
supposed to say that.

180
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,058
You were a little hard
on D back there.

181
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,458
Hard on him?

182
00:17:14,694 --> 00:17:17,496
On D? He
can't feel anything.

183
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,332
That's the whole problem.

184
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:24,737
You have no idea what
I've been through, Susan.

185
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:27,707
What that thing
has done to my family.

186
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,275
How many cops
came knocking on our door

187
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,177
in the middle of the night,
waking us up.

188
00:17:32,244 --> 00:17:33,913
Waking Sean up

189
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,480
while he was
studying so hard,

190
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,717
doing his best to be
good enough for two sons.

191
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:43,022
So if you don't mind, and with all
due respect to my daughter-in-law,

192
00:17:43,089 --> 00:17:45,457
just pour it and shut it.

193
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:48,895
Please.

194
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:14,486
To Sean.

195
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:28,034
Hey,
I'm Massey.

196
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:32,437
Massey, Sean's
friend from college.

197
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:35,273
- Yeah.
- Archaeologist.

198
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,912
You want a drink?
It's a wake after all.

199
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:40,947
No.

200
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,282
I don't drink anymore.

201
00:18:46,652 --> 00:18:47,586
Okay.

202
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:58,698
- Sean's brother, huh?
- Yup.

203
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:09,976
Yeah.

204
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:13,980
I'm at a friend's
wake. Guardian Island.

205
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,950
The FBI? No shit.

206
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:21,419
They sure it was him?

207
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,491
Huh.

208
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:28,460
Shoot me the details.

209
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:48,114
- Alderwood.
- Hey, it's me, D.

210
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,283
Oh. D,
how are you?

211
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:54,687
You said that reconnecting with my
family would be essential to my recovery.

212
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:56,555
Oh, yes, that's correct,
but you can't expect...

213
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,356
I just
saw my mother.

214
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:01,326
Oh. And how did that go?

215
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,930
She told me that
I should leave.

216
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,767
I'm so sorry,
D.

217
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:10,368
But that's an
understandable initial response.

218
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:12,238
It's gonna be
hard for a while.

219
00:20:12,305 --> 00:20:13,940
It's gonna
be hard for you.

220
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,642
Are you doing the exercises
we practiced, the breathing?

221
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:19,178
Yeah.

222
00:20:19,245 --> 00:20:22,281
Good. Remember all the
hard work we've put in.

223
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:26,484
And D, take those lithium pills
too, all right? Don't forget.

224
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:28,955
They'll help.

225
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,058
You may even start to
have feelings or emotions.

226
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

227
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:40,132
D...

228
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:47,006
is there anything
you need to tell me?

229
00:20:47,073 --> 00:20:49,141
Anything that may
have happened recently?

230
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,445
Mmm,
no.

231
00:20:55,882 --> 00:21:00,619
Okay. You're not the
same man you used to be, D.

232
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:02,989
You show them that,
all right?

233
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,030
Okay,
I will.

234
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,332
Good. Anything else?

235
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,700
No.

236
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:17,502
All right,
well, call me anytime.

237
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:19,906
Bye.

238
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:01,681
You're my uncle D,
aren't you?

239
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:03,548
You must be Freddie.

240
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:12,490
Grandma
says you're insane.

241
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,526
I'm not insane.

242
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:18,030
I have antisocial
personality disorder.

243
00:22:18,097 --> 00:22:20,032
What does that mean?

244
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:23,302
It means a pervasive
pattern of disregard for

245
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,704
and violation
of rights of others.

246
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,038
What does that mean?

247
00:22:26,105 --> 00:22:29,108
It means I don't
care how people feel.

248
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,509
- Oh.
- Ever.

249
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:36,215
I also don't have
the capacity to feel fear.

250
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:38,550
Neither of
which make me insane.

251
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:40,086
They don't?

252
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:44,890
No, I just see the world
a little differently.

253
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:47,259
Okay.

254
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,527
What do you have there?

255
00:22:49,594 --> 00:22:51,596
It's a submarine.

256
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:54,834
Me and my dad were
building it together before he...

257
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,968
Japanese.

258
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:07,512
Oh, shit,
that's him.

259
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:22,995
Sean always saw something
in D that wasn't there.

260
00:23:23,062 --> 00:23:25,731
Until today, I haven't
heard from him for years.

261
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:28,167
I know he went to jail.
I knew he got out. That's it.

262
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:32,805
- Yeah, your dad was a really smart guy.
- Yeah.

263
00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:36,842
- What did he tell you about this submarine?
- My dad said that...

264
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:40,913
Freddie, can you
go upstairs? Now, please.

265
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:44,884
- Bye, Uncle D.
- Bye, Freddie.

266
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:50,189
You don't belong here.

267
00:23:51,957 --> 00:23:53,259
I'm Sean's brother.

268
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:58,364
That's the
category I fit into... family.

269
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:01,267
You gave up the right to call
yourself family a long time ago.

270
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:15,548
I'm not the same person
that I was back then.

271
00:24:15,613 --> 00:24:18,117
I'm seeing a therapist now

272
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:21,754
and he's got me
doing breathing exercises.

273
00:24:22,922 --> 00:24:25,991
And I'm on medication.

274
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:28,593
That won't change
who you are, D.

275
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,529
Wh-Why not?

276
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,898
Because you're insane.

277
00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:39,338
Don't move. I'm sorry,
y'all.

278
00:24:39,405 --> 00:24:41,340
You're under arrest
for attempted murder.

279
00:24:43,709 --> 00:24:44,977
You know the routine.

280
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:47,612
Hands behind your back.

281
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,150
Hands behind
your back. Now!

282
00:25:00,593 --> 00:25:01,861
Spread 'em.

283
00:25:10,903 --> 00:25:13,172
The feds are on the way.

284
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,540
Let's go.

285
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,475
Move.

286
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,711
I'll hold him
down in the bunker.

287
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,049
Move!

288
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:44,170
Right here.

289
00:26:03,756 --> 00:26:06,358
Don't even think about it.

290
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,708
Go ahead and have a seat.

291
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,281
So who all'd you kill?

292
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:35,921
Oh, you'd have to be
a little more specific.

293
00:26:38,624 --> 00:26:40,960
You must
be pretty happy.

294
00:26:41,026 --> 00:26:45,064
The sheriff's got the psychopath
locked up in the bunker.

295
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,201
Every family has at least
one nut job. Right, Jo?

296
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:54,907
I'm taking the sheriff and
the psychopath some coffee.

297
00:26:57,644 --> 00:26:59,745
Hey, Jo...

298
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:09,154
I knew Sean.

299
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:10,489
We go way back.

300
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:16,395
And not once did he
ever mention having a brother.

301
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:21,066
A murderer?

302
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:30,342
We was just on
the phone talking,

303
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:33,812
and he kept saying to
me he wants me to come here

304
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:34,980
and see him.

305
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:42,521
He said that he wanted
to talk to me about something.

306
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,128
Now he's dead
and you're here.

307
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:52,498
It's a little strange,
don't you think?

308
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:59,571
What is that?

309
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:01,106
I need to take my pills.

310
00:28:08,947 --> 00:28:10,849
I,
uh...

311
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:14,053
I can't reach 'em.

312
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:18,557
They're in
my front pocket.

313
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:27,166
You see my finger?

314
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,906
Step in.

315
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:41,413
Don't budge. Be smart.

316
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:56,428
What are these?

317
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,263
Depressants.

318
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,101
Help me
control my impulses,

319
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:04,903
deaden my
response to stimuli.

320
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,607
They make me more normal.

321
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:23,422
Open up.

322
00:29:58,357 --> 00:30:01,059
Thought you might like
something to warm you up.

323
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:10,369
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

324
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:17,710
Would you
like some coffee?

325
00:30:17,777 --> 00:30:19,044
No.

326
00:30:20,045 --> 00:30:21,246
Thank you.

327
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:24,950
Well, if you
change your mind...

328
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:41,133
Huh.

329
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:46,572
I didn't expect the FBI
to be here so soon.

330
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:49,374
I'm gonna leave this big
boy on the table right here

331
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:52,110
if he gets crazy.

332
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,261
Good evening,
fellas.

333
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:14,366
I didn't expect to
see y'all out here tonight.

334
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:20,405
Sheriff, what are you
doing all the way out here?

335
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:22,574
We got the call.

336
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:26,779
We came out.
We handled it.

337
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,480
You handled it.

338
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:31,517
Okay, well,
we'll see about that.

339
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:38,758
Why so many of you guys
for one dude?

340
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,927
You're in charge?

341
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:42,160
No.

342
00:31:57,543 --> 00:32:01,446
What field office
are you boys with, huh?

343
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,688
You can't be the FBI.

344
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:12,659
Not exactly.

345
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,563
What was that?

346
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,064
Nine millimeter.

347
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:25,705
What was that?

348
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:35,280
Um, w-we should
do something, right?

349
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,332
- Get the gun.
- What?

350
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:54,867
You can trust me.

351
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:59,605
- Or you can shoot me.
- What?

352
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:44,616
Sniper,
to the lighthouse.

353
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:48,387
We search the house first,
then fan out.

354
00:33:48,453 --> 00:33:51,124
And Pike,
recon the island.

355
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:53,826
Whymper,
look in there.

356
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:26,826
- Lock it down.
- Yep.

357
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,664
Hey,
hey.

358
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:34,067
Who the hell
are you people?

359
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:35,600
Where's the sheriff?

360
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:49,281
I know who you guys are
looking for, all right?

361
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:53,285
He's down the hill. He's
in the bunker with the sheriff.

362
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:57,190
Well, well, well,
what have we here?

363
00:34:57,255 --> 00:34:58,791
Don't move.

364
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:01,393
Really, does it look
like I'm going anywhere?

365
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,196
Cell phones.

366
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,665
Now,
you all heard the boss.

367
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:09,102
Every one of you is
gonna put your cell phone

368
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:11,436
in my lovely
little bag here.

369
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:13,605
Mercy,
please.

370
00:35:14,306 --> 00:35:15,407
Thank you.

371
00:35:15,474 --> 00:35:16,676
Listen to me,
man.

372
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:18,610
I just told you
where he was.

373
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:26,652
Hey,
cell phone.

374
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:33,860
- Hands.
- Cell phone.

375
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:38,664
Hey, I got
a pretty young thing

376
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,599
locked up in a
little cage down here.

377
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:42,367
Don't call me that.

378
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:46,706
No one dies until we
find out what they know.

379
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,573
Copy that.

380
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:54,647
Hey, we're good.
Rest of them looks clear.

381
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:01,821
I've been thinking,

382
00:36:03,388 --> 00:36:05,457
why did that guy
ask if we were the feds?

383
00:36:05,524 --> 00:36:08,560
Because the FBI are on
their way here right now.

384
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:18,738
Plan stays the same.

385
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:22,842
Now, why would anybody
lock you in a cage?

386
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:25,745
I'm not sure. Why don't we
open the door and find out?

387
00:36:39,558 --> 00:36:41,526
What did you do?

388
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:44,997
I knocked him out.

389
00:36:51,304 --> 00:36:52,604
Wait,
you didn't kill him?

390
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:55,708
No. I don't kill
people anymore.

391
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:59,245
Well,
shouldn't we?

392
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:01,047
He's a bad guy,
right?

393
00:37:03,282 --> 00:37:05,051
- Up to you.
- What?

394
00:37:09,322 --> 00:37:10,823
Asshole. Jeez.

395
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:26,772
Please, let me kill him.
Please.

396
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:30,142
Whymper,
status.

397
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,749
Okay, go find out what's
going on with him. Go. Go.

398
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:41,921
Blanchard,
hey! Upstairs, no surprises.

399
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:42,989
All right.

400
00:37:44,223 --> 00:37:45,958
How was your flight?

401
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,559
Being a canned sardine.

402
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,461
If the weather holds,
I should get to the coast

403
00:37:49,527 --> 00:37:51,463
in about three hours.
Any word from the sheriff?

404
00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:53,833
Nothing yet,
and no answer at the inn.

405
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,902
- Goes straight to voice mail.
- Keep trying.

406
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,104
How's our
friend from the shower?

407
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,537
Still in a coma.

408
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,473
It doesn't add up.

409
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:03,342
D knew that
removing his ankle bracelet

410
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,044
would trigger a response.

411
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:08,314
In all my years of tracking D,
he never left a body or a witness.

412
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:11,751
So why leave this guy
alive in his own apartment?

413
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:13,585
Why?

414
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:22,962
Hi,
Sean.

415
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,034
Where is it,
huh?

416
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:37,209
You really fucked up,
didn't you?

417
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,444
I had to.

418
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:41,479
He was onto me.

419
00:38:41,546 --> 00:38:43,983
We'll talk
about this later.

420
00:38:54,526 --> 00:38:57,163
Felix,
what's taking so long?

421
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:00,967
Run, Hughie!
Run fast, you little prick!

422
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:03,501
Run!

423
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,147
Fuck!

424
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,988
Hugh, stop,
you fucking coward!

425
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,859
Hugh,
stop!

426
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:28,094
Come on!

427
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:30,896
Take him.

428
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:38,637
Oh,
my God!

429
00:39:42,375 --> 00:39:43,508
They killed Hugh.

430
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:45,577
They fucking killed him.

431
00:39:45,644 --> 00:39:46,846
They'll kill you too.

432
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,656
It's okay.
Go sit. It's okay.

433
00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:02,261
Come on. Come on.

434
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:15,674
So now do you understand what
happens when you don't help me?

435
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:19,645
I hope that makes
things a little bit clearer.

436
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,587
Hey,
buddy boy.

437
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:50,810
Whymper!
Holy shit, what happened?

438
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:56,882
What in the hell are you
doing in here by yourself?

439
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:59,852
Hey, we got a situation
in the bunker.

440
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:02,922
Jesus Christ, someone
fucked up Whymper real bad.

441
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:06,624
Blanchard,
get down here now.

442
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:10,229
Get down here!

443
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,639
So there are three guys and it
looks like they have a lot of guns.

444
00:41:20,706 --> 00:41:24,009
- Shut up.
- Are you ever nice?

445
00:41:26,946 --> 00:41:28,914
- Freddie!
- Mom!

446
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,389
You watch 'em.

447
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:40,960
You're gonna come with me.

448
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:47,166
Oh,
but wait for me.

449
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,300
Where are you going?

450
00:42:00,646 --> 00:42:02,815
What did you do,
you idiot?

451
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:19,198
You know, there is
so much about you

452
00:42:19,265 --> 00:42:20,900
that I don't like.

453
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:23,669
Just thought
I'd tell you that.

454
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,873
Shut the fuck up.

455
00:42:42,388 --> 00:42:44,723
Do not move!

456
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:46,458
What now?

457
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,764
Fuck!

458
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:53,866
Hey!

459
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:08,080
Now, what is a pretty lady like
you doing with a shotgun? Hmm?

460
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:10,883
My name...

461
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,820
- You cut me.
- I needed a scream.

462
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:18,724
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

463
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:26,865
Goddamn. This is bullshit.

464
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,378
Fuck.

465
00:43:41,046 --> 00:43:42,281
He's here.

466
00:43:47,786 --> 00:43:50,256
My man didn't get it done.

467
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:56,095
Of course, he's here.
It's his brother's funeral.

468
00:43:57,863 --> 00:43:59,365
Guy's a psychopath,
man.

469
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:03,936
You remember
Lansing and Harvey? Bogotá?

470
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,106
Fucking Missoula.

471
00:44:07,172 --> 00:44:10,042
He killed everyone
while we just watched.

472
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:11,877
The guy's
fucking dangerous.

473
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:13,846
Here's what I
don't get though.

474
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:17,783
Why didn't he finish off
Whymper when he had the chance?

475
00:44:18,817 --> 00:44:20,586
Prison make him soft?

476
00:44:20,654 --> 00:44:23,088
No, it's more like a tiger
trying to change its stripes.

477
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:26,425
Hey, hey, you okay?

478
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:27,893
Yeah, it hurts boss.

479
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,497
Oh,
it hurts. Oh. It fucking hurts.

480
00:44:33,532 --> 00:44:37,002
- What the fuck.
- That felt good.

481
00:44:38,304 --> 00:44:40,139
Let's get to
work. Come on.

482
00:44:40,205 --> 00:44:42,908
- He's in a mood.
- Let's go!

483
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:48,247
Pike,
let's move!

484
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:57,356
All right, whoever kills D
gets Whymper's cut. Good?

485
00:44:57,423 --> 00:44:58,424
- Good.
- Good.

486
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:02,662
Uncle D!

487
00:45:02,729 --> 00:45:03,862
Those steel shutters.

488
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:06,498
How do you
close this place down?

489
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:08,400
The lever
behind the lamp.

490
00:45:18,077 --> 00:45:19,611
The
shutters are all closing.

491
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:23,982
Hey, Blanchard's
still in there.

492
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:26,753
Well, then Blanchard's
in deep shit.

493
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,986
Blanchard?

494
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:32,991
Find me a way back in.

495
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:42,067
- What happened? Are you okay?
- Yeah, he cut me.

496
00:45:46,338 --> 00:45:48,842
You bring this here now
during Sean's funeral?

497
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:49,875
Wait,
they're here for you?

498
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:52,544
They're not here for me.

499
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:55,614
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, right, right. This is just a coincidence.

500
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:58,183
We need phones.

501
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:00,552
Any of these work?

502
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:04,456
I'm really
struggling here.

503
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:06,726
- Yeah.
- It's so hard not to

504
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,193
fall back into old habits.

505
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,461
Well, yeah,
I know.

506
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:11,631
I know it's hard.
I know it is, D.

507
00:46:11,698 --> 00:46:14,466
You're not the only one to have
trouble with that, believe me.

508
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:17,035
I wanna do some of
those things so bad.

509
00:46:17,102 --> 00:46:20,439
No! D,
you're different, okay?

510
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:23,509
It's an act of will.

511
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,845
Use those new pathways
of behavior we've created

512
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:27,546
in your brain.

513
00:46:27,613 --> 00:46:32,951
But what if there are things
that, um, I need to do

514
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:35,655
to protect myself?

515
00:46:35,722 --> 00:46:37,222
Mmm.

516
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:38,892
Well, now, that's your
animal brain kicking in.

517
00:46:38,957 --> 00:46:40,526
Flight or fight,
you know.

518
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:43,262
But just stop, count to 10,
count to 100 if you need to,

519
00:46:43,328 --> 00:46:45,097
and ask yourself
this simple question...

520
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:48,534
These things you
feel you need to do,

521
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,805
are they things you
think you'll be proud of later?

522
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:53,472
Well...

523
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:55,441
probably not.

524
00:46:57,543 --> 00:47:00,446
Well, then you
probably shouldn't do 'em.

525
00:47:03,215 --> 00:47:06,452
Okay,
I'll consider that.

526
00:47:06,518 --> 00:47:08,387
Well, call me anytime.

527
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:13,225
These pills,
they make my hand shake

528
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,327
when they
start to wear off.

529
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:20,165
Why are you here?

530
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:23,502
Fuck you.

531
00:47:24,603 --> 00:47:29,074
All right,
man.

532
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:32,946
You know how much I'd
love to cut your eyes out

533
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:34,246
and feed them to you?

534
00:47:38,685 --> 00:47:42,154
I don't... I don't do that kind of
thing anymore though, Blanchard.

535
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:01,273
What'd you do to him?

536
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:03,810
We spoke.
It was disappointing.

537
00:48:03,877 --> 00:48:05,344
Oh,
my God, you killed him?

538
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,279
- Watch the doors.
- Yeah, I'm watching the door.

539
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:09,448
I'm watching you too,
motherfucker.

540
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:13,252
What are you gonna do, huh,
huh? You gonna go after 'em?

541
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:17,456
No. There's four
of 'em out there.

542
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:19,591
Oh, I thought you'd
killed two of 'em.

543
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,728
I didn't
kill any of 'em.

544
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:24,329
That's enough. I want you out of
this house and off this island.

545
00:48:24,396 --> 00:48:25,798
Get out and take
those people with you.

546
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:27,099
Linda,
he saved us.

547
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:28,968
No, no, no,
he saved himself.

548
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:31,804
That's the only person he cares
about and it always has been.

549
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:34,974
We wouldn't even be in
danger if it wasn't for him.

550
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,508
Isn't that right,
D?

551
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,712
- Maybe.
- What'd you do, huh?

552
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:41,915
Piss someone off?
Steal something?

553
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:44,550
Maybe you
killed the wrong guy?

554
00:48:44,616 --> 00:48:46,318
No.

555
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,387
Did you really
kill people, Uncle D?

556
00:48:51,623 --> 00:48:54,226
- They were really bad people.
- Freddie.

557
00:48:55,929 --> 00:49:00,065
Guardian Island.
They should call this place Murder Island.

558
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:28,594
Shoot the bastard!

559
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:33,565
Just shoot them already!

560
00:49:37,536 --> 00:49:40,807
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my eye!

561
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:42,474
He shot my
fucking eye out.

562
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:46,144
I think I got him.
I think I got him.

563
00:49:50,549 --> 00:49:52,517
Shoot the one
with the shotgun.

564
00:49:57,023 --> 00:49:58,858
I can't see
into the house.

565
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:01,326
Then shoot through
the fucking wall!

566
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:11,203
The whole thing's
armor-plated.

567
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:19,444
Now we
know he's watching.

568
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:22,381
They're gonna get
in here eventually.

569
00:50:22,447 --> 00:50:23,883
They're just testing us.

570
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,653
They're looking
for you, not us.

571
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:29,588
I want you to leave,
now,

572
00:50:29,656 --> 00:50:31,623
before you
cause any more damage.

573
00:50:32,524 --> 00:50:33,693
Go.

574
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,666
Okay.

575
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:42,367
Okay.

576
00:50:47,439 --> 00:50:50,375
Turns out Sean,
D's dearly departed brother,

577
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:52,645
had racked up
some pretty sizeable debt

578
00:50:52,712 --> 00:50:54,647
for a history
professor in recent years.

579
00:50:54,714 --> 00:50:57,549
But not so much debt
that he couldn't buy an island.

580
00:50:58,316 --> 00:50:59,819
The plot thickens.

581
00:50:59,886 --> 00:51:02,789
It used to be a navy base
back in World War II.

582
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,289
It gets weirder.

583
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:06,191
He bought it for
almost twice the market value

584
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:08,627
with the help of a
mysterious wire transfer.

585
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:11,463
Wow. Must be
some special island.

586
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,800
Seems like being
insane runs in that family.

587
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,968
Find out who that mysterious
benefactor is, will you?

588
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:18,336
- I'm on it.
- All right, later.

589
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:21,908
This is your best bet.

590
00:51:23,109 --> 00:51:26,578
How did Sean die,
exactly?

591
00:51:26,646 --> 00:51:29,882
He was restoring
the lighthouse.

592
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,151
He worked on it every day
until dark. That's when he fell.

593
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,721
He was working on the
lighthouse when he died.

594
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:36,856
I kept telling him
just to hire someone.

595
00:51:38,256 --> 00:51:40,159
He was so stubborn.

596
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:42,662
Hugh went out to take him dinner.
That's when he found him.

597
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:45,965
How long had Hugh
been working here?

598
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,234
Just over a month.

599
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,236
Why?

600
00:51:51,938 --> 00:51:52,939
Just curious.

601
00:51:56,843 --> 00:52:00,312
Okay, follow the trail
behind the inn.

602
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:01,647
It sweeps around the trees

603
00:52:01,714 --> 00:52:03,348
and leads about a
half a mile down shore.

604
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:10,288
D, I think you're
doing the best that you can.

605
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:36,716
He's gone.

606
00:52:38,718 --> 00:52:40,186
Good.

607
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:42,922
How are they
gonna know that?

608
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:45,557
Yeah, seriously, how are
they gonna know he's gone?

609
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,796
We'll have to tell 'em.

610
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:57,637
Get that machine off the boat.
Start searching near the inn.

611
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:01,707
We need to get
back inside that building.

612
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:56,762
Hold.

613
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:02,635
Sniper,
you read that?

614
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:12,044
It says D is gone.

615
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:20,552
The boat.

616
00:55:11,737 --> 00:55:12,939
Shit.

617
00:55:16,943 --> 00:55:19,477
Well,
we still got the other boat.

618
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,883
Try not to lose that one,
you fucking moron.

619
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:26,551
Copy that.

620
00:55:26,618 --> 00:55:28,453
Sniper,
my ass.

621
00:55:29,388 --> 00:55:31,223
You keep an eye out
of those windows, Cyclops.

622
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:35,061
I got nothing,
just rocks.

623
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,767
Hello?

624
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:45,871
Dr. Alderwood,
hey, it's me, D.

625
00:55:45,938 --> 00:55:47,807
Oh, D,
are you okay?

626
00:55:47,873 --> 00:55:50,443
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
- Oh, good.

627
00:55:50,508 --> 00:55:52,345
You're still
with your family?

628
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:53,879
Yeah,
yeah, I'm still here.

629
00:55:55,281 --> 00:55:58,884
I was gonna leave and then,
well, they needed my help

630
00:55:58,951 --> 00:56:01,821
and they're
still my family, so...

631
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,588
Oh, good for you, D.
Good for you.

632
00:56:03,656 --> 00:56:05,257
You stick with it.

633
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:08,493
It's just that trying to
do my best here and I...

634
00:56:09,795 --> 00:56:11,697
Don't be too hard on
yourself. Nobody's perfect.

635
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:13,032
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

636
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:14,599
Yeah,
I know.

637
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:19,205
I'm a little afraid it
could get a little messy

638
00:56:19,271 --> 00:56:20,639
when I get back inside.

639
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:22,475
I just still got
a lot to deal with.

640
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,311
Oh, is there a way you could
deal with one problem at a time?

641
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:27,413
Just one at a time,
instead of all of them

642
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,849
at the same time
like we talked about.

643
00:56:40,426 --> 00:56:43,029
Yeah, yeah,
I could do that.

644
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,332
Usually easier that way.

645
00:56:46,399 --> 00:56:47,967
Yeah,
it is.

646
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:51,670
Yeah. You're the D we
need you to be, all right?

647
00:56:52,738 --> 00:56:54,106
Keep at it,
son.

648
00:56:55,341 --> 00:56:56,608
Thanks for the advice.

649
00:56:56,675 --> 00:56:59,011
Okay, good, call me
whenever you need.

650
00:56:59,078 --> 00:57:01,247
Oh, for God's sake,
don't kill anybody.

651
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:26,739
I can't see shit.

652
00:57:26,806 --> 00:57:29,842
All right, let's
try the other side.

653
00:57:38,284 --> 00:57:40,986
Oh, my God, that guy
with the big teeth

654
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:42,655
is just
standing out there.

655
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:46,092
Hello! Can you guys
hear me in there?

656
00:57:47,726 --> 00:57:50,696
- Yeah, we can hear you!
- Asshole.

657
00:57:50,763 --> 00:57:54,599
Sooner or later,
that door is gonna open

658
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,402
whether
you like it or not.

659
00:57:56,469 --> 00:57:58,304
So when that
door does open,

660
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,039
I want you to,
uh...

661
00:58:02,341 --> 00:58:04,210
I want you to
remember one thing.

662
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:06,178
Just go away.
What do you want?

663
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:09,181
I don't need
any of you alive.

664
00:58:11,616 --> 00:58:17,723
But if any one of you happens
to be able to help me find

665
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,758
what I came here for,
well, then...

666
00:58:21,861 --> 00:58:24,230
maybe we'll be able
to work something out.

667
00:58:32,738 --> 00:58:34,773
What do these guys want?

668
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,942
D's not even
in here anymore.

669
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:39,645
Maybe D was right, maybe
they're not here for him.

670
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:45,985
Maybe not, but if
they don't want D,

671
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:49,655
we need to find
out what they do want.

672
00:58:51,423 --> 00:58:52,958
Did you find me a boat yet?

673
00:58:53,025 --> 00:58:54,693
Everything's
closed till tomorrow,

674
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,229
but here's something,
it might be nothing,

675
00:58:57,296 --> 00:59:00,132
but a 36-foot luxury
yacht was reported stolen

676
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:03,569
from a marina about an
hour down the coast yesterday.

677
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:04,603
Was it D?

678
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,572
No,
a local boat captain

679
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,141
from that same marina
says he dropped off a guy

680
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,443
to the island today
who matches D's description.

681
00:59:12,778 --> 00:59:14,713
All right, send me the
address of the marina.

682
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:16,515
I need to get on
that island yesterday.

683
00:59:16,582 --> 00:59:18,784
- You got it.
- I'll talk to you.

684
00:59:25,124 --> 00:59:26,825
Fuck this,
man!

685
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:32,798
Where are you going?

686
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:36,402
The only way we're gonna find it is
by getting one of them to tell us.

687
00:59:36,468 --> 00:59:38,003
You know that.

688
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,206
There's gotta be
another way inside that place.

689
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:44,143
Fuck it.

690
00:59:49,215 --> 00:59:53,219
Seismic testing. What the
hell are you looking for?

691
00:59:54,186 --> 00:59:56,255
What the fuck
is going on here?

692
01:00:39,131 --> 01:00:42,067
Jesus, Blanchard,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

693
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:43,737
What the fuck
happened to you?

694
01:00:43,802 --> 01:00:45,904
He fucking shackled me.

695
01:00:50,175 --> 01:00:52,778
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah, yeah.

696
01:00:52,845 --> 01:00:54,113
Here.

697
01:01:15,669 --> 01:01:16,703
Where are you going?

698
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,804
- Hey!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

699
01:01:24,543 --> 01:01:25,944
Fucking son of a bitch.

700
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:52,571
You little...

701
01:01:54,873 --> 01:01:56,710
Oh,
I hate you.

702
01:01:56,776 --> 01:02:00,714
Hey! All right,
you little prick.

703
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,614
You want me to shoot
you through the door, huh?

704
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:19,331
Don't move.

705
01:02:22,635 --> 01:02:24,403
Are you crying,
huh?

706
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,638
Freddie...

707
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,141
go downstairs.

708
01:02:33,579 --> 01:02:37,483
You know,

709
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:40,820
I embarrassed
myself in front of you

710
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,421
down in that cellar,

711
01:02:43,188 --> 01:02:46,325
so I'm gonna have
to make it up to you.

712
01:02:52,197 --> 01:02:53,833
Oh,
you son of a bitch!

713
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:55,901
- Mom! Mom!
- Freddie! Freddie!

714
01:02:55,968 --> 01:02:58,504
What's the matter?
What's the matter? Are you okay?

715
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,773
Move!

716
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:02,007
Hey, back the fuck up!

717
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:03,075
- Hey, back the fuck up!
- Hey!

718
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:05,144
Everyone,
hands up now!

719
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:07,881
Ah,
you know what?

720
01:03:07,946 --> 01:03:10,382
It's just as well
that the boy left.

721
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:15,454
My friend Ethel
here is gonna join in.

722
01:03:16,155 --> 01:03:18,190
Who doesn't like
a threesome, huh?

723
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:24,296
You, put the gun down.
Put it down or I'll blow her brains out.

724
01:03:25,564 --> 01:03:26,598
I'll do it.

725
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:29,601
Just don't hurt her.

726
01:03:30,804 --> 01:03:32,438
- No, no.
- Good.

727
01:03:43,415 --> 01:03:44,583
Round two?

728
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:57,229
You know, D,
I feel...

729
01:03:57,296 --> 01:04:00,265
I feel that you
wanna cry right now.

730
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:02,936
What do you think,
huh?

731
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:04,838
Are you gonna
beg for your life, huh?

732
01:04:04,904 --> 01:04:07,339
Get the fuck up,
you son of a bitch.

733
01:04:17,282 --> 01:04:20,753
Come on, D,
you gotta give me something.

734
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,354
Not much point.

735
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:24,056
And why is that,
huh?

736
01:04:24,122 --> 01:04:26,225
Okay, okay,
I get it.

737
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:30,195
You are going
to try and stab me

738
01:04:30,262 --> 01:04:33,432
with one of these here
broken mirror pieces, huh?

739
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:36,736
Yeah.

740
01:04:40,072 --> 01:04:41,240
No.

741
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:46,078
Submarine. Japanese.

742
01:04:48,982 --> 01:04:53,352
Femoral artery. You're gonna
wanna put some pressure on that.

743
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,322
Too late.

744
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:01,728
Oh, my God,
I really enjoyed that.

745
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:09,769
Let her go.

746
01:05:09,836 --> 01:05:10,970
Are you okay?

747
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:14,573
- I'll shoot her.
- And I'll shoot you both.

748
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:15,541
What?

749
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:25,117
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

750
01:05:25,183 --> 01:05:26,218
Oh, God. Oh,
my God.

751
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:29,288
You almost
fucking killed me.

752
01:05:29,354 --> 01:05:31,557
Well,
good thing you moved.

753
01:05:34,827 --> 01:05:36,061
He killed Blanchard.

754
01:05:36,128 --> 01:05:37,630
He shot my fucking arm off,
almost.

755
01:05:40,098 --> 01:05:41,233
You came back.

756
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:45,137
What did you do,
huh? Huh?

757
01:05:45,203 --> 01:05:47,840
What did you do upstairs,
you sicko?

758
01:05:47,907 --> 01:05:49,575
Did you kill him or what?

759
01:05:49,642 --> 01:05:51,610
Mom, I've been giving
this a lot of thought

760
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:56,148
and I think that I
deserve a second chance.

761
01:05:56,214 --> 01:05:58,584
Oh,
my God! What?

762
01:05:58,651 --> 01:06:00,319
What did you do?

763
01:06:04,156 --> 01:06:05,825
Mom...

764
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,194
...that I can explain.

765
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:15,434
D, come out.
I wanna talk to you.

766
01:06:18,236 --> 01:06:20,606
Just stay
away from me please.

767
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:25,310
I can't... I can't...

768
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:29,949
That was the worst
thing I have ever seen.

769
01:06:38,223 --> 01:06:42,394
Hello, D.
It's been a long time.

770
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:46,331
I, uh... feel like
you've been avoiding me.

771
01:06:46,398 --> 01:06:47,900
Well,
I have.

772
01:06:49,869 --> 01:06:51,436
What happened to you,
man?

773
01:06:52,537 --> 01:06:53,706
Hmm?

774
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:56,943
You used to be
the best at what we do.

775
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:58,911
The absolute best.

776
01:06:58,978 --> 01:07:02,849
Now, you're in the system,
all drugged out,

777
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:06,485
therapy three times a week to
get in touch with your soft side.

778
01:07:08,587 --> 01:07:10,123
So what's he call it,
huh?

779
01:07:10,188 --> 01:07:12,457
Acute
sociopathic disorder?

780
01:07:12,524 --> 01:07:15,527
Or current
psychopathological behavior?

781
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:17,930
Arrested
moral development?

782
01:07:17,997 --> 01:07:22,200
Come on, D, these are
just fancy ways for these people

783
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:23,602
to call you insane.

784
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,337
They're
calling you insane.

785
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:27,774
You know me,
D.

786
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:30,076
Personally,
I-I don't believe in insane.

787
01:07:30,143 --> 01:07:33,211
You're not insane. I think it's
just different points of view.

788
01:07:35,014 --> 01:07:37,083
You taught me that,
right?

789
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:39,018
You got a
point to this shit?

790
01:07:39,085 --> 01:07:40,953
Yeah,
I got a point to this.

791
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:45,658
Are you just gonna keep pretending
for these fucking people,

792
01:07:45,725 --> 01:07:49,461
or are you gonna
accept what you really are, huh?

793
01:07:49,528 --> 01:07:51,463
Because what you
are is awesome, bro.

794
01:07:52,732 --> 01:07:55,802
That's why you're here,
right? Hmm?

795
01:07:56,936 --> 01:07:58,771
Sean must have told you

796
01:07:58,838 --> 01:08:00,472
what's here on the island,
right?

797
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,677
That's why
he's fucking dead, D.

798
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:11,516
Oh. You don't know.

799
01:08:17,056 --> 01:08:18,323
Take him.

800
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,626
Take him!

801
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:35,440
Seriously, you
didn't kill him either?

802
01:08:35,507 --> 01:08:38,811
After what you did to that guy
upstairs, what's the problem?

803
01:08:38,878 --> 01:08:40,847
- Oh, Jesus.
- What did he say?

804
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:46,251
He said
there's something...

805
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:50,223
on this island.

806
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,158
There's nothing here.

807
01:08:52,225 --> 01:08:55,094
There's a couple hundred dollars
for groceries, some antiques.

808
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:58,798
No... something here.

809
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:03,035
Sean was
trying to tell me.

810
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:07,173
He was trying to tell me
something before he died.

811
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:09,642
Sean. Come on,
D.

812
01:09:09,709 --> 01:09:10,877
You know Sean. He couldn't have
been involved with that evil...

813
01:09:10,943 --> 01:09:12,912
You're not listening!

814
01:09:14,379 --> 01:09:15,815
They were in
business with Sean

815
01:09:15,882 --> 01:09:19,786
and they are
here to find something.

816
01:09:19,852 --> 01:09:20,787
What is it?

817
01:09:22,354 --> 01:09:24,857
Hmm? What
aren't you telling me?

818
01:09:27,325 --> 01:09:31,429
You said that Sean died while he
was working on the lighthouse.

819
01:09:33,065 --> 01:09:34,332
I don't think he fell.

820
01:09:36,903 --> 01:09:40,239
No,
you said Hugh found him, right?

821
01:09:40,372 --> 01:09:43,943
Yeah, Hugh, Hugh. The son of a
bitch, he was talking to 'em too.

822
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:46,112
There was something. It
was like a moment that they had.

823
01:09:46,179 --> 01:09:47,814
- Okay, shut up.
- All right.

824
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:56,889
He was one of Cole's men planted
here to keep an eye on Sean.

825
01:09:58,557 --> 01:10:00,625
But he was
working on something.

826
01:10:03,863 --> 01:10:09,168
There was... engine
grease underneath his nails.

827
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:11,070
He's right.

828
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:13,706
D's been a lot of things, but
stupid was never one of them.

829
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,143
Where's Sean's office?

830
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,410
The cellar.

831
01:10:19,011 --> 01:10:22,447
Felix, we're gonna
try over there.

832
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:37,429
Come on,
Sean, talk to me.

833
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:44,036
Come on. What
were you working on?

834
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:55,948
It's not this.

835
01:11:06,826 --> 01:11:08,261
There's
that sound again.

836
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:10,428
I wanna go after him.

837
01:11:10,495 --> 01:11:12,798
I wanna go after him.
That freak tried to kill me.

838
01:11:12,865 --> 01:11:14,934
If D wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

839
01:11:15,001 --> 01:11:17,169
I can sneak back in the window like before.
They won't even know.

840
01:11:17,236 --> 01:11:20,605
Then maybe you should.
It'll save me a bullet.

841
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:30,850
Where's that door go?

842
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:35,087
That's the wine cellar.

843
01:11:35,154 --> 01:11:37,522
He spent two months restoring
it when we first moved in.

844
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:38,791
You have the keys?

845
01:11:38,858 --> 01:11:40,525
Yeah, I know
where the keys are.

846
01:12:04,417 --> 01:12:06,052
A footprint.

847
01:12:09,155 --> 01:12:10,189
From the boot.

848
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:16,228
No way.

849
01:12:19,332 --> 01:12:20,866
What the hell?

850
01:12:22,969 --> 01:12:24,070
Whoa!

851
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:28,040
A hidden door? Really?

852
01:12:28,107 --> 01:12:30,977
I never drank the merlot.
I... I...

853
01:12:32,778 --> 01:12:34,546
- Flashlight.
- Yeah.

854
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:44,489
- Cool.
- Freddie, come here.

855
01:12:44,556 --> 01:12:46,125
But it's the...

856
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:17,223
Oh,
Sean.

857
01:13:31,804 --> 01:13:33,172
What's down there?

858
01:13:39,478 --> 01:13:41,814
- I'm coming down!
- Jesus.

859
01:13:46,752 --> 01:13:49,455
Are
you down there?

860
01:13:49,522 --> 01:13:51,690
Oh,
sh...

861
01:13:57,163 --> 01:13:58,563
Jesus.

862
01:14:01,834 --> 01:14:02,835
D?

863
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:05,371
What do you see?

864
01:14:05,438 --> 01:14:07,073
The video's pretty bad,

865
01:14:07,139 --> 01:14:09,675
but we captured a still frame
on one of the yacht thieves.

866
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:11,077
I just sent it to you.

867
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:18,117
Wow. It's Cole,
100%.

868
01:14:18,184 --> 01:14:20,886
- Who?
- D's former employer.

869
01:14:20,986 --> 01:14:24,023
A high-level fixer for the
criminally rich and infamous.

870
01:14:24,123 --> 01:14:26,492
D started working for Cole
right after he was discharged

871
01:14:26,559 --> 01:14:30,162
from the SEALs for almost
killing his commanding officer.

872
01:14:31,664 --> 01:14:33,866
D was Cole's
weapon of choice.

873
01:14:35,634 --> 01:14:37,036
And now,
here they are,

874
01:14:37,803 --> 01:14:39,805
D and Cole together again.

875
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:42,942
Goddamn it,

876
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:44,944
I thought we'd see
the island from here.

877
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,779
Look, I'm sorry.
I've tried everywhere.

878
01:14:46,846 --> 01:14:48,447
No one is
willing to sail tonight.

879
01:14:48,514 --> 01:14:50,950
I'll call you if I come up
with anything.

880
01:14:51,616 --> 01:14:52,985
Hi.

881
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:54,954
Is everything
all right, ma'am?

882
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,422
Yeah.

883
01:14:56,489 --> 01:14:57,990
Can I help
you with something?

884
01:14:59,358 --> 01:15:01,227
As a matter of fact,
yeah.

885
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:03,028
You sure you know
what you're doing?

886
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:05,865
Oh, me? No, I'm
just fucking around.

887
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:07,233
I mean,
I'd let you try,

888
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:09,502
but it's best if
you have both eyes.

889
01:15:09,568 --> 01:15:11,003
Asshole.

890
01:15:17,143 --> 01:15:18,144
D?

891
01:15:18,878 --> 01:15:20,112
Down here!

892
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,851
D!

893
01:15:35,561 --> 01:15:37,229
What is this place?

894
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:51,310
D,
fucking don't leave me.

895
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:54,046
D could've been
halfway to Hawaii by now.

896
01:15:57,082 --> 01:15:58,918
Maybe he
really has changed.

897
01:16:15,201 --> 01:16:17,136
We're
gonna get lost in here.

898
01:16:20,839 --> 01:16:22,107
How far does this go?

899
01:16:29,915 --> 01:16:31,350
This is insane.

900
01:16:33,687 --> 01:16:35,087
Oh,
fuck.

901
01:16:48,702 --> 01:16:51,003
What the hell?
Shh!

902
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:52,838
Let's hit the lights.

903
01:16:57,309 --> 01:16:58,877
Holy fuck.

904
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:03,849
Holy shit.

905
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:10,022
It's a submarine.

906
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:13,359
Japanese.

907
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:16,128
World War II.

908
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:18,764
Huh?

909
01:17:19,932 --> 01:17:22,736
Oh,
my God.

910
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:25,371
Sean,
what the fuck is this?

911
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:29,975
Whoa,
whoa, whoa, hold on.

912
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:34,847
I think I found something.

913
01:17:37,049 --> 01:17:38,384
That looks like a tunnel.

914
01:17:40,819 --> 01:17:43,455
It goes from the inn...

915
01:17:48,728 --> 01:17:50,296
Holy shit.
To the lighthouse.

916
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:55,134
Fuck yeah. Jackpot!

917
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:57,503
All right.

918
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:01,240
You guys
find the entrance.

919
01:18:03,575 --> 01:18:05,210
I'll meet you down there.

920
01:18:06,545 --> 01:18:08,047
Come on,
let's go.

921
01:18:10,082 --> 01:18:13,285
He never told me
about any of this.

922
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:29,101
Fuck me. That's why
I never heard about this.

923
01:18:30,269 --> 01:18:32,137
D. Look.

924
01:18:35,642 --> 01:18:37,242
It's the Yamashita gold.

925
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:39,511
The Yamashita gold!

926
01:18:39,578 --> 01:18:41,046
What?

927
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:43,215
It's what he wrote about
in his books.

928
01:18:44,883 --> 01:18:46,085
Fuck!

929
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:52,891
What's that?

930
01:18:55,829 --> 01:18:57,262
God,
you scared the hell out of me.

931
01:18:57,329 --> 01:18:58,931
What's going on?
Where did D go?

932
01:18:58,997 --> 01:19:00,065
Where did Massey...

933
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:04,136
Move. Come on.

934
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:13,045
It's right here.
It's fucking real.

935
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:15,914
I thought Sean was
full of shit back in school.

936
01:19:15,981 --> 01:19:18,517
This is crazy!

937
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:21,520
That what he was trying to
tell me about in his letters.

938
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:25,792
He said, "I think I've found
what I've been looking for."

939
01:19:25,859 --> 01:19:28,293
Oh, fuck!

940
01:19:29,962 --> 01:19:31,096
Fuck.

941
01:19:33,532 --> 01:19:35,434
Jesus Christ!

942
01:19:45,745 --> 01:19:46,679
Run!

943
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,628
- Come on down!
- Damn it.

944
01:20:04,463 --> 01:20:05,964
- See 'em right there!
- Get 'em from the other side.

945
01:20:06,031 --> 01:20:08,233
Can you move?
There's only one shot left.

946
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:11,470
- Hey?
- Yeah.

947
01:20:11,537 --> 01:20:12,538
Keep up,
follow me.

948
01:20:13,238 --> 01:20:14,406
Where are you going?

949
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:20,880
- Come on, take him!
- Shoot him!

950
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,314
I got the bastard!

951
01:20:24,818 --> 01:20:28,020
Shit! Shit!

952
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:37,963
What are you doing?

953
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:39,531
You have a cell phone?

954
01:20:39,598 --> 01:20:40,599
One
of them's down.

955
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:41,935
Are you making
a call right now?

956
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,837
- Shut up.
- Are you serious?

957
01:20:43,903 --> 01:20:45,337
- They're shooting at us.
- Shh.

958
01:20:45,404 --> 01:20:46,840
- Screw you!
- Stop.

959
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,422
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

960
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,159
D,
what time is it?

961
01:21:07,226 --> 01:21:08,695
- Uh...
- Can you see 'em?

962
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:11,263
Three-ish. Sorry.
It's late. I know.

963
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:14,801
I just have one
question for you.

964
01:21:14,868 --> 01:21:17,102
Sure,
shoot.

965
01:21:17,169 --> 01:21:21,473
If I have to save myself, uh,
could I go back to my old ways then?

966
01:21:22,474 --> 01:21:25,745
Well,
I guess I'd have to say

967
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:29,381
that you really wouldn't
be saving yourself at all

968
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:32,317
if you give up on all that
great work that you've done.

969
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:33,585
There he is!

970
01:21:35,788 --> 01:21:37,189
What the hell was that?

971
01:21:37,523 --> 01:21:39,591
5.56 mm semiautomatic
machine gun.

972
01:21:39,692 --> 01:21:40,894
You're being shot at?

973
01:21:40,994 --> 01:21:43,428
Oh, yeah, they've been
shooting at us for a while now.

974
01:21:45,497 --> 01:21:48,600
- D, listen to me, listen.
- Okay.

975
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:51,303
Do whatever it takes
to save your ass.

976
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:52,805
Whatever it takes?

977
01:21:52,872 --> 01:21:54,339
Whatever it takes.

978
01:21:57,142 --> 01:22:00,178
Fuck. I'll lose
my fucking license.

979
01:22:07,185 --> 01:22:08,788
Jesus Christ.

980
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:27,774
Please work,
please work.

981
01:23:06,813 --> 01:23:07,847
Kill 'em!

982
01:23:25,732 --> 01:23:26,699
Fuck me.

983
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:39,646
Whoo-hoo.

984
01:23:42,214 --> 01:23:44,249
- Where are you going?
- Shh!

985
01:23:50,255 --> 01:23:53,926
- D!
- Stop! Stop right there.

986
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:59,164
So you've found it,
huh?

987
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:00,833
I knew I
could count on you.

988
01:24:04,403 --> 01:24:08,641
Wow, your brother
kind of undersold it, didn't he?

989
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:15,580
It's too bad that he's not
gonna get to enjoy any of it.

990
01:24:16,314 --> 01:24:17,382
Stop right there.

991
01:24:19,819 --> 01:24:21,620
I still need you alive.

992
01:24:23,288 --> 01:24:24,757
Hey,
asshole!

993
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:30,462
Shoot! Oh,
shit!

994
01:24:32,799 --> 01:24:34,566
No, no,
no.

995
01:24:36,468 --> 01:24:39,204
D,
listen to me.

996
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:43,542
This is so stupid,
huh?

997
01:24:43,608 --> 01:24:45,645
Let's just grab as
much of this gold as we can

998
01:24:45,712 --> 01:24:47,947
and let's get
the hell out of here.

999
01:24:48,014 --> 01:24:51,117
'Cause when the feds show up,
they're gonna lock your ass up forever.

1000
01:24:51,316 --> 01:24:52,785
I didn't come here
for the gold.

1001
01:24:54,153 --> 01:24:55,888
I just want
my family back.

1002
01:24:59,025 --> 01:25:00,425
Well, then,
you got a deal.

1003
01:25:01,894 --> 01:25:06,833
You carry my gold and I'll
give you your mommy back.

1004
01:25:08,634 --> 01:25:09,869
Come on,
let's go.

1005
01:25:09,936 --> 01:25:12,004
It'll take days to
get this out of here.

1006
01:25:12,171 --> 01:25:13,371
You don't have the time.

1007
01:25:13,438 --> 01:25:14,606
Well,
neither do you.

1008
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:18,077
But you're a good,
strong, strapping lad.

1009
01:25:18,144 --> 01:25:20,512
Let's grab it. Hurry up.

1010
01:25:23,683 --> 01:25:26,251
All right,
give me two ingots, uh,

1011
01:25:26,318 --> 01:25:28,020
for what your
dead brother owes me.

1012
01:25:31,991 --> 01:25:33,291
That's it.

1013
01:25:35,194 --> 01:25:36,461
Atta boy.

1014
01:25:37,797 --> 01:25:41,801
Two more for
interest. Come on.

1015
01:25:43,368 --> 01:25:45,004
That's it. Hurry up.

1016
01:25:46,005 --> 01:25:48,241
And, uh,
you know what,

1017
01:25:48,306 --> 01:25:52,245
why don't you just give
me two on top of that just, um...

1018
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:54,312
I don't know,
just for the fuck of it.

1019
01:26:03,156 --> 01:26:04,422
That's it.

1020
01:26:13,633 --> 01:26:17,770
There he is. That's it,
strong guy.

1021
01:26:27,512 --> 01:26:28,848
Come on,
D.

1022
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:31,918
Atta boy.

1023
01:26:35,888 --> 01:26:37,790
Pick it up.

1024
01:26:37,857 --> 01:26:39,624
There's no
rest stops. Let's go.

1025
01:26:46,498 --> 01:26:48,466
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1026
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:52,071
Hey,
get up.

1027
01:27:05,818 --> 01:27:08,688
Come here.

1028
01:27:10,323 --> 01:27:11,991
Come here. Come here.

1029
01:27:12,959 --> 01:27:13,893
Come here.

1030
01:27:19,497 --> 01:27:20,833
All right,
get up.

1031
01:27:23,336 --> 01:27:25,705
Pick it up,
or else your mom goes flying.

1032
01:27:30,009 --> 01:27:31,110
Game over,
D.

1033
01:27:34,947 --> 01:27:38,416
You're making a fatal mistake,
Agent Shaughnessy.

1034
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:40,353
Where's Cole?

1035
01:27:40,418 --> 01:27:41,654
He's right here.

1036
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,998
Pick up the gold.

1037
01:27:53,465 --> 01:27:55,034
Pick up the fucking gold!

1038
01:27:58,104 --> 01:28:00,572
That's it. Good boy.

1039
01:28:01,707 --> 01:28:04,343
Hey, D,
what are the odds? Huh?

1040
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:06,544
While you
were rehabilitating,

1041
01:28:06,611 --> 01:28:09,282
your straight-as-an-arrow
brother decides

1042
01:28:09,348 --> 01:28:11,250
to borrow money
from the wrong people.

1043
01:28:11,317 --> 01:28:13,152
Well...

1044
01:28:13,219 --> 01:28:16,088
he knew that sooner
or later that I'd show up.

1045
01:28:16,155 --> 01:28:18,224
You know how it is.

1046
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:21,294
And now here
you are.

1047
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:25,932
Oh, D, I gotta tell you, thought
I'd be happier to see you.

1048
01:28:25,998 --> 01:28:30,970
But you're just so
goddamn sad to me now, huh?

1049
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:34,907
Pathetic,
powerless.

1050
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:37,843
You used to run this shit.

1051
01:28:39,745 --> 01:28:41,814
You know why
he's doing all this, huh?

1052
01:28:41,881 --> 01:28:45,718
He's doing this for you,
mama. That's right.

1053
01:28:45,785 --> 01:28:47,687
You don't
have to do this, D.

1054
01:28:47,753 --> 01:28:49,322
- Shut up.
- He's gonna kill us anyway!

1055
01:28:49,388 --> 01:28:50,555
Shut up.

1056
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:54,626
You're right.

1057
01:28:56,561 --> 01:28:57,964
I don't.

1058
01:29:00,733 --> 01:29:02,467
You're fucking insane!

1059
01:29:05,638 --> 01:29:07,173
Fucking insane!

1060
01:29:08,307 --> 01:29:11,877
You're expending so much energy trying
to hide who you are, what you are.

1061
01:29:11,944 --> 01:29:13,478
You're a fucking monster.

1062
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:17,249
And I'll constantly be
that voice in your head,

1063
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:21,120
reminding you that you're
never gonna fucking change!

1064
01:30:33,426 --> 01:30:35,261
I'm not insane.

1065
01:31:27,046 --> 01:31:28,914
You're not gonna die here.

1066
01:31:49,235 --> 01:31:52,171
Um... I'm sorry.

1067
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:54,673
Stop
saying you're sorry.

1068
01:31:55,808 --> 01:31:59,979
Sorry for your loss...
for Sean.

1069
01:32:35,347 --> 01:32:37,983
When I think back
to all Sean's letters,

1070
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:41,554
it's clear now that he
was dying to tell someone

1071
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,122
what he discovered,

1072
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:46,458
but to keep his family safe,
he knew he never could.

1073
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:49,195
When he became obsessed

1074
01:32:49,261 --> 01:32:52,097
with the abandoned naval
base called Guardian Island,

1075
01:32:52,164 --> 01:32:55,100
I figured he was
just writing another book.

1076
01:32:55,167 --> 01:32:57,136
He must have
been pretty damn sure

1077
01:32:57,203 --> 01:33:01,173
of what was under that island,
the Yamashita gold,

1078
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:06,145
war loot taken by Japanese
Imperial forces during World War II

1079
01:33:06,212 --> 01:33:09,248
and smuggled out of the
country in small submarines.

1080
01:33:09,315 --> 01:33:11,651
Sean put
together the clues,

1081
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:14,453
but needed help
buying Guardian Island.

1082
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,555
He borrowed money
from Cole's associates

1083
01:33:16,622 --> 01:33:20,426
and before he could pay it back,
Cole came after him

1084
01:33:21,627 --> 01:33:23,697
and it cost
him everything.

1085
01:33:24,063 --> 01:33:26,832
Looks like Sean wasn't
so perfect after all.

1086
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:31,503
Nobody's perfect,
but he didn't deserve to die.

1087
01:33:34,641 --> 01:33:36,942
They're gonna come
after you, you know.

1088
01:33:37,009 --> 01:33:40,279
Well, I've been hunted
before. I can handle it.

1089
01:33:40,346 --> 01:33:43,415
What about Sean's
family, your mother?

1090
01:33:43,482 --> 01:33:44,684
They'll be okay.

1091
01:33:44,750 --> 01:33:46,318
I'll make sure of it.

1092
01:33:46,385 --> 01:33:48,320
What about you?

1093
01:33:48,387 --> 01:33:50,756
I might try being
myself for a while.

1094
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,298
Bye,
D.
