2
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,853
I got shot.

3
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,194
I always felt like I'd be shot.

4
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,366
Somebody was trying
to do me some harm

5
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:16,626
because a lot of people don't like me.

6
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,602
But I didn't think it was gonna happen
at that particular moment.

7
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,638
I'm surprised, but I'm happy.

8
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,144
I believe that, you know,
this is all in God's hands.

9
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,983
And I'm very appreciative to God
for everything I've gotten to do.

10
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,029
But also, about death, we look at
death from the selfish side, like:

11
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,899
"That guy died. Oh, it's so sad."
Why is it sad?

12
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:57,201
He's away from all of this
bad stuff that's here on Earth.

13
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,006
I mean, at the worst, he's just
somewhere quiet, no nothing.

14
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:10,480
At best, he's an angel... or he's
a spirit somewhere.

15
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,124
What is so bad about that?

16
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,886
Throughout my life, I just wanted
to be like an angel for God,

17
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,429
do something
where I could be of some help.

18
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,329
And I can do that.
I mean, I'm an artist.

19
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,835
It's not like I have to tell the truth.
I have to tell a story

20
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,168
and reach you and get
some kind of feeling from you.

21
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,376
And then try to get the moral across.

22
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,111
So this is my story.

23
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:42,687
A story about ambition,
violence, redemption and love.

24
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:59,032
In my life, I was different things
for different people.

25
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,467
What's up, nigga?

26
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,506
Don't fuck around with real Gs
Quick to snatch your ugly ass

27
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,268
- Off the streets
- So fuck peace

28
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,378
I let them niggas know
It's on for life

29
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,946
So let the West Side ride tonight

30
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,014
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed

31
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,015
- Fuck with me you'll get your
- Caps peeled

32
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,448
Yeah, my niggas say...

33
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,317
Some people say
I was a thug and a gangsta.

34
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,485
Other people remember me
as a poet and a born leader.

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,625
But I'm saying to you
measure a man by his actions fully,

36
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,604
through his whole life,
from the beginning to the end.

37
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,016
Everybody's past
is what made their future.

38
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,949
It's, like, about destiny.

39
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:54,523
Speak, drums
Tell the real story

40
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,455
My mother was a Black Panther,

41
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,188
and she was really involved
in the movement.

42
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:02,163
Power! Power!

43
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:06,270
Power to the people!
Power to the people!

44
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,139
You know, just black people bettering
themselves and things like that.

45
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,522
She had a high position in the Panther
Party, which was unheard of,

46
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,125
because there was sexism,
even in the Panthers.

47
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,491
All of my roots
to the struggle are real deep.

48
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,965
I was named after this Inca chief
from South America

49
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,196
whose name was Tupac Amaru.
And I think the tribal breakdown

50
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:44,900
means, like, intelligent warrior,
something like that. He's a deep dude.

51
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,046
If I go to South America,
they're gonna love me.

52
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,307
My stepfather at the time,
Mutulu Shakur,

53
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,452
he was also, like,
a well-known revolutionary.

54
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,122
And then my godfather,
Geronimo Pratt,

55
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:01,020
had a top official rank position
with the Panthers on the West Coast.

56
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:05,027
You can jail a revolutionary,
but you can't jail a revolution.

57
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,835
I think that my mother,
like Fred Hampton, Mark Clark,

58
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,701
Harriet Tubman, they felt
like they were laying tracks

59
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,876
for a generation to come.

60
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:22,878
Come in, little brothers, sisters. Y'all
sit down and get something to eat.

61
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,718
There was always
white people around helping out.

62
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,119
But still, you know, there's racism.

63
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,918
So when the Panthers hit,
the government panicked.

64
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,927
And they felt like the Panthers were
detrimental to American society.

65
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,861
Remember, this country had
a man named J. Edgar Hoover,

66
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,231
whose job it was to destroy the
credibility of any black man coming up.

67
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,874
- That's what they did to the Panthers.
- Power to the people.

68
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,748
The government raided every
Panther's house, especially the ones

69
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,856
who they felt like could do the
most damage as an orator.

70
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:09,323
So they just burst in and put a gun
to my mother's head and said:

71
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,793
"Don't move. You're under arrest."

72
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,796
They treated her
like less than human.

73
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,266
My mother was pregnant
with me while she was in prison.

74
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,866
She was her own attorney,
never been to law school.

75
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,635
She was facing 300
and something odd years.

76
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,842
One black woman,
pregnant, beat the case.

77
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,812
That just goes to show you
the strength of a black woman

78
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,452
and the strength of the oppressed.

79
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,388
And a month after she got out
of prison, she gave birth to me.

80
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:45,121
So I was cultivated in prison.
My embryo was in prison.

81
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,331
When I was a little baby, I remember
that one moment of calm peace,

82
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,163
and three minutes after that,
it was on.

83
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,595
I rebelled against my mother
because she was in the movement

84
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:31,038
and we never spent time together. She
was speaking and going to colleges.

85
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,374
I used to feel like she cared more
about the people than her people.

86
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,142
And then after that was over,
it was more time spent with me,

87
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,753
and we were like, "You're my mother."
She was like, "You're my son."

88
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,652
Then she was really close
with me and really strict, almost.

89
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,997
My mother is totally brilliant,
totally understanding and caring.

90
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,864
And she's human. I mean, she'll be
wrong a lot, but we can talk about it.

91
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,198
She taught me how
to be community-oriented,

92
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,999
and to analyze society.

93
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,645
Me and my sister grew up good, and
we have good minds and everything.

94
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,178
But we just didn't have money.

95
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,857
Poverty is...

96
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,030
It's no joke. If there was no money
and everything depended

97
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,029
on your moral standards
and the way you treated people,

98
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,600
we'd be millionaires. We'd be rich.

99
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,330
But, since it's not like that,
then we're stone-broke.

100
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,668
I can't always have what I want
or things that I think I need.

101
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,641
Poverty, if I hated anything,
it would be that.

102
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,576
You and me were born
and raised in Harlem.

103
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,146
And every time you put it down,
you're not only putting us down,

104
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,581
but Mama and Papa.

105
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,660
My real father was a Black Panther,

106
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:59,194
but when I was growing up, I never
knew who my father was for sure.

107
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,834
My stepfather was a gangster,
a straight-up street hustler.

108
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,900
My mom had a kid,
he didn't even care.

109
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:08,039
He's like, "That's my son,"
took care of me, gave me money.

110
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,708
He was a criminal too,
out doing his thing.

111
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,435
So he only came,
brought me money and then left.

112
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,309
It's OK to go to Harlem and celebrate
your birthday with your friends,

113
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,609
but I don't think we would really fit in.

114
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,914
I hate saying this because whites
love hearing blacks talk about this.

115
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,318
I know for a fact that,
had I had a father,

116
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,484
I'd have had some discipline,
I'd have had more confidence.

117
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,697
Your mother cannot calm you down
the way a man can.

118
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,801
Your mother can't reassure you
the way a man can.

119
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,337
My mother couldn't show me
where my manhood was.

120
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,804
You need a man to teach you
how to be a man.

121
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,746
When I was young,
I was quiet, withdrawn.

122
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,547
I read a lot. I wrote poetry.
I kept a diary.

123
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,954
I watched TV all the time.
I stayed in front of the television.

124
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,425
And I could see all these people
out there in this pretend world.

125
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,326
And I knew I could be
part of it if I pretended too.

126
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,127
The way Arnold looked
on Diff'rent Strokes,

127
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,237
I used to like the lifestyle,
the way he used to live.

128
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,101
So early on,
I just watched and emulated.

129
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,368
I thought if I can be an actor
and act like those characters,

130
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,375
I could have some of their joy.

131
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,514
Oh, thank you, Mr. D!

132
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:28,676
If I could act like I had a big family,
I wouldn't feel as lonely.

133
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,915
My first acting job
was at the Apollo Theater

134
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:37,926
when Jesse Jackson
was running for president in 1984.

135
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,955
It was a fundraiser,
and I was a little kid.

136
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,466
Travis, from Raisin in the Sun.
When the curtain went up,

137
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,138
I just caught that bug
that everybody talks about.

138
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,275
I was like, "Whoa, this is it."

139
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,846
It was better than sex and anything,
money, everything. It was like, "Whoa,

140
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,777
"I want this."

141
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,153
We moved out of New York
because my mother lost her job.

142
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,085
We were, like, stranded.

143
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,495
So we moved to Baltimore...

144
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,228
...which was total ignorance town
to me.

145
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,805
I mean, Baltimore has the highest rate
of blacks killing blacks in the country.

146
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,202
Then I auditioned for the
Baltimore School of Performing Arts.

147
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,675
Then I started
to have good-luck times.

148
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,371
Parents are the same
No matter time nor place

149
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,711
They don't understand that us kids
Are gonna make some mistakes

150
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,719
So to you, all the kids all across
The land, there's no need to argue

151
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,448
Parents just don't understand

152
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,365
I spent three years in Baltimore,
high-school years. I made friends,

153
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,228
like Jon Cole and Jada Pinkett.

154
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,835
You should've seen
This girl's bodily dimensions

155
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,337
I honked my horn to get her attention
She said, "Was that for me?"

156
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,100
I said, "Yeah. " She said, "Why?"

157
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,074
I said, "Come on and take a ride
With a hell of a guy"

158
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,078
I loved my classes.
We were exposed to everything.

159
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,186
You know, theater, ballet...

160
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,165
...listening to different types of music,

161
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,464
songs that became
a soundtrack to my life.

162
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,938
But in my homeboys' high school,
it's not like that.

163
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,672
They don't have trips
to go see this Broadway play,

164
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,319
they don't read things we read.
They didn't know when I was like:

165
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,219
"Yo, Shakespeare's dope." They don't
have the same experiences we had.

166
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,192
Then I started thinking
the art school I went to

167
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,659
was mostly for white kids
and rich minorities.

168
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,492
I started going, "I would have
been totally different

169
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,634
"had I not been exposed to this."

170
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,141
I was living in the ghetto.
We didn't have lights and electricity.

171
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,608
- We was about to get evicted.
- We want home!

172
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,678
We want heat! We want lights!

173
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:13,079
We want something
to do for our children!

174
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:18,189
I thought, "We're not being taught
to deal with the world as it is."

175
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,153
The rich should live
like the poor,

176
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,658
the poor should live like the rich.
They should change every week.

177
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,039
The president stirred up
a hornets' nest earlier this week

178
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,403
when he suggested
the problems of the hungry

179
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:42,411
came about because they were
uninformed about where to go for help.

180
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:48,314
How could Reagan live in a White
House, which has a lot of rooms,

181
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,717
and there be homelessness?
And he's talking about helping.

182
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:55,051
I don't believe that there is anyone

183
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,159
that is going hungry in America
simply by reason

184
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:01,595
of denial or lack of ability
to feed them.

185
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,534
It is by people not knowing
where or how to get this help.

186
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,401
Why can't he take people off the street
and put them in his White House?

187
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,235
Then he'll have people from the streets
to help him with his ideas.

188
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,280
Not helpless! Homeless!
Not helpless!

189
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,749
They haven't been homeless forever.
They've done things in society.

190
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,549
The White House would be tainted
because he doesn't want to get dirty.

191
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:34,961
Growing up in America, I loved my
childhood, but I hated growing up poor.

192
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,598
We live in hell. We live in the gutter.
We live in a war zone.

193
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,204
We've got us stacked
up 80-deep in one building.

194
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,843
When you get out your house,
you're strapped to protect yourself.

195
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,655
The same crime element
that white people are scared of

196
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,722
black people are scared of.

197
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:04,726
While they waiting for legislation
to pass, we next door to the killer.

198
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,865
All them killers they let out,
they're in that building.

199
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,831
Just because we black,
we get along with the killers?

200
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,528
What is that?
We need protection too.

201
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,015
Then I came to California
to escape that violence.

202
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,697
Come to Marin City,
and there's even more poverty.

203
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:43,395
I was starting to see the one
thing we have in common

204
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,002
as black people,
is we share that poverty.

205
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,770
I made it to where I had knowledge
this wasn't just me.

206
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,877
It was a bigger picture.
It was my people getting dogged.

207
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,172
It wasn't just my family.
It was all of us.

208
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:07,185
Moving to Baltimore and Oakland
and Marin and New York,

209
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,385
and the poverty helped me
to relate to everybody's struggle.

210
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,627
Don't get the wrong idea.
I feel like I'm being gloomy.

211
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,858
I don't mean just to be like,
"Damn it, it's bad out there."

212
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,832
I still try to be positive.

213
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,064
I know that good things
are gonna come for me.

214
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,936
- Where you go to school?
- Are you rolling?

215
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,080
- Yeah, rolling.
- Go ahead, that's OK.

216
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,873
You dressed right for it.

217
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,018
He said he's been a little chilly,
so this is good for him.

218
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,916
- Somebody will enjoy the heat in here.
- Anytime.

219
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:43,356
OK. My name is Tupac Shakur,
and I attend Tamalpais High School.

220
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,860
And I'm 17 years old.

221
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,728
Oh, my God,
I got the phattest dיjא vu.

222
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:54,295
I chased girls and bought the car
and loud music,

223
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,634
but I like to think of myself
as really being socially aware.

224
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,936
Kept my history a mystery
But now I see

225
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,113
The American dream
Wasn't meant for me

226
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,441
'Cause Lady Liberty's a hypocrite
She lied to me

227
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,675
Promised me freedom, education
Equality

228
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,445
I think there should be
a class on drugs.

229
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:13,113
There should be a class on sex
education, a real sex-education class.

230
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,490
There should be a class
on police brutality.

231
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,756
There should be a class on apartheid.

232
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,002
There should be a class
on why people are hungry.

233
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,140
But there are not.
There are classes on gym.

234
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,937
Physical education.
Let's learn volleyball.

235
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,909
Fathers of this country
Never cared for me

236
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,276
They kept my ancestors
Shackled up in slavery

237
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,577
And Uncle Sam never did
A damn thing for me

238
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,845
Except lie about the facts
In my history

239
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,148
Now I'm sitting here mad
Because I'm unemployed

240
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,325
But the government's glad
Because they enjoy

241
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,585
When my people are down
So they can screw us around

242
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,025
Time to change the government now
No more

243
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,864
How do you think you're
most like your mom?

244
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,697
I'm most like my mom
because I'm arrogant. Totally arrogant.

245
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,100
You should see us when we get
in our attitude moods.

246
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,301
We get in our tiffs and everything,
but it's good.

247
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,944
My mom's my homey,
but we went through our stages,

248
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,311
where first we was mother and son,

249
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,851
then it was like drill sergeant
and cadet.

250
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,753
Then it was like dictator, little country.

251
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,825
Then I moved out,
and I was on my own.

252
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,860
I was broke, nowhere to stay.

253
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,897
I smoked weed.
I hung out with the drug dealers,

254
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,194
pimps and the criminals.

255
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,667
They were the only people
that cared about me.

256
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,966
And I needed a father.
I needed a male influence,

257
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,473
and these were the males.

258
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,805
You could see where I spent time
in the streets when you talk to me.

259
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,044
The words I say don't come
from a mother's or father's mouth.

260
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:54,021
They come from a pimp's mouth or a
prostitute or a hustler or drug dealer.

261
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,525
To me, these were my role models.

262
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:01,592
My mom was lost at that particular
moment. She was addicted to crack.

263
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,068
It was hard. It was hard
because she was my hero.

264
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,736
Not long ago in Oakland, California,

265
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,967
I was asked by a group of children
what to do if they were offered drugs.

266
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,771
And I answered, "Just say no."

267
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,582
I was broke. I didn't have enough
credits to graduate, so I dropped out.

268
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,549
I said, "I gotta get paid.
I gotta make a living."

269
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,552
I started selling drugs
for maybe two weeks.

270
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:29,249
The dude was like, "Give me my drugs
back," because I didn't know how.

271
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,760
The dope dealers used to look out
for me. They would give me money

272
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,662
and be like, "Don't get involved with
this. Get out there, do your dream."

273
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,859
So they was like my sponsors.

274
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,040
My dream was
to make a living rapping.

275
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,641
Just to make music
that was coming from my heart.

276
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,244
When I first started rapping, I needed
the money, and I had to work.

277
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,472
Yeah, sexy baby

278
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,583
Do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump

279
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,650
Sexy baby

280
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,017
Do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump

281
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:03,092
Do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump

282
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,432
That was me.

283
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:23,678
For me to get paid, I had to go out in
bikini briefs and hop on top of this doll.

284
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:25,873
I was homeless.
That's what I had to do.

285
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,848
You have to work from one point
to go to another point.

286
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,453
I admire the work ethic.

287
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:34,683
Do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump

288
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,356
Do the Humpty Hump
Just watch me do the Humpty Hump

289
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,832
Shock was responsible
for my success.

290
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,002
I'm the original two-tone,
big-nosed, skinny rapper.

291
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,897
Shock G.

292
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:51,200
Leila introduced me to Atron who
was managing Digital Underground.

293
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,107
He was like, "I'll send you to Digital
Underground. They're in the studio.

294
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,579
"Rap for Shock G on the spot.
If he like you, I'll pick you up."

295
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,116
I walked in and rapped.

296
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,414
He was like, "Good. You're in."
Boom, boom. "See you later."

297
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:06,853
And I left, walked out
of there like, "Dang."

298
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:14,959
Shock was like, "Come on the road.
Be my roadie. It ain't glamorous.

299
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,727
"You'll be working, meeting people."
I said, "Cool."

300
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,428
Off the road, he said, "I'm gonna pay
you and let you do 'Same Song'."

301
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,904
I did "Same Song".
Ever since, it's been on.

302
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,304
- Tupac, rock this
- I clown around when I hang

303
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,842
Around with the Underground

304
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,980
Girls who used to frown
Say I'm down when I come around

305
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,480
Gas me and when they pass me
They used to diss me

306
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,845
Harass me but now they ask me
If they can kiss me

307
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,214
Get some fame, people change
Wanna live their life high

308
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,185
Same song, can't go wrong
If I play the nice guy

309
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,859
Claiming fame must have changed
Now that we became strong

310
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,393
I remain, still the same
Because it's the same song

311
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:50,000
I look back with the greatest fondness.
Those were some of the best times.

312
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,295
Watch this one.

313
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:57,941
I'm gonna fuck you up.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

314
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,772
DJ Mark, "The 45 King"
This is your thing

315
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,416
Check out how we swing
Look at my ding-a-ling

316
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,348
And know that I am the king
A lyrical lunatic

317
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,045
I can rap slow or quick
About fishing or politics

318
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:15,249
It don't matter because girls
Be on your dick

319
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,966
Atron had been shopping
my demo tape as a solo album.

320
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,573
All of a sudden, Interscope got in touch
with us, and I was told that Ted Field,

321
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,007
this millionaire, multimillionaire,
his daughter had heard my demo,

322
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:37,306
and she liked it. So he was like,
"That's how I picked you."

323
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,007
And I was like,
"Well, tell your daughter thanks."

324
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,051
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel

325
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,120
The rebel of the Underground

326
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:48,724
So I went from being unknown
to now having a platinum record.

327
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,829
2Pacalypse Now is a story of a young
black male, from track one to track 13,

328
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:57,934
whether it be about teenage
pregnancy, police brutality or poverty.

329
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:01,663
Also, I tell my own personal problems.

330
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,238
All my songs deal with the pain
that I've felt from my childhood.

331
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,676
That's what makes me do what I do.

332
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:30,430
My inspiration for writing music is, like,
Don McLean when he did "Vincent",

333
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,694
Lorraine Hansberry
with Raisin in the Sun,

334
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,964
Shakespeare when he does his things.

335
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,038
Like deep stories, you know,
like raw human needs.

336
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:53,214
I just try to speak about things
that affect me and our community.

337
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,189
Sometimes I'm the watcher
and sometimes the participant.

338
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,363
Sometimes it's just allegories
or fables that have a moral

339
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,657
or theme,
like the ghetto lifestyle.

340
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,836
Brenda's belly's getting bigger
But no one seems to notice

341
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:07,561
Any change in her figure
She's 12 years old

342
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,536
And she's having a baby
In love with the molester

343
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,539
Who's sexing her crazy

344
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,905
She thinks that he'll be
With her forever

345
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,877
And dreams of a world
Where the two of them are together

346
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,311
Whatever

347
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,487
I seen that, the crack babies,
what we had to go through,

348
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,417
Iosing everything and being poor
and getting beat down.

349
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,457
Being the person I am, I said,
"No, I'm changing this."

350
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,629
I'm trying to think of a good analogy.

351
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:37,359
It's like you've
got the Vietnam War, right?

352
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,697
And just because the reporters
show us pictures at home

353
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:44,342
of the Vietnam War, that's what made
the Vietnam War end when it did,

354
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,444
or the shit probably
would have lasted longer.

355
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,982
If no one knew
exactly what was going on,

356
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,419
we just thought they were just dying
valiantly, in some beautiful way.

357
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:04,425
But because we saw the horror, that's
what made us stop the Vietnam War.

358
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:07,564
I thought, "That's what I'll
do as an artist, as a rapper.

359
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,257
"I'm gonna show the
graphic details of what I see

360
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:14,564
"and my community,
and hopefully they'll stop it, quit."

361
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,537
Hello, I'm Tanya Hart,
and welcome to our show.

362
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:26,979
My guest today has experienced a truly
horrendous life to just be 20 years old.

363
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,643
His family portrait could well be
a poster for America's Most Wanted.

364
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,451
His lyrics are controversial but also
a reality of life as he has seen it.

365
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,594
My ear is to the streets.

366
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,560
I represent 20 years
on this planet Earth

367
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,596
and what I've seen.
This is my report.

368
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,266
It's like my battle cry to America.

369
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,529
They got me trapped

370
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,837
They can't keep the black man down

371
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,010
They got me trapped

372
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,243
No, they can't keep
The black man down

373
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,508
In my album, the number one enemy
is the crooked police officer.

374
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,152
They got me trapped
Can barely walk the city streets

375
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:05,323
Without a cop har-asking me
Searching me then asking my identity

376
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,617
And the ironic thing
is that it never happened to me.

377
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,988
I was speaking
from the stories of my peers.

378
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,290
Cuffed up, throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me

379
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:18,230
I mean, I said all of these things,
and then it happened to me.

380
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:22,202
I had no record, all my life,
no police record, until I made a record.

381
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,137
As my video was debuting on MTV,
I was behind bars,

382
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:27,538
getting beat up
by the police department.

383
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,943
Good morning.
My name is John Burris,

384
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:36,052
and I am here today with my client,
Tupac Amaru Shakur,

385
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:42,056
as well as other members of the
Digital Underground rap group

386
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:48,665
and some members of the
Digital Underground rap group,

387
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,233
a combination of the various groups.

388
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,664
Basically, I walked across
the street at 17th and Broadway.

389
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:01,005
The police officers stopped me on
the sidewalk and asked to see my ID.

390
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,773
They sweated me about my name.
The officers said:

391
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,315
"You have to learn your place."

392
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,384
They were charging me
with jaywalking.

393
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:14,820
I was riffing, arguing about why would
they charge me with a petty crime.

394
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:19,693
I kept yelling, asking them
to give me my citation and let me go.

395
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,265
Next thing I know, my face
was being buried into the concrete,

396
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,902
and I was laying facedown
in the gutter,

397
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,540
waking up
from being unconscious in cuffs

398
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,438
with blood on my face.
And I'm going to jail for resisting arrest.

399
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,873
That's harassment to me,

400
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,708
that I have to be stopped
in the street and checked,

401
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,941
like we're in South Africa
and asked for my ID.

402
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,086
Officer Boyavich repeatedly
slammed my face into the floor,

403
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:46,746
while Rogers put the cuffs on.
That's not called for, for jaywalking.

404
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,825
I got a ten-million-dollar lawsuit.
They said they would settle,

405
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,964
but nobody cared.
That wasn't blew up all over the news.

406
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:58,864
They didn't see me on TV with my eye
and head busted. There are pictures.

407
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,368
- In Oakland?
- Yes. You don't see them.

408
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,235
You see pictures of Tupac
coming out of jail in cuffs.

409
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,206
You don't see pictures of police,
beating my brains in.

410
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:11,212
You don't see that.
But I see that. That's what I see.

411
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,317
We have seen what they did
to Rodney King.

412
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,459
The whole world has seen
what happened to Rodney King.

413
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,220
Baby, let me show you what
they did to Tupac Shakur.

414
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,864
All that movie, that didn't
mean nothing to OPD.

415
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,092
I was still an N-l-G-G-A,
and they proved it.

416
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,202
And if you can see this,
Mr. Cameraman,

417
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,237
- This is scars I'll go to my grave with.
- I can see it.

418
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,341
These are
"learn to be a nigger" scars.

419
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,443
- You're suing them?
- For ten mil.

420
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:43,739
What else can I do? See what
happens. You know how that go.

421
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:48,578
Rodney King's still fighting for his, and
they got it on tape. They got it on tape.

422
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,278
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society

423
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,481
Why did you lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality

424
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,660
- They settled with me.
- They did?

425
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,592
They gave me 42,000.
I had to pay my lawyer a whole bunch

426
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,357
and bought a car.

427
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,892
I settled
because I was tired of court.

428
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,334
I could have won more,
but I was tired of going to court.

429
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,303
I felt like any dollar from any police
department was good money.

430
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,344
- So you got $42,000 for jaywalking?
- That's a hell of a ticket.

431
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,346
After that case,
people perceived me as a menace.

432
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,214
I've had chief of police, vice president,

433
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:27,255
the leader of the
Black National Women's Council...

434
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:31,527
Everybody against me.
Why? Why me?

435
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,264
I have not brought violence to you. I
have not brought Thug Life to America.

436
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,233
I didn't create Thug Life.
I diagnosed it.

437
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,335
What's up?

438
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,569
When I did Juice,
my image got even more scary.

439
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,839
Everything starts from now.

440
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,017
We all go down
unless we stay together.

441
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,379
No one's above the crew.
You know that shit.

442
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,182
You're crazy, man.

443
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,789
When I auditioned for Juice,
that was another good-luck time.

444
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:06,259
It was my first big part, and I just
took everything and internalized it.

445
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,295
You're right.

446
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,826
I am crazy.

447
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,265
But you know what else?

448
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,766
I don't give a fuck.

449
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,942
Bishop is a psychopath,
but more true to his character,

450
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,945
Bishop is a lonely,
misguided, young kid.

451
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:31,244
His heroes are James Cagney
and Scarface, those kind of guys.

452
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:36,120
- Made it, Ma. Top of the world.
- "Made it, Ma. Top of the world."

453
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,763
Know what I'm saying, "shoot them
up, go out in a blaze" type gangsters.

454
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,297
If you've gotta go out,
that's how you go out.

455
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,527
That motherfucker took his destiny
in his own hands.

456
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:54,371
When I get a part, at first I just try to
find out, how does this character feel?

457
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,911
Like, I make
the person up in my mind.

458
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,947
What he looks like,
try to put a face to him.

459
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:06,317
Even though it's my face, I'll give
him a walk and give him an attitude.

460
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:08,822
All you have to do
is relate to your character.

461
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,724
Even away from the set I just let
myself go. I just stopped caring.

462
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,161
I stopped worrying
about what people thought

463
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:20,030
and started staring people down more.
I really just got into the part.

464
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,771
- Yo, Bishop, man, give me the piece.
- No.

465
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,499
No? What the hell you mean, no?
Give me the gun.

466
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:28,110
I mean I'm holding onto this
till I say so.

467
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,144
I'm not playing.

468
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,838
Oh, really?

469
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,581
When I'm playing a character,
I'm really that character.

470
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,414
There's nothing fake.

471
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,355
Oh, shit!

472
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,117
I just took everything
and internalized it.

473
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,760
Tell us about your character.
I know you're the villain.

474
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:53,302
Yo, I play me, straight ruthless villain,
straight killer, straight take no sszzz-s.

475
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,371
You know what I'm saying?
Straight popping partners.

476
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,439
Yo, Tupac will go ahead
and rock this.

477
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,078
Juice helped me
because it gave me that trust.

478
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,009
It let me trust my instincts.

479
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:09,278
I was confident about what I could do
and what it would look like afterwards.

480
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,753
My next guest has not only become
one of today's most talented new stars,

481
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,985
but he's becoming one of today's
most talked about new stars.

482
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,131
Please welcome Tupac Shakur.

483
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,790
I know what I feel like when
I'm in the zone, when I'm there.

484
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,733
So I was just trying
to get that feeling.

485
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,298
Why are you always so mad?

486
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,672
The exciting performance in the film
is the one of Tupac Shakur.

487
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,981
What do you want from me?

488
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,950
I think you're kind of fly. Shit.

489
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,347
We could start
with your phone number.

490
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,819
This is a 22-year-old young actor,
Tupac Shakur.

491
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,426
He's been in the film Juice,
and I hope to see him again soon.

492
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:58,328
When I was doing Poetic Justice, I had
to tone myself down a lot to be Lucky.

493
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:02,300
Lucky is doing the opposite of Bishop.
He's working, responsible,

494
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,408
deliberate about things,
caring for his daughter.

495
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:08,178
I'm a Gemini, so I got both sides.

496
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:12,210
See, I get a feeling
there are two Tupacs.

497
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:16,376
See, I mean, you're this kind,
sensitive, friendly guy,

498
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,112
yet you're involved
in so much controversy.

499
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:22,190
I'm talking about Tupac Shakur,
who had an incident

500
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,226
with a limo driver
during a taping of In Living Color.

501
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,561
Tupac Shakur is free on bond tonight
after his arrest this weekend in Atlanta.

502
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,669
The 22-year-old singer and actor
was charged with shooting

503
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,429
two off-duty police officers.

504
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,232
The wounds were not serious.

505
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,376
The fight that led to the shooting
in Marin City

506
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,772
reportedly broke out in this field
on Saturday night.

507
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,072
Marin Festival USA was in full swing.

508
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,877
Neighbors say Tupac should not
have let anyone bring a gun here.

509
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,486
Since he got big,
they claim he's changed.

510
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,781
That change has broken some hearts.

511
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,925
Tupac was homeless.
He's from here. We helped him out.

512
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,529
Over my career,
I got arrested, like, 12 times,

513
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,528
some by mistake, some fate
and some unwarranted.

514
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,464
But for whatever reason, I got
to see police more than I wanted to.

515
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,469
In some of my cases,
they dropped the charges.

516
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:12,199
But because of trouble
in these court cases,

517
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,846
it was hard at that point
for me to be trying to do a movie.

518
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,607
I wasn't professional.
I think I was talented,

519
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,944
but I didn't have the concentration.
And I was immature,

520
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,018
and my ego was out of control.

521
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,623
Harry Connick ain't got nothing on me.
Check it.

522
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,259
I had to get humble again
before I could do this.

523
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,261
More hot water may await Tupac,

524
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,526
based on what he tells
the new issue of The Source

525
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:42,536
about costarring with Janet Jackson
in her film debut, Poetic Justice.

526
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,968
Among other complaints,

527
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,303
Tupac says Janet's people
asked him to take an AIDS test

528
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,380
- Before shooting a love scene.
- I don't know if it came from Janet,

529
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:55,484
but suddenly they wanted me to take
an AIDS test for this love scene.

530
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:58,587
I did not disagree if we were
really gonna make love.

531
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,917
I said, "If we can make love,
I'll take four AIDS tests."

532
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,584
But if I'm doing a love scene with her
just like somebody else did,

533
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,821
and they didn't take a test,
I'm not.

534
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:11,866
Not only am I not taking a test,
but get out of my trailer.

535
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,527
And they sent, like, four
different people to ask me.

536
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,803
First they sent the producer, then
the black dude, then John, then a girl.

537
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,845
It don't matter who you send,
I'm not taking one.

538
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,950
To me, it was just like an insult.
We had a good experience on the set.

539
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:31,417
- You look like the type of guy to care.
- What's the type?

540
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:35,683
I thought I made a friend. I thought,
"I know Janet Jackson for life."

541
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,727
When the movie was over, it was like,
"This number has been changed."

542
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:45,870
And it was like a movie. I mean, it was
like the day after the movie wrapped.

543
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,095
"I'm gonna call you."
"All right."

544
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,242
"This number's been changed."
I said, "Oh, OK."

545
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:57,478
Still, when I see her again, I'd run up
and hug her. We was real cool.

546
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:06,547
I love women. I'm not gonna lie.
I love women with a passion. I do. I do.

547
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:10,022
Sometimes I just wanna call Prince
and be like, "Can we hang?"

548
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,220
Because I love women
like he love women.

549
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,400
Hold on. I've been talking
to little girls all day.

550
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,592
Seeing somebody my age.
How you doing?

551
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,600
- Fine, how you doing?
- Yourself?

552
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,332
I have ultra respect for women.
I like being around females,

553
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,737
I'm comfortable with them
on every level.

554
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:30,471
I don't get a predator thing going
when I'm around demure females.

555
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,673
- Don't be shy.
- Y'all making me blush.

556
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,579
You got me blushing.

557
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,946
I'm not uncomfortable
around strong women.

558
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,091
- Sorry. I'm not enough.
- No, I'm looking you up and down.

559
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,921
On TV, they'll go,
"Look how he looking at Tabitha."

560
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,528
Don't do that.

561
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:07,750
Madonna is real nice. She's a good
person. She helped me a lot.

562
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,614
She was real cool,
like any one of my homeboys.

563
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,517
Jasmine Guy, she helped me.
She's a good supporter.

564
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:16,488
Jada Pinkett. Jada's my heart,
you know what I mean?

565
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:19,458
She will be my friend
for my whole life.

566
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:23,259
Well, I'll scoop you up later in life
if you ain't all shriveled up.

567
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,463
We'll be old together.
Be like Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.

568
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,141
Pic, you always
got a place in my heart.

569
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,278
She can have my one heart,
my liver, my lungs, my kidneys,

570
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,003
my blood, marrow, all of that.

571
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,806
Keep your head up

572
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:42,213
Child, things are gonna get easier

573
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,359
- Keep your head up
- Child, things will get brighter

574
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,586
My mother taught me to understand
women a lot more than my peers can.

575
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:56,289
When I was young,
I was surrounded by strong women.

576
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,328
My sister's the bomb.
She's my biggest critic.

577
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,803
She's real smart, funny as all hell.
She's real funny.

578
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,568
My mother was a matriarch.
If you raised by a woman,

579
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,211
you're gonna think like a woman.

580
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,382
Since we all came from a woman,
Got our name from a woman

581
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,574
And our game from a woman

582
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,582
I wonder why we take
From our women

583
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:20,348
Why we rape our women
Do we hate our women?

584
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:24,050
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women

585
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,922
Be real to our women

586
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,530
But I'm not a woman.
I'm just a normal man.

587
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,635
To me, I'm the hardest man around,
the hardest nigga, because I'm real.

588
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,432
But I'm also very soft.

589
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,370
I'm very sensitive, but that's why I'm
so harsh, because I'm so sensitive.

590
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,243
And that's what I think
has made me successful and famous.

591
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,908
So sensitive.
Don't be so sensitive, Tupac.

592
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,585
- Well, basically...
- Bugaloo.

593
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,520
Bugaloo? Boogaloo?

594
00:39:55,726 --> 00:40:00,129
Marlon Wayans,
I am playing the role of Bugaloo.

595
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,323
- What is Bugaloo?
- Where did that name come from?

596
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,903
Some white guy's sitting there, "What's
a homeboy hip-hop name? Bugaloo!"

597
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,539
"What are they calling each other
these days?"

598
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,904
- Check it out
- I get around

599
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,171
- What you mean you don't know?
- Round and round, round we go

600
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,508
I get around

601
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,777
The Underground just don't stop
For ho's. I get around

602
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,888
When I got famous,
I got famous friends.

603
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,254
Mickey Rourke was a good friend,
good person. He's really funny.

604
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:34,192
My memory of him is the night
he's arguing with Carrי, his wife.

605
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:38,164
He didn't know what to do.
I was like, "Man, buy her some Cristal.

606
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,099
"Cristal will make someone
forgive you, trust me."

607
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,569
They be like,
"What was we fighting about?"

608
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:48,274
He's like, "That's a good idea, 'Pac."
I was like, "He gotta be twice my age,

609
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:49,844
"and I'm giving him ideas."

610
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:55,616
Ain't no party like a Thug Life party
Because a Thug Life party don't stop

611
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,257
Ain't no party like a Thug Life party
Because a Thug Life party don't stop

612
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:06,294
Ain't no party like a Thug Life party
Because a Thug Life party don't stop

613
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,399
I always gave Biggie a lot of props.
The Notorious B.I.G.

614
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,694
I thought at the time
he was my friend.

615
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:19,367
Mike Tyson, we used to kick it.
He's a real cool brother, a big brother.

616
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,705
The only difference in us
is that he's big and I'm small.

617
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:26,610
But I got the same heart he got.
I want to knock everybody out.

618
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,012
My brother, I'm telling you,
you were good.

619
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,122
- I enjoyed your performance.
- Appreciate it. Thank you very much.

620
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,885
I like that people come to me
and go, "You did a good job."

621
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,393
I was loving that somebody said,
"Tupac, you a great actor."

622
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,295
- I'm telling you, Tupac a real nigga.
- Being famous gave me confidence.

623
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,836
- Is Tupac a sexy motherfucker?
- The crowd gave me confidence.

624
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,530
- Go Tupac, go Tupac, go.
- Let me hear you say:

625
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:56,042
- "Go Thug Life, go Thug Life, go."
- Go Thug Life, go Thug Life, go.

626
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,909
That's what I wanna hear.
Now, I'm my own man.

627
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,341
I got you now! I got you now!

628
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:04,646
I put it down. I wanna get
into the head seat. Excel at it.

629
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,823
Do it one more time,
clear as possible.

630
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,015
Can we double it,
see what it sound like?

631
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,716
I'm a natural-born leader.

632
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,489
If not, everybody lose their jobs.
Everybody lose their jobs!

633
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,667
Back to servant.
Playing the drums in the corner.

634
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:22,433
But nobody could call me a sellout.
I'm not going for that.

635
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,400
I didn't want to change.

636
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,205
I loved that even though I was
with Janet Jackson in big movies,

637
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,110
I'll be up at the dirtiest
house party in the 'hood.

638
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,444
Damn, sweetheart
You got some thighs on you

639
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:39,111
Now I can't wait to get you home
Get you all alone in my bedroom

640
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,417
People could not believe it.
I used to thrive off that.

641
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:46,727
Being up in the party, and somebody
go, "Oh, my God, that's Tupac."

642
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:50,064
Going crazy because I'm
in a dirty party, no security,

643
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,600
lights out, drinking, hella drunk.
Drunk with everybody else.

644
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:57,865
But that's what kept my sanity,
kept me right, kept me going.

645
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,806
My fans know that I'm real.
My fans go to jail just like me.

646
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,981
They understand me.
Half my fans are white.

647
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,946
The white fans listen
as much as the black fans.

648
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,815
The ones that have approached me
have been genuine fans.

649
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:16,186
These people will have jobs in
the future and will hire my family.

650
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,626
Get down, man!

651
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:27,170
But many of my fans don't have ID.
Some have jobs, some don't.

652
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,067
Some are on welfare, you know?
Some are not.

653
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,969
Some are rich and some are poor,

654
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:36,977
but they all share that hopeless feeling.
I got the underdogs on my side.

655
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,582
Body bags of adversaries
That I had to bury

656
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:47,087
I'm almost more in awe of the people
in awe of me than they are of me.

657
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:51,250
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw

658
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:55,125
Everybody just be screaming,
and I get uncomfortable.

659
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,463
It's similar to a deer
caught in the headlights.

660
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:02,969
It's like a battle to find the right words
to say at the right time.

661
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,274
I live Thug Life
And let the money come to me

662
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,107
Because they could never take
The game from a young G

663
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,646
I'm getting money

664
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,650
It was cool. I got to speak to young
black males all over the country

665
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,119
about this new idea
called "Thug Life"...

666
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,856
...which is a new kind
of Black Power.

667
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,324
When I say, "Thug Life",
I mean that shit

668
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:28,225
because these white folks
see us as thugs.

669
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,334
I don't care if you think you a lawyer,
a man, an African-American.

670
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:34,766
If you whatever the fuck
you think you are,

671
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,270
we thugs and niggas
to these motherfuckers!

672
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,136
Until we own some shit,
I'll call it like it is.

673
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,710
How you gonna be a man
and we starving?

674
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:44,744
Walk about five different houses,

675
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:48,008
there ain't a man in either one
of them motherfuckers.

676
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,346
How we gonna be African-Americans
if we all need a gun?

677
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:54,319
We thugs and niggas
until we set this shit right.

678
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,390
Trust me when I tell you that shit.

679
00:44:56,593 --> 00:45:00,256
Young black males identify with
Thug Life, but I couldn't handle it.

680
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,864
I could handle it, but not right away.

681
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,127
- Mr. Shakur, can we get a comment?
- Hell, no. Thug Life.

682
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:09,032
- Pardon me?
- Thug Life. That's my comment.

683
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,764
What's that mean? I don't understand.

684
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,378
- What did happen?
- Thug Life.

685
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:20,676
Imagine you have 14,000 people
ready to do whatever you want.

686
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:26,413
You have, all over the country, people
waiting to hear what you wanna do.

687
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:32,559
I got people in the penitentiary,
bigtime OG criminals, calling me,

688
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,891
telling me they want me
to lead their movement.

689
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,398
I mean, I'm gonna have a problem.

690
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,667
So they told me to watch my language.

691
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,101
Fuck that.

692
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:51,042
I'm gonna have a small identity crisis.
I felt like, "I got every man in America

693
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:55,048
"who wants to take orders from me,
who wants to know what I wanna do."

694
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,153
Holler if you hear me
Pump, pump if you're pissed

695
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:02,257
Wants to know my plan for young
black males. That makes me scared.

696
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,484
My homeys in the back streets
The black streets

697
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,220
They fear me when they rolling
In they phat jeeps

698
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,331
This ain't just a rap song
A black song

699
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,764
Telling my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle

700
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,905
Hustling to the other brother's bubble
Holler if you hear me

701
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,334
And I'm 22.

702
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,772
I was having concerts sold out,
white boys, Mexicans, blacks,

703
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:24,505
and they would do what I say.
I could tell them to turn in a circle,

704
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,842
and they would do it.
I was having love,

705
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,610
like, undeniable love,
and I was scared.

706
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,185
Holler if you hear me

707
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,019
I was scared, but so was America,
so was somebody else.

708
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:40,261
- I'm a liberal Democrat.
- I'm a conservative Republican,

709
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,456
but we both worry about
the society our children live in.

710
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,502
But that makes me want
to rise to the occasion.

711
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,536
It makes me want
to give my whole life to it.

712
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,608
And I will give my whole life to
this plan that I have for Thug Life.

713
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,109
That's my new posse,
my new way of thinking.

714
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,804
That's how we rolling in the nine-three,
Thug Life.

715
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,782
By "thug", I mean, not criminal,
someone that beats you.

716
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,215
I mean, the underdog.

717
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,913
The person that had nothing
and succeeds is a thug

718
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,820
because he overcame all obstacles.

719
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,757
It has nothing to do
with the dictionary's version.

720
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,865
To me, thug is my pride, not being
someone that goes against the law,

721
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,833
not being someone that takes,
but being someone that has nothing,

722
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:25,202
and even though I have nothing and
no home to go to, my head is up high.

723
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:29,004
My chest is out. I walk tall.
I talk loud. I'm being strong.

724
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:33,343
I'm against racial, ethnic entitlements.
I think they are un-American.

725
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,820
I don't understand why America
doesn't get Thug Life.

726
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,683
America is Thug Life.

727
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:42,916
How is me saying,
"I don't give a fuck,"

728
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:47,586
different than Patrick Henry saying,
"Give me liberty or give me death"?

729
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:53,399
What makes my freedom
less worth fighting for than Bosnians

730
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,164
or whoever they wanna
fight for this year?

731
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,173
They should give money to the ghetto.

732
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:04,541
Even gangs can be positive.
It just has to be organized.

733
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:08,878
It has to steer away from being self-
destructive to being self-productive.

734
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:13,311
I organized the OGs on the East
and West Coasts in penitentiaries

735
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,356
to come up with
codes of ethics for criminals.

736
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,357
It's called the Code of Thug Life.

737
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,554
It's a code, putting order
to the violence on the streets.

738
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,734
In Watts, Compton,
Chicago, wherever.

739
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,870
People all over the country say,
"We go by this code.

740
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:31,666
"We're against attacks on people
not involved with the street gang,

741
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,343
"the drug trade
or the illegal business at all.

742
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,911
"All that kidnapping and shooting
drive-bys, we against that."

743
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,913
Thug Life ain't just a bunch
of niggas going crazy.

744
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:43,712
We wanna patrol our streets.
So all we saying is,

745
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:47,186
if every motherfucker out here
right now gave up one dollar

746
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,155
to this Thug Life fund,
the money don't go to me,

747
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,885
it go to somebody
from y'all neighborhood,

748
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,156
and we do this shit every month.
I'll bring new rappers,

749
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:58,300
I'll bring Snoop,
whoever y'all want.

750
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,665
I'll go snatch them niggas.

751
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,363
For that shit to happen,
we can't have violence,

752
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,236
and everybody gotta be down
for that shit.

753
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,276
We gonna start slowly but surely
taking our communities back.

754
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:15,281
Regulate our community. Organize.
Start taking care of our own.

755
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,114
We gotta start somewhere, and I don't
know about anything but this.

756
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:23,453
- What is the message, though?
- All the people you threw away,

757
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,426
the dope dealers, criminals, they
will be legit next to you in first class,

758
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,861
thanks to your boy.

759
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,860
You know those
little things for mice,

760
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,597
where they go through
and there's little blocks?

761
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,298
Well, society is like that.

762
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:43,502
They'll let you go as far as you want,
but when you ask too many questions

763
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:48,208
and you're ready to change,
boom, that block'll come.

764
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,948
There is no reason
for a record like this

765
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,492
to be published
by a responsible corporation.

766
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,859
Never before has there been
such a will to use music

767
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,365
to advertise self-destructive violence.

768
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:10,472
It glorifies violence. It's creating
a culture of guns and rape.

769
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,507
Adding insult to injury, she says,
is rapper Tupac Shakur

770
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,406
being nominated
for an NAACP lmage Award.

771
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,844
I got the whole world fearing me,
and I ain't even started.

772
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,712
I don't have my plan,
and they're trying to stop me.

773
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:26,514
I challenge the view that those
who revel in violence and depravity,

774
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:29,453
on the screen or in the song,
bear no responsibility

775
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,854
when that spirit spreads
into our culture.

776
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,429
No disrespect to Bob Dole.
He don't know what he talking about.

777
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:39,796
He's just talking. Some card somebody
gave him, he's just reading off a card.

778
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,805
But he's cute, you know?
He's my grandfather.

779
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,532
- Right.
- He's an old dude, talking mess.

780
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,235
You don't have to use
vile and ugly language.

781
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:54,845
WPGC in Washington, D.C.
dropped violent or demeaning lyrics.

782
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,543
KACE in Los Angeles followed suit.

783
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:01,554
You're yelling, "Shoot!" in a community
that is crowded with guns.

784
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:06,058
I'm not looking for approval from the
black community. We are a part of it.

785
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,391
I'm a thug, and I rap about
the oppressed fighting back.

786
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,803
Yes, my raps are filled with rage.

787
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:19,409
You have to be logical. You know?
If I know that in this hotel room

788
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,867
You have to be logical. You know?
If I know that in this hotel room

789
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,414
they have food every day, and I'm
knocking on the door every day to eat,

790
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,381
and they open the door,
let me see the party,

791
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,147
let me see them
throwing salami all over,

792
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:37,520
I mean, just throwing food around,
but they're telling me there's no food.

793
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:42,323
Every day, I'm standing outside
trying to sing my way in.

794
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:46,366
We are hungry, please let us in
We are hungry, please let us in

795
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,004
After about a week that song
is gonna change to:

796
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,174
We hungry, we need some food

797
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,501
After two, three weeks, it's like:

798
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,008
Give me the food
Or I'm breaking down the door

799
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,771
After a year you're just like:

800
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,144
I'm picking the lock
Coming through the door blasting

801
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,819
It's like, you hungry,
you reached your level.

802
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,921
We asked ten years ago.
We was asking with the Panthers.

803
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,855
We was asking with them, the Civil
Rights Movement. We was asking.

804
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,552
Those people that asked
are dead and in jail.

805
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,859
So now what do you think
we're gonna do? Ask?

806
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:22,732
I put my gun away and grab my AK
It's getting hectic, I can't call it

807
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:27,342
House full of alcoholics
Now we're niggas under pressure

808
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,549
There's a bad part because
kids see that and mimic you.

809
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,984
I haven't figured that out yet.
But the positive side

810
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:40,623
is the kids who live in a house
where the mother is a crackhead,

811
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,122
he hears the rap. He's like,
"That's every day.

812
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:47,194
"So I don't have to feel ashamed."
It cuts both ways.

813
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:49,262
To me, it's like, when I sing:

814
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:52,367
I live the Thug Life
Baby, I'm hopeless

815
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,936
One person might hear that
and just like the way it sounds.

816
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:01,236
But I'm doing it for the kid that lives
a Thug Life and feels like it's hopeless.

817
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:06,905
So when I say, "Hopeless", and when
I say it like that, it's like I reach him.

818
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,051
And even if, when I reach him,

819
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:13,120
it makes it look glorious
to the guy that doesn't live that life,

820
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:16,622
I can't help it. It's a fad.
He'll drop the Thug Life soon.

821
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:21,263
But for the person I tried to reach, he'll
pick it up, and I'll be able to talk to him.

822
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:23,364
I try to be responsible,
but it's hard.

823
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:26,627
If you worry about what you're saying,
I get writer's block.

824
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:30,363
Kind of like, "I can't say that.
That's too harsh. Can't say this."

825
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:34,567
I have to block it out and trust
my heart that I'm doing the right thing.

826
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,212
Pretty spit...
I was spitting.

827
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,942
- Chill out. Chill out.
- That's my style. That's my new style.

828
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:45,280
- That's my new style.
- 'Pac, chill out.

829
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:48,013
That's my new style.

830
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,024
Hey, have a good summer.

831
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,795
Have a good summer, bitch!

832
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,365
But I'm not saying
I didn't make mistakes.

833
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:02,868
Like some of the things I said when
I was fighting the Hughes brothers.

834
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,476
I beat up the directors
to Menace II Society.

835
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:13,047
- All right, tell them why you did that.
- These chump, punk, slump...

836
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,686
- You'll be able to rebuttal to that.
- No, they better come now.

837
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:20,322
Check this out, they fired me
in a roundabout, punk, snitch way.

838
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,788
So I caught them on the streets
and beat they behinds.

839
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,827
I was a menace to the
Hughes brothers. It ain't over!

840
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:30,466
I still got more for you chumps!
I read what you said about me!

841
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,465
I'm gonna kick their ass!

842
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,729
My big mouth.

843
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,170
Mind y'all business, I'll mind mine.
I do what I gotta do,

844
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,402
you do what you gotta do.
Long as I give you 12 tracks,

845
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:45,945
you give me my $12, and we even.
I don't gotta be a role model.

846
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:49,607
I don't gotta hold your hand.
I don't gotta do shit.

847
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,947
My big mouth.
I got a big mouth, can't help it.

848
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:56,182
- I talk from my heart, I'm real.
- We talked about

849
00:54:56,393 --> 00:55:01,092
people in this business that you feel
don't have a love for their own people.

850
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:05,758
We was talking about
Spike Lee, Arsenio Hall,

851
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,267
Eddie Murphy and the rest of them.

852
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,635
I thought I was charming, but I was
immature. I did things without thinking.

853
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,174
Michael Jackson, Randy Jackson,

854
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:17,812
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul,
all of them.

855
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,482
She wants to not be black,
but sell to blacks.

856
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:25,553
I don't appreciate her going
out of her way to say she's not black.

857
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:29,885
My actions came before thought.
Things that I did, things I said.

858
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,720
So many things I wanna take back.

859
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:36,058
Eddie Murphy, with all that dough he's
making, hasn't done nothing for us.

860
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:39,429
- He does a lot of charity.
- Charity doesn't get to the ghetto.

861
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:40,864
Everybody knows that.

862
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,005
I was young and dumb.

863
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:46,198
Being mad at Spike Lee
and all those people, all of that.

864
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,304
The thing I said of Quincy Jones,

865
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,308
he shouldn't mess
with white women.

866
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,572
I said I was sorry personally for that.

867
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,875
I didn't think of how
it would hurt people.

868
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:59,146
I'm gonna catch y'all in traffic and
be the roughest nigga you ever seen.

869
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,221
That turned into
more legal problems.

870
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:05,258
The People truly believe that
Mr. Shakur has shown no remorse

871
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,226
whatsoever for his action in this case.

872
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:12,765
We view Mr. Shakur's appearance
on Yo! MTV Raps as bragging.

873
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,029
He was proud of what he did
and does not feel sorry.

874
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,733
I just want to say, judge,
that I have a great deal of remorse.

875
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:24,004
As far as I want you to treat
me different, I don't want that.

876
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,878
I just want the chance to make right
from all the bad things that I got.

877
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:32,077
I got things against me
and people that look up to me.

878
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:35,052
I don't want the last place
they see me to be jail.

879
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,425
I guess it's now time
for me to render the sentence.

880
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:42,189
I obviously find that the defendant
is a talented individual.

881
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,529
However, this court believes that jail
time is warranted with a battery

882
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,499
with some injury involved.

883
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,765
The defendant will serve 15 days
in the county jail.

884
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,465
I think the judge was fair.

885
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,668
I still don't feel like I got
the decision that I wanted,

886
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,110
but he was as fair as he could be.

887
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:03,081
Really, to my homeboys, I mean,
a fight is a fight, battery is battery.

888
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:07,484
A two and a half minute problem
just cost me 15 days in jail,

889
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,021
and that was lenient.

890
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:12,786
But my most serious legal problems
came from women.

891
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,762
How I was acting with women.

892
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:19,696
The Underground just don't stop
For ho's, I get around

893
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:24,237
I will no longer sit passively,
allowing this degradation

894
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,239
to be continued by our children.

895
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,413
I think we live in a very sexist society,

896
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,309
and everybody's pointing
the finger at me.

897
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:37,145
When somebody asks me,
"Do you exploit women?"

898
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,982
With her permission, I might
smack a girl on the butt in the video.

899
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,854
I might be drinking champagne,
but everything in moderation,

900
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,585
and everything with class.

901
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,254
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip

902
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,493
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips

903
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,672
See me jocking, put a little twist
In her hips because I'm watching

904
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,535
I don't have to always do a song
with the good woman.

905
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,439
I don't see women as all one thing.
I think all women are different.

906
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:07,976
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch

907
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:11,278
We African-American
women, particularly,

908
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:17,484
are tired of being called ho's,
bitches and sluts by our children.

909
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:20,891
Dear Ms. DeLores Tucker
You keep stressing me

910
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:24,794
Fucking with a motherfucking mind
I figured you wanted to know

911
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,832
Why we call them ho's bitches

912
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,505
If I do something that has a bad
woman, people go, "He hates women."

913
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,837
If I do something that has a bad
woman, people go, "He hates women."

914
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,874
I don't think like that. But there
are definitely a type of female,

915
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:38,343
label them a bitch, whose main thing
is to get what they can,

916
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:42,382
and they revel in breaking a nigga's
heart and taking what he owns.

917
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:43,813
Shut the fuck up!

918
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,011
There's male bitches too.

919
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,680
Women know there are bitches.
I don't know why they're surprised.

920
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,623
They know. They say it louder.

921
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:56,663
They think we say they're all bitches.
That's not what we're saying.

922
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,198
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare

923
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:01,563
Tupac cares
And don't nobody else care

924
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,001
That's "Keep Ya Head Up"
and "Get Around".

925
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,404
I said, "I'm gonna write a song
about women like my mom,

926
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:10,443
"who represent a strong
black woman." I did that.

927
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,343
I'll rap about women I see daily.
That's "Get Around".

928
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,986
If I just did "Keep Ya Head Up",
it makes me seem more than I am,

929
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,983
but I'm just a normal man.

930
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:23,648
America, America

931
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:30,060
- God shed his grace on thee
- Stop.

932
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:32,598
I'm gonna close the door.

933
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,532
Come on, Mr. Cameraman.

934
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:41,734
This is some real private shit that's
about to happen, Mr. Cameraman.

935
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,378
Bye.

936
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,707
Anyway, I'll let you hear the sounds.

937
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,078
Is there a double standard
for men being promiscuous?

938
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,947
Yeah, but we didn't start
that double standard.

939
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:55,420
- I'm not saying you did.
- And I'm not saying it's fair.

940
00:59:55,625 --> 01:00:00,062
I'm saying this is how it is. How can we
rap about a world that is not like that?

941
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,754
- This is how it is.
- Do you look down on males

942
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,298
if they're as promiscuous as women?

943
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:08,026
I don't look down on anybody
that's promiscuous.

944
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,434
I only look down on people
who don't control the situation.

945
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:14,633
If a girl sleeps with a lot of guys,
she's still my homegirl.

946
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:17,677
You're only a bitch, not if you
sleep with a lot of guys,

947
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,973
but if you're sleeping
with them for money.

948
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:23,550
- So you put a price on yourself.
- Because they have a nice car.

949
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,415
Guys, when they sleep around,
they do it for free.

950
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:32,057
At that time, a lot of girls, they'd seen
my face on TV so many times,

951
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:35,025
they wanna be associated
with that person.

952
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:38,632
It's the fame that gets these people.
It's not me. It's the fame.

953
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:41,770
I've seen females look at
me when they didn't know me,

954
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,962
and I can see it, nothing.

955
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:47,199
Then someone whisper who I was,
it's this glare in the eye.

956
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,811
- You make yourself want them.
- How do you feel about that?

957
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:54,177
I don't understand how people can
stand next to you one year,

958
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:58,480
and next year, they cannot.
They're going crazy, screaming.

959
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:02,988
They can't take it that you're there.
But last year I was in the same club,

960
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,456
walking around,
lonely like a motherfucker.

961
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,189
Couldn't get a date or a dance.
I was too skinny, too something,

962
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:12,732
and now, "He's just adorable.
He's just, oh!"

963
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,568
But I still enjoyed sex without
the emotional connection.

964
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:24,037
And it was always a fantasy
for me to have sex

965
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,306
with a lot of people in the room.

966
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,811
But I didn't play
one situation correctly.

967
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,188
Rap singer Tupac Shakur was
released on $50,000 bail today,

968
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,224
accused of a sexual attack
in a New York hotel.

969
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,829
The singer was arrested Thursday
night after a woman claimed

970
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,398
he and three other men
overpowered her in a hotel suite.

971
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:49,833
- Are you disappointing your fans?
- Very, but they're gonna support me.

972
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:54,839
With bodyguards and attorneys, he
went into Manhattan Criminal Court.

973
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,980
There, the rapper and two friends were
charged with first-degree sodomy.

974
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,673
The allegations stem
from an incident last Thursday

975
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,011
in which a woman claims
she was held down

976
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,586
as he and two others
allegedly sodomized her.

977
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,917
The allegations by this
young lady are without merit.

978
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,095
Defense attorneys say the woman
went there consensually,

979
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,423
and answering machine tapes
that indicate

980
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:18,930
her interest in Shakur
were erased by police.

981
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:24,130
OK, so you tell me when your
lawyers have asked you to stop.

982
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:28,174
The girl who claims that...

983
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,639
What does she claim?

984
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,280
- I can't even say it, man.
- OK.

985
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,950
But technically, it's a rape case.

986
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,119
I wasn't convicted of no rape charge.

987
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,552
My charge was sexual abuse,
forcibly touching the buttocks.

988
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,421
I have a female saying that...
I can't say it, but...

989
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,755
It just bothers me so much,
you know?

990
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,990
To go through my life
and everything I did, coming out

991
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,293
of a family and household
with just women,

992
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:58,304
to get to this point to have a woman
say that I took something from her.

993
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,975
It was hard.

994
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:06,610
It was an emotional day
for a 20-year-old female fan,

995
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:10,377
who admitted that she had consensual
sex with Shakur on Sunday night,

996
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,578
four days before her alleged rape
in the hotel room.

997
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,021
During her cross-examination,
defense attorney Michael Warren

998
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:22,289
painted a picture of a starstruck, naive
girl anxious to have sex with Shakur.

999
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:26,491
Word is, you had a relationship with
this woman prior to all this friction.

1000
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:30,297
If you can say that's a relationship.
I bumped in a club. I seen her.

1001
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:33,304
Let's use a clinical term.
There was oral copulation?

1002
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:36,672
Yeah, she performed oral sex
on the dance floor.

1003
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,843
A lot of guys could say
what they wouldn't do

1004
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:43,041
and what they would do,
but when it happens, you know...?

1005
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:46,483
- Yeah.
- It just goes down. And it's... Really.

1006
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:57,622
She did some things there at the club,
and we got together later that night.

1007
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:01,600
I saw her again another time with
these guys that introduced me to her.

1008
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:05,900
Everybody was having a good time,
nothing sexual, just a good time.

1009
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:09,669
Me and her went in, she gave me
a massage, went to sleep, woke up,

1010
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,848
she's screaming,
"Rape, rape." I raped her.

1011
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:17,179
And she's yelling at me, "This is not
the last you're gonna see of me."

1012
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,816
I'm cursing her out because I'm not
thinking she's really gonna do that.

1013
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,390
And the next thing I know,
I'm going to jail.

1014
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:27,927
In your opinion there was no truth
to the sexual abuse charges?

1015
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,722
Not on my part at all.

1016
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,966
The defense pounded away at her,

1017
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:36,229
asking her why she didn't scream for
help at the time of the alleged attack.

1018
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,340
The woman testified
that Shakur's friends said:

1019
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,943
"Tupac needs his fans.
Don't go to the White Man with this.

1020
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,546
"Millions of girls would love
to be in your shoes right now."

1021
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,182
What about your cronies?

1022
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:52,218
That was a big misconception.
The people with me weren't friends.

1023
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:55,390
- Why were they in your room?
- I hang with lots of people.

1024
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,458
And that's how I am.
It's similar to like you said,

1025
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:02,028
about Led Zeppelin. They don't
know all of the people with them.

1026
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,461
This guy got the weed?
OK, you can kick it.

1027
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,259
Got the money?
You can kick it.

1028
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:10,565
This guy has connections to the clubs?
OK, you can kick it. I don't know him.

1029
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:14,573
But that was my fault, I had that
kind of environment around me.

1030
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:24,249
I didn't do nothing. I'm charged with
being in concert with some guys.

1031
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,080
Well, where are they at?

1032
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,688
Why me? Because I'm Tupac...

1033
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,085
I'm not mad at them.
I'm mad at the system.

1034
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,090
I don't want nobody to go to jail,

1035
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,991
but I don't wanna go
for something I didn't do.

1036
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,256
I just don't wanna be the scapegoat.

1037
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:40,264
I just couldn't believe
this was going on in my life.

1038
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:44,963
See the cameras. It wasn't like I had a
chance for justice like a normal citizen.

1039
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:50,544
Hi, Tupac. Can you tell me
how you're doing today?

1040
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:55,683
Well, I just had to listen to the
prosecution's closing argument,

1041
01:05:55,885 --> 01:06:00,413
and it was so far from the truth that it
has me drained at the end of the day.

1042
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,057
But I'm leaving it in
the hands of the jury.

1043
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:06,956
I'm learning a lot about people's
innermost fears in this trial.

1044
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,628
It's not even about my trial no more.
It's just about

1045
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,667
Ioud rap music, tattoo-having thugs.

1046
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:18,829
It's about some nightmare
that these people are having.

1047
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,610
I can't understand why it's so close.

1048
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:26,180
There's no evidence I sodomized her,
even though you put that in the paper.

1049
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,610
Print the facts so everybody
can sort it out.

1050
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:33,311
My life is ruined because nobody
has a chance to get the facts.

1051
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:35,319
Fact is, there was no semen found.

1052
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:41,326
No semen found, no forcible entry,
no entry into the anal, no nothing.

1053
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,963
I wanted to explain it.

1054
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,134
If you could go back to the night
when the abuse occurred,

1055
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,929
- Is there anything you'd do differently?
- Yeah.

1056
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,801
I would not have closed my eyes
until she was out of the room,

1057
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,170
until everybody was out of the room.

1058
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:59,007
So when you left the room
and left her with those people...

1059
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:02,275
I didn't leave her with those people
or bring her to them.

1060
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,747
- She came over?
- Right.

1061
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:06,751
She came over, knew
those people, knew everything.

1062
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,288
I just didn't grab her out of there.

1063
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,590
I'm guilty of not being a smart man,
not being a goodhearted man,

1064
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:17,823
I guess, or being more considerate.

1065
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,470
At any point, were you aware she
was involved in something she...

1066
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,503
- Cut. That's a problem right there.
- Excuse me.

1067
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,975
None of these legal matters
can be asked.

1068
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:31,169
I have a list of the stuff
you'll have to cut out. Sorry.

1069
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:35,139
- All right.
- The gentleman is out on bail.

1070
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,875
I see.

1071
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,516
I couldn't defend myself.

1072
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,316
This would never have happened
to anybody else.

1073
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,426
They have no evidence on me,
and it's about to come out.

1074
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,823
Now my life is over.
This is a year later.

1075
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,124
A year after the world's
been thinking I'm a rapist.

1076
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,130
The whole world
owes me an apology.

1077
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,395
I went through it and didn't
kill myself like Kurt Cobain.

1078
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,403
And I should, because this is
some crazy madness.

1079
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:12,047
Central, I got a black male
shot at 48th and 7th.

1080
01:08:15,454 --> 01:08:19,049
Last night, just after midnight,
at 723 7th Avenue,

1081
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:22,091
that's between 48th and 49th Street,

1082
01:08:22,294 --> 01:08:26,697
rap star Tupac Shakur and
three members of his group

1083
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:28,594
were robbed and shot.

1084
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,400
They shot me, straight up.

1085
01:08:38,610 --> 01:08:41,579
I just kept thinking,
"They really did shoot me."

1086
01:08:42,214 --> 01:08:45,672
When I wasn't dead,
immediately I was like, "Oh, man."

1087
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,545
I was like, "No, this ain't it."

1088
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:51,189
I know how it's gonna be when I die.
It's gonna be no noise.

1089
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:55,759
You ain't gonna hear people
screaming. I'm gonna fade out.

1090
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,262
And I didn't... None of that was there.

1091
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:06,466
I was like, "I got shot five times.
I'm not dead. They missed. I'm back."

1092
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,109
When Shakur resisted,
he was shot five times,

1093
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:14,108
twice in the head
and twice in the groin area.

1094
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:17,612
And his most serious wound,
a gunshot through the hand,

1095
01:09:17,816 --> 01:09:19,681
hitting an artery in his thigh.

1096
01:09:19,885 --> 01:09:23,412
He's listed in serious
but stable condition.

1097
01:09:24,723 --> 01:09:29,786
Until it happened, I really did believe
no black person would ever shoot me.

1098
01:09:30,062 --> 01:09:33,554
I believed that I didn't have to
fear my own community.

1099
01:09:33,765 --> 01:09:36,495
You know, I was like,
"I represent them.

1100
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:40,194
"I'm their ambassador to the world.
They would never do me wrong."

1101
01:09:40,405 --> 01:09:43,101
I believe that this was a robbery.

1102
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:46,937
Anybody who was gonna walk into
that building was gonna be robbed.

1103
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:50,672
The police don't wanna find out
who shot me. They're happy.

1104
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,459
As far as that Vibe interview,
just read everything over

1105
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,892
and read my reply, read their reply,
read what people say.

1106
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:11,124
Everybody that was there
knows what happened.

1107
01:10:14,973 --> 01:10:18,909
My recollection was, I was shooting
a video, the second half of "Warning",

1108
01:10:19,111 --> 01:10:22,945
which is the B-side of "Big Poppa",
and I was shooting around the block.

1109
01:10:23,148 --> 01:10:27,209
And I heard my man was up at the
studio doing a Junior M.A.F.I.A. session.

1110
01:10:27,419 --> 01:10:31,014
So I got off at the reception area,
and I saw Andre and Little Shawn.

1111
01:10:31,223 --> 01:10:34,954
I said, "What's up?" about to get on
the elevator, and he comes out shot.

1112
01:10:46,471 --> 01:10:49,531
The Tupac article had me pissed off,
you know what I'm saying?

1113
01:10:49,741 --> 01:10:52,733
Because first of all,
he dissed my man,

1114
01:10:52,945 --> 01:10:58,008
saying he turned his back on him,
and I know for a fact it didn't happen.

1115
01:10:58,917 --> 01:11:02,284
And, like, the rumors that's spreading

1116
01:11:02,487 --> 01:11:06,548
is on some tip like we set him up.
And that's crazy.

1117
01:11:09,328 --> 01:11:12,695
As soon as he comes out shot,
me and my man try to sit him down.

1118
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:16,129
He called his mom. He asked
my man if he can roll him a blunt.

1119
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:20,465
We asked if he was all right. He's like,
"Yeah, I don't know what's going on."

1120
01:11:23,375 --> 01:11:28,938
We were just trying to comfort him.
Andre Harrell called the ambulance.

1121
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:35,009
And everybody there was
very supportive of him.

1122
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:41,885
It was just the total opposite. He
came out and everyone ran to him.

1123
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:43,994
It was nothing but love and concern.

1124
01:11:44,196 --> 01:11:48,326
They got different accounts of it,
and I'm the one with the bullet wounds.

1125
01:11:48,533 --> 01:11:51,866
I also understand that if you
was to get shot five times,

1126
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:54,835
your mind is just
completely spinning.

1127
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,304
You're real confused
about your situation.

1128
01:11:57,509 --> 01:11:59,704
It'll make you say things
you don't mean.

1129
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:04,007
I was there for the whole thing. No one
else was there for the whole thing.

1130
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:08,949
I don't know the purpose of why
the story was said in another context.

1131
01:12:09,154 --> 01:12:12,317
It's not important that others know
what happened. I said it.

1132
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:16,016
Now that I said it, it's dead.
Believe me or not, I did what I had to.

1133
01:12:16,228 --> 01:12:17,456
God knows the truth.

1134
01:12:17,696 --> 01:12:21,325
There's no religion about getting shot.
I don't want any converts.

1135
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:28,838
After getting shot, I was like,
"Shit, I don't know who to trust."

1136
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,941
In a bizarre twist of events,

1137
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:36,080
Tupac Shakur checked himself out of
Bellevue Hospital Wednesday night.

1138
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:41,742
After surgery, Tupac checked himself
out of Bellevue against doctor's orders.

1139
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:45,554
It was just time to leave.
I didn't feel safe there.

1140
01:12:45,757 --> 01:12:48,317
I kept getting
these crazy phone calls.

1141
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:55,458
At that point, I'm just paranoid,
just bugging out.

1142
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:59,865
I couldn't sleep or rest. I was like,
"I'm just tired, and I wanna just..."

1143
01:13:01,306 --> 01:13:06,369
And I felt like I'm like a victim,
a target.

1144
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:10,442
I couldn't even sleep at home.
People could kill me at home.

1145
01:13:10,649 --> 01:13:13,482
And are the police gonna
come in and kill me?

1146
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:16,347
You know, is there secret police?

1147
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:20,282
I was so deep into the weed
at that point.

1148
01:13:21,126 --> 01:13:25,222
And I was like,
"I'm petrified. I'm vulnerable."

1149
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:30,065
I felt like just a prisoner
to my own fame.

1150
01:13:30,335 --> 01:13:32,735
That's why I wanted to die at that point.

1151
01:13:34,372 --> 01:13:38,433
I felt like, "If everybody's so worried,
why ain't nobody came to help?"

1152
01:13:41,346 --> 01:13:43,746
- Mr. Shakur?
- Open up, please. Open up.

1153
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:45,712
- Excuse me.
- Step back, please.

1154
01:13:45,917 --> 01:13:49,148
- Just keep it tight, that's all.
- How are you this morning?

1155
01:13:49,354 --> 01:13:54,690
The jury deliberated, then, after days
of twists worthy of a Hollywood drama,

1156
01:13:54,893 --> 01:13:57,726
Tupac Shakur has finally had
one question answered.

1157
01:13:57,929 --> 01:14:01,456
Tonight, the jury found him guilty
of three counts of sexual abuse,

1158
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:04,601
but innocent on six other charges,
including sodomy.

1159
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:09,632
Please, give me some space.
Please, man.

1160
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,968
Why did you decide to
leave the hospital?

1161
01:14:12,177 --> 01:14:16,011
Please, y'all are not letting me get
through, man. Let me get through!

1162
01:14:16,214 --> 01:14:18,079
- Back it up.
- Why did you leave?

1163
01:14:18,283 --> 01:14:21,275
And sentencing for this trial
has yet to be scheduled.

1164
01:14:34,332 --> 01:14:37,927
Where I was sent was
a maximum-security penitentiary.

1165
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:51,814
I know when I was young,
I couldn't wait to get to jail, straight up.

1166
01:14:52,017 --> 01:14:56,511
I mean, I was scared and everything,
but I felt that's part of being a man.

1167
01:15:00,926 --> 01:15:02,985
Now that I'm here,
this is not the spot.

1168
01:15:03,195 --> 01:15:08,030
I know everybody that comes out says,
"This ain't the spot." This isn't the spot.

1169
01:15:08,233 --> 01:15:12,363
Somebody tells you when to get up,
when you can shower, do this, do that.

1170
01:15:12,571 --> 01:15:16,337
They can speak to you any way they
want to, and you've gotta accept it.

1171
01:15:18,543 --> 01:15:22,104
You can die here, know what I mean?
Yesterday, a dude was murdered.

1172
01:15:22,314 --> 01:15:25,647
He wasn't in here on no murder beef.
He was in on a drug beef.

1173
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:29,514
He's gone. He's dead in jail,
you know what I mean?

1174
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:31,586
By another prisoner who had life.

1175
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:34,190
He had nothing to lose,
you know what I mean?

1176
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:39,222
I came to jail. I'm telling you, it's dirty.
It's filthy. It's like you're an animal.

1177
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,991
At first, me and the guards
had problems.

1178
01:15:44,202 --> 01:15:46,727
I got smacked and treated bad.

1179
01:15:46,938 --> 01:15:51,898
They did whatever they could to break
me because I used to talk a lot of shit.

1180
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:56,039
As soon as I got there, they went,
"There he goes, the rich nigger."

1181
01:15:56,248 --> 01:16:01,447
I was like, "Oh, shit, he said nigger!"
Everybody's looking at me like, "So?"

1182
01:16:01,653 --> 01:16:05,180
And I was like, "My God, this is where
I'm gonna be staying?"

1183
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:06,948
He just said "nigger"!

1184
01:16:07,158 --> 01:16:09,456
You've got "niggas"
in one of your records.

1185
01:16:09,661 --> 01:16:12,562
Niggas. He's talking about niggers.

1186
01:16:12,764 --> 01:16:16,359
Niggers was the ones on the rope,
hanging off the thing.

1187
01:16:16,568 --> 01:16:20,595
Niggas is the ones with gold ropes,
hanging out at clubs.

1188
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:30,272
I learned things there. In jail, it's like
how we should be in life, humble.

1189
01:16:30,482 --> 01:16:34,043
I was talking to skinheads
because if you don't like black people,

1190
01:16:34,252 --> 01:16:36,618
all right, that's fine.
That's your opinion.

1191
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:40,882
I want people to respect my opinion
when I'm rapping, so I'll respect yours.

1192
01:16:41,092 --> 01:16:44,960
You treat me with respect, I'll treat you
with respect, and we'll get along.

1193
01:16:45,163 --> 01:16:49,099
This skinhead, "hate black people" all
over, getting autographs for cousins.

1194
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:50,791
I accomplished something.

1195
01:16:51,002 --> 01:16:54,733
I know, by him getting my autograph,
that meant something to me.

1196
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:57,602
He couldn't hate black people
and get my autograph.

1197
01:17:00,378 --> 01:17:03,472
- The food was terrible, I guess.
- Oh, my goodness.

1198
01:17:03,682 --> 01:17:05,775
They've got this liver surprise thing.

1199
01:17:05,984 --> 01:17:09,215
The liver surprise. They're trying
to pump that jail on the menu.

1200
01:17:09,421 --> 01:17:13,050
They're trying to get it to go prime-time,
get it in the rotation.

1201
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:16,716
I was like, "We had this yesterday.
I liked it already, goddamn."

1202
01:17:16,928 --> 01:17:20,056
- No Tater Tots?
- No. Are you crazy? Tater Tots?

1203
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:24,531
I used to get baked potatoes
with a huge finger imprint on it.

1204
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:27,169
- All right.
- It was bad.

1205
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:31,172
No, you don't wanna get me started.
Jell-O with hair all in the mold.

1206
01:17:32,077 --> 01:17:35,308
I'd be like, "Damn, man,
how are you gonna mess up Jell-O?"

1207
01:17:35,513 --> 01:17:39,244
Jell-O is so wholesome and family-like.
It just ruins it for me.

1208
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:41,043
To have a hair in there, yeah.

1209
01:17:41,252 --> 01:17:45,348
I mean, I'm like, "Come on,
Bill Cosby pumps this, man!"

1210
01:17:46,391 --> 01:17:48,757
Put the hair in my Jell-O.

1211
01:17:49,995 --> 01:17:54,227
And you can't go, "There's a hair in
my Jell-O. I'd like to send this back.

1212
01:17:54,432 --> 01:17:56,059
"Can I see the cook, please?"

1213
01:17:56,267 --> 01:17:58,565
The cook is a big dude
named Bubba Joe.

1214
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:05,074
The first eight months I spent in
solitude 23 hours a day, reading.

1215
01:18:05,276 --> 01:18:07,244
I wrote a script called Live 2 Tell.

1216
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:11,176
I got How to Write a Screenplay,
that big famous book by Syd Field.

1217
01:18:11,383 --> 01:18:16,082
I got that, and I remembered all of the
scripts I ever read, and I wrote one.

1218
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:17,811
I read a lot of good books.

1219
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:22,790
I read a lot of Maya Angelou's books.
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.

1220
01:18:24,529 --> 01:18:27,862
But in terms of writing music
and lyrics, I couldn't do it.

1221
01:18:28,066 --> 01:18:31,866
Everybody's like, "He's in jail now.
He's gonna have the bomb album."

1222
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,537
But it's the opposite.

1223
01:18:33,738 --> 01:18:37,071
Prison kills your spirit, straight up.
It kills your spirit.

1224
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:42,335
I couldn't write. My inspiration was
gone because I was a caged animal.

1225
01:18:43,815 --> 01:18:47,080
But when I was in jail,
a lot of people supported me.

1226
01:18:47,285 --> 01:18:50,413
Jasmine Guy, Jada Pinkett,

1227
01:18:50,622 --> 01:18:53,250
Mickey Rourke,
he just wrote me funny stories.

1228
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:57,053
The name that sticks out the most,
I'll keep saying this, is Tony Danza.

1229
01:18:57,962 --> 01:19:00,522
To me, he is the bomb forever.

1230
01:19:00,732 --> 01:19:03,326
I will be his number one fan forever,

1231
01:19:03,535 --> 01:19:06,129
because when I got his letter,
I was like, "Whoa!"

1232
01:19:06,337 --> 01:19:09,272
I was screaming out to everybody,
"Guess who wrote me!"

1233
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:15,278
They had a story on the local news
that Madonna was coming to visit me.

1234
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,813
Madonna has so much power that
the guards gave me an extra shower

1235
01:19:19,017 --> 01:19:21,781
because they thought
she was coming to visit me.

1236
01:19:21,986 --> 01:19:25,717
I had guards walking me downstairs,
everything, trying to peep a look.

1237
01:19:25,924 --> 01:19:27,721
- Did she come?
- No. No, I'm glad.

1238
01:19:27,926 --> 01:19:30,895
- But you got the extra shower?
- Hey, I got the shower.

1239
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:37,766
The person that supported me
the most was my mother.

1240
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:42,265
When my mother got clean,
we got real close again.

1241
01:19:42,874 --> 01:19:48,369
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama

1242
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:53,711
I finally understand, for a woman
It ain't easy, trying to raise a man

1243
01:19:54,686 --> 01:19:57,450
I don't blame her for anything.

1244
01:19:57,856 --> 01:20:02,350
My mom's the bomb, you know.
The world's best mom.

1245
01:20:04,362 --> 01:20:07,126
- You are appreciated
- Lady

1246
01:20:07,665 --> 01:20:11,658
Don't you know we love you
Sweet lady

1247
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,270
"Dear Mama" is the song
I wrote for my mother.

1248
01:20:14,472 --> 01:20:16,269
But it's also for all the mothers.

1249
01:20:16,474 --> 01:20:18,942
I'm proud of that.
It affected a lot of people.

1250
01:20:19,711 --> 01:20:21,338
It was from Me Against the World,

1251
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:24,413
which was completed
before I went to jail.

1252
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:27,050
It's just me against the world

1253
01:20:30,088 --> 01:20:31,453
Me against the world, baby

1254
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:33,214
It was the number one record.

1255
01:20:33,424 --> 01:20:37,326
Me Against the World was
one of those... My career highs.

1256
01:20:39,063 --> 01:20:40,587
It was a trip in jail.

1257
01:20:40,798 --> 01:20:45,292
They'd say stuff like, "You're in jail.
Won't be any rapping for a long time."

1258
01:20:45,503 --> 01:20:48,404
I'd be like, "My album is
number one in the country.

1259
01:20:48,606 --> 01:20:50,335
"It just beat Bruce Springsteen."

1260
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:52,908
And they'd be like,
"Go back to your cell."

1261
01:20:54,145 --> 01:20:57,512
I used to get Entertainment Weekly
and see where my record was

1262
01:20:57,715 --> 01:21:01,242
and just trip out and be like,
"Number one in the whole country."

1263
01:21:01,452 --> 01:21:06,981
To me, it will always be my favorite,
and jail made me wanna dig deeper.

1264
01:21:19,137 --> 01:21:22,368
It took five bullets for me to see
what was really going on.

1265
01:21:22,574 --> 01:21:26,635
In jail, you get perspective, and you
start looking at things differently,

1266
01:21:26,844 --> 01:21:29,074
like everything is not so important.

1267
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,113
You know, you try not
to take it personal.

1268
01:21:32,317 --> 01:21:34,114
Because you're talking to killers.

1269
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:37,311
They say something you don't like,
you can't say, "What?"

1270
01:21:37,522 --> 01:21:42,050
You gotta be like, "OK, look man,
would you mind not calling me...?"

1271
01:21:42,260 --> 01:21:44,820
Anger management like
a mother.

1272
01:21:47,498 --> 01:21:50,763
In jail, I tried not to have
negative feelings towards nobody.

1273
01:21:50,969 --> 01:21:54,234
It's not like I wanted to get out
and go shoot somebody up.

1274
01:21:55,139 --> 01:21:58,768
People said, "You softened up."
Ain't nothing soft. Nothing changed.

1275
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:05,071
If anything, my mentality was like,
"Trust nobody.

1276
01:22:05,283 --> 01:22:08,650
"Trust nobody."

1277
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:15,057
It's not like I'm untouchable.
I could be killed as soon as I get out.

1278
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,326
I just thought,
"I already took five bullets,

1279
01:22:18,529 --> 01:22:21,191
"and if I can help it,
I don't plan on taking more."

1280
01:22:24,702 --> 01:22:28,399
Rapper, actor and convict, Tupac
Shakur, walked out of jail last week,

1281
01:22:28,606 --> 01:22:32,770
bailed out to the tune of $1.4 million by
Suge Knight of Death Row Records,

1282
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:34,569
which signed Shakur to a deal.

1283
01:22:34,779 --> 01:22:37,942
My closest friends did me in.
My closest friends, my homeys.

1284
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:41,277
I took care of their whole family,
took care of everything,

1285
01:22:41,486 --> 01:22:44,319
Iooked out for them, put them
in the game, turned on me.

1286
01:22:46,991 --> 01:22:50,893
So I just thought, "How could I make
them sorry they ever did this to me?

1287
01:22:51,095 --> 01:22:55,759
"How can I come back, like,
50 times stronger and better?"

1288
01:23:00,471 --> 01:23:04,202
Fear is stronger than love. Remember
that. Fear is stronger than love.

1289
01:23:04,409 --> 01:23:07,071
The love I gave meant nothing
when it came to fear.

1290
01:23:08,212 --> 01:23:10,840
No question, sign with Death Row.

1291
01:23:21,326 --> 01:23:23,624
Suddenly, I was out on bail,
pending appeal.

1292
01:23:24,028 --> 01:23:26,656
If I win my appeal, which,
if God wills, I will,

1293
01:23:26,864 --> 01:23:28,832
I would've done 11 months
for nothing.

1294
01:23:38,943 --> 01:23:42,674
You see that, judge? I didn't curse.
Probation people, I didn't curse.

1295
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,814
Give me my props. Let me stay free.

1296
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:47,041
I was relieved, happy to be home.

1297
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:53,348
I wanted to drive up
and down Sunset

1298
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:58,888
because I love L.A. with a passion.
I love Sunset, everything about L.A.

1299
01:23:59,097 --> 01:24:01,861
Can I get tatted up real quick?
I want a crown here.

1300
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,395
You know, the energy, that's L.A.

1301
01:24:04,602 --> 01:24:06,194
- Hello?
- I'm saying,

1302
01:24:06,404 --> 01:24:10,397
we on Venice Beach. It's what you do.
I've been in jail 11 months, Tabitha.

1303
01:24:10,608 --> 01:24:12,838
You're supposed to put "I love you".

1304
01:24:13,044 --> 01:24:15,308
You got to let me get a look
at something.

1305
01:24:15,513 --> 01:24:18,107
It's a trip when last week
you were in a cell,

1306
01:24:18,316 --> 01:24:21,752
and then, next week, I'm up at Monty's
with Cristal champagne

1307
01:24:21,953 --> 01:24:25,445
and filet mignon and lobster
and shrimps.

1308
01:24:26,557 --> 01:24:31,859
Everybody went, "Let me take you out.
You're home? Let me take you to this!"

1309
01:24:32,063 --> 01:24:35,999
We was all up in Roscoe's.
I even celebrated at El Pollo Loco

1310
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,397
because I was dreaming about
El Pollo Loco the whole time.

1311
01:24:41,606 --> 01:24:43,699
Then I went straight to the studio.

1312
01:24:45,543 --> 01:24:48,569
And I did 24 tracks in
less than two weeks.

1313
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,272
You can mix it later and have niggas
that love being in the studio

1314
01:24:52,483 --> 01:24:56,249
just add the drumbeat and shit. You
can do that after the rappers leave.

1315
01:24:56,754 --> 01:24:58,119
That's when it's fresh.

1316
01:24:58,322 --> 01:25:01,917
Get that beat popping, throw them
niggas on the track, put it down.

1317
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,890
Everybody will listen, be like,
"This is the hook."

1318
01:25:05,096 --> 01:25:07,121
We'll go lay the hook.
That's the song.

1319
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:10,926
Plus, I had so much to say,
I figured this was the best way to vent,

1320
01:25:11,135 --> 01:25:14,002
instead of paying some
psychotherapist $50 million.

1321
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:16,264
I went in the studio. It was cheaper.

1322
01:25:16,474 --> 01:25:20,103
Here we go! California, get up!

1323
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:26,115
Out on bail, fresh out of jail
California dreaming

1324
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:28,683
Soon as I step on the scene
I'm hearing hoochies screaming

1325
01:25:28,886 --> 01:25:32,287
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of the West Side player

1326
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:33,980
Where cowards die
And the strong ball

1327
01:25:34,192 --> 01:25:36,922
Only in Cali, where we riot, not rally
To live and die

1328
01:25:37,128 --> 01:25:39,426
In L.A., we wear Chucks, not Ballies

1329
01:25:39,630 --> 01:25:42,190
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits
And ride is what we do

1330
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,868
Flossin' but have caution
We collide with other crews

1331
01:25:45,069 --> 01:25:47,765
You gotta realize one thing:
Tupac is Death Row.

1332
01:25:48,873 --> 01:25:52,468
I feel I have more than just
a business relationship with him.

1333
01:25:52,677 --> 01:25:54,508
He can be like a brother, a friend.

1334
01:25:54,712 --> 01:25:58,671
I like everyone on the record company.
I like Suge, Snoop and Dre.

1335
01:25:58,883 --> 01:26:01,374
I hang out with them anyway,
now it's official.

1336
01:26:01,586 --> 01:26:04,885
This is Tupac and Dr. Dre,
and this is the Week in Rock!

1337
01:26:05,089 --> 01:26:08,024
- Week in Rock, baby!
- Week in Rock, baby!

1338
01:26:08,226 --> 01:26:11,718
I came out, I was like,
"Dre, I want some beats right now."

1339
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:14,691
He's like, "I'm working on
'California Love'."

1340
01:26:14,899 --> 01:26:16,696
I said, "You know you owe me this.

1341
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:19,495
"I'm new on Death Row,
fresh out of jail.

1342
01:26:19,704 --> 01:26:22,195
"You ain't gonna be finishing
your album soon."

1343
01:26:22,406 --> 01:26:26,206
I love collaborating with creative people
that's as talented as 'Pac.

1344
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:29,846
He got right in and wrote his lyrics
while he was behind the mike

1345
01:26:30,047 --> 01:26:31,639
and dropped it, and it's funky.

1346
01:26:31,849 --> 01:26:34,579
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre

1347
01:26:34,785 --> 01:26:36,844
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.

1348
01:26:37,255 --> 01:26:40,520
Me coming to Death Row,
for another reason was Snoop.

1349
01:26:40,725 --> 01:26:42,920
Please welcome
America's Most Wanted,

1350
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:45,857
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac.

1351
01:26:46,063 --> 01:26:47,963
The man got so much style.

1352
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:52,192
Ya'll know we down with this
rock thing, nine-six flavor, Death Row.

1353
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:55,031
But who knew it would last,
this West Side staff?

1354
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:59,938
Yep, yep, yep. This is me and Snoop,
"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted",

1355
01:27:00,144 --> 01:27:02,203
the bomb track. It's the first single.

1356
01:27:02,413 --> 01:27:05,075
It's gonna be like the anthem
of West Coast rap.

1357
01:27:05,283 --> 01:27:08,116
This is gonna shake the whole
music scene, guaranteed.

1358
01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:12,889
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party

1359
01:27:14,759 --> 01:27:18,092
Oh, shit
You done fucked up now

1360
01:27:18,296 --> 01:27:20,093
You done put two of
America's Most Wanted

1361
01:27:20,298 --> 01:27:23,392
In the same motherfucking place
At the same motherfucking time

1362
01:27:25,269 --> 01:27:28,727
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses

1363
01:27:28,973 --> 01:27:31,100
Picture perfect
I paint a perfect picture

1364
01:27:31,309 --> 01:27:33,641
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intention's to get richer

1365
01:27:33,844 --> 01:27:35,744
With the S-N-double-O-P Dogg
My fucking homey

1366
01:27:35,947 --> 01:27:37,642
You's a cold-ass nigga
On them hogs

1367
01:27:37,848 --> 01:27:40,612
I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run

1368
01:27:40,818 --> 01:27:43,548
Now I'm back in the courtroom
Waiting on the outcome

1369
01:27:43,754 --> 01:27:47,212
Me and Snoop represent the nucleus
of the entire ghetto.

1370
01:27:47,425 --> 01:27:50,588
Snoop represents the more calm,
all legit, by the book,

1371
01:27:50,795 --> 01:27:53,127
no waves,
let's get our business handled.

1372
01:27:53,331 --> 01:27:54,855
You're doing your job every day

1373
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:57,364
And then you work so hard
Till your hair turn gray

1374
01:27:57,568 --> 01:27:59,763
Let me tell you about life
And about the way it is

1375
01:27:59,971 --> 01:28:02,098
You see, we live by the gun
So we die by the gun's kids

1376
01:28:02,306 --> 01:28:04,900
Tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away

1377
01:28:05,109 --> 01:28:07,304
Floating in a black Benz
And trying to do a show a day

1378
01:28:07,511 --> 01:28:12,642
I represent the hard-core, no-holds-
barred, no-prisoners, relentless thug.

1379
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:17,219
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block

1380
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:19,184
Schemes for currency
And dough-related

1381
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:22,223
Affiliated with the hustlers
And so we made it

1382
01:28:22,426 --> 01:28:25,395
We both represent
both sides of the game.

1383
01:28:25,596 --> 01:28:29,191
The calm one and the relentless one.

1384
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,130
My nigga, Dogg, with me
Eternally the most wanted

1385
01:28:32,336 --> 01:28:34,270
Here's my commercial for Death Row.

1386
01:28:34,472 --> 01:28:37,669
If you come to Death Row,
you will see

1387
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:42,608
your art brought to a bigger plateau,
and you will be paid one of these days.

1388
01:28:42,813 --> 01:28:45,179
Death Row. Count with me.
Count with me.

1389
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:47,044
This is for my homeboys in jail.

1390
01:28:47,251 --> 01:28:50,049
These are 100s.
And they ain't counterfeit.

1391
01:28:50,354 --> 01:28:53,152
If I said it was the money,
the struggle continues.

1392
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:56,918
I got money, but I have to pay
everybody even more money.

1393
01:28:57,762 --> 01:28:59,821
I owe money to Death Row.

1394
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:04,764
So it's not just, "Oh, he's paid.
He's living large." It's not like that.

1395
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:11,404
People wanna sue you,
and I have to settle for this and that

1396
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:14,635
when I know I didn't do anything,
just because it's like:

1397
01:29:14,845 --> 01:29:19,009
"I don't wanna go to court another
eight months." Makes you work harder.

1398
01:29:24,855 --> 01:29:27,551
Next year, Death Row is gonna
print our own money.

1399
01:29:27,758 --> 01:29:30,420
We make so much,
we need to start printing our own.

1400
01:29:30,628 --> 01:29:33,461
It's gonna be me and Suge
on the $100 bill.

1401
01:29:33,664 --> 01:29:36,497
Me, Suge and Damu gonna be
on the $100 bill.

1402
01:29:36,701 --> 01:29:38,066
I felt I'm getting pimped.

1403
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:41,067
This is the $100 bill
on Death Row money, here.

1404
01:29:41,672 --> 01:29:45,438
But you have to come up, start from
the bottom and work up to the top.

1405
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:48,879
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome acclaimed rap artist

1406
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,241
and Grammy nominee, Tupac.

1407
01:29:56,987 --> 01:29:59,888
People fail to realize
this is not just play. I work.

1408
01:30:00,091 --> 01:30:02,184
Run! Scatter, scatter!

1409
01:30:02,693 --> 01:30:05,560
Drag K off the stage.
Y'all come on, man.

1410
01:30:05,763 --> 01:30:07,731
Do it for real, man. One, two, three.

1411
01:30:09,066 --> 01:30:12,229
When it's time to get down
and do my business, I'm going to.

1412
01:30:12,436 --> 01:30:14,631
I can't get no blood on the set?

1413
01:30:14,839 --> 01:30:17,273
Shit.

1414
01:30:20,778 --> 01:30:24,908
I believe I'm more responsible,
more mature and more focused.

1415
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:27,979
You don't say you need me

1416
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:33,517
You don't sing me love songs

1417
01:30:34,024 --> 01:30:42,124
Y'all don't bring us flowers anymore

1418
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:45,393
When I was in jail, I couldn't
remember why I was rapping.

1419
01:30:45,603 --> 01:30:50,233
But I was away from it so long, I said,
"I really like going to the studio.

1420
01:30:50,441 --> 01:30:51,738
"I really like creating."

1421
01:30:51,942 --> 01:30:54,342
Living held down
My game plan, to be trained

1422
01:30:54,545 --> 01:30:56,638
And military mind of a thug lord

1423
01:30:56,847 --> 01:30:59,577
I like music, and I like acting.
I like doing it.

1424
01:30:59,784 --> 01:31:04,778
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky

1425
01:31:08,025 --> 01:31:10,892
I can be me. I can be whoever
because I'm true to me.

1426
01:31:11,095 --> 01:31:13,120
The reason I sell six million records,

1427
01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:16,493
the reason I can go to jail
and come out without a scratch,

1428
01:31:17,668 --> 01:31:22,037
the reason I am who I am is because I
can look into my face and find my soul.

1429
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,002
It's there. I didn't sell it.

1430
01:31:24,208 --> 01:31:25,766
So lash out and get a glass

1431
01:31:25,976 --> 01:31:28,274
Done finally got his own drink
Call it the best

1432
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:31,471
Introducing a special brew
Made for a chosen few

1433
01:31:31,682 --> 01:31:33,547
I'm thugged out
While Snoop Dogg's sipping blue

1434
01:31:35,719 --> 01:31:38,688
I thought, "I'm a superpower.
Death Row is a superpower.

1435
01:31:38,889 --> 01:31:41,221
"Let's combine superpowers and ally."

1436
01:31:46,397 --> 01:31:50,356
Damu! My dog's going crazy,
ready to kill a few people.

1437
01:31:50,568 --> 01:31:52,399
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He wanna kill.

1438
01:31:53,037 --> 01:31:54,402
I love my artists.

1439
01:31:54,605 --> 01:31:57,870
I don't consider my people artists.
I consider them family.

1440
01:31:58,075 --> 01:32:02,011
It's just a big difference, if they
decided to turn in rapping or singing,

1441
01:32:02,213 --> 01:32:04,773
they'd still be my homeboys.
We'd still travel together.

1442
01:32:04,982 --> 01:32:08,110
If they needed something,
what's mine will still be theirs.

1443
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:11,811
It's no situation where I'm dealing
with them strictly for business,

1444
01:32:12,022 --> 01:32:14,149
because they're good.
It's not like that.

1445
01:32:14,358 --> 01:32:17,088
You've gotta have more respect
for your people.

1446
01:32:17,294 --> 01:32:19,421
Plus we've got a Death Row East
going on.

1447
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:22,463
- I'm sure you heard about that.
- Tell me about that.

1448
01:32:22,666 --> 01:32:26,124
Hold on. Damu! Damu, sit!

1449
01:32:38,315 --> 01:32:43,082
But Death Row has a reputation
for having a thug-like mentality.

1450
01:32:43,787 --> 01:32:45,379
Won't that get you in trouble?

1451
01:32:45,589 --> 01:32:49,548
Death Row has a bigger reputation
for success than anything else.

1452
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,093
The reason for all of the fear
involves the world of this man,

1453
01:32:53,297 --> 01:32:55,265
the man getting out of the limousine.

1454
01:32:55,466 --> 01:32:59,926
Six-foot-three, 335-pound
Marion Knight,

1455
01:33:00,137 --> 01:33:03,573
known by the nickname of "Suge",
short for "Sugar".

1456
01:33:03,774 --> 01:33:06,265
It's an efficient camp over here,

1457
01:33:07,144 --> 01:33:10,409
professional, business-oriented.
I like that.

1458
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:14,344
At the age of only 30,
and with a lengthy criminal record,

1459
01:33:14,551 --> 01:33:16,849
including three felony convictions,

1460
01:33:17,054 --> 01:33:19,386
Suge Knight has managed
to become the head

1461
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,888
of a $100 million record company

1462
01:33:22,092 --> 01:33:26,995
and one of the most powerful
and feared men in the music industry.

1463
01:33:27,197 --> 01:33:30,462
The controversy
over Death Row Records

1464
01:33:30,668 --> 01:33:34,798
and its owner
being sort of a gangster.

1465
01:33:35,005 --> 01:33:36,802
Everybody's asking about Death Row.

1466
01:33:37,007 --> 01:33:39,635
- Suge ain't no gangsta. He's chilling.
- No?

1467
01:33:39,843 --> 01:33:42,505
No, man, Suge a rider.

1468
01:33:42,713 --> 01:33:45,978
I know what good morals are,
but you're supposed to disregard

1469
01:33:46,183 --> 01:33:49,050
good morals when you're
living in a crazy, bad world.

1470
01:33:49,253 --> 01:33:51,312
If you're in hell,
how can you live like an angel?

1471
01:33:51,522 --> 01:33:54,013
You're surrounded by devils,
trying to be an angel?

1472
01:33:54,224 --> 01:33:57,057
That's like suicide.

1473
01:33:57,428 --> 01:34:00,420
I'd like to tell Tupac to keep
his guards up. We're with him.

1474
01:34:00,631 --> 01:34:02,258
One other thing I'd like to say,

1475
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:04,730
any artist out there
that want to be an artist

1476
01:34:04,935 --> 01:34:07,597
and wants to stay a star
and don't wanna have to worry

1477
01:34:07,805 --> 01:34:11,741
about the executive producer
trying to be all in the videos,

1478
01:34:11,942 --> 01:34:16,902
all on the records, dancing,
come to Death Row.

1479
01:34:17,982 --> 01:34:21,748
When I got out of jail, the West Coast-
East Coast shit was really starting.

1480
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:25,649
Wait, the East Coast don't love
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg?

1481
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:28,785
The East Coast
ain't got no love for Dr. Dre

1482
01:34:28,993 --> 01:34:31,018
and Snoop Dogg and Death Row?

1483
01:34:31,228 --> 01:34:35,289
West Coast was Death Row.
The East Coast was Bad Boy.

1484
01:34:35,499 --> 01:34:37,228
Check this out.

1485
01:34:37,434 --> 01:34:40,801
I'm the executive producer that
a comment was made about earlier.

1486
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:45,999
Everybody thought it was a war,
a war for record sales and attention.

1487
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:50,806
But to me it was personal.

1488
01:34:51,749 --> 01:34:54,047
I love the East Coast.
I'm from the East Coast.

1489
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:58,449
But I felt like Puffy and Biggie wanted
to dirty up everything I worked for.

1490
01:34:58,655 --> 01:35:00,919
So it made me come back
more relentless.

1491
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:03,650
I'm mad at Biggie. I'm rushing
the nigga. What's the problem?

1492
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:06,352
Yo, Piggie, man,
we got it going on, baby.

1493
01:35:06,563 --> 01:35:10,693
It's on and cracking, man.
He's gone, baby. You the man.

1494
01:35:10,901 --> 01:35:12,493
So I directed videos.

1495
01:35:12,703 --> 01:35:17,072
'Pac, you alive? I mean, you safe?
Man, I'm so happy you're free.

1496
01:35:18,108 --> 01:35:22,044
Yeah? Happy to see you,
lying piece of shit.

1497
01:35:22,246 --> 01:35:25,079
'Pac, please don't kill me.
It was Buff's idea.

1498
01:35:25,282 --> 01:35:26,772
- No, man.
- I'm just a rapper.

1499
01:35:26,984 --> 01:35:29,714
Please don't take me out of the game.

1500
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,185
I ain't going to kill you.
We was homeboys once, Pig.

1501
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:35,984
Once we homeboys,
we always homeboys,

1502
01:35:36,193 --> 01:35:37,785
even if you is a fat phony.

1503
01:35:37,995 --> 01:35:41,089
And I did a song
with Faith, Biggie's wife.

1504
01:35:41,298 --> 01:35:45,735
Faith's my homegirl. I just want
to send a shout-out to Faith. Hey, girl.

1505
01:35:46,036 --> 01:35:47,697
Then I did "Hit 'Em Up".

1506
01:35:47,905 --> 01:35:51,568
That's why I fucked your bitch,
You fat motherfucker

1507
01:35:51,775 --> 01:35:53,868
Which is a classic battle record.

1508
01:35:54,078 --> 01:35:56,410
First off, fuck your bitch
And the clique you claim

1509
01:35:56,613 --> 01:35:58,911
West Side, when we ride
Come equipped with game

1510
01:35:59,116 --> 01:36:01,550
You claim to be a player
But I fucked your wife

1511
01:36:01,752 --> 01:36:03,811
We bust on Bad Boys
Niggas fucked for life

1512
01:36:04,021 --> 01:36:05,921
I'm a self-made millionaire

1513
01:36:06,123 --> 01:36:08,819
Thug living out of prison
Pistols in the air

1514
01:36:09,026 --> 01:36:11,324
Biggie, remember when I used
To let you sleep on the couch

1515
01:36:11,528 --> 01:36:13,962
And beg a bitch
To let you sleep in the house

1516
01:36:14,164 --> 01:36:16,428
- Now it's all about Versace
- You copied my style

1517
01:36:16,633 --> 01:36:18,999
- Five shots couldn't drop me
- I took it and smiled

1518
01:36:19,203 --> 01:36:20,602
Now I'm about set the record straight

1519
01:36:20,804 --> 01:36:23,398
With my AK, I'm still the thug
That you love to hate

1520
01:36:24,875 --> 01:36:27,105
Grab your Glocks
When you see Tupac

1521
01:36:27,311 --> 01:36:29,711
Call the cops when you see Tupac

1522
01:36:29,913 --> 01:36:31,744
Who shot me?
But you punks didn't finish that

1523
01:36:31,949 --> 01:36:33,780
You're about to feel
The wrath of a menace

1524
01:36:34,952 --> 01:36:38,319
Everything happened
so fast at that point.

1525
01:36:38,789 --> 01:36:41,622
I was looking at things,
the East Coast-West Coast thing,

1526
01:36:41,825 --> 01:36:43,258
it just got out of control.

1527
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:46,224
Dudes was getting killed,
and I felt responsible.

1528
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:48,125
But I couldn't stop it.

1529
01:36:48,332 --> 01:36:51,301
We ain't mad at the whole New York,
just certain people.

1530
01:36:51,502 --> 01:36:55,165
I got this project coming out along with
some brothers called One Nation.

1531
01:36:55,372 --> 01:36:57,863
It's like an East Coast-West Coast
collaboration

1532
01:36:58,075 --> 01:37:00,066
to kill this whole new vibe.

1533
01:37:00,277 --> 01:37:01,904
Everybody want it to be a war

1534
01:37:02,112 --> 01:37:04,046
between the East Coast
and West Coast.

1535
01:37:04,248 --> 01:37:06,148
It's really a problem
with two rappers.

1536
01:37:06,350 --> 01:37:08,978
The East Coast-West Coast thing
is something journalists

1537
01:37:09,186 --> 01:37:11,313
are making up to get paid off,
so it can drag out

1538
01:37:11,522 --> 01:37:15,185
and everybody can have albums. They
perpetuate this, so it can be drama.

1539
01:37:15,392 --> 01:37:17,553
When it go down,
don't look at me and Biggie

1540
01:37:17,761 --> 01:37:19,922
and be like, "Why is there a big
East Coast/West Coast war?"

1541
01:37:20,130 --> 01:37:23,827
When you're shooting this
to 3,300 homes, 300 countries,

1542
01:37:24,034 --> 01:37:26,969
telling them about a war
that they would never know exists.

1543
01:37:27,171 --> 01:37:29,537
That's where information
becomes a problem.

1544
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:32,538
We both need
to exercise greater restraint.

1545
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:38,347
Damn, sometimes life gets
messed up.

1546
01:37:44,188 --> 01:37:48,818
When I was on Death Row,
I was successful but not happy.

1547
01:37:49,026 --> 01:37:52,655
Tupac, your life has been marred
by considerable pain.

1548
01:37:52,996 --> 01:37:56,898
Do you think you'll get to the point
where you can live a normal life?

1549
01:37:57,100 --> 01:38:00,900
No. But, I...

1550
01:38:01,104 --> 01:38:04,335
I'm going for it. I'm trying for it,
and until then

1551
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:07,806
I have to make the life that I do live
as happy as I can

1552
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:10,946
and try to do the best
with what I have.

1553
01:38:11,148 --> 01:38:14,345
Live the best life I can live,
be as happy as I can be.

1554
01:38:14,551 --> 01:38:18,578
Nothing is perfect for anybody,
I don't think.

1555
01:38:18,789 --> 01:38:21,383
I felt trapped.

1556
01:38:21,925 --> 01:38:23,916
They say, "You made your bed,
lay in it"?

1557
01:38:24,127 --> 01:38:26,595
I tried to move.
I can't move to no other bed.

1558
01:38:26,797 --> 01:38:29,493
I felt I can't live a different lifestyle.

1559
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:32,225
This the life they gave me,
this the life I made.

1560
01:38:32,436 --> 01:38:35,837
I felt I can't change, not for the courts,
not for the parole board,

1561
01:38:36,039 --> 01:38:38,200
not for nobody. This is it.

1562
01:38:38,408 --> 01:38:42,572
I also felt like something was gonna
happen to me because I'm paranoid.

1563
01:38:42,779 --> 01:38:44,804
And I put it in my videos.

1564
01:38:50,721 --> 01:38:53,690
That nigga ain't want none.
I been drinking. Where he at?

1565
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,790
No, no, no, where he at?

1566
01:38:57,828 --> 01:38:59,261
Yo, watch out.

1567
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:06,266
It was a prophecy.

1568
01:39:14,711 --> 01:39:17,441
I had a prophecy about my death.

1569
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:22,483
That's why I go in the studio and do
three songs a day, get things ready.

1570
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,783
We don't have time or the luxury

1571
01:39:24,988 --> 01:39:28,287
to spend all of this time
doing one song. We don't have it.

1572
01:39:28,492 --> 01:39:30,084
If I die, it can happen.

1573
01:39:30,294 --> 01:39:34,128
If anything were to happen to me,
that album's ready to go.

1574
01:39:34,531 --> 01:39:36,192
So it's all good.

1575
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,062
I felt as if the only thing
that can kill me is death,

1576
01:39:39,269 --> 01:39:42,170
and even then my music
will live forever.

1577
01:40:39,529 --> 01:40:42,965
At approximately 9:00 p.m.,
security cameras at the MGM Grand

1578
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:46,761
captured Tupac, Suge Knight and
members of the Death Row entourage

1579
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:50,064
beating an alleged South Side Crip,
Orlando Anderson.

1580
01:40:50,273 --> 01:40:53,731
Tupac, Suge and others jumped
Anderson, punching and kicking him.

1581
01:40:53,944 --> 01:40:57,345
Terrified bystanders scattered
as the group streamed into the casino

1582
01:40:57,547 --> 01:40:58,775
then out into the street.

1583
01:41:31,615 --> 01:41:33,640
Whoa.

1584
01:41:37,387 --> 01:41:39,287
Just after the Mike Tyson fight,

1585
01:41:39,489 --> 01:41:42,390
Shakur, with record company
executive, Suge Knight,

1586
01:41:42,592 --> 01:41:45,254
headed for a club.
While stopping at this intersection

1587
01:41:45,462 --> 01:41:48,829
a car with four people pulled up
and fired on Shakur and Knight.

1588
01:41:49,032 --> 01:41:51,296
Shakur was shot
several times in the chest.

1589
01:41:51,501 --> 01:41:54,629
The driver, his record producer,
was grazed in the head.

1590
01:41:54,838 --> 01:41:57,500
He's returned to intensive care
after another surgery,

1591
01:41:57,707 --> 01:41:59,106
still in critical condition.

1592
01:41:59,309 --> 01:42:02,437
All week long fans of Tupac
have gathered outside the hospital.

1593
01:42:02,646 --> 01:42:04,238
He's undergone two operations.

1594
01:42:04,448 --> 01:42:07,349
His right lung was removed.
He's intermittently conscious.

1595
01:42:07,551 --> 01:42:10,042
Jesse Jackson's been here.
Family is keeping vigil.

1596
01:42:10,253 --> 01:42:12,847
Despite reports that his wounds
were not life-threatening,

1597
01:42:13,056 --> 01:42:18,119
people at the hospital continue to tell
us he is in very serious condition.

1598
01:42:19,296 --> 01:42:24,791
At 4:03 this afternoon,
Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead.

1599
01:42:31,975 --> 01:42:34,967
Who shot me?
Shit, I don't know.

1600
01:42:35,178 --> 01:42:36,907
Sorry.

1601
01:42:40,016 --> 01:42:43,008
My death, it's a tragedy
like Shakespeare, I guess.

1602
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:46,314
But I have no bad feelings.
I have love for everybody.

1603
01:42:46,523 --> 01:42:49,686
Please welcome the mothers
of Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur,

1604
01:42:49,893 --> 01:42:53,226
Afeni Shakur and Voletta Wallace.

1605
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:16,180
Coming to grips
with my past, it was hard.

1606
01:43:16,386 --> 01:43:19,685
I don't feel what I did was evil.
I feel like the way I was living

1607
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:24,327
and my mentality was a part
of my progression to be a man.

1608
01:43:28,532 --> 01:43:30,762
But we grow. We all grow.
We're made to grow.

1609
01:43:30,967 --> 01:43:34,164
You either evolve,
or you disappear.

1610
01:43:35,038 --> 01:43:36,835
I don't want to be forgotten.

1611
01:43:37,541 --> 01:43:40,738
I'll always be a troublemaker
to some people.

1612
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:44,179
But I still get love
from my community.

1613
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:57,692
I owe them everything. That's why
I owe everything to the 'hood.

1614
01:43:58,395 --> 01:43:59,794
I've got love there.

1615
01:44:00,697 --> 01:44:03,188
I've got love from thugs
and the street dudes.

1616
01:44:04,935 --> 01:44:07,768
And that focuses me back
on what I should be doing,

1617
01:44:07,971 --> 01:44:10,633
lay out the real mat
on the world and how it is.

1618
01:44:15,545 --> 01:44:17,706
The message is,
young black males could do anything

1619
01:44:17,914 --> 01:44:20,883
if you just give us a shot,
stop trying to beat us down.

1620
01:44:21,284 --> 01:44:26,051
And to my homeboys, we need
to be in control of ourselves.

1621
01:44:28,525 --> 01:44:31,688
I'm not saying I'll change the world,
but I guarantee I'll spark

1622
01:44:31,895 --> 01:44:34,796
the brain that will change the world.

1623
01:44:38,768 --> 01:44:41,760
So keep your head up.

1624
01:44:41,972 --> 01:44:44,099
Do what you've gotta do.

1625
01:44:46,076 --> 01:44:50,638
And then inside of you,
I'll be reborn.

1626
01:44:51,305 --> 01:45:51,647
