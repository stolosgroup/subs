at the Amityville house.

And now we're gonna talk to my next guest,

227

Dr. Steven Kaplan, who says that the
investigations the Warrens conducted

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,402
into the Amityville haunting
is a load of hogwash.

Why is that?

230
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,046
Well, it's been well established
that Amityville was a blatant hoax.

- But that hasn't stopped...
- That's never been proven.

Yes, it has.

The Lutz family made everything up so
they could profit off of all the publicity.

You know, when I was about your age,

821

and I saw an angel.

Yeah.

823
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:11,206
It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.

824
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,365
It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.

825

And it looked right at me.

Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,

but I knew it was real.

Look, I know how it is.

No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.

And what about Peggy?

1106

She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse

to get better housing from the council.
