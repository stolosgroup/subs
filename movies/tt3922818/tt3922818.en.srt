00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,679
"I want to go to Mars.

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,796
"Not just to visit.
I want to live there.

4
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,632
"Because then
I'd be living proof

5
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,951
"that life on
Mars was possible.

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,113
"Proof that
if we had to,

7
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,956
"mankind could make
a fresh start.

8
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,872
"We're in trouble,
and it's our fault.

9
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,034
"And we're running out of time and
Mother Nature doesn't negotiate.

10
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,391
"We can't give up. Not now.

11
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,714
"Mars is a planet ripe
and ready for life.

12
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,675
"Earth's resources
may be depleted,

13
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,311
"but there's one resource
we must never neglect.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,991
"It's the most valuable

15
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,192
"and it's the one
without limits.

16
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,954
"Courage."

17
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,272
I wrote those words...

18
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,994
I wrote those words
when I was 12 years old.

19
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,277
My letter to the White House.

20
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,998
Never did I imagine
the president

21
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,838
would read them aloud
to a nation

22
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,190
mourning the loss of yet
another crew of astronauts.

23
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,670
Never did I dream

24
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,436
that I would be proclaimed
an "Emblem of Fortitude,"

25
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,069
a "Young Man with
a Singular Vision."

26
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,078
And the rest is, well...

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,268
It's not history.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,958
Just the beginning.

29
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,710
So, here we all are.

30
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,031
Thanks to Genesis
Space Technologies,

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,240
in 20 hours the Magellan-61 will
travel six astronauts to Mars,

32
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,958
not to visit,
but to live there.

33
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,316
The first true
citizens of Mars!

34
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,275
From a childhood vision
to the greatest space endeavor

35
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,714
the world has ever attempted,

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,629
the settlement known
as East Texas, Mars.

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,159
Come on, say it with me.

38
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,630
Just add water!

39
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Yes!

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,990
Well, whatever I am,

41
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,677
I cannot begin to compare
to these six heroes,

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,910
living examples of
courage without limits.

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,989
And on that note,

44
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,193
I would like to
hand things off

45
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,269
to the mission head
of this historic expedition,

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,434
Lead Astronaut Sarah Elliot.

47
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,111
Sorry if we only have time
for a couple of questions.

48
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,200
You know what it's like
the night before a trip.

49
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,636
Scott Hubbard,
Aerospace Times.

50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Miss Elliot,

51
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,630
how does it feel to sacrifice the
next four years of your life to Mars?

52
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,830
It's not a sacrifice.
It's an opportunity.

53
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,314
I feel humbled, excited, and grateful
for the chance to be a pioneer.

54
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,475
Miss Elliot,
aren't you scared,

55
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,915
given the history,
given the dangers?

56
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Of course.

57
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,718
I'm scared that I might let
the mission down in some way.

58
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,312
I was taught that people who took
risks without fear were brave.

59
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,670
Well, far braver are those that
take risks despite their fear.

60
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,433
Courage is fear that
has said its prayers.

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,560
T minus ten.

62
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,391
Nine. Eight.

63
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,914
Seven. Six.

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,914
Five. Four.

65
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,671
Three. Two.

66
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,995
One. Zero.

67
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Ignition.

68
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,318
Liftoff.

69
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,633
Liftoff for Magellan-61.

70
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,632
Stand by for docking
to Mars transfer vehicle.

71
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,559
Magellan speed is good.

72
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,792
Watch your drift, Sarah.

73
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,308
Contact.

74
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,994
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet.

75
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,880
Manual capture is confirmed.

76
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,152
Let's go to Mars!
Let's go to Mars!

77
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
You okay?

78
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,109
Yeah, I'm fine.

79
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,029
Sarah, can I have a word?

80
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,754
What's up?

81
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,993
Show it to me.

82
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,468
We can't just turn the
mission around, correct?

83
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,753
Doctor,
how's she doing, anyway?

84
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,256
You mean, aside
from being mortified?

85
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
She's fine.

86
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,072
Oh, this is a disaster.

87
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,516
Nathaniel, she's due
shortly after they arrive.

88
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,597
We need to get out
in front of this.

89
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,239
An astronaut
behaved irresponsibly

90
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,040
and NASA will make a decision what
to do as soon as the baby's born.

91
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,799
Decision about what?

92
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,071
About when to bring them back.

93
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,992
Tom, there's
a bigger issue here.

94
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,796
Subjecting a fetus to zero gravity
during its entire gestation...

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,355
It's uncharted territory.

96
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,189
We do not go to press.

97
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,952
We keep
this internal for now.

98
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,190
We need to gather
more information.

99
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
What are you saying?

100
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,856
I'm saying,
we go short-term contingency.

101
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,871
We have Dr. Loh deliver
the baby on Mars.

102
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,555
We keep this quiet.
We wait this out.

103
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,314
Sarah may have
behaved irresponsibly,

104
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,038
but she's no longer
just an astronaut

105
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,351
and it's not just
a Genesis decision.

106
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,839
She's a mother now.

107
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,718
It's her decision, too.

108
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,429
Big, deep breath.
Push, push, push!

109
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,431
Good. All right, big, deep breath.
Here we go.

110
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,557
And, push, push! Good.

111
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,553
Okay, good. Good job, Sarah.

112
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,789
Keep breathing.

113
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,256
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

114
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,474
One final push!

115
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,976
Come on,
come on, big, deep breath.

116
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,719
Is he okay?

117
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Well done.

118
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,308
He looks great.

119
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,159
Sarah. Sarah?

120
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,496
Sarah?
Her heart rate is dropping.

121
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Hey, something's wrong!

122
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,976
It's postpartum
preeclampsia.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,816
Push two milligrams of lorazepam, stat.

124
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,592
Take it easy. Take him.

125
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,079
You got him? You got him?

126
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,748
Sarah, breathe.

127
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,514
She's still not responding.
Give her 20 milligrams of...

128
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,309
Hurry, she's coding.

129
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,429
Come on, Sarah, breathe.

130
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,869
How long?

131
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,473
30 minutes
without a heartbeat.

132
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,473
Stop. Stop.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

133
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,630
She's gone. She's gone.

134
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,709
She's gone.

135
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,074
Mr. Shepherd, are you there?

136
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,478
We lost her.

137
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,797
Okay. Here's what we know.

138
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,430
Two-thirds less gravity will alter
the child's internal organs.

139
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,639
The heart will simply not be conditioned
to have the strength to pump

140
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,352
in the Earth's gravity.

141
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,477
Bones will be brittle,
probably oversized.

142
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,216
The child would never survive
the trip back to Earth.

143
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,959
Yeah, but, Nathaniel,
in the eyes of the world,

144
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,600
isn't this whole mission,
East Texas, an experiment?

145
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,069
And wouldn't we be forgiven?
Experiment?

146
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,711
Tom, this isn't a mouse.
This is not a monkey.

147
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,949
This is a human being.

148
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,256
And in the eyes of the world,

149
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,080
the lead astronaut of
the Genesis Mars Mission

150
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,550
not only got pregnant,
but died in childbirth,

151
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,996
sentencing a baby to a motherless
existence in outer space.

152
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,914
Imagine the bloody outcry.

153
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,676
East Texas runs on money,
science, good faith,

154
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,308
and above all, good PR.

155
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,993
We're not only talking
about a secret,

156
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,479
we're talking
about a cover-up.

157
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,390
It will bring
the company down.

158
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Unless.

159
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,117
Unless what?

160
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,078
Unless we don't cover up,
we take full responsibility.

161
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,639
We face it head-on.

162
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,159
Tom,

163
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,432
I wanna be on
the next mission.

164
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,839
As a passenger?
Yes.

165
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,115
Nathaniel, for the love of...
Oh, here we go.

166
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,349
No, actually, he's right.

167
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,816
There would be
no better show of support.

168
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,955
Thank you, Alice. Exactly.

169
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,416
You can imagine
their morale right now.

170
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,640
They've just
lost their leader.

171
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,591
Nathaniel,
it is out of the question.

172
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,159
And you know it.

173
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,031
Am I missing something here?

174
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,031
Doctor, will you
enlighten Alice, please?

175
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,509
Hydrocephalus.

176
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
We found it on Mr. Shepherd's
very first medical.

177
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,550
A congenital brain disorder.
It's basically benign.

178
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,553
Benign unless he wants to go into
outer space, and then nobody knows...

179
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,392
And what if I'm willing
to take that risk?

180
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,550
Sorry. Not happening.

181
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,391
So the child remains on Mars?

182
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I don't...

183
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,879
We don't have a choice.

184
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,678
Say we come clean
and we lose our financing.

185
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,469
Say we give up
everything we fought for.

186
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,830
Say we bring everyone home.
You heard the doctor.

187
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,309
The child wouldn't
even make the trip.

188
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,877
Keeping this a secret
saves the company,

189
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,992
which saves East Texas,
which saves the child.

190
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,714
So the child
remains classified?

191
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Yes.

192
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,268
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,954
Yes.

194
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,509
Can I bring your car around,
Mr. Shepherd?

195
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,154
Entering stratospheric flight.

196
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,675
Entering stratospheric flight.

197
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,069
Entering exospheric flight.

198
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,991
Entering exospheric flight.

199
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,670
Altitude limit.
Altitude limit.

200
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,831
- Approaching outer space.
- Yes!

201
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,990
Decrease velocity.
Danger. Over speed.

202
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,835
Decrease velocity.
Danger. Danger.

203
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,632
All perish.

204
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,840
Ha! There you are.

205
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,511
Centaur,
can you make me a map?

206
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,513
And what is it you'd like
a map of, Gardner Elliot?

207
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,240
A pathway through
the ventilation system

208
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,909
from my quarters to the storage
facility on East Texas.

209
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,071
And why would you
like that information?

210
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,079
That's none of your business.

211
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,875
It is my business.
I'm your best friend.

212
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,999
No. You're a machine with rudimentary
artificial intelligence.

213
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,118
A machine which
I helped to build.

214
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,395
That hurts my feelings.

215
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,919
You don't have feelings.

216
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,758
I do have feelings.
I'm your best friend.

217
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,758
I'm your teacher.
I'm your homie. Hug it out.

218
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,431
Get me a map of
the ventilation system.

219
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,238
Information classified.

220
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,120
No. I'm sorry.

222
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,032
Information classified.

223
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,599
Gardner, don't.

224
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,955
I'm your friend.
Gardner, stop.

225
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,953
Once upon a time,
deep in the 15-acre wood,

226
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,953
Frogsy found Owl
sitting on his doorstep.

227
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,634
The flood had
taken away his entire...

228
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,190
Centaur,
look who just bypassed

229
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,160
the East Texas infrastructure
firewall program.

230
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mission number.

231
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,594
We're running
out of time and...

232
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,319
"Mother Nature
doesn't negotiate."

233
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,475
...doesn't negotiate.

234
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,313
Letter to the White House,
and he's 12 years old. Blah, blah...

235
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,912
Sorry if we only have time...
Hey, Mom.

236
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,353
...for a couple
of questions.

237
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,400
You know what it's like
the night before a trip.

238
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,513
To be continued.

239
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,599
Colony 52 Bravo,

240
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,033
report to
the automatic air lock.

241
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,189
Colony 52 Bravo, report to
the automatic air lock.

242
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
You're late.

243
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,717
Hey, Kendra.

244
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,552
Hey.
What's up?

245
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,199
Have you seen this?
I mean...

246
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,677
Just, uh,
so cool. I mean...

247
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,040
Works better if
you turn it on.

248
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Right.

249
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,955
The irrigator
on 23 is blocked.

250
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,836
By the way,
I can't reach Centaur.

251
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,880
What have you done
with him this time?

252
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,280
Are you checking up on me?

253
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,536
Here you go, Kendra.
Thanks, Tony.

254
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,073
No. I'm checking up
on Centaur.

255
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,719
Yeah, who checks up on me.

256
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,553
You don't fool me,
Gardner Elliot.

257
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,715
You never have.

258
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,038
Okay. Uh, 23 should be clear.

259
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
Really?

260
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,229
Thanks a lot.

261
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,551
Here.
Thanks.

262
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,233
Okay, get on 17 now.

263
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,751
We'll make you
indispensable yet.

264
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
What?

265
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,719
How can I be indispensable
if no one knows I exist?

266
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,955
Okay.

267
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Open.

268
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
Play.

269
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,158
Virtual visit.

270
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,756
Hey! Come on!

271
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,156
Come on. Come on. Come on.

272
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,351
Want it? Come get it,
get it! Go fetch!

273
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,197
You go fetch it!
Hey!

274
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,078
What would you do
without me?

275
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,399
I'm gonna miss you.

276
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,639
I'm gonna miss you, too.

277
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,912
Come on.

278
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,628
Replay.

279
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Memo.

280
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,029
Print.

281
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,438
Centaur, some privacy.

282
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,910
Again? All you ever ask for
is privacy these days.

283
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,599
I remember a time
when you and I...

284
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,069
Where's the code?

285
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,395
Hey, Tulsa.

286
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,830
Say it with me.

287
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,110
Why?
Because misery loves company.

288
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,633
Why are you miserable?

289
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,952
Just dealing with the basic
people of the school.

290
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,078
You know, everybody's
always frontin'.

291
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,474
Nobody's ever real,
you know?

292
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,553
Tell me about it.

293
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,079
Anyway, the second I turn 18,
I am so outta here.

294
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,309
Emancipation...

295
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,311
"Emancipation,
mobility, music."

296
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,320
Are you making
fun of me, Gardner?

297
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,836
No, Tulsa. I just wish
I could go with you.

298
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,153
You've been saying that since last summer.
And you can.

299
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,995
No, I can't.

300
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,151
Oh, right. You can't
leave your house.

301
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,594
It's not a house, it's a
penthouse on Park Avenue.

302
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,673
I can't leave
because of my disease.

303
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,356
Osteogenesis Imperfecta.

304
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,670
Yeah.
Still don't believe you.

305
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,496
Wouldn't your
foster dad be unhappy?

306
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,512
Yeah. No more checks
from the state.

307
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,911
Study lab is over.
Gotta go.

308
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,592
See ya in
the funny papers.

309
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,510
What does that mean?
Hmm?

310
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,315
You always say that.
What does it mean?

311
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,598
I don't know,
I had a foster sister

312
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,400
in Oklahoma who used
to say it all the time.

313
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,712
Just a different way
of saying goodbye.

314
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,195
I like it.
Talk tomorrow?

315
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,717
I'm not going anywhere.

316
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,993
Where'd you get
this movie?

317
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,996
One of the German scientists who was
here last month left it behind.

318
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,197
How do you know
what's going on?

319
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,234
Excuse me?

320
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
It's easy.

321
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,388
You see those men there?
They're angels.

322
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,398
They look over the people on Earth
and make sure they're okay.

323
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,159
You see that angel?
Mmm-hmm.

324
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,234
He's gonna fall in love
with her and fall to Earth.

325
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,352
You're a romantic.

326
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,355
Then he won't be
an angel anymore.

327
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,432
He'll be just like her.

328
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,631
Hey, Tulsa,
give us a ride, you slut!

329
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,836
I got a Harley
you can ride.

330
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,479
Tulsa! Come here!

331
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,639
Come back here, you slut!

332
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Hey, boy!

333
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,832
What up, Chuck?

334
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,032
Don't get up 'cause of me.

335
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,713
"Hey, honey, how was your day?
Make any new friends yet?"

336
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,270
Oh, you bet. Boy, am I
fighting them off.

337
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,478
I'm the most popular girl
in my class.

338
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,598
Hey, did you get Thursday's check yet?
'Cause I wouldn't want you...

339
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,776
Wait a second,
it's Thursday!

340
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,870
Hey, hey, Chuck!
Chuck, wake up!

341
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,313
You gotta do
the Sanders farm.

342
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Hey, come on,
come on, wake up.

343
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,515
Listen to me. You have
one single property.

344
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,399
It's pretty simple, all right?
15 minutes, tops.

345
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,519
Okay, the starter.

346
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,268
Let's try the brakes.
It doesn't have brakes.

347
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,036
All right.
Now check the sprays.

348
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,869
Check.

349
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,235
Not while I'm standing
behind the plane!

350
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,795
Okay, we are gonna
lose another property.

351
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
You do it.

352
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
What?

353
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,430
You can fly this thing.
You do it.

354
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,789
Awesome parenting.
Seriously.

355
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,997
Risk my life for 190 bucks.

356
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,154
Good to know what
my life's worth to ya!

357
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,991
It's okay. I got ya.

358
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,919
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay. I'm right here.

359
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,914
Are you insane?

360
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,355
Do you think the exit protocol
doesn't apply to you?

361
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,917
You could've caused
an atmospheric breach,

362
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,672
not to mention, died.

363
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,228
Nobody rides unaccompanied,
no matter who they are!

364
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,437
Gardner, what's going on here?
This isn't like you.

365
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,034
You wouldn't understand.
My mother's out there.

366
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,872
How did you get past
the electronic lock?

367
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,591
Okay, that magnetic implant is there
to monitor the growth of your organs,

368
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,352
not serve as a passkey.

369
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,160
And how did you even
learn how to do that?

370
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,512
Raised by scientists,
in a bubble.

371
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Open.

372
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,911
That plaque for
your mother,

373
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,040
it's just a piece of
metal in the ground, okay?

374
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,713
Her ashes were spread
across the Pacific Ocean.

375
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,472
You deserve to know that.

376
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,394
She's not out there,
Gardner.

377
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,759
She's in you.

378
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,908
I don't like to go to
sleep with us in a fight.

379
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,273
We're not in a fight.

380
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
Okay.

381
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,190
This is how you greet
an old friend?

382
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,676
If he's unannounced, yes.

383
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,316
It's about the boy.

384
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,952
Mr. Shepherd, you have
no idea how smart he is.

385
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,190
He's being denied connection.

386
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,869
Not to do this,
at this point...

387
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,473
I'm sorry,
but it would be inhumane.

388
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,029
Miss Wyndham, I'm touched by
your concern, I really am.

389
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,959
But none of this matters
if he can't survive.

390
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,878
We've been through this.

391
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,152
For starters, we would have
to add carbon nanotubes

392
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,440
to strengthen
his bone density.

393
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,476
It's a very
complex procedure.

394
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,400
It's too risky. I'm sorry.

395
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,988
Tom, I can't sign on to this.

396
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,675
With all due respect, Nathaniel,
I'm not asking. I'm telling.

397
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,593
You've been gone
for 16 years.

398
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,816
You've dropped off
the face of the Earth.

399
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,114
Have you run this by NASA?

400
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,078
NASA has always felt
conflicted over this.

401
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,073
They wanna do the right
thing, which this is.

402
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,038
They wanna bring
the boy home.

403
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,912
Look, this is our chance
to turn bad PR into good PR.

404
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,736
Wait a minute, this has
nothing to do with PR.

405
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,988
I'm talking about
a boy's life.

406
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Hang on, hang on.

407
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,430
Like it or not,
I'm still the founder.

408
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,275
Like it or not, East Texas
is still my brainchild.

409
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,989
You know, you've got a lot more faith in
how the public will respond than I do.

410
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,949
Gardner.

411
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,632
I have some news.

412
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,115
Guess what?

413
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,792
You're taking me
to Bora-Bora?

414
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,631
That was a joke.
As you were.

415
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,398
They may have found
a cure for my disease.

416
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,757
Okay, mine was closer
to the truth.

417
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,239
But mine is the truth.

418
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,314
It will involve
an operation.

419
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,832
And some physical therapy.

420
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,592
Pick it up,
pick it up, pick it up.

421
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,268
You got it. You got it.
Keep going. There you go.

422
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,759
Remember what
you're running for.

423
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,478
Assuming
all goes well,

424
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,513
I'm coming to see you.

425
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,909
Cool.
When is this happening?

426
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,674
In a few months.

427
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,472
There's a lot of
travel involved.

428
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,816
Well,
don't take forever.

429
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,308
Once foster care
spits me out, I'm gone.

430
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,511
See you in
the funny papers.

431
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,195
File 32,
human courtship.

432
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,471
Here we are.
Allow me, won't you?

433
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,949
Well, I guess
chivalry's not entirely dead.

434
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,712
At least not in Nantucket.

435
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,518
At least not in Nantucket.

436
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Repeat.

437
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,256
Here we are.
Here we are.

438
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,271
Allow me, won't you?
Allow me, won't you?

439
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,856
Well, I guess
chivalry's not entirely dead.

440
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,040
Chivalry's not entirely dead.

441
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,112
At least not in Nantucket.
At least not in Nantucket.

442
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,271
Bravo. Well done.

443
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,592
Are you gonna visit
your ex-husband?

444
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,751
I hacked into
the scientist records.

445
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,716
Aren't you the clever
computer stalker.

446
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,434
Why'd you get divorced?

447
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,914
Well, he changed when we found
out I couldn't have children.

448
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,911
Uh, did that make you sad,
that you couldn't have children?

449
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,919
That's a tough one.

450
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,272
Meant I didn't have
to choose.

451
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,759
And, uh, motherhood wasn't a dream
I was chasing at that time.

452
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,710
My father is somewhere
on that thing.

453
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Earth.

454
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,792
We could go and find him.

455
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,110
We don't have
to tell him who I am.

456
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,037
I could just
see him, you know?

457
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,952
Maybe I could
ask for the time.

458
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,559
No one has to know.

459
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,392
Do you know
where he lives?

460
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,635
No.
His name?

461
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Gardner, I promise,

462
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,959
I don't know anything about him.
Nobody does.

463
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,990
How am I supposed to act on Earth,
with the people?

464
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,913
Mr. Shepherd?

465
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,156
Your coffee.

466
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,440
Excuse me, sir.

467
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,312
Do you have
an appointment? Sir!

468
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,913
Tom!
Sir!

469
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Tom!
Nathaniel.

470
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Stop!

471
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,039
What are you doing here?

472
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,519
I'm here to meet him.

473
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
Impossible.

474
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,393
No. No, what's impossible is
shuttling back and forth to Mars.

475
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,630
What's impossible is building
our salvation there.

476
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,358
But I made
those things happen.

477
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,755
So don't tell me
what's impossible.

478
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,720
Gardner?
Gardner, how are you feeling?

479
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,835
Water.

480
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,473
You okay?

481
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,480
It's water.

482
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Are you thirsty?

483
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,190
No. No, there's...
Let's get this back on.

484
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,715
There's water everywhere.

485
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,477
All right.
I feel so heavy.

486
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,113
But light.
Is that normal?

487
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,555
I believe
the term is "euphoria."

488
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,317
Sorry about
the quarantine.

489
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,310
It's to protect you
from us, not us from you.

490
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,717
Same bubble, different planet.
Nothing's changed, has it?

491
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,393
Well, except that.

492
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,839
It's so blue.

493
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,914
And green.

494
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,077
There's so many colors.

495
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,271
I'm Nathaniel Shepherd.
How you doing?

496
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,069
I'm fine.
I just weigh so much.

497
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,077
I know who you are.

498
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,393
I want to be them.

499
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,268
That's funny.

500
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,118
Because they wanna be you.

501
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,950
I got so many questions
about Mars.

502
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,198
Not as many as
I have about Earth.

503
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,713
Oh, you'd be surprised.

504
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
I'll go first.

505
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,870
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

506
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,037
Uh, rain. My turn.

507
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,634
What's your favorite
thing to do on Mars?

508
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,030
To pretend it's Earth.
My turn.

509
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,917
Did you see
my mother die?

510
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,314
No.

511
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,600
Yes.

512
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,312
Yes. I'm sorry.

513
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,920
What scares you?

514
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,914
You. You're very disarming.

515
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,150
Are you gonna keep going
out of turn? Yes.

516
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,228
Can I stay on Earth?

517
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,079
I can't answer that.

518
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Why rain?

519
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,277
Because it washes
everything clean.

520
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
Gardner...

521
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,354
Kendra.

522
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
Hello.

523
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,638
We meet in person.
Hmm.

524
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,308
How you feel?

525
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
Heavy.

526
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,656
So what's giving me some
concern are these inconsistencies

527
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,511
in this last batch of tests.
What about blood?

528
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,192
Blood work is
virtually normal.

529
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,635
But if we're going to be sure...
Virtually? Virtually?

530
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,029
Is that what we do
around here now? Virtually?

531
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,976
Because I like to think
the importance of our work

532
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,036
subscribes more to "definitely."
Meaning?

533
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,194
Meaning, troponin. Testing
for troponin is my point.

534
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,472
Run the test for
troponin, please.

535
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,632
Troponin.
Troponin it is.

536
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
Hey.

537
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,471
They need to do more tests.

538
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,472
They already did their tests.
They said I'm fine.

539
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,232
I know. I know.
I'm more than fine.

540
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,360
Hey.

541
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,696
They're sending me back
to Mars, aren't they?

542
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,073
They didn't say that.

543
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,236
Well, they don't have to.

544
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,552
There's been a breach.
Where?

545
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,914
Quarantine.

546
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,272
Word of warning, guys.
These are the real deal.

547
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,034
The boots are weighted
for gravity compensation,

548
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,554
as if you were from Mars
returning to Earth.

549
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,794
It's going to feel
very different.

550
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,714
I don't believe this.
He's tipped the pressure!

551
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,711
Raised by scientists.

552
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,189
Lock it down.
This is not a drill.

553
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
There he is!

554
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,635
Where's that go?

555
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,475
Zone H. He's headed
to Service.

556
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,717
Relax. It's a dead end.

557
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,680
Okay.

558
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
He changed.

559
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,918
Okay, guys, check
the loading dock.

560
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,720
Thanks.

561
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,677
All right,
you can go.

562
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,073
I have to talk to you.

563
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,356
Gardner trusts me,
he doesn't trust you.

564
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,635
Kendra, give me a minute.

565
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,308
We need teams at the Washington
Avenue Amtrak Station,

566
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,470
the airport, and cover
the bus stations, yeah?

567
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
You got it.

568
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,749
I'm coming with you.

569
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,916
Kendra, thank you,
but I am good.

570
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,036
State police are helping
with blockades.

571
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,430
They've been told
he needs a heart transplant

572
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,391
and a donor's suddenly
become available.

573
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,875
I promise I will
keep you updated.

574
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,960
You claim to be concerned
about Gardner's health,

575
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,230
but I think you care more
about keeping him secret.

576
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,239
You were saying?

577
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,868
It's one of
four ambulances.

578
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,235
Come on!

579
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,797
You found Waldo.

580
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,637
I'm Gardner.

581
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,710
This fire, it's so warm.

582
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,839
I like your shades.

583
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,353
I like yours.

584
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,515
You wanna trade?

585
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,830
Do you know
where Colorado is?

586
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,759
Used to.

587
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,355
Greyhound station's about a
three iron in that direction.

588
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,195
Golf reference.
Do you play?

589
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,634
Used to.

590
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,555
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

591
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,155
Dreaming. How 'bout you?

592
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,191
So far, uh,

593
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,994
meeting you.

594
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,199
Weird kid.

595
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,871
Oh, this is so cool!

596
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Open.

597
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,434
Close. Open.
Open. Open, open.

598
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Close.

599
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,358
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

600
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,233
How do we know for
sure he's going to see her?

601
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,268
Because she's the only
person he knows on Earth.

602
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,238
Right. Read that to me.

603
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,152
Here she is. Uh...

604
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,152
She was left at the Tulsa,
Oklahoma Child Welfare Services

605
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,799
when she was
four years old.

606
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,992
A girl named Tulsa happened
to be abandoned in Tulsa?

607
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,229
It's a nickname.
Right.

608
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,472
She's lived in five foster
homes over the last 12 years.

609
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:06,675
She know his story?

610
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,117
He told her he was confined
to a Park Avenue penthouse

611
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,840
and had
osteogenesis imperfecta.

612
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,509
Brittle bones.

613
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,431
Put the address
in the Sat-Trac.

614
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,511
We'll land close,
but not too close.

615
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,073
I don't wanna spook him.

616
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,880
Hi.

617
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,119
Hi. Hello.
Get away from me.

618
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,280
Okay.

619
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
Gentlemen.

620
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,071
Tulsa? Tulsa.

621
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,989
It's me.

622
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,752
It's Gardner.

623
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,920
Ow! What was that for?

624
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,752
Why did you
ghost me like that?

625
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
Ghost?

626
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,976
Yeah, you completely
blew me off.

627
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,440
You didn't return
any of my messages.

628
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,158
I told you,
I was taking a trip.

629
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,056
For seven months?
People have phones, you know?

630
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,354
You can text, email.

631
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,714
I couldn't contact you.

632
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,434
It was a very
specific type of travel.

633
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,594
Very specific type of travel?
Who even talks like that?

634
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,274
Tulsa, can you slow down,
'cause gravity is very heavy.

635
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,280
Oh, I'm sorry that this is heavy for
you, but I really do not appreciate

636
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,510
being blown off by the one
person who I don't...

637
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,277
Tulsa, I would
never ghost on you.

638
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,918
Okay, I've actually gone through
quite a lot to get here.

639
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,391
The only person who what?

640
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,792
Who I don't hate.

641
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,471
You're taller than
I thought you'd be.

642
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,358
You're meaner than
I thought you'd be.

643
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,800
What are you wearing?
This is so weird.

644
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,552
Look, I have a lab, okay?
So, I don't know.

645
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,792
Um... Can you just
stay here, all right?

646
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,235
Do not move, Gardner.

647
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,835
And those were the highlights of the
19th century Industrial Revolution.

648
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,360
Now, the 20th century had some
of the greatest inventions...

649
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,473
Hello.

650
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
Hello.

651
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,518
And you are?
Gardner.

652
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,750
Are you a transfer student?
Okay.

653
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,040
Where are you from, Gardner?

654
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,200
East Texas.

655
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,296
I don't think
I have you on my roster.

656
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,320
Okay.

657
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,110
All right, folks.
Telephone, phonograph...

658
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,216
I told you
to wait for me.

659
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,336
...movie camera,
light bulb...

660
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,360
I've waited long enough.

661
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,456
...were all inventions
of one father.

662
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,515
Who is he?

663
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Thomas Edison.

664
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,796
Good. Give me one fact
about Thomas Edison.

665
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,872
The dude was bad-ass.

666
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,838
Edison wasn't a bad-ass.

667
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,920
Excuse me?

668
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,799
Edison invented
direct current,

669
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,872
but it was Nikola Tesla who
invented alternating current.

670
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,033
Edison got jealous and claimed
AC electrocuted pets.

671
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,555
To prove it,
he electrocuted an elephant.

672
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,230
That's not bad-ass,
that's a bad person.

673
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,200
You see, folks? You learn
something new every day.

674
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,356
Thank you, uh...

675
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,160
Excuse me. That's our
emergency eye wash station.

676
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Okay.

677
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,911
Oh, dear.

678
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,231
So the operation worked.
You're all better now?

679
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,472
Yeah. Yeah.

680
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,399
Tell me where
you're really from.

681
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Mars.

682
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
You're from Mars?

683
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,240
Yeah.

684
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,751
All right, fine,
don't tell me.

685
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,912
Okay, look at this.
This is my mother.

686
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,431
She died.
I'm sorry.

687
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,876
What for?
It wasn't your fault.

688
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,598
It was mine.
I killed her.

689
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,910
But this is my father.
You're gonna help me find him.

690
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,599
I don't know
where he is, but...

691
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,679
Well, you have
your father's smile.

692
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,776
I found the house.

693
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:09,031
Route 14, latitude 40,
34 longitude.

694
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,155
All right.
You stay here.

695
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,840
Gardner!

696
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,991
Gardner, you need
to come with me now!

697
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,440
No.

698
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,433
We're here to help!

699
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,830
You're putting yourself
in great danger!

700
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,070
Why can't you just
leave me alone!

701
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,349
This is my life!

702
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,794
Gardner.
Gardner, please.

703
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,656
Come on, just come with us...
I'm going to find my father.

704
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,680
He's all I have.

705
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,136
Is there
another way around?

706
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,513
That's not true.
You have me.

707
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,680
No, I don't.

708
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,435
Kendra, you told me yourself,
you don't want children.

709
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,560
Gardner, that's not what I meant.
You know that.

710
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,976
You never
wanted children.

711
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,878
And I'm sorry you had
to raise me at all.

712
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,154
Hey.

713
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,640
Yeah? I'll get the van.
You go.

714
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,789
Okay.
Go!

715
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,988
Duck!
Ah!

716
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,840
Sorry!

717
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,591
Okay. All right,
you're gonna need to get in.

718
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,994
Hurry! Come on!

719
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,596
Gardner, let's go!

720
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,874
Go faster!

721
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,238
I'm trying to help him!

722
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,320
Just jump!

723
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,909
Come on.
All right, get in.

724
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,798
There you go!
There you go!

725
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,792
All right,
you may wanna hop in.

726
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,639
Whoo-hoo!

727
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,960
No!

728
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,431
Gardner,
take a seat, please.

729
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,749
- Okay.
- Gardner!

730
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,836
There you go.
All right.

731
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,435
Come on!

732
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,671
You know how to
fly this, right?

733
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,592
Nope.

734
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,240
Wow.

735
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,080
Whoa!

736
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,680
Oh, no.

737
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,960
Ah...

738
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,674
The pressure!

739
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,829
I know, right?

740
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,828
No, Gardner,
the oil pressure!

741
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,920
All right, I got 'em.

742
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,520
My God, they're
landing on a freeway.

743
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:48,312
Okay. All right, um,
it's gonna be a little tricky.

744
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,755
I usually have
a landing strip.

745
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,070
Coordinates.
I need coordinates.

746
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Tulsa.

747
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,912
Tulsa, pull up! Pull up!

748
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,600
Ah...

749
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,111
Brake! Brake!

750
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,554
It doesn't
have brakes!

751
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Whoa!

752
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,951
We're gonna have to jump.
Let's jump!

753
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,271
Oh, no.

754
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
Oh.

755
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:54,880
No.

756
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,479
Holy crap.

757
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,994
All right, we gotta go.
Come on. Come on.

758
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,155
No bodies.

759
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,313
What?
Are you sure?

760
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,760
Positive.
The fellas went through

761
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,176
the wreckage with
a fine-tooth comb.

762
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
They're alive.

763
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,154
Somewhere.

764
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,953
You had one job!

765
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,720
One job,
to protect Gardner!

766
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,876
To keep him from making contact
with the outside world.

767
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,557
Preventing exactly
this kind of eventuality.

768
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,313
You're hanging this on me?

769
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,755
I admired you
more than anyone.

770
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,640
And you wanna know what?

771
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,393
We've been shouldering
East Texas for you.

772
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,640
For years.

773
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,896
What are you trying
to say, Kendra?

774
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,230
I'm trying to say the whole
mission was your job,

775
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,475
your responsibility.

776
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,036
You just gave up.
And where were you?

777
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,675
Hey.

778
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,200
When's the Beemer
gonna be ready?

779
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,440
Later.

780
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,192
All right, well, can you
get the paperwork started?

781
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,113
Please.

782
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,600
Sir?

783
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:11,389
This is stealing.

784
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,560
Yeah, whatever.

785
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,235
It's wrong.

786
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,789
How do you suppose
we find your father?

787
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,236
You got the paperwork
on this BMW?

788
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,110
Okay.

789
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:23,696
You know, right and
wrong seem to change

790
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,948
when you really
need something.

791
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,599
Don't worry, I'll get it.

792
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,360
All right.

793
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,269
Friend of yours?

794
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,908
Where are we going?

795
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,675
Anywhere off the grid.

796
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:09,995
Disabling the phone.

797
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,672
Okay.

798
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,591
So, uh, Gardner,

799
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,910
when you said that
you killed your mother,

800
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,479
what exactly did
you mean by that?

801
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,831
She died giving birth to me.

802
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,591
That doesn't mean
that you killed her.

803
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,989
So, who's that guy?

804
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,435
He founded East Texas.
Where I'm from.

805
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,480
Well, I thought you said
you were from New York.

806
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,438
Who was the woman? Kendra?
She's an astronaut.

807
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,629
Who you know from Mars?
Yeah.

808
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,358
You know what, get out.

809
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,680
Get out.

810
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,835
Get out!

811
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,360
I don't understand...

812
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,556
You know, I don't like
to be played, Gardner.

813
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,191
That's what it is. Mars?
Some weird disease?

814
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,868
People have been lying
to me my entire life,

815
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,793
which is whatever, 'cause people suck.
They suck. They lie.

816
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,240
They use you to
get what they want,

817
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,679
and then they just
throw you away.

818
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,877
And the thing is,
I didn't even like Calculus.

819
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,638
No, just Mr. Hall's
always drunk

820
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,056
and nobody can understand
what he's saying,

821
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,696
but he doesn't care
what we do on our computers.

822
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,597
Tulsa... So that's what
I looked forward to.

823
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,876
Tulsa, I'm not... To Calculus.
To talking to you.

824
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,234
So get out!

825
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:26,238
Tulsa, I'm not lying to you.

826
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,834
My mother was an astronaut.
She made a mistake.

827
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,308
I was born on Mars.

828
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:34,718
Just because people lied to you before,
it doesn't mean I'm lying now.

829
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,275
And just because something
sounds crazy to you,

830
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,753
doesn't mean it's not true.

831
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,431
So if you really wanna get rid
of me, you have to get out.

832
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,198
Because I'm gonna
find my father.

833
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:51,108
You know, when people talk to me
that way, they get their ass kicked.

834
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,593
Try it. I'm rockin'
this gravity.

835
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,399
Okay. Maybe you actually
believe it yourself.

836
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,349
What?

837
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,879
I'm sorry.

838
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,040
For what?

839
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,795
For people lying.
For people sucking things.

840
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,234
I'm sorry you're angry.

841
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:15,958
I'm not angry.

842
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,960
No.

843
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,028
Allow me, won't you?

844
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,949
What are you doing?

845
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,317
Chivalry's not dead.
At least not in Nantucket.

846
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:41,591
I'm on a road trip
with an insane person.

847
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Whoa!

848
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,638
What is...

849
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,799
It's just a horse.

850
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,193
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

851
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:24,873
We should not
be doing this.

852
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,616
Well, we need a device
that's not being traced.

853
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,710
You wanna know where
your father is, right?

854
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,029
Okay.

855
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,876
Hey, it's unlocked.
Consider yourself lucky.

856
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,996
I consider myself
a criminal.

857
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,080
Okay.

858
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,400
Well, there was a Sarah
Elliot who was an astronaut.

859
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,714
Yeah.
I'll give ya that.

860
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,955
It says
she died tragically

861
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,000
from pressure suit failure
shortly after arriving.

862
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,388
Well, I'm a secret.

863
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:49,358
Yeah. Of course you are.
And I'm an enigma.

864
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,709
Same person.

865
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,216
I know.
That's what I've been...

866
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,878
Damn it!
We lost connection.

867
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,376
Yup, they're
pretty cheap here.

868
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,470
Your best option is
disabling all the decoys

869
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,516
and piggybacking off
the firehouse next door.

870
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,520
Right.

871
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:05,468
Oh, cool. Thanks.

872
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,516
Pay for my wrap
and I won't tell.

873
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,197
No, no, no, we don't
have money. I'm sorry.

874
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,360
We have money.

875
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,816
Great. Why don't
you say that louder?

876
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,840
We have money!

877
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,073
No, no. Sorry, sorry,
he doesn't speak sarcasm.

878
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:20,754
Here, take it.

879
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,078
My mother was wearing this
when she died.

880
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,879
It's some sort
of ring, I think.

881
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,273
It's like half a ring.
Part of a bigger ring?

882
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,279
There's words on it.
Let's see.

883
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,678
These words are
in Havasupai.

884
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,032
An Indian tribe
in Arizona.

885
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,038
Yup. It's signed.
Shaman Neka.

886
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,428
Gardner, I think this is
some kind of wedding ring.

887
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,711
And he married them.
That's Shaman Neka.

888
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,110
All right.
How far is Arizona?

889
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,998
Smile.

890
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,271
Oh, no.

891
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,234
Oh, not smiling. Running.
Come on. Let's go.

892
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,953
Two teenagers
spotted last night.

893
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,280
We think
they're still in there.

894
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,600
Where is he?

895
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,896
- Sir, you gotta calm...
- Stop it!

896
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,955
What have...
Let her go!

897
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,076
- Hey!
- We got him.

898
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,069
Are you okay?

899
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,113
Nathaniel. Nathaniel.

900
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,148
Talk to me.

901
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,313
What's going on?

902
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,193
You're right, Kendra.

903
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:56,999
I gave up.

904
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:59,469
I withdrew.

905
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,955
And the greater the pressure to
reemerge, the more I retreated.

906
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:10,319
As long as he was just a face, on the
screen, I could almost handle it,

907
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,679
sentencing a boy to a life
he never asked for.

908
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:18,029
But it's like the malignancy of any
secret, it just kept getting worse.

909
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,711
Every time I go over it, what
I did, the choices I made...

910
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,536
I swear, I couldn't
have done anything else.

911
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,278
But that's not the point.

912
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,117
I dealt with the problem.

913
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,237
I just had no idea what
the solution would do to me.

914
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,028
It killed me.

915
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,870
And it's still killing me.

916
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,231
I need to make this right.

917
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,989
Yes.

918
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,356
Gardner's blood has elevated
levels of troponin.

919
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,192
The news is
not good, Kendra.

920
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,235
Thank you.

921
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,238
Talk to me about troponin.

922
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,600
What?

923
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,990
Elevated troponin
and Gardner.

924
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,080
Oh.

925
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,160
His myositic pool
was depleted.

926
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,429
I read the chart.

927
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,136
It's not necessarily
a problem on its own,

928
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:23,119
but in conjunction with
elevated levels of troponin...

929
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,228
He's suffering
from an enlarged heart.

930
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,918
His heart can't handle
our atmosphere.

931
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:31,509
Our gravity.

932
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,798
He's running out of time.

933
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,280
Is that a balloon?

934
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,437
Tulsa, there's a balloon!
Yeah.

935
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,795
Tulsa, there's a balloon
up there!

936
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,949
All right, all right.

937
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,155
Wow, it's huge!

938
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,238
Burgers and balloons.

939
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,436
You really gotta slow down.
That's your fifth?

940
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,874
These taste so good.

941
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,593
Hey, uh,
can you check in there,

942
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,318
just see
if there's any cash?

943
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,948
In here?
Yup.

944
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,276
Cowboys always
stash away a few bucks.

945
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,798
No, that's for your mouth.
You just gotta blow in it.

946
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,311
No, you gotta... Yeah.

947
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,840
There ya go.
So cool.

948
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,120
Nice.

949
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,116
There ya go.

950
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,440
Uh...

951
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,479
You got schmutz
on your face.

952
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:44,920
All right.

953
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,352
Thanks.
Yeah.

954
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,314
All right. Go change.

955
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,791
Relax, this place has like a million
stores and a trillion dollars.

956
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,880
No, there are cameras...

957
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,096
All right,
all right, all right.

958
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:19,536
But, look, this is
the last of our money.

959
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:23,473
So, we'll buy the clothes,
then change.

960
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,960
Hey.

961
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:11,916
Break my heart

962
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,875
Break my hands

963
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,597
You can take anything
but my plans

964
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:29,434
I've got big things to do

965
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,634
You can laugh

966
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,916
Have your fun

967
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,550
I'll be standing right here
when you're done

968
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,799
Oh, oh...

969
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,790
I've got big things...

970
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Yo.

971
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,868
Is that your song?

972
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:57,635
Maybe.

973
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,989
It's beautiful.

974
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:00,480
Whatever.

975
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:11,798
What goes on in there?

976
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,988
I don't know.

977
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,999
Got us some sleeping bags.

978
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,639
Ready?
Yeah.

979
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,590
Oh, and I'm driving
this time.

980
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,113
In your dreams.

981
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,079
Excuse me, sir.

982
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,272
Play that again.

983
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:45,633
They're moving aimlessly.

984
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,991
Why New Mexico?

985
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,394
Both hands on the wheel.
Both eyes on the road.

986
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,310
Dude, do you have a problem?

987
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,816
'Cause you've definitely been looking
at me for the last four hours

988
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,796
and it's starting
to freak me out.

989
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,195
You're so beautiful.

990
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,836
And then you blurt that out,
just like that? What?

991
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,479
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

992
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,599
Uh... Because you may wanna
just play it cool, you know?

993
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,876
Ease yourself
into the love game.

994
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,712
But I do think
you're beautiful.

995
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,797
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.

996
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,598
Okay, just
slow your roll, kid.

997
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,799
You gotta calm down.

998
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,632
I don't wanna calm down.

999
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,200
And I don't understand why
this is making you so upset.

1000
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,992
Hey, first of all,
I'm not upset.

1001
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,680
I am uncomfortable.
There's a difference.

1002
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,438
Secondly,
people don't go around

1003
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,351
saying what they feel
whenever they feel it.

1004
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,593
They have guards and shields
and other metaphors.

1005
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,274
Why?
Because we're all messed up

1006
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,520
and scared and trying to be
something that we're not.

1007
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,114
And if we all went around just
declaring our innermost desires

1008
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,576
to the exact people
we felt them for,

1009
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,273
well, then we'd all end up
happy, or something.

1010
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,755
Look, Gardner...

1011
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:26,074
I'm happy that
you think I'm beautiful

1012
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,560
and I've kind of had
an amazing time with you.

1013
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,881
But the last thing I'm gonna
do is actually tell you that.

1014
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,120
You just did.

1015
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:37,960
You're blushing.

1016
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,870
I'm not blushing.

1017
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,672
Both hands on the wheel?

1018
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:09,315
No.

1019
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,349
What is happening?

1020
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:20,433
This is... I believe the
term is "euphoria."

1021
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,598
I got an idea.

1022
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,959
Hail in the southern
desert, extending from Las...

1023
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:31,748
Close your eyes.

1024
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,910
How did you just become more
beautiful in 20 seconds?

1025
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,949
Do you wanna kiss me?

1026
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:10,960
Yeah.

1027
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,632
But I don't know how.

1028
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,478
You will.

1029
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,309
You don't understand.

1030
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,477
On Mars, people,
they didn't do this.

1031
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:48,394
We just had scientists and
they studied ground samples.

1032
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,751
Shut up, Gardner.

1033
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,518
I thought about you
every day, up there.

1034
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,599
I know
what's gonna happen.

1035
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:05,200
What?

1036
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,590
I'm gonna fall in love with
you and I'll fall to Earth.

1037
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,272
I'll be just like you.

1038
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,273
That old line.

1039
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,873
Okay, I'll shut up now.
No, no, no.

1040
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:19,959
Hold that thought.

1041
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:25,554
To myself?

1042
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,913
All my life,
I couldn't feel anything.

1043
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,435
I couldn't feel water.
I couldn't feel a fire.

1044
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:29,239
I couldn't feel
wind on my face.

1045
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,192
And now I can.

1046
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:37,352
That's nothing compared to
what I feel with you.

1047
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,110
I was so scared

1048
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,276
I wouldn't know
how to be human.

1049
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,073
You make me human, Tulsa.

1050
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,996
Well, that's incredible.

1051
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,754
I know, right?

1052
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,479
It has so many legs.

1053
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:36,240
Oh.

1054
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,117
Everything's cool!

1055
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,277
This is reservation property.

1056
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,597
The tourist lookout
is 15 miles that way.

1057
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,760
Yeah, we know. Um...

1058
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,194
And we hope
we're not intruding,

1059
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,117
but we're looking
for Shaman Neka.

1060
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,679
Right on!

1061
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,434
When you know, you know!

1062
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:58,038
Know what?
I am not sure.

1063
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,519
Come on!

1064
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,791
I've married many couples.

1065
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,030
Well, there were
no state records.

1066
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:15,872
Um... Do you keep any?

1067
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,359
I'd keep her.

1068
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:22,479
What was her name?

1069
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,518
Sarah Elliot.

1070
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,473
Sarah.

1071
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:32,158
- So, I made this ring 16 years ago.
- Stop. Stop!

1072
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,713
The other half of this ring
is with your father.

1073
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,630
This is the check.

1074
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,149
It doesn't say his name.

1075
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,674
No, she paid.
That's her address.

1076
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:45,915
Do you have that photo?

1077
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,496
Do you mind if
I borrow your computer?

1078
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,520
Not at all.
Okay, great.

1079
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,355
Okay.

1080
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,552
Summerland, California.

1081
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:00,920
Huh.

1082
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,593
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1083
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,598
I think this is it.

1084
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,272
Yeah, one second,
I think that's...

1085
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,035
We found it.

1086
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,280
Well, let's go.

1087
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,791
You look like crap.
You okay?

1088
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:01,160
Yeah.

1089
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:03,479
Do you know
where we're going?

1090
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,120
Oh, yeah.

1091
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,437
Paris, Venice,
and Cairo.

1092
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,160
Hello. Checking in?

1093
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:25,296
Hi. Uh, we just left
the keys in the ignition.

1094
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,639
Checking in.
Thank you.

1095
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:27,800
You're welcome.

1096
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:31,231
Well, you wanted
to see the world.

1097
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,873
Here you have it.

1098
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,230
It's like a big toy.

1099
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,556
No, no, no, look.

1100
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:42,359
That's Paris.
New York. Shanghai.

1101
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,232
And look over there,
Venice.

1102
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,159
It feels weird.

1103
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:51,316
I mean,
it's not real, you know?

1104
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:54,677
It's not
how I pictured it.

1105
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,190
It's hurting my head
to see it like this.

1106
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,799
Well, I'm sorry,
Gardner,

1107
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,190
but the world doesn't always
give you exactly what you want.

1108
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,349
It gave me you.

1109
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,110
All right, let me be
cynical for one second.

1110
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,630
Tulsa, just because
your parents are gone,

1111
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:22,075
it doesn't mean
you can't have a family.

1112
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,550
We can be
each other's family.

1113
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,714
'Cause this isn't...

1114
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,914
This isn't real,
but we can be real.

1115
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:32,400
Okay.

1116
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,400
I think it's time to go.
Let's get you to California.

1117
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:36,555
You hear what I said?

1118
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,113
Whoa. Yeah, I did. Uh...

1119
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:40,520
But, Gardner,
I think you're sick.

1120
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,596
None of this was how it was
in my head.

1121
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:43,816
You need to
go to the hospital.

1122
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,376
Except you. We need to
get you to a hospital.

1123
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:46,480
Something's wrong with you.

1124
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,078
Gardner. Gardner.

1125
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,595
No, no! Gardner,
Gardner, Gardner!

1126
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,034
You're okay,
you're okay.

1127
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,355
Please help!

1128
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,600
I wanna scan him.

1129
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,200
Okay. Radiology, stat.

1130
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,515
What's his name?

1131
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,040
Gardner.

1132
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,793
What's his last name?

1133
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,598
I don't know.

1134
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,671
Well, where's he from?
Uh...

1135
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:14,720
Uh...

1136
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,918
I don't know.

1137
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:26,949
What the...

1138
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:29,269
Look at this.

1139
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,200
I've never seen
anything like it before.

1140
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,791
Oh, my God,
what is that?

1141
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,315
His heart is
grossly enlarged.

1142
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:41,391
I gave him
some valsartan, but...

1143
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,953
It doesn't look good.

1144
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,232
He wasn't lying.

1145
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:52,760
Gardner.

1146
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,592
Gardner, I have to go.

1147
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,958
Social Services are coming.

1148
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,277
But I'm gonna
go to Summerland.

1149
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,673
I'm gonna find your father.

1150
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,234
And I'm gonna tell him
how amazing you are.

1151
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,239
How much you think about him

1152
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,915
and how badly you wanted
to go there. Okay?

1153
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,600
I promise.

1154
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,831
Hey. Hey.

1155
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,496
- We need to go.
- No, no.

1156
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,999
We need to go.
You can't. You can't.

1157
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,600
You have to stay here.

1158
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,160
Gardner.

1159
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,112
Do you even know
why you're sick?

1160
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,789
'Cause your heart's too big.

1161
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:50,016
We are going to Summerland.

1162
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,871
You can't.
They're gonna help you.

1163
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,713
There's nothing they can do.

1164
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,878
They can't. Don't you see?

1165
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,633
No matter how much
I want Earth,

1166
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,870
Earth doesn't want me.

1167
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,040
Hold on a sec.
I'll get my bag.

1168
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,669
Hang on, Pop.

1169
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,437
Social Services.
Thank God.

1170
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,434
They used a credit
card the owner left in the car.

1171
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:05,435
They're headed north,
in California.

1172
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,193
I know where they're going.

1173
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,440
Good evening.

1174
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,234
Gardner?

1175
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,920
Gardner!

1176
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,433
I'm not dead.

1177
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,709
Scared me.

1178
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,595
You act like you hate
the world so much, Tulsa.

1179
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,793
Save your strength.

1180
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:41,119
It's all an act.

1181
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,992
The beautiful music you make
gives you away.

1182
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,519
Gardner, we're here.

1183
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:27,520
Hey.

1184
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:32,190
Hey, we're here.

1185
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,639
Will you help me?

1186
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,039
Yeah, of course.

1187
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,360
Help you what?

1188
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:42,678
Just look better.

1189
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,080
Here.

1190
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,675
This is the best place
I've been so far.

1191
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,512
You ready?

1192
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,428
Yeah.

1193
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,913
He's gonna love you.

1194
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:54,960
Hello?

1195
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:26,639
Hello?
Hi.

1196
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,837
Can I help you?

1197
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:33,755
Now would be a good
time to say something.

1198
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,160
Um...

1199
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,919
Where did you get this photo?

1200
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,353
East Texas.

1201
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,839
That's impossible.

1202
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,072
My mother was Sarah Elliot.
She died giving birth to me.

1203
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:02,114
Sarah Elliot died
from pressure suit failure.

1204
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:04,430
That's not... That's
what they said, but...

1205
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,438
You're my father.

1206
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,874
Is this some kind of scam?

1207
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,110
No, he's not lying.
It's the truth, I swear.

1208
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,428
I just wanted
to meet you.

1209
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,440
Why are you doing this to me?

1210
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:24,350
I'm not your father.
I'm calling the police.

1211
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,039
Okay, just stay
right here.

1212
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,836
Stop being a dick! Okay.

1213
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:29,920
Look, he risked his life

1214
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,110
to leave the one place
he's ever known, all alone,

1215
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,595
didn't know anybody,
never set foot on this planet.

1216
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,336
I mean, how scary is that?
What do you want from me?

1217
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,360
I could never do that.

1218
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,238
Look...
Just to meet you.

1219
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,833
And he's dying.

1220
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:44,393
I don't know who you are,
or why you're doing this.

1221
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:45,560
I am not his father.

1222
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,960
Well, then who are you,
because that is you in the photo,

1223
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,355
and that is this house.
Yes, this is the house.

1224
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,397
Our parents left it to us.

1225
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:57,550
Sarah Elliot was my sister.

1226
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,229
Oh. You gotta get some help.
Please, get some help!

1227
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,360
Gardner!

1228
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,080
Gardner!

1229
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,069
Gardner!

1230
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:14,760
Gardner!

1231
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,399
No, he's not
your father.

1232
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,158
He's not your father.
He's your uncle.

1233
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,958
It doesn't matter anymore.

1234
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,078
There's no time left, Tulsa.

1235
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,576
Okay, let's just go back.
He's gonna call the ambulance.

1236
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,591
You'll get better.
My mother's here.

1237
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,118
I can feel her.

1238
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,797
I didn't get to choose
where I was born.

1239
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,431
But I get to choose
where I die.

1240
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:52,120
Tulsa.

1241
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,108
Yes, Gardner?

1242
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,957
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?

1243
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,156
You are, Gardner.

1244
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,391
See you in the funny papers.

1245
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,550
Gardner! Gardner!

1246
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,399
No, no! Gardner!
No, Gardner!

1247
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,433
No, Gardner, no!

1248
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,431
No, Gardner!

1249
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,037
I got him!

1250
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,591
Kendra! Help me!

1251
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,312
Okay.
Let's move him over.

1252
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,800
- There we go.
- Turn him over.

1253
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,949
Come on.

1254
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,951
Okay, come on.

1255
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,376
Gardner.
You can do it.

1256
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:25,834
Gardner! Gardner!

1257
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,513
Gardner, stay with me.

1258
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:28,800
Don't leave us!

1259
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:30,952
Come on. Come on.

1260
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:37,513
What was she like?

1261
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,559
My mother.

1262
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,593
She was fearless.

1263
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:53,398
She was kind.

1264
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:59,071
And she just
seemed so invincible.

1265
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,831
And she made me wanna
give up living when she died.

1266
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,555
You loved her.

1267
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:13,280
Yes.

1268
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,553
You're my father.

1269
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,120
Yes.

1270
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:24,560
There they are!

1271
01:43:25,120 --> 01:43:27,714
Hurry! There's no time!

1272
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:31,632
I knew I would find you.

1273
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,552
You're gonna be okay.

1274
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:35,439
You're not alone.

1275
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,599
Stay with me, Gardner.

1276
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,109
Hurry!

1277
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:19,276
It's taking too long.

1278
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,640
His blood pressure's
dropping.

1279
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,597
We have to get him
out of our gravity.

1280
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,832
You have to take
the plane higher.

1281
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:30,318
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1282
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:31,595
You know I can't do that.

1283
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,750
That's against
all regulations.

1284
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,599
I'm taking control.

1285
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:42,955
What are you doing?

1286
01:44:43,640 --> 01:44:44,856
I'm taking us into
the stratosphere.

1287
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:45,880
Excuse me?

1288
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,157
Yeah, don't worry.
She can handle it.

1289
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,156
Although I warn you, one of
you may need to take over.

1290
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,320
One of us may need to...

1291
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,157
Yeah, there's a chance
that I may die.

1292
01:44:57,800 --> 01:44:59,313
But you've done this before?
Yes.

1293
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:00,714
All the time.

1294
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:02,800
Virtually.

1295
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,188
Great.

1296
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:05,799
Buckle in.

1297
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,198
All right,
let's buckle you in.

1298
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,016
Uh... Yeah, just get ready.
Come on.

1299
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:11,314
Grab this strap
right there.

1300
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,471
I have the aircraft.

1301
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:40,878
No, we gotta go higher.

1302
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,632
Try and wake him up.

1303
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:42,551
Gardner. Gardner,
wake up! Gardner!

1304
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,118
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1305
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,838
Stay in. Stay in.
I've got him.

1306
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,434
Are we on my planet?

1307
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:22,480
No.

1308
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,911
Are we on yours?

1309
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,280
No.

1310
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,351
Are you ever gonna
stop slapping me?

1311
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,314
You have to go back.

1312
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,557
No, Tulsa, don't...
I hate it. I hate it.

1313
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,398
But, Gardner, we both know

1314
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,872
you have to go back.

1315
01:47:57,960 --> 01:47:59,473
I love you, Tulsa.

1316
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,871
And I love you.

1317
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,080
How's he doing?

1318
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:26,918
Stable, for now.

1319
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:28,991
It should buy us
the time we need.

1320
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:31,230
And you? You okay?

1321
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,991
Apparently.

1322
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,911
This is good to know.
Uh-huh.

1323
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,918
I'm gonna miss you, Gardner.

1324
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:14,030
More than anything else
in the world.

1325
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:19,235
Me too.

1326
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,917
You're the best mom
I never had.

1327
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:28,710
Safe travels, okay?

1328
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:38,312
Oh, miss. Hold up, miss.
Hey!

1329
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,311
Miss, you can't
go up there.

1330
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:46,479
Nice ride.

1331
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,751
Are you gonna be okay?

1332
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:56,638
You're amazing.

1333
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,071
And I had the time
of my life with you.

1334
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:06,515
But the last thing I'm
gonna do is actually tell you that.

1335
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,511
You just did.

1336
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:26,033
T-minus ten. Nine. Eight.

1337
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:30,713
Seven. Six. Five.

1338
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,271
Four. Three. Two.

1339
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:37,634
One. Zero.

1340
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,033
Ignition. Liftoff.

1341
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,390
Same time tomorrow?

1342
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,238
Works for me.

1343
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,440
Tulsa.

1344
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:21,432
You have a visitor.

1345
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:23,960
Um...

1346
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:25,600
Bye.

1347
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:26,909
Gotta go.

1348
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:36,872
Hey.
Hi.

1349
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:41,910
So, as you probably know,
I've retired from NASA.

1350
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:44,038
Well, not really.

1351
01:51:44,120 --> 01:51:46,270
I'm running
their training program now.

1352
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:48,113
And it's been great.

1353
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,909
I mean, getting re-accustomed to living
on this planet's been a little trying.

1354
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,271
Anyway, um,
I'm getting off track. Um...

1355
01:51:56,200 --> 01:51:58,031
Since I couldn't
spend any money on Mars,

1356
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:00,429
and I was up there
for six years,

1357
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,477
it turns out
I actually have a lot of it.

1358
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:06,792
So, I bought a ranch house
in Boulder, Colorado.

1359
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:10,316
Mmm. I like to ski and the
people are really nice.

1360
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:15,149
Yeah, it's a pretty big house.
Gets lonely at times.

1361
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,596
Would you like to
come live with me there?

1362
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,153
Are you getting paid?

1363
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:27,395
To take me?

1364
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,309
Oh, God, no.

1365
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,752
No.

1366
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:34,149
'Cause I age out
in a month.

1367
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,915
Who said anything
about only a month?

1368
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,032
I wanted to go to Earth.

1369
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,353
Not just to visit,
but to live there.

1370
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:09,113
It turns out,

1371
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:11,510
people from Earth
want exactly the same thing

1372
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,954
as people from Mars.

1373
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,950
And I should know, because I'm
pretty sure I'm the only one.

1374
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:19,635
So far.

1375
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:25,835
I don't know which is better,
but here's what I do know.

1376
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:28,952
It's good to be home.

1376
01:53:29,305 --> 01:54:29,869
