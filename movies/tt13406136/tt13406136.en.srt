Who are the real-world Illuminati ?

2
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,149
What?

3
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,212
Come on, then.

4
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,923
Clear!

5
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,633
See if she's in here.

6
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,012
All right, come on. You're nearly there.

7
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,975
Go on, then. Open it.

8
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,987
- Right.
- Right.

9
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
So, this is the princess.

10
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,911
All pure for her wedding.

11
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,831
I haven't been close
to the princess before.

12
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,584
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

13
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,630
No, don't.

14
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,883
If you wake her up,
I'm gonna break your face.

15
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:37,968
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,684
Oh, here we go.

17
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,732
Got a little fight in you, eh?

18
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,025
Just get her back to bed.

19
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,070
What's she doing?

20
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,680
Grab her.

21
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,392
Whoa.

22
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,060
Come on.

23
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,563
Yeah!

24
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,025
You're gonna get married, like it or not.

25
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,989
Stop messing around.

26
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,283
Get her back in bed.

27
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,386
All right.

28
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,680
Fun's over.

29
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,766
Get back here!

30
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,564
Come here, you little bitch.

31
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:30,997
I've got you now.

32
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,181
You think you're gonna make it
all the way to the bottom?

33
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:33,935
I'll see you there.

34
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,826
Might be in here.
Looks like she might be in here.

35
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,038
- I can hear something.
- No.

36
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,290
What's going on in there?

37
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,477
All right! This way!

38
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,895
Get moving!

39
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,272
On your knees.

40
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,399
Close those doors!

41
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,068
- Quiet. On the floor.
- Lock everything down.

42
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,153
Shut up.

43
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,780
- Get this off the floor.
- Sit!

44
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,701
Get that lock in place!

45
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,495
Come on! Close the door.

46
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,664
No one gets in or out!

47
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:01,958
- Quickly!
- Move!

48
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,418
Lock it down!

49
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,919
What are you looking at?

50
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,422
- Come on! Move it!
- On the floor.

51
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,674
Castle is secure, sir.

52
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,509
Get down, now!

53
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,928
Told ya, move! Come along!

54
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,483
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

55
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
I don't believe that for a moment.

56
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,571
Julius, if your father could see...

57
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,655
My father?

58
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,949
My father?

59
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,035
Your father was a diplomat.

60
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,829
You two were cut from the same cloth.

61
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,457
Weak.

62
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,208
Pathetic.

63
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,878
- Pacifiers, placaters.
- We trusted you.

64
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,588
You talk to me about trust?

65
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,381
You can't have my sister.

66
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,260
Well, my little princess,

67
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,682
I will marry your sister
because I always get what I want.

68
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,944
Listen and obey.

69
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,155
Like a child should.

70
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,495
Now, now.

71
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,916
We shouldn't be surprised
that this so-called king

72
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,419
abides the bad behavior of his daughters.

73
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,091
You have no respect
for the order of things.

74
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,301
You have trampled
our cherished traditions.

75
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,303
You have welcomed outsiders.

76
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,598
A true king should've conquered them.

77
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,270
You have made us look vulnerable
in the eyes of our enemy.

78
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,731
Julius, listen to me.
No one can rule by fear for long.

79
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,193
The people are not cattle.
They will not follow you blindly.

80
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,653
Oh, "the people."

81
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,366
People don't know what they want
until they see it.

82
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,828
Strength on the throne,
that is what "the people" crave.

83
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,707
Today, they shall have it.

84
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,003
As you were.

85
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,672
You, get them. Move!

86
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,550
- All right, come.
- Come on! Get on your feet.

87
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,843
- Come on. Get up.
- Come on.

88
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,388
- Chop-chop. Come on.
- Come on, move! Move it!

89
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,932
This is all my fault.

90
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,698
You are old enough now to understand.

91
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,367
This kingdom, it has no heir.

92
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,370
You will find it in yourself
to do your duty.

93
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:01,888
I am so honored
that you have chosen me as your son.

94
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,767
And to be given the vast responsibility

95
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,936
of becoming the true leader
of this kingdom.

96
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,071
I'd like to offer you this small token.

97
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,122
I…

98
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,668
I'm s... I'm sorry.

99
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,693
Hang on. I gotta take a piss.

100
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,800
Oh, yeah.

101
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,847
Mm-hmm.

102
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,906
Huh?

103
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,242
Well, what do we have here?

104
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,539
Yeah, looking good.

105
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,296
Oh, yeah.

106
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,141
All right, then.

107
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,480
Where are you at? Get in here, now.

108
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,407
- Oi, get that door now! Move!
- Go!

109
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,492
Get a bag to put it in!

110
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,869
Search every room!

111
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,875
Oi, come over here.

112
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,547
Plenty of bounty in here, boys.

113
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,550
Come on! This way!

114
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,429
Pick it up. Come on. Pick it up.

115
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,391
Hurry up!

116
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,227
The hallway's secure.
Move up to the next floor.

117
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,948
You should be locked up
with the others.

118
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,259
Oh, damn. Well, that usually works.

119
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,826
Someone needs to teach you your place.

120
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,621
I've heard that before.

121
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,924
Get off me!

122
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,670
I want to be a great warrior.
Like you were, Linh.

123
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:12,300
A true warrior is defined
not by how she fights…

124
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,343
Through calm, find your center.

125
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,346
…but by what she is fighting for.

126
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,434
What on earth are you two doing?

127
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,686
Your Majesty.

128
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,813
You're supposed to be learning etiquette.

129
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,065
Listen,

130
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,777
with any luck, soon I will
give the kingdom the son it needs.

131
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,904
But your education and your training

132
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,824
are no less crucial
to our family's future.

133
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,786
If I might, Your Majesty.
She is a very smart girl.

134
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,788
She can learn many things at once.

135
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,043
In future,
keep it out of view of the palace.

136
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,919
The king will not approve.

137
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,161
He washed up over there.
He must have fallen from the tower.

138
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,247
Fallen?

139
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,919
Look at the bruises. They tell the story.

140
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,422
This man didn't fall.

141
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,759
Everything else is proceeding
just as my lord planned.

142
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,427
The tower is ours.

143
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,514
The princess is dressed
and ready for the wedding.

144
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,766
Has someone checked
that she's safe and secure?

145
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,726
She's locked in. Chained.

146
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,228
Is that what I asked, Kurr?

147
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:54,151
If there is some vigilante on the loose,
you take care of it.

148
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:58,155
Otherwise,
your position is in serious jeopardy.

149
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,466
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

150
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,950
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

151
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,369
Good.

152
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:15,423
You. Come here!

153
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,139
To the top of the tower.
Check on the princess.

154
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,396
Yes. Up there. Go!

155
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,277
Warm in here.

156
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,320
- Gold. Look.
- Where?

157
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,030
- Women.
- Women's gold?

158
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,115
No.

159
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,737
- What are you doing now?
- What's that? Quickly!

160
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,697
You two, search those doors.

161
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,533
- You, with me.
- Come on, then, boy, let's go.

162
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,619
Come on. Hurry up. Through here.

163
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,665
Come on. Must be some bounty in here.

164
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,214
I can't believe she stabbed me!

165
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,302
Oh, I like a girl in lace.

166
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,825
- What has Julius done with my family?
- Fuck off.

167
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,369
Do you even know how to use this thing?

168
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,209
Watch your language.

169
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,503
You're in the presence of a princess.

170
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,216
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you anything, you bitch.

171
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,349
Don't make me ask again.

172
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,769
You're never getting out of here alive,
you cu...

173
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,859
I warned you about that mouth.

174
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,878
- Ooh, nice.
- Thank you very much.

175
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,380
There's plenty more in here!

176
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,549
Let's take it all, boys!

177
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,053
- Move!
- Out of the way, you big tub of lard.

178
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,055
Come on, then. Go through here.

179
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,891
I like the look of that!

180
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,100
Get your hands off!

181
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,394
- Let's go!
- I'm coming!

182
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,695
Come on.

183
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,990
Oh, God. Hurry up.

184
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,904
- Search!
- Come on! Quickly!

185
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,781
No bag to put it in.

186
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,742
- Hey, what you doin' over there?
- What?

187
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,285
The order is to search this way.

188
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,578
Oh, yeah, all right.

189
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,581
Come on! Go! Look everywhere.

190
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:07,423
Anything that's shiny.
Anything we can sell down the village.

191
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,926
Look, look, look. That, there.
Nice. Nice. Anything like that.

192
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,988
Get your hands off!

193
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,751
We'll be rich with all this.

194
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,130
- Come on!
- That's mine!

195
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,924
- No, give it to me!
- Come on, boys.

196
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,137
- Give me that!
- Get off it.

197
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,849
All right, all right. Calm down.
Load it up now, boy.

198
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,727
Hang on. Who put this clown in charge?

199
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,023
- Give me some of that.
- No.

200
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,858
I want it. Give me some of that.

201
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,652
No, not again.
This happens every time. No.

202
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,992
Come on, then.
Where's this food? I'm hungry.

203
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,244
We've got some wine. What do you reckon?

204
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,247
Yeah. Look at the pearls on that.
Bet that's worth…

205
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,874
- There you go. Share it.
- Yeah.

206
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,958
No, that's mine.

207
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,877
Hey, Gibsy, what you got there, then?

208
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,421
Don't hog all of it, you fat bastard.

209
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:32,466
This meat is mine.
You wanna eat? Get your own food.

210
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,888
Move quickly then, boys.

211
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,890
Julius can't get wind of this.

212
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,850
Come on. Chop-chop.

213
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,396
Sh... All right. Whatever you got.

214
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,481
- Yeah.
- Come on.

215
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,234
- What's all that rubbish you got?
- Just shut up. Come on.

216
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,152
- What?
- Keep your voice down.

217
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,582
Where's your center? Hmm?

218
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,130
No focus, no speed. Again.

219
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,304
What did I tell you?

220
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,474
You're not fighting from your heart.

221
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,684
Try it again.

222
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,775
What is he doing here?

223
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:16,486
You know Khai
as one of the king's advisers.

224
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,322
He's also my uncle

225
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,909
and the warrior who trained me
once upon a time.

226
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,958
Today, you're gonna fight us both.

227
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,085
Both?

228
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,173
You're not fighting from your heart.

229
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,527
No focus, no speed.

230
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,363
Patience and focus.

231
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,260
You were right.

232
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,470
She has a warrior's heart.

233
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,641
I cannot accept such a gift.

234
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,396
I would only entrust it
to the hands of a true warrior.

235
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:48,245
I would only entrust it
to the hands of a true warrior.

236
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,522
How are the preparations
for the wedding coming?

237
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,815
Good, sir.

238
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,442
Is everything exactly as it was?

239
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,446
The flowers, candles, ribbons?
The priests?

240
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,531
Is everything as it was that evening?

241
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,616
We'll get it done, sir.

242
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,789
…grateful salutes…

243
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,002
Of my new subjects…

244
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,717
We can finally purge this kingdom
of its weakness.

245
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,766
Then why not take the throne by force?

246
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,936
You can get what you want without her.

247
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,191
You're a valued consort of mine,

248
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,943
but politics?

249
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,112
Please.

250
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,243
There's a reason
why traditions last centuries.

251
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,746
People love tradition.

252
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,753
With her hand in mine,

253
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,923
there is not a soul that can question
that I'm the rightful king!

254
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,469
I only meant that last night
was a spectacular show of power.

255
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,970
- Yes.
- Mmm.

256
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,765
They were terrified, weren't they?

257
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,935
So… indignant.

258
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:38,271
Violence wakes people up.

259
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,070
And people will be even more terrified

260
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,990
after the coronation
when I slit the king's throat.

261
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,328
You are such a clever man.

262
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,501
I know you need to save your strength
for that limp rag of a bride.

263
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,130
Yes?

264
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,966
What is it?

265
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,010
I'm sorry, sir.

266
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,512
- The king is asking for you.
- Oh, the king?

267
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,306
The "king."

268
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,186
Well, this will be interesting.

269
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,895
Juli… …us,

270
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,689
is the pri... the prince...

271
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,069
Is she th...

272
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,281
She...

273
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,493
You seek the crown.

274
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,539
It can only hurt you in the eyes
of the very people you wish to rule.

275
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,022
And how do you think you stand
in the eyes of the people now?

276
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,668
Julius, this assault…

277
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,753
You made a promise to me.

278
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,090
A promise you recanted
on the whim of a girl.

279
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,984
Who else do you take orders from?

280
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,944
Servants?

281
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,072
Dogs?

282
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,869
Who exactly holds the power
in this kingdom?

283
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,775
We both do. You and I.

284
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,695
Julius,
let us find the solution to this together.

285
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,447
Treason will only lead to more bloodshed.

286
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,161
A wedding is not an act of treason.

287
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,374
Take him away.

288
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,861
Huh?

289
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,497
The princess?

290
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,124
She's in the tower.

291
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,459
Are you sure?

292
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,797
- Bloody hell. What's going on?
- Bloody hell did he come from?

293
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:55,398
Deal with this now.

294
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,663
Clear the tower again.

295
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:14,083
Take it floor by floor.

296
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:15,960
- Move! Let's go!
- Go! Come on! Move it!

297
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,045
Wait!

298
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,088
You.

299
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,218
Hey. We heard what he has to say.

300
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,722
You saw no sign of this man
on your way up or down?

301
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:28,932
No.

302
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,685
We're dealing with someone
who knows this place well.

303
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,270
The lord's left.

304
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,316
No one has to pretend
to listen to you now.

305
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,610
Useless harlot.

306
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,021
Not so useless now, am I?

307
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,992
I want this vigilante killed.

308
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,910
Consider no chamber clear.

309
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,620
Go!

310
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,764
Look, she's down there!

311
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,270
Don't you move, girl!

312
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,858
Come on! Hurry up!

313
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,741
Where you going, huh?

314
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,301
You're coming with us.

315
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,475
Get after her!

316
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,936
Let's get her, boys!

317
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:40,813
Get back here!

318
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,699
Get off me!

319
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,747
Oh, God.

320
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,801
Come on, boys!

321
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,889
We've got you now, girl.

322
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,463
Come on! Get up. Get her!

323
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,487
My leg!

324
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,255
Come here, you...

325
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,302
Get up!

326
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,157
Go on, get her!

327
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,707
Come on!

328
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,149
No.

329
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,584
Come on! Catch her!

330
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,672
My leg!

331
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,590
Stand back! We need her alive!

332
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:56,509
Get me down from here!

333
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,929
You! You! You let me go!

334
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,012
Shut up!

335
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,184
She's off her nut!

336
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,111
Oh, you...

337
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,386
Come on! Don't let her escape!

338
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,517
Quickly!

339
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,852
You're surrounded!

340
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,105
Come on!

341
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,787
Just move, will you!

342
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,019
He is an ideal candidate,

343
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,188
a respected lord
who will restore our standing

344
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,731
in the eyes of those who doubt us.

345
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:40,775
She's barely met him since she was a girl.

346
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,860
I understand
this does not sit well with you.

347
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,529
But this decision
has to be made strategically.

348
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,156
We have no son.

349
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,078
No heir.

350
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,955
We should arrange the wedding
as quickly as we can.

351
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,458
What else can we do?

352
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,835
I have a solution.

353
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,300
What is this?

354
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,052
I know of your plans for me.

355
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,014
And I beg of you,
let me train as a knight instead.

356
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,975
I'm afraid you have me to blame for this.

357
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,644
You condone this?

358
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,275
I never wish to see you this way again.

359
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,878
Father,
if you would just let me show you...

360
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,278
Enough.

361
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,451
You are old enough now to understand.

362
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,578
This kingdom has no heir.

363
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,165
We are all vulnerable,
every last one of us,

364
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,750
until a successor is in place.

365
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,378
- But I can be the successor.
- You're my child.

366
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:51,303
You did not honestly think
that I would send you off to die,

367
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:54,390
or worse, at the hands of some barbarian.

368
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,476
But you'll sell me into the bedroom
of a man I barely know.

369
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,230
He is an honorable lord of good family.

370
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,816
I'm not a piece of property to be traded.

371
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,614
I credited you with more maturity
than I should have.

372
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,575
Now I see

373
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,537
that you are just an impetuous girl
who only thinks about herself.

374
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,542
This kingdom is relying on you.

375
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,505
You will find it in yourself
to do your duty.

376
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,790
- Linh.
- Princess.

377
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,297
What are you doing here?

378
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,090
I was making my way to you.

379
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,054
I'm glad you're here.

380
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,724
I have something for these wounds.

381
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,394
Come.

382
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:24,855
Sit here.

383
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:30,569
My family.

384
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,112
I know.

385
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,992
Mother always said that pain is beauty.

386
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:39,703
I think she was talking about corsets.

387
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,793
This will help.

388
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:50,548
What happened, Linh?

389
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:52,925
He came in the night.

390
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,010
No one was prepared.

391
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,682
The king's guards were overrun.

392
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,769
Julius showed no mercy.

393
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,775
I managed to escape and hide,
but was one of the few.

394
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,820
He was ruthless.

395
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,618
It's all my fault.

396
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,332
Princess,

397
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,295
that kind of thinking right now
won't help.

398
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,136
I have to save them, Linh.

399
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,222
We will.

400
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,141
They're in the keep.

401
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,519
There's only one unguarded way in.

402
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,398
There's more rooms up here, lads.
Come on.

403
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,525
We need to find a way to the sewers.

404
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,737
But we have to pass
through the kitchen. Okay?

405
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,283
Go on, then. You hungry?

406
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,784
Out of the way. Move!

407
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,202
Don't make me cut you.

408
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,672
Oh, God.

409
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,675
Hey, yeah.

410
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:26,935
You think I'm gonna let you have
all the fun for yourself?

411
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,649
Just remember,

412
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,526
patience and focus.

413
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:36,904
Okay.

414
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,117
Come on. Let's go.

415
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,745
We gotta find the princess.

416
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,538
Come on.

417
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,958
- Yeah!
- Come on.

418
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,336
Yes.

419
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,504
Let's take that off.

420
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,715
- You wanna come with me tonight?
- Psst.

421
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,050
Ooh, tasty.

422
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,011
- Get that off!
- No!

423
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:03,847
- Come on, come on!
- Come here, love.

424
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,392
Oh, yeah. Do you like my hand there?

425
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,726
She loves it.

426
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,897
- Don't touch me. No!
- Yes.

427
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,233
Don't touch me!

428
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,653
Hey, we ain't gonna hurt you… much.

429
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,783
- Now, now.
- Yeah.

430
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,329
- Oi! Where's my supper?
- Keep your voice down.

431
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,580
What's happened to the cook?

432
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,082
- Yes.
- Who are you?

433
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,334
I'm the princess.

434
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:38,799
And that's Linh.

435
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,429
Nice to meet you.

436
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,640
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

437
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,225
Thank you.

438
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,856
It's her.

439
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,775
Sweet little princess.

440
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,831
Here, you hungry, love?

441
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,903
Well, go on, then!

442
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,829
Come on.

443
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,488
All you had to do was accept a ring.

444
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,366
Instead, you made a mess.

445
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,119
Why go through all this trouble?

446
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,498
Be the weak little person
you were meant to be.

447
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,461
Let's find out.

448
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,325
Linh.

449
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,004
Princess!

450
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,856
Princess, you go. I'm gonna stop her.

451
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,631
- I'm not leaving without you.
- Your family needs you.

452
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,633
You have to leave now
before it's too late.

453
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,843
- Linh, no.
- Princess, trust me.

454
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:10,927
Go now. Go!

455
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,538
- All right. You ready, boys?
- Oh, yeah.

456
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,124
My last coin.

457
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:25,627
I spent my money at the tower.

458
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,089
Yeah, you wanna get down to the brothel.
They let you drink for free.

459
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,426
Oh, yeah? I wonder why that is.

460
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,471
No drink, no win.

461
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,348
Right, hit me.

462
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,308
Go on, then. Hurry up.

463
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,855
What...

464
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:13,675
I needed that.

465
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,095
Enough.

466
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:22,893
Come on!

467
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:56,927
I knew it.

468
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,179
Well, then.

469
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,681
Shall we?

470
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,478
Violet.

471
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,064
We have to go. Okay.

472
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:10,899
Stay close.

473
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,984
Stay close to me.

474
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:19,783
Come on, come.

475
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,504
Look at the mess you've made.

476
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,967
Not exactly the ladylike behavior
I'd expect of you.

477
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,554
But that will change.

478
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,063
- Leave my sister alone!
- Violet, no.

479
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,067
Have we not talked about your manners?

480
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,404
You're an oddity.

481
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:43,074
What on earth happened
to make you end up this way?

482
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,576
I was born this way.

483
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,953
No, you were born to be my wife.

484
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,374
I look forward to it.

485
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,421
Oh, you do?

486
01:01:57,964 --> 01:01:59,174
At your side.

487
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:01,468
Every day.

488
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,556
At your service every night.

489
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,144
It's like something out of a fairy tale…

490
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,563
For me.

491
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:16,650
And for me?

492
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,989
A nightmare.

493
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:29,788
You'll learn to sleep with one eye open.

494
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,708
To never turn your back.

495
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,086
I'll be in heaven,

496
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:40,590
just thinking day and night

497
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,217
of ways to kill you.

498
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,053
And you'll be in hell…

499
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:50,100
Wondering when it's coming.

500
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,145
And you know that it will be coming.

501
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,943
Because you know that I'll never rest,

502
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,239
never idle, never stop,

503
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:09,035
until I am standing above your corpse,

504
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:14,958
holding, in my delicate, manicured hands,

505
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,045
your still-beating heart.

506
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,518
Well, it seems the princess
is still unwilling.

507
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,151
If only there were another option.

508
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,119
No.

509
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,710
You look as though you won't be
nearly as much trouble as your sister.

510
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,588
Julius, you wouldn't.

511
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,756
Wouldn't I?

512
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:10,638
Kill the princess.

513
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:11,598
No!

514
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,141
- No, stop!
- Julius, please!

515
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,982
Get back here!

516
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:30,366
No!

517
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,477
And always remember, Princess,

518
01:04:58,061 --> 01:05:00,188
the real power is not from your blade,

519
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,482
but from your heart.

520
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:04,359
What is this?

521
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,319
I am strong. I can fight.

522
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:07,529
You're my child.

523
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:09,489
I never wish to see you this way again.

524
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:13,034
- When I slit the king's throat.
- I have to save them, Linh.

525
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,745
- Julius, you wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?

526
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:33,680
A true warrior is defined
not by how she fights,

527
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,016
but by what she is fighting for.

528
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,970
- Come on, boys.
- Come on.

529
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,974
You. There.

530
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,976
Stand in the middle as before.

531
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:22,729
Bring in the rest of our guests.

532
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,482
And where is Violet? Find her now.

533
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:28,693
Find the girl!

534
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,278
Come on, move!

535
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:33,281
- You, that way. In there.
- Quickly!

536
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,926
Oi! Get up.

537
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:55,470
Come with me. Get up.

538
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:19,744
Did I help?

539
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,623
- Good job.
- Oh, yes!

540
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,918
Oh, thank you, Violet. Yeah.

541
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:31,339
Princess. You survived.

542
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:39,639
It seems so childish now.

543
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,434
Me telling you
that I wanted to be a warrior.

544
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,189
If I had just done my duty...

545
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:50,191
No, Princess. No.

546
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,861
Julius would be the same monster
no matter what you did.

547
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,702
You have to stop him.

548
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,670
Come with us. Come on.

549
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,631
Linh, you go first.

550
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:23,683
This is one of our storehouses,
in the event of a siege.

551
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:53,296
- Let's get you ready.
- Yes.

552
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:56,382
- Look everywhere. Come on!
- Come on! Find that child!

553
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,010
Quickly! Find the child!

554
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:12,023
Little Violet can't hide forever.
We will find her.

555
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,360
Check in there! Get a move on!

556
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,196
What do you think?

557
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,200
I want to fight too.

558
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:08,496
You know,

559
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:14,168
I once knew a princess that said
the exact same thing at your age.

560
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,629
But you got to do it.

561
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:22,885
And you will too.
I will see to it myself, I promise.

562
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:25,430
But until then…

563
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,308
Hidden. Quiet. Alive.

564
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,352
Yes. That's my girl.

565
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,231
I love you.

566
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,237
Stay safe.

567
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:01,215
Well, now we're all here.

568
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:04,886
Call for Violet.

569
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,013
She'll come to you.

570
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,641
I'll cut out my tongue first.

571
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:14,645
Yes, it may come to that.

572
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,364
Come on!

573
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:48,262
She refuses death, time and time again.

574
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,808
Not for much longer.

575
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,822
- Come on. Move!
- Come on! Let's go!

576
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,522
Go on!

577
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,192
Hyah!

578
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,869
We've got to find a way in!

579
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,349
Stay where you are!

580
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,937
Keep them under control outside.

581
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:23,065
And make sure it is done properly
this time, you understand?

582
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,692
Yes, milord. Come on.

583
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,964
Aim at the joints. Trust me.

584
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:04,941
Gotcha!

585
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,158
Come here!

586
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,494
- Get up.
- Violet!

587
01:14:18,496 --> 01:14:20,665
- Julius!
- Your eldest daughter…

588
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:24,460
- I'll kill you. Get away from me!
- …Is about to become a corpse.

589
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,922
And as for the little one…

590
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,090
Kneel.

591
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,926
Marry us.

592
01:14:32,677 --> 01:14:35,388
We have to get in there. Let's split up.

593
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:41,936
Come on then!

594
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,375
Go on.

595
01:15:37,575 --> 01:15:38,617
Take her!

596
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,135
Now!

597
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,071
I underestimated you.

598
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,990
That's okay. I'm used to that.

599
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,423
Linh.

600
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,625
No, don't!

601
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:12,920
Julius, please!

602
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:16,924
Go! Move, move, move!

603
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,470
- Come.
- Linh!

604
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:28,310
That sword doesn't belong to you.

605
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:40,841
Linh!

606
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,186
Linh!

607
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,480
No! No!

608
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:00,194
No!

609
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,282
No.

610
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,961
Get to safety.

611
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:07,011
It looks like you got me
to the altar after all.

612
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:08,804
Yes.

613
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,432
I told you I would,

614
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:13,684
didn't I?

615
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:23,527
Hyah!

616
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,793
Your parents wept the day you were born.

617
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:41,462
I was there.

618
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,549
They were so upset that you weren't a man.

619
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:48,886
Well, I heard…

620
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,598
Yours wept for the same reason.

621
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:01,815
Yeah.

622
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,047
I was going to make
your little sister's life

623
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,342
much, much easier…

624
01:21:30,844 --> 01:21:33,680
Until you started behaving like this.

625
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,213
Here she is.

626
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:09,758
Your pretty princess.

627
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:15,556
Kneeling before the new king.

628
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:21,186
A reminder to you all
that I won't be belittled.

629
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,397
I won't be forsaken

630
01:22:24,565 --> 01:22:26,817
in this weak and feeble kingdom.

631
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,654
That power is required on the throne.

632
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:39,997
I will be that power.

633
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:44,710
I will rule with aggression
like no one else before!

634
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,714
Patience…

635
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:53,594
A reminder to you people.

636
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,390
I will never, ever…

637
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:03,270
…have taken from me
what is rightfully mine.

638
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,231
…and focus.

639
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,734
It was never yours.

640
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:26,603
The kingdom is ours again.

641
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:46,873
Ring the chapel bells until midnight

642
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,293
because today,

643
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,421
an heir to the kingdom was born.

644
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:24,995
Henceforth,

645
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:28,498
the daughters of this kingdom
make their own fate,

646
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,585
just as my daughter has done today.

647
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:37,341
I have never been more proud.

648
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,637
We are, all of us, in your debt.

649
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,722
I was wrong.

650
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:45,641
I should have trusted you.

651
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:49,770
Forgive me.

652
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:57,110
Now, rise.

653
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:05,577
And let the people see
their future leader for who she is.

654
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,103
Linh?

655
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,396
- Linh.
- Princess.

656
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:34,189
You're alive.

657
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:36,191
You're alive.

658
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:46,868
Princess.

659
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,044
You did it.

660
01:26:56,962 --> 01:26:58,213
You did it.

661
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:25,782
There she is!

661
01:27:26,305 --> 01:28:26,917
