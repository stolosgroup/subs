3
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:04,015
Ree?

4
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:06,916
Ree?

5
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,186
Wake up, baby.

6
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,693
They wanna hear you sing.

7
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,297
You wanna sing?

8
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:22,066
Yes, please.

9
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,168
All right.

10
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,182
Clarence,
Ella's looking for you.

11
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,451
Wait here, Ree.

12
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:42,486
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

13
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:43,753
They butchered
my essay.

14
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,156
Took all the politics out.

15
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,756
Can you believe that?

16
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:48,792
Communism is absolutely
for the Negro.

17
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,494
How else are we gonna have
everything we ever wanted?

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,795
Now, how does
a man with one eye

19
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,464
play like he has four hands?

20
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:54,798
You been practicing?

21
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,666
Yes, Mr. Tatum.

22
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:58,502
She could hit
three octaves easy.

23
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:00,870
You know, you the finest
looking cat here, right?

24
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,739
Nigga, I know that.

25
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,241
What else you got?

26
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,214
Hey, Ree.

27
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:11,748
Hey, Uncle Sam.

28
00:02:11,815 --> 00:02:13,551
No more segregated
clubs for me.

29
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:15,219
I'm not walking through
no one's kitchen

30
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:17,421
to get to the stage.

31
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:20,524
I said to them,
"I'm so happy to be performing in England,

32
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,992
but just remember

33
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,427
there's only one Heaven,
one Earth,

34
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:25,229
and one queen.

35
00:02:25,296 --> 00:02:27,298
Me. Dinah Washington."

36
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,900
"That Elizabeth on y'alls
throne is an imposter."

37
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:32,936
- You didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

38
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,539
And I made 'em bow before me.

39
00:02:35,605 --> 00:02:37,841
Well, look out, y'all.

40
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:40,111
The entertainer is here.

41
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,146
Hi.

42
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:43,780
He said he wanted
a race novel.

43
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,983
Sure, he desegregated
the army.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,717
But he didn't do
a damn thing after that.

45
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:50,054
- Hi, Aunt Ella. Uncle Duke.
- Hey.

46
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,022
You ready, Ree?
Come on.

47
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,564
Excuse me?
Everyone.

48
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,832
Everyone.

49
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,303
For those of you visiting
my home for the first time,

50
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:10,740
this is my daughter, Aretha.

51
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:13,277
She'd like to sing
a little something for you.

52
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:14,878
What would you
like to sing, Ree?

53
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,315
How old is she?

54
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:19,883
She's 10,

55
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,119
but her voice's
going on 30, honey.

56
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:24,754
Aretha would
like to perform

57
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,057

want to sing, don't.

00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,147
Not crying!

166
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:59,082
- Not complaining!
- No!

167
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:00,517
Praising the Lord!

168
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,021
- Yeah!
- 'Cause he knew

169
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:04,821
the Lord was with him.

170
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,591
He feared no man!

171
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,226
Can you hear me, church?

172
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:10,962
I wish somebody
would pray with me

173
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,964
- 'cause He will!
- He will!

174
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:14,565
- He will!
- He will!

175
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:17,768
He will shut the jaws
of segregation,

176
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,403
and any man, person,

177
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,872
or institution that would dare

178
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:23,840
stand against us.

179
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:26,543
He took us from slavery,

180
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,913
he took us from
the valley of reconstruction.

181
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:31,915
Freedom!

182
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:33,784
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

183
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,185
Freedom!

184
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:36,753
- Freedom!
- Freedom!

185
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,156
Freedom now!
Praise Him! Praise Him!

186
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,192
- Preach, Daddy, preach!
- Hallelujah.

187
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:52,936
Hey? Ree?

188
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:55,006
Ree!

189
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:57,140
How come
you're not singing tonight?

190
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,743
Daddy didn't ask me to.

192

Dee.

193
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,887
Mmm. That's a pretty name.

194
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,225
You're pretty, too.

195

What's your boyfriend's name?

196
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:19,363
I don't have
a boyfriend.

197
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,033
I can be your boyfriend.

198

Would you like that?

I wonder,
do you feel all right?

339
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:22,259
Yes!

340
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:23,627
I said,
do you feel all right?

341
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:24,927
Yes!

342
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:27,431
Amen.

343
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:31,635
I'm ecstatic to be able
to report to you

344
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:35,372
that the day before yesterday,
we filled up the jail.

345
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,510
We have already won a victory
here in Birmingham.

346
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:40,810
Amen!

347
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,714
Due, in no small part,

348
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:46,283
to the valiant work
of our leader.

349
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,386
A man whom I feel
honored to call my friend.

350
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:55,059
The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

351
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,828
All right! Yes, sir!
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

352
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:05,969
Come on! Somebody!

353
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:16,080
Some people

354
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:19,083
think that we are crazy

355
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,085
for taking on this fight.

356
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,820
Yes!

357
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:26,023
But the forces against us
are strong,

358
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,159
and they are determined
to stop us.

359
00:23:29,226 --> 00:23:33,497
But we are just
as determined to go on!

360
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,369
Non-violently,

361
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:41,338
with love.

362
00:23:41,405 --> 00:23:44,641
As long as it takes
to win our freedom.

363
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:46,009
Yes!

364
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,280
And Jesus is here with us
every single step of the way.

365
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:53,650
Amen!

366
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:54,651
Yes, sir!

367
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,955
Uncle Martin...

368
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:01,325
Now don't call me
Uncle Martin anymore.

369
00:24:01,392 --> 00:24:02,826
You make me feel old,
that's the problem.

370
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,294
I want to march.

371
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:06,797
Don't look at me
like I'm still a child.

372
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,031
I'm not afraid.

373
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:09,666
- Oh, you're not?
- No.

374
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,335
Well, damn.

375
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:13,103
Then you need to be
leadin' this movement

376
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,205
and teaching me how to not be

377
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:17,374
terrified of these
crazy white folks.

378
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:19,909
Martin...

379
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:22,346
Why do you want to march?

380
00:24:22,413 --> 00:24:25,215
After all this time
traveling with you,

381
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:26,850
after all the horror
we've seen,

382
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,419
what kind of question is that?

383
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,357
Are you runnin'
from your daddy?

384
00:24:33,424 --> 00:24:34,491
No.

385
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:39,863
So, you tell him
you wanna march?

386
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:41,532
I don't have to.

387
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:43,967
It's my decision.
I'm a grown woman, remember?

388
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:48,839
Oh, so, you ready
to orphan your kids now, hmm?

389
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:51,041
- Are you?
- No.

390
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:52,176
But you're doing it anyway.

391
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,378
Because I have to.

392
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:56,146
- And I don't?
- Ree...

393
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,148
Singing for the movement

394
00:24:58,215 --> 00:25:00,851
and sending people
into battle with a song

395
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,986
is not enough anymore.

396
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:04,388
I need to be with them.

397
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:06,457
You have a good talk?

398
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,126
Yes.

399
00:25:14,731 --> 00:25:16,467
It was a good talk.

400
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:19,069
Brother, come on.

401
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:21,205
She's restless, I can tell.

402
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:23,607
I... I... I don't know
if it's restless.

403
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:27,010
She just wants to do more.

404
00:25:27,077 --> 00:25:28,512
What kind of more?

405
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:40,524
I'll be there in a minute.

406
00:25:43,827 --> 00:25:45,028
Momma!

407
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:47,698
Clarence! Eddie!

408
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:51,101
- Momma! Momma! Momma!
- My babies! My babies!

409
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:55,038
Are you all right, baby?

410
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:57,908
Clarence, you go in your room
and wait for me.

411
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,943
Come here. It's all right,
baby, it's all right.

412
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,445
Come on. Come on.

413
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,380
It's all right.
It's all right.

414
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:06,049
Every time I come
back, they want me less.

415
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:07,584
That's not true.

416
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,720
They talk about you
all the time.

417
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:12,523
Every night, I show 'em
where you are on the map.

418
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,558
One cookie.

419
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:20,430
Fix your face now.

420
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:22,933
This party is for y'all.

421
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,134
- How are you, Mama?
- God is good.

422
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:25,536
All the time.

423
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:26,803
Amen.

424
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,672
Let's eat. I'm starving.

425
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:34,444
So, where y'all headed?

426
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,347
We go to Tennessee,
then to Georgia,

427
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:40,484
then to North Carolina,
and then back to Alabama, I think.

428
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,819
Damn. Martin's tour's busier
than Daddy's.

429
00:26:42,886 --> 00:26:46,623
Erma, sometimes we hit
two states in one day.

430
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,527
What was that story about
Aunt Mahalia not paying you?

431
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:54,097
She said I would receive
my reward in Heaven.

432
00:26:58,635 --> 00:26:59,770
Oh.

433
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,574
No, Ree. Uh-uh.

434
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:15,452
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

435
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:17,087
- Smokey...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

436
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,522
He's got some news, Ree.

437
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:20,290
I heard
you're cuttin' a record.

438
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,292
Yeah, with Berry
over at Motown.

439
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,328
They got some
sweet sounds, Ree.

440
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,296
They're signing a bunch of
folks in the neighborhood.

441
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,131
Listen, we are trying
to put Detroit on the map.

442
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,533
You gotta be a part of it.

443
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,668
- I would love that.
- Yeah?

444
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,337
Cecil, let me talk
to Daddy about it.

445
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,205
Don't bring it up until I say.

446
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:37,008
You know what?
Let's let Berry talk to him.

447
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:38,542
Better yet, his sister.

448
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:40,877
She can talk ice
out of the devil's mouth.

449
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,747
What are you drinking?

450
00:27:44,548 --> 00:27:45,882
Iced tea.

451
00:27:47,351 --> 00:27:50,687
Just iced tea?

452
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:55,626
With a little bourbon.

453
00:27:56,793 --> 00:27:59,396
Yeah, you look
like a bourbon girl.

454
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:03,034
How long are you in town for?

455
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,334
A week.

456
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:06,104
Then I return to Tennessee.

457
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,771
Well, then,
I won't waste any time.

458
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:09,272
Mm.

459
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,908
- I'd like to take you out.
- Hmm.

460
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:13,777
I'd like you to take me out.

461
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:15,712
How about tonight?

462
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:18,348
Ree!

463
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,317
Come and help me
set this table.

464
00:28:22,053 --> 00:28:25,056
Yes, to tonight.

465
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:27,658
- Okay.
- Excuse me a moment.

466
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:39,403
Reverend.

467
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:42,205
I put up with you coming
to my house all these years

468
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:44,608
'cause you were friends
with my friends.

469
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:46,610
But I don't want you
around here anymore.

470
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:48,812
May I give you some counsel,
Reverend?

471
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,382
Ephesians 6:4 says, "Fathers,

472
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:54,618
do not exasperate
your children.

473
00:28:54,685 --> 00:28:56,420
Instead, bring them up
in the training

474
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,522
and the instruction
of the Lord."

475
00:28:58,588 --> 00:29:00,257
Lord, give me strength.

476
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,892
Are you serious?

477
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,628
You may wanna loosen
your grip on Aretha.

478
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:06,363
You know, every minister's
daughter I've ever known...

479
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,831
Nigga, you don't
wanna mess with me...

480
00:29:08,765 --> 00:29:09,833
or mine.

481
00:29:31,055 --> 00:29:32,723
I got this.

482
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:34,858
I got it.

483
00:29:42,933 --> 00:29:44,768

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,604

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,954
Everyone! everyone!

491
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,889
Please, please, gather around.

492
00:30:07,924 --> 00:30:10,027
Aretha, will you join me,
please?

493
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:18,035
This party is not just, uh,

494
00:30:18,102 --> 00:30:19,503
a homecoming.

495
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,606
It's also an announcement.

496
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:26,843
God is moving us
on to our next chapter.

497
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:31,848
I've been talking to a number
of record producers

498
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,184
about Aretha.

499
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,885
There were many

500
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,787
who were interested
in working with her.

501
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,925
Tell them what it is, Ree.

502
00:30:41,993 --> 00:30:42,926
Ah...

503
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:46,830
A plane ticket
to New York City.

504
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:53,937
Congratulations, Ree.

505
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:57,841
Thank you.

506
00:30:57,908 --> 00:30:59,509
<i>♪ Think, think ♪</i>

507
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:01,511
<i>♪ About the good things ♪</i>

508
00:31:01,578 --> 00:31:03,080
This is it.

509
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,083
Wow.

510
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:09,753
Excuse me?

511
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,956
I have a meeting
with a John Hammond

512
00:31:12,023 --> 00:31:13,157
of Columbia Records.

513
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:14,959
Sign in, please.

514
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,334
You ready?

515
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,470
I'm ready.

516
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,182
I've always seen Aretha
as more than a gospel singer.

517
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:41,451
Well, clearly from her demo,
she's so much more.

518
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:44,855
Stand up, Ree.

519
00:31:46,057 --> 00:31:47,992
Turn around.

520
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:52,263
There can sometimes be
a lack of effortlessness

521
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,897
of the kind you find

522
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:57,467
in a Lena Horne
or a Dorothy Dandridge.

523
00:31:57,534 --> 00:32:00,804
But what Aretha lacks
in formal education,

524
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:03,740
she more than makes up for
in experience.

525
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:07,944
She has performed before every
type of crowd imaginable,

526
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:11,882
from small churches
to audiences of thousands.

527
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:13,917
You can sit down now, Ree.

528
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:24,561
I... I'm curious.

529
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:28,899
Who are your favorite artists?

530
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:30,567
Dinah Washington.

531
00:32:31,202 --> 00:32:32,535
Ella Fitzgerald.

532
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,171
- Hmm.
- Sam Cooke.

533
00:32:35,206 --> 00:32:37,041
All family friends.

534
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:39,110
Sam would very much
like Aretha

535
00:32:39,176 --> 00:32:41,045
to sign with RCA.

536
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:43,914
Well, we can't have that.

537
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:47,717
Welcome

538
00:32:47,784 --> 00:32:49,519
to Columbia Records.

539
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,525
Oh.

540
00:32:57,995 --> 00:32:59,596
<i>Prove yourself</i>

541
00:33:01,198 --> 00:33:02,732

542
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,235
<i>I understand.</i>

543
00:33:04,302 --> 00:33:05,802
Wonderful.

544
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,614
<i>Are you ready, Aretha?</i>

545
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,749
- Yes, Mr. Hammond.
- <i>Wonderful.</i>

546
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:21,551
<i>The conductor
will point at you</i>

547
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:23,020
<i>when he's ready

548
00:33:36,233 --> 00:33:40,770

552
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:50,914
She sounds wonderful,
doesn't she?

553
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:52,183
She does.

554
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:54,418
Like a black Judy Garland.

555
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:56,720

Unforgettable.

563
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:24,315
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

564
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:27,018
We hope you enjoy
the show tonight.

565
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:29,753
I see an old family friend.

566
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,289
Dinah Washington
is in the audience.

567
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:41,265
I'd like to sing a song

568
00:34:41,332 --> 00:34:45,069
in honor of her great artistry
and talent.

569
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:04,721
<i>♪ This bitter ♪</i>

570
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:06,856
<i>♪ Bitter... ♪</i>

571
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:09,994
Bitch!

572
00:35:10,061 --> 00:35:11,828
Don't you ever sing
the Queen's songs

573
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:13,130
when the Queen
is in front of you!

574
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:24,941
What the hell
were you thinking?

575
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:26,743
I'm sorry.

576
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,212
You wanna take me on?

577
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,114
- No.
- Liar.

578
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,881
You wouldn't be here if you
wasn't trying to replace me

579
00:35:31,948 --> 00:35:33,217
and every other bitch
out here singin'.

580
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:36,287
How many albums have you had?

581
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:37,288
Four.

582
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:40,224
And no hits.

583
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,934
You out here,
but I can see you

584
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,702
still that little girl
in your daddy's living room.

585
00:35:52,769 --> 00:35:55,039
You're singin' everything
and anything.

586
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,575
<i>Shoop Shoop</i> one day,
<i>Skylark</i> the next,

587
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,909
and then some
Billie Holiday blues.

588
00:35:59,977 --> 00:36:01,744
Girl, you're all
over the place.

589
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:04,315
What do you wanna sing?

590
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,715
I don't know.

591
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,919
You don't know?

592
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:12,990
I want hits. I just want hits.

593
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:14,924
Girl, you need to let go
of that "up with the race"

594
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:17,595
Booker T. Washington
proper Negro shit.

595
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,263
That's not you.

596
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,897
Your daddy likes to pretend
that's who he is,

597
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,799
but that's not
who he is either.

598
00:36:22,866 --> 00:36:25,202
Child, y'all church folks

599
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:28,139
are some of the nastiest
people out here.

600
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:30,508
Ray Charles told me
that the best sex he ever had

601
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:32,642
was when he was singin'
on the gospel circuit.

602
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:37,947
Honey, find the songs
that suit you. That move you.

603
00:36:38,015 --> 00:36:41,418
Until you do that,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

604
00:36:45,356 --> 00:36:46,957
Put some teabags on that.

605
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:49,293
Take the puffiness down.

606
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:55,966
How's Big Mama?

607
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,036
She's all right.

608
00:36:59,637 --> 00:37:00,770
The kids?

609
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,507
They're good.

610
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:05,909
Child, you ever gonna tell us
who their daddy is?

611
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:38,875
Ree-Ree?

612
00:37:38,942 --> 00:37:40,277
You wanna tell me
what's wrong?

613
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,345
I can't.

614
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,178
No answer.

615
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,946
Call her again.

616
00:38:17,014 --> 00:38:19,749
Oh, there we go.

617
00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:22,319
Hmm.

618
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,522
I didn't know you were
comin' in today, Daddy.

619
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:27,024
You are 68 minutes late.

620
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:30,194
Mr. Hammond
asked me to come in.

621
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:34,331
You've been skipping
interviews and gigs.

622
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,800
The demon is back.

623
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:41,071
Ree has a tendency
to indulge her pain.

624
00:38:41,138 --> 00:38:43,474
Can we talk about this
somewhere else?

625
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,342
John. John.

626
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:48,545
It's important that you
understand that this behavior

627
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:53,250
is not a reflection
of her upbringing or her race.

628
00:38:53,317 --> 00:38:54,951
Well, I've worked
with Bessie Smith

629
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:56,587
and Billie Holiday.

630
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:58,355
Aretha is a saint
in comparison.

631
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,691
She wasn't raised in
a whorehouse like them.

632
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:02,993
She was raised
in a proper home

633
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,362
with every convenience
and luxury.

634
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:10,968
But still, a darkness
would descend on her.

635
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:12,835
I called it the demon.

636
00:39:12,902 --> 00:39:16,073
She'd lock herself away,
wouldn't speak, move,

637
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,242
just wallow
in whatever imaginary...

638
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:19,977
I...

639
00:39:22,346 --> 00:39:24,914
You told me before
we came out here

640
00:39:24,982 --> 00:39:26,016
that you had it under control.

641
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,451
I have control.

642
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:32,389
You keep complaining
that you don't have any hits.

643
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:35,125
This is why
you don't have any hits.

644
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:36,460
Acting like a trifling...

645
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:41,398
Apologize to Mr. Hammond.

646
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:43,267
No, there's no need
to apologize.

647
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:46,036
That is not why
I don't have hits.

648
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:47,471
You don't pick
good songs for me.

649
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:58,015
Sorry for being late,
Mr. Hammond.

650
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:02,019
It won't happen again.

651
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,489
I'm ready to record
when you are.

652
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,424
Hmm.

653
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:13,863
Please excuse me while
I go to the ladies' room.

654
00:40:29,246 --> 00:40:31,782
So, you gonna come
with us this weekend?

655
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:32,983
I have a gig.

656
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,884
We can go after your gig.

657
00:40:35,652 --> 00:40:37,254
You work too hard.

658
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,656
Not according to my daddy.

659
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,925
Well, you need some fun.

660
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:44,395
Come with us.

661
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:54,538
Can you introduce me
to his friend?

662
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:56,473
I don't know him.

663
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:38,916
You were supposed
to take me out in Detroit.

664
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:40,451
Yes, one of my singers

665
00:41:40,517 --> 00:41:41,985
ran into a little trouble
out of town,

666
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:44,388
so I had to take care of it.

667
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:46,390
I think my father
said something to you

668
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,826
- to make you reconsider.
- Oh.

669
00:41:48,892 --> 00:41:52,663
That's a nice little fable
you got goin' on in your head.

670
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:55,532
I know what you do.

671
00:41:57,968 --> 00:41:59,670
It doesn't bother me.

672
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:04,341
I know it doesn't bother you.

673
00:42:04,408 --> 00:42:07,478
You're rebelling against
your daddy.

674
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:08,679
I don't mind.

675
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,616
Listen, you wanna
use me for my body,

676
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:15,052
you can use me, baby.

677
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,421
You can wring me dry.

678
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:20,491
You and me,
we've been through it.

679
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:23,494
So we can skip all the flowers

680
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,362
and the promises,
and the love bullshit,

681
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:27,397
and just have some fun.

682
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:29,032
I like fun.

683
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,634
And we'll have plenty of it.

684
00:42:34,738 --> 00:42:36,440
I want one thing from you.

685
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:38,642
What?

686
00:42:39,776 --> 00:42:41,411
To hear you sing.

687
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:43,046
Just for me.

688
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:45,449
What will I get in return?

689
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:48,652
The best night of your life.

690
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:19,349
Taxi!

691
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:39,169
I want you to think about me
when you sing tomorrow.

692
00:43:39,236 --> 00:43:41,338
You're not coming home
with me?

693
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,473
No.

694
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,442
What about the best night
of my life?

695
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:47,578
I didn't say
it would be tonight.

No.

708

You have all my records.

728
00:46:25,268 --> 00:46:26,803
You like them?

729
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,871
I bought them.

730
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:31,808
Which one you like best?

731
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:34,811
They've all got something.

732
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:38,248
Is this one your favorite?

733
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,618
Hmm?

734
00:46:44,956 --> 00:46:46,356
Or this?

735
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:50,660
What are you doing?

736
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,063
Or this one?

737
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,531
Went to 64 on the charts.

738
00:46:56,366 --> 00:46:58,435
You didn't even open this one.

739
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:01,805
You don't like them?

740
00:47:02,606 --> 00:47:03,840
I didn't say that.

741
00:47:03,907 --> 00:47:05,176
Then say it.

742
00:47:05,243 --> 00:47:06,843
I won't be upset.

743
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:09,312
No one does.

744
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:12,282
First, I've listened
to all your albums.

745
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,585
Including this one.

746
00:47:16,353 --> 00:47:17,854
More than once.

747
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:22,325
Secondly, I love music.

748
00:47:22,392 --> 00:47:24,661
I take it seriously.

749
00:47:24,728 --> 00:47:27,497
I managed my first artist
when I was 15.

750
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:31,235
Thirdly, what you
experienced yesterday,

751
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:33,770
17 takes on one song?

752
00:47:33,837 --> 00:47:36,740
That happens to me
every time I hear you sing.

753
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:39,843
My brain gets all...

754
00:47:41,012 --> 00:47:42,813
muddled.

755
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:46,883
Well, first,

756
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,955
my apologies for putting
you through so much pain.

757
00:47:53,323 --> 00:47:56,160
- And secondly...
- Mm-hmm.

758
00:47:56,227 --> 00:47:59,596
...you should have never told
me about your Achilles' heel.

759
00:48:00,564 --> 00:48:02,599
On our first date.

760
00:48:04,168 --> 00:48:05,970
<i>♪ Jazz ♪</i>

761
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,510
Oh, damn it.

762
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:24,222
Keep singing.

763
00:48:24,288 --> 00:48:25,957
I didn't think you were
comin' home for two weeks.

764
00:48:26,023 --> 00:48:27,858
I miss my babies.

765
00:48:27,924 --> 00:48:29,392
And y'all.

766
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:32,629
Who's that plate for?

767
00:48:33,697 --> 00:48:34,798
Ted.

768
00:48:34,865 --> 00:48:37,969
Oh, sweet Jesus,
are you serious?

769
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:39,469
- What are you thinking?
- Please help me with Daddy.

770
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:40,737
- No...
- Help me.

771
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:42,772
Good Sunday, everybody.

772
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:50,947
What the hell is this?

773
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:52,816
You didn't tell them
I was coming?

774
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:54,185
I don't know what you think
you're doing here

775
00:48:54,252 --> 00:48:55,286
and I don't care.

776
00:48:55,353 --> 00:48:57,454
Just leave. Now.

777
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,922
Aretha asked me to come

778
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:00,891
and Aretha
can ask me to leave.

779
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:04,461
- I want him to stay.
- This is my house.

780
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:05,997
Since when do
you get to tell me

781
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:07,697
who gets to be in my house,
Ree, huh?

782
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:09,699
I want you to get to know him.

783
00:49:09,766 --> 00:49:11,135
He's not what you think.

784
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:12,103
Are you pregnant again?

785
00:49:12,169 --> 00:49:13,637
No!

786
00:49:14,571 --> 00:49:16,806
We just wanna be together.

787
00:49:18,276 --> 00:49:19,977
I love your daughter,
Reverend.

788
00:49:22,113 --> 00:49:24,215
And I think she loves me.

789
00:49:24,282 --> 00:49:25,749
I do.

790
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:27,651
- No! No!
- Oh, my Lord!

791
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,619
- Ree...
- Clarence! No!

792
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:31,289
Didn't I tell you
not to mess with me or mine?

793
00:49:31,355 --> 00:49:32,589
- Didn't I tell you?
- Clarence!

794
00:49:32,656 --> 00:49:34,457
Son, don't you let this man

795
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:35,659
put your church
and your soul in jeopardy.

796
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:47,204
Reverend,

797
00:49:48,538 --> 00:49:49,739
we have to figure this out.

798
00:49:49,806 --> 00:49:51,808
I'm not going anywhere.

799
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:54,145
You can't see
through this hustler?

800
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:56,947
You're the greatest hustler I ever seen.

801
00:49:57,014 --> 00:49:59,883
Every night, she picks herself
apart because of you.

802
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:03,054
She thinks it's her hair,
her body, her voice.

803
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,356
She worries about failing you,
but it's your failure.

804
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:07,258
Get out! Just...

805
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:09,626
Daddy, I know
how busy you are.

806
00:50:09,693 --> 00:50:11,828
You have so much
going on all the time.

807
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:13,965
Running a church,
the speakin' engagements,

808
00:50:14,031 --> 00:50:16,633
managing Carolyn.

809
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,036
I know about your contract
at Horizon Records.

810
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:20,670
I was gonna tell you.

811
00:50:20,737 --> 00:50:22,739
When?
When the damn album came out?

812
00:50:22,806 --> 00:50:24,408
Nobody can tell you anything,
Ree. You're so jealous.

813
00:50:24,474 --> 00:50:25,909
Jealous? Of you two?

814
00:50:25,977 --> 00:50:27,378
You think you better than us?

815
00:50:27,445 --> 00:50:28,912
That's exactly

816
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,281
- what she's saying.
- No!

817
00:50:30,348 --> 00:50:31,983
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

818
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,552
You are not

819

820
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:41,725
I need a change.

821
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:44,794
I wanna sing what I wanna sing

822
00:50:44,861 --> 00:50:47,931
and I wanna dress
like I want to dress.

823
00:50:48,898 --> 00:50:50,034
And I want Ted to manage me.

824
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:54,138
He's not worth the shit
at the bottom of my shoe.

825
00:50:54,205 --> 00:50:56,539
So that means that you think
I'm worth less than that.

826
00:50:56,606 --> 00:50:58,075
After all we've been through.

827
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,609

828

I have to do this, Daddy.

829
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:16,027
You are going to beg me
to take you back.

I won't.

832
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:45,855
I'm gonna say goodbye
to my children.

833
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:48,225
- Okay.
- And then we'll go.

834
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,260
Okay.

Your version of <i>Skylark</i>

850
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:14,545
Thank you, Mr. Wexler.

00:53:14,612 --> 00:53:16,313
Oh, please, call me Jerry.

852
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:18,149
You know what Etta James said
when she heard it?

853
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:20,151
She said you pissed
all over that song,

854
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:22,685
and she would never sing it
again in her entire life.

855
00:53:22,752 --> 00:53:24,687
You ruined that song
for Etta James.

856
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:26,223
That is how good it was.

857
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,824
And I'm not
bullshittin' ya, okay?

858
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:29,627
A lot of these guys out here

859
00:53:29,692 --> 00:53:30,760
will say anything
to get in your drawers,

860
00:53:30,827 --> 00:53:32,263
but that's not me.

861
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:34,265
I'm sorry.
All right, I'm crude.

862
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:36,567
And you're a church girl,
and I should watch my mouth.

863
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:38,068
I'm sorry.

864
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,205
You do talk, don't ya?
Not just sing?

865
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,775
You are
the sweetest thing, Aretha.

866
00:53:47,044 --> 00:53:48,745
I'd like you to call me
Miss Franklin.

867
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:51,848
Okay, Miss Franklin.

868
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:53,617
What songs would
you like to sing?

869
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:55,252
I want hits.

870
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,154
We're done
with standards.

871
00:53:57,221 --> 00:53:59,123
We want original songs
made for Aretha only.

872
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,858
Great! We are speaking
the same language, my man.

873
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:03,394
One of the songwriters
I represent

874
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,727
wrote a good song for Aretha,

875
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:06,530
<i>I Never Loved A Man.</i>

876
00:54:06,597 --> 00:54:08,666
Terrific. I've got the perfect
place to record it.

877
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:10,034
I'm working with
this little studio

878
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,768
down in Alabama and...

879
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:13,703
Aretha's only recorded
in New York.

880
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:15,838
Yeah, I know that, but I think
that's part of the problem.

881
00:54:15,905 --> 00:54:17,575
It's overproduced,
it's a little too polished.

882
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:18,576
I mean, these boys
down there...

883
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:20,411
"Boys"?

884
00:54:20,477 --> 00:54:22,112
Don't be offended, all right?

885
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:24,181
I say boys because
they're young like Aretha,

886
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:26,816
like Miss Franklin,
not because they're Negroes.

887
00:54:26,883 --> 00:54:28,385
These guys are
the best musicians

888
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:29,919
I have ever
worked with in my life,

889
00:54:29,987 --> 00:54:31,754
and that's saying something.

890
00:54:31,821 --> 00:54:33,257
I've been doing this
a long time.

891
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:35,059
They don't need
to read charts.

892
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,094
They just feel their way
through the music.

893
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:39,396
It's really something.
How does that sound to you?

894
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:42,266
Sounds good.

895
00:54:42,333 --> 00:54:45,069
And I'm not controlling
like Hammond, okay?

896
00:54:45,135 --> 00:54:46,670
I'm gonna give you
plenty of space

897
00:54:46,736 --> 00:54:48,172
to do your thing, all right?

898
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,507
This is your show,
Miss Franklin.

899
00:54:50,574 --> 00:54:51,709

900
00:54:51,774 --> 00:54:53,143

cotton in these parts, huh?

923

Percy Sledge had

925

And then he heard 'em play

926

01:24:32,756 --> 01:24:34,158
I can tell.

1441
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:39,030
See, so, she's just
being completely honest

1442
01:24:40,164 --> 01:24:41,865
in a song about
what she feels

1443
01:24:41,931 --> 01:24:43,968
<i>at any given moment.</i>

1444
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:45,835
<i>And that's why
the audience relates to her.</i>

1445
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:49,974
I'm still trying
to figure out who I am.

1446
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,741
I'm not sure yet,

1447
01:24:51,808 --> 01:24:54,045
but I'm trying
to find the answer.

1448
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:07,690
Now, I am here
to honor Aretha.

1449
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:12,196
Or Ree, as I like
to call her...

1450
01:25:12,263 --> 01:25:15,932
...for her tireless work
for the Civil Rights Movement.

1451
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:18,601
Every time

1452
01:25:18,668 --> 01:25:22,739
I ask Aretha to sing
at a fundraiser,

1453
01:25:22,806 --> 01:25:25,742
church event, or a conference,

1454
01:25:25,809 --> 01:25:27,278
she shows up.

1455
01:25:29,013 --> 01:25:32,016
No matter where she is
or what she's doing,

1456
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:34,884
she always answers the call.

1457
01:25:34,951 --> 01:25:38,556
And I am honored
to present Aretha

1458
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:41,658
with this proclamation today.

1459
01:25:46,997 --> 01:25:50,501
And I wish that every day

1460
01:25:50,568 --> 01:25:53,104
was Aretha Franklin Day!

1461
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:56,440
We love you, Aretha!

1462
01:25:56,507 --> 01:25:57,740
After all of that,

1463
01:25:59,210 --> 01:26:00,544
there's really only one thing
left to say, right?

1464
01:26:13,257 --> 01:26:17,394

1484
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:36,473
Excuse me, Miss Franklin.

1485
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,142
I'm so sorry to bother you,

1486
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:39,410
- but I just have to tell you.
- It's all right.

1487
01:27:39,476 --> 01:27:40,411
When you sing,

1488
01:27:41,945 --> 01:27:43,480
I feel like you are
talking about my life.

1489
01:27:43,547 --> 01:27:46,183
It helps me,
because it is hard out here.

1490
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,152
But I feel like
you understand,

1491
01:27:48,219 --> 01:27:51,088
and, well, I just
have to thank you.

1492
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:53,490
Stay strong.

1493
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:56,660
Okay.

1494
01:27:56,726 --> 01:27:58,629
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1495
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:00,231
We have to go now.

1496
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,371
I'm flying to Atlanta tomorrow
to do a benefit for SNCC.

1497
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:12,376
Cancel it.

1498
01:28:13,876 --> 01:28:16,180
I have some meetings
and interviews lined up.

1499
01:28:16,746 --> 01:28:18,148
No.

1500
01:28:18,215 --> 01:28:20,084
Daddy and Martin
asked me to do it.

1501
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:22,253
I'm going.

1502
01:28:38,736 --> 01:28:39,869
Aretha!

1503
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,405
Jerry.

1504
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:42,939
Oh, I love
when you call me Jerry.

1505
01:28:43,007 --> 01:28:44,275
It means you're not mad at me.

1506
01:28:44,341 --> 01:28:45,409
Hello, Ted.

1507
01:28:45,476 --> 01:28:46,710
Jerry.

1508
01:28:46,776 --> 01:28:48,312
Come on in.

1509
01:28:48,379 --> 01:28:50,947
Everyone wants you,
Miss Franklin.

1510
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:53,417
We've got interest in France,
England, Germany...

1511
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:55,219
All right, we don't
have to name every country.

1512
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:56,853
All of Europe.

1513
01:28:56,919 --> 01:28:58,522
The entire continent wants you

1514
01:28:58,589 --> 01:28:59,922
and I think we should
schedule something.

1515
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,458
We should schedule a tour

1516
01:29:01,525 --> 01:29:03,294
that coincides
with the new album.

1517
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,162
We could do that
or we could send her out now

1518
01:29:05,229 --> 01:29:06,530
to create an appetite
for the new record.

1519
01:29:06,597 --> 01:29:08,098
I think that's best.

1520
01:29:08,165 --> 01:29:09,333
I have six venues
ready to clear this...

1521
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,567
And who are you,

1522
01:29:10,634 --> 01:29:12,436
brother?

1523
01:29:14,204 --> 01:29:17,840
Ken Cunningham.
I'm the tour manager.

1524
01:29:18,808 --> 01:29:20,778
Tour manager?

1525
01:29:20,843 --> 01:29:21,844
So, you already
booked the tour?

1526
01:29:21,911 --> 01:29:23,380
It's not booked.

1527
01:29:23,447 --> 01:29:25,449
No, he said
the venues was ready.

1528
01:29:25,516 --> 01:29:27,217
That's right. They were
available if we want 'em.

1529
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:28,986
You have to gauge
interest early for it.

1530
01:29:29,053 --> 01:29:30,321
- I know how a tour works.
- Okay.

1531
01:29:30,387 --> 01:29:31,755
- No.
- No what?

1532
01:29:31,821 --> 01:29:33,457
No European tour dates.

1533
01:29:33,524 --> 01:29:34,525
Why not?

1534
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:36,327
Because

1535
01:29:36,393 --> 01:29:37,860
we have some TV dates
we'd like to schedule first.

1536
01:29:37,927 --> 01:29:39,563
Oh, yeah? With whom?

1537
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:43,400
Carol Burnett, Andy Williams.
Mike Douglas.

1538
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:45,469
All right. So, those shows
will be there

1539
01:29:45,536 --> 01:29:46,670
when she gets back.

1540
01:29:46,737 --> 01:29:48,205
We have a chance here

1541
01:29:48,272 --> 01:29:50,074
to expand her reach
around the world.

1542
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:52,276
To make her
a global superstar.

1543
01:29:52,343 --> 01:29:55,346
Do you know what
a rare opportunity that is?

1544
01:29:55,412 --> 01:29:57,081
We're considering
some movie offers as well.

1545
01:29:57,147 --> 01:29:58,582
Movies?

1546
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:00,384
Aretha. You wanna do movies?

1547
01:30:01,618 --> 01:30:02,786
I think I could.

1548
01:30:02,852 --> 01:30:04,421
Of course you could.

1549
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:06,490
You could do
any damn thing you want.

1550
01:30:08,225 --> 01:30:10,027
You thought you could
just bring us in here,

1551
01:30:10,094 --> 01:30:11,928
tell us where to go,
what to do,

1552
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:13,297
and send us on our way?

1553
01:30:13,364 --> 01:30:15,032
You should know by now, Jerry,

1554
01:30:15,099 --> 01:30:17,034
that is not the way
I do business.

1555
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:20,070
Ken, how much money
could Aretha make on the tour?

1556
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:21,505
Quarter of a million.

1557
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:25,242
Carol Burnett
payin' that?

1558
01:30:26,076 --> 01:30:28,479
Movies payin' that?

1559
01:30:28,545 --> 01:30:32,049
We'll consider it.
With the right band.

1560
01:30:32,116 --> 01:30:34,184
All right.

1561
01:30:34,251 --> 01:30:35,952
Well, the Muscle Shoals guys
have started their own label.

1562
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:37,688
King Curtis is ready to go.

1563
01:30:37,755 --> 01:30:39,690
- Curtis is rockin'.
- He's perfect for you.

1564
01:30:39,757 --> 01:30:42,192
Curtis is good, but I've got
some people lined up.

1565
01:30:42,259 --> 01:30:43,761
Really? Five minutes ago,

1566
01:30:43,827 --> 01:30:45,195
you didn't wanna
go on this tour.

1567
01:30:45,262 --> 01:30:46,997
Now, you've got
people lined up?

1568
01:30:47,064 --> 01:30:48,232
Check the tone, Jerry.

1569
01:30:48,298 --> 01:30:50,200
Just take it easy, Ted.

1570
01:30:50,267 --> 01:30:54,271
I'm sorry.
Forgive me for my tone.

1571
01:30:54,338 --> 01:30:56,906
What musicians
do you have lined up, Ted?

1572
01:30:57,775 --> 01:30:59,343
George Davidson.

1573
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,745
Miller Brisker.
Russell Conway.

1574
01:31:01,812 --> 01:31:04,947
All right. You can't have
the premier singer of our time

1575
01:31:05,015 --> 01:31:07,518
touring Europe with a ragtag
bunch of amateurs

1576
01:31:07,584 --> 01:31:10,421
suitable for backing
some third-rate blues singer

1577
01:31:10,487 --> 01:31:12,389
in a bucket of blood
in Loserville, Louisiana.

1578
01:31:12,456 --> 01:31:15,092
I want to use Ted's musicians,
Mr. Wexler.

1579
01:31:15,159 --> 01:31:16,894
"Mr. Wexler"?

1580
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,696
Oh, God. Aretha, please.

1581
01:31:19,763 --> 01:31:20,964
Can we move on

1582
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:23,300
to the next item
on the agenda, please?

1583
01:31:28,472 --> 01:31:31,442
Whatever you say,
Miss Franklin.

1584
01:31:35,379 --> 01:31:37,114
So, they do
this funny thing in Amsterdam

1585
01:31:37,181 --> 01:31:38,715
when they really
love a performer.

1586
01:31:39,883 --> 01:31:41,452
They pelt them with flowers.

1587
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:43,020
Pardon me.

1588
01:31:43,086 --> 01:31:44,555
I warned them not
to get too crazy with it,

1589
01:31:44,621 --> 01:31:46,390
but you might
get hit with a few.

1590
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:47,891
After the show, please.
After the show.

1591
01:31:47,958 --> 01:31:49,092
<i>Right through this door.</i>

1592
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:51,795
Watch your step.

Can you comment on the recent
<i>Time</i> magazine cover story?

1621
01:33:25,188 --> 01:33:26,857
<i>Oh, I haven't read it yet,</i>

1622
01:33:26,924 --> 01:33:28,559
<i>but it is a great honor
to grace the cover</i>

1623
01:33:28,625 --> 01:33:30,093
<i>of such
a prestigious magazine.</i>

1624
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:35,098
This <i>Time</i> article
says that your husband

1625
01:33:35,165 --> 01:33:36,900
beat you in a hotel lobby.

1626
01:33:36,968 --> 01:33:38,101
Excuse me?

1627
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:45,242
Is this true?

1628
01:33:45,309 --> 01:33:47,244
No more questions!
Let's go!

1629
01:33:47,311 --> 01:33:49,379
Move.

1630
01:33:52,816 --> 01:33:54,117
It's a lie!

1631
01:33:55,053 --> 01:33:56,988
It's a dirty lie!

1632
01:33:57,055 --> 01:33:58,589
Get off! Come here!

1633
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:03,027
No, that's too low.
I want $10 million.

1634
01:34:08,765 --> 01:34:11,468
They're gonna be sorry
they wrote this shit.

1635
01:34:12,336 --> 01:34:14,005
And you know, your daddy,

1636
01:34:14,072 --> 01:34:15,539
he doesn't come across
too well either.

1637
01:34:15,606 --> 01:34:17,507
He may wanna sue 'em
his damn self.

1638
01:34:17,574 --> 01:34:18,709
How are you gonna prove
that you didn't hit me?

1639
01:34:20,243 --> 01:34:22,613
You did and everyone saw it!

1640
01:34:24,414 --> 01:34:27,184
Another man would
have killed you by now.

1641
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:29,152
Crazy way you act.

1642
01:34:31,221 --> 01:34:32,957
Get out of my way.

1643
01:34:33,024 --> 01:34:34,157
What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do?

1644
01:34:34,224 --> 01:34:35,325
I mean it.

1645
01:34:37,227 --> 01:34:38,795
You would still be singing

1646
01:34:38,862 --> 01:34:41,231
some Al Jolson shit
if it wasn't for me.

1647
01:34:41,298 --> 01:34:42,899
I wrote half your hits.

1648
01:34:44,234 --> 01:34:45,869
Are you laughing at me?

1649
01:34:45,936 --> 01:34:47,638
You know damn well
you didn't write one word.

1650
01:34:48,505 --> 01:34:50,173
One note of anything.

1651
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:51,675
I just let you put
your name on it

1652
01:34:51,742 --> 01:34:53,477
to keep you
from throwing a fit.

1653
01:34:53,543 --> 01:34:55,113
<i>I Never Loved A Man</i>
came from me.

1654
01:34:55,178 --> 01:34:56,847
My songwriter!

1655
01:34:56,913 --> 01:34:59,716
That song wasn't anything
until I rearranged it.

1656
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:02,786
And I sang the hell out of it
because it was about you.

1657
01:35:02,853 --> 01:35:05,822
You're a lying, no good,

1658
01:35:05,889 --> 01:35:08,993
just useless, psychopath.

1659
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,395
No!

1660
01:35:16,034 --> 01:35:17,734
I'm done with you.

1661
01:35:19,703 --> 01:35:22,406
Yeah, you've said that before.

1662
01:35:22,472 --> 01:35:24,341
You wait until
your demons come back!

1663
01:35:25,542 --> 01:35:27,544
After livin' with you,

1664
01:35:28,445 --> 01:35:30,480
I'm ready for 'em.

1665
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:05,315
This song goes out

1666
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:09,720
to anyone who has
ever felt mistreated.

1667

that ain't too much, Ree?

yes, I did.

- Put her foot in, she did.

I don't know.
That smells funny.

Get outta here!

1725
01:40:50,734 --> 01:40:51,801
All right, put it back.

No, no, no.

He kept telling me

1763
01:43:44,208 --> 01:43:46,177
that they were gonna get him.

1764
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:52,682
But I said, "Martin, the Lord
has more for you to do.

1765
01:43:53,651 --> 01:43:55,818
You're gonna be all right."

1766
01:43:57,820 --> 01:43:59,089
But he knew.

1767
01:44:00,191 --> 01:44:01,925
He knew.

1768
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:05,795
Other ministers
were jealous of him,

1769
01:44:06,729 --> 01:44:08,332
- but I never was.
- Mm.

1770
01:44:09,266 --> 01:44:10,934
He was my friend.

1771
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:13,803
- I ministered him...
- Yeah.

1772
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:15,206
...advised him.

1773
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:17,408
Prayed with him.

1774
01:44:18,942 --> 01:44:21,212
- Yes, you did.
- More time than I can count.

1775
01:44:23,846 --> 01:44:25,516
I loved him, Ree.

1776
01:44:25,583 --> 01:44:27,351
He loved you.

1777
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:34,225
Who's gonna lead us now?

1778
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,062
They don't listen
to me anymore.

1779
01:44:38,128 --> 01:44:41,265
You still have
the biggest church in Detroit.

1780
01:44:42,466 --> 01:44:44,235
I still know
how to get 'em goin'.

1781
01:44:45,202 --> 01:44:46,503
- Yes, you do.
- I do.

1782
01:44:46,570 --> 01:44:48,205
Can I join you?

1783
01:44:48,272 --> 01:44:50,307
No. I just wanna talk to Ree.
Can I do that?

1784
01:44:50,374 --> 01:44:52,176
- Can I just talk to Ree?
- Of course you can.

1785
01:44:52,243 --> 01:44:53,776
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
- Of course you can.

1786
01:44:55,045 --> 01:44:57,747
Um, I'll be right there
when you need me.

1787
01:44:59,882 --> 01:45:01,851
They need leadership, Ree.

1788
01:45:03,786 --> 01:45:05,422
You should see
the way these fools

1789
01:45:05,489 --> 01:45:08,825
are steppin' over
Martin's body to be in charge.

1790
01:45:08,891 --> 01:45:11,128
I don't want no part of that.

1791
01:45:12,396 --> 01:45:16,100
And these young
revolutionaries out here,

1792
01:45:16,166 --> 01:45:17,900
they don't want
no part of what we built.

1793
01:45:19,003 --> 01:45:21,672
They want to free our people.

1794
01:45:21,739 --> 01:45:23,674
They all talk.

1795
01:45:23,741 --> 01:45:26,277
Not all of them.
I like Angela Davis.

1796
01:45:28,045 --> 01:45:30,414
She don't care
about public opinion

1797
01:45:30,481 --> 01:45:32,216
and she's not afraid
to speak up

1798
01:45:32,283 --> 01:45:34,718
to those pigs or anyone else.

1799
01:45:34,784 --> 01:45:38,022
- Pigs?
- Yes, pigs.

1800
01:45:38,088 --> 01:45:39,590
You saw what they did to us
during the rebellion.

1801
01:45:39,657 --> 01:45:41,058
Riots.

1802
01:45:42,026 --> 01:45:43,893
Why shouldn't we fight back?

1803
01:45:43,961 --> 01:45:46,430
And start a full-on war?
You think we can win that?

1804
01:45:46,497 --> 01:45:48,198
We're tired of gettin'
our heads kicked in.

1805
01:45:48,265 --> 01:45:51,635
Non-violence
got us our civil rights

1806
01:45:51,702 --> 01:45:53,737
and our right to vote.

1807
01:45:53,803 --> 01:45:55,372
At what price? Our souls?

1808
01:45:55,439 --> 01:45:56,573
Our dignity?

1809
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:58,808
Hmm.

1810
01:46:01,844 --> 01:46:03,580
I've been thinking.

1811
01:46:05,983 --> 01:46:08,118
We should hit the road again.

1812
01:46:10,554 --> 01:46:11,854
Why not?

1813
01:46:11,921 --> 01:46:13,724
A northern tour.

1814
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:16,794
Me preachin' and you singin'.

1815
01:46:16,859 --> 01:46:17,995
Mm-mmm.

1816
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:23,133
Just think on it.

1817
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,802
You don't gotta
decide tonight.

1818
01:46:24,867 --> 01:46:26,337
I'm not doing that, Daddy.

1819
01:46:27,604 --> 01:46:29,807
I know you got
your very busy tourin'

1820
01:46:29,872 --> 01:46:31,275
and recordin' schedule.

1821
01:46:31,342 --> 01:46:33,010
This won't interfere
with that.

1822
01:46:33,077 --> 01:46:34,478
- I won't interfere with that.
- No.

1823
01:46:35,878 --> 01:46:38,582
I'm done with that.

1824
01:46:38,649 --> 01:46:41,018
I can't go back
to headlining with you.

1825
01:46:47,224 --> 01:46:50,227
You're not walkin'
in the spirit anymore.

1826
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:54,331
That is not true.

1827
01:46:54,398 --> 01:46:57,501
You're drinking
and you're whoring around.

1828
01:46:57,568 --> 01:46:59,203
Same as you!

1829
01:46:59,269 --> 01:47:01,105
You not too old for me
to knock you on your ass!

1830
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:02,973
- You know that, right?
- Is everything all right?

1831
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,641
Just mind your own business!
I'm talkin' to...

1832
01:47:04,708 --> 01:47:05,976
Don't talk to her like that.

1833
01:47:06,043 --> 01:47:08,445
Have you lost your mind, huh?

1834
01:47:08,512 --> 01:47:10,381
Maybe.

1835
01:47:10,447 --> 01:47:12,383
Maybe I found it.

1836
01:47:15,652 --> 01:47:16,919
Come on, let's get you to bed.

1837
01:47:16,987 --> 01:47:18,655
Just...

1838
01:47:18,722 --> 01:47:20,524
Just don't.

1839
01:47:32,002 --> 01:47:34,805
- I heard your conversation.
- Mm...

1840
01:47:34,872 --> 01:47:36,473
I'm not sorry.

1841
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,475
No, no, you ain't got nothin'
to be sorry for.

1842
01:47:39,942 --> 01:47:42,079
Just do your thing, Ree.

1843
01:47:43,247 --> 01:47:47,551
And you do it
as big and as loud

1844
01:47:47,618 --> 01:47:49,420
and as long as you can.

1845
01:48:19,349 --> 01:48:23,454
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la, la,

1846
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,791
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la, la,

<i>♪ There's a rose in black
at Spanish Harlem ♪</i>

1848
01:48:33,363 --> 01:48:36,266
Please, just listen
to it again, okay?

1849
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:38,402
I have a great feeling
about this song,

1850
01:48:38,469 --> 01:48:40,404
and The Beatles
are getting restless.

1851
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:42,806
They said if you
don't do it, they will.

1852
01:48:42,873 --> 01:48:44,808
The song is Catholic, Jerry.

1853
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:46,610
I'm a Baptist.

1854
01:48:46,677 --> 01:48:48,479
That's... That's crazy.

1855
01:48:48,545 --> 01:48:50,247
- You thought that's gonna...
- They caught Angela Davis.

1856
01:48:50,314 --> 01:48:51,548
- What?
- That can't be right.

1857
01:48:51,615 --> 01:48:53,450
No, no, no, no.

1858
01:48:53,517 --> 01:48:55,552
<i>Angela Davis,
a young Black militant</i>

1859
01:48:55,619 --> 01:48:57,421
<i>who has been hunted
for nearly two months</i>

1860
01:48:57,488 --> 01:48:59,356
<i>on murder
and kidnapping charges,</i>

1861
01:49:01,024 --> 01:49:03,260
<i>was arrested yesterday at a
hotel in midtown Manhattan</i>

1862
01:49:03,327 --> 01:49:05,429
<i>by agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.</i>

1863
01:49:07,631 --> 01:49:10,167
Angela Davis
must go free.

1864
01:49:10,234 --> 01:49:12,736
Black people will be free.

1865
01:49:12,803 --> 01:49:15,239
My daddy says
I don't know what I'm doing.

1866
01:49:15,305 --> 01:49:17,374
I respect him, of course,

1867
01:49:17,441 --> 01:49:20,344
but I have to stick
by my beliefs.

1868
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:24,781
You have to disturb the peace
when you can't get no peace.

1869
01:49:31,054 --> 01:49:32,823
What the hell
is this tour schedule?

1870
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:34,925
- Half the damn dates are gone!
- All right, all right,

1871
01:49:34,993 --> 01:49:36,827
we were just about to have
a talk with you about this.

1872
01:49:36,894 --> 01:49:38,295
We?

1873
01:49:38,362 --> 01:49:39,796
We're not having
a family barbecue?

1874
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:42,666
This is one of these
Ken hippie talks?

1875
01:49:42,733 --> 01:49:43,934
I told you this wasn't
gonna work.

1876
01:49:44,002 --> 01:49:45,102
Just breathe.

1877
01:49:45,168 --> 01:49:46,637
Put the damn dates back.

1878
01:49:46,703 --> 01:49:48,071
Don't do it, Cecil.
Listen, Ree...

1879
01:49:48,138 --> 01:49:49,273
You work for me, Cecil.

1880
01:49:49,339 --> 01:49:51,009
You overbook.

1881
01:49:51,074 --> 01:49:52,576
You don't show up
for half the dates,

1882
01:49:52,643 --> 01:49:53,944
then I have to
deal with the fallout.

1883
01:49:54,012 --> 01:49:55,379
It's your damn job!

1884
01:49:55,445 --> 01:49:56,914
We're trying to help you.

1885
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:58,749
Aretha, you need to slow down.

1886
01:49:58,815 --> 01:50:00,083
You stop for five minutes,
they forget all about you.

1887
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:01,852
That's ridiculous.

1888
01:50:01,919 --> 01:50:03,654
How would you know, Erma?
You barely have one hit.

1889
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,222
Ree,
you haven't slept in months.

1890
01:50:05,289 --> 01:50:07,357
And you look like it.

1891
01:50:07,424 --> 01:50:09,159
You don't want me to tell you
what you look like, Carolyn.

1892
01:50:09,226 --> 01:50:10,627
Well, next time
you have a breakdown,

1893
01:50:10,694 --> 01:50:11,728
don't call us, all right?

1894
01:50:14,765 --> 01:50:15,832
I won't.

1895
01:50:17,434 --> 01:50:19,102
Come on,
let's go outside. Come on.

1896
01:50:19,169 --> 01:50:21,071
And don't call me
when you need a gig,

1897
01:50:21,138 --> 01:50:25,309
or you want me to write liner
notes in your jive-ass album,

1898
01:50:25,375 --> 01:50:27,578
or introduce you
to some producers,

1899
01:50:27,644 --> 01:50:31,315
or just borrow some cash
that your ass never pay back.

1900
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:33,750
If I don't work,
y'all don't eat.

1901
01:50:34,818 --> 01:50:36,453
Right.

1902
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,355
Put the damn dates
back, Cecil.

1903
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:45,562
Three venues in three states
in three days.

1904
01:50:45,629 --> 01:50:48,398
- Happy now?
- Yes, I am.

1905
01:50:48,465 --> 01:50:50,667
And don't ever pull that
bullshit with me again.

1906
01:50:50,734 --> 01:50:52,603
I know how to run
my damn business.

1907

Y'all just wanna

- Please.

1910
01:50:59,343 --> 01:51:02,412
Ree, think about our son.
This isn't good for him.

1911

Don't tell me
I'm a bad mother.

02:03:41,038 --> 02:03:43,173
Okay. Well, can we just...

2067
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:45,142
I... I mean,
just think about this...

2068
02:03:45,209 --> 02:03:47,811
This album is not for me
or for you or anybody else.

2069
02:03:47,877 --> 02:03:49,546
This album is for God.

2070
02:03:49,613 --> 02:03:52,850
And you can't jive God, Jerry,
so stop trying.

2071
02:03:52,949 --> 02:03:54,518
Oh.

2072
02:03:54,585 --> 02:03:58,255
I'm not trying to jive you
or Jesus, okay?

2073
02:04:00,124 --> 02:04:02,025
It's the gospel record.

2074
02:04:03,527 --> 02:04:07,264
It's 1972, for Christ's sake.
Sorry. I...

2075
02:04:07,831 --> 02:04:08,999
Hey,

2076
02:04:10,134 --> 02:04:12,669
how about we make
a documentary film

2077
02:04:12,736 --> 02:04:13,704
to go along with the record?

2078
02:04:13,771 --> 02:04:15,339
Why?

2079
02:04:15,406 --> 02:04:17,741
So, the international fans,
the hippies,

2080
02:04:17,808 --> 02:04:20,544
the atheists like me
can see you in your element

2081
02:04:20,611 --> 02:04:22,980
and understand the music
that made you.

2082
02:04:23,046 --> 02:04:25,416
You mean for white people?

2083
02:04:25,482 --> 02:04:27,017
Well, I...

2084
02:04:27,917 --> 02:04:29,420
All right. Yes.

2085
02:04:31,655 --> 02:04:33,223
That's a great idea.

2086
02:04:34,792 --> 02:04:36,493
Okay. Well, good.
So, you're not gonna leave me?

2087
02:04:37,528 --> 02:04:38,695
We're not done yet.

2088
02:04:38,762 --> 02:04:41,965
Oh, boy. What?

2089
02:04:42,032 --> 02:04:44,435
I want to produce
the album, too.

2090
02:04:45,536 --> 02:04:46,470
Oh.

2091
02:04:50,707 --> 02:04:53,510
All right. Okay. Okay.

2092
02:04:56,313 --> 02:04:59,750
<i>♪ Flood my soul ♪</i>

Hold! Hold!

2094
02:05:04,588 --> 02:05:06,990
You have to do something
with the longer notes.

2095
02:05:07,057 --> 02:05:09,460
You're not giving yourself
anywhere to go.

2096
02:05:09,526 --> 02:05:12,262
Start straight, then hit
the vibrato halfway through.

2097
02:05:12,329 --> 02:05:13,597
Tension
and release, y'all.

2098
02:05:15,232 --> 02:05:17,267
Yes, and this song
is a lot more, uh, deliberate.

2099
02:05:17,334 --> 02:05:19,136
- Mm.
- Yeah?

2100
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:21,505

where we left off.

Okay, all right,
we're gonna take a ten.

2127
02:07:19,222 --> 02:07:21,658
Let's take ten. Let's, uh...

2128
02:07:31,002 --> 02:07:32,469
Are you all right?

2129
02:07:32,536 --> 02:07:35,472
I can't make a fool
out of myself.

2130
02:07:35,539 --> 02:07:37,674
There's gonna be
a film crew here.

2131
02:07:40,377 --> 02:07:42,679
And if I break down
like I did right now,

2132
02:07:42,746 --> 02:07:44,681
they gonna think
I lost my mind.

2133
02:07:44,748 --> 02:07:46,249
Ree...

2134
02:07:48,218 --> 02:07:51,288
Ree, the spirit is the spirit.

2135
02:07:51,355 --> 02:07:53,290
It moves when it moves.

2136
02:07:53,357 --> 02:07:55,626
What you want us to do?
Behave like Episcopalians?

2137
02:07:57,996 --> 02:07:59,630
Now what's really
bothering you?

2138
02:08:02,033 --> 02:08:03,900
You told me once

2139
02:08:05,369 --> 02:08:08,572
that music would save my life.

2140
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:10,907
I did.

2141
02:08:11,942 --> 02:08:13,410
What if it doesn't?

2142
02:08:14,378 --> 02:08:16,446
The demon is strong.

2143
02:08:16,513 --> 02:08:18,949
Ain't no demon
hauntin' you, Ree.

2144
02:08:19,017 --> 02:08:20,450
There never was.

2145
02:08:21,952 --> 02:08:24,921
Just the pain you've been
runnin' from your whole life.

2146
02:08:26,991 --> 02:08:29,526
But you gotta let it go, Ree.

2147
02:08:31,129 --> 02:08:33,296
Give it to God.

2148
02:08:35,265 --> 02:08:36,533
It wasn't your fault.

2149
02:08:39,469 --> 02:08:41,405
And He knows that.

2150
02:08:44,608 --> 02:08:47,511
I don't know about tomorrow

2151
02:08:47,577 --> 02:08:51,682
or the concert or the album
or the documentary.

2152
02:08:52,549 --> 02:08:55,285
You in church right now.

2153
02:08:56,186 --> 02:08:58,221
You're safe.

2154
02:08:59,289 --> 02:09:01,425
So, Ree,

2155
02:09:02,225 --> 02:09:03,961
let's have church.

2156
02:09:53,376 --> 02:09:54,644
Daddy.

2157
02:09:57,347 --> 02:09:58,648
It's good to see you.

2158
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:03,620
We were in California, and

2159
02:10:03,687 --> 02:10:05,889
we heard that you were
singing gospel, and...

2160
02:10:07,959 --> 02:10:09,493
Clara dragged me here.

2161
02:10:09,559 --> 02:10:11,828
Clara can't make
you do anything.

2162
02:10:11,895 --> 02:10:13,797
She's got pretty feisty
since you last saw her.

2163
02:10:14,999 --> 02:10:15,967
Glad you came.

2164
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:18,535
That surprises me,

2165
02:10:18,602 --> 02:10:20,904
'cause we haven't been
getting on as of late.

2166
02:10:22,405 --> 02:10:25,042
You told me I wasn't
walking in the spirit.

2167
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:26,043
I was angry.

2168
02:10:27,011 --> 02:10:28,578
You were with God.

2169
02:10:28,645 --> 02:10:30,413
You have always been with God.

2170
02:10:31,848 --> 02:10:33,884
He was with me.

2171
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:36,787
I tried to run from Him,
but He brought me back.

2172
02:10:37,487 --> 02:10:38,622
Like Jonah.

2173
02:10:39,422 --> 02:10:40,857
Like Jonah.

2174
02:10:44,061 --> 02:10:46,797
You taught me every song
I'm singing today.

2175
02:10:51,301 --> 02:10:52,569
I did my best.

2176
02:10:54,938 --> 02:10:57,975
But you have exceeded
all of my expectations, Ree.

2177
02:10:59,342 --> 02:11:02,213
I'm about to bust wide open,

2178
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:05,016
and you're just
getting started.

2179
02:11:05,082 --> 02:11:09,586
I can't imagine
what you're gonna do next.

2180
02:11:10,988 --> 02:11:12,856
Because you can
do anything, Ree.

2181
02:11:17,427 --> 02:11:19,362
First, give an honor to God

2182
02:11:19,429 --> 02:11:21,698
who's the head
of all our lives.

2183
02:11:21,765 --> 02:11:24,235
Yes. Amen.

2184
02:11:24,302 --> 02:11:27,370
I'm sure you all have
noticed the cameras by now.

2185
02:11:28,438 --> 02:11:31,408
Don't get distracted by it.

2186
02:11:31,474 --> 02:11:33,077
We here to have church, right?

2187
02:11:33,144 --> 02:11:35,712
- Amen.
- All right.

2188
02:11:35,779 --> 02:11:39,683
This is the first
religious recordin'

2189
02:11:39,749 --> 02:11:43,653
by our First Lady of Soul.

2190
02:11:43,720 --> 02:11:47,390
Give a warm round of applause
for Miss Aretha Franklin.

2191
02:12:23,627 --> 02:12:25,029
We love you.
