00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,693
Shit.

3
00:00:56,967 --> 00:00:58,200
Sam.

4
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:00,869
Sam, wake up.

5
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:02,170
What's wrong?

6
00:01:03,974 --> 00:01:05,907
Fuck.

7
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,743
What'd you do, Tiger?

8
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:11,113
- When did we crash?
- You tell us, asshole.

9
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:13,682
I guess I fell asleep.

10
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:14,716
Yeah...

11
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:16,585
with the engine running.

12
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:21,156
Fully charged.

13
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:22,324
Did you kill the battery too?

14
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:24,026
You hear the radio?

15
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,601
There's a skating rink
about 11 miles from here.

16
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,102
Big parking lot.

17
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:36,938
Ice skating
or rollerskating?

18
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,040
Just says they're open.

19
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:38,974
Why?

20
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,842
Hockey players whoop more ass.

21
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:43,211
I don't know, dude. I've seen some
pretty bad-ass roller skaters.

22
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:44,880
At 7:00 AM?

23
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:47,149
All right,
I'll come with.

24
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,019
- Sam?
- Tad.

25
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,654
Awesome.

26
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,288
Hey, I work nights, but I'll catch
up with you guys for breakfast.

27
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,491
- Okay.
- I'm in 2-R up the stairs.

28
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:39,161
Just crash wherever.
Uh, park in the side lot.

29
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:41,129
Rear doors tight to the walls
so no one steals your shit.

30
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:42,364
All right.

31
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:44,032
Yeah?

32
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:03,785
These all have mushrooms.

33
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,187
This dude's legit.

34
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:08,456
Why? 'Cause he wakes up
at 5:00 in the morning

35
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,058
to put jizz in his hair?

36
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,293
Mm...

37
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:13,361
No. He's true.

38
00:04:18,435 --> 00:04:19,968
Ree-Ree.

39
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,139
Who you callin'?

40
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:25,774
Is that your business?

41
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,309
I get the bills.

42
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,110
I'm going to bed.

43
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,846
We're gonna drink.

44
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:32,380

47
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,009
Hello.

48
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:02,931
You were the first
to fall asleep?

49
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:16,925
Okay, I'm with the Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.

50
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,526
Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.

51
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:22,163
Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.

52
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,398
Not for the zine?

53
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,033
I'll do
a print version for that,

54
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:26,835
but this will run
on our college station.

55
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:27,936
Uh, if that's cool.

56
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:28,904
Yeah.

57
00:05:28,906 --> 00:05:31,539
So, you guys working
on anything new?

58
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,074
Mm, yeah. A few songs.

59
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,943
Maybe enough for,
like, a seven inch.

60
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:36,544
Sweet. Will you
actually press one?

61
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,013
Yeah, if we can afford it.

62
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:39,915
Yeah, no, I really dig
the analog style.

63
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,283
Uh, which brings
me to the fact

64
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:42,951
you guys are hard to find.

65
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:44,619
Why no social media presence?

66
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,055
That's because
booking more shows,

67
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:48,957
selling more records
would blow.

68
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,091
It's not hard rock.

69
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,494
No one wants to starve, but...

70
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:57,465
when you take it all virtual,
you lose...

71
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,301
the texture.

72
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,971
- What do you mean "texture"?
- Just... you gotta be there.

73
00:06:02,973 --> 00:06:05,507
The music is for effect.

74
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,376
It's time and aggression...

75
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:09,878
Technical wizardry.

76
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,013
And it's shared live...

77
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:14,382
and then it's over.

78
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:18,253
The energy can't last.

79
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,021
Unless you're Iggy Pop.

80
00:06:20,023 --> 00:06:21,589
Yeah, well good for him,
but I don't think I wanna

81
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,459
be in my 70's still listening
to Minor Threat.

82
00:06:24,461 --> 00:06:26,895
- But Tiger does.
- I won't live to be 70, so...

83
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:29,597
Okay, so, uh,
this is a good seg

84
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:30,932
into one of my traditions.

85
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:33,902
Uh, for each of you,
name your desert island band.

86
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,437
Only one?

87
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
If I were to
say Black Sabbath,

88
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,942
would I get
Ozzy and Dio?

89
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,311
No caveats.
Just name the band.

90
00:06:43,313 --> 00:06:44,412
Okay.

91
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,215
Misfits.

92
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,950
No, The Damned.

93
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:50,452
- Um...
- Oh, fuck it. Misfits.

94
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,387
- Poison Idea.
- Cro-Mags.

95
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:54,055
That's a good one also.

96
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:55,557
Why don't you say
something, dude?

97
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,026
What about Steely Dan?

98
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,495
- Hm. No, Candlebox.
- He's a juggalo.

99
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,265
- Uh... uh...
- Britney Spears?

100
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,002
Hey... hey, you...
you... you're gonna

101
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,703
edit this, right?
I can chop it up a bit.

102
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:11,706
- Oh, you should let it go raw, man.
- Um, when is this gonna air?

103
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,575
Like, maybe we should
plug the show?

104
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:15,710
Yeah. Um...

105
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:21,149
My last show at The Muni Center
didn't end well.

106
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:25,020
Uh, lots of vomit,
some fecal matter.

107
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:27,255
County commissioner got wind
and pulled my permit.

108
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:29,657
You guys were
already en route.

109
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:32,027
No, you gotta
give us a kill fee.

110
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,296
- We went 90 miles out of our way.
- I've got a backup lined up.

111
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:37,499
Um, lunch,
50% cut on the door,

112
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,167
and you guys would headline.

113
00:07:40,237 --> 00:07:42,003
Is anyone still on the bill?

114
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,271
No.

I gave you my cut.

126
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:27,382
Uh, the house got theirs,
but I didn't...

127
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,517
Split four ways,
it's six bucks each.

128
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,286
$6.87.

129
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:33,188
.88 if you just round up...

130
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,623
You dip-shit, fashion punk
clown motherfucker.

131
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,625
- Christ.
- Now easy there, jiu-jitsu.

132
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:39,861
Yeah. We don't wanna
go to jail, too.

133
00:08:41,098 --> 00:08:43,798
I think you just ended this tour.
Fuck yes. Let's call it.

134
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,602
All right, so we'd
have to beeline to DC.

135
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,037
We have enough
for one tank.

136
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:50,338
We'd have to siphon
the rest of the way.

137
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,339
That's not a problem.

138
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:53,241
We got rice and beans.

139
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:55,743
We can head up north.
Take the 80 all the way.

140
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:57,245
What the fuck
you doing, man?

141
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:59,347
Let me call my cousin.

142
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:00,782
I can get you guys
a solid gig.

143
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:02,317
Where? Here?

144
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,351
Scene is dead.

145
00:09:03,353 --> 00:09:05,433
You'd have to dip
down closer to Portland.

146
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,328
I say we just gank his vinyl.

147
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,366
All right, so all set.

148
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:20,502
Uh, matinée tomorrow.

149
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:22,403
Door's at 1:00,
you guys are on at 3:00.

150
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,239
- I texted the addy.
- How much?

151
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,640
Uh, $350.

152
00:09:25,642 --> 00:09:27,142
Minus your tab.

153
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:30,612
And, um, just so you know,
it's mostly boots and braces down there.

154
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:32,113
Skins? There's some
at every show.

155
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:33,848
What? D.M.S.? Sharp?

156
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,317
Uh, right-wing,
or technically ultra-left,

157
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,852
but not affiliated.

158
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:40,321
- And your cousin's cool?
- Yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:42,657
Uh, don't talk politics,
but stick with Daniel.

160
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:45,160
I'd tag along, but he and his
girl are coming here to crash.

161
00:09:45,162 --> 00:09:46,194
Gotta vacuum and shit.

162
00:09:46,196 --> 00:09:48,296
So they're not,
like, burning crosses

163
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,298
or anything, right?
Like, we just play rock?

164
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,133
Uh, I'd play
your earlier stuff.

165
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,801
Heavier stuff.

166

I usually keep the originals,

167
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,508

run that interview?

Yeah.

173
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:10,185
I'm sorry I almost
obliterated you, man.

174

Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

178
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:45,820
Yo, Pat...

179
00:10:47,624 --> 00:10:49,905
you know, there's something
I've never told people...

180
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,628
or anyone,
for that matter.

181
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:56,431

00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:32,813
Just relax!

325
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:35,683
Everyone, just relax.

326
00:19:35,685 --> 00:19:37,118
Cops are coming.

327
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:46,227
- See how easy that is?
- Motherfucker!

328
00:19:46,229 --> 00:19:48,696
Look what you did!
Amber, chill the fuck out!

329
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:50,898
Yes. Please.

330
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,470
- Darcy here?
- Not yet.

331
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,272
I need $600 cash.

332
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,374
You just signed out $350.

333
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,243
Somebody's dead.

334
00:20:05,348 --> 00:20:07,114
Still gotta keep the books.

335
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:14,789
What else do you need?

336
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,490
A true believer.

337
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,259
How 'bout two?

338
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,869
Maybe she's not dead.

339
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:29,970
I'm just saying.

340
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:31,906
Like, there's not
a lot of blood.

341
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,909
You know, so, like,
maybe she's just...

342
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:36,811
and who are we
to say that she's...

343
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:37,845
Oh, shit!

344
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,150
Come on, man.

345
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:46,153
What are you doing?

346
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:48,255
The fuck, man?

347
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:50,024
There it is.

348
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,559
Oh, my God.

349
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,834
We gotta go.
We gotta fucking go right now.

350
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,535
Now we didn't see shit.

351
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:05,039
We... we...
we were so drunk.

352
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,842
All right, just wait, okay?

353
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:10,477
Cops are on the way.

354
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,079
Above and beyond, gentlemen.

355
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,348
You need me to do it?

356
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,284
- Nope.
- Won't even be the first time.

357
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,221
Hurry up.

358
00:21:20,223 --> 00:21:22,103
Go.

359
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:26,460
All right, that's it.

360
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:29,930
Okay, let me see it.

361
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:31,999
The knife.

362
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:33,901
It's an inch too short
for felony possession,

363
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,103
so you don't have to worry
about the...

364
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:37,538
Actually, give me
that money back.

365
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,839
What?

366
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:39,940
It's like vouchers
and shit.

367
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,822
We'll hold it for you.
Come on.

368
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:46,106
If you do any time,
we'll double it.

369
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:56,423
Now talk to 'em.

370
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:04,231
- You the victim?
- Yes, officer.

371
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:05,366
Kneel down.

372
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:07,168
Both of you,
ankles crossed.

373
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,439
That's the owner.

374
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:14,642
I called him too.

375
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:19,847
All right, let's give them
some room to work, folks.

376
00:22:19,849 --> 00:22:21,382
Are you the owner?

377
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,183
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:22:46,075 --> 00:22:48,042
Cowcatcher, clear out.

379
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:50,277
Hey, where are the cops?

380
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,113
- Get your stuff, man.
- What about us?

381
00:22:53,115 --> 00:22:54,348
What are you doing?

382
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,451
We're sorting it out.
Just hang tight, Amber.

383
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,164
Your set was pretty good.

384
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,033
What?

385
00:23:16,572 --> 00:23:20,341
What was the name
of your second to last song?

386
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,077
Uh...

387
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:26,981
To... Toxic Evolution.

388
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:31,151
It's fucking hard, man.

389
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:35,522
That's the one
I did her to.

390
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:51,505
All right, he's got
six bullets...

391
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:53,407
- For real?
- ...if we all go at once...

392
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:55,275
- Guys, hold off a sec.
- For what?

393
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:57,478
- We haven't done anything!
- It doesn't matter.

394
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,948
Okay.
They're called cartridges.

395
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,284
The bullet is the part
that enters your brain

396
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:06,553
if you keep talking shit.

397
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:10,657
And this gun only has
five cartridges, not six,

398
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,695
'cause they're big as fuck
and only five fit the cylinder.

399
00:24:16,098 --> 00:24:21,035
So, please shut the fuck up
and don't test me.

400
00:24:21,037 --> 00:24:22,436
Reece, you're making it worse.

401
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:25,706
We sit and we wait.

402
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:27,408
And we die?

403
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:30,110
Not if you sit
and you wait.

404
00:24:30,112 --> 00:24:33,047
It's just the one
to 911 at 3:45

405
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,689
and then mine was at 3:47.
You called?

406
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:38,152
- 911 called back and I answered.
- Be clear.

407
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:40,721
Who else knows besides...
You said Daniel's cousin?

408
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,173
Tad.

409
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:43,624
There was a text from him
last night with our address,

410
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:44,691
but he doesn't know anything.

411
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,494
Except who they are,
where they are...

412
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:50,464
maybe where
they're supposed to be next.

413
00:24:50,466 --> 00:24:51,832
Fuck.

414
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:54,435
Check emails.

415
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:56,637
They played their set
to the crowd.

416
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,639
Then we'll assume
the wide world knows

417
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,741
and they'll be tracking that.

418
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,176
Give it to me.

419
00:25:02,178 --> 00:25:03,544
I was trying to
buy some time

420
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:05,279
and contain this
until we could...

421
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,014
Contain?

422
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:08,348
It was pretty rapid fire.

423
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,120
I appreciate your initiative
and we all love Werm.

424
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:14,421
He's a brother.

425
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:17,091
And you might have
visited him in prison.

426
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:19,693
Makes a difference.

427
00:25:20,796 --> 00:25:23,297
Now we're all
in the stew

428
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,699
for an impulsive act,

429
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,202
for a selfish act,

430
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:31,071
under my roof.

431
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:33,373
You see a way
out of this?

432
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,742
For them?

433
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,111
No.

434
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:38,512
We still have to find one.

435
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:45,352
Okay. This is good.

436
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:50,107
No guns.

437
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:52,559
You have a "No trespassing" sign
posted at the residence?

438
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,161
We got
"Beware of dogs."

439
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:55,462
That's better.

440
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:03,604
Does anyone even
know we're in here?

441
00:26:03,606 --> 00:26:06,440
No one who cares. Tad?

442
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:13,280
- I think we go.
- I think we go too.

443
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,084
The next person that moves...

444
00:26:17,086 --> 00:26:19,086
Everyone okay?

445
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,121
Just about.

446
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,422
Gabe?

447
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:23,524
- Yeah. Open up.
- No!

448
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:24,825
- Where are the cops?
- Okay...

449
00:26:24,827 --> 00:26:26,093
do you want
me to open the door,

450
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,228
or do you want me to blow
your fucking head off?

451
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,231
- Back the fuck off!
- What's going on?

452
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,332
They're trying to run at me!

453
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:33,500
Do not shoot them!

454
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,667
You know what?
That's on them.

455
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,669
Where are the cops?

456
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,271
Give them the gun!

457
00:26:37,273 --> 00:26:39,473
Say again?

458
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:41,141
It's over!

459
00:26:41,143 --> 00:26:42,543
Give them the gun.

460
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:44,811
Okay, I told you they just
tried to run at me...

461
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,380
Then take the bullets out!

462
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:47,581
Just hand it over now!

463
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,550
Do not shoot them!

464
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:50,918
Is Darcy here?

465
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:54,154
- He is.
- I am.

466
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:58,525
Gentlemen, I'm the owner.
Okay, why the fuck didn't you just tell me?

467
00:26:58,527 --> 00:26:59,893
Truly sorry about this.

468
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:01,895
Playing catch-up here myself.

469
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,597
They're playing
a fucking show.

470
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,766
Uh...

471
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:08,368
thank you, but...

472
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,170
we open the door
for the police,

473
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,506
or we keep the bullets.

474
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,342
Uh, the cartridges.

475
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:16,610
I've got no problem with that.

476
00:27:16,612 --> 00:27:18,745
Okay, I handed them the gun.

477
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:20,514
I'm gonna head out now.
No, you're not.

478
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,366
- Let him open the door.
- Hang on.

479
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,217
- No, he gave us the gun, he gave us the gun...
- Nobody is...

480
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,154
letting me do anything.
I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?

481
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:28,488
- So how are we doing?
- He's right.

482
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,390
Pat, do the math.

483
00:27:30,392 --> 00:27:34,428
- Where are the police?
- It takes a while out here.

484
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,698
- Stay back.
- Just want to make sure that no one else gets hurt

485
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,733
in the meantime.

486
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:42,694
Okay, I gave you the damn gun...

487
00:27:43,405 --> 00:27:45,872
Tiger!

488
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:50,377
- Get him down!
- Justin?

489
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,645
Get him down!

490
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,070
What's happening?

491
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:02,723
Shh!

492
00:28:02,725 --> 00:28:04,258
Justin?

493
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,893
Shouldn't have locked the door.

494
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:08,328
Shit. Sam!

495
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:13,801
Get the bullets!

496
00:28:18,507 --> 00:28:19,923
All right, load the gun.

497
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:21,340
- How's it going in there?
- Not good!

498
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:24,778
Fine, but we would rather
wait for the police!

499
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,313
Justin?

500
00:28:26,315 --> 00:28:27,955
He's fine...

501
00:28:29,485 --> 00:28:30,884
but he's gonna wait too!

502
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,722
Understood, gentlemen.

503
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:37,892
Hold tight.

504
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:41,762
You think they know?

505
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:43,597
I think they're
smarter than you!

506
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,665
Darcy...

507
00:28:45,768 --> 00:28:46,800
Man.

508
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:50,638
I apologize.

509
00:28:53,876 --> 00:28:56,637
We'll do it here.
Stage it up the road. Okay.

510
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:07,387
- Hey, what was that gonzo shit, man?
- So in a tournament,

511
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:11,291
I snap his arm or he taps out
and we all go get burgers.

512
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:12,859
- Snap it.
- Come on.

513
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:14,411
Look, we've got the gun.

514
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:15,962
Why don't we just let him...
Wait, wait. I don't want it.

515
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,631
All right? I don't...
I don't feel good with it.

516
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,932
Who wants it?

517
00:29:18,934 --> 00:29:19,866
- Not me.
- Hm?

518
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:21,735
- No. I can't shoot.
- I can.

519
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,903
No, not you.

520
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:24,838
- Then fucking keep it.
- Keep it, Sam.

521
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,273
I'll take it
when I'm up.

522
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,507
When I let go...

523
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:28,909
what are you gonna do?

524
00:29:30,012 --> 00:29:31,545
Butt-fuck everyone
in the room.

525
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,716
You're gonna sit
criss-cross applesauce.

526
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:37,951
Say it.

527
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:41,088
I'm gonna sit
criss-cross apple sau...

528
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,058
Nice.

529
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,460
Now lean against the chair.

530
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,864
Hey, is there another
way out of here?

531
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:52,099
No.

532
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:56,336
You fed 'em yet today?

533
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:57,604
It doesn't matter.

534
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:59,005
They're professionals.

535
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,774
You might lose
a couple by morning

536
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:01,942
Maybe a bunch.

537
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:03,577
Like I said, they're pros.

538
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:05,445
They earn.

539
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:07,013
You'll be compensated.

540
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,716
Christ. How many people
are on that list?

541
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:15,555
It's 1,200 for a prospect,

542
00:30:15,557 --> 00:30:17,557
two for a bait dog.

543
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,860
No studs, no champs
unless you wanna pay

544
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:21,712
20 grand a head.

545
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:23,563
This might cost you
your livelihood, Clark.

546
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,466
As long as it doesn't
cost me mine, you're covered.

547
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,935
There are gonna be cops,
so clean up the residence.

548
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:31,972
Maybe leave a roach
in an ashtray.

549
00:30:31,974 --> 00:30:35,509
Put Daniel on that door
and bring the van around.

550
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:36,810
Shit.

551
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:38,011
The keys.

552
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,847
They're with them,
I guess.

553
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:42,048
I don't know.
We need them.

554
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,050
I got a ton
of shit to do.

555
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,452
Go on.

556
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:47,687
This is a fire hazard.

557
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,894
I wouldn't put
Daniel on the door.

558
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:56,062
Fine. Plenty to do.

559
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:58,598
Where's Daniel?

560
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,440
He stepped out.
I'm covering.

561
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:03,970
Everything okay?

562
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,946
Meet me
at the utility shed.

563
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,859
This a new ride?

564
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:26,993
Yeah.

565
00:31:26,995 --> 00:31:28,662
Just turning it over.

566
00:31:28,664 --> 00:31:29,796
I think it's getting choked.

567
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:30,764
Wrong filter.

568
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,699
- She's a beaut.
- What's up?

569
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,167
Need some
of the squad.

570
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,635
Red laces only.

571
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:37,537
- Tonight?
- Now.

572
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:38,672
The list.

573
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:42,609
This is everybody
who knows?

574
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,977
Yeah. Including the band.

575
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:45,078
Knows what?

576
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,513
Manageable.

577
00:31:46,515 --> 00:31:49,483
From here on out,
not a single name gets added

578
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:50,951
unless they have red laces.

579
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:52,652
There's 80 people in there.

580
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,588
You plus four.

581
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,691
Give Gabe the keys
in case we have to play valet.

582
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:00,961
We're losing light.

583
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,572
- You got it?
- Yeah.

584
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,169
Whoa, watch out!

585
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:10,570
That could be asbestos.

586
00:32:10,572 --> 00:32:12,639
- It's not asbestos.
- You don't have a phone, do you?

587
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,174
They took it.

588
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:19,212
Hers too.
I'm gonna search her, okay?

589
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:26,653
Careful. That one
could be a live wire.

590
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,455
It's a speaker wire.

591
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:44,004
What'd you find?

592
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:45,446
Uh...

593
00:32:47,976 --> 00:32:49,242
<i>"Fleisch Wolf"?</i>

594
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:51,611
Uh... <i>fleisch</i> means...

595
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:52,946
uh, flesh.

596
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:54,514
Or meat.

597
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:56,116
Like a <i>fleisch</i> salad.
It's German.

598
00:32:56,118 --> 00:32:58,218
So "Meat Wolf"?

599
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,660
Yeah.

600
00:33:02,624 --> 00:33:04,090
This shit's solid.

601
00:33:04,092 --> 00:33:06,012
- Great.
- There's nothing here.

602
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:11,798
Okay. Empty out your pockets.

603
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
Come search me, faggot.

604
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:15,001
Just shoot him.

605
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:17,971
Come on.

606
00:33:19,508 --> 00:33:20,840
Can I get up?

607
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,482
On the chair.

608
00:33:23,812 --> 00:33:25,612
Slowly. Slowly.

609
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,599
Turn 'em out.

610
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,270
Come on, man.
Other one.

611
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:56,209
Oh fuck.

612
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:58,244
Good call.

613
00:33:58,246 --> 00:33:59,913
Turn it out,
for fuck's sake.

614
00:34:01,717 --> 00:34:02,949
What is that?
Give that to me.

615
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:04,851
Hand it over!

616
00:34:04,853 --> 00:34:06,086
Oops.

617
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:07,787
Wait, was that a phone?

618
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:10,223
Oh, shit. Point it... point it at the door.

619
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:12,626
- Point the gun at the door.
- Maybe it's the police. It's a raid.

620
00:34:12,628 --> 00:34:14,294
- Are you serious?
- Shh!

621
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:15,961
- Fuck off, Ilsa!
- Yo, quiet, okay? Justin, don't move.

622
00:34:15,964 --> 00:34:17,297
- Point the gun...
- Nobody move.

623
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:19,132
- Now if we get all behind...
- Nobody talk!

624
00:34:19,134 --> 00:34:20,233
Careful now.

625
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:36,082
Smoke this.

626
00:34:37,853 --> 00:34:39,453
Deal.

627
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:44,090
And if the cherry does
something that you don't like...

628
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:45,692
shoot.

629
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:48,415
Thank you, Amber.

630
00:34:51,733 --> 00:34:53,199
Get comfortable.

631
00:35:02,277 --> 00:35:04,110
Pretty smart for a Nazi.

632
00:35:04,112 --> 00:35:05,792
I'm not a Nazi.

633
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:09,442
How do you fall
for this shit?

634
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:13,353
Let's just say the people who
were gonna hurt me weren't white.

635
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:15,121
Any of them women?

636
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:17,257
It's a problem
where I grew up.

637
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:19,359
- Guys.
- What about tonight?

638
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,094
I think we got a white people
- Reece: Guys! Shh.

639
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:22,736
Oh, fuck you.

640
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,350
It looks like we tripped our main.

641
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:46,953
Our back-up gennie is fired up,
but we're gonna to have to

642
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:49,189
call it a day
and do some troubleshooting.

643
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:51,124
We'll try again on Sunday.

644
00:35:51,126 --> 00:35:52,325
No door charge.

645
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:55,261
Hell, free drinks from 2:00 to 4:00.

646
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:14,080
Those of you attending the racial
advocacy workshop on Wednesday,

647
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,816
assume it's on
unless you hear otherwise.

648
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:18,418
And remember...

649
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,222
this is a movement,
not a party.

650
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:23,389
All right.

651
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,492
Stay safe!
Godspeed.

652
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,429
Who hasn't smoked yet?

653
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:34,881
All right, you guys are
gonna come with me.

654
00:36:52,721 --> 00:36:54,601
You're not
worried they'll talk?

655
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,023
They've got priorities.

656
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:04,464
Tell them the party is on us if
they hole up for a couple of days.

657
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,800
Put this fire out first.

658
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:08,134
Grove Street?

659
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:11,905
My dope nigger stamps
in case one of these meat-heads

660
00:37:11,907 --> 00:37:13,940
gets booked
for possession.

661
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:16,009
All right.

662
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:18,144
Let's get y'all
somewhere safe.

663
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:32,392
Treasure?

664
00:37:32,394 --> 00:37:35,028
Daylight. Underneath.

665
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:39,432
They're moving our gear.

666
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:43,403
- Yes?
- Gentlemen?

667
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,338
We're loading you out.

668
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,307
Are there cops here?

669
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:50,510
They've come and gone.
It got a little complicated.

670
00:37:50,512 --> 00:37:52,545
We're so fucked.

671
00:37:52,547 --> 00:37:55,315
Uh, I'm getting hoarse.

672
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:59,352
Can you hear me
if I speak at this volume?

673
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:00,520
- Yeah.
- Yes.

674
00:38:00,522 --> 00:38:01,888
Good.

675
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,889
Um...

676
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:06,059
and can we please
elect just one voice?

677
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:10,997
Yes.

678
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,033
Okay. Now, you're trapped.

679
00:38:14,035 --> 00:38:15,835
That's not a threat.
It's a fact.

680
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,871
Well, we have a loaded gun.

681
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:19,439
That's also just a fact.

682
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:22,342
Oh, we have plenty
more guns on hand.

683
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:25,011
We just want you out.

684
00:38:25,013 --> 00:38:26,346
Not harmed.

685
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:31,885
Now, the firearm you have
is not registered.

686
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:35,955
I wanted it out of the picture
before the authorities arrived,

687
00:38:35,957 --> 00:38:37,924
but you refused,
so here we are.

688
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:39,292
- Bullshit.
- Yeah.

689
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:41,928
Here we are.

690
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,031
Oh, I do apologize for
my associates. They panicked.

691
00:38:45,033 --> 00:38:47,433
- Yeah, no shit! Man, we're...
- Listen! Listen!

692
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,471
No one is trying
to wipe the slate clean.

693
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:56,910
Whatever you saw or did
is no longer my concern.

694
00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:59,112
You tell whoever you want
whatever you want.

695
00:38:59,114 --> 00:39:03,516
All I ask is that you
understand you were held here

696
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:07,487
for your own safety
before you were released.

697
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:12,926
Okay.

698
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:16,262
Yes. Thank you.

699
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:18,398
But just...

700
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,601
just to be clear...

701
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:23,202
the police are coming back?

702
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,071
They've come and gone.

703
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,573
Well, that's what
concerns us, man!

704
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:30,710
I just want that gun
out of the picture.

705
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:37,383
Okay.

706
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,954
- Careful, man.
- Sorry.

707
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:43,189
- What do we do?
- We dig through the fucking floor.

708
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:44,791
While we just wait?

709
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,392
They could shoot us at any time.
Yeah, but they haven't.

710
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:48,027
How do we even know
that they have guns?

711
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:50,129
They have guns.
No question.

712
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:51,597
We're gonna trust you?

713
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,501
- We've got zero leverage.
- Ask for a phone...

714
00:39:55,503 --> 00:39:58,004
for the gun.
All right.

715
00:39:58,006 --> 00:40:00,640
- What about him?
- Yeah, I mean, the minute we give it up,

716
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:02,962
what if he just, like, attacks?
Then I'll wrap him up.

717
00:40:04,346 --> 00:40:05,278
Okay.

718
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,580
So we see what they think?
Mmhmm.

719
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:11,985
All right.

720
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:17,223
Uh, we'll give you
the gun for a cell phone.

721
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:18,658
Sorry, no.

722
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,495
- Okay, well, how about a registered firearm?
- Funny.

723
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:25,131
Justin, you alive and well?

724
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,633
- I'm alive.
- Okay, good.

725
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:32,472
Gentlemen, I hope
you appreciate the situation.

726
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:36,509
Things have gone south,
no doubt.

727
00:40:36,511 --> 00:40:41,180
But you know if you don't
hand over that gun,

728
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,583
it won't end well.

729
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:45,385
You see...

730
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:49,188
for all I know, I...
I come to my place of business

731
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,224
and there is
an out of town band

732
00:40:51,226 --> 00:40:53,726
locked in a room
with an unregistered firearm.

733
00:40:53,728 --> 00:40:56,295
- Oh, come on!
- And somebody's hurt inside there

734
00:40:56,297 --> 00:40:59,365
and maybe there's
a hostage, too!

735
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:02,235
So what do I do?

736
00:41:03,738 --> 00:41:07,006
Am I within my rights
to intervene?

737
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:09,642
Should I kick down the door
and start shooting?

738
00:41:09,644 --> 00:41:12,345
Or...

739
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:16,649
can we just remove
the guns from the equation?

740
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:18,751
These are my questions.

741
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:21,421
You've got
30 seconds to answer.

742
00:41:21,423 --> 00:41:24,624
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

743
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:27,560
Great. Anyone got
any smart ideas?

744
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:29,462
Justin, get on the floor.

745
00:41:31,499 --> 00:41:34,133
Get on the fuckin' floor
right now. Go.

746
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:39,038
All right. Sam,
come around here.

747
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,574
- Slowly, I want you to take the gun from me.
- Okay.

748
00:41:41,576 --> 00:41:43,456
- You got it?
- Got it.

749
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,778
Okay. Nice and easy.

750
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,081
Play nice,
and I'll be nice.

751
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,449
Please.

752
00:41:49,451 --> 00:41:51,001
Don't do anything.

753
00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:52,552
- This is fuckin' retarded.
- No one's saying it isn't,

754
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,121
but we either hand over the gun
or we open fire with it.

755
00:41:55,123 --> 00:41:58,191
- I vote for that.
- You don't have a vote, okay?

756
00:41:58,193 --> 00:42:00,226
I mean we're taking
chances either way, so...

757
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:01,461
So we're fuckin' dead, guys.

758
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:03,362
At least this way,
we find out

759
00:42:03,364 --> 00:42:05,565
if all we're doing now
is buying time.

760
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,066
- For them.
- Amen.

761
00:42:07,068 --> 00:42:09,235
At this point,
I'm just fucking curious.

762
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:17,543
Okay...
we'll give you the gun.

763
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,380
But we're gonna
keep the ammo.

764
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:23,816
Fine. Safer for everyone.

765
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:27,053
All right, let's move
this fucking couch.

766
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,495
Okay.

767
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:43,469
All right, keep still.

768
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,741
Okay, stand back!

769
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,423
You've got it.

770
00:42:55,083 --> 00:42:56,616
Here we go.

771
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:06,092
May I approach?

772
00:43:06,094 --> 00:43:07,460
No!

773
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:09,462
No. I'm gonna throw it.

774
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:11,898
Careful. It was a gift.

775
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,773
- They're killing us!
- Keep the gun!

776
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,378
Get the fuck off of me!

777
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,813
Okay, okay!

778
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:30,249
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

779
00:43:38,693 --> 00:43:40,560
Fuck you!

780
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:44,163
Oh, my God!

781
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:45,831
Keep it up! Pull it up!

782
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,333
Oh fuck.

783
00:43:49,137 --> 00:43:50,937
Yo, help me
move the couch.

784
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:55,408
Help me move it!

785
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,510
Oh, shit!

786
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:02,582
This will be over soon, gentlemen.

787
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:11,624
I'll fuckin' crush you.

788
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:23,296
Get the box cutter!

789
00:44:25,406 --> 00:44:27,273
Get the fucking box cutter
out of his hand!

790
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:35,815
- Tell me when he's out!
- Okay!

791
00:44:35,817 --> 00:44:37,950
Pat! Pat!

792
00:44:37,952 --> 00:44:39,485
Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

793
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:40,686
Shush! Shush!

794
00:44:40,688 --> 00:44:41,854
Shush!

795
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:45,658
He's out. He's out!

796
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:50,630
Oh, fuck.

797
00:44:50,632 --> 00:44:53,833
Put pressure on it!
Put pressure!

798
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:55,368
I know, I know, I know.

799
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,637
Just breathe.
Breathe. Breathe.

800
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:59,939
He's not out!

801
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:00,973
He's not out!

802
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,444
You got this?

803
00:45:26,301 --> 00:45:28,334
How long does it take...

804
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:31,404
until we know... for sure?

805
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,443
What the...

806
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:38,511
Oh, Jesus.

807
00:45:43,418 --> 00:45:44,750
Oh, Jesus.

808
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:56,495
Any and all firearms,

809
00:45:56,497 --> 00:45:58,698
Clark will handle it
from here on.

810
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,299
He give you an E.T.A.?

811
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,934
You said no calls.

812
00:46:01,936 --> 00:46:03,636
Right. Good.

813
00:46:03,638 --> 00:46:05,304
Phones too.
What happened in there?

814
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:07,106
Set Neal up for tomorrow

815
00:46:07,107 --> 00:46:08,907
New drywall, pour a floor.
Tell him we had a leak.

816
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,310
Door with a frame, too.
What happened?

817
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:13,646
Uh, a bit of
a maelstrom tonight.

818
00:46:13,648 --> 00:46:16,415
Visiting band hurt
one of ours.

819
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:17,650
Who?

820
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:19,352
Emily.

821
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:21,287
Maybe Big Justin, too.

822
00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:22,421
What the fuck
are we doing then?

823
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:24,490
Let's get in there.

824
00:46:24,492 --> 00:46:28,294
We're not coming apart
is what we are doing.

825
00:46:28,296 --> 00:46:33,332
We're saving questions until this
pig fuck is transferred off-site.

826
00:46:33,334 --> 00:46:35,835
Darcy.

827
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:39,905
Okay. Last chance
if anyone needs to take a leak.

828
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,340
I lost the gun.

829
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:16,942
You held on longer
than I would have.

830
00:47:20,915 --> 00:47:22,381
Hey.

831
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:23,916
I'm going.

832
00:47:23,918 --> 00:47:28,020
There's no air shaft,
there's no sewer system...

833
00:47:28,022 --> 00:47:30,456
no nothing.

834
00:47:31,626 --> 00:47:33,266
There it is.

835
00:47:37,665 --> 00:47:38,964
What time is it?

836
00:47:38,966 --> 00:47:40,466
It's not daylight.

837
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:41,967
It's something.

838
00:47:41,969 --> 00:47:43,669
Out the way.

839
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:12,198
Oh, fuck.

840
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:16,235
Look for a door.

841
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:23,256
Just let me know.

842
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:26,546
Hey...

843
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:31,484
I'm sorry
about your friend.

844
00:48:36,657 --> 00:48:38,958
Shit!

845
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:43,696
Okay, move.

846
00:48:43,698 --> 00:48:45,178
Fuck!

847
00:48:57,745 --> 00:48:58,944
Is there a lock?

848
00:48:58,946 --> 00:49:01,847
Other side, maybe.

849
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:03,849
We're burning time.

850
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:05,084
Wait, but...

851
00:49:05,086 --> 00:49:07,119
Look! There's...
there's ventilation!

852
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:08,654
Six inch ducts.
Good luck.

853
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:10,456
Shouldn't we look around more?

854
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,824
We just did!

855
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,159
Go. Go, go. Push.

856
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:23,836
Heroin.

857
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,840
It's not about her or us.

858
00:49:30,645 --> 00:49:32,545
It's a... it's
a big ass bunker.

859
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:34,246
- Give me your hand.
- Big ass dead end.

860
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:35,748
Give it to me.
Hold it up, up, up.

861
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,082
All right. Look away, look away.

862
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:38,584
Maybe we can use this
to our advantage.

863
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:40,186
We're done.

864
00:49:40,922 --> 00:49:43,456
I'm done.

865
00:49:43,457 --> 00:49:45,991
Okay? You can close the door behind
me if you want to strategize.

866
00:49:45,993 --> 00:49:48,694
- We're not ready!
- What do you think they're doing out there?

867
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:50,629
- That's just it. We don't know.
- We fucking know

868
00:49:50,631 --> 00:49:52,031
they mean us harm!

869
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:54,033
It's just that if have guns,

870
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:55,834
okay, why haven't
they mowed us down already?

871
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:57,836
We can't just go missing.

872
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:59,505
They need us found.

873
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:01,273
All right.
Grab some shit

874
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:02,274
and get ready to run.

875
00:50:02,276 --> 00:50:03,642
Then we die.

876
00:50:03,644 --> 00:50:05,744
Yeah, but the longer we wait,

877
00:50:05,746 --> 00:50:07,246
the surer that is.

878
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:10,950
- Tiger, you ready?
- Yeah, almost, man.

879
00:50:10,952 --> 00:50:14,353
We can't take it so seriously.

880
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:20,526
We gotta...

881
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:23,929
treat this like paintball.

882
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:26,765
What?

883
00:50:28,536 --> 00:50:30,135
Rick Silva...

884
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:37,676
helped organize the paintball
for Skate-o's bachelor party.

885
00:50:37,678 --> 00:50:41,914
And we were short a few players
to book the whole field,

886
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:47,586
so they paired us up
with these ex-Marines.

887
00:50:47,588 --> 00:50:51,256
And the first few rounds,
these guys just...

888
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:54,760
tore us to shreds.

889
00:50:54,762 --> 00:50:57,963
I mean, zero casualties
on their side.

890
00:50:57,965 --> 00:51:01,066
And I just cowered
behind these trees

891
00:51:01,068 --> 00:51:03,035
till I got shot.

892
00:51:03,037 --> 00:51:05,337
Covered in paint. But Rick...

893
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,239
Tiger, you done?

894
00:51:09,577 --> 00:51:11,276
Okay.

895
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:12,778
Pat, you're done, too.

896
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,179
I'm sorry, man.
We gotta go.

897
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:15,848
That's okay.

898
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,883
- Was that a pep talk?
- Ready?

899
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:23,856
Now we won't all live, but...

900
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:27,393
I don't know.
Maybe we won't all die.

901
00:51:32,066 --> 00:51:35,634
- Here.
- No, I'm just gonna run.

902
00:51:35,636 --> 00:51:37,196
I got it.

903
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:41,974
All right, fuck it.
Simon and Garfunkel.

904
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:45,911
Desert island band.

905
00:51:48,082 --> 00:51:49,314
Prince.

906
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:53,686
I, uh...

907
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:57,256
- I'm still the Misfits.
- True school, man.

908
00:51:57,258 --> 00:51:58,891
Are we going?

909
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:02,435
Yeah.

910
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:12,871
Madonna and... Slayer.

911
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:17,076
Here we go.

912
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:18,177
Watch it!

913
00:52:21,782 --> 00:52:23,115
What the fuck?

914
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:25,951
They're letting us out.

915
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:27,186
How many exits are there?

916
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:30,089
Uh, the main, the back,
maybe the kitchen.

917
00:52:30,091 --> 00:52:31,423
I always...
What about windows?

918
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:32,858
See for yourselves.

919
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:35,427
Fuck.

920
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:36,762
Quiet.

921
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,200
Oh, shit.

922
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,035
Should we hide?

923
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:45,104
Uh, whatever you want, man.

924
00:52:53,013 --> 00:52:54,747
We... we should split up.

925
00:52:54,749 --> 00:52:56,215
Totally.

926
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:07,259
What the fuck?

927
00:53:07,261 --> 00:53:08,827
Tiger!

928
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:13,966
Tiger!

929
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:19,371
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

930
00:53:24,178 --> 00:53:25,344
Shit.

931
00:53:29,316 --> 00:53:30,916
Oh, shit!

932
00:53:34,488 --> 00:53:36,388
Save it.

933
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,457
Oh, shit.

934
00:54:15,996 --> 00:54:17,896
<i>Fass! Fass!</i>

935
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,500
<i>Voran! Fass!</i>

936
00:54:21,502 --> 00:54:22,835
<i>Fass!</i>

937
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,512
Hey.

938
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:24,396
They're everywhere!

939
00:55:24,398 --> 00:55:26,198
Where's Reece?

940
00:55:28,502 --> 00:55:30,022
It's us.

941
00:55:35,876 --> 00:55:38,010
Come on. Move.

942
00:55:40,214 --> 00:55:41,446
Sam, look.

943
00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:46,551
<i>Fleisch Wolf.</i>

944
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,287
It's a song.

945
00:55:49,857 --> 00:55:51,590
It means "Meat Grinder."

946
00:55:53,494 --> 00:55:55,594
Up! Up!

947
00:55:55,596 --> 00:55:57,562
<i>So ist's brav.</i>

948
00:55:57,564 --> 00:55:59,064
<i>So ist's brav.</i>

949
00:55:59,066 --> 00:56:00,899
You're retiring him?

950
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:02,935
He's worked up.

951
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:04,202
Send in another.

952
00:56:04,204 --> 00:56:05,304
Send two.
Finish it.

953
00:56:05,306 --> 00:56:07,406
Kill that feedback first.

954
00:56:07,408 --> 00:56:10,642
And if I send in two fight dogs,
what do you think they'll do?

955
00:56:10,644 --> 00:56:12,611
Send me in there.
I'll finish up.

956
00:56:12,613 --> 00:56:14,212
Just give me the rules.

957
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:15,580
All right.

958
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:19,451
Blades only.

959
00:56:19,453 --> 00:56:21,453
Sloppy is fine.

960
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:22,487
Try not to hit the bone.

961
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:24,222
Okay.

962
00:56:24,224 --> 00:56:25,891
Take Jonathan.

963
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:27,259
Brute squad.

964
00:56:27,261 --> 00:56:29,141
Keep him caged
until we tag out.

965
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,666
He breathing?

966
00:56:41,342 --> 00:56:43,175
A little bit, yeah.

967
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:45,410
Let him bleed.

968
00:56:45,412 --> 00:56:48,347
Later is better
for time of death.

969
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:49,448
Keys?

970
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,416
No.

971
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:25,484
They're coming.

972
00:57:28,022 --> 00:57:29,554
I can't do this.

973
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:37,562
Get back!

974
00:57:37,564 --> 00:57:39,698
No!

975
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,166
Where's Emily?

976
00:57:47,274 --> 00:57:49,674
What the fuck
are you doing?

977
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,143
Hey!

978
00:57:53,547 --> 00:57:55,147
Which one did it?

979
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:56,648
- Werm did it.
- Bullshit.

980
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,749
Which one?

981
00:57:57,751 --> 00:57:59,651
What did they tell you?

982
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:03,522
What? You want to know?

983
00:58:03,524 --> 00:58:06,224
You want him to know?

984
00:58:06,226 --> 00:58:07,626
Know what?

985
00:58:07,628 --> 00:58:11,396
Werm found out
that she was leaving...

986
00:58:11,398 --> 00:58:14,466
but she didn't say
that it was with you.

987
00:58:16,336 --> 00:58:17,769
"Meat Grinder."

988
00:58:19,673 --> 00:58:22,607
That song was their cue.

989
00:58:24,178 --> 00:58:25,544
You should go.

990
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:36,889
Here we go.

991
00:58:38,158 --> 00:58:39,724
This is taking too long.

992
00:58:42,162 --> 00:58:43,495
Gabe?

993
00:58:45,632 --> 00:58:48,733
You didn't want Daniel
on door duty.

994
00:58:48,735 --> 00:58:50,202
Why?

995
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:54,739
Nothing concrete, he and...

996
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:56,675
and Emily...

997
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:29,374
Little lovebirds.

998
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:52,230
Recognize this?

999
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:55,133
No, sir.

1000
00:59:55,135 --> 00:59:56,835
Of course not.
You were still handing out

1001
00:59:56,837 --> 00:59:59,371
leaflets when these boys
made their bones.

1002
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:01,239
It's from last Easter.

1003
01:00:01,241 --> 01:00:04,709
Supposed to disappear
after the boot party.

1004
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:07,579
He just started talking.

1005
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:09,347
Amber's alive
saying Werm did it.

1006
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:10,448
Never mind that.

1007
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,417
You...

1008
01:00:14,588 --> 01:00:18,456
Werm saved us all.

1009
01:00:25,866 --> 01:00:27,566
Sam?

1010
01:00:30,437 --> 01:00:32,470
It's okay.

1011
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:36,141
I mean,
it's not okay.

1012
01:00:36,143 --> 01:00:38,643
- You didn't know either?
- He's with us.

1013
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:39,744
Not where.

1014
01:00:39,746 --> 01:00:41,386
We gotta split.

1015
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:48,653
This has a wider duct, I think.

1016
01:00:48,655 --> 01:00:51,590
We're not gonna
fit through there.

1017
01:00:51,592 --> 01:00:53,291
Oh!

1018
01:00:53,293 --> 01:00:55,794
Daniel, um, he can help.

1019
01:00:55,796 --> 01:00:57,195
Why?

1020
01:00:57,197 --> 01:00:58,797
Who's he?

1021
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,700
A traitor. If they don't
already know, they know now.

1022
01:01:01,702 --> 01:01:03,401
I can get us out of here.

1023
01:01:03,403 --> 01:01:05,337
Wow. A conspiracy.

1024
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,339
No, just a cluster-fuck.

1025
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:17,349
There is still blades
and fangs for the visitors,

1026
01:01:17,351 --> 01:01:19,451
but we are getting
lean on time.

1027
01:01:19,453 --> 01:01:22,520
Now, if you have
to shoot, shoot once.

1028
01:01:22,522 --> 01:01:24,756
If more than once,
keep it a tight grouping

1029
01:01:24,758 --> 01:01:27,192
'cause you'll be digging
the slugs out yourself.

1030
01:01:27,194 --> 01:01:29,154
As for Daniel and Amber,
they can...

1031
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:36,034
What did we forget?

1032
01:01:45,812 --> 01:01:48,780
There's a river on two sides.
The quarry's on another.

1033
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:51,916
We can parallel the main road back,
go for help.

1034
01:01:51,918 --> 01:01:53,918
Well, how do we get
past the door?

1035
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,654
I know something you don't.

1036
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:57,455
Good. What?

1037
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:59,291
I know where we keep...

1038
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:02,427
Too slow.

1039
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:38,930
Should we go?

1040
01:02:38,932 --> 01:02:40,432
Now?

1041
01:02:40,434 --> 01:02:41,900
We have the gun.

1042
01:02:41,902 --> 01:02:43,768
I guess.

1043
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:45,303
Yes.

1044
01:02:45,305 --> 01:02:46,671
Yes!

1045
01:02:46,673 --> 01:02:48,773
Give me two.

1046
01:03:11,298 --> 01:03:13,298
Easy! Not her!

1047
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,899
Don't fire!

1048
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:16,000
<i>Fass! Fass!</i>

1049
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:17,035
<i>Fass!</i>

1050
01:03:18,605 --> 01:03:19,738
Go!

1051
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:20,872
Sam!

1052
01:03:21,975 --> 01:03:23,041
Sam!

1053
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:34,753
We're never getting out.

1054
01:03:40,093 --> 01:03:41,593
Fuck.

1055
01:04:03,683 --> 01:04:05,950
You know, I'm lucky.

1056
01:04:05,952 --> 01:04:09,120
I guessed at least
they were gonna shoot me.

1057
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:21,833
Three'll do, gentlemen.

1058
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:23,401
The fourth can disappear.

1059
01:04:23,403 --> 01:04:24,836
It's time to start
the clean-up.

1060
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:27,405
I'm gonna need
a push broom.

1061
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:30,375
This is supposed to
have happened already.

1062
01:04:30,377 --> 01:04:32,217
- Time to sprint.
- Yes, sir.

1063
01:04:33,513 --> 01:04:35,113
Well done.

1064
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:37,215
Thank him.

1065
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:43,154
Nearly got away
from me. Us.

1066
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:51,129
Shouldn't we be panicking?

1067
01:04:55,402 --> 01:04:57,101
I'm hungry.

1068
01:05:04,611 --> 01:05:07,712
I can't die here with you.

1069
01:05:09,449 --> 01:05:11,115
So don't.

1070
01:05:13,186 --> 01:05:16,721
You know, feel free just to...

1071
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:23,628
Hey, I want the rest
of your pep talk.

1072
01:05:25,131 --> 01:05:27,866
Oh, no.
It no longer applies.

1073
01:05:27,868 --> 01:05:30,134
Oh, come on.

1074
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:32,237
I'm curious.

1075
01:05:33,673 --> 01:05:36,708
It was paintballing...

1076
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,043
you were cowering...

1077
01:05:41,915 --> 01:05:44,048
Yeah, Rick Silva.

1078
01:05:45,986 --> 01:05:51,689
We were getting slaughtered
by these legit Iraq vets.

1079
01:05:51,691 --> 01:05:53,558
It totally applies.

1080
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,863
Full camo, thousand-dollar
automatic paintball guns.

1081
01:06:00,467 --> 01:06:05,737
They knew real war
and they played real war.

1082
01:06:05,739 --> 01:06:10,975
Tactics, hand signals, flanking.

1083
01:06:10,977 --> 01:06:15,013
Just wiped us all out.

1084
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:22,153
So Rick gets fed up
and says, "Fuck it."

1085
01:06:22,155 --> 01:06:25,690
Didn't care
about getting shot.

1086
01:06:25,692 --> 01:06:28,760
Didn't care about taking cover.

1087
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:31,796
It was hopeless, man.

1088
01:06:34,267 --> 01:06:39,837
So the last match,
the whistle blows,

1089
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,008
and he just
tears out there,

1090
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:50,748
full jackass, in...
in sneakers and cut-offs

1091
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:55,119
and he... wipes out
their whole team.

1092
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,524
Doesn't stop.

1093
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:05,897
Just keeps running
and laughing and shooting...

1094
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:10,668
until they're all dead.

1095
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:16,140
Pretend dead.

1096
01:07:17,577 --> 01:07:20,745
And we're up
against real guns.

1097
01:07:20,747 --> 01:07:22,180
Yeah.

1098
01:07:24,651 --> 01:07:29,120
Either way,
we can't play real war.

1099
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:57,215
Let's pretend.

1100
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:15,400
For you.

1101
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:19,737
We're just mopping up tonight.

1102
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:21,673
You already earned these.

1103
01:08:25,278 --> 01:08:28,279
Maybe push Neal,
depending on the mess,

1104
01:08:28,281 --> 01:08:30,181
to start looking
for a new house band.

1105
01:08:30,183 --> 01:08:32,950
We've really gotta get
back to a routine.

1106
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:34,919
You think Cowcatcher's
gonna talk?

1107
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:37,789
I'm more worried
about their habits.

1108
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:41,359
Really have to stay away
from that nigger dope.

1109
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:44,362
There's a bad batch
doing the rounds.

1110
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:55,173
We're good to go.

1111
01:08:58,278 --> 01:09:00,879
We're set.

1112
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,840
This all hinges on nothing
having happened here.

1113
01:09:06,019 --> 01:09:07,059
Now, let's be clear.

1114
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:12,423
This should keep him alive
for another hour.

1115
01:09:12,425 --> 01:09:14,692
I would consider it
a personal favor

1116
01:09:14,694 --> 01:09:16,614
if he dies with meat
in his teeth.

1117
01:09:18,965 --> 01:09:21,199
Come on. Come on.

1118
01:09:24,304 --> 01:09:25,970
Bite command is <i>"fass."</i>

1119
01:09:27,407 --> 01:09:29,040
It's all you'll need.

1120
01:09:36,249 --> 01:09:39,717
Disregard. Just shoot
who is left.

1121
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,452
They don't have to
be accounted for.

1122
01:09:41,454 --> 01:09:44,088
Forensics is
no longer a concern.

1123
01:09:45,959 --> 01:09:49,127
We call this in late,
all is for naught.

1124
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,700
You guys got
any 12 gauge?

1125
01:09:55,702 --> 01:09:57,769
Not in the office.
Try the bar.

1126
01:09:57,771 --> 01:09:59,904
- How many shots you have left?
- Three.

1127
01:09:59,906 --> 01:10:01,105
So you have one extra.

1128
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:16,988
No shells.

1129
01:10:20,426 --> 01:10:23,187
Behind the bar.
Better get started.

1130
01:10:36,276 --> 01:10:37,809
Shit!

1131
01:10:39,112 --> 01:10:40,792
Easy! Easy!

1132
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:44,282
Easy!

1133
01:10:44,284 --> 01:10:46,084
No buckshot!

1134
01:11:07,373 --> 01:11:08,773
What's happening?

1135
01:11:08,775 --> 01:11:10,808
Dog freaked.
And turn this shit off!

1136
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:12,510
I tried! It's not coming
from our mixer.

1137
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:14,145
Go! We got this.

1138
01:11:14,147 --> 01:11:16,914
And don't tell Darcy.
Or Clark.

1139
01:11:20,787 --> 01:11:22,347
We going?
Yeah.

1140
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:26,240
Hey!

1141
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:28,291
Down there, you dip-shit fashion
punk clown motherfuckers!

1142
01:11:28,294 --> 01:11:29,861
- Turn around!
<i>- Shazbot!</i>

1143
01:11:29,863 --> 01:11:31,896
What? What...
Who is that?

1144
01:11:31,898 --> 01:11:33,898
Odin himself.

1145
01:12:01,194 --> 01:12:02,560
Give me the shotgun.

1146
01:12:02,562 --> 01:12:04,061
No, I got the shotgun.

1147
01:12:04,063 --> 01:12:06,497
Then you go down
this fucking hole.

1148
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:10,167
Three shots?

1149
01:12:10,169 --> 01:12:12,153
Yeah.

1150
01:12:12,154 --> 01:12:14,138
You hear me fire twice,
you come down no matter what.

1151
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:16,140
- This is a trap.
- Yeah, no shit.

1152
01:12:16,142 --> 01:12:17,408
You wanna go tell Darcy?

1153
01:12:22,882 --> 01:12:24,582
He's gonna be pissed.

1154
01:12:28,354 --> 01:12:30,221
Watch my back.

1155
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:57,014
Fuck this.

1156
01:12:59,185 --> 01:13:00,618
Get Gabe, man!

1157
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:02,386
We need two down here
and one up there.

1158
01:13:02,388 --> 01:13:05,122
Who's got the nine?
I think Alan does, but I'm not sure-

1159
01:13:05,124 --> 01:13:07,625
Oh, fuck! Block it!

1160
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:10,809
Pat!

1161
01:13:11,998 --> 01:13:13,464
He's got three shots left!

1162
01:13:13,466 --> 01:13:14,999
Bitch.

1163
01:13:25,378 --> 01:13:27,078
Gabe!

1164
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,287
Amber!

1165
01:13:36,289 --> 01:13:37,555
Yeah?

1166
01:13:37,557 --> 01:13:39,357
Uh...

1167
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:42,026
never mind!

1168
01:13:50,403 --> 01:13:52,136
Two shots left!

1169
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,114
Nice fuckin' try!

1170
01:14:05,418 --> 01:14:07,118
Go fuck yourself!

1171
01:14:13,326 --> 01:14:15,526
Shit. Shit.

1172
01:14:40,119 --> 01:14:41,352
Oh, shit!

1173
01:14:43,723 --> 01:14:44,755
Pat!

1174
01:14:44,757 --> 01:14:46,557
One shot left!

1175
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:54,131
Fuck.

1176
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:03,307
Zero.

1177
01:15:10,483 --> 01:15:11,483
Oh, shit!

1178
01:15:17,457 --> 01:15:18,823
Get off of me!

1179
01:15:56,095 --> 01:15:57,428
Got him.

1180
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:00,831
Totally.

1181
01:16:03,169 --> 01:16:05,736
Flabbergasted that motherfucker.

1182
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:28,259
If I had any idea...

1183
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,806
Anymore dogs?

1184
01:16:37,103 --> 01:16:38,802
People?

1185
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:40,437
No. Not here.

1186
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:43,641
They're... up the road.

1187
01:16:56,856 --> 01:16:58,589
I don't want to go to jail.

1188
01:17:36,862 --> 01:17:39,930
Does anyone know
how to hotwire a car?

1189
01:17:39,932 --> 01:17:41,298
No.

1190
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,634
I'd stay off
the road anyway.

1191
01:18:00,786 --> 01:18:02,453
Are you gonna shoot me?

1192
01:18:03,756 --> 01:18:05,422
Where's Werm?

1193
01:18:06,559 --> 01:18:09,493
- We sent him home...
- Stay quiet till we're out.

1194
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:35,492
It's the residents.

1195
01:18:36,856 --> 01:18:38,289
What are they doing?

1196
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:40,691
Something you don't
want to see.

1197
01:18:42,862 --> 01:18:45,663
We can call the cops
when we get to the orchard.

1198
01:18:50,336 --> 01:18:52,436
Did you see them die?

1199
01:18:53,906 --> 01:18:55,939
Two.

1200
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:57,574
Not the third.

1201
01:19:01,614 --> 01:19:03,781
I think I'm going.

1202
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:07,651
You can call the cops
when you get there.

1203
01:19:07,653 --> 01:19:10,521
If you disappear,
I'll find you.

1204
01:19:10,523 --> 01:19:11,789
I will.

1205
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:17,961
I promise.

1206
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:21,932
You should go, too.

1207
01:19:23,369 --> 01:19:25,102
Just hedge our bets.

1208
01:19:26,605 --> 01:19:29,473
You got three rounds...

1209
01:19:29,475 --> 01:19:32,376
and I've seen
you pump a shotgun.

1210
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:34,578
Fair enough.

1211
01:19:49,929 --> 01:19:51,528
Do you believe him?

1212
01:19:52,965 --> 01:19:55,065
Shh.

1213
01:20:07,513 --> 01:20:08,946
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

1214
01:20:12,051 --> 01:20:13,083
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

1215
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:21,024
<i>Nimm futter!</i>

1216
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,993
<i>Nimm futter!
Nimm futter!</i>

1217
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:25,829
- Jesus.
<i>- Nimm futter!</i>

1218
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:29,466
That ought to be enough.

1219
01:20:29,468 --> 01:20:31,502
<i>Lass es! Lass es!</i>

1220
01:20:31,504 --> 01:20:32,736
<i>Lass es!</i>

1221
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:34,905
<i>So ist's brav.</i>

1222
01:20:34,907 --> 01:20:36,173
<i>Aus. Aus.</i>

1223
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,579
Wipe it down!

1224
01:20:45,851 --> 01:20:47,718
Do you think they'd
leave the engine on?

1225
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,788
Yeah. It'll run
the gauge down too.

1226
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:52,990
Let's call this in.

1227
01:20:55,494 --> 01:20:57,027
<i>Aus. Aus.</i>

1228
01:20:57,029 --> 01:20:58,429
You got the dog?

1229
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:00,899
I got the dog.

1230
01:21:04,937 --> 01:21:06,503
Tie him up.

1231
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,107
Give me your gun.

1232
01:21:10,109 --> 01:21:11,875
I don't have one.

1233
01:21:11,877 --> 01:21:14,678
I'll shoot you either way
if you don't hand me one.

1234
01:21:22,021 --> 01:21:23,220
Throw it.

1235
01:22:40,232 --> 01:22:41,965
They're making it our fault.

1236
01:22:44,236 --> 01:22:46,904
You were trespassing.

1237
01:22:53,779 --> 01:22:56,013
It looks fishy to me.

1238
01:22:56,015 --> 01:22:58,582
The cloth is
to make it seal.

1239
01:22:58,584 --> 01:23:00,284
I wouldn't do it like that.

1240
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:02,719
They got my gun.

1241
01:23:02,721 --> 01:23:04,481
- Shut up.
- Listen...

1242
01:23:19,505 --> 01:23:21,805
So we're doing that?

1243
01:23:21,807 --> 01:23:24,141
Why else would
we walk up here?

1244
01:23:26,645 --> 01:23:29,245
I don't know.
And I was gonna...

1245
01:23:30,616 --> 01:23:32,583
ruin the crime scene.

1246
01:23:33,986 --> 01:23:35,018
Oh.

1247
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:37,854
I thought we'd leave a new one.

1248
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:55,038
This...

1249
01:23:56,642 --> 01:23:58,308
is a nightmare.

1250
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:01,345
For us all.

1251
01:24:02,815 --> 01:24:07,150
Tell me those stupid fucking
words are his last.

1252
01:24:15,661 --> 01:24:17,227
Do you have a phone?

1253
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,100
It's funny.

1254
01:24:24,803 --> 01:24:27,070
You were so scary at night.

1255
01:25:34,306 --> 01:25:36,940
We need the police.

1256
01:25:57,763 --> 01:25:59,830
<i>Okay, I'm the Ain't Rights
from Washington, D.C.</i>

1257
01:25:59,832 --> 01:26:01,698
<i>Uh, technically, we're
from Arlington.</i>

1258
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:05,068
<i>Nice. Uh, and this is
for Seaside HCFM.</i>

1259
01:26:11,076 --> 01:26:12,442
<i>Yeah, if we can afford it.</i>

1260
01:26:12,444 --> 01:26:14,911
<i>Yeah, no, I really dig
the analogue style.</i>

1261
01:26:14,913 --> 01:26:17,414
<i>Uh, which brings me to the fact
that you guys are hard to find.</i>

1262
01:27:09,835 --> 01:27:11,368
I know what it is.

1263
01:27:15,507 --> 01:27:17,407
What what is?

1264
01:27:22,514 --> 01:27:25,148
