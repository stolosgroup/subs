00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,081
<i>They called it
"The car for Everyman".</i>

3
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,017
<i>Henry Ford himself called it
a car for the "great multitude."</i>

4
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,464
<i>It was functional and simple,</i>

5
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:41,926
<i>like your sewing machine
or your cast-iron stove.</i>

6
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,799
<i>You could learn to drive it
in less than a day,</i>

7
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:52,573
<i>and you could get any color
you wanted, so long as it was black.</i>

8
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,616
<i>When Ford first conceived the Model T,
it took 13 hours to assemble.</i>

9
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,888
<i>Within five years, he was
turning out a vehicle every 90 seconds.</i>

10
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,090
<i>Of course,
the real invention wasn't the car,</i>

11
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:13,724
<i>it was the assembly line that built it.</i>

12
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:20,296
<i>Pretty soon, other businesses
had borrowed the same techniques.</i>

13
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,501
<i>Seamstresses became button sewers.</i>

14
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:27,444
<i>Furniture makers
became knob turners.</i>

15
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,416
<i>It was the beginning and the end
of imagination...</i>

16
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,918
<i>all at the same time.</i>

17
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,534
<i>Howard?</i>

18
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,665
- Charles, I'm talking to you.
- Hmm?

19
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,719
They need spokes,
same as the others.

20
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,199
You know,
they oughta make a better spoke.

21
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,905
Yeah? Then what would you do?

22
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,305
<i>It was a land of opportunity.</i>

23
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,352
<i>The country was shrinking,</i>

24
00:04:32,452 --> 00:04:35,034
<i>and there was life to be made out West...</i>

25
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,703
<i>for any man with drive
and ambition.</i>

26
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,908
<i>If your dream was big enough
and you had the guts to follow it,</i>

27
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,816
<i>there was truly a fortune
to be made.</i>

28
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:58,192
How are you, sir?

29
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,411
- Damn thing blew on me.
- What?

30
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,472
It's a Stanley Steamer.
The boiler blew.

31
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,542
- Oh?
- Can you fix it?

32
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,986
Uh...

33
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,393
Sure!
Sure I can fix it.

34
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,297
<i>This is an amazing machine.</i>

35
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,766
It's got a two-stroke boiler system...

36
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,604
that's heated
by this huge fire grate.

37
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,571
I mean, it's...

38
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:50,571
Well, it's basically
a very small locomotive.

39
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:53,305
- Thank you.
- Now, I made some improvements.

40
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,112
It wasn't your boiler that was blowing;
it was your bleed valve.

41
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,774
So, with increased pressure, I can see
you getting up to 40 miles an hour.

42
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,770
Really?

43
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:04,619
Oh, yeah and if you superheat the excess,
I can see you reaching...

44
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,624
- 50, maybe 60 miles an hour.
- Is that right?

45
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,926
Easily. And the thing of it is,
Mr. Coughlin, you don't feed it,

46
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,230
you don't stable it,

47
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,163
and unless you hit a lamppost, the thing's
not gonna get sick and die on ya.

48
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:21,172
- That's funny.
- To tell you the truth,

49
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,540
I wouldn't spend more than five dollars
on the best horse in America.

50
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:11,720
<i>This is not the finish line, my friends.
This is the start of the race.</i>

51
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,958
The future is the finish line!

52
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:17,426
And the new Buick White Streak
is just the car to take us there!

53
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:21,133
Four in-line cylinders,
42 1/2 horsepower,

54
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,700
And this is the very same car

55
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:26,968
that you can buy at anyone of our
five showrooms all across the Bay Area.

56
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,306
"The age of the automobile is here,"
boasted Howard. "The future has arrived."

57
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,246
<i>- Oh, my.
- Read the part about the future again.</i>

58
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,350
Oh, I'm kind of dealing
with it right now.

59
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:44,119
Oh, sorry.
Here. I'll take him.

60
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,250
Come here, big guy.
Come here. Come here.

61
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,887
Oh, are you the future, huh?
Are you the future?

62
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:54,162
Are you gonna...

63
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,269
Are you going to the moon?

64
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,328
The moon! Whee!

65
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,139
I'll take it.

66
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,878
Do we really need all this?

67
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,845
No. No. We don't need it...

68
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,362
There's also a caretaker's house,
a paddock, a barn,

69
00:09:11,462 --> 00:09:13,709
some very nice stables.

70
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,977
How big are the stables?

71
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:51,490
Got it.

72
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,052
Settle down. Settle down.

73
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,494
Quit. Quit. Whoa. Whoa.

74
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:02,330
Whoa.

75
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,632
<i>Whoa.</i>

76
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,558
Come on, Dad.

77
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,327
Whoa.

78
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,080
There you go.

79
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:02,423
<i>You're not getting him a horse.</i>

80
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,396
Why not?
He's great at it.

81
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:09,166
<i>- Because he's 16 years old.
- So?</i>

82
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,233
So... he should earn it.

83
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,573
All right.

84
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:22,239
- All... All right. Quiet.
- Everybody knows it.

85
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,782
<i>Nobody knows Longfellow.
Dickinson.</i>

86
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,375
Ooh!

87
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,218
"We never know how high we are..."

88
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,091
<i>Oh, I know that.
Yeah. I know.</i>

89
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,653
I know it.
Well?

90
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,763
"We never know how high we are
till we are called to rise."

91
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,306
- Good.
- Very good, John.

92
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,400
"And then, if we are true to plan,
our statures touch the skies."

93
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,277
<i>- Excellent.
- Yes! That's really good.</i>

94
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,948
Uh-oh.

95
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,989
<i>- "The heroism..."
- Right.</i>

96
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,618
Right. "The heroism..."

97
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,822
"The heroism we recite...

98
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,661
"would be a daily thing,

99
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:19,865
Oh, that's it.
"Did not ourselves the cubits warp,

100
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:23,966
<i>for fear to be a king. "</i>

101
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,011
You should be riding it.
You knew the poem.

102
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:38,717
Yeah. But he looks so perfect out there,
doesn't he?

103
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,124
<i>Yeah. He does.</i>

104
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,630
That's the poetry
right there, Agnes.

105
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:48,064
That's the poetry.

106
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,004
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

107
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,007
I came here 15 years ago
with 21 cents in my pocket.

108
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,976
I know a lot of us at the table
have a story like that.

109
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,172
<i>And, you know,
I can't help thinking...</i>

110
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,517
that if we can start out there
and end up here,

111
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:07,686
where can't we go in America?

112
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:08,987
Hmm...

113
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:13,521
So, as corny as it sounds,
I'd like to propose a toast to the future.

114
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,962
Because out here, my friends,
the sky is literally the limit.

115
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,022
To the future!
To the future!

116
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,036
<i>To the future!</i>

117
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,558
<i>There were no suicides
on Wall Street that day.</i>

118
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,463
<i>It was a myth
that would grow over time.</i>

119
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:02,201
<i>The real effect of October 29
took a little longer to sink in.</i>

120
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,146
<i>By noon, all the gains of
the previous year had been obliterated.</i>

121
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:15,813
<i>By 4:00 p.m., nearly $ 10 billion
of market value was gone.</i>

122
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:23,088
<i>Over the next two weeks,
the hemorrhage continued.</i>

123
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:30,263
<i>And before long,
25% of the workforce was unemployed.</i>

124
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:39,406
<i>A great national migration began.</i>

125
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:43,107
<i>Displaced families
took to the American highway...</i>

126
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:46,549
<i>in the last possession
that remained to them:</i>

127
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,588
<i>Their automobile.</i>

128
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:55,052
<i>And all at once,
millions of Americans...</i>

129
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,927
<i>had a new definition of home.</i>

130
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,348
<i>I made two dollars today.</i>

131
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,954
- What?
- I made two dollars.

132
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,829
Here.

133
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,906
Where did you get these?

134
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,728
Yeah, your boy combed 'em out,
changed all the tack.

135
00:15:47,758 --> 00:15:48,872
I didn't have to tell him a thing.

136
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,683
- Hey, Red,
- Attaboy!

137
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,746
Where'd a young fella
like you learn so much about horses?

138
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,055
His name's Johnny.

139
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,186
You can call me Red.

140
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,262
Whoo!

141
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,342
Yeah! Whoo! Yeah!

142
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:57,648
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

143
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,617
What's that?
Everything.

144
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,321
Dickens, Wordsworth.

145
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:14,045
<i>There's your Arabian Nights
and Moby Dick,</i>

146
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,595
<i>even your Milne, from when you were...</i>

147
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:19,059
Why?
What's wrong?

148
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:23,368
Mr. Blodget here, he has a house,
a real house. - Dad... Dad, what's wrong?

149
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,569
- And his wife cooks.
- She is a good cook.

150
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,273
There's even a phone next door.
We'll call you.

151
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,976
Every couple of weeks, we'll call you,
and we'll tell you where we are.

152
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,433
We're just gonna go home,
all right? Let's go.

153
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:35,316
Listen to me.

154
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,619
You have a gift.
You have a gift.

155
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:44,060
Don't... Don't do this.

156
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,321
- Dad, don't do this.
- We'll be back.

157
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,605
- Mom
- Go with Mr. Blodget.

158
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,000
- No.
- He's gonna take care of you, sweetie.

159
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:05,276
- Mom, don't do this.
- OK, go with him.

160
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,041
I don't know. You still
look pretty tall to be a jockey.

161
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,877
I've never been over 115.

162
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,429
Where'd you learn to ride like that?

163
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,009
Home.

164
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,581
All right.
Here's the way it works.

165
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:48,217
I pay you $10 a week to ride.
You owe nine dollars for your meals,

166
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,285
six dollars to sleep in the stalls,
three dollar tack fee.

167
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,594
That's the deal.
How do I pay all that back?

168
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,827
You win.

169
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,928
<i>Ow!</i>

170
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,837
<i>You son of a bitch!
Get off of me!</i>

171
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,992
Yah!

172
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,405
Get lost!

173
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,958
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

174
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Get off of me!

175
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,479
<i>A nose? You lose a race a nose,
you'd better fall off tryin!</i>

176
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,917
Here. Muck these stalls down,
every damn one of'em!

177
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,978
A nose!
For Christ's sake!

178
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,995
No. No, Bill, I'm not gonna do it.
No more layoffs.

179
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,035
Well, it can't get any worse.

180
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:41,198
<i>Look, if it stays like this,
we'll just...</i>

181
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:46,233
Bill, we'll be fine, really.
We will.

182
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,611
All right. I'll see you in town.

183
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:01,354
Frankie, come on.
It's a glorious day outside.

184
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,759
Why don't...
Why don't you go fishing or something?

185
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,192
I'm reading.

186
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,697
You can read when it's raining.

187
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:10,031
Come on,
I'll teach you to drive the truck.

188
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,629
You already taught me
to drive the truck.

189
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,697
<i>- Well, what are you reading?
- Flash Gordon.</i>

190
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:21,838
Come on, Dad.
It's about the future!

191
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,512
We'll be in San Francisco
till Wednesday.

192
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,297
Yeah? What?

193
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:11,642
<i>Come inside.
- I'm not done.</i>

194
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,201
<i>Sam can do that.</i>

195
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,342
I don't want Sam to do it.
I want to do it.

196
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:24,219
- Annie.
- Don... Don... No!

197
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,858
Ma'am.

198
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,646
Come on, Red!
Come on!

199
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,367
<i>At a time when the world
really needed a drink,</i>

200
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,570
<i>you couldn't get one
in the United States of America.</i>

201
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,046
<i>Liquor was illegal.
Diversions were scarce,</i>

202
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:34,017
<i>and there's just so much
a human being can do without.</i>

203
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,120
<i>Soon, the border town was born,</i>

204
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,520
<i>providing everything to the south</i>

205
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,828
<i>that their neighbor to the north,
would not.</i>

206
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:49,492
<i>You could find anything:
Food, companionship,</i>

207
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:55,005
<i>decent gin,
and with gambling outlawed as well,</i>

208
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,373
<i>the chance to turn bad luck into good.</i>

209
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,482
Relax! You got it!
You got it! You got it!

210
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,214
Go!

211
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,717
That jockey was ridin'
like he's got an anvil in his pocket.

212
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:18,088
I'm gonna bet with you no more.
I don't like it.

213
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,062
Who's that?

214
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,105
George Woolf,
greatest jockey in the world.

215
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,609
<i>That's Charles Howard?
Yeah.</i>

216
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,748
- I thought he came down here for a...
- Quickie divorce?

217
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:51,353
<i>- Why?
Look at him.</i>

218
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,259
Nothing quick about that.

219
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,982
<i>It was in the palace
of the great sultan.</i>

220
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:23,994
<i>Sultan of where?
The Sultan of Araby.</i>

221
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,560
I'd been living there
for almost a year,

222
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,159
racing his Arabians
across the desert by day...

223
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,829
and finishing my personal history
of the region by night.

224
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:38,672
Then one day, the sultan
summons me into his throne room.

225
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,769
He looks at me and says,

226
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,226
- John Pollard.
- John Pollard.

227
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,907
You are my greatest jockey.

228
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:49,518
It is you I have chosen
to ride my hundred mile race

229
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:52,052
from Kusmat to Tripoli.

230
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,725
200 mile.

231
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,661
All right. 200-mile.
Excuse me, sahib.

232
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,533
You didn't need to wreck it, Georgie.

233
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:06,233
When you started tellin' that story,
it was only 50 miles.

234
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,799
Yeah, well,
everything gets longer in the retellin'.

235
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,532
Just ask your friend Wanda over there.

236
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:15,261
You know, if you start ridin'
a little more and talkin' a little less,

237
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:17,211
you might start winnin' some races.

238
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,282
<i>I got two bucks
says I beat you in this one.</i>

239
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,283
<i>I'm not sure if you do,</i>

240
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,163
<i>but I got five says I beat you.</i>

241
00:30:22,263 --> 00:30:22,876
<i>Done.</i>

242
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,861
- Give me odds. You're the favorite.
- Even money.

243
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:34,092
- Nah! Forget it! Two-to-one!
- Fine.

244
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,194
You got it.

245
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,124
Hey, Johnny, you're on a speed horse.
What are you doin' back here with me?

246
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:41,636
I like the conversation, and it's not
a speed horse. Don't try to hook me.

247
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,767
- You goin' tonight?
- Nah. You?

248
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,242
- Nah.
- What time?

249
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,871
<i>- I don't know. 8:00?
- Okeydoke.</i>

250
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,449
Oops. There's my hole!
Gotta go! Yah!

251
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,759
Goddamn it!

252
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,463
Whoa!

253
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,768
<i>We got him!</i>

254
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,300
- I'll take him.
- Get the hell out of here.

255
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,781
- I said, I'll take him.
- He's got a fractured foot.

256
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,647
<i>If you're gonna shoot him anyway,
I'll save you the bullet.</i>

257
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,324
<i>- Whoa.
- Fine.</i>

258
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,987
<i>Let him go.
Hey, let him have him.</i>

259
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,309
Now, bud.

260
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,384
Yeah, boy.

261
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:48,529
<i>Okeydoke, Johnny.
There's the hole! Gotta fly!</i>

262
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:56,899
<i>Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!</i>

263
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,447
<i>There once was a princess
from Siam...</i>

264
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:09,247
<i>who was sitting here
sort of like I am.</i>

265
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,020
I wined her and dined her,
and then I reclined her.

266
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:23,725
Ah, shit.
What rhymes with Siam?

267
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,702
That's great.
You make that up?

268
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:30,537
Pretty obvious, huh?

269
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:35,875
- That's beautiful.
- No. You're beautiful.

270
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,041
Don't say that.
You pay me.

271
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:46,914
So, you wanna... you know...

272
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,255
get going?

273
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,655
Sure. Why not?

274
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:15,512
- How do you miss a hole like that?
- There's my hole! Gotta fly!

275
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,611
<i>Are you blind?</i>

276
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,390
ngel, are you okay?

277
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,697
Ol!

278
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,968
Ol!

279
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,325
<i>You don't wanna watch?</i>

280
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:09,472
No. Not really.

281
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:14,074
I don't either.

282
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:18,640
Ol!

283
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,881
So, what? They brought you down here to
make you feel better? Is that it?

284
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,228
Yes. Sort of.

285
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,423
Those guys, they think
everything is fixed with a party.

286
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,028
I'm sorry. Who are you?

287
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:44,165
Oh. Marcela Zabala.

288
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:51,743
- My sister, Isabella, she's married...
- No. No, no. I know.

289
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,752
<i>Nice to meet you. Charles.
Mucho gusto.</i>

290
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,966
So, do you feel better?

291
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:21,478
No. No, not really.

292
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,477
No. How could you?

293
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,418
With something like that.

294
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:06,413
<i>Come on, buddy. Wake up.</i>

295
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,152
<i>Come on.</i>

296
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:22,632
- Did I lose?
- Oh, no. You clobbered him.

297
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,812
Easy.

298
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,507
- Easy, nice and slow.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

299
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,673
Come on.
Let me buy you some turtle soup.

300
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,097
I'm fine, George.
Go win yourself a race or something.

301
00:37:35,197 --> 00:37:37,644
Look, let's go down to Sloan's,
and we'll just...

302
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,353
I'm fine, George.

303
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:42,284
I don't need your help, and
I sure as shit don't need your charity.

304
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,894
Leave me alone,
all right?

305
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,998
It's been 20 years
since I've been on a horse.

306
00:37:57,075 --> 00:38:00,806
Don't worry. It's the kind of thing
that comes right back.

307
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:21,895
Let's go.

308
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,875
Come on!

309
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,880
<i>What? She got you back up on a horse,
and now you wanna buy 'em?</i>

310
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,123
Yeah. Maybe.
Maybe a couple.

311
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,392
Well, you wanna win or just own 'em?

312
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,786
- I wanna win.
- What sort of question is that?

313
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,396
Well, you're gonna need a trainer
before you buy horses.

314
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,560
No. You need two.
So you can fire one, eh?

315
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,076
Randy Thatcher's barn.
Trains about 50 or 60 ponies.

316
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:45,177
<i>- Good fella too. Real horse person.
- A real horse-shitter. Scusa, scusa</i>

317
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,782
Now, now. I don't know,
maybe you want a smaller barn,

318
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:49,216
somebody who can take the time...

319
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:52,913
<i>Who's that?
- Huh?</i>

320
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,654
Oh, he's a crackpot.
Lives alone in the bushes.

321
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,424
What's he do?

322
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,298
<i>I don't know.
He used to be a trainer, farrier.</i>

323
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:06,198
<i>Now he just looks after that horse.</i>

324
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,836
<i>Come on.
Let's look at another barn.</i>

325
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,422
- Howdy.
- Hello.

326
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:39,863
<i>- Wh... You hungry?
- No. No, thanks.</i>

327
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,929
I'm fine.
Charles Howard.

328
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,170
Tom... Smith.
Nice to meet you, Tom.

329
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,574
<i>What's... What's in his bandage?</i>

330
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:59,923
Oh, that's hawthorn root.
It increases circulation.

331
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,790
You wanna sit down?

332
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,853
Oh. All right.
Thank you.

333
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:14,026
Will he get better?

334
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,164
Already is... a little.

335
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:21,678
Will he race?

336
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,476
No. Not that one.

337
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:30,211
So why are you fixing him?

338
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,380
'Cause I can.

339
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:39,688
Every horse
is good for somethin'.

340
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,790
<i>He could be a cart horse
or a lead pony.</i>

341
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,928
<i>And he's still nice to look at.</i>

342
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,464
<i>You know, you don't
throw a whole life away...</i>

343
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:54,136
just 'cause
he's banged up a little.

344
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:10,827
Is that coffee?

345
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,886
Yeah.

346
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:21,100
It's bad, though.

347
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,840
<i>You always tell the truth?</i>

348
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,968
<i>Well, I try to.</i>

349
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:46,495
<i>It ain't just the speed.
It's the heart.</i>

350
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,591
You want something
that's not afraid to compete.

351
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:54,365
Half these horses
are just show ponies.

352
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,839
You want something
that's not gonna run from a fight.

353
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,172
How do you find that?

354
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:06,991
Look, I won the Robles Handicap.
I was second in the Tijuana Derby.

355
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,611
I won the Manzanita Oaks.
You know, that used to be a stakes race.

356
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:10,668
I know.

357
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:13,350
I- I would've won T.J.,
but the piece of shit lugged out on me.

358
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,759
Sounds great.
We'll let ya know.

359
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,076
Look.

360
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:19,494
I can work 'em out in the morning.

361
00:43:20,462 --> 00:43:24,164
Or, even hot-walk 'em if you need me to.

362
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:27,897
Really?
You'll hot-walk 'em?

363
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,237
This is somethin' else.

364
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,708
A dream come true,
walkin' you around.

365
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:37,208
Hook you up to a plow,
pull me around for a little while.

366
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:38,339
Come on.

367
00:43:39,215 --> 00:43:42,545
<i>You ever run in the money?
Huh?</i>

368
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,589
<i>Hey. Hey.
You ever run in the money?</i>

369
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,254
I don't think so.

370
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,592
Couldn't beat a human being,
let alone another horse.

371
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,363
<i>You goddamn
sack-of-crap old plater.</i>

372
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,500
Probably the fastest
you're gonna run in your entire life,

373
00:43:56,529 --> 00:43:59,126
you piece-of-shit old glue-pot.

374
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:03,162
That's right.

375
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,823
<i>The first time he saw Seabiscuit,</i>

376
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:25,856
<i>the colt was walking
through the fog at 5:00 in the morning.</i>

377
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:31,392
<i>Smith would say later that the horse
looked right through him...</i>

378
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:34,733
<i>as if to say,
"What the hell are you looking at?</i>

379
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:39,640
<i>- Who do you think you are?"</i>

380
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,474
<i>He was a small horse,
barely 15 hands.</i>

381
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:47,313
<i>He was hurting too.
There was a limp in his walk,</i>

382
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,911
<i>a wheezing when he breathed.</i>

383
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,548
<i>Smith didn't pay attention
to that.</i>

384
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:58,288
<i>He was looking the horse
in the eye.</i>

385
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:02,162
God... damn.

386
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:12,934
<i>He was the son of Hard Tack,
sired by the mighty Man O' War.</i>

387
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,676
<i>But the breeding did little
to impress anyone at Claiborne Farms.</i>

388
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,748
Get rid of him.

389
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,224
<i>At six months, he was shipped off
to train with the legendary trainer</i>

390
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:28,788
<i>Sunny Fitzsimmons,</i>

391
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:32,590
<i>who, over time,
developed a similar opinion of the colt.</i>

392
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:36,429
Is that a racehorse
or a lead pony?

393
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,865
<i>The judgment wasn't helped
by his gentle nature.</i>

394
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:45,671
<i>Where his sire had been a fierce,
almost violent competitor,</i>

395
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,712
<i>Seabiscuit took to sleeping
for huge chunks of the day...</i>

396
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:53,978
<i>and enjoyed lolling for hours
under the boughs of the juniper trees.</i>

397
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,612
<i>His other great talent was eating.</i>

398
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,523
<i>Though half the size of other colts,</i>

399
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,058
<i>Seabiscuit could frequently
eat twice as much.</i>

400
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:07,187
<i>Fitzsimmons decided
the horse was lazy...</i>

401
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,859
<i>and felt sure he could train
the obstinance out of him.</i>

402
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:15,572
I want you to hit him as many times
as you can over a quarter of a mile.

403
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,008
<i>When he didn't improve,
they decided the colt was incorrigible.</i>

404
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,436
<i>They made him a training partner
to better horses,</i>

405
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,006
<i>forcing him to lose
head-to-head duels...</i>

406
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,450
<i>to boost the confidence
of the other animal.</i>

407
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:32,688
<i>By the time
he was three years old,</i>

408
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:36,214
<i>Seabiscuit was struggling
in two cheap claiming races a week.</i>

409
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,995
<i>Soon he grew as bitter and angry
as his sire Hard Tack had been.</i>

410
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,904
<i>He was sold
for the rock-bottom price of $2,000.</i>

411
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,572
<i>And, of course,
it all made sense.</i>

412
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:58,445
<i>Champions were large,
they were sleek,</i>

413
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,506
<i>they were without imperfection.</i>

414
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,714
<i>When they finally did race him,</i>

415
00:47:03,814 --> 00:47:06,544
<i>he did just
what they had trained him to do.</i>

416
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,957
<i>He lost.</i>

417
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,328
What exactly is it you like?

418
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:15,422
He's got spirit.

419
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,059
I'll say.

420
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,930
Can... Can he be ridden?
Oh, sure.

421
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,536
Eventually.

422
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,549
He can be a little touchy.
Yeah, I got it.

423
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,245
No. Really.

424
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,311
I'm fine.

425
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,532
Jesus Christ!
That horse is nuts!

426
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,920
<i>Come on!
Come on! Come on!</i>

427
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,956
<i>Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!</i>

428
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,894
<i>Let's go!
Come on!</i>

429
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,006
Let's go! Come on,
you sons of bitches!

430
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,804
I'll take all of you!
Come on! Come on!

431
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,036
It's okay.

432
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,867
- I'm not afraid of you.

433
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,935
Sure. I know.

434
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,574
I know what
you're all about.

435
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:22,925
You hungry?

436
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,286
Huh?

437
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,497
Yeah. Bet you are.

438
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,233
Huh? Come on.

439
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,298
<i>Come on, boy.</i>

440
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:51,076
Yeah.

441
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,286
Why don't you just
breeze him around one turn.

442
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,024
<i>Give the folks a look.
Right.</i>

443
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,962
Red Pollard,
Mr. and Mrs. Howard.

444
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:05,958
Yeah. Hi.

445
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:09,472
Hello.

446
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,473
Well, we'll just be movin' on.

447
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,508
Does he breeze?

448
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,983
Well, we'll find out.

449
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,331
<i>Seems pretty fast.
Yeah.</i>

450
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,432
In every direction.

451
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,040
Hell, he's so beat up,
it's hard to tell what he's like.

452
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,512
<i>I just can't help feelin'
they got him...</i>

453
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,143
<i>so screwed up
runnin'in a circle,</i>

454
00:50:56,219 --> 00:51:00,178
<i>he's forgotten
what he was born to do.</i>

455
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,554
He just needs to learn
how to be a horse again.

456
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,789
Well, how do
you do that?

457
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,699
- How far do you want me to take him?
- Till he stops.

458
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,773
Okay.

459
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,839
That seems like a pretty good ride.

460
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,353
Hope so.

461
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,873
That's it, boy.

462
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,875
You're all right.

463
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,537
Let's see what you got, boy.
Ha! Ha!

464
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,070
Ha! Ha! Whoo!

465
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,016
That's it, boy. That's it!

466
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,218
Yeah!

467
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,231
Whoo!

468
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,830
Whoo-hoo!

469
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,910
- Well, at least he wasn't expensive.
- No. That's true.

470
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,657
Whoo!

471
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,065
Goddamn it!
You're an amazing animal!

472
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:58,671
Whoo!

473
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,985
You can
come inside, you know.

474
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:23,260
<i>- I'm fine. Thank you.
- Yeah, you look it.</i>

475
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,026
No, really, I'm fine.

476
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:31,039
Okay.
Suit yourself.

477
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,112
Welcome.

478
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,663
Thank you.
You're welcome.

479
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,007
<i>It's okay.</i>

480
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,020
Oh, I'm not that hungry.

481
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,716
Mmm. Sure you're not.

482
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,926
It's just a lot of food.

483
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,724
It's okay.

484
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,167
Rather have you strong than thin.

485
00:54:57,861 --> 00:54:59,988
<i>They called it "relief,"</i>

486
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,928
<i>but it was
a lot more than that.</i>

487
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:04,228
<i>It had dozens of names:</i>

488
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,792
<i>N.R.A., W.P.A.,</i>

489
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,304
<i>the C.C.C.</i>

490
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,136
<i>But it really came down
to just one thing.</i>

491
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:16,912
<i>For the first time
in a long time,</i>

492
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,971
<i>someone cared.</i>

493
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,480
<i>For the first time
in a long time,</i>

494
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,044
<i>you were no longer alone.</i>

495
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:13,122
Goat racing?

496
00:57:13,196 --> 00:57:17,132
Oh, no. Just trying
to calm him down a little.

497
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,067
Smart ones
hate being alone all the time.

498
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:22,969
- Oh.
- And sometimes another animal,

499
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,008
it just...
just soothes them a bit.

500
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,214
Pretty quiet in there.

501
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,877
What'd you do?

502
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,944
Go take a look.

503
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,425
Oh.

504
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,403
<i>♪ Rock of ages, cleft for me ♪</i>

505

508
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,678
Okay.

509
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:46,278
You don't break him or anything, but
we gotta see what he's got.

510
00:58:46,955 --> 00:58:51,591
You take him to the 5½ pole and
turn him loose.

511
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,155
Turn him loose?

512
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:56,822
Yeah, son.
He's a racehorse.

513
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,337
Ha! Ha!
Come on!

514
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,872
Come on!

515
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:16,009
Ha! Come on, I know you got
more than this! Let's show 'em, boy!

516
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,824
How's he look?

517
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,019
Asleep.

518
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:30,263
Come on!
Let's show 'em, Pops! Come on!

519
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,272
Whoo!
There it is! Yeah!

520
00:59:42,372 --> 00:59:43,403
Whoo!

521
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:45,640
Oh, my.

522
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,656
Yeah, you and me! Let's go!

523
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,424
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo!

524
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,975
<i>- Boy. Fast?
- Oh. Yeah.</i>

525
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,035
How fast?

526
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,806
Your horse just broke
the track record at Tanforan.

527
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,349
Sometimes they...
they just, uh,

528
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,359
hanker for a little competition.

529
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:42,163
<i>As long as we're talkin' long shots,
I got a real doozy for you, folks.</i>

530
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,832
We got a horse
that's going off at 70-to-1,

531
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,675
and that's a short price, my friends.

532
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,969
This horse couldn't win a church raffle,
let alone a $2,000 allowance.

533
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,010
Yeah, talk about a
jump in class.

534
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,950
This is the skunk
of the garden party.

535
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:56,000
Yes,
he's the surprise in the punch bowl.

536
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,082
As a matter of fact,
I'll lay even money that this nag,

537
01:00:58,282 --> 01:01:00,446
Seabiscuit,
couldn't even finish six furlongs.

538
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:04,156
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin live
at Clockers' Corner.

539
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:08,529
Wow.

540
01:01:08,729 --> 01:01:10,296
I wanted maroon.
They only had bright red.

541
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,614
Oh, it looks great.

542
01:01:11,914 --> 01:01:13,563
You don't think
the "H" is too big?

543
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,968
You seen
the size of our jockey?

544
01:01:28,617 --> 01:01:32,515
Okay. Favorite's
that gray over there.

545
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:34,579
He's got a big late charge,

546
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:39,185
so lock in early with him
and stay right off his flank.

547
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:40,229
Okay.

548
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:43,096
Once our boy
sees who the competition is,

549
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,100
he'll do most of the work.

550
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,102
But don't move
till that gray does.

551
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,263
What if it's late?

552
01:01:50,938 --> 01:01:51,863
Let's go.

553
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:54,466
<i>Twelve minutes to post.</i>

554
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,478
I don't think
it's gonna matter much.

555
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,208
Honestly.

556
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:31,241
<i>- Come on in.
Number 3, Pollard on Seabiscuit.</i>

557
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,153
<i>Hey, sahib.
Kinda small, isn't he?</i>

558
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:40,849
Gonna look a lot smaller
in a second, Georgie.

559
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,720
I got five bucks
says he doesn't.

560
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,058
<i>Starter's poised. The flag is up.</i>

561
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:51,931
<i>- And there they go.</i>

<i>Silver Treasure is third,
followed by Seabiscuit.</i>

564

<i>They're coming by
the five-furlong pole.</i>

565
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:17,919
<i>It's Pirate's Gold, Geronimo,
Hill's Army and Agua Dulce.</i>

566
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:25,260
Whoa!

567
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,792
Son of a bitch!
Ha! Ha!

568
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,373
Piece of shit bastard!

569
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:37,145
What the hell is he doing?

570
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,046
<i>... opening up a 3...
a 4-length lead...</i>

571
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,913
- Let's go!
- What are you doing?

572
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,044
I'm gonna put you on the rail,
you piece of shit!

573

Get off of me!

574
01:03:47,687 --> 01:03:49,085
How do you like that,
you son of a bitch?

575
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,127
You're gonna drop me, man!

576
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:56,131
<i>The two horses are flying down...

577

- Knock me off my horse!</i>

578

<i>It's Silver Treasure on the inside.</i>

579
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,079
<i>Silver Treasure on the inside.
Silver Treasure and Pirate's Gold.</i>

580
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:20,520
<i>And at the wire
it's Silver Treasure.</i>

581
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,595
Aw, damn it.

582
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,756
- What the hell were you thinkin'?
- He fouled me.

583
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,680
What am I supposed to do,
let him get away with that?

584
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,193
Well, yeah,
when he's 40-to-1.

585
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,932
- He almost put me in the rail!
- Well, did he?

586
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,304
Look, we had a plan.

587
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,207
He fouled me, Tom!

588

What am I supposed to do?
He cut me off!

589

Well, I-I need to borrow
some money.

601
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:56,779
- That's fine.
- I don't know when I can pay you back.

602
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,889
I mean, when we win.
When we win, I can pay you back.

603
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,415
That is if you
still want me to ride.

604
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,756
Of course I want you to ride.

605
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:14,569
How much do you need?

606
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,571
Uh,

607
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:20,198
ten dollars.

01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:30,714
Than... Uh...
It's fine.

610
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:39,953
Thank you.
I really appreciate it.

611
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,551
That's it, Pops.

612
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:52,299
We're okay now.
It's all right, boy.

613
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,178
Yeah, we're okay.

614
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,475
Nothing to worry about.

615
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:01,641
All the time in the world, boy.
That's it, Pops.

616
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:04,481
Nice lead.
Just like that, boy.

617
01:07:04,553 --> 01:07:06,077
Just like that.

618
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,824
What do you think, boy?
You ready to go?

619
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:16,092
You and me.
Let's go, boy. Let's go. Ha! Ha!

620
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,376
<i>Ha! Ha!</i>

621
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,999
Whoo!

622
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,708
<i>In the end, it wasn't the dams...</i>

623
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:07,312
<i>or the roads...
or the bridges or the parks.</i>

624
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:11,480
<i>Or the tunnels, or the thousands
of other public projects</i>

625
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,545
<i>that were built in those years.</i>

626
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,884
<i>It was more invisible
than that.</i>

627
01:08:18,494 --> 01:08:20,860
<i>Men who were broken
only a year before...</i>

628
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,921
<i>suddenly felt restored.</i>

629
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:27,366
<i>Men who'd been shattered
suddenly found their voice.</i>

630
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,996
Well, I just think
this horse has a lot of heart.

631
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,267
<i>He may have been down,
but he wasn't out.</i>

632
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:35,401
He may have lost a few,
but he didn't let it get to him.

633
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,878
<i>We could all learn
a lick or two from this little guy.</i>

634
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,881
Oh, and by the way,
he doesn't know he's little.

635
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,076
He thinks he's
the biggest horse out there.

636
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:45,348
<i>So you got big plans
for this little horse?</i>

637
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,685
<i>Oh, yeah. See, sometimes
when the little guy,</i>

638
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:51,590
he doesn't know he's a little guy,
he can do great big things.

639
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,587
Can we get a shot here?

640
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:56,593
See, this isn't the finish line.

641
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:58,592
The future is the finish line,

642
01:08:58,616 --> 01:09:01,068
and the Biscuit
is just the horse to get us there.

643
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,605
<i>"Just the horse to get us there."</i>

644
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,402
You certainly made a believer
out of me, Mr. Howard.

645
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,409
It's time for this old tout
to eat some crow.

646
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:13,039
Four and 20 blackbirds, to be exact,
all baked up in some humble pie,

647
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:15,208
and I'll take mine a la mode.

648
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,752
Oh.

649
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,913
And one more thing, Mr. Howard.
I just wanna say...

650
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,883
- Thanks for the champagne.
- Don't mention it.

651
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:25,218
- Did you see the infield?
- No, not yet.

652
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,152
Take a look.

653
01:09:26,252 --> 01:09:28,671
Your little horse is sellin' out
the cheap seats.

654
01:09:38,452 --> 01:09:40,677
Oh, my gosh.

655
01:09:40,855 --> 01:09:43,786
Hey, what do you think about
all those folks in the infield, Red?

656
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:46,892
That's who we're ridin' for,
folks with a quarter in their pocket.

657
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:48,996
Red! Red! Red!

658
01:09:49,064 --> 01:09:51,555
That's an awful lot of hoopla
for such a little horse!

659
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:54,796
"Though he be but little,
he is fierce."

660
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:57,696
<i>- What's that? What?
- That's Shakespeare, boys.</i>

661
01:09:57,772 --> 01:10:00,473
- That's Shakespeare.
- Oh, Shakespeare.

662
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:18,651
Holy cow!

663
01:10:21,896 --> 01:10:24,763
Look at that, Biscuit.
Look at that.

664
01:10:24,833 --> 01:10:27,358
There you go.
Oh, my God.

665
01:10:30,505 --> 01:10:34,271
There he is!
Seabiscuit! Yea!

666
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,940
That's for you, Pops.

667
01:10:41,015 --> 01:10:43,006
That's for you.

668
01:11:16,885 --> 01:11:20,068
That makes six consecutive victories
for this little colt from nowhere,

669
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,151
one shy of the record.

670
01:11:21,222 --> 01:11:24,419
Why, he may be the biggest sensation
on four legs since Hope and Crosby.

671
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:28,451
<i>Yes, it's standing room only every time
this pint-size pony slips on a saddle,</i>

672
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:31,659
and if you can't afford the quarter,
a comfy tree limb will catch you a glimpse.

673
01:11:31,733 --> 01:11:34,758
<i>So what is the secret
of this rags-to-riches story?</i>

674
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:37,396
I have it on good authority
they feed Seabiscuit...

675
01:11:37,472 --> 01:11:39,770
two pints of ice-cold beer
before every race.

676
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:42,073
<i>Reporting from trackside
in an equine exclusive,</i>

677
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,005
Oh, my gosh!

678
01:11:44,078 --> 01:11:47,243
- McGlaughlin, Movietone News.
- Who was that?

679
01:11:50,351 --> 01:11:52,410
Ahh.

680
01:11:54,789 --> 01:11:56,780
Morning.

681
01:11:58,827 --> 01:12:00,988
What... What's this?
It's beer.

682
01:12:01,062 --> 01:12:03,189
From an admiring public.

683
01:12:03,264 --> 01:12:05,630
It's pretty good too.
There's more in there.

684
01:12:09,537 --> 01:12:12,870
Where's the horse?
Signing autographs.

685
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:14,568
He what?

686
01:12:16,744 --> 01:12:20,011
Here you go, Max. Let it dry
for a minute before you try to sell it.

687
01:12:20,181 --> 01:12:22,748
Hey, Charles.
You think he can break the record?

688
01:12:22,817 --> 01:12:24,812
Oh, let's ask him.
Hey, Biscuit.

689
01:12:24,886 --> 01:12:27,948
You gonna win one more?
You gonna break the record?

690
01:12:28,623 --> 01:12:29,440
Hey, Charles.

691
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:32,058
What do you think finally
turned this horse around?

692
01:12:32,126 --> 01:12:34,754
Well, I think we just
gave him a chance.

693
01:12:34,829 --> 01:12:36,922
Sometimes all somebody needs
is a second chance.

694
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:39,592
<i>I think there are a lot
of people out there...</i>

695
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:41,931
know just what
I'm talking about.

696
01:12:42,003 --> 01:12:44,436
<i>You got that right.</i>

697
01:12:44,706 --> 01:12:47,431
Here, boys.
Take some horseshoes with you.

698
01:12:47,509 --> 01:12:50,171
- Hey, thanks.
- These are special.

699
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:53,476
- Never run out of luck.
- Great.

700
01:12:59,487 --> 01:13:03,082
Sam! Where the hell
are my horseshoes?

701
01:13:05,827 --> 01:13:08,125
You quit?
I can't work like this.

702
01:13:08,196 --> 01:13:11,290
He's not a parade animal.
He's a racehorse.

703
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:14,995
Look, Tom,
a little bit of public relations...

704
01:13:15,069 --> 01:13:17,162
I can't get him
to be a great horse...

705
01:13:17,238 --> 01:13:19,172
if I can't get the time
to work with him.

706
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,538
<i>What do you mean?
He is a great horse.</i>

707
01:13:21,609 --> 01:13:24,271
We don't know that yet.
He's won six stakes in a row.

708
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:26,813
Against who?

709
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:32,582
This... This is a great horse.

710
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:43,996
<i>First he smashed them
in the Kentucky Derby.</i>

711
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:46,195
<i>Then he crushed them
in the Preakness.</i>

712
01:13:47,369 --> 01:13:51,730
Then he destroyed all comers in
the Belmont to snatch the Triple Crown.

713
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:54,400
At almost 18 hands,
he's as big as he is fast.

714
01:13:54,475 --> 01:13:58,411
Eighteen hands?
Can't be too fast a runner.

715
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,209
Yeah, he's big.

716
01:14:01,282 --> 01:14:02,883
<i>Born of perfect breeding,</i>

717
01:14:02,983 --> 01:14:05,284
displaying perfect form,
boasting a perfect record,

718
01:14:05,353 --> 01:14:09,447
<i>the millionaire Mr. Riddle may have
finally created the perfect horse.</i>

719
01:14:09,524 --> 01:14:13,560
<i>Until next time, this is
Horace Halstedter for Metrotone News.</i>

720
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:16,889
<i>What the hell does that mean anyway?</i>

721
01:14:16,965 --> 01:14:18,995
Perfect.
He's perfect.

722
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:21,235
What the hell does "perfect" mean?

723
01:14:21,302 --> 01:14:22,302
What?

724
01:14:22,702 --> 01:14:24,203
You show me something that's perfect,

725
01:14:24,272 --> 01:14:26,866
I'll show you something that's not.

726
01:14:30,912 --> 01:14:33,505
Look, he's obviously
the best horse in the East.

727
01:14:33,581 --> 01:14:35,515
We're obviously
the best horse in the West.

728
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,676
The country deserves
to see which horse is better.

729
01:14:37,752 --> 01:14:40,022
Yo-ho-ho-ho!
You may not be able to see it, folks,

730
01:14:40,052 --> 01:14:42,052
but the gauntlet
just landed on my desk.

731
01:14:42,123 --> 01:14:44,187
Are we talking about
a match race Mr. Howard?

732
01:14:44,259 --> 01:14:45,526
Whatever Mr. Riddle wants.

733
01:14:45,626 --> 01:14:48,293
Match race, stakes race,
potato sack race.

734
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:51,764
Just 'cause we're littler
doesn't mean we're scared.

735
01:14:51,833 --> 01:14:53,767
Right you are, and in
the heartland of America,

736
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:55,735
every little guy knows
exactly what you mean.

737
01:14:55,803 --> 01:14:56,884
You hear that, Mr. Riddle?

738
01:14:56,984 --> 01:14:59,866
You have an appointment
with destiny, a date with...

739
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,437
- Destiny.
- Destiny. Yes, exactly.

740
01:15:04,512 --> 01:15:07,640
So destiny,
and his name is Seabiscuit.

741
01:15:07,715 --> 01:15:11,675
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Does Seabiscuit stand a chance...</i>

742
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:14,413
I'm glad they finally
have racing in California.

743
01:15:14,489 --> 01:15:16,923
Do they use
Western saddles out there?

744
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:19,459
<i>Look.</i>

745
01:15:19,527 --> 01:15:22,189
Comparing these two horses
is ridiculous.

746
01:15:22,263 --> 01:15:24,458
War Admiral
is a real racehorse...

747
01:15:24,532 --> 01:15:27,126
who's won every prestigious race
in America.

748
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:31,103
This little colt of theirs
is running out on some cow track.

749
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:35,332
If we responded
to every fledgling challenger...

750
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,311
who wants to make
a name for themselves,

751
01:15:38,379 --> 01:15:40,472
it wouldn't be fair to us.

752
01:15:40,548 --> 01:15:42,982
But it wouldn't be fair
to them either.

753
01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:45,849
You wouldn't put Jack Dempsey
in the ring with a middleweight.

754
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,353
<i>Huh?</i>

755
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:49,913
Would you?

756
01:15:49,991 --> 01:15:52,858
"Middleweight"?
I'll kill him.

757
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:54,861
I'll knock
his goddamn block off!

758
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:56,863
- He's chicken!
- I know. I know.

759
01:15:56,931 --> 01:15:59,024
- Middleweight?
- We just have to flush him out.

760
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,330
<i>How?</i>

761
01:16:01,402 --> 01:16:04,499
- Well, this is still America. Right?
- Yeah.

762
01:16:04,972 --> 01:16:07,505
Cash.

763
01:16:07,575 --> 01:16:08,900
A hundred thousand dollars?

764
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:11,206
The biggest purse
in American history.

765
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:12,159
I sure hope so.

766
01:16:12,259 --> 01:16:15,440
You'd get every top
Eastern thoroughbred. All of'em!

767
01:16:15,516 --> 01:16:18,041
You'd put this place on the map.

768
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:20,986
They might have all that
blue blood crap.

769
01:16:21,055 --> 01:16:23,182
Our money
is just as good as theirs.

770
01:16:23,257 --> 01:16:26,090
Charlie...
Doc, this is our moment.

771
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,061
Now, they're stuck in the past.
This is the future.

772
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:31,496
Great.

773
01:16:31,566 --> 01:16:34,535
Come here.
What?

774
01:16:34,602 --> 01:16:36,695
Come on.
Don't you wanna see 'em?

775
01:16:36,771 --> 01:16:41,970
Pilin' off of those train cars.
Comin' out here to your track.

776
01:16:43,077 --> 01:16:46,046
Huh? That's victory
in itself.

777
01:16:46,114 --> 01:16:47,877
Doc?

778
01:16:47,949 --> 01:16:51,077
That's...
That's the finish line right there.

779
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:55,213
You sell cars like this?

780
01:16:55,289 --> 01:16:57,023
Hundreds of'em.

781
01:16:57,091 --> 01:16:59,782
Hold your horses! Hold your horses!
Just when you thought you'd seen it all,

782
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:01,827
Doc Strub has gone
and raided the cookie jar.

783
01:17:01,897 --> 01:17:04,729
Yes, he has smashed the piggy bank
and sold the family silver.

784
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:06,961
$100,000 for one horse race?

785
01:17:07,034 --> 01:17:09,594
Makes me wanna walk around on all fours
and throw a saddle on my back.

786
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:12,133
Will the Biscuit be the favorite?
Not likely, folks.

787
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,697
We're about to be invaded.

788
01:17:13,775 --> 01:17:16,369
We're talking Derby winners,

789
01:17:16,444 --> 01:17:18,435
Preakness winners,
Belmont winners.

790
01:17:19,514 --> 01:17:21,709
Hold on, hold on.
I guess that's all one horse.

791
01:17:21,783 --> 01:17:22,865
But at 100,000 bucks,

792
01:17:22,965 --> 01:17:25,048
how can the Admiral
not want to dock his ship...

793
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,053
in this friendly port?

794
01:17:27,121 --> 01:17:30,490
This is Tick-Tock McGlaughlin live
from Clockers' Corner.

795
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,419
- They raised a hundred grand!
- Hey, how 'bout that hundred grander?

796
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:39,733
No, thanks.

797
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:41,894
Excuse me, boys.

798
01:17:41,969 --> 01:17:43,869
Shit!
Charles!

799
01:17:43,938 --> 01:17:47,135
Shit.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

800
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,199
The hell with it.
We'll run him anyway.

801
01:17:49,277 --> 01:17:51,871
There are still going to be
the greatest horses in the world,

802
01:17:51,946 --> 01:17:54,574
and if we win this thing,
they're gonna have to face us.

803
01:17:54,649 --> 01:17:57,880
He's gonna have to face us.

804
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:09,062
<i>Okay. Special Agent's
pure speed.</i>

805
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:11,826
He's gonna go to the lead,
but he can't handle the distance.

806
01:18:11,899 --> 01:18:14,197
So don't get sucked in.
I won't.

807
01:18:14,268 --> 01:18:16,429
Indian Broom
could be there too.

808
01:18:16,504 --> 01:18:20,941
<i>We'll know they're holdin' him back
if they use the ring bit.</i>

809
01:18:21,008 --> 01:18:26,002
<i>Now, the one to worry about
is Rosemont.</i>

810
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,674
<i>He closes
like a freight train,</i>

811
01:18:28,749 --> 01:18:30,910
<i>and he'll fight you for it
at the end.</i>

812
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:33,180
You gotta have
some momentum built up...

813
01:18:33,254 --> 01:18:35,814
by the time
he makes his move.

814
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:39,155
<i>It's still kind of soggy out there
from the other day,</i>

815
01:18:39,227 --> 01:18:42,958
<i>so try to stay off the rail
where it's deep.</i>

816
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:46,022
<i>I figured I'd sit back
about three wide.</i>

817
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,159
<i>Yeah, that's fine.</i>

818
01:18:49,837 --> 01:18:52,499
And other than that, just...

819
01:18:53,574 --> 01:18:55,508
just try to feel it.

820
01:18:57,578 --> 01:18:59,569
<i>He'll tell you
when he's ready.</i>

821
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:33,734
Yeah, boy!

822
01:20:36,777 --> 01:20:38,244
Come on, Red!

823
01:20:44,552 --> 01:20:46,782
Ha! Ha!

824
01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:58,657
Yeah, come on.
Go! Go!

825
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:09,805
- Whoo-hoo!
- Watch him. Watch him.

826
01:21:15,082 --> 01:21:17,448
Come on! Come on!

827
01:21:26,427 --> 01:21:28,361
It's not my fault.
Not this time.

828
01:21:28,429 --> 01:21:30,920
- I told you look out for Rosemont.
- I thought I had it.

829
01:21:30,998 --> 01:21:33,159
You stopped ridin'!
I couldn't see him!

830
01:21:33,234 --> 01:21:35,896
What are you talkin' about?
He was flyin' up your tail!

831
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:38,438
Yeah, well, I can't...
What?

832
01:21:38,506 --> 01:21:40,497
See out there!

833
01:21:47,848 --> 01:21:50,214
He lied to us.
What?

834
01:21:50,284 --> 01:21:53,619
He lied to us.
You want a jockey who lies to us?

835
01:21:53,787 --> 01:21:55,722
What do you mean?

836
01:21:56,290 --> 01:22:00,454
He can't see.
He's blind in one eye.

837
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:25,910
It's fine, Tom.

838
01:22:28,022 --> 01:22:30,490
- It's fine?
- Yeah, it's fine.

839
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:36,587
"You don't throw
a whole life away...

840
01:22:36,664 --> 01:22:39,929
just 'cause it's banged up
a little bit."

841
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:44,961
Good night.

842
01:22:47,141 --> 01:22:50,235
All right, all right.
Hold it.

843
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:52,279
Well, I guess
that little horse of theirs...

844
01:22:52,346 --> 01:22:54,576
turned out to be
a glorified claimer after all.

845
01:22:57,251 --> 01:23:01,182
Well, at least we don't have to deal with
this David and Goliath nonsense anymore.

846
01:23:01,255 --> 01:23:03,785
<i>- Huh? Huh?
- You can say that again.</i>

847
01:23:03,858 --> 01:23:07,054
- All right, boys. Let me through.
- Wait a minute. Mr. Riddle...

848
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:20,263
The hell with it.

849
01:23:22,943 --> 01:23:24,877
<i>Just a couple of announcements.</i>

850
01:23:24,945 --> 01:23:28,938
<i>First, Red Pollard will remain
Seabiscuit's jockey,</i>

851
01:23:29,016 --> 01:23:30,950
now and forever.

852
01:23:31,018 --> 01:23:35,455
Second, if they're too scared to come
and race us, we're gonna go find them.

853
01:23:35,523 --> 01:23:38,253
We're gonna enter every race
where War Admiral is on the card,

854
01:23:38,325 --> 01:23:41,453
and if he scratches,
which he probably will,

855
01:23:41,529 --> 01:23:43,322
we'll enter the next race
he's on the card.

856
01:23:43,497 --> 01:23:47,228
And we won't come home until
we've faced him, win, lose or draw.

857
01:23:48,936 --> 01:23:51,666
You know,

858
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:54,572
I'd rather have one horse like this
than a hundred War Admirals.

859
01:23:54,642 --> 01:23:58,601
- Thanks, fellas.

860
01:24:09,123 --> 01:24:11,353
<i>Gotta see him!
Come on!</i>

861
01:24:21,268 --> 01:24:24,237
Look, I, uh...
I really don't know what to say.

862
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:26,239
Uh, we appreciate it.

863
01:24:26,307 --> 01:24:28,434
I'm sure the Biscuit
appreciates it too.

864
01:24:28,509 --> 01:24:31,603
He's just a little shy
about speaking in public.

865
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,170
He'd thank you himself.

866
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:39,284
I guess, uh,
you all are here today...

867
01:24:39,353 --> 01:24:42,550
because this is a horse
who won't give up.

868
01:24:42,623 --> 01:24:46,650
<i>- That's right.
- Even when life beats him by a nose.</i>

869
01:24:46,727 --> 01:24:48,820
<i>That's right!
Ain't that the truth.</i>

870
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:53,661
But, heck,
everybody loses a couple.

871
01:24:53,734 --> 01:24:56,100
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

872
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:59,037
And you either pack up and you go home,
or you keep fighting!

873
01:24:59,106 --> 01:25:00,698
Isn't that right?
Yeah!

874
01:25:00,774 --> 01:25:04,073
<i>- That's right!
- That's right.</i>

875
01:25:04,144 --> 01:25:06,669
Now,

876
01:25:06,747 --> 01:25:08,908
<i>do you want to see a match race?
Yeah!</i>

877
01:25:08,983 --> 01:25:11,577
- Yeah!
- You do?

878
01:25:11,752 --> 01:25:14,815
You wanna see
this young fella ridin' that horse?

879
01:25:14,888 --> 01:25:16,719
- Yeah!
- Yes!

880
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,382
Seabiscuit!

881
01:25:21,562 --> 01:25:23,689
<i>Extra! Extra!
Biscuit on the warpath!</i>

882
01:25:23,764 --> 01:25:27,256
Will there be a match race?
It's all right here.

883
01:25:27,334 --> 01:25:29,802
<i>Extra! Extra!
Biscuit on the warpath!</i>

884
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:31,861
<i>I don't know what
they're so worried about.</i>

885
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:35,431
<i>I mean, look at us.
Our horse is too small.</i>

886
01:25:35,509 --> 01:25:37,568
Our jockey's too big.

887
01:25:37,645 --> 01:25:39,679
Our trainer is too old.

888
01:25:39,747 --> 01:25:41,461
Forgive me, Tom.

889
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:43,475
And I'm too dumb
to know the difference!

890
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:44,496
Yeah, Charlie!

891
01:25:44,596 --> 01:25:47,343
You'd think they'd want to race us
instead of running away!

892
01:25:47,421 --> 01:25:49,412
<i>Yeah!</i>

893
01:25:57,131 --> 01:26:00,897
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am staring at a swarm of humanity,

894
01:26:00,968 --> 01:26:04,233
a sea of hungry faces demanding
the match of a lifetime.

895
01:26:04,305 --> 01:26:07,240
They have come here tonight
in the cold, in the wind,

896
01:26:07,308 --> 01:26:10,106
In the chill of a late
October night.

897
01:26:10,177 --> 01:26:14,307
Let me just make my way over to one
of them so you can hear it for yourself.

898
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:16,315
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

899
01:26:16,383 --> 01:26:18,317
Ma'am, ma'am, if I may.

900
01:26:18,385 --> 01:26:20,819
What brings you out here tonight
with your three small children,

901
01:26:20,888 --> 01:26:23,254
clamoring for a view
of this little horse?

902
01:26:23,324 --> 01:26:25,315
Because we want to see
a match race!

903
01:26:28,662 --> 01:26:31,256
<i>I said, don't you think...</i>

904
01:26:31,332 --> 01:26:33,323
Mr. Riddle
owes this country a...

905
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,231
Match race!

906
01:26:35,302 --> 01:26:38,738
<i>Match race!
Match race! Match race!</i>

907
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:42,173
<i>Match race!
Match race! Match race!</i>

908
01:26:42,242 --> 01:26:44,472
<i>Match race! Match race!</i>

909
01:26:45,646 --> 01:26:47,580
Fine, but it's on my terms.

910
01:26:47,948 --> 01:26:49,479
Any terms you want.

911
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:52,485
Mile and 3/16 ths.
I won't accept anything else.

912
01:26:52,553 --> 01:26:55,113
- All right.
- Want a walk-up start with a bell.

913
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:58,449
We won't be using
any contraptions.

914
01:26:58,525 --> 01:27:00,959
You mean a starting gate?

915
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:03,946
Fine.

916
01:27:04,146 --> 01:27:06,963
And we run it here,
at our home track.

917
01:27:07,034 --> 01:27:08,825
That's not negotiable.

918
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:12,163
Mmm. Seems like
a nice enough place.

919
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:17,432
Oh, I'm sure you'll find it
quite comfortable, Mr. Howard.

920
01:27:25,919 --> 01:27:28,183
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

921
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:31,088
I wanna be a horse.

922
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:34,093
Well, you're almost
big enough.

923
01:27:34,161 --> 01:27:36,493
That's very funny.

924
01:27:36,563 --> 01:27:39,396
It doesn't even smell
like a barn.

925
01:27:39,466 --> 01:27:42,560
Hmm. They probably
deodorize it every morning.

926
01:27:42,636 --> 01:27:44,570
Well, they still crap.

927
01:27:47,207 --> 01:27:50,870
Well, they do.
They do.

928
01:27:50,944 --> 01:27:52,844
Over here, pal. Right over here!

929
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:55,905
<i>- There you go!
- This way. This way.</i>

930
01:27:55,983 --> 01:27:57,917
Biscuit, here...

931
01:27:57,985 --> 01:27:59,919
<i>Whoa!
What's that thing?</i>

932
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:05,751
<i>They got us
in the servants' quarters.</i>

933
01:28:05,826 --> 01:28:09,023
Is that him?
No.

934
01:28:11,064 --> 01:28:13,055
Bit too small.

935
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:17,603
That's him.

936
01:28:19,907 --> 01:28:22,535
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

937
01:28:29,349 --> 01:28:32,614
Maybe he's the kind of horse
that just looks good in the paddock.

938
01:28:38,192 --> 01:28:40,660
Wow.

939
01:28:42,896 --> 01:28:45,057
We gotta get to the lead.

940
01:28:45,132 --> 01:28:47,293
Biscuit never goes
to the lead.

941
01:28:47,367 --> 01:28:51,701
I know, but...
we gotta teach him to break first.

942
01:28:51,772 --> 01:28:54,971
If that monster shakes loose,

943
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:57,201
<i>we'll never catch him.</i>

944
01:28:58,278 --> 01:29:00,405
What, retrain him?

945
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:06,244
We got two weeks.

946
01:29:14,127 --> 01:29:16,220
Excuse me.

947
01:29:16,296 --> 01:29:18,321
Uh,

948
01:29:18,398 --> 01:29:21,231
we'd like to buy
your bell.

949
01:29:23,303 --> 01:29:26,704
- They didn't tell me you were comin'.
- Oh, probably just an oversight.

950
01:29:26,773 --> 01:29:28,707
Do you want me
to turn on some lights?

951
01:29:28,775 --> 01:29:30,436
No. No.
No?

952
01:29:30,511 --> 01:29:35,380
<i>Okay. It's a predatory
response.</i>

953
01:29:35,449 --> 01:29:37,781
If I just brush it
past his flank,

954
01:29:37,851 --> 01:29:39,485
he'll bolt.

955
01:29:39,553 --> 01:29:41,803
We want to teach him
to do it with the bell.

956
01:29:41,803 --> 01:29:43,254
How far you want me to take him?

957
01:29:43,323 --> 01:29:46,781
A hundred feet.
Just so he learns to break first.

958
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,192
Okay. Got it.

959
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:53,422
- You ready?
- Ready.

960
01:30:17,291 --> 01:30:20,385
All right.
Here we go.

961
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:41,240
Oh, come on, Tom!
When you gonna work that horse out?

962
01:30:42,549 --> 01:30:44,483
When he wakes up, I guess.

963
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:47,384
Geez!

964
01:30:47,454 --> 01:30:49,251
<i>For cryin' out loud!</i>

965
01:30:50,924 --> 01:30:52,858
<i>The whole track?</i>

966
01:30:52,926 --> 01:30:55,554
I just want him
to do it once...

967
01:30:55,629 --> 01:30:57,654
with nothin'
in front of him.

968
01:30:57,731 --> 01:31:01,326
- Yeah, but I can't see out there.
- That's all right. He can.

969
01:31:01,401 --> 01:31:05,030
Aw, come on, Tom.
Tom, please. Wha...

970
01:31:05,105 --> 01:31:07,437
Why do you always
have to do this? Shit!

971
01:31:09,607 --> 01:31:10,999
Oh, great.

972
01:31:14,581 --> 01:31:16,606
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

973
01:31:22,055 --> 01:31:24,046
<i>Wow. Huh.</i>

974
01:31:25,225 --> 01:31:27,420
Oh, my God.

975
01:31:39,339 --> 01:31:41,330
<i>- Tim.
- Hey.</i>

976
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:45,774
Pumpkin. Hey.

977
01:31:45,846 --> 01:31:48,679
How ya doin', Pumpkin?

978
01:31:48,749 --> 01:31:51,217
Ohhh. Are you shy?

979
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:54,778
<i>Hey, Red?</i>

980
01:31:57,491 --> 01:31:59,482
Oh, my gosh.

981
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,927
Yeah. Guess I should have used you
as a jockey instead of a groom.

982
01:32:03,997 --> 01:32:06,261
No, no. It was...

983
01:32:06,333 --> 01:32:08,267
That was great.

984
01:32:09,336 --> 01:32:11,327
Look, I-I'm in a little trouble.

985
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:15,102
I got this horse over in Annex,
and I been tryin' to sell a share of him.

986
01:32:15,175 --> 01:32:17,075
<i>Tough times and all?</i>

987
01:32:17,144 --> 01:32:20,341
I was wonderin' if...
if maybe you'd breeze him for me.

988
01:32:20,414 --> 01:32:23,679
<i>If folks saw
Red Pollard...</i>

989
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,218
Yeah. I'll breeze
your horse for you.

990
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:31,323
It's on.
Good.

991
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:33,955
Just take him for five furlongs
at around a minute-one.

992
01:32:34,027 --> 01:32:36,696
- Can he do that?
- Should.

993
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:43,492
<i>Try it now.</i>

994
01:32:53,113 --> 01:32:55,775
Okay, try it again.

995
01:32:58,285 --> 01:33:01,152
Whoa! Whoa!

996
01:33:01,221 --> 01:33:04,122
Easy! Easy! Easy!

997
01:33:16,803 --> 01:33:20,534
Aaah!

998
01:33:22,075 --> 01:33:24,134
<i>- Stop it!
- Whoa!</i>

999
01:33:58,179 --> 01:34:01,827
Look, most of the damage
was restricted to his leg.

1000
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,176
How bad is it?

1001
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:06,242
God, I don't know.
It's, uh, shattered.

1002
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:08,913
Eleven, 12 breaks.
Something like that.

1003
01:34:08,989 --> 01:34:12,254
We're gonna
have to operate.

1004
01:34:12,325 --> 01:34:14,520
Just sit tight for me.

1005
01:34:55,902 --> 01:34:58,336
<i>Well, we're all done.</i>

1006
01:34:58,405 --> 01:35:01,499
He'll always limp, but, uh,
it looks like he's gonna walk again.

1007
01:35:01,575 --> 01:35:04,976
W-Will he ride?

1008
01:35:05,145 --> 01:35:07,843
No, he's not gonna ride.

1009
01:35:07,914 --> 01:35:11,509
- Y-You're sure?
- He won't ride. He's gonna walk.

1010
01:35:11,585 --> 01:35:13,712
You take care.

1011
01:35:13,787 --> 01:35:15,778
Th... Thank you.

1012
01:35:19,659 --> 01:35:21,320
Hey.

1013
01:35:21,394 --> 01:35:24,227
Uh, you should see
the other guy.

1014
01:35:24,297 --> 01:35:25,494
You're gonna be fine.

1015
01:35:25,594 --> 01:35:28,791
Couple of months,
you're gonna be up and around like new.

1016
01:35:29,469 --> 01:35:33,533
I'm the one who makes up the stories,
remember?

1017
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:37,199
Well, yeah.

1018
01:35:37,277 --> 01:35:40,110
Uh, maybe a little longer
than that.

1019
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,171
Yeah.

1020
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:49,120
Look, I, uh... I think we're
gonna have to scratch.

1021
01:35:49,189 --> 01:35:52,716
No.
No, don't scratch.

1022
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:55,886
Son, he's a great horse,
but he can't run by himself.

1023
01:35:55,962 --> 01:35:58,863
Don't scratch.

1024
01:36:04,304 --> 01:36:07,637
Call Woolf.

1025
01:36:07,707 --> 01:36:11,837
- Son, nobody's riding...
- It's okay.

1026
01:36:11,912 --> 01:36:13,971
Call him.

1027
01:36:14,047 --> 01:36:15,581
<i>Are you gonna scratch?</i>

1028
01:36:15,649 --> 01:36:17,783
No, we're not gonna scratch.

1029
01:36:17,851 --> 01:36:21,214
Red Pollard wants Seabiscuit to win this
race more than anything in the world.

1030
01:36:21,288 --> 01:36:23,188
He wouldn't let us scratch.

1031
01:36:23,256 --> 01:36:25,816
Thank you much.
I appreciate it.

1032
01:36:25,892 --> 01:36:28,383
You're welcome.

1033
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:31,161
<i>The Iceman cometh!
What a pinch hitter.</i>

1034
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:33,300
<i>Why, it's like getting Babe Ruth
off the bench.</i>

1035
01:36:33,311 --> 01:36:35,892
<i>Nerves of steel,
ice water in his veins.</i>

1036
01:36:35,968 --> 01:36:37,002
Why, George Woolf is...

1037
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,404
Irrelevant.

1038
01:36:38,472 --> 01:36:41,764
They can get the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse as far as I'm concerned.

1039
01:36:41,842 --> 01:36:43,199
Won't make any difference.

1040
01:36:43,205 --> 01:36:46,169
War Admiral is a superior horse
with superior breeding.

1041
01:36:46,246 --> 01:36:48,771
Doesn't matter
who the passenger is.

1042
01:36:51,318 --> 01:36:53,479
He's got a strong left lead,
Georgie.

1043
01:36:53,553 --> 01:36:55,714
Banks like
a friggin' airplane.

1044
01:36:55,789 --> 01:36:59,489
He might need help switching to it, so
ease him off the rail just before the turn.

1045
01:36:59,759 --> 01:37:02,594
- Like you did in the Gold Cup.
- Exactly.

1046
01:37:02,662 --> 01:37:05,426
He needs a good warm-up,
so take him out slow.

1047
01:37:05,498 --> 01:37:08,126
When you do ask him,
don't use the whip.

1048
01:37:08,201 --> 01:37:12,103
Just flick it twice, show him it's there.
He'll know it's time.

1049
01:37:12,172 --> 01:37:15,107
Right.

1050
01:37:15,175 --> 01:37:18,542
And, um, never on the left side.

1051
01:37:18,611 --> 01:37:21,944
They hit him on the left side
when he was a baby.

1052
01:37:22,015 --> 01:37:25,246
<i>I wish it was you, Johnny.
Aw, come on.</i>

1053
01:37:25,318 --> 01:37:28,378
I'll be right there with you.

1054
01:37:30,256 --> 01:37:32,816
Aaah!

1055
01:37:32,892 --> 01:37:36,157
Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya!

1056
01:37:37,964 --> 01:37:41,957
Great. Now, show him the stick
at the quarter pole,

1057
01:37:42,035 --> 01:37:44,936
and he'll give you
a whole new gear.

1058
01:37:49,476 --> 01:37:51,307
<i>Okay, now,</i>

1059
01:37:51,378 --> 01:37:54,836
force him to that left lead
a little earlier,

1060
01:37:54,914 --> 01:37:57,940
<i>and he'll give you even more.</i>

1061
01:38:00,186 --> 01:38:02,347
<i>Great, now</i>

1062
01:38:02,422 --> 01:38:04,287
shut the door.

1063
01:38:20,507 --> 01:38:21,654
Okay.

1064
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:25,501
You know how Smith wants you
to fight for the lead by the first turn?

1065
01:38:25,578 --> 01:38:29,207
Yeah. We were workin'
with that bell.

1066
01:38:29,282 --> 01:38:32,342
- I was a little nervous about that.
- No, that's fine.

1067
01:38:32,419 --> 01:38:35,217
But you gotta give it up
on the backstretch.

1068
01:38:35,288 --> 01:38:38,553
Give it up?
Give him back the lead.

1069
01:38:39,859 --> 01:38:41,884
He fights for it, Georgie.

1070
01:38:41,961 --> 01:38:45,260
If you bring him head to head
with that other horse,

1071
01:38:45,331 --> 01:38:47,492
and he looks him in the eye,

1072
01:38:47,567 --> 01:38:50,035
there's no way
he loses that race.

1073
01:38:50,103 --> 01:38:54,005
<i>You just hold him
through that final turn...</i>

1074
01:38:54,074 --> 01:38:56,736
and let him get
a good look at the Admiral.

1075
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:59,574
Then let him go.

1076
01:38:59,646 --> 01:39:03,241
It's not in his feet, Georgie.

1077
01:39:03,316 --> 01:39:05,910
<i>It's right here.</i>

1078
01:39:11,224 --> 01:39:13,692
<i>By 10:00 a.m.
The closest place to park...</i>

1079
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,853
<i>was 15 blocks away.</i>

1080
01:39:15,929 --> 01:39:18,864
<i>The volume of refreshments alone
was staggering.</i>

1081
01:39:18,932 --> 01:39:21,730
<i>Seventeen thousand gallons
of lemonade.</i>

1082
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:24,668
<i>Sixty thousand hot dogs.</i>

1083
01:39:24,737 --> 01:39:27,865
<i>Two thousand kegs of beer.</i>

1084
01:39:27,941 --> 01:39:29,932
<i>NBC broadcast the race,</i>

1085
01:39:30,009 --> 01:39:33,706
<i>and businesses around America
scheduled a half day of work...</i>

1086
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,907
<i>so their employees
could hear the call,</i>

1087
01:39:35,982 --> 01:39:39,315
<i>thanks, in part, to a missive
fired by Mr. Howard only the day before.</i>

1088
01:39:39,385 --> 01:39:42,047
Look, I know this is
a fancy track and all,

1089
01:39:42,122 --> 01:39:44,454
but I think they oughta
open up the infield...

1090
01:39:44,524 --> 01:39:47,357
so normal folks
can come see the race.

1091
01:39:47,427 --> 01:39:50,225
You shouldn't have to be rich
to enjoy something like this.

1092
01:39:50,296 --> 01:39:54,528
<i>Seabiscuit entered the race
a two-to-one underdog,</i>

1093
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:57,536
<i>but you would never know it
from the growing noise in the infield.</i>

1094
01:39:57,604 --> 01:39:59,231
<i>Get your program!</i>

1095
01:39:59,305 --> 01:40:02,468
<i>By the time it was over,
more than 40 million Americans...</i>

1096
01:40:02,542 --> 01:40:04,908
<i>would hear the call.</i>

1097
01:40:04,978 --> 01:40:09,312
<i>Okay, it's... it's still
kinda soggy at the rail,</i>

1098
01:40:09,382 --> 01:40:12,545
<i>so try to keep him
out of there.</i>

1099
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:16,248
There's a dry tractor tread
about five feet out off the fence.

1100
01:40:16,322 --> 01:40:19,314
I walked the track
this morning.

1101
01:40:19,392 --> 01:40:21,656
Good. Good.

1102
01:40:21,728 --> 01:40:26,461
Now, he oughta break
just like we worked on.

1103
01:40:28,001 --> 01:40:31,835
But, um,
there's one more thing.

1104
01:40:31,905 --> 01:40:34,897
What? Let him catch me
on the backstretch?

1105
01:40:36,142 --> 01:40:39,077
You're not the only one
who knows this horse.

1106
01:40:42,649 --> 01:40:44,514
<i>Safe trip, George.</i>

1107
01:40:44,584 --> 01:40:47,417
And a short one.
Let's go, Sam.

1108
01:40:55,261 --> 01:40:57,923
Charley!
George. Huh.

1109
01:40:57,997 --> 01:41:00,431
<i>The two jockeys have
acknowledged each other.</i>

1110
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:03,731
It's a quick hello,
like boxers touching gloves.

1111
01:41:03,803 --> 01:41:06,135
Come on, George.
This is no time for small talk.

1112
01:41:06,206 --> 01:41:09,698
<i>Both the horses are now on the main track,
and you can hear the roar from the crowd.</i>

1113
01:41:33,299 --> 01:41:35,563
There he is!

1114
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:46,968
<i>It's Seabiscuit by a nose,
now by a head.</i>

1115
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:51,636
<i>He's leading War Admiral,
pressing on him a neck behind.</i>

1116
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:56,478
<i>They fly toward the clubhouse turn.
Who will be into it first?</i>

1117
01:42:56,549 --> 01:43:00,576
<i>It's Seabiscuit, and he was there first
and driving for the backstretch!</i>

1118
01:43:08,761 --> 01:43:12,788
<i>Now, coming into the backstretch,
it's Seabiscuit.</i>

1119
01:43:12,865 --> 01:43:16,062
<i>Going down the backstretch.</i>

1120
01:43:30,983 --> 01:43:33,781
Now, back him off, son.
Back him off. Back him off.

1121
01:43:36,723 --> 01:43:39,590
Come on back, George.
Come on, come on, come on.

1122
01:43:39,659 --> 01:43:43,561
<i>Now on the backstretch,
Seabiscuit still with the lead.</i>

1123
01:43:43,629 --> 01:43:45,927
Come on, Georgie.
Don't fool around.

1124
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,436
I sure hope you're right, Red.
Here we go.

1125
01:43:51,504 --> 01:43:53,438
Easy, Pops.

1126
01:43:59,278 --> 01:44:01,212
Goddamn it, Johnny.

1127
01:44:11,524 --> 01:44:15,590
<i>It's now War Admiral!
It's War Admiral!</i>

1128
01:44:15,662 --> 01:44:20,096
<i>It's Seabiscuit and War Admiral, neck
and neck as they go down the backstretch!</i>

1129
01:44:25,972 --> 01:44:29,305
Close, Pops.
Easy, Pops.

1130
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:33,338
That's it.
Whoo.

1131
01:44:39,318 --> 01:44:42,344
<i>It's Seabiscuit. Now War Admiral!
Now Seabiscuit! Now War Admiral!</i>

1132
01:44:42,422 --> 01:44:44,219
Not going now, Pops.

1133
01:44:59,605 --> 01:45:01,698
Do it.

1134
01:45:01,774 --> 01:45:03,765
Do it now.
Come on, George!

1135
01:45:03,843 --> 01:45:06,937
- Turn him loose. Turn him loose.
- Do it now, George!

1136
01:45:08,614 --> 01:45:10,775
So long, Charley!

1137
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:13,011
Hyah!

1138
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:18,420
<i>- Turn him loose!
- Here comes Seabiscuit!</i>

1139
01:45:23,429 --> 01:45:26,262
<i>It's Seabiscuit going away!</i>

1140
01:45:29,101 --> 01:45:31,968
Come on, Biscuit!

1141
01:45:45,952 --> 01:45:49,149
Yes! Yes! Whoo! Yes!

1142
01:46:52,418 --> 01:46:54,477
Congratulations.

1143
01:46:54,554 --> 01:46:56,988
- Amazing.
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1144
01:46:57,056 --> 01:47:00,048
Iceman, you did it.
How does it feel?

1145
01:47:00,126 --> 01:47:00,922
<i>Well, I just wish</i>

1146
01:47:00,942 --> 01:47:03,459
my good friend Red Pollard
was up here today instead of me.

1147
01:47:03,529 --> 01:47:05,520
He will be.

1148
01:47:09,502 --> 01:47:13,802
<i>This concludes our radio broadcast
of the race of the century.</i>

1149
01:47:13,873 --> 01:47:17,240
<i>Now a word from our sponsor,
the American Oil Company.</i>

1150
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:20,711
<i>Money can't buy
a finer motor oil...</i>

1151
01:47:38,798 --> 01:47:41,358
Easy does it.

1152
01:47:41,434 --> 01:47:44,460
Watch it. Wa...
Watch those wheels.

1153
01:48:37,790 --> 01:48:39,561
<i>All hail the conquering hero.</i>

1154
01:48:39,571 --> 01:48:41,453
Yes, folks, he's back.
The little engine that could.

1155
01:48:41,527 --> 01:48:44,010
No more match races for this
little pony because, quite frankly,

1156
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:45,293
they're all outta matches.

1157
01:48:45,364 --> 01:48:48,959
Who's he gonna race? Pegasus?
I pity these other horses. Heh.

1158
01:50:44,817 --> 01:50:47,149
When will they know?
I don't know.

1159
01:50:47,219 --> 01:50:50,780
Maybe an hour. I'm not sure.
Charles is with the vet right now.

1160
01:50:53,092 --> 01:50:56,152
Does it hurt when he bends it? 'Cause
if it doesn't hurt when he bends it...

1161
01:50:56,228 --> 01:50:58,958
We don't know anything yet.
I'll call you as soon as we do.

1162
01:50:59,031 --> 01:51:01,522
I promise.
All right.

1163
01:51:06,272 --> 01:51:10,709
He was runnin' easy on me.
There was no warning.

1164
01:51:10,776 --> 01:51:13,574
He's gotta be all right.
He's gotta be all right.

1165
01:51:15,481 --> 01:51:17,847
Mr. Howard.

1166
01:51:23,956 --> 01:51:28,222
<i>Well, he ruptured
a whole ligament.</i>

1167
01:51:28,294 --> 01:51:31,354
<i>I put a splint on him
just to keep him immobilized,</i>

1168
01:51:31,430 --> 01:51:33,660
but right now
he's totally lame.

1169
01:51:35,401 --> 01:51:37,335
He's not gonna race again.

1170
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:44,470
Look, um...

1171
01:51:45,544 --> 01:51:47,610
I know this is hard,

1172
01:51:47,626 --> 01:51:50,108
but I'll put him down for you
if you want me to.

1173
01:52:26,485 --> 01:52:29,579
Oh, that's okay, Pops.
I'll come to you.

1174
01:52:35,828 --> 01:52:37,819
Hey.

1175
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:52,700
Mmm.

1176
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:12,493
See,

1177
01:53:12,564 --> 01:53:16,295
first you gotta get
a little flexibility.

1178
01:53:16,368 --> 01:53:19,098
Yeah. Then you can
put weight on it.

1179
01:53:19,171 --> 01:53:21,271
Then once you
start to put weight on it,

1180
01:53:21,371 --> 01:53:23,471
the whole leg gets stronger.

1181
01:53:23,542 --> 01:53:27,069
I know. I know.
I'm in a hurry too, Pops.

1182
01:53:27,146 --> 01:53:30,115
But you know what Hadrian
said about Rome.

1183
01:53:30,182 --> 01:53:32,673
"Brick by brick, my citizens.

1184
01:53:32,751 --> 01:53:34,844
Brick by brick."

1185
01:53:36,322 --> 01:53:38,586
See,

1186
01:53:38,657 --> 01:53:40,784
they're Arabians,

1187
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:43,089
so they don't need
to drink.

1188
01:53:43,162 --> 01:53:47,326
These horses can go
five or six days...

1189
01:53:47,399 --> 01:53:51,062
without a drop of water,
like a camel.

1190
01:53:51,136 --> 01:53:54,833
Oh. I'm not sayin'
that's what you should do.

1191
01:53:54,907 --> 01:53:58,707
I'm just saying
that's what they do.

1192
01:54:00,813 --> 01:54:03,304
Oh, good idea.

1193
01:54:04,516 --> 01:54:07,110
Take a little rest.

1194
01:54:44,656 --> 01:54:45,490
<i>I don't know, Red.</i>

1195
01:54:46,058 --> 01:54:48,591
We're just gonna walk in a circle.

1196
01:54:48,991 --> 01:54:51,024
You think the leg will hold you?

1197
01:54:51,897 --> 01:54:54,991
Horse weighs 1,200 pounds, Sam.
I'm an afterthought.

1198
01:54:55,067 --> 01:54:57,035
<i>No, I mean your leg.</i>

1199
01:55:03,442 --> 01:55:07,538
<i>Here comes Seabiscuit
charging down the lane,</i>

1200
01:55:07,613 --> 01:55:10,446
<i>picking off competition
one by one.</i>

1201
01:55:10,516 --> 01:55:13,110
He's third! Now second!

1202
01:55:13,185 --> 01:55:15,119
Now first!

1203
01:55:15,187 --> 01:55:17,781
And it's Seabiscuit at the wire...

1204
01:55:17,856 --> 01:55:22,259
to win the Santa Anita Handicap
with Red Pollard aboard! Yes!

1205
01:55:27,366 --> 01:55:29,357
Nice.

1206
01:55:42,714 --> 01:55:44,705
What?

1207
01:55:59,398 --> 01:56:01,389
Whoa!

1208
01:56:01,467 --> 01:56:03,992
Whoa, Pops. Easy.

1209
01:56:07,573 --> 01:56:09,973
Whoa.

1210
01:56:10,042 --> 01:56:13,068
Wow. Wow, Pops.

1211
01:56:13,145 --> 01:56:15,773
You feel better,
don't you, boy?

1212
01:56:21,420 --> 01:56:24,253
It's okay, Sam.
I'm just gonna mow the lawn a little bit.

1213
01:56:24,323 --> 01:56:26,814
Fine with me, Red.

1214
01:56:37,169 --> 01:56:41,003
Way to go!
All right.

1215
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,040
Looking good.
Yeah, you're great, man!

1216
01:56:52,918 --> 01:56:56,410
Whoo!

1217
01:57:34,293 --> 01:57:36,261
Is it even possible?
Sure.

1218
01:57:36,328 --> 01:57:38,387
Most folks
don't give it a chance.

1219
01:57:38,463 --> 01:57:40,556
Most folks just...

1220
01:57:41,701 --> 01:57:43,451
<i>The best thing to do</i>

1221
01:57:43,551 --> 01:57:47,102
is get him down there
and let him gallop a little.

1222
01:57:47,172 --> 01:57:49,250
That's the only way
we're really gonna know.

1223
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:50,869
Can he handle that?

1224
01:57:50,943 --> 01:57:53,741
Sure.
I mean, I-I think so.

1225
01:58:16,235 --> 01:58:18,863
He worked great.
I couldn't feel a thing.

1226
01:58:18,937 --> 01:58:22,270
Why don't we give him
a full work on Friday morning.

1227
01:58:22,341 --> 01:58:24,935
Maybe six furlongs.
See what we got.

1228
01:58:25,010 --> 01:58:27,308
Sure. I'll be here.

1229
01:58:27,379 --> 01:58:29,438
Thanks, George.
You're welcome.

1230
01:58:31,550 --> 01:58:33,541
Comin' along.

1231
01:58:35,153 --> 01:58:37,417
Could he be ready?

1232
01:58:37,489 --> 01:58:41,220
For what?
Come on. You know what.

1233
01:58:48,533 --> 01:58:51,331
Top of the morning to you.

1234
01:58:51,403 --> 01:58:54,263
That's, uh...
That's a nice colt. Who is he?

1235
01:58:54,339 --> 01:58:56,170
Just a two-year-old.
He's not ready yet.

1236
01:58:56,370 --> 01:58:57,702
Ah.

1237
01:58:57,776 --> 01:59:00,139
I thought maybe you were getting
a horse ready for the hundred grander.

1238
01:59:00,213 --> 01:59:03,345
- No.
- Just a two-year-old.

1239
01:59:05,250 --> 01:59:06,911
Hair of the dog.

1240
01:59:09,154 --> 01:59:11,679
- You been here long?
- No. Just got here.

1241
01:59:11,757 --> 01:59:14,749
Catching up
on my reading.

1242
01:59:14,826 --> 01:59:18,184
- Well, I'm sure I'll see you soon.
- Okeydokey.

1243
01:59:22,767 --> 01:59:25,159
Stop the presses!
Stop the presses!

1244
01:59:25,237 --> 01:59:26,571
This isn't a scoop, folks.

1245
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:29,720
This is three scoops
with hot fudge and a cherry on top.

1246
01:59:29,742 --> 01:59:33,873
And throw in some nuts,
'cause this little horse drives me crazy!

1247
01:59:34,845 --> 01:59:37,542
Guess who may be working
six furlongs next Friday.

1248
01:59:37,616 --> 01:59:39,146
Guess who may be shooting
for the Big 'Cap.

1249
01:59:39,246 --> 01:59:40,776
Oh, my! Saints alive!

1250
01:59:40,852 --> 01:59:43,116
You guessed it.
Man, oh, man!

1251
01:59:43,188 --> 01:59:45,782
Did you ever guess it!

1252
01:59:59,638 --> 02:00:04,439
A minute-12, minute-13.
Something like that.

1253
02:00:04,509 --> 02:00:06,841
He starts to labor,
just slow it down.

1254
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:10,746
Try and see how he feels...
Oh, oh. Whoa, whoa.

1255
02:00:10,816 --> 02:00:12,408
<i>Got you.</i>

1256
02:00:22,728 --> 02:00:25,720
That's all right, Pops.
That's okay, boy. That's okay.

1257
02:00:25,797 --> 02:00:28,425
Come here. It's okay.

1258
02:00:38,944 --> 02:00:42,937
And this, the most
unkindest cut of all.

1259
02:00:45,751 --> 02:00:49,118
Red.
Red, let me talk to you.

1260
02:00:49,187 --> 02:00:50,578
- Talk to me?
- You can't... Red!

1261
02:00:50,656 --> 02:00:53,489
You can't do it! You could be
crippled for the rest of your life.

1262
02:00:53,559 --> 02:00:55,592
<i>I was crippled for the rest of my life.</i>

1263
02:00:55,692 --> 02:00:57,526
<i>I got better.</i>

1264
02:00:57,596 --> 02:01:01,293
He made me better.
Hell, you made me better.

1265
02:01:04,336 --> 02:01:07,533
Jesus Christ.
Red...

1266
02:01:09,775 --> 02:01:13,643
And that's as much my horse
as it is yours.

1267
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:25,483
That's pretty quick.
Goddamn it.

1268
02:01:25,857 --> 02:01:28,993
- It's up to him, Red.
- Yeah, but if he says that I can't...

1269
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:32,223
He's the doctor.
It's up to him.

1270
02:01:34,366 --> 02:01:36,300
<i>You made this?</i>

1271
02:01:36,368 --> 02:01:38,427
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1272
02:01:38,503 --> 02:01:41,438
It... It wraps around
my riding boot,

1273
02:01:41,506 --> 02:01:44,168
- fasten it all the way up the calf.
- Right.

1274
02:01:44,242 --> 02:01:47,575
I barely feel anything
in the stirrups.

1275
02:01:53,351 --> 02:01:55,809
<i>Look,
it could shatter at any moment,</i>

1276
02:01:55,888 --> 02:01:58,203
even right now.
Forget about racing.

1277
02:01:58,303 --> 02:02:01,018
You see that right there?
That's barely healed.

1278
02:02:01,092 --> 02:02:05,791
There's no way to know how much
weight it could hold under stress.

1279
02:02:05,864 --> 02:02:10,801
If it gets reinjured,
it's possible he could never walk again.

1280
02:02:11,069 --> 02:02:14,703
<i>Possible. He just said
it was possible.</i>

1281
02:02:14,773 --> 02:02:17,867
Well, hell, anything's possible.
We proved that already, didn't we?

1282
02:02:17,943 --> 02:02:21,470
- This is different.
- Yeah! This is really different.

1283
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:29,744
It's not just a race.
It's the Santa Anita.

1284
02:02:29,821 --> 02:02:32,483
I had that race.
I was there.

1285
02:02:32,557 --> 02:02:34,491
I know.

1286
02:02:39,631 --> 02:02:44,227
♪ If I had a million dollars ♪

1287
02:02:44,302 --> 02:02:47,328
<i>What's going on?</i>

1288
02:02:56,748 --> 02:03:01,082
Well, even... even with the brace,
it'll barely hold him.

1289
02:03:01,152 --> 02:03:03,213
If he gets bumped,
if he gets jostled...

1290
02:03:03,288 --> 02:03:06,449
- Do you want to know what I think?
- Of course.

1291
02:03:06,525 --> 02:03:10,618
I think it's better to break a man's leg
than his heart.

1292
02:03:12,964 --> 02:03:15,358
- It's not just the leg. It's not!
- Okay.

1293
02:03:15,434 --> 02:03:18,029
Mar, he could fall.
He could get trampled.

1294
02:03:18,303 --> 02:03:21,361
- If he gets thrown from that horse...
- He could die?

1295
02:03:33,919 --> 02:03:38,049
You know,
I play with this thing all the time too.

1296
02:03:39,925 --> 02:03:43,259
And no matter how hard I try, I can't get
that damn ball to stay in the hole.

1297
02:03:45,764 --> 02:03:47,925
It always rolls out again.

1298
02:03:55,407 --> 02:03:58,740
Just let him ride, Charles.

1299
02:03:59,911 --> 02:04:01,970
Just let him do it.

1300
02:04:09,220 --> 02:04:12,519
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat, I could handle
one comeback, but this is ridiculous.

1301
02:04:12,591 --> 02:04:13,930
Who's next... Lazarus?

1302
02:04:13,954 --> 02:04:16,618
Oh, the heroism,
the madness, the excitement.

1303
02:04:16,695 --> 02:04:19,255
The largest crowd
ever to see a race at Santa Anita!

1304
02:04:19,331 --> 02:04:22,459
Fifty-five thousand in the stands,
20,000 in the infield,

1305
02:04:22,534 --> 02:04:24,968
and it's only 12:00!

1306
02:04:42,854 --> 02:04:44,788
It's not bad.

1307
02:04:46,825 --> 02:04:49,259
St. Christopher.

1308
02:04:49,327 --> 02:04:51,352
For luck.

1309
02:04:51,429 --> 02:04:53,829
A little late for that,
don't you think?

1310
02:05:01,272 --> 02:05:04,332
All right.
Let's go win us a race.

1311
02:05:19,924 --> 02:05:22,586
Ready?
Yup.

1312
02:05:37,742 --> 02:05:39,676
Whichcee's the speed.

1313
02:05:39,744 --> 02:05:42,736
<i>He's gonna be
out on the lead, but...</i>

1314
02:05:42,814 --> 02:05:45,305
I don't think
he'll handle the distance.

1315
02:05:45,383 --> 02:05:47,715
Just stalk him
like always.

1316
02:05:47,786 --> 02:05:50,186
Right.

1317
02:05:50,255 --> 02:05:52,587
Wedding Call
could make a late run.

1318
02:05:52,657 --> 02:05:54,591
Now, he's got some guts,

1319
02:05:54,659 --> 02:05:58,151
<i>so look out for him too.
Won't make that mistake again.</i>

1320
02:06:03,101 --> 02:06:06,662
Relax, guys.
It's gonna be fine.

1321
02:06:06,738 --> 02:06:09,332
Okay.

1322
02:06:33,865 --> 02:06:35,599
- Charles, it's gonna be great.
- Thank you, Frank.

1323
02:06:35,799 --> 02:06:37,834
- Hope so.
- Bless you.

1324
02:06:38,303 --> 02:06:40,794
- Good luck, Mr. Howard.
- Thank you.

1325
02:06:48,813 --> 02:06:51,008
Good luck.
You're lookin' good.

1326
02:06:51,082 --> 02:06:53,073
Well, I feel fine.

1327
02:06:55,453 --> 02:06:59,617
<i>Relax. Buy you a couple
of drinks, huh?</i>

1328
02:06:59,691 --> 02:07:02,319
That's a good idea.

1329
02:07:02,393 --> 02:07:04,384
<i>Who you bettin' on?</i>

1330
02:07:50,175 --> 02:07:52,109
<i>Hey, old man.</i>

1331
02:07:52,177 --> 02:07:55,250
- What are you doing here?
- Got another mount.

1332
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:57,742
Just 'cause I'm not riding him
doesn't mean I'm gonna sit it out.

1333
02:07:58,616 --> 02:08:02,185
<i>Don't worry.
I don't stand a chance.</i>

1334
02:08:02,353 --> 02:08:04,787
I'll see you at the finish.

1335
02:08:54,572 --> 02:08:57,336
Aaah.

1336
02:09:05,350 --> 02:09:07,716

1337
02:09:23,101 --> 02:09:25,035

Come on! Go!

1340
02:09:56,267 --> 02:09:58,901
- How you doin', Red?
- Georgie.

1341
02:09:58,970 --> 02:10:01,598

1342
02:10:04,375 --> 02:10:06,943
