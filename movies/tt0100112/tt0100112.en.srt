2
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,437
To Zaza, who will see herself.

3
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,028
My mind is cluttered
with memories...

4
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,269
It began on the beach
at Luc-sur-Mer.

5
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,190
Mother had made wool bathing trunks
for my brother and me.

6
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,075
They had red pom-poms,

7
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,714
like cherries.

8
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,870
Not only were those fruity ornaments
absurd,

9
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,158
but the trunks never dried.

10
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,113
We were always in the sea,

11
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,073
so the wool stayed wet all day,

12
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,271
sand stuck to our asses,

13
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,280
which made my crotch
extremely sore.

14
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,875
After a week,

15
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,594
I had to walk with my leg spread

16
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,075
to avoid screaming in pain.

17
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,919
I'm angry at mother
for making us wear

18
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,954
those trunks four years in a row.

19
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,958
But I'm glad
she unintentionally drew

20
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,118
my attention to my genitals.

21
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,876
That summer, I realized

22
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,469
I had to take good care of my balls.

23
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,795
I'm off to the barber's.

24
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,591
Again?

25
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,509
I was around 12.

26
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,952
I loved going to the barber's.

27
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,071
In our town there was a barber shop

28
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,959
for men only,

29
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,549
run by a beautiful Alsatian woman:

30
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,678
the lovely Mrs. Sheaffer.

31
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,388
She had few clients

32
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,951
so you didn't need
an appointment.

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,468
She had no husband,

34
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,075
but many lovers.

35
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,472
I adored going there.

36
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,997
When I opened the door,
a wonderful smell

37
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,271
flooded my nostrils, a mixture

38
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,677
of lotion, hair spray,
rose water, shampoo...

39
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,953
It was intoxicating.

40
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
The most extraordinary smell of all

41
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,750
was her own.

42
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,792
She had red hair

43
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,879
and a pronounced body odor

44
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,237
that no doubt bothered some clients,

45
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,749
but drove me wild.

46
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,710
Her body seemed to smell of love.

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,109
I adored that.

48
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,909
What can I cut?

49
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,157
My mother likes my hair short.

50
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,516
The shampoo was the first delight.

51
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,910
Mrs. Shaeffer bent over me,

52
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,675
her bust almost touching my face.

53
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,349
I inhaled deeply,

54
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,393
silently, to immerse myself
in her smell.

55
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,394
At night, in bed,
I could still smell it

56
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,314
and I yearned
to take her in my arms.

57
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,559
School going well?

58
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,193
Good student?

59
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,869
You're lucky.

60
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,548
I hated school.
Didn't like the discipline.

61
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,674
You haven't finished this crossword.

62
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,630
Oh yes... thanks...
I'll do it later.

63
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,151
In June 1947, before vacation,

64
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,989
something happened
that I've always remembered.

65
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,033
It was very hot.

66
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,638
She smelled divine.

67
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,758
That evening,
having seen her heavy,

68
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,269
ideally round breast,

69
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,157
I was still so disturbed
I couldn't speak.

70
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,553
You alright, Antoine?

71
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,954
I'm fine.

72
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,675
You look funny.

73
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,359
Dinner's ready!

74
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,710
What's a binary system?

75
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,229
I'll put it

76
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,476
another way:

77
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,391
What is a binary cat?

78
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,590
You don't know, of course.

79
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,076
Again, I will have to bail you out!

80
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,156
A normal cat

81
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,476
is a cat that has

82
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,591
one head, two eyes

83
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,313
and four paws.

84
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,670
A binary cat

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,275
has one head,

86
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,198
one eye, one eye,

87
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,470
one paw, one paw, one paw

88
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,352
and one paw.

89
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,273
You see the difference?

90
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,471
I thought you'd say that.

91
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,113
He sees a difference!

92
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,548
He's hopeless!

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,672
What'd you want to be in life?

94
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,710
Civil engineer.

95
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,798
Why not a tightrope walker?

96
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,798
Let him be, he's young yet.

97
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,194
I'm disappointed.

98
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,478
If you start small, you end small.

99
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,236
And you?

100
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,153
What'll you do later on?

101
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,278
Later on, I'll marry a hairdresser.

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,915
Why did I do that?

103
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,712
Tell me why I did that.

104
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,189
It's me, Mom. Open up.

105
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,639
Your father is sorry.

106
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,991
He was surprised, don't you see?

107
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,510
Are you sick?

108
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,429
Answer me!

109
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,590
Antoine?

110
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,549
Do you hear me?

111
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,954
What are you doing?

112
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,309
Are you alright?

113
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,516
Well?

114
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,199
He's not answering.

115
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,108
Maybe he passed out!

116
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,277
From a slap?

117
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,753
I'm worried!
We'll have to break down the door!

118
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,190
Calm down! I'll talk to him.

119
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,510
Antoine, it's Dad. I apologize.

120
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,153
I'm sorry for what I did.

121
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,873
Do what you want in life.

122
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,316
I stayed there an hour,
staring at the ceiling.

123
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,874
Mrs. Shaeffer was already mine.

124
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,908
Her body, her smell was mine.

125
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,069
I had won:

126
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,831
I'd be a hairdresser's husband.

127
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,033
There's a storm coming.

128
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,959
Maybe.

129
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,359
Hello, Mr. Morvoisieux.

130
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,509
If plastic flowers grew in a garden,

131
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,273
that would be proof...

132
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,799
And the smell?

133
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,194
You make me laugh,

134
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,434
you know nothing exists
without a model.

135
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,032
Plastic flowers are OK,

136
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,232
but there had to be
natural ones first,

137
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,715
or there'd be
no artificial ones now!

138
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,996
Coffee grinders?

139
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,872
What about them?

140
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,309
They exist, right?

141
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,953
Yes, go on...

142
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,673
They don't grow on trees,

143
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,188
or exist in nature,

144
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,516
but we have them.

145
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,756
So you can make a grinder

146
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,631
without a model.

147
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,398
We're talking about God!

148
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,669
God!

149
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,437
Howthe hell
did we get onto coffee grinders?

150
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,032
What phony reasoning!

151
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,952
So you say!
You always want to be right!

152
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,630
Coffee grinders
was just an example.

153
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,272
God is infinite.
You can't fathom Him.

154
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,595
Same thing.

155
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,358
God exists.

156
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,071
So you say, but...

157
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,673
He's stooping lately.

158
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,991
It's just his jacket wrinkling.

159
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,394
Before, he'd have avoided that.

160
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,238
You're right. He's aging.

161
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,190
10 years ago, Mathilde worked
in Isidore's Barber Shop.

162
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,236
Her boss, Isidore Agopian,
had 3 female hairdressers.

163
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,668
He was homosexual.

164
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,394
So he hated doing women's hair.

165
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,910
Mathilde was his favorite.

166
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,795
Her tact, her charm,
her slightly sad

167
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,833
but infinitely gracious air

168
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,758
delighted the clientele.

169
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,116
When Mr. Isidore retired in the '60s

170
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,631
he offered the shop to Mathilde.

171
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,876
To me?

172
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,394
I haven't the money!

173
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,511
That's OK,
I don't need it all now.

174
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,508
Pay a bit every month until I die.
Like an annuity.

175
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,314
I'd like to know
the shop is in your hands.

176
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,192
You're kind, I trust you.

177
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,435
Say yes.

178
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,191
Mathilde

179
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,795
agreed.

180
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,512
She had to get rid of
the two other employees,

181
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,835
who were jealous.

182
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,108
Liking solitude,
she ran the shop alone.

183
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,550
It was too big for her, but so what?

184
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,599
That was when I met her.

185
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,639
Can you take me?

186
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,669
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone.

187
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,788
I beg your pardon,

188
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,552
I see I needed an appointment.

189
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,437
Come back in half an hour.

190
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,591
Got any errands to do?

191
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,075
Yes... fine... Great.

192
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,348
Want my name?

193
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,076
Don't bother.

194
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,752
Too hard? You giving up?

195
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,077
I never give up!

196
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,192
Remember that crosswords
are like women:

197
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,119
resistance makes surrender sweeter.

198
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,753
I know what I'm talking about.

199
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,713
You'll see I'm right later on.

200
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,231
Later on, when I do crosswords?

201
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,431
In a way.

202
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,035
Repeat this:
the more they resist...

203
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,477
the sweeter the surrender.

204
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,870
Good. Go and play now.

205
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,634
Pull up your trunks,
hide your testicles.

206
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,034
No one came.

207
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,233
Later on, Mathilde...

208
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,359
I didn't know then
her name was Mathilde

209
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,198
...never breathed a word

210
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,436
about her phantom client.

211
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,072
Was it an unconscious comc-on?

212
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,759
I never knew.

213
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,515
But I was devastated:
for the second time in my life,

214
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,278
after so long a search,

215
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,519
I loved a hairdresser.

216
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,911
After 25 minutes, I gave up
and went to the woman

217
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,998
with whom I knew I'd spend my life.

218
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,236
Hello again.

219
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,637
I always start badly:
I'm too nervous to shut up.

220
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,434
In a shoestore I say
"I'd like some shoes..."

221
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,153
Today I asked for a haircut.

222
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,554
It's for a haircut.

223
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,235
Do you part it?

224
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,597
I... yes... if you want...

225
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,748
It's up to you.

226
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,357
Alright. But not too sharp.

227
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,749
Don't worry.

228
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,588
You have a tuft.

229
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,877
I know. I've always had it.

230
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,432
Your hair was cut too short.

231
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,668
I go to the barber's often.
I love that.

232
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,632
Really? Why?

233
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,955
I don't know.

234
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,599
Naturally,

235
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,555
I wondered if Mathilde

236
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,909
wore a bra.

237
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,115
I was soon certain she did not.

238
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,074
I imagined

239
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,909
her nipples
rubbing against her blouse,

240
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,318
and, aroused, pointing at my neck.

241
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,275
Those breasts would soon be mine.

242
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,716
I already wanted to stroke them.

243
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,994
The autopsy on Mrs. Sheaffer showed
a massive dose of barbiturates.

244
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,197
No will, no note,

245
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,799
a hasty funeral,

246
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,550
which, of course,
I could not attend.

247
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,150
Since then I've never stopped
thinking of her,

248
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,079
and ardently loving women's breasts.

249
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,713
Will you marry me?

250
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,875
35 francs.

251
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,675
Forgive me.

252
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,550
I recall that sleepless night
under Mathilde's window.

253
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,275
I wanted her to toss and turn,
throw off the sheets,

254
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,077
get up for a glass of water,
look in the mirror,

255
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,113
and undress
before going back to bed...

256
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,959
thinking of me.

257
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,879
In fact, she may have been
sound asleep.

258
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,150
Maybe she had forgotten me.

259
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,715
Why assume she is alone in bed?

260
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,798
I don't know her.

261
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,631
My father

262
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,399
said life was simple,

263
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,989
that if you wanted something enough

264
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:01,950
you'd get it.

265
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,388
Failure was proof

266
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,830
the desire wasn't strong enough.

267
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,397
No dream is impossible.

268
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,594
I wanted Mathilde
more than anything.

269
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,712
She'd be like this stream:
the fort had to fall.

270
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,990
I'd make her mine forever.

271
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,395
3 weeks later,
I returned to the shop,

272
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,637
hardly nervous,
just deliciously excited.

273
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,395
My hair hadn't had time
to grow back

274
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,558
enough to justify a haircut.

275
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,550
Mathilde acted as if she'd never
seen me before...

276
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,353
Silent and distant.

277
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,518
Which made me want her even more.

278
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,838
She probably knew that.

279
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,597
Imagine, he'd never been to a barber
in his life!

280
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,636
When his hair

281
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,229
scratched his neck,
he clipped it off himself...

282
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,311
Didn't need a mirror.
He worked by feel.

283
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,396
He did fine.

284
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,669
All with clippers,
"like mowing the lawn".

285
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,033
I can still hear him. Quite a guy!

286
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,075
They don't make 'em...

287
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,679
like him any more.

288
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,675
Finished.

289
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,592
It was faster this time.

290
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,712
I didn't do the streaks,
it's too soon.

291
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,519
I'll do them next time.

292
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,393
Will it stay puffed like that?

293
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,350
Sure, why not?

294
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,598
Mr. Agopian made me sleep
on my back.

295
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,233
Don't bother with that.

296
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,670
Come in Saturday,
I'll comb it for you.

297
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,869
That's nice of you.

298
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,950
Till Saturday.

299
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,037
What got into you the other day?

300
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,879
You were probably
making fun of me, but...

301
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,429
if you weren't teasing,

302
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,835
then I appreciate your proposal.

303
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,672
If it still holds,

304
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,916
yes,

305
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,274
I'll marry you.

306
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,833
My name is Mathilde.

307
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,350
The first time I came in,
I asked if you could take me.

308
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,834
You said no,

309
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,395
but in fact
you were already taking me.

310
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,789
I remember.

311
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,468
And I asked if I had
to give you my name.

312
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,557
Again you said no.

313
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,476
Yet you've just let me
give it to you.

314
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,752
Amusing, these encounters...

315
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,631
You've muscles in your thighs.

316
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,196
I played soccer in school -
I was a right back.

317
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,314
- You know about soccer?
- Sure. There's a ball...

318
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,837
You can't use hands,
and it's a team game...

319
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,871
I see you're an expert.

320
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,870
Sports annoy me. Like travel.

321
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,951
I don't like going out either.

322
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,229
That's fine.

323
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,070
It's settled: we'll stay here.
It'll be great.

324
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,476
I think so.

325
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,516
I'll handle the errands,
mail letters and so on.

326
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,789
I love your hands.

327
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,549
I noticed them at once.
Beautiful!

328
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,679
You have a scar there,
like a half-moon.

329
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,995
I fell off a bike.

330
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,838
You bicycle, too?

331
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,474
Not any more.

332
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,869
The past is dead.

333
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,115
Absolutely.

334
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,631
The apartment's upstairs.
It's small, but...

335
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,513
Want to see?

336
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,473
My name is Antoine.

337
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,269
When I told I was marrying
a hairdresser, Dad died

338
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,675
of a heart attack.

339
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,270
Out of loyalty, mother refused
to meet Mathilde

340
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,959
or see the shop.

341
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,831
Mathilde

342
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,996
had no family.

343
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,553
Hey, you big jerk...

344
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,075
you haven't opened my gift.

345
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,069
Is it a surprise?

346
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,554
Surprise?

347
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,671
It'll certainly surprise you.

348
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,869
You alarm me.

349
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,594
We were with my brother, his wife,

350
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,995
and Mr. Agopian.

351
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,031
At least it was intimate.

352
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,149
I insist you wear it. Recognize it?

353
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,510
How could I forget?

354
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,394
Used to be too big,
now it'll fit like a glove,

355
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,589
so to speak.

356
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,996
Wear it tonight.

357
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,553
Cut it out...

358
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,037
Oddly enough, I'm pleased.

359
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,549
I love pom-poms.

360
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,751
They're cherries, not pom-poms.

361
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,913
It bags when it's wet.

362
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,238
You know knitted wool...

363
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,517
Try it on, for old times' sake.

364
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,790
I bet it still fits you.

365
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,876
Here...

366
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,191
It's from your mother.

367
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,709
How old were you?

368
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,796
12.

369
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,591
Strange...

370
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,315
It's like a scale model of you.

371
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,071
- You look like a joker.
- I was.

372
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,991
Can I see your childhood photos?

373
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,633
I didn't keep any.

374
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,115
They bother me.

375
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,639
Why?

376
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,034
Time flies too fast.

377
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,755
The wrong name

378
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,359
can wreck a product.

379
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,834
So how can a guy

380
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,873
named Givenchy

381
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,433
sell so much perfume?

382
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,070
I'll make a confession:
my real name's Dupre...

383
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,629
Ambroise Dupre.

384
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,635
And Agopian?

385
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,150
Exoticism, my friend...

386
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,396
Armenian, meaning Oriental.

387
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,477
An Oriental barber is class...

388
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,911
Sorry...

389
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,353
I thought it was open.

390
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,992
I forgot to lock the door.

391
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,519
Besides, it's Sunday.

392
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,639
So it is!

393
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,076
I'm a fool!

394
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,029
I'll be off.

395
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,908
Have some champagne with us.

396
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,951
I don't want to bother you...
You're getting married.

397
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,276
You're not bothering us.

398
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,870
Yes... I am!

399
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,079
It's a family affair...

400
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,718
When you're among family...

401
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,870
Why'd you come?

402
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,876
For my beard...

403
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,634
I wanted it cut off.

404
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,511
All of it?

405
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,595
People say it makes me look sad,

406
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,314
so when I happened by, I thought...

407
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,273
Sit down, it'll only take 5 minutes.

408
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,870
Too bad.

409
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,349
Sorry.

410
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,952
No, not today.

411
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,069
Lots of happiness...

412
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,112
Mathilde was my life.

413
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,952
I knew that when they'd gone,
when the door closed,

414
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,436
everything would be set forever,
for us both.

415
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,070
The shop would close in on us.

416
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,112
We'd be so closely welded

417
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,312
that nothing cold or evil
could slip between us,

418
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,750
nothing harsh or chilling...

419
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,109
ever...

420
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,513
We went to Luc-sur-Mer

421
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,713
so Mathilde could see
where I wore the woolen trunks.

422
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,595
A short honeymoon:
we were in a rush

423
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,554
to begin our real life
on our stationary luxury liner.

424
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,756
Wait...

425
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,875
Sit down.

426
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,238
A bit shorter. Not too much.

427
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,352
Sit up straight.

428
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,629
Sorry, Madam,

429
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,195
we don't do women.

430
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,709
I know.

431
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,271
Excuse me.

432
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,959
You asked for it! So there!

433
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,837
Apologize to these folks.
They must be shocked

434
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,314
by your conduct.

435
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,999
They don't know yours.

436
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,753
I doubt if they care.

437
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,796
This is my wife,

438
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,519
Germaine Gora.

439
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,397
I'm Julien Gora.

440
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,873
See how neat that was?
On the button!

441
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,599
She's amazing!

442
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,591
She used to play ping-pong.
We still have the cups.

443
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,552
Club trophies.

444
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,792
Forget the haircut. It's no use.

445
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,593
A bit of lotion, then?

446
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,315
If you like... lotion's nice.

447
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,237
She's stopped playing
because of the kids. Three!

448
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,793
Raising them's a job.

449
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,356
My hat's off to her for that.

450
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,357
But she's no mere housewife
pushing a broom.

451
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,395
You noticed her clothes,
her make-up.

452
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,438
What'd you think of her?

453
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,831
Nice, very nice.

454
00:39:00,305 --> 00:40:00,258
