2
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:20,074
My good brother.

3
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,206
That's it? No suitcase?

4
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,751
Let's just get out of here.

5
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:32,628
Don't smoke in the car.

6
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:55,819
- Afternoon, Miss Graves. Welcome.
- Hello.

7
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:03,035
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

8
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:06,038
- Shall I take your coat?
- No, thanks. I'm not staying.

9
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:08,498
Brad, Dex, sorry I can't stay for lunch.

10
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:12,294
I have a board meeting in Detroit.
This won't take long.

11
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:15,714
Nothing for me.
No, maybe I'll have a Diet Coke.

12
00:03:15,798 --> 00:03:18,300
Make that Evian water, please.

13
00:03:18,592 --> 00:03:21,595
I'll have San Pellegrino water. No ice.

14
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,307
Here's the deal. There's no deal.

15
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,393
- My client balked.
- What do you mean?

16
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:31,897
- She thinks her company's worth more.
- She thinks or you think?

17
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:35,026
On second thought, that looks interesting.

18
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:39,155
- Just tell us what you want and don't say...
- Smoked chicken?

19
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:43,201
I've got to make a phone call.

20
00:03:43,284 --> 00:03:45,995
It's just us here. What are you looking for?

21
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,331
I'm looking for a world of fair play...

22
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:51,542
...where corporate big guys
don't always get their way.

23
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:53,878
Still beating up on your ex-husband?

24
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:57,131
You're gonna pay for that one.

25
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,133
Who's her husband?

26
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:00,802
Me and my big mouth.

27
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,012
Pookie!

28
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,389
Don't call me Pookie.

29
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:07,684
Sorry. I just meant to be affectionate.
What's the matter?

30
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:11,438
Nothing. I'm just in a meeting
and I don't have a lot of time.

31
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:17,235
Remember when you said you wanted
to have sex with me in a weird place?

32
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,779
How about Detroit?

33
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:23,116
Too kinky. Anyway, they're installing
my big screen on Sunday...

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,453
...and I have the Mile High Mall
presentation in Denver next week.

35
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:30,624
- What will I do by myself in Detroit?
- Buy a Chevy. Prove you're American.

36
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,585
I don't love you, and I won't miss you.

37
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,504
Call me when you get there.

38
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,089
'Bye.

39
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:04,367
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Diggs.

40
00:05:05,326 --> 00:05:07,286
Go right in. Enjoy the party.

41
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,774
Thank you very much.
It will be taken care of.

42
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,275
It's my pleasure.

43
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,446
What happened, Boss?

44
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,700
Did they go for it? They're crazy not to.

45
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,036
What do these Colombians want?
It's foolproof!

46
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:52,833
We got all the customs agents,
the border guards. Everything's in place!

47
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,503
We've got a little problem.
A cloud over us.

48
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:58,964
The cartel's made an offer of $50 million.

49
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:04,512
It will be on the table for 30 days
if we can make this little problem go away.

50
00:06:04,595 --> 00:06:07,306
Jarmin. They know about Jarmin, right?

51
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,433
It's time to finish it.

52
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:11,686
We've got to find him and take him out.

53
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:13,688
Easier said than done.

54
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:17,733
We'll do it ourselves this time.
Make sure it gets done right.

55
00:06:18,985 --> 00:06:20,111
Lovely day.

56
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:25,658
But we have a little cloud to blow away.

57
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:48,431
Closing down, Billy Ray.

58
00:06:48,515 --> 00:06:51,184
Nobody driving
in this bad weather tonight.

59
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,150
Why don't you give up on that tank,
come on over to the house for dinner?

60
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:01,737
It's no good you being alone so much.

61
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:06,408
Been in town three months,
you haven't made one friend.

62
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,744
At least none that I've seen.

63
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:12,831
Why don't you wash up,
come and meet the missus tonight?

64
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:14,875
Hear me?

65
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:19,380
I'm gonna turn down this radio.

66
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,717
You gone to sleep under there?

67
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,597
God! Help me, Marvin!

68
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,601
Help me! Pull me out!
Get me out of here!

69
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,228
- Hold on!
- Help me.

70
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,522
Get me out!

71
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:37,732
Goddamn it!

72
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:38,983
Get this off of me!

73
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,280
What am I gonna do with no legs?

74
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:47,825
Look at you!

75
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:53,331
Something wrong with your brain?

76
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:59,671
I'm sorry. I gotta do something
to break up the monotony around here.

77
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,047
You're bored?

78
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:04,759
I'm bored as hell. Don't take it personal.

79
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,555
I'm just a restless guy.
That's the kind of guy I am.

80
00:08:08,638 --> 00:08:11,391
That's why I travel around so much.

81
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:16,480
I get it from my daddy. He's a traveling
salesman. Sold hairbrushes in Kentucky.

82
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,817
Thought you said your dad raised hogs
in Tennessee.

83
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:24,655
He raised hogs and he sold hairbrushes.

84
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,865
You'll bullshit at the drop of a hat.

85
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,744
You can't say you never pulled
anybody's leg before.

86
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:35,082
I'll get it.

87
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,628
Thank you for that dinner invitation.

88
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:48,763
- May I help you, ma'am?
- Unleaded, please.

89
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,399
- Hey, is that WJB on the radio?
- I have no idea.

90
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:03,236
Yep, that's what it is. That's a '60s station.

91
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:05,572
I listen to that one all day.

92
00:09:05,655 --> 00:09:08,491
You know what they say about the '60s,
don't you?

93
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:11,161
If you can remember them,
you wasn't there.

94
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:18,501
- Want me to check under the hood?
- No. It's rented.

95
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:21,671
You come to Detroit
and you rent a Beemer?

96
00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:26,051
That's like going to Germany
and eating Jimmy Dean sausages.

97
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,015
In Tennessee, where I was born,
I never saw cars like this.

98
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,643
I was 22 before
I knew foreigners made cars.

99
00:09:34,726 --> 00:09:36,311
Are you from Tennessee?

100
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:39,898
- Yes, ma'am, I'm a Southern boy.
- What's your name?

101
00:09:39,982 --> 00:09:41,233
Billy Ray.

102
00:09:41,316 --> 00:09:45,446
Named after both the scoundrels my mama
thought might have been my daddy.

103
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:51,452
Is that cash or card, ma'am?

104
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,289
Rick?

105
00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:56,999
Beg your pardon?

106
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,672
- Will MasterCard do?
- Just fine.

107
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:11,639
- You remind me of someone a lot.
- I do?

108
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,641
Yeah, a boy. A man.

109
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:17,478
Named Rick Jarmin.
His plane went down in Mexico.

110
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,897
Fifteen years ago.

111
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:25,695
- I never went to Mexico, but...
- You laugh like him.

112
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:28,907
- I didn't mean to.
- You look like him.

113
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,868
I don't know what to tell you.
Want to sign that?

114
00:10:42,838 --> 00:10:44,506
You have a nice day.

115
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:47,509
- Billy Ray?
- Ma'am?

116
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,471
Do you have a tattoo?

117
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:53,348
Tattoo? No.

118
00:10:58,729 --> 00:11:00,814
Your upper right arm. A dove.

119
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,109
I don't have a tattoo.

120
00:11:05,027 --> 00:11:07,321
I'm not leaving till you show me.

121
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:14,203
I hope nobody's looking. There. Satisfied?

122
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:16,372
Right arm.

123
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:28,134
I got some shrapnel in Vietnam.
It's down my side. Want to see it?

124
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:32,513
I'm sorry. My friend
would have never been in that war.

125
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:35,808
Meaning what?

126
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,732
He was very much against killing.

127
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,448
I'd like to help you, sir,
but Officer Baird is retired.

128
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:56,746
That's not possible!
He wouldn't retire without telling me.

129
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,416
He's been handling my case
for the last 15 years.

130
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:03,587
Give me your current name and ID, and
I'll connect you with your new case officer.

131
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,882
With all due respect,
I don't know who the hell you are.

132
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:11,553
If I give you my name and number,
you'll know everything.

133
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:14,640
- Hold, please.
- No, hang on. Damn it! Hello?

134
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,143
Excuse me.

135
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:23,232
That call you've been waiting for?
He's on the line.

136
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:27,236
He won't give me his current name
or location. He wants Lou Baird.

137
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,489
Rick? How you doing?

138
00:12:30,573 --> 00:12:34,785
This is Joe Weyburn. Remember me?
I set you up at that photo lab in Cleveland.

139
00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:38,331
Was it 1978? No, 1979.

140
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,584
I don't remember you.

141
00:12:43,544 --> 00:12:46,214
You know us FBI guys all look alike.

142
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,646
You are one rolling stone, aren't you?
Where are you now, Rick?

143
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:04,357
Where's Lou? He would have told me
he was retiring.

144
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:07,777
- Why didn't he do that?
- To tell you the truth, he lost you.

145
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,529
- He lost me?
- Yeah.

146
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:13,074
That's why we put him out to pasture,
why I'm on the case.

147
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,493
Where is he? Where did he retire to?

148
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:19,122
Where did he retire to?

149
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,128
He once gave me a number.
His sister's place in St. Louis.

150
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:28,757
He used to go there on vacations.
Is that where he is? Am I getting warm?

151
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,260
He's out of the picture.

152
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:34,263
Are you in some kind of trouble?

153
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,307
Not at all. Where's Sorenson?

154
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:44,481
Still safely in jail as far as I know.

155
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,862
Nothing to worry about.
He's never getting out!

156
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:51,322
His partner?

157
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,240
- Diggs?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,496
Unless he's made another pass at you...

159
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:02,250
...he's probably got his drug money
living the good life in South America.

160
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,336
- We have no idea where he is.
- That's a relief.

161
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:07,922
So what is it...

162
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,465
...relocation time?

163
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,634
I guess. Where can you put me?

164
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,721
Where are you now?
And what name are you using?

165
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:20,602
Come on, I'm just trying to do my job.

166
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,066
Bowers, Billy Ray.
I live above Marvin's Motown Motors.

167
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:30,153
1840 Canoga Street, Detroit.
Did you get that? I'm not repeating it.

168
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:34,658
Somebody recognized me.
I want to get out before they come back.

169
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,039
Right.

170
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,293
Two days.

171
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:45,711
Two days?

172
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:50,799
Hang on and we'll have somebody
come in and get you.

173
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,885
Okay, I'll be hanging.

174
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:37,388
The drop in foreign sales...

175
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,850
...reflects both the negative effect
of the strengthening dollar...

176
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:44,688
...and an upsurge in competitive
production in Europe and Asia.

177
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:48,441
Add this to the recent surcharge
imposed by the EEC nations...

178
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:53,238
...it's clear that to preserve the profit
our shareholders expect...

179
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:56,783
...we have to make cuts
to our production costs.

180
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,536
While it is true our rising costs...

181
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:04,333
...will be defrayed by the acquisition of
Coleman Shipping, we should be clear...

182
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:40,828
You're freaking me out!

183
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,789
All those opposed?

184
00:16:44,332 --> 00:16:47,210
If Miss Graves will respond?

185
00:16:48,544 --> 00:16:52,257
- Miss Graves!
- Yes.

186
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:56,094
No.

187
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,973
You are abstaining from the final vote?

188
00:17:01,224 --> 00:17:03,476
Yes. No, I am not.

189
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:06,897
I see.

190
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:16,782
She says to me, "Marvin,
you're not getting any younger.

191
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:22,287
"Think about that young man working
for you, and offer him a partnership."

192
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:26,125
- We don't have no sons.
- You ain't known me but three months.

193
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,753
How do you know you can trust me
to stick around or not steal from you?

194
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,588
I got my eyes on you.

195
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:34,883
The hand is quicker than the eye.

196
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:37,303
I'm going upstairs and get some sleep.

197
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:40,681
See you in the morning.
Think about that partnership.

198
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:51,484
- I'll see you in the morning.
- That mean it's a deal?

199
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,987
I sure will think about it.

200
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,447
Good night.

201
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,683
Pumps are closed.

202
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,565
Pumps are closed.
She won't be humming again till 6:30 a.m.

203
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,526
You Billy Ray Bowers?

204
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,200
Y'all from Weyburn's office?

205
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,162
Y'all got an interesting accent.

206
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,080
Shit.

207
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,792
You always were an actor,
weren't you, Rick?

208
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,379
- You pretended to be my friend.
- I never did.

209
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,173
- Then you turned on me.
- I never agreed to help you kill.

210
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:40,011
Still a do-gooder?
My friend, Mr. Diggs, is worried about that.

211
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:46,017
I've served my time, thanks to you,
but he's still under indictment.

212
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,813
Seeing as you're the only living witness
that can put him behind bars...

213
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:52,065
What's he got on you? You still his flunky?

214
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:56,695
Are you some hero?
Hiding in a grease pit for 15 years?

215
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,365
I don't think they'll put up
any monuments for you.

216
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,576
Any last words?

217
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,170
What's going on?

218
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,298
Get out of here! Run for your damn life!

219
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,551
Watch out!

220
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:10,896
Help!

221
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,038
- Let me in!
- Rick, is that you?

222
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:29,915
Yeah, it's me! Let me in!

223
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:35,379
- How do I know it's you?
- It's me, Muffy. Open the damn door!

224
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:45,139
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Me? What the hell are you doing here?

225
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:47,016
Being shot in the butt.

226
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:50,144
- She saw you.
- I saw her, too.

227
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:16,296
I appreciate this.
I'll have to borrow your phone if it's okay.

228
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:18,673
Ice. I need plenty of ice.

229
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:22,135
I'll get the ice. You go to the room.
It's the presidential suite.

230
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:25,347
- Okay if I use your phone?
- I'll be there in a minute.

231
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:36,191
- Miss Graves?
- Mr. Takawaki!

232
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:39,069
Do little party?

233
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:43,616
Yes. A party for girls.

234
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:46,243
Maybe next time?

235
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:47,786
Maybe.

236
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:56,379
I don't care if they've left for the day.

237
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,507
I've got to get through to them.

238
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,385
313...

239
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:07,140
...555-7000.

240
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:09,684
Yes. The presidential suite.

241
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:12,770
Operator? God!

242
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,940
- Rick?
- What?

243
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:17,942
Are you all right?

244
00:23:18,568 --> 00:23:20,904
I've been shot in the butt.
Can you believe it?

245
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:24,449
- Can I come in?
- I'm naked. Can you handle it?

246
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:28,119
I handled it for a lot of years.
I guess I can handle it now.

247
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:35,502
It's my lower back and my butt.
I think the pellet passed through...

248
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:36,795
Vietnam?

249
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:41,049
Hell, no. I took the dove off with a sander.

250
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,345
I really am anxious to hear this story.

251
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:48,807
I need some bandages,
antibiotic and some antiseptic.

252
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,434
Get shot often?

253
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:52,895
Only twice before.

254
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:55,606
Could you please help me?
Could you look at my butt?

255
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,524
You leave me at the altar.

256
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,404
That was my state of mind at the time.

257
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:05,407
You went off with Jamie
to seek your fortune...

258
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:07,952
...and you were coming back to marry me.

259
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:12,123
Am I remembering this correctly?
If not, correct me.

260
00:24:13,374 --> 00:24:17,712
You get lost in your plane.
Reported missing, presumed dead.

261
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:21,841
I attend your memorial service,
and cried the tears of a grieving widow.

262
00:24:22,008 --> 00:24:25,178
I vow I'll never get over you.
In fact, I never do.

263
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:28,598
I still carry your damn pictures
in my wallet!

264
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:34,938
Until one day, I pull into a gas station...

265
00:24:35,146 --> 00:24:39,150
...and you're alive with people chasing you
and you ask me to look at your butt?

266
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:43,321
That's kind of neat.
Rick's alive and he's shot in the butt.

267
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:47,784
Guess who's alive and shot in the butt?
Rick! I'm looking at his butt now!

268
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:50,328
You lying...

269
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:52,038
...gutless...

270
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:54,499
...son of a...

271
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,587
...yellow snodbugger, toad, bellybutton...

272
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,799
I can't think of enough awful things
to say about you, you bastard!

273
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,304
I guess that's a no on examining my butt.

274
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:11,517
- I'll get it. It's probably for me.
- You can't answer my phone.

275
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:13,560
Hello?

276
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:16,981
Yes. Fine. Taking a shower.

277
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,319
I'm coming home tomorrow.

278
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:23,779
Okay. 'Bye.

279
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:28,701
Same guy?

280
00:25:28,784 --> 00:25:31,954
- What guy?
- Harper. Jeremy III.

281
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:34,415
Rich boy, redneck asshole.
The one you married.

282
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:37,126
- You remember him?
- You know I got married?

283
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,587
Yeah. Four months after I disappeared.

284
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:42,840
That's pretty quick work
for a grieving widow.

285
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:44,550
Where were you?

286
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,596
- You could have waited to find out.
- I was lonely.

287
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,725
You were lonely
so you married the joke of the campus!

288
00:25:53,017 --> 00:25:56,187
Jerry the Napalm King.
How could you do that?

289
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:59,607
We had it wrong.
His family made laundry detergent.

290
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,236
- Cornwall Chemicals?
- No. Kitchen cleanser.

291
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:07,490
Don't kid yourself.
They were getting rich off the war.

292
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:11,036
The war? Was that it?
You were dodging the draft?

293
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,623
Or were you too gutless to tell me
you didn't want to marry me?

294
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,089
Are you all right?

295
00:26:22,673 --> 00:26:24,967
Yeah. I just feel a little woozy.

296
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,928
- I better call the doctor.
- No doctors.

297
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,888
Four Seasons Hotel.

298
00:26:29,972 --> 00:26:32,599
Is this the front desk?
Is there a pharmacy?

299
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,059
Yes, certainly.

300
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:37,688
Please send up gauze pads,
tape and hydrogen peroxide.

301
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:40,191
- Right away, Miss Graves.
- Thank you.

302
00:26:41,442 --> 00:26:44,904
All right. What's going on?

303
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,032
Was that a holdup
or is someone chasing you?

304
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,790
Got any kids?

305
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,169
It's just you've got that "Mom" tone.

306
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:04,882
I'm a lawyer. I have that lawyer tone.

307
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,343
I can help you.

308
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,555
Will you talk to me?

309
00:27:14,517 --> 00:27:15,602
Tomorrow.

310
00:27:18,813 --> 00:27:20,774
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

311
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,751
Good Lord.

312
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:43,297
Rick Jarmin's alive.

313
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,936
- How's it going?
- Any idea who did this?

314
00:27:57,019 --> 00:28:00,940
Maybe. I got a phone tip from
an eyewitness, said there was shooting...

315
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:03,901
...and a blue Beemer racing away
with a man and woman in it.

316
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:07,363
- We'll see what happens.
- Sarge, better take a look at this.

317
00:28:07,446 --> 00:28:08,698
See you later.

318
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:12,535
Here.

319
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:14,704
Thanks a lot.

320
00:28:23,755 --> 00:28:26,883
I have a right to be rude.
I left a message for him.

321
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,676
I waited for it and...

322
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,930
He picked it up. What time was that?

323
00:28:36,351 --> 00:28:38,853
I want to go above his head.

324
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:49,156
Try it by name. Try Bowers.

325
00:28:49,322 --> 00:28:51,992
- Billy Ray Bowers.
- No one by that name on our list.

326
00:28:52,075 --> 00:28:54,661
- No record of a Billy Ray Bowers?
- No, sir.

327
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,916
- Try Jean-Pierre Fouret.
- No, sir.

328
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,461
- Turnbull, Jodie.
- No.

329
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,422
- Carlson, Matthew.
- No, sir.

330
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:10,427
Try Jarmin, Richard.

331
00:29:10,511 --> 00:29:13,472
Rick Jarmin.
See if anybody by that name exists.

332
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:16,433
I'm sorry, sir. Have a nice day.

333
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:27,153
Something's gone wrong.

334
00:29:28,696 --> 00:29:30,740
I don't seem to exist anymore.

335
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:34,535
Expecting someone?

336
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,538
I have a standing order for breakfast
at 7:00 a.m.

337
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:41,042
- What time is it?
- 6:48.

338
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:44,879
You got a gun?
Of course you don't have a gun.

339
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,549
- You got any kind of weapon?
- No. It's my breakfast.

340
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:51,302
Marianne, get dressed.
Get dressed fast, please.

341
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:54,889
Yeah, we can make it.

342
00:29:54,973 --> 00:29:58,018
What do you mean "we"?
I'm not going out there!

343
00:29:58,435 --> 00:30:00,645
Four attempts have been made on my life.

344
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:03,148
If you open that door,
you could end up dead.

345
00:30:03,231 --> 00:30:06,902
Listen to me. We are at the top
of a veritable fortress.

346
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:09,905
Yes! Presidents, oil sheiks stay here.

347
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:13,242
Friends of Lee lacocca stay here.
George Harrison stays here.

348
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:16,954
Yes! Because it has the best security
money can buy. Don't be paranoid.

349
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:20,207
I hate to be an old woman,
but paranoid keeps me alive.

350
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,668
This guy comes every morning. Trust me.

351
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:26,005
- Got your breakfast, Miss Graves.
- What did you order?

352
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:28,924
- What did you order?
- I ordered...

353
00:30:29,008 --> 00:30:30,968
...grapefruit, croissant...

354
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,013
And what?

355
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:36,766
Prunes.

356
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,477
Ask him what he's got.

357
00:30:40,853 --> 00:30:44,440
- Go on, ask him. Bet he can't tell you.
- What's for breakfast?

358
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:47,735
Some kind of breads and fruits.

359
00:30:48,736 --> 00:30:51,614
I'll be right there.
Rick, pull up a chair, sit down.

360
00:30:51,697 --> 00:30:55,451
I'll share my prunes
and then you can tell me all about this.

361
00:30:56,536 --> 00:30:59,038
Don't take the chain off the door.

362
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:02,625
Rattle it like you'll take it off.
Make him think you'll take it off.

363
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:05,962
You mean like this? Is that good?

364
00:31:06,045 --> 00:31:07,964
Yeah. It's funny to you.

365
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,594
Oh, God!

366
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:17,933
- Get the mace!
- You get it!

367
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,603
The mace! The mace!

368
00:31:31,989 --> 00:31:33,198
Hurry up!

369
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:54,261
- Come on! Upstairs!
- Wait a minute! Get my purse.

370
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:00,810
- Hurry up!
- I can't do this, Rick.

371
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:04,480
What are you talking about?
This is what Lee lacocca does.

372
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:07,024
I'm very scared, Rick.

373
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,154
Since when did you start
wearing underpants?

374
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,994
Do I get to know what's going on
or do I get killed for old time's sake?

375
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:19,370
Follow me.

376
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:22,916
- I've got to know what's going on.
- So do I.

377
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,628
I'm supposedly being protected
by the federal government...

378
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,880
...but I think they're trying to do me in.

379
00:32:29,923 --> 00:32:33,009
- Who are those men?
- Ex drug-enforcement agents.

380
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:37,389
I sent one to jail and could send the other.
They want me and whoever's with me.

381
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:40,517
- Why?
- I testified against them. That's why.

382
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,936
- About what?
- It's a long story.

383
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,990
This is not a good time to talk about this.

384
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,035
Help!

385
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,210
My God!

386
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,602
Is that the VIP entrance?

387
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:25,062
Good morning. How are we doing today?

388
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:31,611
I'm so hungry!
We got to get out of this room.

389
00:33:31,694 --> 00:33:35,406
- It's too dangerous to go to the room.
- I've gotta change my clothes.

390
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,826
No! We'll buy some, okay?

391
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:40,245
If this isn't a dream, I'm in deep shit.

392
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,254
- You owe me an explanation.
- Get me out, I'll tell you everything.

393
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:53,175
No. Don't tell me.

394
00:33:53,258 --> 00:33:54,759
No keys.

395
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,057
Gotcha!

396
00:34:04,061 --> 00:34:07,564
- I ought to weenie-whip you!
- Get that weenie out of my face!

397
00:34:07,648 --> 00:34:08,899
Let's get outta here.

398
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:23,038
- How you doing over there?
- Great.

399
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:26,375
Tell me the story.

400
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:30,296
Remember when Jamie and I
got everybody to chip in...

401
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:35,301
...so we could go south
and score some real Acapulco gold?

402
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:38,971
I remember you borrowed his father's
plane so you could fly to Mexicali.

403
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:40,973
That's the last I ever heard from you.

404
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,976
It seemed simple.
Fly south, pick up a couple of keys.

405
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,729
But no, we were really impressed
with ourselves.

406
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:49,273
We started drinking,
shooting off at the mouth...

407
00:34:49,357 --> 00:34:53,069
...and before we knew it there was this guy
called Sorenson involved.

408
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:57,198
- Things just got a whole lot bigger.
- What a dumb-ass thing to do.

409
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,370
- You always did love being a big shot.
- You don't understand.

410
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:07,375
I understand. You were being
a couple of jerks like always.

411
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:10,545
Anything for a kick.
Anything to thumb your nose at authority.

412
00:35:10,629 --> 00:35:11,922
Your gold card.

413
00:35:12,005 --> 00:35:15,342
Where do you get off with that attitude?
"Rick Jarmin, asshole."

414
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:17,928
- Whatever happened to you?
- I got smart.

415
00:35:19,262 --> 00:35:21,974
Is that what you call being corrupted?
"Smart?"

416
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:26,436
- You know nothing about me.
- I got your number, baby.

417
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,205
We got a blue Beemer.

418
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:48,501
You're totally unchanged. I've never met
anybody more holier-than-thou.

419
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:52,588
Tell me something honestly.
Do you ever donate anything to the poor?

420
00:35:52,672 --> 00:35:55,883
Or do you and Jerry the Napalm King
hoard your millions?

421
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,136
- Laundry detergent!
- Yeah, we had it wrong.

422
00:35:58,219 --> 00:36:01,097
Yes. We're very rich
and we hoard our millions.

423
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,100
Occasionally we invite a poor person in
for Thanksgiving.

424
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:08,354
Feed him nothing. We eat turkey
in front of him and watch him starve.

425
00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:11,107
- Can I drop you somewhere?
- Yeah. Wisconsin.

426
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:14,235
- Wisconsin?
- Yeah. Racine, Wisconsin.

427
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:18,448
I've got to find Lou Baird. He's the one
I can trust to get me back into hiding.

428
00:36:18,531 --> 00:36:22,744
- What's he doing in Wisconsin?
- He's not. He's in St. Louis.

429
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:26,706
I'm with Rick Jarmin again.
The hand is quicker than the eye.

430
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,500
My address book is in Wisconsin.

431
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:31,336
His sister is there,
and I think that's where he retired.

432
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,047
I don't think you're
in any witness-relocation program.

433
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:36,800
You're some two-bit criminal
being chased by the police.

434
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,053
- You don't mean that.
- Or you can't pay your gambling debts.

435
00:36:40,137 --> 00:36:44,475
- You dressed it up with this FBI crap.
- Wisconsin is only six hours away.

436
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:47,269
- I have a life.
- But are you happy?

437
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:51,065
- I'm expected home.
- Hands on the dashboard. Don't move.

438
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:56,737
- Get that gun out of my face.
- You have the right to an attorney.

439
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,781
I am an attorney, damn it!

440
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:01,367
- Are you Billy Ray Bowers?
- What's he charged with?

441
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,203
You're both charged
with the killing of Marvin Marsent.

442
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:06,414
You were identified
at the scene of the crime.

443
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:08,374
Rick, tell them.

444
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,460
- What?
- About the witness relocation program.

445
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:16,424
- You'll have time to tell us in jail.
- Put both hands behind your head.

446
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,014
Drive!

447
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:28,603
Get in the car!

448
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,358
Shut up and steer the damn thing!

449
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:36,319
- Did you kill the guy?
- No, I loved him. They killed him.

450
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:38,321
Then you can plead innocent!

451
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:42,325
I never will. They'll kill me before
I get a chance. The same goes for you.

452
00:38:01,303 --> 00:38:02,763
Get your foot off!

453
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:10,562
Shit! Oh, God!

454
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,198
You're gonna break my legs!

455
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:24,368
Stop squealing!

456
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:39,050
Watch where you're going.
Go north as soon as you can.

457
00:38:39,342 --> 00:38:41,469
Get your face off my gas!

458
00:38:44,305 --> 00:38:45,431
Shit!

459
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,060
This can't be good for you.

460
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:55,108
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking your place. Move over.

461
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:58,653
This is a rented car.
We can get in trouble if you drive it.

462
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,990
- You're worried about Hertz? Move!
- Give me my wheel!

463
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,285
You'll get us both killed.

464
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:12,501
Move over!

465
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,631
Jesus!

466
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:30,436
- I think we lost them.
- Where are we?

467
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,770
They're not there anymore.

468
00:39:31,854 --> 00:39:34,940
- We're in the railway tunnel.
- Where the hell are we?

469
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:38,736
Shit!

470
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,209
Back up!

471
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:09,642
I don't know. Stuck.

472
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,960
Goddamn!

473
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,050
What are you doing?
You almost got us killed!

474
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:42,968
I did you a favor.

475
00:40:43,677 --> 00:40:45,804
Are you having fun or something?

476
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:50,267
I can't believe when you pulled...

477
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,478
You were great back there.

478
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,480
I was so scared!

479
00:40:55,689 --> 00:40:58,734
You'll love it in Racine.
It's a happening town.

480
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:02,947
The car was rented by Marianne Graves,
a lawyer from New York.

481
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,492
How she got involved, I don't know,
but I don't like it.

482
00:41:06,576 --> 00:41:08,035
Call it kidnapping.

483
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:11,247
He'll kill her the same way
he killed his boss at the gas station.

484
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,042
I don't like all this killing.
Erasing a witness...

485
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:17,003
You're not trying to back out on us,
are you?

486
00:41:17,295 --> 00:41:18,880
Not a good idea, Joe.

487
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:21,966
Please don't smoke.

488
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:26,805
We would hate to inform authorities
that 20 years ago you were responsible...

489
00:41:26,888 --> 00:41:30,850
...for selling confiscated narcotics out
of the back door of the police warehouse.

490
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:34,896
Yeah, Joe. Especially now
that you've got yourself such a big career.

491
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:35,981
Relax.

492
00:41:36,064 --> 00:41:40,402
I'm doing everything I can. I've used
the kidnapping to bring the FBI in.

493
00:41:40,485 --> 00:41:43,989
We're plugged into the woman's
phone lines, credit cards, bank account.

494
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:46,241
Auto club. They're bound to surface.

495
00:41:46,325 --> 00:41:50,829
When they do, Jarmin will either be shot
or wind up in prison. Then he's yours.

496
00:41:50,913 --> 00:41:53,123
We're looking forward to that, Joe.

497
00:41:54,625 --> 00:41:55,751
What a pro.

498
00:42:52,642 --> 00:42:54,853
Hundreds! That's all you carry.

499
00:43:34,018 --> 00:43:35,645
Where are we now?

500
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,273
Shortcut.

501
00:43:46,781 --> 00:43:48,366
What's the matter?

502
00:43:48,658 --> 00:43:49,826
Nothing.

503
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:56,499
I never told you, Jamie's dead.

504
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:00,754
God!

505
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:03,548
He was killed by Sorenson and Diggs.

506
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,969
They were two drug enforcement agents,
corrupt ones.

507
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:13,058
They busted Jamie and me
for the nickel bags we bought...

508
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:17,270
...and told us we'd rot injail
if we didn't do exactly what they said.

509
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,106
One minute we were kids...

510
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,609
...and the next we were trapped
in the middle of a major drug deal.

511
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,444
They needed our plane.

512
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:29,908
They made us fly under the radar
to an unmarked airstrip on the US side...

513
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:32,536
...and that's where all hell broke loose.

514
00:44:32,953 --> 00:44:36,081
Diggs and Sorenson must've been
under government surveillance...

515
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:39,627
...'cause there were a lot of cops
waiting for us when we landed.

516
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,506
Sorenson came out shooting.
He killed one of the border patrol guys.

517
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:45,508
He wounded another one.

518
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,094
Diggs, however, got away.

519
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:51,097
Me and Jamie figured
we could bring Sorenson down...

520
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,641
...before he killed anybody else.

521
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,395
We were wrong.
Jamie got it point blank in the chest.

522
00:45:06,946 --> 00:45:09,282
I spent three months in a Mexicali jail...

523
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:12,118
...before the FBI
finally offered me immunity...

524
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:16,539
...for testifying against
Diggs and Sorenson.

525
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,045
That's when I joined
the Witness Relocation Program.

526
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,424
It's been fun ever since.

527
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:29,219
Why didn't you call me?

528
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:33,849
I didn't want to get you involved.

529
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:38,729
You were about to march up
to the altar anyway, so I let it lie.

530
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:56,705
This is it?

531
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:59,875
I think this is it. It's all changed around.

532
00:45:59,959 --> 00:46:04,672
Yeah, this is it.
It better be here or I'm in deep shit.

533
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:06,924
I'm going to look for a bathroom.

534
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:10,636
Have any change
so I can get to the VA hospital?

535
00:46:10,928 --> 00:46:12,054
Hold up.

536
00:46:13,973 --> 00:46:16,642
- Be right with you, pal.
- What do you need?

537
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:19,061
- What've you got?
- What are you doing?

538
00:46:19,395 --> 00:46:21,147
That's all you've got.

539
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,857
Here, brother.

540
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,652
- Have three squares on me.
- This all you've got?

541
00:46:25,735 --> 00:46:28,738
- How dare you do a thing like that!
- The guy's hungry.

542
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:31,616
That's for me to decide! That's my money!

543
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:35,578
- You've got plenty. What's the problem?
- I worked hard for it, damn it!

544
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:39,207
You couldn't carry something smaller?
Why do you carry hundreds? Status?

545
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:41,209
No! Emergency.

546
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:43,962
- This was an emergency.
- But it wasn't my emergency.

547
00:46:44,045 --> 00:46:47,674
It's that attitude that keeps half the people
in this world starving.

548
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:49,843
I don't see you feeding the poor!

549
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:51,553
What did you just see?

550
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,764
You're such a jackass!

551
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:55,057
Am I?

552
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:57,184
Mattie?

553
00:46:57,267 --> 00:47:00,270
Mattie Carlson? My God!

554
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:03,816
- Mattie?
- I've got to talk to you.

555
00:47:06,944 --> 00:47:10,406
When I left my job here,
I owed this guy a lot of money.

556
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:11,573
Hi.

557
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:15,494
You won't believe who's here!
It's Mad Mattie Carlson!

558
00:47:16,245 --> 00:47:19,123
- Can you wait in the car? Could get ugly.
- Don't tell me.

559
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:21,459
I must talk to you.

560
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:23,294
You were a hairdresser?

561
00:47:27,423 --> 00:47:30,509
You don't get a lot of choice
in the relocation game.

562
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:36,099
I can't believe it!

563
00:47:36,974 --> 00:47:41,396
Raun is gonna shit! He's gonna die!
I can't believe it!

564
00:47:44,357 --> 00:47:48,236
Can't say hi to an old friend?
Cat got your tongue?

565
00:47:48,945 --> 00:47:50,447
Say something!

566
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:52,907
Hi, Scotty.

567
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:54,242
Hiya, babe.

568
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,834
I can't believe you came back!

569
00:48:02,918 --> 00:48:04,544
- How are you?
- Great.

570
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:06,463
I like the...

571
00:48:06,546 --> 00:48:09,508
That? It's just dirty. I had to tie it up.

572
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:11,385
- Gorgeous.
- Who's this?

573
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:12,970
This is my sister.

574
00:48:13,053 --> 00:48:14,972
Hi. Come on. Let's go see Raun.

575
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:17,558
- He's dying to see you!
- I'll bet he is.

576
00:48:17,641 --> 00:48:21,687
Your brother is a genius! Michelangelo
of hair. I'm not exaggerating!

577
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,856
We lost half our clientele when he left.

578
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:26,775
He left on his lunch break.
Can you believe it?

579
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:28,777
Bread and butter!

580
00:48:29,278 --> 00:48:31,530
- Silly girl.
- He always does my hair.

581
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:35,242
Are you coming back?
You'll have to pay Raun what you owe him.

582
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:37,495
- Raun, look who's back.
- Hi, Raun.

583
00:48:39,747 --> 00:48:41,290
Hello, Matthew.

584
00:48:41,791 --> 00:48:44,085
I'll bet you're surprised to see me.

585
00:48:44,377 --> 00:48:47,255
You've lost weight. Your hair!
You look 10 years younger!

586
00:48:47,338 --> 00:48:49,799
Cut the crap. You've been a bad boy.

587
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:51,968
I know. Mea culpa.

588
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:53,803
And sic semper tyrannis.

589
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:56,973
You're so right. But I've come
to pay you back what I owe you.

590
00:48:57,056 --> 00:48:59,267
Will wonders never cease?

591
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:04,105
- You still have my things, my address...
- Show me cash, I'll show you the book.

592
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:06,566
Could you hang on a minute?

593
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,611
- This is funny to you?
- Yes.

594
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,322
I need $2,000 cash.

595
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:15,575
Isn't it nice one of us
became a materialistic being?

596
00:49:15,867 --> 00:49:18,954
- Can you help me, please?
- What's in it for me?

597
00:49:19,663 --> 00:49:24,251
If I get the book, I can get to Lou Baird
and pay you back quicker.

598
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:26,962
If I don't get the book,
you might be stuck with me.

599
00:49:27,045 --> 00:49:28,380
How's that?

600
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:32,718
Who do I make the check out to?

601
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:36,305
I'm supposed to believe
your check is good? I want cash!

602
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:38,557
- The bank's over there.
- I'll get the book?

603
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,103
We'll discuss it when I see cash.
And then I'll want an apology.

604
00:49:43,187 --> 00:49:45,564
Then you can do my hair.

605
00:49:45,648 --> 00:49:49,360
- Why mess with perfection?
- Rick, it's only fair!

606
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,695
- Who is this?
- His sister.

607
00:49:52,196 --> 00:49:55,616
- She called him Rick.
- I called him sick.

608
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:57,410
He is sick!

609
00:49:57,493 --> 00:50:01,080
Cash. Apology. Hair.

610
00:50:01,163 --> 00:50:03,624
In that order. I'll be waiting.

611
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:06,002
Driver's license and three IDs.

612
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:08,129
Credit cards do?

613
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,718
Break.

614
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,229
Where'd he go?

615
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,648
- Stall them.
- I'm not stalling them.

616
00:50:29,442 --> 00:50:30,276
Sir?

617
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,280
- What's going on? Can you step on it?
- Certainly.

618
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,406
Right.

619
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,491
Take what you want.

620
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:39,452
- What are you doing?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

621
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,372
- Here.
- You've got the wrong idea.

622
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:43,874
Freeze!

623
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,668
Don't move!

624
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,339
Put your arms up.

625
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,676
Down on the floor!

626
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,806
- My credit cards!
- Forget about the credit cards!

627
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:04,561
Just let me get my gold card.
Please? Just let me...

628
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:06,397
Stay down or the girl gets it!

629
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:10,109
- My purse!
- Come here!

630
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:26,209
- What's going on?
- Step across the street, please.

631
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:27,710
Sure.

632
00:51:36,678 --> 00:51:38,388
I'm not going with you!

633
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:42,767
You've got no choice. They're after you,
too, and it's not just the cops.

634
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:46,104
What am I supposed to do?
Spend my life running like you?

635
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:47,897
Well, it's up to you.

636
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:52,652
We're dead if they catch us.
Now hop aboard or say good-bye.

637
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:56,031
Come on.

638
00:52:01,286 --> 00:52:02,829
So long, tough guy.

639
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:05,332
So long.

640
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:08,835
What are you doing?

641
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:29,190
This is the car. Lieberman?

642
00:52:29,398 --> 00:52:32,151
Cover the rear. Take McCurrin with you.

643
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,362
Check out everything.

644
00:52:34,445 --> 00:52:36,030
Yes, sir, I got it.

645
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,450
- Cover all the stores.
- Right.

646
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,498
- Get this towed out of here.
- Yes, sir.

647
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,166
Cover all the stores.

648
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:55,884
What the hell am I doing?

649
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:57,677
Hop on!

650
00:52:57,969 --> 00:53:00,388
- What are you doing here?
- I missed you.

651
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:05,018
- You okay?
- Why are we going back?

652
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:06,561
I forgot something.

653
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:15,946
Raun wants to play!

654
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:32,421
- What is this? Butch on wheels?
- Here's your cash. Give me the book.

655
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:34,631
It's more than you need.
Give me the book!

656
00:53:34,715 --> 00:53:36,008
Take me with you!

657
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,969
- This town needs you.
- Cut the crap. Let's get out of here.

658
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:41,889
That ought to be enough
to cover the damages.

659
00:53:41,972 --> 00:53:43,390
What damages?

660
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:03,327
Shit.

661
00:54:05,038 --> 00:54:05,872
Hang on.

662
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,124
Look out!

663
00:54:12,253 --> 00:54:15,089
I have the suspect in sight
and I am in pursuit.

664
00:54:19,677 --> 00:54:20,762
Hang on.

665
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:23,556
Get out of the way!

666
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:30,021
I'm following suspect. I am in pursuit.

667
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:35,402
Watch out!

668
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:49,500
I almost have them. I am in pursuit.

669
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,602
What are you doing
with your face in my sidewalk?

670
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:10,438
I am no longer in pursuit.

671
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:31,626
- Can you step on it? I'm in a hurry.
- I'm going as quickly as I can!

672
00:55:31,709 --> 00:55:35,296
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!
Don't move. Put your hands up.

673
00:55:35,672 --> 00:55:37,215
On the floor now!

674
00:55:38,883 --> 00:55:42,429
Looks like she's there of her own free will.
Look at this part.

675
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:44,097
Will you come here?

676
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:48,185
She tried to go back for the money
when her boyfriend wanted out.

677
00:55:48,268 --> 00:55:52,105
He's not her boyfriend. Can we
get that straight? I am her boyfriend.

678
00:55:52,189 --> 00:55:57,194
She's not a kidnap victim, so the FBI
is out of it. It's up to local authorities.

679
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:02,199
Hi, Joe. This is Paul Bernhardt.
Joe Weyburn. He works here.

680
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,619
Any theories as to how to head them off?

681
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,039
He obviously used to work at this mall.

682
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,127
Maybe going back to a place
of employment is a pattern.

683
00:56:13,627 --> 00:56:17,798
Without a record of previous employment,
we can only wait and see.

684
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:19,550
Keep on it.

685
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:21,218
Mr. Bernhardt.

686
00:56:41,906 --> 00:56:44,534
"Matthew Carlson, Raun's of Racine."

687
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,082
"Jodie Turnbull, Muncie Farms."

688
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,838
Yeah!

689
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,924
Tell him Rick Jarmin
needs to speak to him.

690
00:57:00,008 --> 00:57:02,177
I need to. It's urgent, okay?

691
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,430
Jarmin. J-A-R-M-l-N.

692
00:57:06,264 --> 00:57:08,100
Not till when?

693
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,228
6:00 p.m.? On the dot, ma'am.

694
00:57:12,646 --> 00:57:14,231
Okay, thanks for...

695
00:57:14,523 --> 00:57:16,692
Yeah. He'll remember me.

696
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,778
Believe me, he'll remember me.
Thanks again.

697
00:57:19,945 --> 00:57:21,113
'Bye, ma'am.

698
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:23,615
Hallelujah!

699
00:57:24,324 --> 00:57:27,244
He's there. Not till 6:00, but he's there.

700
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,830
He had to go to the doctor. Demon out!

701
00:57:30,956 --> 00:57:33,542
He's got a job in the zoo.
He got me a job there once.

702
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,045
Did I tell you about
when I worked at the zoo...

703
00:57:36,128 --> 00:57:39,799
I don't wish to hear about the zoo.
I wish to get out of these bushes.

704
00:57:39,882 --> 00:57:44,470
I'm wearing cashmere in 100degrees heat.
I don't feel like waiting till 6:00.

705
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:46,430
- Well...
- Yeah?

706
00:57:46,514 --> 00:57:48,975
I know someplace we can go.
It's on the way.

707
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:51,602
If you don't mind riding for a couple hours.

708
00:57:51,686 --> 00:57:53,604
- Think you can do that?
- Yeah.

709
00:57:55,189 --> 00:57:58,234
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

710
00:57:58,317 --> 00:58:01,237
Either say it or don't say it, all right?

711
00:58:40,486 --> 00:58:41,779
Rise and shine.

712
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,786
- I need a night's sleep.
- Ace!

713
00:58:49,078 --> 00:58:50,246
Come here.

714
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:54,708
You son of a bitch. You're still alive.

715
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:58,170
Hopefully she'll get better
when she's had the operation.

716
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:00,506
Jodie?

717
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:04,051
Rach. How are ya?

718
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:07,638
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- I guess you're surprised to see me.

719
00:59:07,722 --> 00:59:10,308
- You look great.
- Talk about dropping out of the blue.

720
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:12,810
This guy built half this place
and disappeared.

721
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:15,146
I'm sorry, this is Marianne Graves.

722
00:59:15,229 --> 00:59:17,815
- This is Dr. Rachel Varney.
- Hello.

723
00:59:19,067 --> 00:59:21,277
- You used to work here?
- Yeah.

724
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,238
I was a carpenter and a general...

725
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:26,407
Pilot, designer, everything.
And then just one day, gone.

726
00:59:26,491 --> 00:59:29,119
I'm sorry about that.
I had to leave in a hurry.

727
00:59:29,202 --> 00:59:31,329
A man was looking for you after you left.

728
00:59:31,413 --> 00:59:34,374
He's still looking for me.

729
00:59:34,457 --> 00:59:37,544
- What happened?
- Shot me in the butt.

730
00:59:37,919 --> 00:59:40,589
Quite a game of tag you two play.
Let me see.

731
00:59:40,672 --> 00:59:43,258
It's just a little buckshot.
It went straight through.

732
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:46,470
Not if it's bleeding. Let me take a look.
Take your pants down.

733
00:59:46,553 --> 00:59:47,929
Not out here.

734
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,475
What are you, shy? I've seen it before.

735
00:59:55,187 --> 00:59:57,105
I'm sorry. Are you his wife?

736
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:02,444
Are you kidding? No way.

737
01:00:02,528 --> 01:00:06,031
You two just go ahead and whatever.
I'll call a cab.

738
01:00:06,115 --> 01:00:08,659
That's not a good idea.
She's insane with fatigue.

739
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:10,828
She needs something to eat,
a bed and a bath.

740
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:12,329
I'm sorry.

741
01:00:12,413 --> 01:00:15,666
You can use the guest house
to wash up and sleep.

742
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,419
- Jodie, can you stay the night?
- I don't know.

743
01:00:18,711 --> 01:00:21,589
Go ahead, Rick. Be a sport.

744
01:00:21,672 --> 01:00:24,800
- She always calls me Rick.
- I won't get in your way.

745
01:00:24,884 --> 01:00:27,637
- It's not like that, really.
- Yes, it is.

746
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:30,348
- It was.
- It was.

747
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:34,060
He picked me up, put me back on my feet.
Showed me how to do everything.

748
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:37,105
- I bet he did.
- You should see the barn.

749
01:00:37,188 --> 01:00:40,066
It all worked.
Every single idea you had worked.

750
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:43,236
- The big animal practice is back there.
- Takes one to know one.

751
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:46,531
- The horse sling's wonderful. Want to see?
- Yeah. Let's go.

752
01:00:46,614 --> 01:00:49,617
- You never saw anything work.
- I never knew it would.

753
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:51,578
- It did.
- Marianne, come on.

754
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:54,998
I'm sure she doesn't want to bother.
She's exhausted.

755
01:00:56,708 --> 01:00:59,044
I'd like to see that horse sling.

756
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:04,508
"Heigh-ho, Silver!" Look at that.

757
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:08,178
Isn't that wild? They thought it was nuts
when I showed them the plans.

758
01:01:08,262 --> 01:01:10,472
I thought it was nuts when I did them.

759
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,057
Come see this.

760
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:21,400
- It works great.
- It works.

761
01:01:21,483 --> 01:01:23,402
- Nice job.
- I'm a genius.

762
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:26,822
We'll let the inventor use his table.
Drop 'em and hop up.

763
01:01:27,948 --> 01:01:30,701
- Do you need her to leave?
- I'll stay.

764
01:01:31,202 --> 01:01:32,953
I've seen it before, too.

765
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:35,289
Great. You can assist.

766
01:01:35,373 --> 01:01:38,709
Get the peroxide and sponges
from the cabinets over there.

767
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:42,797
Come on. Take your pants off
and get on the table.

768
01:01:43,631 --> 01:01:47,093
- Come on. Don't be a baby.
- Be gentle with me, okay?

769
01:01:47,635 --> 01:01:49,262
I'll think about it.

770
01:01:49,762 --> 01:01:51,055
I'll be gentle.

771
01:01:55,768 --> 01:01:56,895
That's cold.

772
01:01:56,978 --> 01:01:59,355
The cows never seem to mind.

773
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:02,108
- Roll over.
- Roll over.

774
01:02:02,192 --> 01:02:03,693
Do I get a Milkbone?

775
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:09,658
What did you have in mind?

776
01:02:09,741 --> 01:02:11,660
Let's take a look.

777
01:02:17,707 --> 01:02:21,002
- How is it?
- Not bad, but it's not great. Clean it up.

778
01:02:22,504 --> 01:02:24,423
- What's that?
- I don't know.

779
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:29,344
Sulfuric acid.

780
01:02:33,724 --> 01:02:35,309
What are you doin'?

781
01:02:35,976 --> 01:02:37,519
I hate those things.

782
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,314
- You okay?
- Fine.

783
01:02:41,273 --> 01:02:42,858
- Feel that?
- Feel what?

784
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:45,653
- There it is.
- What?

785
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:52,743
Sponge.

786
01:03:01,002 --> 01:03:04,046
- I think you need a little fresh air.
- No, I'm fine.

787
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,966
I'll send your cowboy right out.

788
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,469
Maybe just a whiff will help me.

789
01:03:11,846 --> 01:03:14,682
She's tired,
and she needs something to eat, too.

790
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:18,853
So, who is she?

791
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,731
- She's just an old friend.
- Yeah, right.

792
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:24,150
- Really. An old friend.
- Are you sure about that?

793
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:27,404
When you got a knife up my ass, I am.

794
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,532
How bad is it,
this "thing" you're running from?

795
01:03:30,615 --> 01:03:31,825
Pretty bad.

796
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:35,662
Think you'd ever beat it
and want to come back here someday?

797
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:37,664
If I could beat it, I'd go anywhere.

798
01:03:37,748 --> 01:03:40,500
I'm asking because
I'm engaged to be married.

799
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:43,128
"Flagellations." That's great.

800
01:03:43,211 --> 01:03:45,464
I'd rethink it...

801
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:48,926
...if I thought you might
come back this way someday.

802
01:03:50,886 --> 01:03:53,639
You always were direct, Rachel.

803
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:57,059
- You're done.
- Thanks.

804
01:04:02,022 --> 01:04:03,566
How long have I got?

805
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:06,986
The wedding's on Sunday.

806
01:04:10,698 --> 01:04:12,950
I'm a bad bet, you know.

807
01:04:13,826 --> 01:04:15,286
Much happiness. Come here.

808
01:04:24,545 --> 01:04:26,506
Excuse me for a minute.

809
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:32,053
You never hustled like that
when I was angry.

810
01:04:36,683 --> 01:04:38,017
Are you okay?

811
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:40,145
- Forget it.
- Forget what?

812
01:04:40,228 --> 01:04:43,857
I need a phone to get out of here
so you two can live happily ever after.

813
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,067
It's not like that. She was...

814
01:04:46,151 --> 01:04:48,361
In your arms and you were naked. I saw it.

815
01:04:48,445 --> 01:04:50,947
- It's nothing.
- And my name is Dumbo. Who cares?

816
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:53,033
What's it to you? Why should you care?

817
01:04:53,116 --> 01:04:55,535
- You're happily married, yeah?
- I'm not.

818
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,290
- You're not happy?
- Not married.

819
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:02,292
- No?
- It just didn't work out.

820
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:05,295
He was a prick.
You're better off without him.

821
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:10,426
My heart can't take this again.

822
01:05:14,054 --> 01:05:16,307
Remember the time I saw
that flying saucer?

823
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:19,393
We were smoking
some pretty heavy stuff back then.

824
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:22,480
I think I see another one.

825
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:32,031
What's that?

826
01:06:13,657 --> 01:06:15,200
Friends of yours?

827
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:29,590
- Go! I'll stay here.
- Right.

828
01:06:30,382 --> 01:06:32,051
Let's get out of here!

829
01:06:32,134 --> 01:06:34,511
- 'Bye, Rach. Thanks a lot.
- I'll cover you.

830
01:06:47,692 --> 01:06:48,818
Let's fly.

831
01:06:50,278 --> 01:06:51,737
I'm gonna kill you!

832
01:07:08,463 --> 01:07:11,132
- Hurry up, Rick!
- Ready for this?

833
01:07:11,424 --> 01:07:13,051
Tie down your toupee.

834
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:44,083
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- This is as fast as it goes!

835
01:07:53,092 --> 01:07:54,218
Hang on!

836
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:35,719
Oh, my God!

837
01:08:44,561 --> 01:08:46,104
I'm gonna throw up!

838
01:08:46,396 --> 01:08:48,732
I'm not kidding!

839
01:08:54,988 --> 01:08:58,700
- Are you crazy? What are you doing?
- I gotta take his rotor out.

840
01:09:03,414 --> 01:09:05,207
- What the hell?
- What's he doing?

841
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,668
Slow down! He's cutting up the rotor!

842
01:09:09,795 --> 01:09:11,046
We're goin' down!

843
01:09:34,612 --> 01:09:36,823
If you've got a belt, put it on.

844
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,659
And stick your head between your knees.

845
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,704
- What do I do now?
- Kiss your ass good-bye.

846
01:09:42,787 --> 01:09:45,248
We got no wheels and we're comin' down.

847
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,006
I don't want to die!

848
01:10:03,225 --> 01:10:04,893
Are we dead?

849
01:10:06,603 --> 01:10:07,646
No.

850
01:10:08,272 --> 01:10:12,276
But we will be if we don't get out of here.
This can't be good for you.

851
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:13,652
Help me.

852
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:18,657
Hang on.

853
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:26,874
Let's go. This thing still might blow up.

854
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:29,460
It's been five years.
I haven't lost my touch.

855
01:10:29,543 --> 01:10:31,962
It's like riding a bicycle.
You never forget it.

856
01:10:33,923 --> 01:10:35,925
I can't take this anymore.

857
01:10:37,426 --> 01:10:39,929
I'm gonna go on the road and hitchhike.

858
01:10:40,846 --> 01:10:43,266
I don't care if they catch us and we die.

859
01:10:43,349 --> 01:10:46,477
I need food. I need a bath.

860
01:10:47,437 --> 01:10:48,980
I need a bed.

861
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:51,816
I need a massage.

862
01:10:54,694 --> 01:10:58,907
I need a manicure.
I need to see my therapist.

863
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:02,118
I need a beer. Look at that.

864
01:11:02,202 --> 01:11:03,953
It's the promised land.

865
01:11:04,454 --> 01:11:06,790
We have no money and no credit cards.

866
01:11:07,165 --> 01:11:09,209
I'll talk to the guy in charge.

867
01:11:10,126 --> 01:11:12,045
Give him this.

868
01:11:12,128 --> 01:11:14,589
- Give him my watch.
- Hold me down.

869
01:11:16,424 --> 01:11:18,885
If they don't take that, sell my body.

870
01:11:21,972 --> 01:11:23,890
I don't care.

871
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:15,818
I'll try and get there
early afternoon tomorrow.

872
01:12:15,902 --> 01:12:17,278
Thank you. 'Bye.

873
01:12:18,029 --> 01:12:20,657
Right here. Hallway.
See you in the morning.

874
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,450
Tomorrow at 7:30, before you know it.

875
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:24,494
- Thanks, Norman.
- Good night.

876
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:27,330
Hiya, pooch.

877
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:33,295
- Marianne, are you in this one?
- There's no lock and no door handle.

878
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:35,464
Watch the door. It falls of the hinges.

879
01:12:35,547 --> 01:12:39,092
Why didn't you choose another one?
The guy said, "Take your pick."

880
01:12:39,176 --> 01:12:42,638
- The only one with a TV.
- So there is. Civilization.

881
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:44,640
I wonder if we're on the news.

882
01:12:44,723 --> 01:12:45,849
Shit!

883
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:48,894
There was nothing good on anyway.

884
01:12:54,024 --> 01:12:56,485
I've just taken a shower.

885
01:12:57,194 --> 01:12:59,154
I'm wearing a towel.

886
01:13:00,614 --> 01:13:02,408
I'm hanging up my clothes.

887
01:13:02,908 --> 01:13:04,994
This is interesting narration.

888
01:13:17,423 --> 01:13:19,675
I'd appreciate your not watching me.

889
01:13:19,759 --> 01:13:21,761
There's nothing else to watch.

890
01:13:22,637 --> 01:13:25,390
Speaking of watches, I've still got yours.

891
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:28,643
I didn't give it to the guy.
We'll need it tomorrow anyway.

892
01:13:28,726 --> 01:13:31,062
We'll have to get a car or something.

893
01:13:31,938 --> 01:13:34,691
Lou Baird said he wants to see me
in person.

894
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,446
I was talking to his sister.
I tried to tell her the problem.

895
01:13:39,988 --> 01:13:43,116
But she said it wasn't a good idea
to discuss it on the phone.

896
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,118
- Why?
- I don't know.

897
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:47,954
- Was the phone tapped or something?
- God.

898
01:13:48,038 --> 01:13:50,332
I knew you'd say that. I hope not.

899
01:13:50,624 --> 01:13:52,918
Don't go there. Call the police.

900
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,670
You know I can't do that.

901
01:13:55,754 --> 01:13:59,007
Why are you so paranoid about the police?
They can help you.

902
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:02,177
I'm half a day's drive away
from Lou Baird's. I'm not going...

903
01:14:02,261 --> 01:14:04,429
How do you know
he's not part of the setup?

904
01:14:04,513 --> 01:14:05,973
Because he isn't.

905
01:14:06,056 --> 01:14:09,393
He's saved my hide too many times
to want to kill me now.

906
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:12,730
Tomorrow morning,
we'll find the nearest town...

907
01:14:12,813 --> 01:14:16,984
...swap your watch for some old junker,
and everything will be just fine.

908
01:14:17,067 --> 01:14:20,196
I know what I'm doing.
Have you got a towel?

909
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:23,365
That's not a towel.

910
01:14:23,449 --> 01:14:27,286
- Who's gonna pay for this hotel room?
- They need a chambermaid.

911
01:14:28,579 --> 01:14:30,998
- A chambermaid?
- I'll help you.

912
01:14:31,082 --> 01:14:33,834
It's only 12 units.
It won't take us very long.

913
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:38,089
- Are you mumbling? What are you doing?
- Good luck.

914
01:14:38,172 --> 01:14:41,217
- I'm out of here in the morning.
- I gave this guy my word.

915
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,137
I didn't, all right?
I'll call my office in the morning...

916
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,806
...have them express mail some money,
pay the guy off.

917
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:50,518
I'll buy this goddamn place,
if necessary, and I'm out of here.

918
01:14:50,768 --> 01:14:53,104
- Calm down. What's eating you?
- Calm down?

919
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:57,150
I just took a shower with a cockroach
from hell. He's doing his hair now.

920
01:14:57,233 --> 01:15:00,362
Not to mention that you've sold me
into human bondage.

921
01:15:04,115 --> 01:15:06,368
- You really are spoiled.
- Yes, I am.

922
01:15:06,451 --> 01:15:09,287
Then being a chambermaid
might do you some good.

923
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:10,705
God!

924
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:12,541
- Stop that shit.
- What shit?

925
01:15:12,624 --> 01:15:14,501
That mumbling
has always driven me crazy.

926
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:17,963
Did you ever wonder why we got together
in the first place?

927
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:22,176
Do we ever agree on anything?
Did your personality ever not annoy me?

928
01:15:22,593 --> 01:15:24,094
- Sex.
- Sex.

929
01:15:24,178 --> 01:15:26,513
- I really don't remember.
- You really don't?

930
01:15:26,597 --> 01:15:28,140
I don't think you do either.

931
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:31,518
I think this is a cheap trick
'cause I'm getting into bed with you.

932
01:15:31,602 --> 01:15:34,897
- I wouldn't worry about me.
- Anyway, I have a boyfriend.

933
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,942
A very wonderful boyfriend.

934
01:15:47,368 --> 01:15:50,079
- Who's this boyfriend?
- How'd I know you'd ask me that?

935
01:15:50,162 --> 01:15:52,373
- Why shouldn't I?
- You'll just belittle him.

936
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:54,292
- I would not.
- You will. I know you.

937
01:15:54,375 --> 01:15:55,793
Have it your way.

938
01:15:56,002 --> 01:15:58,087
- Please stay above the covers.
- Why?

939
01:15:58,171 --> 01:16:00,757
My towel is wet. I have to get out of it.

940
01:16:01,466 --> 01:16:02,675
I guess so.

941
01:16:02,759 --> 01:16:04,427
That's better.

942
01:16:05,303 --> 01:16:06,596
Thank you.

943
01:16:11,184 --> 01:16:14,229
Tell me about this boyfriend.
What's he like in the sack?

944
01:16:14,312 --> 01:16:16,022
Can he thrill the lake?

945
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:20,652
I'm not discussing sex with you tonight.

946
01:16:25,574 --> 01:16:28,201
I haven't had a girlfriend in five years.

947
01:16:30,412 --> 01:16:31,830
- Really?
- Yeah.

948
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:35,584
Mr. Wiggly's been on bread and water
for five long years.

949
01:16:42,132 --> 01:16:44,051
- Is that the truth?
- Yeah.

950
01:16:44,176 --> 01:16:46,512
I didn't think it would be fair.

951
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:51,642
You cold?

952
01:16:52,851 --> 01:16:53,978
Not really.

953
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:02,486
Feels familiar, doesn't it?

954
01:17:03,154 --> 01:17:05,615
Thought you said you didn't remember.

955
01:17:07,658 --> 01:17:10,119
I feel kind of selfish under here.

956
01:17:10,453 --> 01:17:13,539
You are very selfish,
and not just under there.

957
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:17,210
- Too bad you said that.
- Why?

958
01:17:18,586 --> 01:17:21,005
I was actually beginning to get turned on.

959
01:17:21,089 --> 01:17:23,633
- Too bad for you. I wasn't.
- You weren't?

960
01:17:23,716 --> 01:17:24,926
- No.
- Fine.

961
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,140
Stop that, will you? If you do that again...

962
01:17:30,223 --> 01:17:34,019
You can't tell me what to do, okay?
I can't help it.

963
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:39,024
What are you gonna do,
add another felony to your list of crimes?

964
01:17:42,152 --> 01:17:43,361
Go to sleep.

965
01:17:50,702 --> 01:17:54,539
I can't. What's the name of this boyfriend?
Tell me. I'll be nice.

966
01:17:54,623 --> 01:17:57,835
You will? Okay. His name is Paul.

967
01:17:58,418 --> 01:18:03,090
Sounds like a dipshit. Anyone named Paul
is probably a spot welder.

968
01:18:03,841 --> 01:18:05,801
Shut up. Go to sleep.

969
01:18:10,931 --> 01:18:12,683
- Is that true?
- What?

970
01:18:13,392 --> 01:18:14,727
About five years?

971
01:18:15,644 --> 01:18:18,314
- Thought you didn't want to discuss it.
- I don't.

972
01:18:18,397 --> 01:18:20,149
- Then shut up.
- Shut up?

973
01:18:20,232 --> 01:18:21,859
Yeah, I'll shut up.

974
01:18:35,248 --> 01:18:36,332
God.

975
01:19:02,025 --> 01:19:03,777
Let me look at you.

976
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,199
I missed you.

977
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,453
God, I missed you.

978
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:45,236
Doesn't this feel right?

979
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:48,114
I had that dream again.

980
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:51,033
Remember the dream I used to have
after we made love?

981
01:19:51,117 --> 01:19:53,244
The one about the Seven Dwarfs?

982
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:58,249
Remember the dream,
we were in the middle of the ocean...

983
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,752
...and it was that really big sailboat?

984
01:20:00,835 --> 01:20:02,420
- Yeah.
- We were alone.

985
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:05,465
There was nobody around. It was just us.

986
01:20:05,548 --> 01:20:08,927
- That's a nice dream.
- Can't we do that?

987
01:20:09,177 --> 01:20:11,054
Can't we find a way?

988
01:20:11,137 --> 01:20:13,557
I've spent 15 years looking for it.

989
01:20:15,934 --> 01:20:19,187
If I could've found it,
I'd have come and got you, married or not.

990
01:20:19,271 --> 01:20:20,981
- Would you really?
- Yeah.

991
01:20:22,357 --> 01:20:24,568
But there's nothing we can do now.

992
01:20:30,282 --> 01:20:32,117
We gotta get out of here.

993
01:20:32,201 --> 01:20:35,954
I'm gonna see what kind of car
I can get with that watch of yours.

994
01:20:41,919 --> 01:20:43,879
There must be a way.

995
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:49,760
Yeah?

996
01:20:49,844 --> 01:20:52,555
Paul? Marianne. No, I'm fine.

997
01:20:52,638 --> 01:20:53,889
I'm really all right.

998
01:20:55,766 --> 01:20:58,978
I can't talk. I'm fine.
I just need you to help us.

999
01:20:59,061 --> 01:21:01,606
I need you to call someone. Please.

1000
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:03,232
Yes, damn it!

1001
01:21:03,483 --> 01:21:06,569
- I don't have enough time.
- Marianne, your chariot awaits you.

1002
01:21:06,652 --> 01:21:09,113
- Just do it! I gotta go.
- Where are you hiding?

1003
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,866
Better pick it up, hot legs. We gotta go.

1004
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:13,910
- Hi.
- You found me.

1005
01:21:13,993 --> 01:21:16,079
Wait till you see what I got for you.

1006
01:21:16,162 --> 01:21:18,748
- Bring it on out here.
- There's your watch.

1007
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,879
- What a beauty.
- You think so?

1008
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:30,010
Fine piece of equipment.
Look at this little jewel here.

1009
01:21:30,093 --> 01:21:33,513
I had to grind him down,
but he finally accepted my terms.

1010
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:36,725
Hello. Extension 2200, please.

1011
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,604
Hello?

1012
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,733
Yes, Mr. Bernhardt.
Of course I remember you.

1013
01:21:46,151 --> 01:21:47,861
They're headed where?

1014
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,617
She wants federal marshals
and some members of the press there.

1015
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:58,455
You did the right thing by calling me.
I can take care of all that.

1016
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:00,583
No, you wait by the phone.

1017
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:04,336
We'll make sure she's safe.
You don't have to worry.

1018
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,173
You bet. Thank you.

1019
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:29,070
All right. End of the line.

1020
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,533
Jesus, we're overheating.
We're lucky to get here at all.

1021
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,539
Hang on. Wait for me.

1022
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,586
The lights are on, so I guess
there must be somebody in there.

1023
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,883
Lou.

1024
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:01,353
- It's me, Rick.
- In a minute.

1025
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:04,439
Stubborn old guy, isn't he?

1026
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:07,985
You mind if we come in?

1027
01:23:08,944 --> 01:23:10,988
I'll see you at the front door.

1028
01:23:13,949 --> 01:23:16,160
- Lou.
- Yes?

1029
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:19,788
It's me, Rick Jarmin.

1030
01:23:21,832 --> 01:23:23,334
My Lord. So it is.

1031
01:23:23,751 --> 01:23:24,919
Jeez, Lou.

1032
01:23:25,002 --> 01:23:26,754
Come on in. Hi.

1033
01:23:26,837 --> 01:23:29,340
- This is Marianne Graves.
- How do you do?

1034
01:23:31,175 --> 01:23:35,221
You scared the hell out of me.
I thought you forgot who I was.

1035
01:23:36,097 --> 01:23:37,390
I damn near did.

1036
01:23:37,473 --> 01:23:39,934
I'd be in big trouble then,
'cause I'm in a spot...

1037
01:23:40,017 --> 01:23:43,271
...and you're about the only guy
in the world who can help me out.

1038
01:23:43,354 --> 01:23:44,939
Where do I start?

1039
01:23:45,023 --> 01:23:47,609
They finally let Sorenson out of the cage.

1040
01:23:47,692 --> 01:23:52,238
He and Diggs are after us, and they seem
to know every move we're making.

1041
01:23:52,322 --> 01:23:55,033
I think somebody at the Bureau
is doing us in.

1042
01:23:55,158 --> 01:23:56,659
I work at the zoo.

1043
01:23:56,743 --> 01:24:00,372
- I've got connections there.
- You placed me there, remember?

1044
01:24:00,455 --> 01:24:03,041
It's just down the block.

1045
01:24:03,124 --> 01:24:06,253
I can find it every time, even in the dark.

1046
01:24:06,336 --> 01:24:08,296
Molly likes it that way.

1047
01:24:13,719 --> 01:24:15,095
Are you Monty?

1048
01:24:17,514 --> 01:24:19,850
I'm sorry. I didn't hear the bell.

1049
01:24:24,813 --> 01:24:27,316
Are you the young man who was calling?

1050
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:32,863
I told you I didn't think he'd remember.

1051
01:24:32,946 --> 01:24:35,157
That's why I thought
you should come here.

1052
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:38,327
Sometimes it helps if he sees a face.

1053
01:24:47,586 --> 01:24:49,630
Ma'am, do you know who that is?

1054
01:24:56,637 --> 01:25:01,184
Those are federal marshals. I called them.
I thought this was a setup.

1055
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:03,895
Even if it isn't a setup,
you have to talk to them.

1056
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:05,980
You can't keep running...

1057
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:12,987
You're right about one thing.
There's nowhere else to run.

1058
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:15,407
- You have a basement here?
- It's off the kitchen.

1059
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,660
- Can you show it to me?
- What have I done? I'm sorry.

1060
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:26,543
It's designed as a bomb shelter.
No one can get in here.

1061
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:29,421
Go and lock yourselves in.
Don't come out till it's quiet.

1062
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:33,133
- Where are you going, Rick?
- I don't know, Lou.

1063
01:25:33,216 --> 01:25:35,844
How about the zoo? They got guns there.

1064
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:39,014
- You know every inch of the way.
- That's a good idea.

1065
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:45,187
Zoo.

1066
01:25:54,697 --> 01:25:55,656
Hello?

1067
01:25:56,115 --> 01:25:57,324
Hurry up!

1068
01:26:03,789 --> 01:26:07,001
You got nothing to fear. Joe Weyburn.

1069
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:16,469
- Aren't those guys gonna follow us?
- Damn well better.

1070
01:26:44,456 --> 01:26:46,166
They've changed the code.

1071
01:26:59,388 --> 01:27:00,514
Not now!

1072
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,814
- How did you...?
- I can't believe I did that.

1073
01:27:18,115 --> 01:27:19,450
- Come on.
- Wait.

1074
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:28,751
You didn't see us, Bob, okay?

1075
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,100
That's gotta be them.

1076
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,102
Be careful.

1077
01:28:06,832 --> 01:28:08,000
Stationery.

1078
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:11,670
Where is it?
Where do they put these things?

1079
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,843
- They used to have real guns here.
- What's that?

1080
01:28:17,926 --> 01:28:19,720
That's a tranquilizer gun.

1081
01:29:25,162 --> 01:29:26,413
I'm sorry.

1082
01:29:27,122 --> 01:29:30,292
I'm sorry I did this to you.
I called them on you.

1083
01:29:30,667 --> 01:29:32,211
That's all right.

1084
01:29:32,294 --> 01:29:34,379
I should be apologizing to you.

1085
01:29:34,671 --> 01:29:36,924
It's probably for the best.

1086
01:29:37,341 --> 01:29:40,469
- Fifteen years is long enough.
- Yeah, it is.

1087
01:29:46,809 --> 01:29:49,603
Lock the doors and stay in here
no matter what you see.

1088
01:29:49,687 --> 01:29:51,564
Don't come out. Just stay in here.

1089
01:29:51,647 --> 01:29:54,400
If you see me do this,
I want you to hit this button.

1090
01:29:54,483 --> 01:29:56,318
See what it does?

1091
01:29:56,402 --> 01:29:58,613
See those lights there? It turns them on.

1092
01:29:58,696 --> 01:30:00,656
Just like that, okay?

1093
01:30:01,157 --> 01:30:02,867
Keep your head down.

1094
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:08,164
Please live through this.
I can't go to another one of your funerals.

1095
01:30:14,963 --> 01:30:17,131
You remember, you stay in here.

1096
01:30:17,423 --> 01:30:19,342
'Cause it's a zoo out there.

1097
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:49,164
Which one did he say?

1098
01:30:57,381 --> 01:31:00,134
Rick? It's Joe Weyburn.

1099
01:31:00,426 --> 01:31:03,429
We don't mean you any harm.
We just want to talk.

1100
01:32:00,696 --> 01:32:03,031
Welcome to the tropical rain forest.

1101
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:06,159
We have assembled a collection
of flora and fauna...

1102
01:32:06,243 --> 01:32:10,622
...indigenous to both the South American
rain forest and the African Savannah.

1103
01:32:11,457 --> 01:32:12,583
There.

1104
01:32:24,553 --> 01:32:25,471
Shit!

1105
01:33:20,193 --> 01:33:21,570
Think I got him!

1106
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,116
Gotta stop this thing somehow.
Go get that girl!

1107
01:33:26,617 --> 01:33:27,493
Yeah!

1108
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:03,029
Wake up! All of ya! Get up!

1109
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:14,124
Rise and shine! Get up!

1110
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:25,594
Come on, fellas. Give me a hand.

1111
01:35:22,902 --> 01:35:24,487
Shut up! Get back.

1112
01:35:38,835 --> 01:35:40,170
Shut up!

1113
01:36:30,513 --> 01:36:32,056
Shit.

1114
01:37:31,992 --> 01:37:33,327
Excuse me.

1115
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:00,333
Surprise!

1116
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:03,836
Come on. Hands behind your head.
Fingers clenched.

1117
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:04,962
Now!

1118
01:39:06,088 --> 01:39:08,508
What is that shit? Get over there!

1119
01:39:08,591 --> 01:39:09,717
Spread them!

1120
01:39:10,426 --> 01:39:13,012
I got him! I got Jarmin!

1121
01:39:13,096 --> 01:39:15,264
What do you need him for?
Why don't you...

1122
01:39:15,348 --> 01:39:18,393
No, buddy, this is his kill.
Means a lot to him.

1123
01:39:23,064 --> 01:39:24,274
My head.

1124
01:41:45,418 --> 01:41:47,086
I got your lady here.

1125
01:41:48,212 --> 01:41:50,882
Come out, or I'll throw her to the tigers.

1126
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:57,430
You're wrong, Rick,
if you think I won't do it!

1127
01:41:58,348 --> 01:42:00,266
Don't you even want to watch?

1128
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:02,435
I'd hate for you to miss this.

1129
01:43:00,036 --> 01:43:01,579
Fifteen years!

1130
01:43:02,288 --> 01:43:06,417
Fifteen years I've waited for this!

1131
01:44:19,992 --> 01:44:21,411
It's me.

1132
01:44:21,994 --> 01:44:25,206
It's me. Take my hand.

1133
01:44:36,009 --> 01:44:37,093
Please!

1134
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,947
I can't hold on.

1135
01:44:57,030 --> 01:44:59,408
Yes, you can. Come on, honey.
You can do it.

1136
01:44:59,491 --> 01:45:01,827
Just pull me towards you.

1137
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:04,496
I'm sorry I can't get you out of this.

1138
01:45:04,788 --> 01:45:07,249
Me, too. Listen.

1139
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:10,628
I'm free now. I could marry you.

1140
01:45:10,711 --> 01:45:12,838
You liar. You wouldn't marry me.

1141
01:45:13,005 --> 01:45:16,842
I could if you'd just
put a little extra effort in.

1142
01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:18,511
A little extra effort?

1143
01:45:20,054 --> 01:45:24,100
Instead of just watching the father
of your children become tiger meat!

1144
01:45:25,309 --> 01:45:26,852
- Children?
- Children.

1145
01:45:39,657 --> 01:45:41,367
Are you all right, honey?

1146
01:45:45,496 --> 01:45:46,748
Who are you?

1147
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:50,168
Look at me.

1148
01:45:50,251 --> 01:45:53,922
Rick, look at me. I'm Marianne.

1149
01:45:54,005 --> 01:45:57,092
Remember we were gonna get married
and have children?

1150
01:46:00,929 --> 01:46:03,265
I'm pleased to meet you, Marianne.

1151
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:12,941
You dirty rat! Don't even try
to weasel out of this one.

1152
01:46:13,025 --> 01:46:16,486
- I'll sue you for breach of promise!
- I haven't got any money.

1153
01:46:16,570 --> 01:46:19,406
- What'll you get, my underpants?
- I want your underpants.

1154
01:46:28,707 --> 01:46:30,834
I got something I want to show you.

1155
01:46:31,126 --> 01:46:33,629
Get up. Get your lazy ass off.

1156
01:46:37,758 --> 01:46:39,135
You've heard that expression:

1157
01:46:39,218 --> 01:46:42,680
"Something old, something new,
something borrowed and something..."

1158
01:46:45,891 --> 01:46:47,184
Very blue.

1159
01:46:47,935 --> 01:46:49,896
Mr. Wiggly is unfurled.

1160
01:46:49,979 --> 01:46:52,148
And if that's not a hint, what is?

1161
01:46:53,305 --> 01:47:53,353
