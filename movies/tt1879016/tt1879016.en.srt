<i>In any story,
if it's a good story,</i>

3
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,250
<i>there is that which is seen</i>

4
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,458
<i>and that which is hidden.</i>

5
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,791
<i>This is especially true
in stories of war.</i>

6
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,958
<i>There is the war we see,</i>

7
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:09,083
<i>a contest of bombs and bullets,</i>

8
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,541
<i>courage, sacrifice,</i>

9
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,541
<i>and brute force.</i>

10
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,541
<i>As we count the winners,</i>

11
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,041
<i>the losers,</i>

12
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,541
<i>and the dead.</i>

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,583
Now, men! Heave!

14
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:34,041
<i>But alongside this war,</i>

15
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,333
<i>another war is waged.</i>

16
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,625
<i>A battleground in shades of gray,</i>

17
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,708
<i>played out in deception,</i>

18
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,250
<i>seduction,</i>

19
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>and bad faith.</i>

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,333
<i>The participants are strange.</i>

21
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:53,166
<i>They are seldom what they seem,</i>

22
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,750
<i>and fiction and reality blur.</i>

23
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,791
<i>This war is a wilderness of mirrors</i>

24
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:04,375
<i>in which the truth</i>

25
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,458
<i>is protected by a bodyguard of lies.</i>

26
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,375
For the love of Christ.

27
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,333
We should've heard by now.

28
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:17,875
<i>This is our war.</i>

29
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,250
Dear God.

30
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,958
Pray.

31
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:51,625
<i>As I looked up
into the darkened sky and made a vow,</i>

32
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,166
<i>I would give the old country
another day to fit me into something,</i>

33
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:58,083
<i>and if nothing happened,</i>

34
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,166
I would take the next boat for the Cape.

35
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,125
It was then,
as I was fitting my key into the door,

36
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,375
<i>I noticed a man at my elbow.</i>

37
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:11,833
I'd not seen him approach.
And his sudden appearance made me start.

38
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:16,083
"May I come in for a minute?"
the man said,

39
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,791
steadying his voice with effort.

40
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,750
And if it were us, Omega,
would we let him in?

41
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,500
Depends on whether or not
he knew the code, Agent Zed.

42
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,934
<i>No sooner was he through the door...</i>

43
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,625
He <i>did </i>let him in.

44
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,833
...when the odd-little man
poured himself a stiff whiskey,

45
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,208
drank it in three gulps.

46
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,333
"Pardon," he said.

47
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,583
"I'm a bit rattled tonight."

48
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:42,125
"You see, I happen
at this moment to be dead."

49
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,625
I think it's best we keep reading.

50
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,833
Tomorrow's a day of high adventure, Agent.

51
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,291
I think it's best you sleep.

52
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,458
They're here.

53
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,041
Good night.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,625
This gorgeous delicacy
is Afghan cheese

55
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:13,333
made from the milk
of a long-horned and lovesick sheep.

56
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,291
You must be a smuggler, Ivor.

57
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,166
Exotic cheese, the rest of us on rations.

58
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,000
I could manage
your front office, you know,

59
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,625
at the Cheese Eaters League.

60
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,666
Has my brother left you unemployed,
Hester, now that he's retiring?

61
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,916
Oh, is that the rumor?

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I hope that's not
the reason for this party.

63
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Are you not retiring?

64
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:32,791
I've written a lovely speech
saying you are.

65
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,555
Well, then I suggest you write
a lovely speech saying that I am not.

66
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,625
This is simply a hiatus.

67
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,750
Naval supplies.
He's off to whip them into shape.

68
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,166
A noble contribution to this ghastly war.

69
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,375
Maritime hardware.
I have a passion for it.

70
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,458
Ivor, Ewen.

71
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,041
- I'm afraid it's that time.
- That it is, darling.

72
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,125
- I have prepared a dazzling toast.
- Oh.

73
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,166
Though why we're not cheering you
on your last night home...

74
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,041
Oh, don't be silly.
King's Council deserves

75
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,500
a proper sendoff into retirement.

76
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,958
Hester, will you tell my husband
his guests await him.

77
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,250
Absurd, isn't it?
This retirement bit.

78
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:10,708
When both of us know my brother
hasn't tried a case in three years.

79
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,875
When gossip has it, he's been
knee-deep in intelligence for some time.

80
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,958
Ivor.

81
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,375
A grown man, gossiping like a fishwife.

82
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,708
Has he been bumped over to MI5?

83
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,333
- A special mission?
- Oh, my cue.

84
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,749
I see.

85
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,250
Surely he's taking you with him,
whatever it is.

86
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,083
You really do
have an uncanny nose for cheese.

87
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:36,000
To my
distinguished friends and colleagues,

88
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,916
in whose honor we have uncorked
a vintage...

89
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,332
spam.

90
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:45,875
A devious cabal of immediate family
has billed this as my retirement,

91
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:49,916
but you, my cherished guests,
are clever enough to know

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,625
that I will be buried in my silks
before I will ever hang them up for good.

93
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,791
So, let us instead consider this
a cheers to my now full-time post

94
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,291
as superintendent of nautical rivets

95
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,250
and whatever
nuts and bolts may be required

96
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,583
by dear England in her hour of need.

97
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,416
But the real tribute tonight goes to Iris,

98
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,291
my brilliant wife, who in the morning

99
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,041
sails toÂ less troubled shores
with our nestlings in tow.

100
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:19,041
Iris is wiser than Solomon,

101
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,291
stronger than Samson,

102
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,416
and more patient than Job.

103
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,458
But she has to be. She's married to me.

104
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,291
<i>In the Moroccan city of Casablanca,</i>

105
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:44,583
<i>Prime Minister Churchill
has held meetings with President Roosevelt</i>

106
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:46,958
<i>to agree on plans
for the next stage of the war.</i>

107
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,666
<i>As Hitler's Nazis
tighten their grip on occupied Europe,</i>

108
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,666
<i>a mighty host of Allied troop</i> s<i>...</i>

109
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,750
Excuse me.

110
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,000
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

111
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,541
Excuse me. Thank you.

112
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,583
<i>...and prepare for the battle that will
decide the fate of the free world.</i>

113
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,416
<i>In the words of
President Franklin Roosevelt,</i>

114
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:11,458
<i>"The fascists asked for it,
and they're going to get it."</i>

115
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,666
We work together if I'm not mistaken.

116
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,833
You're not mistaken.

117
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,666
Have you seen the main feature,

118
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,291
<i>Confessions of a Nazi Spy</i>?

119
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,833
It's, um... it's based on a real, um,

120
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,916
FBI agent Leon G. Turrou,

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,625
T-U-R-R-O-U, who tracked

122
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,583
Nazi spy rings
in the United States in 1938

123
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:41,625
and went on, amazingly, to arrest
a number of Germans for espionage.

124
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,458
Sorry, I'm late.

125
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,791
I'll let you watch.

126
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,583
It was very gracious,
what you said tonight.

127
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,416
More gracious than it needed to be.

128
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,916
I meant every word.

129
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,916
And I didn't mean for it
to hurt you this way, my leaving.

130
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,708
It seems I'm always the last to go.

131
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,583
Stronger than Samson.

132
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,146
We're off first thing in the morning.

133
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,448
- And I haven't finished packing.
- Well, up you go then.

134
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,166
- Safe journey, my dear.
- I will write to you.

135
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,583
We'll write to each other.

136
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,208
They have to go.

137
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:43,708
Of course they do.

138
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:47,541
If Hitler reaches London, a Jewish family
will be the first on their list.

139
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,458
I would never expose Iris
and theÂ children to that danger.

140
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,458
A separation made all the more painful

141
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:56,958
if it were to become permanent.

142
00:09:58,666 --> 00:09:59,958
She told you?

143
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,833
I pleaded my case many times...

144
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,875
for our family, for the marriage.

145
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,541
Iris says marriages change, that...

146
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,875
romance and love belong to the young.

147
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't believe that

148
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,000
or feel it.

149
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,041
And the thought
they may never be coming back...

150
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,750
I know I can be remote,

151
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,708
lost in my work...

152
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,208
not as attentive as I might be.

153
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,666
You're an imperfect person.
I doubt you're the first.

154
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,166
I want Iris to be happy,

155
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,958
even if it comes at
the expense of my own happiness.

156
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,333
I've never heard her
say a word about unhappiness.

157
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,125
That's because she knows
you'd jump on a grenade for me.

158
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,958
Only on your good days.

159
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,625
Iris said if I really cared,
I'd come to America with them.

160
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:00,583
Oh, people say all sorts of things.

161
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:06,083
She knows your duty is to your family
and your country.

162
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,500
The nightmare marching this way
is only too real.

163
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,666
And Masterman has asked me
to serve on The Twenty Committee.

164
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,125
So you must.

165
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,583
Starting tomorrow.

166
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,750
Goodbye, darlings.

167
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,375
All right, now. That's it. That's it.

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,666
Godspeed, darling.

169
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,083
Our family manor
will be a freezing tomb without you.

170
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:46,000
Take care of your brother,
Ivor, and yourself.

171
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:10,958
It's cold.

172
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,583
I will see to a fresh pot immediately.

173
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,500
They will drag me back
to the bowels any moment.

174
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:20,666
Fresh air, such a luxury now.

175
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,750
Let's walk.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,416
Everyone but a bloody fool
will know it's Sicily.

177
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,333
That may be, Prime Minister,
but it is the only path forward,

178
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,583
given that we must find a way into Europe.

179
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,416
And the most strategic path is Sicily.

180
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:36,916
It leads to Rome.

181
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,333
France will follow.
A successful assault on Sicily

182
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,833
means we will knock Italy out of the war,

183
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:46,208
shatter Nazi morale, and spell
the beginning of their inevitable doom.

184
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,375
Inevitable? Our losses mount daily.

185
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:51,833
As you said yourself, sir,
"Sicily is the soft underbelly."

186
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:53,083
I know what I said.

187
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:58,083
I want to know how it will be achieved,
convincing Herr Hitler we're not gonna do

188
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,916
what anyone with a bloody atlas
can see we'll do.

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,250
Hitler will need to believe
that our next target is Greece,

190
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,875
which, yes,
will require an elaborate deception.

191
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:10,041
A deception plan so complex

192
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,541
I believe it can only be handled
by The Twenty Committee.

193
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,125
Which is why I shall focusÂ the committee's
attention on the "Trout Memo,"

194
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,625
the document I compiled a few years ago,

195
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,625
to which my assistant,

196
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,083
Lieutenant Commander
Ian Fleming, made some contribution.

197
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,083
"Intelligence is like trout fishing."

198
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,208
"The trout fisher, in tying his lure,
attempts to attract the fish."

199
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,291
I detest fish.

200
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:34,416
Well, fish as metaphor, in this case.

201
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:39,541
Uh, the Trout Memo
is a definitive blueprint for spy-craft.

202
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,875
Prime Minister, the memo

203
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,791
in the hands of The Twenty Committee

204
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,291
may, I believe,
hold the key to deceiving Hitler.

205
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:47,833
And while some of the ideas
may appear fantastic...

206
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,333
I applaud the fantastic.

207
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,583
It has many advantages over the mundane.

208
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,291
But the more fantastic,
the more foolproof the plan must be.

209
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,166
Our troops are near dead
from heat in Africa.

210
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,916
I gave Roosevelt my word Sicily was next.

211
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,250
An invasion date of July
is now set in stone.

212
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,833
And right now, thousands of our boys
already lie in Europe's soil.

213
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,958
If we do not fool the Nazis,

214
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,708
and the enemy is
waiting for us on those beaches...

215
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,416
history herself
will avert her eyes from the slaughter.

216
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,333
Mother?

217
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:34,708
Mother, please do not touch
the dolomite while I'm at work.

218
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,000
A lobe in one of the cams is missing.

219
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:40,541
I don't have time to find it now,
but haven't we learned

220
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:42,958
that an overhead camshaft
is virtually useless

221
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,166
without its properly functioning mate?

222
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,000
You might worry about
finding your own mate.

223
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,875
I hope to return with sugar cubes.

224
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,541
And Robbie?

225
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,791
Have you had success
in bringing Robbie home?

226
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,458
- I'm doing all that I can.
- Pulling strings like you promised?

227
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:02,250
- Every string within grasp.
- A real-life war hero.

228
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,625
And where is Chittagong?

229
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:07,708
Bengal.

230
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,083
Good God, what's he doing here?

231
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,583
Montagu? I invited him.

232
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,666
That was a mistake.

233
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:38,541
The main deception we will
feed the Nazis will run as follows.

234
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,166
Our Twelfth Army, which does not exist,

235
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,833
with its 12 divisions,
which also do not exist,

236
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:47,458
will invade Greece six months from now,

237
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,333
on the 10th of July.

238
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,833
We will develop numerous tactics
to reinforce this deception,

239
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,791
bogus troop movements, fake radio traffic.

240
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,083
Our agents
will recruit Greek interpreters,

241
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,250
buy up a sizable cache of drachma,

242
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,000
all to take the focus off Sicily,

243
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:08,333
the real targetÂ and the site
of the actual invasion that same day.

244
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:10,041
And the centerpiece of this deception?

245
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,666
As I just said,Â Commander,
Twelfth Army is the centerpiece.

246
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,416
It's not enough, I'm afraid.

247
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,583
The tactics you've just outlined would

248
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:23,416
point to Greece, but if we had
to get Hitler to divert actual troops

249
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,583
from Sicily,
given her strategic importance,

250
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:29,458
we would need to provide him with proof
of our intention towards Greece.

251
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,458
- Fake proof, of course.
- I agree with that.

252
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,375
And to that end, um,

253
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,875
I've also been working on
a deception plan,

254
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,666
which I've dubbed Operation Trojan Horse.

255
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a... it's a ruse taken
from the Trout Memo.

256
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,416
Idea number 28.

257
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,375
Number 28? A corpse carrying false papers

258
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,778
drops on the coast
from a parachute that supposedly failed.

259
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:48,000
The Trout Memo is dead.

260
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,833
I believe the prime minister
has an aversion to fish,Â Admiral.

261
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,750
He did not kill the entire memo.

262
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,541
A corpse carrying fake documents, hmm?

263
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,333
Of all the ideas in the Trout Memo,
that one is by far the most precarious.

264
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:03,000
Except the Germans will be
skittish on account of Spain,

265
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,208
where they recently
failed to follow up real papers

266
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,125
on the body of an airman
washed up in Cadiz.

267
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,875
So may I suggest the timing is perfect.

268
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,750
- For Trojan Horse?
- Mm.

269
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:13,791
A code name a child could decipher.

270
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:18,416
And the Germans would be expecting us to
plant papers precisely <i>because</i> of Cadiz.

271
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,416
Or the Nazis being linear thinkers

272
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,541
would not want to
make the same mistake twice.

273
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
Simply a version of the Haversack Ruse.

274
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,188
Of which, of course, I am well aware.

275
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,130
Then you will also be aware
that the ruse has a good track record,

276
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,250
which is what I believe my friend...

277
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:34,333
Uh, Flight Lieutenant Cholmondeley.
C-H-O-L-M-O-N-D-E-L-E-Y.

278
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,500
...was trying to say.

279
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,958
For those of you who don't know
Lt. Commander Montagu,

280
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,458
he joins us from the Old Bailey,

281
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,458
which means he's had
little time for deception.

282
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:42,958
I've spent my days in court, sir.

283
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,458
Hence, he is blind to the obvious pitfalls

284
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,458
of tossing a letter-laden corpse
into the sea.

285
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:52,916
I'm simply saying that for a deception
to reach Hitler, it must have a channel.

286
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,375
Spain is neutral,
the ideal place to launch such a plan

287
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,750
because she is crawling with
spies from both sides.

288
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,184
- She has a vast coastline.
- And since our agents

289
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,968
in Madrid have
an elaborate network, we could

290
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,375
quite literally float the documents
right into enemy hands.

291
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,250
Montagu and Cholmondeley
are clearly convinced

292
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,853
they have a direct line to the Fuhrer.

293
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:14,208
So let's wish them both luck
implementing Operation Trojan Horse.

294
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:17,458
The rest of us will proceed
with the operation I have outlined.

295
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,708
I have a vested interest in this plot,

296
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:22,791
which is why I've told M
in no uncertain terms

297
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,208
you'll need a secure space,
command center, a staff...

298
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,916
But do we think it can work?

299
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,750
- I know I just made a case for it.
- An eloquent case.

300
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,666
It's the Haversack Ruse.
It's tried, tested.

301
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,750
"Deception needs a channel."
Those were your words.

302
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,791
They were. I'm only imagining

303
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,916
a dead body

304
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,208
hurtling through the air.

305
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,166
The plan is bold, there's no question,

306
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,166
but it's ours now, regardless.
M's seen to that.

307
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,125
Although, what if the body
does disintegrate on impact?

308
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,500
Let's not bring that up now,
shall we?

309
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,333
And definitely not in front of M.

310
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,625
Why do you call Godfrey "M"?

311
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,833
Because I called my mother "M."

312
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:05,250
Most terrifying, most impossible,
most demanding creature I've ever known.

313
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,351
What if the plane with the body
is intercepted before he's dropped?

314
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,935
So, Mother has no faith in this?

315
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,541
That's because Number 28
wasn't Godfrey's idea.

316
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,041
It was mine, a plot I cribbed
from Basil Thompson's novel

317
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,166
<i>The Milliner's Hat</i>.

318
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,892
- Have you read Thompson?
- I prefer Buchan.

319
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,756
Or what if the autopsy reveals
that he didn't die of drowning?

320
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,833
Or if the briefcase is returned to us
without the Germans seeing its contents?

321
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,666
Charles, why on earth
do you keep poking holes in our plan?

322
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,041
I'm preemptively poking

323
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,375
to ensure all the details
are properly thought through.

324
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,083
Because as Godfrey made clear,

325
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,966
our feet will be
held to the fire soon enough.

326
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,250
The plan will work if we make it work.

327
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,333
He's put you down here.

328
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,458
I will certainly
be removed from prying eyes.

329
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:50,250
Removed from
life in all forms, even the air.

330
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,180
Will you be joining us down here, Fleming?

331
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:55,708
I will likely stay upstairs.

332
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,791
But whomever is equally industrious
will succeed equally well.

333
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
<i>- The Milliner's Hat</i>, no doubt.
- Ah.

334
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,291
Oh well, The Twenty Committee certainly

335
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,083
has its advantages,
I suppose, if you like spooks.

336
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:13,666
My friends think I'm
working in naval supplies.

337
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,583
My mother believes I'm a clerk.

338
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,208
And Robert Cholmondeley?

339
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,791
My brother.

340
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,958
I did hear the news from Chittagong.

341
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,791
My deepest condolences.

342
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,708
No, yes, we've lost a real hero.

343
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,875
Leaving my mother with me, the penguin,

344
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,375
RAF pilot and officer
with big feet and bad eyes,

345
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,000
which means I'm,Â in effect, grounded,

346
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,208
flightless bird.

347
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,708
Well, what say we start with

348
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,416
the easy part and find ourselves a corpse?

349
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,333
You can take your pick, to be honest.

350
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,625
That goes right down the corridor.

351
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,541
Right, you can go straight through there.

352
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,583
Two, three, lift.

353
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,041
You did say drownings.

354
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:08,916
Room 13.

355
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,750
Coroner Birtwistle for you.

356
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,458
Montagu.

357
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,541
This is the same
Official Secrets Act

358
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,041
you signed for Bletchley,

359
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,625
but this covers your work
with The Twenty Committee

360
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,375
and here in room 13.

361
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,625
Male, of service age, drowned.

362
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,958
- Now, tell me why you want him?
- Where are his legs?

363
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,375
And are there 20 in The Twenty Committee?

364
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,375
No, twenty's a joke. Two Xs.

365
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,166
Ah, the Roman numerals.

366
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,083
Oh, as in double-cross?

367
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:41,875
You will use your Bletchley skills
to fish for cues in decoded chatter

368
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,125
about Sicily, Greece,
enemy troops in those areas.

369
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,416
Is that understood?

370
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,375
The team in 102 are planning
fake training exercises.

371
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,833
106 are running double agents.

372
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:57,625
107 will be dropping leaflets on Cypress.

373
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,428
I don't know yet
what the leaflets will say.

374
00:21:59,458 --> 00:22:03,125
And yet here we are in a huge city
in the middle of a world war,

375
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:06,958
and we can't seem to find ourselves
a single suitable corpse.

376
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,958
We need an insider.

377
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,541
We need Bentley Purchase.

378
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,375
And to what purpose would the body be put?

379
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,375
A warlike operation,
that's really all we can say.

380
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,041
Although we can also say
that the body must be male,

381
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,166
of service age, intact,

382
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,875
and could pass for a drowning.

383
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:27,333
Intriguing, but I'll have to demur.

384
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,666
Public confidence in our office

385
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,291
would be irreparably shaken
if something like that got out.

386
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,708
Like the Darby case?

387
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,583
You remember the Darby case, Bentley?

388
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,123
I brought you in
to give the evidence a second look.

389
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,750
Your testimony won the case.

390
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,166
Case cemented your reputation,

391
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,375
which led to your position here,
if I'm not mistaken.

392
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:46,250
In a nutshell.

393
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,583
The matter here is urgent.

394
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,500
It is top secret,
and it is approved at the highest level.

395
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,458
- It cannot be high enough.
- Churchill has approved it.

396
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,541
Fresh as a daisy.

397
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,791
Transferred from
Saint Pancras hospital yesterday.

398
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,155
What is your name, dear?

399
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:18,916
This is...

400
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,458
was...

401
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,375
Glyndwr Michael.

402
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,958
<i>What is it
you do for work, Glyndwr?</i>

403
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,833
<i>There is no occupation
noted in the man's chart.</i>

404
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,541
Appears he was originally
from Aberbargoed,

405
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:34,541
but in London, he was a vagrant,
no fixed address.

406
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:38,583
<i>Cause of death is chemical toxicity</i>

407
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,000
<i>from rat poison left on bread.</i>

408
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,625
I want you to know,
God forgives you, Glyndwr,

409
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,916
for hating yourself so much
you'd take your own life.

410
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:52,416
<i>It appears the man
ended his life while of unsound mind.</i>

411
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,125
Luckily for us, the human body
contains a host of chemicals naturally,

412
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,000
so determining how he died
should he be immersed in water

413
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,208
would require a highly skilled coroner.

414
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,666
Where would you be landing him?

415
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:06,208
Most likely a small coastal town.

416
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:08,625
Where the local coroner,
if there's one at all,

417
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,541
won't have the foggiest idea
why this chap kicked the bucket.

418
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,833
Do you have any relatives, Glyndwr?

419
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,000
Do you have a next of kin?

420
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:23,125
The body is unclaimed,

421
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:27,958
but I must warn you,
our friend will soon start to rot.

422
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:30,000
I can place him in our coldest box,

423
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,375
which will retard decomposition
but not arrest it.

424
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,458
Meaning if Glyndwr Michael

425
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,833
is to be of any use to you at all,

426
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,583
he must be in service within three months.

427
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,458
<i>In the real war,</i>

428
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,625
<i>there are constant reminders
of the brutality at hand.</i>

429
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,583
<i>A quarter of a million lie dead in battle,</i>

430
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,875
<i>an unspeakable horror</i>

431
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,500
<i>with no end in sight.</i>

432
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,500
I'll be at my club.

433
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,083
And I shall be up to no good

434
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,958
as usual.

435
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,875
<i>While in the other war,</i>

436
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,500
<i>the war of shadows</i>

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,541
<i>normal life appears to continue,</i>

438
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:20,666
<i>itself an act of canny deception.</i>

439
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,333
<i>In this war,</i>

440
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,916
<i>real lives are also lost,</i>

441
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:38,500
<i>and even fictional lives
can meet an untimely end.</i>

442
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,000
I believe my guests
have preceded me, Teddy.

443
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:46,375
They have, sir,

444
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,083
and ordered their drinks.

445
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,166
Thank you.

446
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,708
<i>And once in a great while,</i>

447
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:56,125
<i>the laws of nature
reverse themselves entirely,</i>

448
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:59,500
<i>and the dead are made alive again.</i>

449
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,500
We were just discussing our chap.

450
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:03,833
The crucial thing is that he must be real.

451
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,958
As real as you or I.

452
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,166
He must have parents, for example.

453
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,833
Rank, regiment,
bank accounts, love affairs...

454
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,041
Nicotine habit. He attended Oundle.

455
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,208
Flew kites as a boy.

456
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,041
And on a blustery day, you'll still
find him kiting in Dulwich Park.

457
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,916
Thing is, the Germans will
scrutinize every detail of our fallen man.

458
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,750
- So the slightest inconsistency...
- Ah, Teddy. Thank you.

459
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,708
- Martini.
- Thank you.

460
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,000
- Gin and lemon for the lady.
- Thank you.

461
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:34,916
Even the, uh, slightest inconsistency
will signal the ruse.

462
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,291
So, to create a real fake man
from a real dead man,

463
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,707
we start by...

464
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,000
By giving him a real, real name.

465
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,208
- John would be solid.
- James. George. Robert is good.

466
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,333
- That's my brother's name.
- Of course, forgive me.

467
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,291
- But William could work.
- It could.

468
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,625
And William would be a Royal Marine.

469
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:56,250
An officer in the Royal Marines
if he's carrying secret letters.

470
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:57,249
Exactly right.

471
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,458
An officer in the Royal Marines

472
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:01,038
with a common British name,

473
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,916
so that when
the Germans check the Navy lists,

474
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,416
it will be harder to
track down a Major William Martin.

475
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,625
With your identification number.
How very clever.

476
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,625
So, if the Germans do follow the name...

477
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,708
Ewen will be the first to know.

478
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:19,333
There it is, as if I... were him.

479
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,583
- Now, all we need is his photograph.
- In Royal Marine Blues.

480
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,958
No, no. Marines travel in battledress,
and our Marine will be traveling.

481
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,041
And the uniform cannot appear new.

482
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,875
<i>It must be broken down.</i>

483
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:32,583
<i>It must have exactly
the right patina of wear,</i>

484
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,125
as if I were him.

485
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,458
There must be a love story
if Maj. Martin's life is to be believable.

486
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,041
Objection.
Creation of a material fact.

487
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,416
A real life need not be a romantic one.

488
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,476
He would carry a letter from his betrothed
professing her deep love for him.

489
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,166
That's very good. That's precisely
the level of detail we need.

490
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:51,267
- And he would carry her photograph.
- Yes.

491
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:53,541
Well, we clearly read different novels.

492
00:27:53,625 --> 00:27:56,500
Well, why not ask
some of our female colleagues

493
00:27:56,583 --> 00:27:58,500
if they might be willing
to submit snapshots,

494
00:27:58,583 --> 00:28:00,875
and perhaps we can
find a partner for our Major Martin.

495
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:02,333
That's not a risk?

496
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,458
Picking a girl working <i>in </i>the Admiralty?

497
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:07,041
She's an anonymous girl,
washed up on a distant shore.

498
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,458
Oh, she might even be thrilled

499
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,833
to find herself
in the middle of a dangerous plot.

500
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,166
Lives at stake, countries at war.

501
00:28:13,916 --> 00:28:16,125
Her lover torn away by duty and fate.

502
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:21,500
You want me to help you?

503
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,458
And by extension,
help your country.

504
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,416
Yes, you know all the girls
in the office and, um,

505
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:31,041
I've seen the way you go about your work.
You're very clever and,

506
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,291
uh, meticulous and...

507
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,583
You've been watching me.

508
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:38,125
No, no, not... there's certainly...
there's nothing untoward, I simply...

509
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:44,208
If you could point me to a girl
who would give us her photograph.

510
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,208
But what would her photograph be used for?

511
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,250
Well, I'm afraid that's classified.

512
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,458
But, um, by donating her image,
she'd be involved in

513
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,583
and on the ground floor
of a significant operation.

514
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,458
Operation Trojan Horse.

515
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,625
It's been renamed,

516
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,500
something less obvious.

517
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,375
Operation Mincemeat.

518
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,166
Due to the dead body.

519
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,291
- You surmised that rather quickly.
- I already knew the plot.

520
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,083
Would something like this do?

521
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,958
Taken by my husband a long time ago.

522
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:23,708
Your husband,

523
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,708
I didn't realize, um...

524
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,041
Well, it... it's

525
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:30,291
lovely. It's... it's perfect.

526
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,500
It could be my
contribution to the mission.

527
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,500
First of many, perhaps.

528
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,791
My photograph in exchange
for a seat at the table.

529
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:43,333
Very well.

530
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,666
I'm all ears.

531
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:52,375
Well, we've managed to find a body.

532
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,375
Pretty as a picture.

533
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,210
<i>And the process
of transforming him into</i>

534
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,000
<i>Major William Martin is on the way.</i>

535
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:05,958
Bloody hell!

536
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:09,958
Let's just not attempt
to make him smile again, please.

537
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,851
- Does none of us any favors.
- Because he looks dead, Bentley.

538
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,875
<i>Whatever we do, just deader and deader.</i>

539
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,875
It's hard to come alive
for one's close up in this state.

540
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,625
If we bungle one tiny detail,

541
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:22,458
<i>a droopy eyelid,
an open mouth instead of a smile,</i>

542
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:25,500
<i>we might as well telegraph
Berlin ourselves it's all a hoax.</i>

543
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,750
Then may I suggest a live face?

544
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,583
That looks just like the dead face?

545
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,041
In a city of nine million,

546
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,583
surely someone resembles our friend.

547
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,583
Do we think he'd be dancing?

548
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:51,083
Major Martin, if he were here?

549
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:52,164
Well, he is an officer.

550
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,416
Well, not all officers dance, and I doubt
our Bill gives two figs for dancing.

551
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,583
No, too full in the face.

552
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,041
- But without theÂ mustache?
- His brow is too heavy.

553
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:04,026
Why don't we try something easier,

554
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:06,125
for God's sake,
like looking for tits on a bull?

555
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,291
Forgive me. That was uncalled for.

556
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,375
No, I saw the photographs.
It's called for.

557
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,750
As for dancing, I suspect
the major's not much for a foxtrot

558
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,125
but could clear the floor with a tango.

559
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,625
Our progress to date:
Major Bill Martin is an industrious chap,

560
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:24,250
occasionally forgetful,
habitually tardy, but also clever.

561
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:26,351
- Amend that to brilliant.
- He's no good with money.

562
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,517
We should include
an overdraft letter in his briefcase.

563
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,583
And is he happy? Is he a happy man?

564
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,708
He wants to be.

565
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,208
He started out with such promise,

566
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:37,916
a sense of hope about,
about the world, about his future.

567
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,250
But now it all seems dark, uncertain.

568
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,458
He is in the middle of a war.

569
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:46,625
Exactly right.
He signed up for the Royal Marines.

570
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,833
But once commissioned was consigned
to a desk, which he despised.

571
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:53,333
Because the life he really wanted
was one of daring and intrigue,

572
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:57,125
and so he escaped,
and he switched to the commandos,

573
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,248
where he distinguished
himself in technical matters.

574
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,875
The mechanics of landing craft.

575
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,158
And he predicted
the Dieppe Raid would be a catastrophe.

576
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,328
And how right he was.

577
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,750
He sounds like a character
from Sir John's latest novel.

578
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:10,041
- Masterman is writing a novel?
- A spy novel.

579
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:12,333
Apparently, he thinks of me as his muse.

580
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:15,500
Well then, he may be in for a duel
because you're Major Martin's muse now.

581
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,000
The girl I was at 20 is his muse.

582
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,726
Nevertheless, it's your photograph
that will be pressed to his heart

583
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,708
when he washes ashore.

584
00:32:21,709 --> 00:32:23,791
Yes, wallet litter
is what you are.

585
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,291
Not as in rubbish.

586
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,291
That's just spy parlance
for the bits and pieces

587
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,000
that one finds in one's pockets.

588
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,458
And do I have a name?

589
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,541
Pam.

590
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,458
Not five weeks ago,
the major looked across a crowded room.

591
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:39,250
Across a crowded room.

592
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,541
The major sat

593
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,500
at a small table in a strange bar

594
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,041
and found himself with a woman

595
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,208
both known and
unknown to him all at once.

596
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,750
Within days, something deep

597
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,166
and unexpected had blossomed,
culminating in a diamond ring

598
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,291
slid onto Pam's slim finger

599
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,458
as Bill revealed himself to her
as a changed man.

600
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:05,125
Jean?

601
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,750
Jean.

602
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:09,833
There you are.

603
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,458
I had him down as a guest.

604
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:15,083
Yes, under Lieutenant Commander
Montagu's name. Thank you.

605
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:19,083
- Please, sit.
- Thanks.

606
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,208
I suppose it's very fashionable
these days marrying an American.

607
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:25,250
Who, me? Oh no, that'd be my lucky day.

608
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,583
Jean and I only just met, but, uh,

609
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:31,375
well, so far she tolerates me well enough,
so I guess there's hope.

610
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,041
I'm a widow.

611
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:37,541
So, this is my friend
Sergeant Roger Dearborn.

612
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,000
It's nice to meet you all.

613
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:42,416
Jean said you wanted to talk to me?

614
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,208
Or you didn't want to talk to me.

615
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:51,541
Uh, no, we did, because we were
discussing something, top-secret project.

616
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:52,666
A study.

617
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,625
Profiling...

618
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,750
American servicemen
and how they might...

619
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,666
...integrate
with British troops.

620
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,583
That's top-secret?

621
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:03,792
The Nazis wreaked havoc
with the radio antenna.

622
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,515
Well, I'm not sure what that has to do...

623
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:09,041
What, what we're wondering is whether you
would care to participate in the project?

624
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:11,045
It wouldn't take much time.
Just a few questions.

625
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,583
Allow us to take your photograph.

626
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,125
We could arrange for you
to come around to the Admiralty,

627
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,250
say tomorrow.

628
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,666
Go on. It'll be fun.

629
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,791
- Okay, then.
- Very nice to meet you.

630
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,309
- Thanks.
- So, I'll see you tomorrow.

631
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,333
Hopefully, see you soon.

632
00:34:26,916 --> 00:34:28,916
What do you think? Well, he could do?

633
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,208
- I know he's not a perfect match, but...
- A gift horse. He will do.

634
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:33,791
A toast.

635
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,083
To Pam, our secret weapon

636
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,625
who's already managed
to see what we could not.

637
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:44,208
No, I think it was after university
that Bill took up the bass...

638
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,583
I think it was trumpet.

639
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,416
...which was frowned upon
by his mother, Antonia,

640
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,541
a devout Catholic who at all times
kept a candle lit for Saint Jude.

641
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:55,375
Every piece makes a whole.
A man is a mosaic.

642
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,875
Will you wake your family
getting home so late?

643
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,166
My wife is in America with the children.

644
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,333
Hester told me just this morning

645
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:08,625
she'd taken a job there,
with the British Security Coordination.

646
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,250
Hester told you?

647
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:15,083
May I just say I was
very sorry to hear of your husband.

648
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,916
I've been alone for many years,

649
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,958
which is why it pleases me
to see Bill and Pam so madly in love.

650
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,750
Pam is very lucky
to have you cheering her on.

651
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,583
And Bill, you.

652
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,041
Thank you for walking with me.

653
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:32,916
I can see you all the way up.

654
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,208
Actually, I think I'll stay.

655
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,541
What, in there?

656
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,625
Alone?

657
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,458
No, I couldn't possibly.

658
00:35:40,958 --> 00:35:43,708
I'm perfectly capable
of taking care of myself.

659
00:35:43,791 --> 00:35:45,250
Who would argue otherwise?

660
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,083
It's Bill and Pam's favorite song.

661
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,541
Whoo!

662
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:43,083
It was more like a lethal Lindy Hop.

663
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:46,166
You flattened every male
of fighting age in the place.

664
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:48,208
I was testing it out.

665
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,708
Oh, a secret weapon against the Nazis.

666
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,875
Pam's secret weapon.

667
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:55,416
Her way of forgetting her woes.

668
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,791
Major Martin will need
the stamina of an ox.

669
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,208
She's a surprising woman though,
isn't she? Pam?

670
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:06,458
At a crossroads in her life, still young.

671
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:10,166
Probably, hasn't quite found her stride.

672
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,500
Is she younger than Bill?

673
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,625
I hadn't pictured them that way.

674
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,291
Well, Bill's hardly old.

675
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:19,041
If you say so.

676
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:24,666
What I think Pam sees in Bill
beyond the dashing figure he cuts

677
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,416
when he walks into a room,

678
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,250
is something deeper.

679
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,791
And Bill suspects the same in her.

680
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,791
But at first, all he sees
is a woman of fierce intelligence,

681
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:37,541
uncommon grace,
a demon on the dance floor.

682
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,250
A woman ready to take wing.

683
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,791
I think she's already on her way.

684
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,041
A happy story.

685
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:48,333
Except that he's off to war.

686
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,458
Which is tomorrow's work.

687
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:52,500
And I'll need your help.

688
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,666
I'll wait here till you're in.

689
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,666
I'll be fine. Thank you.

690
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:03,583
Goodnight.

691
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:14,458
Writing sample number five,

692
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,166
standard blue-black,
in leather wallet, in pocket

693
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,916
soaked overnight in seawater.

694
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,166
Seawater from?

695
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:22,875
It does matter, Hester.

696
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:25,625
Disposal shut down the road
in all directions.

697
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:28,708
A child found
an unexploded firebomb in her garden.

698
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:30,125
Oh, dear God.

699
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,000
No word from Bletchley?

700
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:35,750
Nazi command still expects us
to launch a naval assault on Europe.

701
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,541
They suspect a massive deception
operation is underway.

702
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:41,875
They still believe Sicily
will be the target.

703
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,083
So, two months of work
and we've managed to deceive the enemy

704
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,958
of precisely nothing.

705
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:50,916
The one bright spot is I found
a hydrographer. I'm meeting him now.

706
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,083
Well, I hope it's not
Hespers from Naval Operations.

707
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,333
The man is an incorrigible skirt chaser.

708
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,791
My skirt can defend itself,

709
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:59,250
but I could use your expertise, Commander.

710
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,791
Very well.

711
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,164
Room 13.

712
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,416
That is his rank,

713
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,125
Lieutenant Commander.

714
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:14,291
Of course. They were just less... formal
when I saw them a few weeks ago

715
00:39:14,958 --> 00:39:16,208
dancing at Rainbow Corner.

716
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:19,666
- I saw them a few rows back...
- Lieutenant, Admiral Godfrey.

717
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,476
Joseph Cotton plays
an American engineer hiding in Anatolia.

718
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,041
- Admiral.
- So, where are we with Mincemeat?

719
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,000
We're on a solid footing,
sir.

720
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,458
Yes, Major Martin
is as real as you or I.

721
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,166
He has hobbies,

722
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,726
debts, a girl. They're... They're to marry.
We have a ring, ha.

723
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,666
Touching.

724
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,041
We believe Major Martin
should be delivered by submarine

725
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:41,250
rather than air-dropping
and risk dismemberment.

726
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:44,375
And we are convinced that Spain is
still the best place to float him ashore,

727
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:47,541
given the fascists' network there
and Spain's neutrality.

728
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:51,041
And we believe
the plan is ready to present, sir,

729
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:52,458
to the prime minister.

730
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:53,958
I agree.

731
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:56,875
You...

732
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,958
Well, that's, uh, that's excellent news.

733
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,083
I'll present it to
Churchill this afternoon.

734
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,184
- I'll need a brief.
- Well, we've prepared one for you, sir.

735
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,333
You'll be more than ready.

736
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,125
And your partnership with Montagu. Please.

737
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,958
How has that fared?

738
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,958
Nothing short of first-rate, sir.

739
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,416
Montagu and I think with one mind. We, um,

740
00:40:21,916 --> 00:40:23,416
we've developed a shorthand.

741
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,250
Become good friends.

742
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,458
Huh, So you've
met his brother, then? Ivor.

743
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,625
No, no. Montagu rarely speaks of him.

744
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:33,708
Are you aware
he's a Communist sympathizer?

745
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,166
Montagu's brother? That's absurd.

746
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,458
Our intelligence
suggests otherwise.

747
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,583
Why would our intelligence
be watching Ivor Montagu?

748
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:53,500
Whatever Ivor may or may not be,

749
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:56,316
his brother would be unaware of it.

750
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,041
It's always sound policy
to keep one's ear to the ground,

751
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,125
don't you think?

752
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,250
Thank you.

753
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:12,041
I shall look forward to good news
from the prime minister, sir.

754
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:18,625
I only mention it because Charles
asked me out to dinner tonight.

755
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,416
Did you invite him to join us?

756
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,208
I didn't say I was going with you.

757
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,333
I sense he'd be upset somehow.

758
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,833
That's silly.
The man's not a child.

759
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,666
Oh, I almost forgot.

760
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,625
What do you think?

761
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,250
It's beautiful.

762
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,708
Charles and I
ducked out at lunch yesterday.

763
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,541
He preferred the round cut,
but I prevailed with the marquise.

764
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,333
Let's see it on.

765
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,500
The only place
this belongs is in the safe.

766
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Admiralty property.

767
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,416
Yes, of course.

768
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:54,583
You think Pam will like it?

769
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,083
I think she might.

770
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,480
This should be in the safe.

771
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,916
Yes, I was about to put it back.

772
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,666
I wanted to show it to Jean.

773
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,041
You gave it to Jean?

774
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,875
I showed it to her.

775
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,125
I wanted to see what she thought of it.

776
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,633
If you're so concerned,
stow it away yourself.

777
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:28,083
In matters of protocol,
it seems bad practice,

778
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,791
sloppy even,
for us to be going off as separate pairs.

779
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,208
Like you and Godfrey.

780
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,708
He called you in alone just now,
didn't he?

781
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,958
Why was that?

782
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,833
Godfrey is only happy when he's

783
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:40,958
stirring up suspicion and discord,
as you well know.

784
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,958
Room 13.

785
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,333
Bentley Purchase for you.

786
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:47,166
Yes, Bentley, what is it?

787
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,833
<i>We've had an unexpected visitor.</i>

788
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,333
Ms. Michael heard of
her brother's passing from

789
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,083
Stafford Hospital.

790
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:00,125
A kindly nurse who cared for him then
took it upon herself to find his kin.

791
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,166
God bless her.

792
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:09,375
- Please accept our deepest...
- We only had each other... you know?

793
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:13,541
He needed looking after, Glynnie.

794
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:17,000
But I let him go to London.

795
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,833
And then I...

796
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:24,875
<i>Stamps,</i>

797
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,291
<i>tickets,</i>

798
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:30,166
an unwrapped mint?

799
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,125
- It's called wallet litter, sir.
- Yes, I know what it is.

800
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,500
But it's the letters in the case

801
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,343
that are key to this deception,
are they not?

802
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,375
They are.

803
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,375
Military correspondence

804
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,375
indicating that we will invade Greece

805
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,833
while hinting
that our cover plan is Sicily.

806
00:43:44,916 --> 00:43:45,916
Yes.

807
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,458
The brief contains
details of the correspondence.

808
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:51,708
What happens when the ink
washes off as the letter bobs in the sea?

809
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:54,666
They need to use waterproof ink.

810
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,583
Only someone planning to drown
writes in waterproof ink.

811
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,666
Yes,

812
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:00,791
that's true.Â But, uh...

813
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,541
A detail your men clearly understand
as they state here that,

814
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,875
"Further testing of undetectable
waterproof inks remains to be done."

815
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:12,541
- Yes, good boy.
- Come on.

816
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:16,250
Given how little you
appreciate of this plan, Admiral,

817
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,916
Rufus and I wonder
why you're endorsing it at all.

818
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,458
I am not endorsing it, Prime Minister.

819
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,416
My advice is that Mincemeat is killed
before it sees the light of day.

820
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,666
Our other deception plans are strategies

821
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,500
designed to confuse the enemy,
throw him off balance.

822
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,625
Mincemeat, on the other hand,
is an outright lie.

823
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:37,375
A lie that,Â if detected, would expose
every single other deception as false.

824
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:40,208
The Germans would know
unequivocally we were landing in Sicily.

825
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,541
I think that's too big a risk.

826
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:45,583
Nonetheless, I would like to
keep Mincemeat running a little longer.

827
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:50,375
It may yield intelligence on Ivor Montagu,
whom we suspect is a Russian spy.

828
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:54,750
You will put the fate of one Russian spy
over tens of thousands in Sicily?

829
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,875
With respect, Prime Minister,
I'm trying to look at the bigger picture.

830
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:00,375
Russia may be our ally at the moment,

831
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,500
but she was until recently
in a pact with Germany.

832
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,583
I believe she will soon
be our enemy again.

833
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:08,083
If Ivor Montagu is spying for Moscow,

834
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:12,125
he can be turned,
or if necessary,Â eliminated.

835
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,791
This is the problem
when one is dealing with spooks.

836
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:16,375
You do see it.

837
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,583
The corkscrew thinking required

838
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:21,875
to manage spies
sometimes twists one too many turns

839
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:25,041
until one finds oneself charging forward

840
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,583
while at the same time
looking out of one's own ass.

841
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:30,375
I assume you're referring to me.

842
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,125
Russia is tomorrow's war.

843
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,666
The Nazis are expecting a deception,

844
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:39,375
which means that our effort
must be unbelievableÂ enough

845
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,541
to make it believable.

846
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:43,500
The plan is risky.
It's also highly implausible.

847
00:45:44,416 --> 00:45:46,216
Meaning that all the reasons
it shouldn't work

848
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:48,833
are the same reasons
the Germans might believe it's true.

849
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,250
So, when can it be ready?

850
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:51,333
Uh...

851
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,500
- Immediately?
- Correct.

852
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,375
Gather your resources.

853
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,083
Put Mincemeat in the works as of now.

854
00:45:58,583 --> 00:45:59,750
Of course, sir.

855
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:08,750
Do you think we can get him buried soon?

856
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:12,500
But... Not that anyone's
waiting for me at home,

857
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,750
but a simple service might be nice.

858
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:17,291
The truth is Glyndwr is employed now.

859
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,875
- Employed?
- In the service of his country.

860
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:24,914
He's not dead?

861
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,708
He is engaged in a

862
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,875
top-secret mission.

863
00:46:28,958 --> 00:46:30,708
As what?

864
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,416
You do know thatÂ Glynnie
was never right in the head.

865
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,958
Well, that

866
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,500
may be your experience of

867
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Glyndwr, but, um,

868
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,916
people are often

869
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,041
one way with family, a...

870
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,916
different way entirely out
in the world.

871
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,041
One minute Jekyll, the next, Hyde.

872
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,499
Where is he?

873
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,208
We have Churchill's approval.

874
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,083
As you just heard, Ms. Michael,

875
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:00,500
the prime minister has approved
the plan to make your brother a hero.

876
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:04,375
We, we do understand
that this is the most enormous sacrifice.

877
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:07,916
But his service, he... he can save

878
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:10,750
literally thousands,
tens of thousands of lives.

879
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,208
What did you do to him?

880
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:15,625
Did you carve him up for experiments

881
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,125
or rations?

882
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,833
Maybe you should tell the police
about what you did to my brother.

883
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:24,041
Ms. Michael,
in acknowledgment of his service

884
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:28,791
and empowered by his Majesty's
government and by Glyndwr himself,

885
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,333
it is my honor to offer you this

886
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:33,541
generous remuneration.

887
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:37,041
- You're bribing me.
- Your brother is going to war.

888
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,291
He's trying to do
the right thing for his country.

889
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:44,125
His country is trying to do
the right thing by you.

890
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,458
Please.

891
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:53,166
May Glynnie's poor
suffering soul rest in peace.

892
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
No thanks to you.

893
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,541
May God forgive us all.

894
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,611
I miss Spain already.

895
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,125
There's a reason we stay
as far from headquarters as possible.

896
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:11,291
Yes, we envy youÂ daily.

897
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,125
I must congratulate you,Â if I may,

898
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,416
Captain Ainsworth, on <i>The Night Starling.</i>

899
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,291
I grabbed a copy at Hatchards yesterday.

900
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,815
I have not been able to put it down.

901
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:21,291
My God, who isn't writing a novel?

902
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:26,458
Admiral, our navalÂ attachÃ© in Madrid,
Captain Ainsworth, is here today.

903
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:30,333
And this is assistant navalÂ attachÃ©,
also from Madrid,

904
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:31,736
Lieutenant Commander Gomez-Beare.

905
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,125
Captain. Commander.

906
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,548
Good to know
we can still reel you gentlemen in

907
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,250
from our far-flung outposts.

908
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,416
Montagu and Cholmondeley
will run the briefing today.

909
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,208
The operation is theirs, and being theirs,
is now theirs to fuck up.

910
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,791
Quite a vote of confidence.

911
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:54,416
Our story begins
in the Spanish fishing port of Huelva

912
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,833
on the Gulf of Cadiz,

913
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:58,000
where Major William Martin,

914
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,916
a British officer
bearing classified letters,

915
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,333
will wash up on shore
after his plane has been tragically lost.

916
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,041
The officer is not an officer.
The papers are false.

917
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,750
The plane crash will not have occurred.

918
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,500
Instead, we will release
our man from a submarine

919
00:49:16,291 --> 00:49:17,750
in order to exploit

920
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:20,083
the Nazi spy trail,
which begins in Huelva,

921
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,958
Don Gomez-Beare's territory,

922
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:24,833
and then moves to Madrid,
Captain Ainsworth's turf,

923
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:27,791
and ends in the heart
of German intelligence,

924
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,750
the Abwehr in Berlin.

925
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,416
We will need to move
these fake documents quickly

926
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,125
with the help
of two key German operatives,

927
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,500
Karl Kuhlenthal in Madrid

928
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:41,791
and his right-hand man
in Huelva, Adolf Clauss.

929
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,208
Clauss is an exceptional spy,

930
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,625
and if a body
washes up in Huelva with papers,

931
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,291
Adolf Clauss
will get his hands on those papers.

932
00:49:49,791 --> 00:49:53,500
Clauss reports
to Karl Kuhlenthal in Madrid,

933
00:49:53,583 --> 00:49:56,208
where Kuhlenthal is seen
as a golden boy by the Abwehr.

934
00:49:56,291 --> 00:50:00,916
But MI5 have found Kuhlenthal
to be a one-man espionage disaster.

935
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,125
Gullible, incompetent,
and he happens to be one-quarter Jewish,

936
00:50:04,708 --> 00:50:08,375
<i>where under Hitler's regime,
even a drop of Jewish blood means death.</i>

937
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:14,208
Although luckily for Kuhlenthal,
he was recently cleared as a good German.

938
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,958
But he is now desperate
to impress his superiors

939
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:20,041
before Berlin remembers
that he is Jewish after all.

940
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:22,875
So, we need Clauss
because he is a good spy

941
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:27,166
and will get the papers,
Kuhlenthal because he is a bad one

942
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,833
and will believe them.

943
00:50:29,333 --> 00:50:32,666
Together, they ensure the best chance
that our documentsÂ will land in Berlin.

944
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,458
Where success
depends on another key figure,

945
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:40,375
Hitler's favorite adviser,
Colonel Alexis von Roenne.

946
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:44,458
<i>Von Roenne controls military
intelligence at Nazi High Command,</i>

947
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,500
<i>and Hitler will not believe anything
without Von Roenne's blessing,</i>

948
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,375
which is a challenge for us
because Von Roenne is brilliant.

949
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:52,750
A real spy's spy.

950
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,750
- Though, there have been rumors...
- And at this point, only rumors.

951
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,958
...that Von Roenne
has turned against the Fuhrer,

952
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,458
<i>and that he
and a group of anti-Nazi plotters</i>

953
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:05,250
<i>are trying to destroy
the Nazi war machine from within.</i>

954
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:09,083
We've heard rumblings
of this anti-Hitler faction before.

955
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:13,208
We judge it to be a ruse
to infiltrate our inner circle,

956
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:14,875
so we will proceed as planned.

957
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:18,583
The prime minister wants all resources
employed to make Mincemeat so convincing

958
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:22,291
that Von Roenne believes it,
Hitler believes it, and even we believe

959
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,500
we are landing in Greece.

960
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:27,916
To that end, we are preparing
the fake documents for the briefcase now.

961
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:33,375
The key one being an off-the-record letter
between Generals Nye and Alexander,

962
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:37,166
and in that letter,
the lie about Greece is planted.

963
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:40,458
Of course we'll get
our letter approved tomorrow,

964
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:43,666
but you simply must sit on Q Branch

965
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,333
to deliver our canister,
and then on to the submarine.

966
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:52,625
- Dear God, what about the submarine?
- "How are you getting on with Eisenhower?"

967
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,791
Cut and dried.
The letter must have a natural tone.

968
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:57,958
"Hope all is well.
The General sends his best."

969
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,375
Hmm, can't have them
cackling like two hens.

970
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:02,541
Archie Nye and Harold Alexander
are old friends.

971
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,916
I've had letters
from the bank manager with more zing.

972
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,125
It's a first draft.

973
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:10,958
And we can't allow personal flourishes
to distract from the military

974
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,000
misinformation we need Hitler to swallow.

975
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,208
No, unless we want to
bore him to death first.

976
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,375
And now, Hester has asked me
if she can write the love letter

977
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,250
we're putting in Major Martin's pocket.

978
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:24,375
She should write it and then
submit it to your withering gaze.

979
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:31,333
Do you know where
Jean stands with Sergeant Dearborn?

980
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:32,708
- The American?
- Yes.

981
00:52:32,791 --> 00:52:34,125
I think she's moved on.

982
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,583
Did she tell you that?

983
00:52:36,833 --> 00:52:39,333
You do see Jean outside of work,
don't you?

984
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:43,291
We will occasionally work over dinner
to iron out Bill-and-Pam details

985
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,125
for verisimilitude's sake.

986
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,291
Verisimilitude.

987
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:48,375
For instance, tonight,

988
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,166
we are placing the ticket stubs

989
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:54,916
as agreed next to
the receipt for Pam's ring

990
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,416
in the major's breast pocket.

991
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,000
Trouser pocket.

992
00:52:58,083 --> 00:53:00,458
His breast pocket
is where he keeps her photograph.

993
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:01,833
Sorry we're late.

994
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,916
It's bedlam out there!

995
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,166
It's true. We're all like moles now,
scurrying around in the dark.

996
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,416
One blind man leadeth another,
both fall in ye ditch.

997
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:23,833
You out again tonight?

998
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:27,833
My reputation as a slouch
must be upheld even in war.

999
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,541
And you? Busy writing away?

1000
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,666
Writing what?

1001
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,458
- Supply requisitions, mostly.
- Aha.

1002
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:44,000
"Do you take the same size hat
or a larger size like Monty's?"

1003
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:45,083
Good, isn't it?

1004
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:48,000
The Spartan general.
Big head, bigger ego.

1005
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:49,582
It's a joke.

1006
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,343
This is
hardly the place for jokes.

1007
00:53:51,416 --> 00:53:54,333
Everyone feels it could do with
alterations and improvements.

1008
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,416
Everyone?

1009
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:58,833
The Twenty Committee, Chiefs of Staff,
Naval Intelligence, Q Branch,

1010
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,166
MI5, MI6.

1011
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:05,083
To retard the decomposition,
the body must be tightly sealed.

1012
00:54:05,583 --> 00:54:09,291
The canister's double skin
will be made from 22-gauge steel,

1013
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:11,208
then insulated with asbestos wool,

1014
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,290
and dry ice.

1015
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,791
Heat and oxygen,

1016
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,833
a corpse's deadly enemies.

1017
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,416
And the watch, what does it do?

1018
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,458
A buzz saw.

1019
00:54:19,541 --> 00:54:21,541
Buzz saw? Is that code for...?

1020
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,083
For buzz saw.

1021
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:26,541
The bezel's edges
are filed into razor-sharp teeth.

1022
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:31,166
<i>âª We'll all be lit up as âª</i>

1023
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,166
<i>âª The Strand was only more, much more âª</i>

1024
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,166
<i>âª And before the plot is played out âª</i>

1025
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,083
<i>âª They will fetch the Fire Brigade out âª</i>

1026
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:46,208
<i>âª To the lit-test up-est scene
You ever saw âª</i>

1027
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,416
So, what I'm asking, Lieutenant Jewell,

1028
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,875
is whether or not your submarine
could accommodate a 6-foot thermos?

1029
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,625
Well, technically, I suppose.

1030
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,541
But my crew on the Seraph are a sharp lot.
What would I tell them?

1031
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:01,916
Tell them it contains a top-secret
meteorological reporting apparatus.

1032
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,320
Sounds like the stuff of fiction.

1033
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,375
You're not a writer as well, are you?

1034
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,041
We're surrounded by them, you know.

1035
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,750
- Germans?
- Writers.

1036
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,083
"Please ask your ADC
to send me some oranges if possible."

1037
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:21,208
General Nye can't be
made to sound like a scrounger,

1038
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,250
even to the Germans.
Especially to the Germans.

1039
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,541
<i>But he does need
to sound like a human,</i>

1040
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:28,250
which is what I have
rather artfully achieved.

1041
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:30,166
Millions of lives are at stake.

1042
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:32,958
The letter will be revised
until everyone is satisfied.

1043
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,541
- Draft?
- Fourteen.

1044
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,166
With the day still young.

1045
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,250
We're out of time.

1046
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:44,000
Jewell can hold the submarine
for the next fortnight only.

1047
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,458
The Seraph is in Scotland,
docked at the Holy Loch.

1048
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:47,666
Not Siberia?

1049
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,583
You know the irony
of this preposterous stalemate

1050
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:55,208
is if Archie Nye were
composing this letter himself,

1051
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:58,541
he'd write it any damn way... he pleased.

1052
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,750
It's dull as ditchwater.

1053
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:11,458
General Nye is dull as ditchwater,
which is why a charmless and

1054
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:13,708
utterly boring letter is perfect.

1055
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:17,666
And the general was only too happy
to put pen to paper once I asked.

1056
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:19,625
Far be it for me to point out,

1057
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:22,791
but his version is a near carbon copy
of my very first draft.

1058
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:26,375
There is a chain of command,
and for you to go directly to Nye...

1059
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,208
Whatever punishment you deem fit, sir,
I will fully accept.

1060
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:32,708
Although General Nye did ask
why we hadn't come to him straight away.

1061
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,041
Admiral, Major Martin is overripe

1062
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,541
and must be launched on April the 30th,

1063
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:43,083
the next waning moon,
only two weeks away, and the only window

1064
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,916
where we have access to the Seraph.

1065
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,208
And in keeping
with the chain of command,

1066
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:49,916
it is you alone who can
grant us approval to proceed.

1067
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:59,750
To the most satisfying moment...

1068
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:01,666
Here, here.

1069
00:57:02,041 --> 00:57:03,083
...of the last two months!

1070
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,375
- Cheers.
- Cheers to us.

1071
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:08,416
And Pam's letter, Hester,
how many revisions has that gone through?

1072
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,250
Oh, many, but I think
I finished a passable version today.

1073
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:14,142
Well then, we must hear it. Ladies
and gentleman, we have a love letter.

1074
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:16,851
It's your moment to shine, Hester,
a dry run before Fritz has a look.

1075
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:20,625
- Oh, I'm not one for the spotlight.
- Oh, what spotlight, Hes? It's just us.

1076
00:57:21,666 --> 00:57:23,708
- Oh, no, I can't.
- Yes, you can,

1077
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:24,791
please, please.

1078
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,166
- Please.
- Well, if you're all so keen.

1079
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,833
- Yes, we are.
- We are.

1080
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:42,125
You read it.

1081
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,416
The Manor House.

1082
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,375
Marlborough, Wiltshire, Sunday 18th.

1083
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:07,875
"My dearest Bill,

1084
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:11,541
I think seeing
one's beloved off at the railway

1085
00:58:11,625 --> 00:58:13,458
is the poorest form of sport."

1086
00:58:14,166 --> 00:58:17,333
"A train going out
can leave a howling gap in one's days,

1087
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,541
and one has to try madly

1088
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:23,333
and quite in vain to fill it
with the things one used to enjoy."

1089
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,166
"Why did we have to meet
in the middle of a war?"

1090
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:33,708
"For if it weren't for this madness,
we might be married by now,

1091
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:37,625
and I wouldn't be in this
dreary office typing minutes all day."

1092
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:43,125
"That last lovely
golden day we spent together,

1093
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,625
I never wanted it to end."

1094
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,000
"And I know it has been said before,

1095
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:53,666
but I do wish that time could stand still,

1096
00:58:54,541 --> 00:58:56,166
even for just a minute."

1097
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:01,750
"So don't let them
send you off into the blue

1098
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:05,041
the horrible way they do these days."

1099
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:09,916
"Now that we've found
each other out of the whole world,

1100
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,875
I don't think I could bear it."

1101
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,416
"All my love...

1102
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:18,458
Pam."

1103
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:23,750
Wait.

1104
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:26,875
You have an eyelash.

1105
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,666
I'll see you tomorrow.

1106
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:52,583
For you from upstairs.

1107
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:19,416
So you agree, then.

1108
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,041
Ivor Montagu is spying for the Russians.

1109
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:25,291
His file would
seem to indicate that he is.

1110
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,953
He hasn't revealed
Mincemeat to the Soviets.

1111
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,125
We would have
picked it up at Bletchley if he had.

1112
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:31,648
Now that's not to say that he won't.

1113
01:00:31,708 --> 01:00:35,000
There is nothing to suggest that
Ewen discusses anything with his brother.

1114
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:36,750
And nothing to prove that he doesn't.

1115
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:41,166
Now, we could send Ewen to America
to be with his wife and children.

1116
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,875
Might make it easier
to keep an eye on his brother.

1117
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,726
You'll get the credit for Mincemeat,
should it succeed.

1118
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,416
It was your idea, after all.

1119
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:50,625
Or,

1120
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,791
we could keep him here.

1121
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,875
You are asking me
to spy on a man I work beside every day.

1122
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:00,333
I'm asking you
to assess the danger to your country.

1123
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,625
You also have a brother, don't you?

1124
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,583
Had a brother. Fallen in Chittagong.

1125
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:10,833
Hmm. And your mother is desperate
to have his body brought home.

1126
01:01:14,083 --> 01:01:17,625
I've knocked on many doors, but...
so far, nothing.

1127
01:01:19,416 --> 01:01:20,416
Until now.

1128
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:27,833
Fold the letter,

1129
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,541
but each fold only once.

1130
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,583
Then we'll photograph the folds.
If the letter is returned,

1131
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:37,708
the wear to the fibers will show
whether or not it's been opened.

1132
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:41,250
Then the eyelash idea,
which is a good one.

1133
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:42,791
What eyelash idea?

1134
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:44,750
We place an eyelash in the fold.

1135
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,708
If the lash is gone upon return, well,
it's another sign the letter's been read.

1136
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:53,541
The bigger worry is ensuring
that the letter arrives in Berlin.

1137
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,533
If it lands with the Spanish Navy,
there's a good chance

1138
01:01:57,583 --> 01:02:00,083
they could return it to us
unopened and unread.

1139
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:02,166
That's if the letter arrives
in Spain at all.

1140
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,500
It's a big sea.

1141
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:07,166
Many detours await one little briefcase.

1142
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,125
Pam's letter?

1143
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:14,500
New love, so...

1144
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,375
handled, worn.

1145
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,125
And the photograph?

1146
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,041
And the briefcase?

1147
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,875
Let's slide him in and seal him up.

1148
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,750
He doesn't look like a driver for MI5.

1149
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,000
Looks like Errol Flynn.

1150
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,583
And what drink is he on, his fifth?

1151
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,708
Sixth, I think.

1152
01:03:06,791 --> 01:03:09,375
Last round, Teddy,
and then we really must cut him off.

1153
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,916
It'll be
an interesting drive to Scotland.

1154
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,416
You should give Jock Horsfall a wink.

1155
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:18,208
He may be pickled, but he's also single.

1156
01:03:18,708 --> 01:03:20,708
Except, you're seeing Roger.

1157
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:24,458
No, I haven't seen much of Roger,

1158
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:26,291
now we're so busy.

1159
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,833
- We were just friends.
- Ah, oh well.

1160
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,541
His loss.

1161
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:33,541
See you tomorrow.

1162
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,375
So, Jock,

1163
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:46,000
how many times
have you made the trip to Holy Loch?

1164
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,083
Oh, I can do it with my eyes closed.

1165
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:52,333
I sometimes have to if my
astigmatism is playing up.

1166
01:03:52,416 --> 01:03:54,333
But dead of night's a jolly time to drive,

1167
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:59,000
and you'll have my van. Customized V8.
She can run upwards of 125 miles per hour.

1168
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:00,683
I was there, you know, when you thrashed

1169
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:02,791
those six BMWs at Donington Park.

1170
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:04,916
That was my Black Car.

1171
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,416
MI5 made me garage her

1172
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:11,416
now that I'm an official chauffeur.

1173
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:14,250
They say she's a menace on the road.

1174
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,083
But I do miss her.

1175
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:26,250
I'll give you a moment.

1176
01:04:29,375 --> 01:04:33,750
So, this tin can of yours.
What's in it?

1177
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,583
Hmm? Oh, optical equipment.

1178
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:37,666
Bollocks.

1179
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,333
Do you know how high my clearance goes?

1180
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,333
It's a dead body.

1181
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:47,333
We're going to play
a humiliating trick on Hitler.

1182
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:55,916
- Is he even capable of driving now?
- I fear we're about to find out.

1183
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:58,916
Anyway, um,

1184
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:01,750
since it's Major Martin's last night.

1185
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:26,291
Seems strange, doesn't it?
Sending our dear Major off to die?

1186
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,916
You do know he's already dead.

1187
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,416
In a way, yes, but in another,
he's very much alive,

1188
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
our clever, dashing man.

1189
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:37,833
Which is why I'd like
to thank you, Charles.

1190
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:39,750
It's been a grand adventure.

1191
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,291
For the two of you.

1192
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,791
For all of us.

1193
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:48,666
We gave Bill a life.

1194
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:51,833
One Glyndwr Michael never had.

1195
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,500
We gave him Pam.

1196
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:58,291
I wanted Pam.

1197
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,583
I only mean

1198
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,708
that our imaginings
often surpass what is real, don't they?

1199
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:14,000
I come home every night to a bereft mother

1200
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,916
pining for her favorite son.

1201
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,208
Hester lives the spinster's life,

1202
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:21,000
working around the clock
rather than face an empty bed.

1203
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,750
Ewen's real life is off in America,

1204
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:27,691
where he must worry
about the safety of his wife and children

1205
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,875
until they return.

1206
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,166
Or did he not mention that to you?

1207
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:36,500
He said something about America.

1208
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:42,583
It's all a game

1209
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,500
to him, you know?

1210
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,250
You do know that.

1211
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,333
All the

1212
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:50,125
dinners and dancing.

1213
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:52,833
Not that I blame him.

1214
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:56,875
Who wouldn't want the attentions
of a beautiful woman? But, um...

1215
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:02,666
There's even talk of Ewen
joining Iris and the children in America.

1216
01:07:03,458 --> 01:07:05,958
Family should be together during wartime,

1217
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:07,666
don't you think?

1218
01:07:09,583 --> 01:07:12,458
I think I stepped on your toe.

1219
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:15,375
Oh, well, at least it wasn't me for once.

1220
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,583
Got such a busy day tomorrow.

1221
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,000
I really must go.

1222
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,500
Jean.

1223
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,583
- Jean, you're not leaving.
- I am, obviously.

1224
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:35,666
But why?

1225
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,958
Jean, what just happened?

1226
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:42,875
I have been overcome
with embarrassment at my own stupidity.

1227
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:46,208
This game we've been playing.

1228
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,250
Bill and Pam, the young lovers,
as if you and I were...

1229
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,375
as if this weren't a real war.

1230
01:07:54,125 --> 01:07:56,750
Do you not realize
people are talking about us?

1231
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,083
Is this about gossip?

1232
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:00,958
What... what does it matter
what people say?

1233
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:02,750
We both know there's
nothing going on here.

1234
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,208
I don't... I don't mean nothing, as in...

1235
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:14,000
I left behind childish games
many years ago, Ewen.

1236
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,916
The day I buried the man I loved.

1237
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:22,333
And while my life
may not look like much to you,

1238
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:25,375
I have made my way, alone

1239
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:28,833
with the occasional
admirer to pass the time.

1240
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:32,375
It's certainly easier

1241
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,750
and safer.

1242
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,291
So...

1243
01:08:39,291 --> 01:08:41,041
You'll be late for your drive,

1244
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,041
and I'm going home.

1245
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,291
No dallying, ladies.

1246
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:02,333
We've a clock to beat.

1247
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:05,500
And we'll have to feel our way along,
thanks to the blackout.

1248
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:08,458
I saw you talking to Jean tonight.

1249
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:10,375
What were you saying?

1250
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,583
I was apologizing

1251
01:09:12,083 --> 01:09:13,250
for my dancing.

1252
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:20,041
It's easier to accept death
when you can't see it coming.

1253
01:09:58,625 --> 01:09:59,625
It's curious

1254
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:02,416
about your brother.

1255
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,333
My brother?

1256
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,375
You never speak of him.
He does live with you, doesn't he?

1257
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:11,708
He travels mostly.

1258
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,125
Although, I'm not sure
why that's any of your business.

1259
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,833
Or why you would
say something to upset Jean tonight.

1260
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:23,916
Godfrey thinks Ivor's a communist.

1261
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,458
- You've spoken to Godfrey about Ivor?
- Godfrey brought him up.

1262
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,333
Well, Godfrey despises eccentrics.

1263
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,875
Aren't all spies eccentrics?

1264
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:36,083
Ivor is a dilettante,

1265
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:40,000
an inveterate ne'er-do-well who founded
the Cheese Eaters League in Cambridge

1266
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,833
and the International
Table Tennis Federation in London.

1267
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:45,333
And his trips to Moscow?

1268
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:48,875
My brother joined
the British Socialist Party

1269
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:52,583
for five minutes, about as long as
his interest in anything lasts.

1270
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,583
Down here!

1271
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:26,666
Excellent timing!

1272
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,291
Well ahead of schedule.

1273
01:11:30,333 --> 01:11:33,250
But then I'd expect nothing less
from his Majesty's finest.

1274
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:34,333
Finest what?

1275
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:37,750
I think my testicles dislodged
somewhere near Dumfries.

1276
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,708
And good news, Lieutenant.

1277
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:43,625
I was able to honor your request.

1278
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,166
Much appreciated.
I know it was last-minute. Thank you.

1279
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,333
What request?

1280
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:50,666
Jewell was good enough
to find me a bunk on the Seraph.

1281
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,416
What do you mean "on the Seraph"?

1282
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,666
Someone should accompany Major Martin
to his final resting place.

1283
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,708
- That would be Spain.
- Yes, where the Seraph is headed.

1284
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:00,500
Are you out of your mind?

1285
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:02,708
We didn't get clearance
to go to Spain with him.

1286
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:03,833
We didn't even discuss it.

1287
01:12:03,916 --> 01:12:07,958
Don't you think that one of us should show
some respect for a man who gave his life

1288
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:10,625
and who now serves us
and his country so nobly?

1289
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:11,958
If unwittingly.

1290
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:15,916
Don't you think at least one of us
ought to do the right thing?

1291
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:24,875
We're going straight through
back to London.

1292
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,375
Now!

1293
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:28,541
I'm driving.

1294
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:05,041
Do you know what time it is?

1295
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:06,791
I just need a moment.

1296
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:13,416
There's an apology I must make to you,
and then I promise I'll go.

1297
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:17,791
I wasn't being honest with you

1298
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:21,916
or even myself
when I said there's nothing between us.

1299
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,541
In fact, the very opposite is true.

1300
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,916
My life is complicated.

1301
01:13:32,666 --> 01:13:36,500
It's not an excuse
or a defense or anything, really.

1302
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:39,500
Only to say...

1303
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,541
that my feelings for you are real.

1304
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:51,833
I should have
realized that a long time ago.

1305
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:58,333
And perhaps I might have spared you
the embarrassment of last night,

1306
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:01,333
because if I in any way...

1307
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:02,583
You didn't.

1308
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:06,750
I know you have a wife and family.

1309
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:10,625
I do.

1310
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:14,833
And you and I,

1311
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,916
we have a war to win.

1312
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:21,958
Major Martin is in dangerous waters now.

1313
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,708
He'll need us more than ever.

1314
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,916
I hope you're able to sleep.

1315
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,583
I left my Bible below deck, so...

1316
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,125
In the twinkling of an eye,

1317
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:17,166
at the last call,

1318
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:20,416
for the trumpet shall sound,

1319
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:24,500
<i>and the dead
shall be raised incorruptible.</i>

1320
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,750
<i>And we shall all be changed.</i>

1321
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,666
Have we heard anything?

1322
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,750
Not yet.

1323
01:16:46,125 --> 01:16:48,416
I thought I might take a moment.

1324
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,541
Say a prayer to St. Jude.

1325
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:58,208
Should we pray for Major Martin?

1326
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:02,333
For Major Martin.

1327
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,708
For the success of our mission.

1328
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,291
For those we love.

1329
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:50,916
Marco!

1330
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,291
- What?
- Listen...

1331
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:25,000
<i>And so, the hidden war continues.</i>

1332
01:18:29,875 --> 01:18:32,000
<i>Lies are whispered anew.</i>

1333
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:35,750
<i>Shadows still flicker.</i>

1334
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:42,041
<i>Even the ground refuses
to steady in this wilderness of illusions.</i>

1335
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:49,333
<i>A man dies.</i>

1336
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:53,833
<i>Another begins his journey</i>

1337
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:58,375
<i>and waits for his story to be told.</i>

1338
01:19:02,041 --> 01:19:04,125
<i>But in the conventional war,</i>

1339
01:19:04,208 --> 01:19:06,208
<i>the wheels of combat turn</i>,

1340
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,916
<i>the forces of men
and machines swell until suddenly</i>

1341
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:13,000
<i>the die is cast.</i>

1342
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,875
<i>There is no turning back.</i>

1343
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,750
U.S., Canadian,
and British forces will strike

1344
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,083
26 beaches over 100 miles

1345
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,083
of Sicily's southern shore.

1346
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:26,166
We'll be mobilizing 100,000 plus men,

1347
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:30,500
3,000 freighters and sweepers
with 1,800 heavy guns, 4,000 aircraft...

1348
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:32,916
Commander, if I may.
Does the build-up continue

1349
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,166
despite our intelligence?

1350
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:38,166
Intelligence that shows
Germans continue to reinforce Sicily.

1351
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:40,250
The prime minister still
hopes to turn the tide

1352
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:42,666
and convince Germany
that our target is Greece.

1353
01:19:43,916 --> 01:19:46,750
He is now relying almost entirely on us,

1354
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:48,833
so we have work to do.

1355
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,500
- Morning Charles.
- Morning.

1356
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:58,916
Charles.

1357
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:01,875
- You don't look any the worse for wear.
- I should.

1358
01:20:01,958 --> 01:20:04,833
There's a reason tall men
don't serve on small submarines.

1359
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,750
Hitler's still reinforcing Sicily.

1360
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:15,559
That can only mean
the other pieces of our deception plan...

1361
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:16,583
Have missed the mark.

1362
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,666
But Major Martin has washed ashore.

1363
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:22,125
Gomez-Beare has been
called by the Spanish police.

1364
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:24,000
Our plan proceeds.

1365
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:28,458
The fate of the Free World
dependent on a corpse and a donkey cart.

1366
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,000
All good.

1367
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,125
...from Cardiff MartÃ­n Willy.

1368
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,583
HUELVA ROMAN CATHOLIC CEMETERY

1369
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:42,708
And then look
what is inside that bag, please.

1370
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:46,541
Thanks for notifying me
a comrade of mine has fallen.

1371
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:50,458
I'm Judge Pascual del Pobil,
instructor of the Spanish Navy.

1372
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:56,291
I guess that would be
a complicated case for a local forensic.

1373
01:20:56,375 --> 01:20:58,750
I'm Dr. del Torno,
provisional forensic

1374
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:02,333
and head of pathologic anatomy
department at a university in Madrid.

1375
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:03,916
The local forensic died.

1376
01:21:04,916 --> 01:21:08,041
By the way,
I fired the local police of Huelva.

1377
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:11,916
They are corrupted
and controlled by the Nazis.

1378
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,833
I will take care of this personally.

1379
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:18,291
It is clear that your naval officer
was floating in water for quite some time.

1380
01:21:18,375 --> 01:21:21,309
The critical task now is
to make the Germans think we are frantic

1381
01:21:21,333 --> 01:21:24,500
to reclaim the papers, while guiding
the papers right into their hands.

1382
01:21:24,583 --> 01:21:27,250
Since his personal objects
belong to the British government,

1383
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:28,708
you can take them with you.

1384
01:21:30,416 --> 01:21:32,083
Me? Take them now?

1385
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:36,541
Yes. No need to go through my superiors,
Commander Gomez-Beare.

1386
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,833
The papers are yours
to return to your king.

1387
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,309
<i>On the ground,
our Assistant Naval AttachÃ©,</i>

1388
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,517
Don Gomez-Beare, is with
the body now and will make sure

1389
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,125
the documents get to the German police.

1390
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:50,291
Also known as the Spanish police.

1391
01:21:50,375 --> 01:21:52,375
I appreciate the offer.

1392
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:54,333
But there is a protocol,

1393
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:56,541
and we both know
the minds of naval superiors.

1394
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,125
Do you know mine?

1395
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:01,666
- Admiral Moreno?
- Moreno is a hopeless nitpicker.

1396
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,916
Moreno is a pain in the ass.

1397
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,500
So why rouse the beast?

1398
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:11,708
Better to gather the papers
and keep them here for safe-keeping,

1399
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:14,291
give a full report to Moreno later,
then return them to me.

1400
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,708
We could. But it is hot.

1401
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:18,750
Your man stinks.

1402
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,291
And lunch and a siesta
are only moments away.

1403
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:24,625
But they are watching, are they not?

1404
01:22:26,916 --> 01:22:28,125
Those men.

1405
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:34,166
Fine, if you insist. The papers will go

1406
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,916
to our Naval Office in Huelva.

1407
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,208
In the meantime,
dear coroner, make this quick.

1408
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:44,333
I see no reason to rush.

1409
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:47,666
I specialized in drownings at the Academy,

1410
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,791
so I find this case of great interest.

1411
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:54,625
Specialized in drownings?

1412
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:58,750
Yes. If this case even <i>is </i>a drowning.

1413
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,166
<i>Once the autopsy is complete,</i>

1414
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:05,250
we'll work our end through David Ainsworth
at the British Embassy in Madrid.

1415
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,573
British Admiralty on the phone.

1416
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:09,833
The Germans have bugged the phones there,
so any message weÂ pass to the embassy

1417
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:11,500
is essentially a message to Berlin.

1418
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:14,208
Oh, they asked that you
use the unsecured line.

1419
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:16,833
Ainsworth.

1420
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:19,500
- <i>Captain, is your line secure?
- </i>Of course.

1421
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,708
<i>Good, 'cause we've
just received news</i>

1422
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:23,500
that one of ours washed up in Huelva.

1423
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,250
<i>Carrying top-secret documents</i>

1424
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,625
<i>General Nye's camp is
very anxious to recover.</i>

1425
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:29,583
I'll begin inquiries right away.

1426
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:32,083
<i>And the fact
that we're looking for papers at all</i>

1427
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:33,333
<i>must remain classified.</i>

1428
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:34,875
Understood.

1429
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:46,083
Doctor, our man here has clearly drowned.

1430
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:48,791
His body has given up the ghost,
I think we can agree.

1431
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:53,583
There is only one decent thing
we can do now for his poor sodden soul.

1432
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:58,791
The burial is set for 0800 hours tomorrow?

1433
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:01,500
<i>Only because
the expert pathologist from Madrid</i>

1434
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:05,250
nixed the autopsy, thank Christ,
and not a moment too soon.

1435
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:09,833
The bad news is the Spanish Navy
in Huelva has the case under lock and key.

1436
01:24:09,916 --> 01:24:12,875
Then our only hope is
helping Adolf Clauss get his hands on it.

1437
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:16,083
Before the case makes its way
to Admiral Moreno's office in Madrid.

1438
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:18,666
Well, the dung beetle
will surface soon enough.

1439
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,430
<i>Nope, we need him
to surface sooner.</i>

1440
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:24,041
We'll jolt him with an unencrypted cable
sent to your office tonight.

1441
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:26,958
Make casual request to Spanish Navy

1442
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:30,583
to return case and papers. Stop.

1443
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:33,041
Do not alert German interests

1444
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:36,250
<i>to the necessity of securing</i>

1445
01:24:36,333 --> 01:24:39,791
<i>these documents back
into British hands, stop.</i>

1446
01:24:40,291 --> 01:24:43,083
Unless you expect
a thank you from Herr Clauss,

1447
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,958
I think our work here tonight is done.

1448
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,375
Get the list through.
In the morning...

1449
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:07,000
I just saw the name Montagu.

1450
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:09,875
Ewen's wife, Iris.

1451
01:25:10,916 --> 01:25:12,291
She and I correspond.

1452
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:15,291
We've known each other
for years, of course.

1453
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,500
Jean!

1454
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:36,125
Jean!

1455
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:40,583
Goodness! Roger!

1456
01:25:40,666 --> 01:25:42,875
I am so sorry. I've been meaning to...

1457
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:45,958
No, no. It's okay.
I'm just disappointed since

1458
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,916
it feels like I barely
got to say hello to you,

1459
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,791
and now I have to say goodbye.

1460
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:54,791
The boys and I are
shipping out in the morning.

1461
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,583
In the morning?

1462
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:59,958
- Where?
- I'm not at liberty to say, but, uh...

1463
01:26:00,458 --> 01:26:03,500
Well, I don't know
when we'll see each other again, so...

1464
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:08,833
Wherever it is, Roger,
I do hope you'll be safe.

1465
01:26:09,416 --> 01:26:11,041
May I write to you?

1466
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,375
Of course.

1467
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:14,958
Please write.

1468
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:24,708
Goodbye.

1469
01:26:39,083 --> 01:26:42,458
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1470
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:43,541
Amen.

1471
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,083
Jesus Christ...

1472
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,458
It will be my funeral next.

1473
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:53,625
I should've taken that
bloody briefcase when I had the chance.

1474
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,208
My superiors are frantic for it.

1475
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,958
Perhaps the case is already en route.

1476
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:02,541
To where? Have you heard gossip?

1477
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:07,083
This is a small town, Lieutenant.
Treacherously small.

1478
01:27:07,583 --> 01:27:09,500
The chair maker
has been asking questions.

1479
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,040
Adolf.

1480
01:27:14,041 --> 01:27:15,541
What a pleasant surprise.

1481
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:19,708
Quite the turnout for our man.

1482
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,541
<i>So, Adolf Clauss
turned out to be two steps behind...</i>

1483
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:31,333
...because the briefcase
has landed in Madrid.

1484
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,541
Dear God.

1485
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:35,916
<i>Which means it will be
in Admiral Moreno's office shortly.</i>

1486
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,708
But let's hope
that Kuhlenthal can't be far behind.

1487
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:42,041
<i>And since we've bugged
every office in Naval Headquarters...</i>

1488
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:43,375
Not every office. Not Moreno's.

1489
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,098
- Admiral Moreno.
- Come with me, please.

1490
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:48,875
<i>We need to know
what Moreno's up to,</i>

1491
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:50,833
<i>David, so you'll have to improvise.</i>

1492
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:53,000
Time to look up old friends.

1493
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,125
I need to hear
that conversation.

1494
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,500
I've missed you, Captain.

1495
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:24,541
<i>I heard
the whole conversation.</i>

1496
01:28:24,625 --> 01:28:26,666
<i>Moreno denied having the papers</i>,

1497
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,125
while Kuhlenthal
insisted he did have the papers.

1498
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,833
Did Kuhlenthal get hold of the case?

1499
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:34,125
Unfortunately not.

1500
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,041
<i>Moreno wasn't open for business.</i>

1501
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:40,000
Dear God! It's hard to see who's more
up a tree with this, us or the Germans.

1502
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:42,458
I would say Kuhlenthal is
desperate enough for us all.

1503
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:47,750
The bug in his office caught him
eviscerating Clauss for not

1504
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,416
snatching the papers in Huelva.

1505
01:28:51,333 --> 01:28:52,583
<i>So he should.</i>

1506
01:28:52,666 --> 01:28:55,559
And the Spanish Navy can't seem to
stop reminding us how neutral they are.

1507
01:28:55,583 --> 01:28:57,726
They won't let the Germans
anywhere near our briefcase.

1508
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,000
Colonel CerrutiÂ could
get hold of the papers.

1509
01:29:00,083 --> 01:29:01,083
Cerruti?

1510
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,583
Spain's secret police
are beyond treacherous.

1511
01:29:03,666 --> 01:29:06,416
<i>They are, but he's
a keen fascist. He's devoted to Hitler.</i>

1512
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,000
<i>And we have no other choice.
We have to get the papers to Kuhlenthal.</i>

1513
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:13,250
<i>Colonel Cerruti
ran me as a double agent years ago</i>

1514
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:16,125
<i>without ever realizing
I was a triple agent for our side.</i>

1515
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:19,041
But I've steered clear
of the Colonel for some time now.

1516
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:20,125
<i>He's gone dry?</i>

1517
01:29:20,208 --> 01:29:21,458
<i>He requires</i>

1518
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:23,666
careful handling.

1519
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,910
Are you here
because you missed me, David?

1520
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:29,625
We sympathize, David,
but Churchill has put his money on us.

1521
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:32,916
We cannot tell the prime minister
that we've hit a dead end now.

1522
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:42,333
I am here, Colonel,
out of our shared duty to the Fuhrer.

1523
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:48,708
Admiral Moreno insists
they know nothing of British documents

1524
01:29:49,625 --> 01:29:52,791
we know are in his possession.

1525
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:57,458
Papers the Fuhrer needs to see.

1526
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:03,375
And what is in the documents?

1527
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:09,041
Something the British
are very keen to hide.

1528
01:30:12,208 --> 01:30:15,875
Now, I know Moreno is incorruptible...

1529
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:19,041
but in your hands...

1530
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,333
And what of your hands?

1531
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:53,458
I need some air.

1532
01:31:57,541 --> 01:32:01,541
There's no mention of Cerruti
or Kuhlenthal in any of these transcripts.

1533
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:03,625
We don't know if Cerruti met with Moreno,

1534
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:05,958
or if he even took the case,
or if he read the letter.

1535
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:08,208
We are utterly in the dark.

1536
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:11,041
Is that what
Charles and M were discussing?

1537
01:32:11,916 --> 01:32:13,583
Charles and Godfrey?

1538
01:32:13,666 --> 01:32:14,582
When?

1539
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:17,583
Yesterday. I saw them
outside talking alone.

1540
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,125
And you're telling me this now?

1541
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:21,416
I wasn't aware
I was supposed to tell you

1542
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,750
or anyone.

1543
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,083
He can be like this
when he's under pressure.

1544
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:31,000
You mustn't take it personally.

1545
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:33,625
The waiting's driving us all mad.

1546
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:39,708
Why does Ewen's wife write to you

1547
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:41,583
and not to him?

1548
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,166
Every marriage has its

1549
01:32:49,666 --> 01:32:51,625
difficulties and disappointments.

1550
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:55,250
Haven't we all had our
hearts broken over the years?

1551
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,791
What's hard to understand about Ewen,

1552
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,500
hidden beneath all the bluster

1553
01:33:02,375 --> 01:33:04,958
is his very deep sense of duty.

1554
01:33:06,833 --> 01:33:08,125
I only say this

1555
01:33:08,791 --> 01:33:10,958
because I'm so very fond of you

1556
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:12,583
and him.

1557
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:15,375
And her.

1558
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:26,333
Moreno's on his way to the embassy.

1559
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:29,541
And Kuhlenthal has just left for Berlin.

1560
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:32,838
<i>Captain,
this traveling case</i>

1561
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:34,083
<i>has come into our possession.</i>

1562
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,625
We don't know its contents.

1563
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:40,333
We do know it's the property
of the British government.

1564
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,920
And at times like these, with countries
at war and allegiances so fragile,

1565
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:46,666
Spain wishes to see
its safe return to its owner.

1566
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:50,125
Thank you very much.

1567
01:33:54,041 --> 01:33:57,000
So, the moment of truth.

1568
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,041
The seal hasn't been touched.

1569
01:34:09,541 --> 01:34:11,250
Meaning the letter hasn't been read.

1570
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:13,291
Let's not hang ourselves just yet.

1571
01:34:13,791 --> 01:34:15,791
One can, with great delicacy,

1572
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:18,375
remove a letter without
fully opening the envelope.

1573
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:21,333
If the gum has been dissolved
in solvent.

1574
01:34:21,414 --> 01:34:22,414
Or seawater.

1575
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:24,250
Yes. Yes, seawater.

1576
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:34,166
It is possible to insert here,

1577
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:38,500
grab the edge of the letter,
and then, ever so gently... twist.

1578
01:34:38,583 --> 01:34:40,750
So it is possible they removed the letter?

1579
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:44,666
Twisting like this
causes the pages to curl,

1580
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:46,958
but, uh, once back
in the envelope, of course,

1581
01:34:47,041 --> 01:34:48,166
the letter will lie flat.

1582
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,958
So how is a curl we cannot see helpful?

1583
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:55,375
Um, it isn't. It... It isn't.

1584
01:34:55,958 --> 01:34:59,250
Unless we wet the paper again,
dry it, and see what happens.

1585
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,958
It looks as if the eyelash is gone.

1586
01:35:02,958 --> 01:35:07,000
We are not sending 100,000 men
into battle on a missing eyelash.

1587
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,500
So it has been opened.

1588
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:19,916
This letter has been removed
from the envelope, and it has been opened.

1589
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,458
Which means it's been read.

1590
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:50,750
Teddy!

1591
01:35:51,625 --> 01:35:52,833
What on earth...

1592
01:35:52,916 --> 01:35:54,541
- Why?
- Why am I not at the club?

1593
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:56,125
I don't work there anymore.

1594
01:35:57,916 --> 01:35:59,250
Strange, isn't it?

1595
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:04,875
To find an old photograph of you
amongst Major Martin's papers.

1596
01:36:06,208 --> 01:36:08,625
I don't recall seeing him
at the Gargoyle, Jean.

1597
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:12,208
Or, do I call you Pam?

1598
01:36:22,083 --> 01:36:23,083
"Dearest Bill,

1599
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:26,166
why did we have to meet
in the middle of a war?"

1600
01:36:26,958 --> 01:36:29,125
"For if it
weren't for this madness,

1601
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,250
we might have been married by now."

1602
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:34,375
I don't understand what you're doing.

1603
01:36:34,458 --> 01:36:35,541
There are Germans,

1604
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,500
good Germans,

1605
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:40,291
in positions of great influence

1606
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:43,458
that are allied
in their desire to see the Fuhrer fall.

1607
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:49,750
But these men
have been rebuffed by your superiors,

1608
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:52,250
labeled "the anti-Hitler hoax,"

1609
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:55,083
which is a shame
since we both are on the same side.

1610
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:03,250
My German friends need
to understand what's happened here.

1611
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:08,791
So, you will tell me about
Major Martin and the letters in his case,

1612
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:11,625
or I will pull out my gun
and put a bullet in your head.

1613
01:37:30,208 --> 01:37:31,208
We just got this,

1614
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:34,041
the latest intercept sent
by General Jodl,

1615
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:37,250
Nazi Chief of Operations.
It says, and I quote,

1616
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:41,500
"Enemy landings
on a large scale are expected in Greece

1617
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,833
in the very near future." In Greece.

1618
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:46,708
It came through
at the highest level of encryption.

1619
01:37:47,208 --> 01:37:48,208
Do we believe this?

1620
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:51,208
General Jodl.

1621
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:53,638
We couldn't ask for
a more credible source.

1622
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:56,375
And if the Nazis were
moving troops from Sicily to Greece,

1623
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:58,333
it would be Jodl that's moving them.

1624
01:38:06,166 --> 01:38:07,166
Q Branch.

1625
01:38:08,416 --> 01:38:09,583
Yes. Yes, he is.

1626
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:13,416
Yes, I'll tell him right away.

1627
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:18,333
The man served us drinks
every night, Ewen! It was your club!

1628
01:38:18,416 --> 01:38:20,476
You don't think
I vetted every single employee

1629
01:38:20,500 --> 01:38:21,708
in and out of the Gargoyle?

1630
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:24,625
You don't think I'm aware of everyone
around me who might be listening?

1631
01:38:24,708 --> 01:38:26,666
Well, you know,
we can't ask Teddy what happened

1632
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:28,958
because his flat's been searched,
and he's vanished!

1633
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:31,726
Every Nazi operative
within our borders has either been turned

1634
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:32,750
or eliminated long ago.

1635
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:35,791
We monitor everyone who might
remotely constitute a fifth column.

1636
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:37,333
We have eyes on every Blackshirt.

1637
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:39,333
Well then, who is this man?
Who is he?

1638
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,625
Jean, are you sure
that he didn't give you a name?

1639
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:48,916
He didn't indicate
who might have sent him?

1640
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:49,914
Just,

1641
01:38:49,916 --> 01:38:52,166
Just the Germans fighting against Hitler.

1642
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,958
- I assumed it was a lie.
- It most likely was a lie.

1643
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:57,601
Well, he was trying to get you to talk.

1644
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,208
But I did talk.

1645
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:02,750
I said, yes, I worked at the Admiralty.

1646
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:05,070
And the officer that died,

1647
01:39:05,125 --> 01:39:08,083
he was using an alias
traveling with a fake dossier.

1648
01:39:08,166 --> 01:39:09,166
He was a spy.

1649
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:13,166
But that he was also
transporting real classified material,

1650
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:15,291
real letters.

1651
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:17,208
It was ridiculous, but

1652
01:39:17,291 --> 01:39:19,958
- what could I say?
- He had the photograph.

1653
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:22,208
I gave you that photograph.

1654
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:23,750
Jean, this is not your fault.

1655
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:25,833
But they know
the photograph isn't real.

1656
01:39:25,916 --> 01:39:27,583
They'll suspect everything now.

1657
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:29,500
We don't even know who <i>they </i>are.

1658
01:39:30,666 --> 01:39:32,125
You're not safe here.

1659
01:39:33,208 --> 01:39:36,458
I have a guestroom. You can
stay there until we all sort this out.

1660
01:39:45,458 --> 01:39:47,500
You would bring her to your own house?

1661
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:50,583
Have you no shame after you've
jeopardized this entire operation?

1662
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:51,746
You approached Jean.

1663
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,875
You're the one
who insisted on using her photograph!

1664
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:56,875
You're so busy seducing her that you
took your eye off your own brother.

1665
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:58,478
You think I told Ivor about Mincemeat?

1666
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:00,958
- How do we know he's not behind this?
- I tell him nothing!

1667
01:40:01,041 --> 01:40:03,541
Because you know he's
a spy in bed with the Russians!

1668
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:05,875
Don't you tell me
what I know and don't know.

1669
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:09,041
You don't think I imagine myself
at his funeral every day?

1670
01:40:09,125 --> 01:40:11,458
My own brother,
tried and hanged for treason.

1671
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:12,708
How fucking dare you?

1672
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:15,125
I am not the one who is running
a covert operation

1673
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:17,541
with a spy under my roof!

1674
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,458
No.

1675
01:40:25,958 --> 01:40:27,666
No, your brother's a war hero.

1676
01:40:29,125 --> 01:40:30,333
And I envy you that.

1677
01:40:33,333 --> 01:40:35,000
Whatever went wrong, it wasn't Ivor.

1678
01:40:35,083 --> 01:40:37,541
You are a careless bastard, Montagu.

1679
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,416
You're careless with Jean,

1680
01:40:42,250 --> 01:40:45,416
you're careless with your brother,
and you're careless with your own wife.

1681
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:53,083
I don't need you to remind me of my sins.

1682
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,125
I only wonder how you
reconcile yourself with yours.

1683
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:02,208
You strike some sort of deal?

1684
01:41:03,708 --> 01:41:04,708
Spying on me.

1685
01:41:06,291 --> 01:41:08,416
My hide in exchange for...

1686
01:41:10,333 --> 01:41:11,333
what?

1687
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:21,708
I need to look after Jean.

1688
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:29,208
Everything depends on finding out
who sent that man and why.

1689
01:41:30,708 --> 01:41:32,958
What if it wasÂ Von Roenne?

1690
01:41:37,125 --> 01:41:39,208
More than anyone else
in German intelligence,

1691
01:41:40,875 --> 01:41:43,541
Von Roenne would need to
know if Mincemeat is true.

1692
01:41:46,333 --> 01:41:48,875
<i>So he could decide
if what he's whispering in Hitler's ear</i>

1693
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:50,666
<i>is fact or fiction.</i>

1694
01:41:53,333 --> 01:41:57,208
<i>Because Von Roenne may be
the one who is fighting the other war.</i>

1695
01:41:58,833 --> 01:42:00,041
<i>The secret war.</i>

1696
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:04,541
The war dedicated
to seeing Hitler destroyed.

1697
01:42:08,875 --> 01:42:10,166
Either that's true,

1698
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,333
or it's a fiction that we want to be true.

1699
01:42:15,916 --> 01:42:16,916
What's fact

1700
01:42:17,583 --> 01:42:21,000
is that you know I suspected my brother
of spying and refused to turn him in.

1701
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,916
So, you know enough
to see me ruined and my brother hanged.

1702
01:42:30,541 --> 01:42:32,500
So the next move is yours, Charles.

1703
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:35,541
What's it to be?

1704
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,083
What we know for certain...

1705
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:09,166
is that within our borders,
our eyes and ears missed nothing.

1706
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:12,333
German spies, Nazi sympathizers,

1707
01:43:12,416 --> 01:43:14,375
we know where they are.
We know who they are.

1708
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:17,500
Which means that whoever this man is,

1709
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:21,250
it's not something
we've encountered before.

1710
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:24,625
That's your excuse

1711
01:43:25,125 --> 01:43:27,666
for using a photograph
of one of our own operatives?

1712
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:29,070
The photograph was my error, sir.

1713
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:31,645
I was the one who insisted on
choosing someone within our ranks.

1714
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:33,541
The woman is beside the point.

1715
01:43:35,083 --> 01:43:38,666
I just wish I could find even a sliver
of satisfaction in having predicted this

1716
01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:40,666
fucking disaster months ago.

1717
01:43:42,958 --> 01:43:44,833
I'm still receiving intelligence.

1718
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:49,291
- The Germans are preparing for Greece.
- It could be a ruse.

1719
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:51,695
It's obviously a ruse,
given the operation's been revealed.

1720
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:53,791
Although, not necessarily, sir.

1721
01:43:55,708 --> 01:43:57,458
Montagu and I
have been racking our brains,

1722
01:43:58,333 --> 01:43:59,333
trying to

1723
01:43:59,833 --> 01:44:02,875
decode the message
behind this contact with us.

1724
01:44:03,541 --> 01:44:05,166
Why did this man reveal himself?

1725
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,041
If he's an agent for the Adwehr,

1726
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:09,875
why would he deliberately signal
that he'd discovered our deception?

1727
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:10,958
It doesn't add up,

1728
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:14,226
which is why the troop movements
to Greece may not be a ruse after all.

1729
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:17,416
Why would the Nazis continue to act
on information they know to be false?

1730
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:19,380
Because Von Roenne is
telling them to act on it.

1731
01:44:19,416 --> 01:44:22,541
There's not a shred of proof
of this so-called anti-Hitler plot.

1732
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:25,000
We don't know that it isn't true, either.

1733
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:28,791
- Christ.
- Admiral, this man came out of nowhere.

1734
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:31,458
Perhaps he is the proof
of the anti-Hitler plot.

1735
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:34,166
And he contacted us
so that we would know the plot is real.

1736
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,541
And as German troops
continue to move towards Greece,

1737
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,250
we would continue to plan for Sicily.

1738
01:44:38,333 --> 01:44:41,750
So that Von Roenne can
reinforce that misinformation with Hitler,

1739
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:42,916
leaving Sicily undefended.

1740
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,875
That is our instinct.

1741
01:44:46,166 --> 01:44:47,708
That is your <i>instinct?</i>

1742
01:44:49,666 --> 01:44:51,541
The fate of the world at stake,

1743
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:55,333
the Nazi killing machine
waiting for us on Sicily's shores, and...

1744
01:44:57,041 --> 01:44:58,833
you two with your <i>instinct.</i>

1745
01:45:01,458 --> 01:45:02,750
If it were up to me,

1746
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:06,916
I would postpone Sicily
and have you drawn and quartered.

1747
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:12,500
No doubt the prime minister
has been informed?

1748
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:15,416
What does he want to do?

1749
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:17,625
The prime minister

1750
01:45:19,208 --> 01:45:22,333
does <i>not </i>want to postpone Sicily.

1751
01:45:24,916 --> 01:45:27,541
I pray we can all live
with the consequences.

1752
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:34,750
Jean?

1753
01:45:43,166 --> 01:45:44,166
Jean?

1754
01:45:55,625 --> 01:45:56,791
He's coming home.

1755
01:45:58,708 --> 01:46:00,250
Robbie's coming home.

1756
01:46:07,666 --> 01:46:10,166
Thank you, my son.

1757
01:46:18,625 --> 01:46:20,583
And this is a posting, where?

1758
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:24,333
- They haven't told me yet.
- They?

1759
01:46:24,416 --> 01:46:25,500
Special Operations.

1760
01:46:25,583 --> 01:46:27,500
I was accepted today.

1761
01:46:28,541 --> 01:46:31,375
I suspect because Masterman
put in a good word for me.

1762
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:37,541
Hopefully, I'll find my way overseas
as a courier or a radio operator.

1763
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:38,625
I see.

1764
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:44,958
I can never forgive myself
for placing our operation in peril.

1765
01:46:45,041 --> 01:46:47,000
I won't hear it.
What happened is not your fault.

1766
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:50,791
Regardless, it'll take
the grace of God and nerves of steel

1767
01:46:50,875 --> 01:46:52,666
to land Mincemeat safely now.

1768
01:46:52,750 --> 01:46:55,750
The kind of fortitude
you have demonstrated every single day.

1769
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:58,958
I've played my part
in the Bill and Pam story, Ewen.

1770
01:46:59,541 --> 01:47:01,541
It's time for me to go where I'm needed.

1771
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:02,958
You're needed here...

1772
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:05,249
with us.

1773
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:06,750
I have to go.

1774
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:22,458
You will have your own story, then.

1775
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:25,500
You will fight your own war.

1776
01:47:27,041 --> 01:47:28,541
You will serve bravely.

1777
01:47:31,208 --> 01:47:32,791
Our country will be lucky to have you.

1778
01:47:36,041 --> 01:47:37,041
And I...

1779
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:41,250
You will be reunited
with your wife and children.

1780
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,583
A better man.

1781
01:47:50,125 --> 01:47:51,708
A man you brought back to life.

1782
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,083
I will miss you

1783
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,250
so terribly.

1784
01:48:14,958 --> 01:48:17,291
The invasion fleet
is now assembled.

1785
01:48:19,041 --> 01:48:20,875
The Seraph will be the lead vessel

1786
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:23,791
in the first wave
of the U.S. assault on Licata beach.

1787
01:48:24,958 --> 01:48:27,166
Our job will be
to set the sonar homing buoy

1788
01:48:28,083 --> 01:48:29,833
to guide the others to shore.

1789
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:32,708
A great many others,
we hear, on many beaches.

1790
01:48:33,375 --> 01:48:35,791
The largest amphibious
assault the war has seen.

1791
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:40,548
Do you believe
we have Fritz where we need him?

1792
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:45,125
It seems the enemy
has fallen for the deception.

1793
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:50,291
We expect resistance to be
limited to Italian coastal divisions.

1794
01:48:51,833 --> 01:48:53,750
Then our fighting men thank you.

1795
01:49:02,166 --> 01:49:03,625
I will see you on the other side.

1796
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:18,166
I may vomit.

1797
01:49:19,250 --> 01:49:20,708
I may vomit with you.

1798
01:49:23,916 --> 01:49:26,208
Every, uh, piece of intelligence

1799
01:49:26,291 --> 01:49:29,041
says that the Nazis
are waiting for us in Greece.

1800
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:33,291
And every piece of intelligence
may be the greatest deception

1801
01:49:33,375 --> 01:49:35,625
the Nazis have ever played against us.

1802
01:49:41,416 --> 01:49:44,375
Why do you think
Churchill still believes this can work?

1803
01:49:47,541 --> 01:49:48,833
Because he has to.

1804
01:49:54,666 --> 01:49:55,750
Jean has gone.

1805
01:49:58,125 --> 01:49:59,125
Yes.

1806
01:49:59,458 --> 01:50:00,458
I heard.

1807
01:50:11,541 --> 01:50:13,375
You've had another letter from Iris.

1808
01:50:15,458 --> 01:50:16,666
This one's for you.

1809
01:50:59,125 --> 01:51:04,416
<i>It is only fitting that the two wars
finally converge in darkness.</i>

1810
01:51:11,375 --> 01:51:13,375
<i>The target is no longer hidden.</i>

1811
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:16,750
<i>The points are set.</i>

1812
01:51:18,916 --> 01:51:20,666
<i>And the forces gather.</i>

1813
01:51:28,875 --> 01:51:29,875
<i>Brave men.</i>

1814
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:33,708
<i>Their lives hanging in the balance.</i>

1815
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:37,083
<i>Their fate unknowable.</i>

1816
01:51:38,541 --> 01:51:40,875
<i>Their part in history unwritten.</i>

1817
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:43,916
Action stations, action stations!

1818
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Move yourself!

1819
01:51:45,083 --> 01:51:46,583
Move, move, move!

1820
01:51:49,625 --> 01:51:53,958
<i>But who in these last hours
will bear witness to the hidden war...</i>

1821
01:51:56,583 --> 01:51:58,750
...<i>unseen by history,</i>

1822
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,541
<i>locked away in a buried file?</i>

1823
01:52:03,833 --> 01:52:07,333
<i>Its tragedies and triumphs unspoken.</i>

1824
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:10,500
<i>Its heroes unsung.</i>

1825
01:52:11,041 --> 01:52:13,208
In God's name, Fleming,
what are you writing?

1826
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:15,541
Spy story.

1827
01:52:21,541 --> 01:52:23,083
<i>It is in this moment...</i>

1828
01:52:25,041 --> 01:52:27,916
<i>this suspended moment...</i>

1829
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:34,833
<i>that my story waits for an ending.</i>

1830
01:52:40,416 --> 01:52:42,416
<i>As if fate herself...</i>

1831
01:52:44,333 --> 01:52:46,000
<i>were a blank page.</i>

1832
01:53:24,416 --> 01:53:27,125
Medic!

1833
01:53:46,625 --> 01:53:49,208
<i>An ending redeemed in righteousness.</i>

1834
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:59,666
<i>An ending graced with mercy.</i>

1835
01:54:33,958 --> 01:54:35,375
"Allied forces

1836
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:37,791
have landed."

1837
01:54:41,166 --> 01:54:42,416
"Limited casualties."

1838
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:44,750
"Enemy retreating."

1839
01:54:47,708 --> 01:54:49,666
"Troops met with minimal resistance."

1840
01:55:02,958 --> 01:55:04,083
"Beaches held."

1841
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:20,000
Coming through!

1842
01:55:20,958 --> 01:55:22,041
Out of the way!

1843
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:41,333
Here's another one,
from Churchill.

1844
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:48,166
"Mincemeat swallowed."

1845
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,041
"Rod, line, and sinker."

1846
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:20,083
<i>An ending...</i>

1847
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:23,666
<i>filled with light.</i>

1848
01:56:41,083 --> 01:56:42,625
We saved some lives today.

1849
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:47,541
Some lives, not all.

1850
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:49,833
Can never be all.

1851
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:56,916
We don't seem to have saved ourselves.

1852
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:00,916
But those that did make it...

1853
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,083
- Glory will be theirs.
- As it should be.

1854
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:11,833
We fooled the Fuhrer, murderous bastard.
There's some glory in that.

1855
01:57:15,041 --> 01:57:16,625
My brother has come home.

1856
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:20,000
We'll bury him tomorrow.

1857
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:25,583
It was the deal I'd struck with Godfrey

1858
01:57:26,833 --> 01:57:28,750
in exchange for spying on you.

1859
01:57:33,291 --> 01:57:34,625
Then I'd like to be there.

1860
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,416
I need to go home
and finish a letter to my wife.

1861
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:54,666
But first, I need a drink.

1862
01:57:56,708 --> 01:57:57,916
Let me buy you a drink.

1863
01:58:00,250 --> 01:58:01,458
Eight in the morning.

1864
01:58:02,458 --> 01:58:04,375
Surely someone will take us in.

1865
01:58:05,305 --> 01:59:05,614
