<i>I love drumming.</i>

3
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>When my eyes are closed</i>
<i>and I'm playing the beat,</i>

4
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>it's the same if there's,</i>
<i>you know, 40,000 people</i>

5
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,560
<i>or if there's 40 people or four.</i>

6
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,360
<i>It's really just moving the air</i>
<i>with these vibrations</i>

7
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,120
<i>and getting people to feel</i>
<i>the power of the drum.</i>

8
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,960
<i>It's punctuating life with rhythm.</i>

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
<i>When I play drums at the drum circle</i>

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,320
<i>or big concerts, you feel like</i>
<i>you're connecting with people.</i>

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,280
<i>Once you start playing,</i>

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,120
<i>nothing else really matters,</i>
<i>you're in the moment.</i>

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,760
<i>It's a great instrument to play.</i>

14
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,640
When I was young, I saw a show
about Benny Goodman,

15
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,760
and they had the real
Gene Krupa in the movie.

16
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,040
And every time they went to Gene,
he was slamming.

17
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
And they go to the audience,

18
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,480
they were snapping,
and I just thought that it seems like

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,200
the coolest thing in the world to
play and drive a song and turn people on.

20
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
<i>I believe it was a Monday.</i>

21
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,240
<i>We used to have bath nights</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

22
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
Me dad was there ironing.
Me dad loved to iron.

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,120
Which was great, my mum loved it.

24
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,480
I think that's why she married him,
you know.

25
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,720
Anyway, set up near the ironing board.

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,560
And we had a little, like,
black and white TV set.

27
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,640
So the TV show was on.

28
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
Off they go, and I've gone…

29
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
"Whoa, who's that, Dad?"

30
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,080
"That's, er, Dave Brubeck Quartet, son."

31
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
"No, no. Who's that on the drum set?"

32
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,960
"Oh, that's Joe Morello, son."

33
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,200
"Wow! He's good, isn't he?"

34
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,600
I said, "I just want to be like him."

35
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,680
"You'll never be as good as Joe Morello,"
goes my dad's report.

36
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,400
And I'm like, "That's me done."

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,320
The video that changed my life
was Mötley Crüe's "Wild Side",

38
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,280
{\an8}where I saw Tommy Lee
rolling around in a drum cage

39
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,800
{\an8}and I thought, "Oh, my God,
that's the job for me."

40
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm done, I need to play drums.

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,360
I was, like, super shy, like the shyest
girl that you could ever have met, huh,

42
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,240
and I just…
I went to this drum club and…

43
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,640
You know, in <i>The Matrix,</i>
when Neo suddenly sees all the code?

44
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
It felt like that.

45
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,520
Like, I couldn't do it yet,
but I understood it.

46
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,280
I understood the principles of it.

47
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,200
It was the sort of drum
break on "Wipeout" by The Surfaris,

48
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
which is one of the first things
I learned, I think.

49
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,920
And I… "Oh, I can do that,
you know, is it…"

50
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,000
And that's great.

51
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,920
You know, when you suddenly think,
"Oh, I can do that."

52
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,760
As an 11-year-old,
I was into Sandy Nelson.

53
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,360
{\an8}The records focused on the sound of the
drums and the sound of what he was doing.

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,840
{\an8}I remember dragging my mother,
"Mom, listen…

55
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,360
what he's doing there, see, Mom, see.
Hear that 'shh' sound?"

56
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,600
"That's because he's playing
the drums so fast that it sounds like…"

57
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
"Hey, Mom. No, Mom. No, listen, listen."

58
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
<i>And here, you know,</i>
<i>I sort of have a vague memory</i>

59
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,160
<i>of harassing my poor old mom</i>
<i>to listen to Sandy Nelson.</i>

60
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,440
<i> They just looked so cool.</i>

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,680
You know, when you're young
and impressionable,

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,400
{\an8}everything about it was mysterious
and magical and dangerous.

63
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,840
You gotta remember, this time,
rarely were people on television.

64
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,800
And you looked at the records,
the actual albums, and you opened them up,

65
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,280
so it really left a lot
to your imagination.

66
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
I had this incredible drum set.

67
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,960
I mean, it was growing exponentially.

68
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,960
Every day
there'd be something else in it.

69
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
I went out in the kitchen
and I picked up a pair of knives

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,440
and I beat the living
daylights out my mum's cooker.

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,320
There's all these pieces of enamel
flying off my mum's cooker.

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,760
Dad comes in…

73
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
"What's going on in here?

74
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,960
What's this confounded racket
you're making?"

75
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm beating it… I ain't stopping.

76
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm Joe, I'm that dark sunglass guy.

77
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm giving it the big one
on the top of the cooker.

78
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,960
{\an8}I played on pans and pots
and random drums.

79
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,240
{\an8}And my dad had goalie pads,
he was a hockey player.

80
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,040
I did that for, like, a year,

81
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,680
until finally, they were like, "Okay,
I think she's serious,

82
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
we'll buy her a drum set."

83
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:37,240
When my first toy drum kit arrived, I had
to be the happiest kid in the universe.

84
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,560
{\an8}And I'll never forget that little kit
because it was one of those drum kits

85
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,000
{\an8}that you get from Sears
and Roebucks, you know?

86
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,120
{\an8}And it was… I call it a Beatles kit

87
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,280
because it had a picture
of the Beatles on the front,

88
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,160
you know, and it was made of
cardboard and paper.

89
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,160
{\an8}And it took about a day
for me to tear that up.

90
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,720
{\an8}Ladies and gentlemen, the Beatles!

The TV is on.

93
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,880
{\an8}I'm in the other room
and I'm hearing Cynthia say,

For people of my generation,
the Beatles on <i>Ed Sullivan</i> in the States

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,240
was a pivotal point,

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,040
And he could dance while he played,
which was great.

109
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
I loved him.

110
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,640
Looking back at that
early footage again, there's this fire,

111
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,080
this intensity to the way Ringo played
and would splash the cymbals.

112
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,840
And he was, you know, up high
and on the edge of his seat.

113
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,960
He had a punk energy, the fire with which
he's playing and driving that band.

114
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,840
And when you remember that
they had a hard time hearing each other,

115
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,760
but he was laying down the beat
and driving that band.

116
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
To me, there's nobody like him.

117
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,200
His main influence
was American, solidly American.

118
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
I mean, from early on…

119
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,720
<i>They were in Liverpool,</i>
<i>so they had the advantage</i>

120
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,000
<i>of getting the newest records</i>
<i>coming from the sailors.</i>

121
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,680
{\an8}They were able to hear
the American rock stuff

122
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,880
{\an8}that was happening at the time,
and they were hugely influenced by that.

123
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,080
The Mersey Sound.
<i>Yes, Liverpool's selling pop music.</i>

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,920
{\an8}<i>Liverpool kids are proud of the fact</i>
<i>that their city is providing</i>

125
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,000
{\an8}<i>the world with beat music</i>
<i>and an offbeat cult of fashion.</i>

126
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,360
<i>Tune in for a bit.</i>

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,320
Everyone wanted the same thing.

128
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,520
They wanted to be an R&amp;B band
because that was cool,

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,400
even though we were playing
all sorts of other nonsense,

130
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
but the ambition was R&amp;B.

131
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,880
And everyone was listening to,
you know, the old blues records,

132
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,160
Muddy Waters, Lightnin' Hopkins,
Howlin' Wolf and so on.

133
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
We listened to the music.

134
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,880
We made it our own.

135
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,720
We messed around with it and we sent it
back to America and America loved it.

136
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,840
And they loved it because it was being
made by funny guys with funny haircuts.

137
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
<i>So it didn't matter whether we were</i>
<i>playing it right or playing it wrong,</i>

138
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
<i>they loved it.</i>

139
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,160
Here's these young guys from
England playing it 'cause they dig it.

140
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Like Charlie Watts would say,

141
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,160
"The Stones, we just wanted to be
a good, you know, R&amp;B cover band."

142
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,400
That's what they were
for a while, you know,

143
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
until they started writing
their own songs.

144
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,920
And that's kind of naturally
the way it goes.

145
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,920
They packaged it in a way
that us Americans just ate it up.

146
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,000
Charlie.

147
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,760
{\an8}It's about the groove, dude,
Don't… You know, all that other shit?

148
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,320
{\an8}Doesn't matter.
Just hit that magic sweet spot,

149
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,040
{\an8}the good foot, the whatever it is.
Of course, they got excellent lyrics

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,520
and wonderful musicianship on the guitar.

151
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,000
Great, you know,
all kinds of other qualities.

152
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,600
But it's that ramshackle groove
that's unique that many look for,

153
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,680
but few can achieve that
sophisticated dishevelment.

154
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,960
<i>And that's why the Stones are the Stones.</i>

155
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah, Charlie Watts is an English drummer
who plays like no other English drummer.

156
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,480
He… He just doesn't.

157
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,160
He didn't… Never smiled.

158
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,680
You got a couple of them… out of him,

159
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,160
you know, in the early days.

160
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,800
He was a jazz drummer.
He was a big band player,

161
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
playing in a pop band.

162
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
He… That was his thing.

163
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,160
But he… And he just had this thing

164
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,520
where… Ringo was this…

165
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,880
And Charlie…

166
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,840
It's like he'd…

167
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,760
He'd leave a beat out.

168
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
On his hi-hat.

169
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,200
And I thought, "God,
that's fucking brilliant."

170
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,680
<i>That's what I'm gonna do.</i>
<i>I wanna be him.</i>

171
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,040
If you listen to the beginning
of "Honky Tonk Woman"

172
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,240
by the Rolling Stones,
it starts out at a certain tempo.

173
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,200
♪ <i>She tried to take me</i>
<i>upstairs for a ride ♪</i>

174
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,920
This is the great Charlie Watts,
one of the best all-time drummers ever.

175
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,680
And by the end, he's probably like…

176
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,360
If it starts at 103,
he's probably at 109 or something.

177
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,960
♪ <i>It's a honkey tonk woman ♪</i>

178
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,640
<i>But you don't sit there and go,</i>

179
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,520
<i>"Oh, God,</i>
<i>that song is really speeding up."</i>

180
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,960
<i>It's just naturally…</i>
<i>That's how they play.</i>

181
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,800
Whoo!

182
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
"Merry Christmas, Mommy plus Dad."

183
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,720
Well, usually
drumsticks come in pairs.

184
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,560
So that's probably what the other part is.

185
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
Yeah.

186
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,680
{\an8}Eventually, after ruining enough
cooking ware, my parents acquiesced

187
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,240
{\an8}and got me an actual drum set
when I was four years old.

188
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,160
- Yes!
- No!

189
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
Yeah!

190
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,400
- No!
- Yeah!

191
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,520
And here's the drumstick. Yeah!

192
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
<i>I remember getting</i>
<i>a drum kit at the age of six.</i>

193
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,040
I lived in a tiny little house
in a village.

194
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,200
So making noise wasn't a very
popular thing to do down my road.

195
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,200
Okay, open them.

196
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,200
My favourite!

197
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, my God, this is a drum set!

198
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,960
It's a drum set!

199
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,360
It's a drum set!

200
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,360
It's a drum set!

201
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,600
Yay!

202
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,720
You okay?

203
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,440
Mmm-hmm.

204
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,960
For Christmas, I got an acoustic kit,
and I remember, like,

205
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,480
falling against the wall
because I was so overwhelmed

206
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,720
and excited, and just…
Like, this was it.

207
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,840
I mean, it was like giving me
a lifetime supply of gold

208
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,840
or… I don't know, it was just like,

209
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,280
this is the most incredible
moment of my life.

210
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,120
It was a sign,
that my parents were going,

211
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,280
"We believe you can do this, too."

212
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,320
But what that meant was
I could go and do live gigs.

213
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,040
That was the big thing
about having my own drum kit.

214
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
I was like, "I can actually…"

215
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
"I could be a professional now."

216
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,080
So my father would sit down
and show me a beat.

217
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,560
I'd play it and then he would
pick up the bass and we'd jam.

218
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,440
That's what playing the drums
has always been for me,

219
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,400
is an opportunity
to play with other musicians.

220
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,560
And, uh, to listen to what they're doing.

221
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,400
Yeah!

222
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,440
Yeah!

223
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,440
<i>I was introduced to drums,</i>

224
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,600
<i>so I started playing the drums</i>
<i>when I was 13.</i>

225
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,000
I'd seen Keith Moon on <i>Top of the Pops.</i>

226

<i>-♪ Talkin' 'bout my generation ♪</i>

227
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
All of a sudden,
this band came and they were louder

228
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,720
than anything you'd ever heard,
and they were violent,

229
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,240
and had great songs and charisma.

230
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,400
<i>-♪ Why don't you all fade away ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Talkin' 'bout my generation ♪</i>

231
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,160
The Who were phenomenal.

232
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,760
And Keith Moon, a drummer
like nobody had ever seen.

233
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,920
From this sort of seeming chaos, beautiful to watch, huh,

234
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,920
came this great…
came these great drum parts.

235
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,400
And I got it all wrong.

236
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,400
I thought, he's the best looking
in the group.

237
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,960
He's right at the front.

238
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
It's all about him.

239
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
All the cameras were shots of him.

240
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,600
I want to be Keith Moon.
I want to play the drums.

241
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,600
{\an8}Of course, I started playing the drums,

242
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,360
{\an8}and by the time I realised
that drummers sat at the back

243
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,560
{\an8}and just kept the beat,
it was a bit too late.

244
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,280
But he was why I started wanting
to play the drums, Keith Moon.

245
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,480
There, to me, was a guy
who has a natural sense of time.

246
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,160
He's not just keeping a straight beat,
although he could do that.

247
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,200
But the way that he expressed himself
on his instrument was very unique.

248
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,960
♪ <i>Yeah, my generation ♪</i>

249
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,200
<i>I think that the really</i>
<i>great drummers have that.</i>

250
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,920
My brother was the coolest kid on campus,

251
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,680
and there was a band in the school
as well, The Black Knights.

252
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,320
So Ian, obviously, as the coolest guy
in Beirut,

253
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,680
should be the drummer in the band.
So Ian had the drums in his bedroom

254
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,600
and he was trying to figure them out.

255
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,440
But he couldn't really,
and when he would leave,

256
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,680
I would sneak into his room
on pain of death.

257
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,680
I would sneak into his room
and get on there

258
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,960
and try and do what he was doing,
and actually…

259
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,440
But I can do it.

260
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,080
This can't be right.

261
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,920
I must be doing it wrong.

262
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,000
I picked up my dad's sticks
and I got my sister in,

263
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,880
and I told her to bring a spoon in,
a tablespoon.

264
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,440
So she brought the spoon in.

265
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,720
So I said, "Do this, just hit it. One…"

266
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,640
"And count to yourself,
'one, two, three, four.'"

267
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,520
And so I played against that.
And that was the thrill of my lifetime.

268
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
That's when I knew…

269
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,480
what syncopation was all about,
what it was like to groove.

270
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,800
I had a neighbour named Kent Kleeder

271
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,760
who had a drum set, a really bad drum set.

272
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,800
So he said,
"Sit on this drum set, Taylor."

273
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
"And you do this. You go,

274
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
'One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.'"

275
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,360
"And on one, you put your foot,
and that's called a kick drum."

276
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,080
"So you go, 'One, two, three, four.
One, two…'"

277
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,120
And I was like, "Okay."

278
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,680
And then he goes, "On three…"

279
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,240
"This is a snare drum."

280
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,280
"You cross your hands
and you hit the snare drum on three."

281
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,560
I went…

282
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,520
And he goes, "Stop."

283
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm like, "What?" He's like,

284
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,320
"You're a fucking drummer, dude."

285
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,800
And it was, like, literally
like a lightning bolt.

286
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
And I'll remember…

287
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,240
everything about that moment

288
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,840
for the rest of my life
'cause everything changed.

289
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,240
Well, my dad was a drummer
and I didn't want to play drums

290
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
{\an8}'cause I was like,
"I want to be different and unique."

291
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
{\an8}"I don't wanna be the drummer as well."

292
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,520
{\an8}So, uh, my dad was like,
"I'll buy you a guitar

293
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,680
if you play drums
for just a year in the school band."

294
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,560
So I joined the school band.

295
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,240
I did a whole year.

296
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,880
And then, even till now,
he never bought me a guitar,

297
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,120
so it felt like a little bit
of a bribe, but it worked.

298
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,560
I am going to go pick out a drum kit
from Ross, the Drum Doctor.

299
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,600
So I'm going drum shopping today,

300
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,880
which is my favourite
kind of shopping to do.

301
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,040
I'm picking out a kit to
do a little jam with

302
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,080
some drummer idols of mine, actually.

303
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,840
These are people
that I totally look up to.

304
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,840
I can't believe I'm going to be
in the same room as them

305
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
and then also playing drums with them.

306
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,480
Um, I feel like that's such an honour,
but I'm very excited to do it.

307
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,840
Wow.

308
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,040
Whoa.

309
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

310
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,480
-How are you doing?
-I'm good.

311
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,400
This is awesome.

312
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,720
I love this. I want everything.

313
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,560
Welcome to my temple of drums.

314
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
Yeah, this is amazing.

315
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,520
-Thank you for having me.
-Yeah, it's my pleasure.

316
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,440
-Glad you could make it.
-Yeah. Thank you.

317
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,640
Feel free to tap on them
and, uh, figure out what works for you.

318
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,600
Yeah.

319
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,960
You got a lot of choices.

320
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,400
Looks like you have plenty of choices,
so it might take me a while to pick one.

321
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,640
<i>When I started</i>
<i>Drum Doctors, I had, uh…</i>

322
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,360
<i>I think I had five drum sets</i>
<i>and twelve snares.</i>

323
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,680
I had good taste back then
because that stuff is still renting today.

324
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,760
And this is, you know,
this was 1981 that I started it.

325
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,040
Do you know how many kits
you have total in here?

326
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,400
Honestly, I don't.

327
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,040
Yeah, it's never-ending.

328
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,040
I felt that because
I had been the drummer

329
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,920
and I saw what a drummer needed,

330
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,120
that I could be better
at taking care of them

331
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,280
than a roadie who was just basically
a guy who is moving stuff,

332
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,840
who really didn't understand
how to tune a drum or

333
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,520
really how to set up a drum or,

334
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,680
you know, all the little intricacies.

335
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>I like big sounding drums.</i>

336
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,400
- <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Like the deep tones.</i>

337
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,360
I feel like I look like
I'm a delicate, fragile person,

338
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,640
but when I get behind the kit
I want it to sound big.

339
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,560
-Yeah, with the right combinations…
-Yeah.

340
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,960
…and the tunings and stuff we could make
you sound as big as you want,

341
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
without giving away
too many of my secrets.

342
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,280
Yeah.

349
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,640
I'm having the best time of my life.

<i>Those moments are so precious in life.</i>

353
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
And it's a privilege

354
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,920

<i>He's got great time, great feel.</i>

357
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,320
And he gets it, you know?

358
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,800
And they get it,
as far as being a live band.

359
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,840
It's a thing.

360
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,560
When I go see players, I want to see guys

361
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,160
with intent,

362
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,480
that are doing it with conviction

363
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,960
and doing it because…
'Cause you fucking mean it.

364
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,640
If not, go flip hamburgers.

365
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,920
All my favourite drummers
are American

366
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,880
who have learnt from English drummers,

367
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,200
who have probably learnt
from American drummers.

368
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,080
But it all comes back
to England, doesn't it?

369
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,920
Obviously, 'cause we started it.

370
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,640
My dad, when I first started playing,
here's a tip.

371
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,920
He said to me, "Son, this is your feet.

372
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
So this is your left foot on the hi-hat.

373
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,080
So that left foot will go
backwards and forwards and rock.

374
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,680
If you look at a lot of the old
jazz drummers from the '60s, '50s,

375
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,120
that's how they play.

376
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,600
And that left foot is their timekeeper."

377
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,480
Right?

378
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,280
And that's all it's doing,
backwards and forwards.

379
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,080
My old man says, "Son…

380
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,480
I want you to sit there and do the same
on the right foot, but the other way."

381
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
So…

382
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,120
So, huh…

383
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,400
What was the question?

384
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,360
There's a theme here,
and there's a theme for a reason

385
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,600
as to why these drummers liked
jazz drummers and liked jazz.

386
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,600
Well, at the beginning,
it was all about jazz drummers

387
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,880
'cause of the conversation. Elvin Jones.

388
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
Art Blakey.

389
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,960
Buddy "The God" Rich,
because it doesn't get better.

390
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,960
<i>There's a big difference</i>

391
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,920
<i>between playing rock and playing jazz.</i>

392
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,120
<i>You're able to make the music move</i>
<i>and change and grow.</i>

393
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,360
{\an8}You're able to interject
your ideas and your opinions.

394
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,040
{\an8}You're able to play around the form,

395
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,720
you're able to play
across the bar line,

396
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
able to change directions real quick.

397
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,800
Playing in most rock situations
or in pop rock situations,

398
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,240
um, the goal is to play a groove.

399
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,760
There's a beauty in that,
to being able to lay down something

400
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,240
that just feels great, you know,
and allows the music to float.

401
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,200
♪ <i>I want to get away ♪</i>

402
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,840
♪ <i>I want to fly away</i>
<i>Yeah ♪</i>

403
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,760
And it makes people want to dance.

404
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
You know, you play a nice…

405
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,280
It's going to make somebody
feel a certain way.

406
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,360
You know, when
somebody starts tapping their foot,

407
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,960
you know you're in there.

408
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
The difference between playing that
and playing jazz…

409
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,320
You know, you want that to feel good.

410
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,800
Until rock 'n' roll came along

411
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,080
in the '50s, very, very few
pieces of popular music

412
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
had a straight eight…

413
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
It was all…

414
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,680
So everything I heard had that in it.

415
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,120
And when I started to play,

416
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,880
even if the basis of the song
was ,

417
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,160
in my head I'd still be feeling,
where does the swing come in it?

418
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,640
And even if I wasn't playing
the note, I'd be thinking it.

419
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,640
The sort of grace note.

420
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Grace note is a tiny little
touch on the drum,

421
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,800
which influences the next note.

422
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,360
And without that, the feel
you're trying to achieve

423
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,760
is impossible because all you
end up hearing is "do, da, do, da."

424
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,760
But you get…
That little… changes everything.

425
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,120
And sometimes you don't have to play them,
but you got to think them.

426
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,840
One of the remarkable things
about your playing

427
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,480
is the way you manage
to get a kind of dialogue

428
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,960
going between your feet and your hands.

429
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,680
Not only are your feet each playing
different rhythms,

430
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
but so are your hands.

431
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,640
And that, of course, doesn't account for
cymbals, it's like a one-man orchestra.

432
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,160
{\an8}Yeah, you can get good tings on a cymbal.

433
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,600
{\an8}Can you give us an example
of this kind of instrumental conversation?

434
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,280
The great Ginger Baker,
who is a jazz drummer

435
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,040
trapped in a rock man's body.

436
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,600
When I saw Ginger Baker
with his double bass drums

437
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,000
and right in the middle
and playing, I think, "N.S.U."

438
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,880
and just thinking, "Now
that is what I'd like to be."

439
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,880
<i>He wasn't at the back.</i>

440
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,920
<i>He was actually part of the band</i>

441
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,800
<i>and actually interacting</i>
<i>with Jack or Eric, or whatever.</i>

442
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,960
It was a very different dynamic to Ringo
being 15 feet behind on a riser.

443
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,480
<i>He was an amazing</i>
<i>Jazz bebop fusion-type drummer.</i>

444
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,280
<i>When Cream came along,</i>
<i>he just changed it all round.</i>

445
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,360
It's like they said, "Okay,
that's enough of that.

446
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm going to do this now."

447
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
And when you hear Ginger
playing with Cream…

448
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,400
…all of a sudden,
it's not that jazzy thing any more.

449
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,280
He's made a new statement
in rock 'n' roll.

450
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,560
Ginger Baker on drums!

451
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,680
<i>I don't care about Ringo.</i>

452
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,120
I don't care about Charlie.

453
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,280
I'm sorry.

454
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,720
It's all about John Bonham.

455
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,880
Led Zeppelin.

456
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,840
Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin, that's it.

457
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,480
What is that?

458
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,040
Check this shit out, motherfucker!

459
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,280
Every drummer in America in 1975

460
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,360
wanted to sound like John Bonham,
because he was the best.

461
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,520
<i>He got the best drum sound.</i>

462
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,640
His drums were tuned the best.

463
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,440
<i>He was in the biggest band,</i>
<i>he was the best.</i>

464
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,960
<i>You got to remember,</i>
<i>Robert Plant and Bonham were, like,</i>

465
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,920
<i>19 or 20 when they joined the band.</i>
<i>Something like that.</i>

466
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,480
Like, that's young, man.

467
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
And here's a guy who comes out

468
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,600
a fully realised musician,
like the first Zeppelin album,

469
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,800
he's doing his doubles.

470
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,840
The first song, "Good Times, Bad Times."

471
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,240
He's doing his John Bonham thing
from the very get-go.

472
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,880
<i>I think Freddie saw them</i>
<i>at the Marquee before I did,</i>

473
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,600
<i>and then he said, "Well, come on, you've</i>
<i>got to see this band, they're great."</i>

474
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,400
We went to the Lyceum in the Strand.

475
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,640
They sort of shuffled on,

476
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,680
and Bonzo just sort of did
a little warm-up.

477
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,320
And we both sort of… Wow!

478
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,880
You know, most drummers
didn't sound like that.

479
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Tremendous power and speed.

480
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,680
And he was technically brilliant.

481
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,880
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what Led Zeppelin was.</i>

482
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,000
We were kind of tripping backstage
and I tapped on the bass drum,

483
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,160
Bonham's bass drum,
and it just went "boing!"

484
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,480
{\an8}Like, what?
Like, there was no…

485
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,400
{\an8}Like, my bass drum was, you know,
Hollywood recording ready

486
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,760
with the blanket in it
and the front head off,

487
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,360
and his was just exactly the opposite.

488
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,120
Both heads on, nothing inside.

489
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,160
You could tell, it just went "boing!"

490
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,000
And I said, "Maybe it's kind of like
a Salvation Army kind of thing."

491
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,200
You know, I was thinking, like, maybe some
big marching bass drum kind of sound.

492
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,200
That night, to watch them was incredible.

493
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,720
<i> I had a rough childhood,</i>

494
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,400
<i>and I think that as a girl,</i>
<i>like, you're supposed</i>

495
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,320
<i>to keep your feelings in or whatever.</i>

496
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,320
{\an8}But for me, I got behind the drum set

497
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,000
{\an8}and I beat the shit out of it,
and it was my release.

498
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,760
I wanted to take
the beater of the kick drum

499
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:08,160
and just smash it through and just
crack my snare as hard as I could.

500
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,760
And that's what I
could learn along to Bonham's playing.

501
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,520
<i>Everything you need to know as a drummer,</i>

502
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,920
<i>just listen to Led Zeppelin</i>
<i>and you'll learn it.</i>

503
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,400
When you're that age,
fifth grade,

504
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,400
you need something to kind of
hang your hat on.

505
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,760
If you're not a great athlete
or you're not, like…

506
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,680
the best-looking kid
in the world or whatever,

507
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,880
you need something.

508
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,960
And once I found drums,
it kind of became my coat of Armour.

509
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,800
We started playing these clubs in Detroit,

510
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,040
and we would play three sets a night,
six nights a week,

511
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
and it was like,

512
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,080
{\an8}"This is it, I've made it.
This is the greatest thing ever."

513
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,160
I'm walking around in my bare feet
in these, you know,

514
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,520
beer-soaked clubs in Detroit
and playing music, and girls,

515
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,960
and everything that went with that,

516
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,880
and it was like,
"Wow, this is really something."

517
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,000
"I'm a professional musician,
making $165 a week."

518
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,240
But I was doing what I wanted to do,
what I loved.

519
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,440
I got paid 20 quid
to be in the house band

520
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,680
when I was like 14, and I was like,
"I'm a professional!"

521
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,280
<i>That was the overriding feeling.</i>

522
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,640
<i>It was like, "I'm doing it.</i>
<i>And I'm…" It just felt right.</i>

523
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
I was… I was…

524
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,760
I was on my path and I was heading
exactly where I wanted to go.

525
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,280
Telling your parents
you want to drop out of college

526
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,720
{\an8}to be in a rock band
and tour with a bunch of boys,

527
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,880
{\an8}my parents were a little bit
iffy about that.

528
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,720
<i>It was funny. They gave me a year.</i>

529
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,680
<i>They said, "We'll give you a year</i>
<i>to do that, and then, you know,</i>

530
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,040
<i>go back to school</i>
<i>and go back to your plan."</i>

531
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,800
The first tour we did, our parents closing
that van door. It was a 15-passenger van,

532
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,400
they closed it for us and they're all
in their driveway waving at us.

533
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
And I remember we all looked around,
we were like, "Are we really doing this?"

534
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,120
We were so excited, no parents with us,
you know what I mean?

535
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,160
It was just a bunch of 18-year-olds
in a van travelling around the US.

536
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,720
<i>You know, I was playing music every night.</i>

537
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,280
<i>We weren't making any money.</i>

538
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,040
<i>We were sleeping on people's floors.</i>

539
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,400
<i>If we couldn't sleep on people's floors,</i>
<i>we would just sleep in the van.</i>

540
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,560
<i>You know, I think I was just so happy</i>
<i>to be doing what other people,</i>

541
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,520
<i>I think, had always, like,</i>
<i>dreamed of doing.</i>

542
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,160
The dream was, you know,
to achieve success in America.

543
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,720
So you go there, all very wide-eyed

544
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,400
and everything's very big
and the distances are huge.

545
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,320
The touring really was hard work.

546
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,320
I mean, there was the
lightning bolt at Kent Kleeder's house.

547
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,640
The second thing, a couple months later,
was the Queen concert.

548
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,440
My first concert ever was Queen,

549
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,760
and Roger Taylor was like
a garage punk rock drummer

550
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,920
in this glorious orchestral band.

551
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,720
And his parts were orchestral,
but his attitude was just…

552
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,320
That was my first experience
of seeing a band, and I still feel it,

553
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,880
smell it, taste it, hear it.

554
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,640
<i> And Roger Taylor,</i>

555
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,160
<i>he played the whole drum set, like,</i>
<i>it was kind of like an orchestra.</i>

556
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,440
<i>He played such perfect parts for songs,</i>

557
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,960
<i>but yet would let you know</i>
<i>he's there, too.</i>

558
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,560
It wasn't just timekeeping.

559
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:30,240
Every once in a while, some flashy,
perfectly placed fill would happen.

560
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,240
That to me was like, that's how you…

561
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,600
That's an arena band,
that's what you want to be.

562
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,760
In the first half, we saw how rock stars
have become more and more distant

563
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,920
from their audiences. Some are tax exiles
and live abroad in California or Europe.

564
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,640
Others only appear on stage
in vast stadiums where tickets cost plenty

565
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,240
and they appear as small dots
on the horizon.

566
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,800
All the people in punk bands,
we didn't really have a choice.

567
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,840
We weren't ever going to be
in a prog rock band.

568
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
We weren't ever going to be able to play

569
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,880
sophisticated time signatures
and have flute solos,

570
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,120
that just wasn't what we wanted.

571
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,320
♪ <i>I got a feeling inside of me ♪</i>

572
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,840
♪ <i>It's kind of strange</i>
<i>Like a stormy sea ♪</i>

573
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,960
♪ <i>I don't know why… ♪</i>

574
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,640
High energy, fast tunes,

575
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,200
that's where I was comfortable.
That's what felt good.

576
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,320
It was something with adrenaline,
you know, rush.

577
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,000
And that was exactly
what the rest of the band wanted.

578
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,040
♪ <i>I got a new rose, I got her good ♪</i>

579
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,800
♪ <i>I guess I knew that I always would ♪</i>

580
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,400
If they are singing,
don't bash too many drums.

581
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,040
When the singing stops,
do whatever you like

582
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,560
to bring in the next bit.

583
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,560
♪ <i>I never thought</i>
<i>This could happen to me ♪</i>

584
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,840
You watch a guitar player
play a solo, and they go,

585
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,640
"Oh, I'm tearing every note from my soul.

586
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,240
Oh, I'm in tears." And I'm gonna go…

587
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,000
The drummer's like,

588
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,840
"Yeah, get a load of this.

589
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,440
I'm here, I can do."

590
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,840
I'll never work again.

591
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,560
{\an8}If I came off stage
with half an ounce of energy,

592
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,520
{\an8}it was a poor gig.

593
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,200
{\an8}It was play as fast as you could,
I'd be gasping for breath.

594
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,360
It's just like sprinting.

595
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,640
You just sprint
and you give it everything you can.

596
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,480
The punk rock discipline,
it's real discipline.

597
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,120
It's not jamming.

598
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,160
You don't jam, you know, you play your
part and you work hard to write that part.

599
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,520
And you work hard to have
the endurance so you can play it.

600
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,240
The four of us would come off
and just collapse on the floor.

601
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,120
It was 100% we put in,
100% to everything.

606

My role on stage really was just
to anchor it.

607
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,800
And they'd all run around,
like three Eddie Cochrans,

608
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,520
making brilliant noise and stuff
and looking amazing.

609
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,640
And then if they got lost,
they'd turn to me.

{\an8}you're only as good as your drummer,
and that is really true,

616
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,640
{\an8}because if you try and imagine a group
and the drummer is falling apart,

617
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,120
then no matter what you're putting on top,
it's going to fall apart.

622
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,000
<i>I used to watch </i>Top of the Pops,
<i>and I'd watch how drummers play.</i>

623
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,640
I realised they sat like this
and they played the hi-hat.

624
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,240
You know, if you've got a brain,
it's quite easy to figure it all out.

625
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,120
Then I'd buy an album,
and I'd know they sat like that,

626
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,000
and I'd listen to it and I'd copy it.

627
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:55,240
Finding someone who not only had the chops
but the strength and the stamina to do it,

628
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,280
was just the breakthrough for us.
If we hadn't have found Topper Headon,

629
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,120
we'd have never, ever got anywhere.

630
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,280
Every now and then,
even punks on amyl nitrate got to chill.

631
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,640
{\an8}There's only… Sniffing glue
will only get you so far

632
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,440
{\an8}into the evening.
And, so they gotta chill.

633
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,600
But there's no chill punk music,
'cause it ain't punk if it's chill.

634
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,760
<i>But Don Letts, the DJ of the time,</i>

635
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,800
<i>figured out that dub reggae</i>
<i>would fit the bill perfectly.</i>

636
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,080
<i>It's hostile, it's dark.</i>

637
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,560
It's really pissed off, but chill.

638
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,480
<i>And it was The Clash,</i>
<i>credit must be given,</i>

639
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,280
<i>who first had the inkling of an idea.</i>

640
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,680
<i>"Hey, why don't us white boys</i>
<i>try to play some of that?"</i>

641
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,320
And as the things progressed
and the music started to get

642
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,120
a little more dynamic, you really heard
the drummer become more aware

643
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:02,120
of this Jamaican, African drumbeats
that he was throwing in.

644
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,840
It was organic. Nothing was…

645
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,080
Nothing was contrived or planned.

646
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,720
As I played with the group
and we started rehearsing

647
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,480
some more numbers,
a few funk influences crept in.

648
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,840
Er… " In Hammersmith Palais."
Came in as a fill.

649
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,240
A few other bits and pieces.
We went and saw Taj Mahal at the…

650
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,520
I think it was
at the Venue in Victoria.

651
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,960
And I nicked a few bits off Taj Mahal.
It just became like a melting pot.

652
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,440
Like, my philosophy of drumming
became the philosophy,

653
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,400
or was the philosophy of The Clash.

654
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,440
I'm not saying I made it, it just
became the philosophy of The Clash.

655
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,080
We'd try and play everything.

656
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,240
I had been listening
to a lot of reggae anyway,

657
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,880
and was already trying to figure out

658
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,560
that it's totally wrong, the way that
that guy… drummer is doing on the drums.

659
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,440
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

660
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,360
No, no! But it's kinda right.

661
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,280
And so figuring out
that you play the backbeat

662
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,960
and the downbeat at the same time…

663
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,160
Well, what are the other beats for?
You listen again and check it out.

664
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,960
Geez, really? Really?

665
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,520
<i>And it's hard to do on your own</i>
<i>because it doesn't work,</i>

666
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,760
<i>unless the uptick is there on the guitar.</i>

667
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,560
You know, it's very much his personality,
and then there's a great unconventionality

668
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,600
to how, where he places the beats. You can
hear the world, the global influence.

669
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,200
You can hear the areas that he grew up in

670
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,080
in the way he plays,
the way he offsets the beat,

671
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,360
the way he accents things,
the way he doesn't always have

672
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,360
to rely on playing two and four again.

673
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,600
And I think, again,
it's inspired by the melody

674
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,640
and the bass and guitar lines.

675
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,080
And he's… You can tell
he's equal with the variations

676
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,520
that the other guys in the band play.

677
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,960
And he was always just
turning the beat around,

678
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,360
and putting stuff on upbeats
and doing…

679
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,560
And constantly surprising you
throughout a pop song.

680
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,400
Throwing fireworks.

681
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,680
That's really what he was doing, you know?

682
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,520
You hear 'em

683
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,080
and you see 'em go out,
but they don't blow exactly

684
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
when you think they're gonna, you know?

685
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,880
And then they blow.
And then another one blows

686
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,600
a little later and then a third one.

687
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,760
He's very…unpredictable.

688
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,240
<i>And that's really hard</i>

689
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,720
<i>as a drummer, because people feel</i>
<i>comfortable when they can predict</i>

690
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,360
<i>what's happening with the drum part,</i>
<i>and it's repetitive.</i>

691
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,280
<i>And I guess that's the magic of him,</i>
<i>is Stewart Copeland</i>

692
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,080
<i>would make you feel comfortable</i>
<i>in the most uncomfortable drum part.</i>

695
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,880
Let's talk about events.

696
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,440
Keith Moon has many events in his playing,

697
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,040
and he takes cues from the music,
from the lyrics, from the topic.

698
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,080
The subject matter.

699
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,000
And so he is this orchestral drummer
with great chops,

700
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,840
and he picks and chooses
these events to happen.

701
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,640
And people, when they hear Moon,

702
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,320
they think maybe it's just chaos
and he's all over the place.

703
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,400
And if you'd listen to this track, he's
got different themes, different ideas.

704
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,640
And he uses them
and takes the song to another level.

705
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,640
Dynamics, peaks and valleys,
the beginning.

<i>and disco was big back then.</i>

710
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,760
<i>I think he was</i>
<i>nodding his hat to disco.</i>

711
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:01,360
<i>And then to see that he took this</i>
<i>hi-hat part and made it special.</i>

712
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:06,040
As the song grows into the first verse,
he reacts off the lyrics.

"I'm exactly connected to the lyrics

719

and the music,
and the subtleties of the story."

720
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,120
And I think that's the brilliance
of Keith Moon is his storytelling.

721
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,520

Always unpredictable.

726
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
Even when I play to the song, I remember,

727
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,560
"Oh, he starts the fill on the one,
not one and." And it always reminds me

728
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,080
of how different he is and how he thinks.

729
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,080
So I love the challenge of the song

730
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,800
because of these great themes,
we have the hi-hat intro,

731
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,800
the pocket verse with the big fills,

732
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,520
the choruses, which go from hat
to ride, but very reactive.

733
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Then, of course, the big…

734
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,720
I call it the timpani part,
but it's mallets on toms,

735
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,280
which he brings that orchestral event
like I was talking about.

736
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,400
<i>I love going to see a symphony.</i>
<i>And I think Keith</i>

737
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,760
<i>would watch and listen to that</i>
<i>and bring it all into his playing.</i>

738
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,160
<i>And he would take these moments</i>
<i>and bring them to life.</i>

739
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,960
♪ <i>Who are you?</i>
<i>Who, who, who, who? ♪</i>

740
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,960
♪ <i>Who are you?</i>
<i>Who, who, who, who? ♪</i>

741
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,280
♪ <i>Who are you? ♪</i>

742
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,960
And I think the energy

761
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,840
He wouldn't just send
the television out of the window,

762
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,120
he would make sure it was
working all the way down.

763
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,920
So he would get coax for the aerial,
and he'd get an extension lead

764

00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,480

775
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,800

778

So now instead of having

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,600
which would be a drum and a snare
and a skin moving,

{\an8}big thing about a drum machine,
it's a really punchy sound.

792
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,640
The LinnDrum was a drum machine
that became a classic, first of all,

793
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,600
because it sounded a bit
like a drummer.

794
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,760
It was a computer

795
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,880
with the ideal drum sound stored,
and it was ready to go.

796
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,800
You just hit play and record, and boom,
you were off.

797
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,960
And it always come back as you put it in.

798
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,240
So it's a big change.

799
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,360
Well, this is the LinnDrum
known as the Linn 2.

800
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,600
You can put it in record.

801
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,520
See this clip going round,
when it gets to the beginning hi-hat…

802
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,960
Then you can put the kick and snare.

803
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,840
Turn the click down.

In the '80s,
when the electric drum sound

810
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,240
became so important in the music,
there was a sense that the drummer

811
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:05,480
and the opinion of the drummer
and all the backstory of the drummer

812
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,400
wasn't needed any more, and was like
putting on a drum machine on an organ.

817
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,400
And as a young man, I loved

The impact of the drum machine
has affected music in a lot of ways.

822
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,200
It became very regimented, you know.

823
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:56,640
And the human element of the feel
was taken out, you know,

824
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:02,160
and I like the human element,
because I'm a human being.

825
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,720
{\an8}I look back at the '80s
and think about MTV.

826
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,080
And what you saw on TV
was what you wanted to replicate.

827
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,880
"Oh, this looks cool."

828
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,800
And the drummer's got a big
drum set, and there was a spectacle,

829
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:50,360
the camera and the playfulness the drummer
gets with the camera and the attitude.

830
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,680
And nothing's better
than watching a drummer move.

831
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,120
And so people get a chance to kinda
tune in to what drummers can do,

832
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,160
what's possible.

"Oh, the guys with socks on their dicks,"

877

882

883
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,480
I had long hair, bandanna,
cutoff shirt, and they looked at me,

885

01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,760
and see if they can, like,
go there to the next level."

888
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,760
And later they talked about it, like,

889
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,480
"You were the first guy that really
took over on the audition.

890
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,680
Everyone kind of just played along."

891
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,240
<i>It's an intangible thing,</i>
<i>that chemistry.</i>

892
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,200
<i>And I've been fortunate to be in groups</i>

893
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,680
<i>that have had it, and certainly</i>
<i>Red Hot Chili Peppers do.</i>

894
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,440
So you get together, and you jam.

895
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,440
Key of A, key of G, whatever.

896
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:00,400
Somebody starts it. You all just jam.

897
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:05,560
Right? When I sat in that room
and played and jammed with the band,

898
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,520
there was a magic. There…

899
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,560
I knew that I was where I should be.

900
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,840
And it took me almost ten years
of my professional career

901
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,520
to find the same like-minded
four other guys that were there

902
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,840
for the same reasons, to make that
great music that we all made in that room.

{\an8}When I was 22,
I auditioned for the band Hole,

908
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:59,640
{\an8}and I was one of 22, 23 drummers,
and I got the gig that day.

909
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,720
I always say, you know, you say it
and it happens,

910
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,000
like, you just put it out there.

911
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,080
So a couple of months later,
Hole is on hiatus,

912
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,480
and I get a phone call
one morning at 7:00 a.m.

913
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,160
"Nikki Sixx is looking
for your phone number,"

914
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,040
and I seriously thought I was sleeping.

915
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,880
I thought I was dreaming
and I was like, "What?"

916
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,200
She's like, "Their drummer's ill."

917
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,680
And so Nikki called me
and asked if I would be

918
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,440
interested in playing Mötley Crüe.

919
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,760
And I was like, "Are you serious?

920
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,240
If you're serious,
I'll fly out right now."

921
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,040
So I was on a plane that day.

922
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,200
I had notation paper and I was listening
to all the songs notating them.

923
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,560
And I was like, "I don't even need this.
I know every song by heart."

924
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,280
Now, I don't know if you've
noticed tonight,

925
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,920
but we got a girl playing drums tonight.

926
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,520
I thought it was going
to be a few days,

927
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,720
and it wound up being six months

928
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:05,320
that I was working with the band and,
you know, it was the dream of my life.

929
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,880
My, you know, 12-year-old self

930
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,960
was watching them on MTV,
and now I'm playing in the band.

931
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,080
Unfortunately, I didn't
have the drum cage.

932
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,640
No, but I did have some
rock 'n' roll stories from that time.

933
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,000
There are people, like,
"Are you kidding me?"

934
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,880
"I'm not going to this concert."

935
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,960
"Hell, no.
A girl drummer, Mötley Crüe, what?"

936
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,880
And then by the end of the concert,
they would see the same people,

937
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,760
and they would be like,
"She blew my mind!"

938
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,360
"Oh, my God."

939
01:06:54,440 --> 01:07:00,280
So, watching the fans' reaction,
of them just wanting to hate me so bad,

940
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,760
and by the end of the night,
I won the entire crowd over.

941
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:05,880
- Hell, yeah, Sam, you rock.
- Thank you so much.

942
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

943
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,640
This is what it's about.

944
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,960

947
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,760

948
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,160

playing drums? You're a little girl."

949
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,080
I would be kicked out
of my own dressing room

950
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,680
because, you know, the security guard
thought that I was just a random fan

951
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,520
that was backstage trying
to hang out with the band,

952
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,400

967
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,200
came up on stage
while I was setting up my drums,

968
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,840
and he said, "Give me your sticks,
I'll sound check for you."

01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,800
{\an8}And when I got on stage
later that night and played,

973
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:51,800
I broke, I think, three or four drumsticks
'cause I was so mad.

974
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,280
I was like, "Oh, you want

-Nervous?

990
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,800
And I look forward to just trying
to continue to be better

991
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,640
and a better bandmate,
a better musician,

992
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,880
a better songwriter, uh, and just
play as well as I can all the time.

993
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:52,400
And I fucking love it and it's fun.

994
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,920
Playing the drums is fun.

995
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,160
And I can play my drums
all day, all night and I love it.

996
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:20,920
You know, I don't know if that's
a fault… I'm not really sure.

997
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,920
I've gotten into a little
bit of trouble with that,

998
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,240
you know, over the years.

999
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,760
I'm from North London.

1000
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,000
I didn't grow up with anything, really,

1001
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,840
apart from just this mad sort of,
like, obsession and love.

1002
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,120
The best thing
about being a drummer

1003
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:39,000
is I saw the world doing the job I love.

1004
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,280
You can't get better than that.

1005
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,560
It's the best feeling
in the world.

1006
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,440
I'm controlling the way this crowd
is moving, it's just me

1007
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,600
and 80,000 people in the stadium.

1008
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,880
And this is the coolest
fucking time of my life.

1009
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,200
If the guitar plug goes out
during a Rage show,

1010
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:01,240
it would be a bummer, but if
the kick drum pedal breaks,

1011
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,240
that's a problem.

1012
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,520
You have 100,000 people, like,
"Now what?" You know?

I don't know what my life
would be without drums.

1014
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,600
Everything that has come along
with me playing drums

1015
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:18,880
has been so rewarding,
I would never trade any of it.
