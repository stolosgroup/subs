That doesn't sound like a hack.

703
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,087
Normally, they would take money out,
if they were hacking you.

I don't know,

00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,847
Shut up.

777
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,082
[Liv] Sydney, come back.

778
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,604
[Chuck]
<i>Come on, yeah, there you go.</i>

779
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,296
- [girl] You don't have to do this.
- Take your time, Syd, don't look down.

780
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,129
[Liv] This is a stupid game.

781
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,249
[Wes] Come on, we're right here.
You can always turn back, Syd.

782
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,536
Come on, come on, you got to film.

783
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,767
Sydney, it's not gonna
count unless you film it.

784
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,410
Don't worry about the phone.

785
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,244
She has to film it, she can't...

786
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,560
It doesn't count unless she
films it, she has to film it.

787
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,456
- [Liv] Just bail and come back.
- [Chuck] She has to film it.

788
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,847
- No, but she has to film it.
- [Wes] Shut up, Chuck.

789
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,921
Oh, my God.

790
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,443
I can't, oh, my God,
I can't, I can't.

791
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,816
[Chuck] Sydney, you got to get up,
you gotta do something.

792
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,127
Stop yelling at me, stop.

793
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,289
[Chuck]
She has to get it done.

794
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,203
[girl] Shut up.

795
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,456
[Chuck]
This is gonna take too long.

796
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,201
You got to stand, you got to walk.

797
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,725
Shut up!

798
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,290
Shut up, Chuck.

799
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:15,081
[boy]
You heard her, Chuck shut up.

800
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,925
[Chuck]
She's gotta get it done.

801
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,369
She's not gonna get here in time
unless she gets up and walks.

802
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,005
She has to, she's wasting time.

803
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,923
Shut up both of you.

804
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,844
[Chuck]
Come on Syd, you got this.

[girl] Vee.

00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:25,643
Hi, oh, my gosh, you guys
are so famous right now.

821
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:27,563
Oh, wait till Syd sees you.

822
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,530
- Where is she?
- Oh, you guys don't know?

823
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,201
Yeah, she tried to
walk across that ladder and just bailed.

824
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,936
- Is she out of the game?
- Yeah, let's get a drink.

825
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,042
Yeah, it wasn't pretty.

826
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,601
- Have you seen Sydney?
- Yeah.

827
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,681
Syd.

828
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,844
Oh, come on, Vee,
you never even spoke to him.

829
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,129
It's fine, certainly no surprise.

830
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,326
Sorry.

831
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,280
Yeah, I know it's not a surprise.
You know what's not fine though.

832
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,285
I almost died tonight, Vee,
and you were nowhere to be found.

833
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,840
I'm sorry, when you said
I should live my life,

834
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,321
did you mean I should live
my life in your shadow?

835
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,616
I was just trying to help you, Vee,

836
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,610
because you're the most
repressed person that I know.

837
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,206
Wasn't that why you keep me around?
Because I never tell you the truth?

838
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,044
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

839
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,646
I guess you don't tell me the truth.

840
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,883
Because you never told me
about how insecure I am.

841
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,885
Or about how I just have
a revolving door of guys all the time.

842
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,043
You never tell me that
but you've told everyone that tonight.

843
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,249
So please, Vee, go right
ahead and show us all

844
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,164
what a fiery little spark
plug you've become since lunch.

847
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,242
Don't walk away from me, Vee.

848
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,448
Wake up, this is a game.

849

Wait, you don't know me.

852
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,569
Oh, I'm sorry,
you really like her now?

853
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:03,880
Yeah, I do.

854
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,096
<i>Alright, come on Syd,
you're just drunk.</i>

855
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,202
<i>Tommy, it is time to get over her.</i>

856
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,408
Clearly she has traded up.

857
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,006
Why do you have to be such a bitch?

858
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:16,642
Look at that, little Vee
finally speaking her mind.

859
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,961
<i>Come on, unburden yourself.</i>

860
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,444
You know why we're best friends?
I do whatever you want all the time.

861
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,931
<i>No, Vee.</i>

862
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,450
<i>We're friends because
I'm fun and you're boring.</i>

863
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,646
The only fun thing about
you was your brother.

864
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,086
What is it you think?

865
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,004
That playing Nerve is just gonna
magically make you a different person?

866
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,641
That's not how life works,
you'll never be a player.

867
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,728
Right, right.

868
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,451
I know how much you love
living in the moment, Syd.

869
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,888
Well remember this
moment because you're one of those girls

870
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,564
who peaks in high school.

871
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,450
And you wake up one day still
living in Staten Island,

01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:58,965
still screwing the same guys,

873
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,168
wondering what the hell
happened to your life.

874
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,720
If you want to know
where I am from now on,

875
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,564

Wait, Vee, what are you doing?

01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,210
Hey, hey, Vee,
you don't need to do this.

879
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,296
Look at me, come on, let's just go.
Let's bail, alright?

880
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,560
What do you have to prove?

881
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,405
Come on, please, let's go.

882
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,167

That'll take you into first, Vee!

01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,481
That was messed up.

891
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,016
I can't deal with this
right now, I'm gonna go.

892
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,486
Vee, do you know that
he's played Nerve before?

893
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,686
What?

894
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,816
Yeah, it was his dare to get
you here and fight with Syd.

895
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,569
That's why he brought you here.

896
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,971
Look.

897
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,969
Do you still trust him?

898
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,565
Vee, wait, wait.

899
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,086
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

900
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,004
Did you take me here
as part of the game?

901
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,363
Answer me, is it true?

902
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,608
- What are you doing?
- It's more complicated than that.

903
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,603
I just lost my
two best friends tonight.

904
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,320
- I know.
- How much did you get for that?

905
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,496
No, no, it's not about
the money, alright?

906
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:08,488
But I promise,
I'll explain to you later.

907
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,976
Just don't even bother, okay?
I mean, Sydney almost died tonight.

908
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,526
- I almost died tonight.
- Vee, I know, I know.

909
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,921
This game is sick,
I'm going to the police.

910
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,604
Wait, no, no, no.

911
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,444
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

912
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,576
I'm sorry, you can't do that, alright?
You can't go to the police.

913
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,921
Why not?
Because I'll lose the game?

914
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,209
No, it's not about that.
Vee, Vee.

915
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,210
You can't go to the police.
It's the last thing you wanna do.

916
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,682
Vee, wait, I was trying to hurt you.
It just got out of control.

917
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,206
- [crowd chattering]
- Move, just get out of my way.

918
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:40,767
Officer!

919
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:48,683
Officer, officer, I need help. I'm
playing this game, it's called Nerve.

920
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,650
And I'm worried that someone's
gonna get really hurt.

921
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,087
Snitch.

922
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,568
- That game, are they playing too?
- Yeah.

923
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,324
Dude, get out of this.

924
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,363
Is there a crime being committed?

925
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,809
No, but a kid could die tonight.

926
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,696
Look, here, it's all on
my phone, you can see.
