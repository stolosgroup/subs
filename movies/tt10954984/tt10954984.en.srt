1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,760
<i>And of course I set it to
Icelandic time because we share</i>

2
00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:07,796
<i>a love of the aurora borealis,
Gordy.</i>

3
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:11,098
<i>And you have no idea
how to tell time.</i>

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,535
<i>Great gift, Dad.</i>

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,302
<i>Way to think things through.</i>

6
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:17,104
<i>Somehow, you'd think that a man</i>

7
00:00:17,137 --> 00:00:19,106
<i>who can send a rocket
into space would be able</i>

8
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:21,776
<i>to manage a halfway decent
birthday present.</i>

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,111
<i>Nope.</i>

10
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:26,715
<i>You know, Gordy,
all things considered,</i>

11
00:00:26,748 --> 00:00:29,083
<i>maybe my gift
isn't so bad after all.</i>

12
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,652
<i>Aw.</i>

13
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:33,387
<i>Hey, Gordy. Surprise!</i>

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,056
<i>Wow! Now, there's a gift.</i>

15
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:39,159
<i>Here you go, Gordy.</i>

16
00:00:39,193 --> 00:00:41,663
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

17
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:44,131
<i>Oh, beautiful, Haley.</i>

18
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,433
<i>Aw.</i>

00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:02,352
Good morning on what is

21
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:03,712
sure to be a windy one.

22
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:05,379
We have a high wind warning

23
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:07,916
for the L.A. County coast
and valleys

24
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:11,418
with some clouds sure to
come in around 10:00 a.m.

25
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:14,656
And even though the high gust
warning will, um, expire

26
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,358
mid to late morning,
you'll still want to keep...

27
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:19,570
The search
for a group of missing hikers

28
00:02:19,594 --> 00:02:23,297
is set to resume this morning
just outside Agua Dulce.

29
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,366
The tour group went out
two days ago

30
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:27,377
and on the Pacific Crest Trail.

31
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,638
But didn't come back
as expected that night.

32
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:31,539
Crews started searching
yesterday morning...

33
00:02:31,573 --> 00:02:33,642
And traffic is already backed up

34
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,878
due to an accident
on the southbound 101.

35
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:39,714
It is 7:44 with Bo and Ives.

36
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,359
Bang.

37
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,535
Bang.

38
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:02,737
Bang.

39
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,305
Whoa. Come on.

40
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:08,943
Down, down.

41
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:10,612
Down, down, down.

42
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:12,914
Bang! Yes, a good boy.

43
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:14,816
Up. Up, up.

44
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:16,851
Okay, up. Up, up.

45
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:20,354
Got to keep our heads up
out the clouds on this one.

46
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:22,289
I know.

47
00:03:28,496 --> 00:03:31,298
Now, we land this...

48
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:33,735
Yeah. Like <i>Six Guns.</i>

49
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,870
I mean, we really put on a show,

50
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:39,974
well, you know they're gonna
bring us back for the sequel.

51
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:41,643
Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:41,676 --> 00:03:45,613
Well, we sure as hell ain't
got to sell no more horses.

53
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:47,782
So just execute.

54
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,219
And we ain't got
no more problems. Mm.

55
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,357
You good?

56
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,628
You good?

57
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:04,699
Where your sister?

58
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:06,634
What's that about?

59
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:09,604
- She's supposed to be here.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:32,660
Goddamn it.

61
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,430
Thought I told you
to fix the damn walker.

62
00:04:43,705 --> 00:04:45,707
You hear that?

63
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,430
Pops.

64
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:34,489
- Come on, come on. Pop.
- Firefly.

65
00:05:34,522 --> 00:05:36,558
- What else? What else?
- Ghost.

66
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:37,892
Uh-huh.

67
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,093
Beethoven.

68
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:40,562
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

69
00:05:40,595 --> 00:05:42,897
- Commodore.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:44,431
Virgil.

71
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,967
You good. You good.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,569
You good. You good.

73
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,003
You good, man. You good.

74
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,147
- Ghost.
- You good. You good. You good.

75
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,739
- Pops?
- Lucky.

76
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:54,075
- Pops. Pops.
- Commodore.

77
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,610
Pops!

78
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:16,918
OJ.

79
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,553
Oh. Hi, horsie.

80
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,097
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
look him in the eyes, please.

81
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,556
Okay.

82
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:22,800
You ready to do
the safety meeting?

83
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,625
Uh, I'm gonna need like five...

84
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,627
Um, my team's almost here.

85
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:27,996
Your team's not here.

86
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,697
Okay. Hold.

87
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:31,632
Sorry, I got the horse guy
talking to me, too.

88
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,668
- What's up? Copy.
- Safety meeting at the...

89
00:08:33,701 --> 00:08:36,571
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Bonnie Clayton on set.

90
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:38,706
Here she is, everybody.

91
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,310
Take a look at all of that.

92
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:46,681
Fynn, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

93
00:08:46,714 --> 00:08:48,750
You remember these guys
from <i>Flash Point.</i>

94
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:50,018
Yeah. Hi.

95
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:51,152
Uh...

96
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,888
Your name is OJ?

97
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:55,790
Yeah, Otis Junior.

98
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,258
Oh.

99
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,860
Uh...

100
00:08:59,694 --> 00:09:02,630
Where's the o.. The other guy?

101
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:04,665
- The-the-the senior guy?
- Dude, he died.

102
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,267
About six months ago.

103
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,336
A bunch of random shit
fell out of a plane.

104
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,304
So I guess we're stuck
with Junior over here.

105
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:12,573
- No.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:14,042
Okay.

107
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:16,177
Fuck. Great.

108
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,047
Uh, Ant, how we looking?

109
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:23,084
Yeah, good, if we're selling
a horse's ass.

110
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:25,653
That's, uh,

111
00:09:25,686 --> 00:09:27,664
legendary cinematographer
Antlers Holst over here...

112
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,090
Let's go ahead
and spin the horse.

113
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:30,792
But you had said "hold," so...

114
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,336
And now I'm saying "spin." Let's go.

115
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,763
Great. And while that's
spinning, can we get makeup?

116
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,900
Get makeup for
Ms. Bonnie Clayton, please.

117
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:39,801
Hold on.

118
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,936
Can you step away
from the back, please?

119
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,280
They told me to come here.

120
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,206
Good call, OJ.
Um, tell you what,

121
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:47,208
let's do a quick safety meeting.

122
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:50,144
Guys, this is OJ,
our horse trainer.

123
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:52,346
Take it away.

124
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,216
Kill the music, please.

125
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:09,163
My name is OJ. Uh...

126
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:11,833
I think my sister's
gonna be here in a minute.

127
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:14,111
Little louder, please.
We cannot hear you in the back.

128
00:10:14,135 --> 00:10:16,737
I said we are animal wranglers

129
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:18,706
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

130
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:23,377
And, uh... did you know
the very first, uh, assem...

131
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,745
Hey, yo!

132
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,380
Excuse me. Sorry.

133
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:28,416
I'm so sorry about that.
Let me do that.

134
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:29,851
Sorry, brother.

135
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,719
- Safety meeting.
- Yeah.

136
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:36,124
Hello! How y'all doing?

137
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,658
Sorry for the tardiness.

138
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,427
My name is Emerald, that's OJ,

139
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,362
and we are
your animal wranglers today

140
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,064
with Haywood Hollywood Horses.

141
00:10:43,097 --> 00:10:45,733
Now, did you know
that the very first

142
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,735
assembly of photographs
in sequential order

143
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,137
to create a motion picture

144
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,739
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

145
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:53,441
Yes, it was. Yes, it was.
Look it up.

146
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,877
Now, I know you guys know
Eadweard Muybridge,

147
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,678
the grandfather
of motion pictures

148
00:10:57,712 --> 00:10:59,289
who took the pictures
that created that clip,

149
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:01,716
but does anybody know the name
of the Black jockey

150
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,184
that rode the horse?

151
00:11:04,452 --> 00:11:06,087
No.

152
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,023
Nope? I mean,
the very first stuntman,

153
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:11,826
animal wrangler and movie star
all rolled into one,

154
00:11:11,859 --> 00:11:13,861
and there is literally
no record of him.

155
00:11:13,895 --> 00:11:16,764
That man was a Bahamian jockey

156
00:11:16,797 --> 00:11:18,966
that went by the name
of Alistair E. Haywood.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,170
And he is
my great-great-grandfather.

158
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:24,772
- Great.
- There's another "great" grandfather.

159
00:11:24,805 --> 00:11:26,741
That's why
back at the Haywood Ranch,

160
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:28,910
as the only Black-owned
horse trainers in Hollywood,

161
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:32,180
we like to say, "Since the
moment pictures could move,

162
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,182
we had skin in the game."

163
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,853
All right, let's get into
some, uh, safety precautions

164
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:40,321
while we're on set, shall we?

165
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,790
Number one, please refrain
from making any loud noises,

166
00:11:42,823 --> 00:11:44,401
sudden movements,
and keep your cell phones off.

167
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:45,993
We'd really appreciate that.

168
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,905
Two, if you see anything
that looks or feels unsafe,

169
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:50,464
contact me, OJ or your second
in chain of command.

170
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,100
And three,
let's have a great shoot!

171
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:55,269
Uh, and I'm Emerald Haywood.

172
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,904
I direct, write, produce, act.

173
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,041
Uh, motorcycles, baby.

174
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,451
Look, I-I make
a mean grilled cheese

175
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,843
if you're looking for crafty.

176
00:12:02,877 --> 00:12:05,746
Just-just holler at me.

177
00:12:07,982 --> 00:12:09,518
Okay, that was great.

178
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:11,152
That was... that was a lot.

179
00:12:11,185 --> 00:12:12,820
Uh, let's do a rehearsal.

180
00:12:12,853 --> 00:12:14,922
- Yeah? Rehearsal?
- Rehearsing, we should.

181
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,791
We should do one. Rehearsing.

182
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,493
I think...
I think he might need a break.

183
00:12:18,527 --> 00:12:19,870
Yeah, we'll rehearse one first,

184
00:12:19,894 --> 00:12:20,962
and then break, yeah?

185
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:22,430
Well, I'm ready to do one.

186
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:23,907
OJ, she's...
she's ready to do one.

187
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:25,309
Tell the horse
we're ready to do one.

188
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:28,269
VFX, can we get the ball
in here while we have a sec?

189
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:30,505
- Em.
- VFX. Uh, and, OJ,

190
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:31,839
you can... you can step off.

191
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:32,974
Step out. Step off.

192
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:34,242
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh, step out.

193
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:35,443
Em?

194
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:36,844
What's the horse's name?

195
00:12:36,877 --> 00:12:38,346
- Uh, Lucky.
- Lucky.

196
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,215
- Is he?
- VFX!

197
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:42,517
Yeah. Em?

198
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:44,294
- Uh, OJ, let's step off.
- You calling me?

199
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:45,862
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I'm trying to work.

200
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:47,388
What'd I tell you
about that, man?

201
00:12:47,421 --> 00:12:49,199
Hey, man, if she can't
get near the back of the horse,

202
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:50,867
- what are we doing here?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! -

203
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:52,169
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

204
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:53,370
- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Medic.

205
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,795
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

206
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:56,197
- Are you okay?
- Whoa, whoa.

207
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,012
<i>Look,
maybe it's just too soon, huh?</i>

208
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:12,547
<i>Yeah, it's not the gig.
Not ready yet.</i>

209
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:14,516
Right?

210
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:16,150
- We need it, man.
- No, I know.

211
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:18,152
Your dad left an enormous hole.
I know that.

212
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,388
But don't worry,
there'll be others.

213
00:13:20,421 --> 00:13:22,156
All right? I'm sorry.

214
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:23,424
- And...
- Sorry.

215
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:24,925
Just, you tell her sorry.

216
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,528
Thank you for the opportunity.

217
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,962
Come on, now.

218
00:13:27,995 --> 00:13:29,397
Oh, where's VFX?

219
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,566
Oh, all right. You got it.

220
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,968
Sorry, that was...

221
00:13:34,969 --> 00:13:36,837
So, where am I dropping you?

222
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm-a go up with you.

223
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:41,576
I need to get some shit.

224
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,879
My little girl said, you know,
I could crash at her place,

225
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,480
so I'll be gone in the morning.

226
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:49,417
So I'm gonna drive you back
tomorrow?

227
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,252
I can find a ride.

228
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:54,455
But, I mean, like, can I get
fun OJ out this bitch?

229
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:56,324
'Cause this wack-ass OJ

230
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,126
is really making me feel
like I'm not loved.

231
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,596
Is that how you want
your little sister to feel?

232
00:14:57,318 --> 00:14:59,521
What happened to Gold Rush?

233
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:01,956
Gold Rush went bankrupt.

234
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,659
It's been this for three years.

235
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,427
- Damn.
- Howdy, folks.

236
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,963
Welcome to Jupiter's Claim.

237
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:11,533
Step on up for the wishing well.

238
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,067
Get your Jupe Jangle.

239
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,420
Go on,
take a picture at the well.

240
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:18,973
Cowboys and cowgirls,

241
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:20,441
just a little heads-up.

242
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:24,078
Join us Fridays at 5:30 p.m.
for the brand-spanking-new.

243
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,680
Jupiter's Claim
Star Lasso Experience.

244
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,157
Come on over
to the Sundae Saloon.

245
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,718
Get your ice-cold sarsaparilla.

246
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,657
Look at this. I've never
seen anything like it.

247
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:41,530
- Oh, shi...
- Come on.

248
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:43,130
I'm sorry, y'all. I'm sorry.

249
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,566
- Photo bomb.
- You ruined it.

250
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,100
- Yeah, my bad.
- Gold, I tell you.

251
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,537
They got gold up in here.

252
00:15:49,538 --> 00:15:51,038
Lucky.

253
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:52,507
Hang tight.

254
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,609
I'll be back.

255
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:56,377
Let's go.

256
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:16,330
How many you sold?

257
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:17,732
How many?

258
00:16:17,766 --> 00:16:19,601
Ten.

259
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,402
You sold ten of Pops' horses?

260
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:23,037
I'm gonna get 'em back.

261
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,206
- Can you stay out here?
- Why?

262
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:27,107
I'm developing
a business relationship,

263
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:28,610
and you're a liability
right now.

264
00:16:28,643 --> 00:16:30,010
How am I a liability?

265
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:31,378
How are you a lia...

266
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,749
Don't promote your fucking
side shit on the job.

267
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:37,051
- Oh, my God.
- Actor, singer, dancer,

268
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,086
seamstress, motorcycles.

269
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:41,388
You want to promote something,
promote this business.

270
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:42,757
No, OJ. No.

271
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,459
First of all, that's not
my side shit. This is.

272
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:48,697
And second of all, if anybody's
a liability...

273
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,165
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

274
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,636
Hi there. It's Amber
again from Jupe's Claim.

275
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:57,506
It does look like we were able
to squeeze out, uh,

276
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:00,074
a couple of extra press passes

277
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:03,512
for the upcoming
friends and family preview.

278
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:07,081
Oh. No apology necessary.

279
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:09,350
This is in reference
to the biggest, bestest,

280
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,553
brand-new live show we have
coming up here at the park,

281
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:13,588
- which is sneaking up on us...
- Come in.

282
00:17:13,622 --> 00:17:15,332
If you'd like, I can
go ahead and put you down...

283
00:17:15,356 --> 00:17:17,191
OJ.

284
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,425
Thanks for coming up.

285
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,495
How you doing?
This is my sister Em.

286
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,329
Hi there.

287
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:26,267
So, uh... who'd you bring me?

288
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,836
Uh, Lucky.

289
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,070
He's my second-best horse,
you know, uh...

290
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,606
He lost focus.

291
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,476
So, uh... I mean, I did, too,
but I can't fire myself.

292
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,479
- That's good.
- Hold up.

293
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:40,147
This you?

294
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,717
You literally the Asian kid
from <i>Kid Sheriff?</i>

295
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,294
- Em, Em, Em, Em...
- No, it's okay.

296
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:46,320
Yeah, I was, uh...
I was Lil' Jupe.

297
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,322
Ah, dude, you were
literally my favorite.

298
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:50,090
You mind if I get
a picture real quick?

299
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:51,726
Hey, you mind if we talk?

300
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,161
Yes. Of course.

301
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,163
Please, browse away.

302
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:58,232
<i>Su casa es mi casa.</i>

303
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,434
Thank you. I sure will.

304
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:02,804
Um, so...

305
00:18:02,837 --> 00:18:04,606
same deal, yeah? Eleven-five?

306
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:07,174
- Yeah. Thank you.
- That's 3D. Yeah.

307
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,644
Whatever happened to that
Black boy? He was good.

308
00:18:09,678 --> 00:18:11,345
Stop, stop.

309
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,882
He was good.

310
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:16,585
I actually wanted to, uh,
lay some groundwork,

311
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:19,854
uh, to a pathway of-of, uh,
buying some of them back.

312
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,455
All right?

313
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,491
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:25,326
Yeah. Totally.

315
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,596
Um...

316
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:28,697
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

317
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,632
Actually, OJ,

318
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:33,467
the offer I made your dad
is still on the table.

319
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:34,468
Oh, uh...

320
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:36,771
- Let me... Let...
- Yo, wait a minute.

321
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,841
So, that...

322
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:42,343
OJ, have I shown you this?

323
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:45,747
This is in reference
to the <i>Gordy's Home</i> incident.

324
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:49,818
<i>Gordy's Home.</i> Yeah, yeah.

325
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:53,253
So, <i>Gordy's Home</i> is
a short-lived but fabled sitcom

326
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:55,890
I starred in in '96
after <i>Kid Sheriff</i> blew up.

327
00:18:55,924 --> 00:18:57,525
Yeah, my pops told me
about this show.

328
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,928
The-the monkey went crazy
or some shit.

329
00:18:59,961 --> 00:19:03,665
You know, I usually charge
a fee for this.

330
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:07,769
Oh, damn.

331
00:19:07,802 --> 00:19:09,604
Ta-da.

332
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:11,472
Hmm.

333
00:19:16,511 --> 00:19:18,379
That's the first
exploding fist bump.

334
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:20,180
What? Really?

335
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:21,616
Y'all came up with that?

336
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,919
So, as I was saying, uh,
<i>Gordy's Home</i> began airing

337
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:27,321
in the fall of '96...

338
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:29,591
...and it was an immediate hit.

339
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:31,526
Uh, ratings were huge.

340
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,193
Pretty good reviews.

341
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,929
Just really took off.

342
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:36,665
Yeah.

343
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:40,669
Then, uh, one day...

344
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:43,571
...we were shooting an episode

345
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:46,908
in season two entitled, uh,
"Gordy's Birthday."

346
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:50,477
And, um... boom.

347
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,915
One of the chimps
that plays Gordy just...

348
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:55,583
just hit his limit.

349
00:19:55,617 --> 00:20:00,387
And it was six minutes
and 13 seconds of havoc.

350
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,858
Network tried to bury hit,
but it was a spectacle.

351
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:05,960
People are just obsessed.

352
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:07,394
You're kidding me.

353
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:09,396
OJ, you said you heard
about that?

354
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,833
Mm-hmm. That's why
they don't let you use chimps.

355
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,835
That's part of the reason.

356
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:17,237
There's a growing <i>Gordy's Home</i>
fan base out there now.

357
00:20:17,271 --> 00:20:18,840
This Dutch couple paid me 50K

358
00:20:18,873 --> 00:20:20,608
to come in here
and spend the night.

359
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:22,510
I didn't ask.

360
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:23,712
That's crazy.

361
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:29,651
So, what happened really, man?

362
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,355
You haven't seen
the Bad Gordy sketch on <i>SNL?</i>

363
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,826
I mean, they pretty much
nailed it better than I could.

364
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:40,495
- Mm.
- No?

365
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:42,764
<i>Saturday Night Live?</i>

366
00:20:42,797 --> 00:20:44,933
Darrell Hammond as Tom.

367
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:47,468
Ana Gasteyer as Phyllis.

368
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:50,605
Cheri Oteri as Mary Jo Elliot.

369
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:53,007
Scott Wolf is the host.
He's me.

370
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,375
But, of course,
the star of the sketch

371
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,345
is Chris goddamn Kattan
as Gordy,

372
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,682
and he is...

373
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:02,751
undeniable, okay?

374
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,552
Bit goes like this.

375
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,888
Everyone's trying to celebrate
Gordy's birthday,

376
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:11,860
but every time Gordy hears
something about the jungle,

377
00:21:11,893 --> 00:21:15,395
Gordy.. Kattan.. Goes off.

378
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,500
And it's... it's Kattan.

379
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,769
He's just crushing it.

380
00:21:20,802 --> 00:21:22,771
He is a force of nature.

381
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:26,007
He is killing on that stage.

382
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,083
Yeah.

383
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:37,384
It's legendary.

384
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,319
Legendary shit.

385
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:41,656
Yeah.

386
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:43,357
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
go ahead,

387
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,935
look that one up on YouTube.

388
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,393
Details, you know?

389
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:47,929
Totally.

390
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,768
I got some work I got to do.

391
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:56,971
So we ain't gonna chill
tonight, nothing?

392
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:59,641
- You want to work?
- Hell no.

393
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:05,947
So, uh, what was the offer?

394
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,315
- Jupe?
- Yeah.

395
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,718
He offered to buy the ranch.

396
00:22:10,752 --> 00:22:12,053
Oh, really?

397
00:22:12,086 --> 00:22:14,022
That's interesting. How much?

398
00:22:14,055 --> 00:22:15,824
Why?

399
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:19,727
'Cause... I'm trying to see
how big of a dumb-ass you are.

400
00:22:20,962 --> 00:22:22,797
Big dumb-ass, probably.

401
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:40,447
So I guess you don't want
to see what's good

402
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,382
with Dad liquor cabinet,
then, huh?!

403
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:51,626
I got that hobby weed, too,
actually.

404
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:54,963
That's all you had to say, then.

405
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:56,463
The hobby weed.

406
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,142
That's all you had to say,
just let me know.

407
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,767
You should've dropped that
at the top.

408
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,669
"I got the hobby weed."
You know I'm ready.

409
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:10,712
Okay, your reflexes
are still quick. Like, whoa.

410
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:13,581
- I ain't mad at it.
- I'm watching.

411
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:21,556
Drink.

412
00:23:26,194 --> 00:23:28,496
Oh, shit.

413
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,498
Remember Jean Jacket?

414
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:32,901
Yeah, good horse.

415
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:35,970
Supposed to be
my first horse, actually.

416
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:38,139
I was just talking
to my therapist about this

417
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,074
- not too long ago.
- Therapist?

418
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:43,912
Yes. I fuck one
on occasion sometimes.

419
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:48,850
I was telling her that,
for my ninth birthday,

420
00:23:48,883 --> 00:23:51,719
I was supposed to get
to train Jean Jacket.

421
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:54,155
But then Pops got
some Western, and...

422
00:23:54,188 --> 00:23:56,024
Jean Jacket wasn't mine no more.

423
00:23:56,057 --> 00:23:58,593
Classic Otis Senior.

424
00:23:58,626 --> 00:24:00,862
I distinctly remember...

425
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,464
...standing right here
at this window,

426
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:07,101
watching y'all train my horse.

427
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:08,803
My horse.

428
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,941
Pops never looked up at me.

429
00:24:12,974 --> 00:24:14,676
Whoa, now.

430
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,878
Whoa, now. Whoa, now.

431
00:24:17,979 --> 00:24:19,781
OJ, come on.

432
00:24:26,521 --> 00:24:29,090
But you did, nigga.

433
00:24:29,123 --> 00:24:31,025
Remember?

434
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:36,564
It was <i>Scorpion King,</i> actually.

435
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:38,599
It wasn't a Western.

436
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,503
That was the first job
Pops took me on.

437
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:44,672
Wasn't much fun.

438
00:24:44,706 --> 00:24:47,608
Ended up using camels
anyways, so...

439
00:24:49,944 --> 00:24:52,213
The point is...

440
00:24:52,246 --> 00:24:54,549
Yeah, fuck the point.

441
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,285
Yo, that man was
hardheaded as fuck.

442
00:24:57,318 --> 00:24:59,220
And so are you.

443
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,855
That's it.

444
00:25:05,326 --> 00:25:07,662
But at the end of the day,
you got to...

445
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:10,531
you got to admit, man, Pops...

446
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:16,004
Pops did something
when he made this place.

447
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:19,874
He changed the industry.

448
00:25:19,907 --> 00:25:21,909
That's real.

449
00:25:23,711 --> 00:25:25,847
I can't just let that go.

450
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:30,051
Why is Ghost in the arena?

451
00:25:57,845 --> 00:25:59,714
What's good?

452
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:06,687
Yeah.

453
00:26:31,112 --> 00:26:33,881
Hey, yo, Em. Em!

454
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,349
Turn it down!

455
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:36,851
All right!

456
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:52,266
Hey!

457
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,135
Where he going?

458
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,681
What if I...

459
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:45,052
What if I told you...

460
00:27:46,854 --> 00:27:49,924
...you'll leave here different?

461
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,932
See, every Friday
for the last six months...

462
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:03,171
...my family and I bore witness

463
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:05,439
to an absolute

464
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:07,375
Spectacle.

465
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,749
Huh?

466
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,078
You see it? The power?

467
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,147
Where's Ghost?

468
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:24,285
- I don't know.
- Hold on.

469
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:33,528
Boom. Power went out.

470
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:36,030
- See?
- Rewind.

471
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:43,037
Stop.

472
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:45,973
Ghost talking about,
"I ain't listening.

473
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,909
I'm not trained.
I do whatever the fuck I want."

474
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,846
What?

475
00:29:51,879 --> 00:29:53,781
What'd you see?

476
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,058
What's a bad miracle?

477
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:06,093
Hmm?

478
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:09,797
They got a word for that?

479
00:30:11,332 --> 00:30:13,067
Nope.

480
00:30:14,068 --> 00:30:17,038
They said it was a prop plane
or something that killed Pops.

481
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,610
That shit ain't never
made sense to me.

482
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:23,444
Then tonight,
I heard Ghost make a sound

483
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:24,979
I ain't never heard
a horse make.

484
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:27,214
What did you see? Hmm?

485
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:30,484
It was big.

486
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,486
- How big?
- Big.

487
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:35,222
- What'd it look like?
- I don't know.

488
00:30:39,894 --> 00:30:41,929
It was fast.

489
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:44,932
Too fast.

490
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:47,168
Too quiet to be a plane.

491
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,537
OJ.

492
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:52,373
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

493
00:30:59,046 --> 00:31:00,625
I'm telling you, man,
we don't need a lot.

494
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,116
We just need enough
to make our shit

495
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:03,427
look different
from what's out there.

496
00:31:03,451 --> 00:31:04,919
You get what I'm saying?
Like...

497
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:06,296
You know I ain't trying
to run it up.

498
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,223
I just was looking online,
and I seen a lot of shit.

499
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:10,925
You know I'm broke, right?

500
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:13,394
We'll use my money.

501
00:31:13,427 --> 00:31:15,229
Okay, shut up. Look.

502
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:16,665
All right.

503
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:18,633
There it is.
Five to a hundred K.

504
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,335
- Well, read it.
- You read it, dyslexic ass.

505
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:24,105
The point is
a website like Cyber Dominion

506
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,940
will pay five to a hundred K

507
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:28,376
for photographic evidence
of UFOs and shit.

508
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:30,177
A hundred K?

509
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:32,913
And that's just what I saw
on the first go.

510
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:36,384
Now that I'm thinking about it,
fuck Cyber Dominion.

511
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,653
This shit right here is
a moment.. Our moment.

512
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,655
We set it up,
release it the right way,

513
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:43,525
man, I'm talking
rich and famous for life.

514
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:45,126
How you doing? You look pretty.

515
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,695
She look like
she got a big house.

516
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:48,329
- How?
- How what? How we put it out?

517
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:49,997
- Mm.
- Well, that's what I'm saying.

518
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,542
We don't just go for
the quick cash-in, okay?

519
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:54,268
We-we go to the most credible
platform to do the story.

520
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:56,137
- What's that? Like <i>Oprah?</i>
- Yeah.

521
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,181
Like <i>Oprah,</i> for example.
After that, everybody want in.

522
00:31:58,205 --> 00:31:59,541
Well, I'm saying there's plenty

523
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:01,041
of videos of flying shit online.

524
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:02,720
I saw one the other day.
That wasn't on <i>Oprah.</i>

525
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:04,546
Nigga, I didn't say <i>Oprah.</i>
You said <i>Oprah.</i>

526
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:06,213
You love <i>Oprah.</i>

527
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:08,291
Look, all I'm saying is
all that shit online is fake.

528
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:10,685
Low quality. Ain't nobody
gonna get what we gonna get.

529
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:12,153
What we gonna get?

530
00:32:12,186 --> 00:32:13,555
- The shot.
- What shot?

531
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:15,524
The shot. The money shot.

532
00:32:15,557 --> 00:32:17,992
Undeniable, singular, the...

533
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:21,328
- the <i>Oprah</i> shot.
- The <i>Oprah</i> shot?

534
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:23,164
Excuse me.

535
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:26,033
Hi. I can help you over here.

536
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:30,337
Hi.

537
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:32,249
Thank you for shopping at Fry's.

538
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:34,351
Did you guys find everything
you're looking for today?

539
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:36,410
Yes... Angel.

540
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:39,013
Oh. Great.

541
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:41,048
Um, actually, do you have
a card with us?

542
00:32:41,081 --> 00:32:42,450
No, thank you.

543
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:43,585
Uh, would you like one?

544
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:45,186
- Because it...
- No, thank you.

545
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:46,597
Would you like one of
our tech support personnel

546
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:48,022
to help you
with the installation?

547
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:50,291
No, no, no, no, no, thank you.

548
00:32:50,324 --> 00:32:51,726
Appreciate you.

549
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,395
All right, uh,
no help with the install.

550
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:57,031
Suit yourself.

551
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,567
Is it a hard install?

552
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,100
Well, for me, no.

553
00:33:00,134 --> 00:33:01,570
You're not gonna
be able to do it.

554
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:04,615
What happened?
Did you guys get robbed?

555
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:06,407
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, you know.

556
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,742
A lot of blackouts.

557
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,443
Take the camera out
from time to time.

558
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:11,713
All these new cameras,
they have backup battery power,

559
00:33:11,746 --> 00:33:13,682
so you should be fine.

560
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:16,417
But the outages affect the
power in the battery shit, too,

561
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,252
like cell phones.

562
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:20,120
Okay. All right.

563
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:24,358
Cell phones, they don't just
drop in power. Right?

564
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:26,460
I mean,
maybe your Wi-Fi drops out

565
00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:28,162
whenever your system dips.

566
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:31,465
So, that's technology.

567
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:36,370
Okay, or maybe you're in
a UFO hot spot.

568
00:33:36,403 --> 00:33:39,473
No one believes in that.

569
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,451
What's up?

570
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:53,522
Damn. Did not realize
you guys were this far out.

571
00:33:53,555 --> 00:33:55,055
Mm-hmm.

572
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:56,423
I don't mind, though.

573
00:33:56,457 --> 00:33:59,528
Smell of horse shit
and fresh air.

574
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:01,462
Right?

575
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,232
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

576
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:06,544
whoa, whoa, whoa.

577
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:07,702
Whoa. Look at me, man.

578
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,303
- Fuck.
- Don't do that. Don't yell.

579
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:10,471
Sorry, man.

580
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:12,807
Sorry if I was, like, a little
shut down this morning.

581
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:15,342
Just got out of
a four-year relationship.

582
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:16,443
You were fine.

583
00:34:16,477 --> 00:34:18,421
I know it's gonna sound
fucking cliché, all right,

584
00:34:18,445 --> 00:34:20,815
but I thought that
she was the one, you know?

585
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,851
Is this gonna take
longer than an hour?

586
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:25,152
This? Oh, shit, yeah.

587
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:27,254
- I'm-a go ahead and pop out.
- Where you going?

588
00:34:27,288 --> 00:34:29,123
I got to go to the store
and get something.

589
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:31,358
Don't worry about it.
You need anything?

590
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:36,330
Yo.

591
00:34:36,363 --> 00:34:39,166
Her name was, uh, Rebecca Diaz.

592
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:42,202
Yep, keep an eye out for her.

593
00:34:42,236 --> 00:34:45,306
She's an actress, model,
you know?

594
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:48,577
She booked a pilot
on The CW, so...

595
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,177
Yeah, fucking left me.

596
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:54,481
Yeah, fucking CW.

597
00:34:57,451 --> 00:35:00,154
- So, thing about this camera...
- Actually, can it swivel up?

598
00:35:00,187 --> 00:35:02,624
Uh, yeah.

599
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,896
- Boom.
- Little more?

600
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:10,532
More. Okay.

601
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,504
Yeah.

602
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:18,607
Mm.

603
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,575
Uh, yeah.

604
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:24,144
Mm-hmm.

605
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:39,360
Do you know they don't
call 'em UFOs anymore?

606
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:44,431
It's fucking UAPs now.

607
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,936
Why they got to change the name?

608
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,571
Yeah.

609
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:50,872
Exactly.

610
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:52,406
No, fuck it.
I-I'll tell you why

611
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:54,509
they changed the name,
all right?

612
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,911
It-it's 'cause they want
to keep us in the dark.

613
00:35:56,945 --> 00:35:58,913
Remember when they declassified

614
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:01,448
all that UFO footage
a couple years ago?

615
00:36:01,482 --> 00:36:03,785
Yeah. Well, people started
paying attention.

616
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:05,854
So they changed the name
to UAPs.

617
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,355
And no one knows
what the fuck a UAP is,

618
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:09,891
so everyone lost interest.

619
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:12,226
I saw that.. That Navy clip.

620
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:13,595
Couldn't really see 'em, though.

621
00:36:13,628 --> 00:36:14,863
Could've been better.

622
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:17,832
It's shitty footage
of exact proof

623
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,668
that there's
an alien civilization

624
00:36:19,701 --> 00:36:21,503
out there in the universe.

625
00:36:21,536 --> 00:36:23,705
So, who's that?

626
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,741
Come on, man. The little guys
with the big eyes.

627
00:36:26,775 --> 00:36:27,909
- Mm.
- Yeah.

628
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:29,611
There's lots of theories.

629
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:32,580
Either they're intergalactic
travelers looking for peace

630
00:36:32,614 --> 00:36:35,950
or futuristic humans
coming back in time

631
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:38,252
to stop us
from destroying the planet,

632
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:41,589
or they're fucking
world killers.

633
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:43,290
Planetary destroyers.

634
00:36:43,323 --> 00:36:45,660
And that means that they've
been fucking watching us

635
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:48,730
and studying us, waiting for
the perfect time to beam us up

636
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:51,666
and shove metal probes
up our fucking asses.

637
00:36:54,435 --> 00:36:55,436
Cool.

638
00:36:55,469 --> 00:36:58,372
An-Anyway, <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
History Channel.

639
00:36:58,405 --> 00:37:00,542
- Watch that shit.
- Hey!

640
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,309
Hey!

641
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:04,612
Come on! Help a nigga out!

642
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,789
Hey.

643
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:17,726
Know where I could find me
a couple of big, strong fellas?

644
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,994
You good?

645
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,462
I'm good.

646
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:23,798
- What?
- What's that?

647
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:26,534
Oh, this?

648
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:28,770
You know, just, uh,
training horses we ordered

649
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,337
that I picked up.

650
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,473
- Where'd you get it from?
- Don't worry about it.

651
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:34,509
Now, come on, help me out.

652
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,878
Got you.

653
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:39,013
Okay, so... so what is that?

654
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:41,049
- Is it like bait?
- I told you.

655
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:43,350
It is a decoy
for horse training.

656
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:44,786
Okay.

657
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:47,922
Shit. Shit.

658
00:37:47,956 --> 00:37:49,591
- See?
- OJ.

659
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:52,026
We good.
I mean, he don't know shit.

660
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,629
Oh, no. You guys are doing
something shady.

661
00:37:58,032 --> 00:37:59,801
Hey there!

662
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,435
Hey!

663
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,838
You can stay right there,
though!

664
00:38:03,872 --> 00:38:05,907
Sure!

665
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,341
What's up?

666
00:38:07,374 --> 00:38:09,010
We're setting up a decoy!

667
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:11,813
For horse training!

668
00:38:11,846 --> 00:38:14,348
Oh, good!

669
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:16,383
You know, we got some of those!

670
00:38:19,087 --> 00:38:20,789
Where'd you get...

671
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,490
Where'd you get yours?!

672
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:27,095
Yeah... I'm not really sure!

673
00:38:27,128 --> 00:38:29,564
My wife would know!

674
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,901
- Okay! Thanks for stopping by!
- Why the... Shh.

675
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,368
You don't live here.

676
00:38:34,401 --> 00:38:35,804
Sorry. Trying to help.

677
00:38:35,837 --> 00:38:37,639
Sure thing!

678
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:41,843
Hey. I wanted
to invite you to our...

679
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:43,945
new family live show!

680
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:46,681
Friday! At 5:00 p.m.!

681
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:48,382
Okay!

682
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:52,921
Thumbs u... thumbs up.

683
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:54,689
Should I do it?

684
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:56,456
Yeah, do it.

685
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:58,860
Thumbs up!

686
00:38:59,727 --> 00:39:01,796
And so,
the router's in the shed.

687
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,866
I set it up so if the power
goes down on camera A,

688
00:39:04,899 --> 00:39:07,467
camera B's pointed
at the sky to catch

689
00:39:07,502 --> 00:39:09,070
whatever might have
taken it out.

690
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,706
And, uh, vice versa, so...

691
00:39:11,739 --> 00:39:13,608
Thank you.

692
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:16,053
I mean, you're really
not gonna tell me

693
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:17,444
what the fuck is going on?

694
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:20,724
- You'll know soon enough.
- Oh.

695
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:22,650
Cool, cryptic.

696
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:24,752
Fucking dicks.

697
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:29,123
I can monitor the feeds
remotely myself, if you want.

698
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:30,124
Free of charge.

699
00:39:30,158 --> 00:39:32,359
- Hell no.
- No.

700
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:35,005
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

701
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,666
One more thing.

702
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,869
You'll be getting a call
from my supervisor

703
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:41,942
asking how my service was.

704
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,838
Five stars, Angel. Five stars.

705
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,973
Thank you.

706
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:53,514
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

707
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:55,492
- What you want to do?
- I'm.. Whatever you want to do.

708
00:39:55,516 --> 00:39:57,051
Well, I got some work
I got to do.

709
00:39:57,085 --> 00:39:59,020
I'm gonna go out...

710
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:00,521
That's a good one.

711
00:40:22,543 --> 00:40:24,612
I'm talking
today to women who say

712
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:27,048
they have been abducted
by aliens from another planet.

713
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:29,550
May I briefly
say, I don't know for a fact

714
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:30,728
that they're from
another planet.

715
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:32,120
Well, you know you weren't

716
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:34,188
in Kansas anymore, Toto.

717
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:35,790
And I wasn't wearing red shoes

718
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:37,926
- that I could click together, either.
- Yeah, yeah.

719
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,053
Nope. Mm-mm. Nope, I'm out.

720
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,954
I'm going. Fuck this shit.

721
00:42:50,324 --> 00:42:53,094
Okay. Okay.

722
00:43:26,794 --> 00:43:27,794
Ow.

723
00:43:30,264 --> 00:43:32,266
- Oh, shit!
- Fuck off.

724
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,378
Give us back our property.

725
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:36,671
- Don't mess with Jupiter's Claim!
- Come on.

726
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,643
What happened?

727
00:43:42,677 --> 00:43:44,178
The Park kids.

728
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:45,746
Jupe's sons.

729
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,315
And they let Clover out, man.

730
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:49,717
What?
They trying to prank Haywood?

731
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:52,253
- It's on!
- Hey. You stole their horse.

732
00:43:52,286 --> 00:43:53,821
Oh.

733
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:55,022
Yeah.

734
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:25,920
- Hey.
- Shit.

735
00:44:25,953 --> 00:44:27,455
Oh.

736
00:44:27,488 --> 00:44:29,157
What's up, Nessie?

737
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,791
Not much. Just stocking shit.

738
00:44:30,825 --> 00:44:32,894
You know, pretty much regular.

739
00:45:03,024 --> 00:45:04,959
Oh, shit!

740
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:19,140
I need to take my ass to bed.

741
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,347
- Who this?
- Yo, it's Angel from Fry's.

742
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,083
Just calling to tell you that
there is a bug on camera A.

743
00:45:29,116 --> 00:45:31,852
I know. Wait, I thought I
told you not to watch our shit.

744
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah, I know, I know.

745
00:45:33,154 --> 00:45:34,455
Camera B is down.

746
00:45:34,488 --> 00:45:36,224
What?

747
00:45:36,257 --> 00:45:38,025
Camera B is down.

748
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:40,995
Like <i>Ancient-fucking-Aliens</i>
down.

749
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:56,203
- Hey!
- Hey. Hi.

750
00:46:56,237 --> 00:46:59,106
Emerald, can you please get
the bug off the thing?

751
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,778
Get the bug off
the fucking thing!

752
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:05,846
Shit.

753
00:47:15,156 --> 00:47:17,224
Um, what do you see?

754
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:19,460
Do you... do you see, like,
lights or anything?

755
00:47:19,494 --> 00:47:21,896
Like, a-a fucking saucer?

756
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:24,865
It's in the cloud.
It's in the cloud.

757
00:47:24,899 --> 00:47:27,301
OJ! It's in the cloud!

758
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:30,938
Mm-hmm.

759
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,480
Yeah, nah, nah, nah.

760
00:47:39,514 --> 00:47:42,116
Run, OJ! Run!

761
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,891
Shit.

762
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:32,433
Hello?

763
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:37,204
What happened to OJ?

764
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:40,341
It's fine.

765
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:42,042
Come on.

766
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:46,715
Okay, it's still on.

767
00:48:46,748 --> 00:48:49,116
The camera, it's still on.

768
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:04,031
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

769
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:08,302
Okay, you fucking
praying mantis.

770
00:49:08,335 --> 00:49:09,571
All right, bitch.

771
00:49:09,604 --> 00:49:11,372
You like Sour Patch Kids?

772
00:49:11,405 --> 00:49:12,940
Huh?

773
00:50:34,421 --> 00:50:36,491
A'ight, man.

774
00:50:36,525 --> 00:50:39,226
Where your shit? Let's go.

775
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,795
Haven't seen one of those
in a minute.

776
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,429
Fucking praying mantis.

777
00:50:42,463 --> 00:50:44,174
That motherfucker better pray
I don't ever see him,

778
00:50:44,198 --> 00:50:46,400
'cause if I do, I'm-a eat him.

779
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:49,136
- Let's go.
- Where?

780
00:50:49,169 --> 00:50:50,539
Man, I don't know.

781
00:50:50,572 --> 00:50:52,541
I got me
a little situation in At water

782
00:50:52,574 --> 00:50:54,141
texting me back right now.

783
00:50:54,174 --> 00:50:57,278
- It's not coming again tonight.
- I don't care.

784
00:50:57,311 --> 00:50:59,413
No. No.

785
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:01,382
No.

786
00:51:01,415 --> 00:51:05,687
Bro, I ain't never seen
no shit like this.

787
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,187
It ain't worth it.

788
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,558
No, nope. It's too much.

789
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:12,159
You should go, then.

790
00:51:12,192 --> 00:51:14,461
I got to get up early anyway.

791
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:19,066
I got mouths to feed.

792
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,346
Shit.

793
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:35,650
Shit, shit, shit!

794
00:51:55,169 --> 00:51:57,104
You hear that?

795
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:06,514
Ghost out there.

796
00:52:08,382 --> 00:52:11,285
Acting all territorial.

797
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:15,456
Mm.

798
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:20,260
I guess some animals
ain't fit to be trained.

799
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:42,383
- Hello?
- Uh, hi.

800
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,719
Is this, uh, Antlers Holst?

801
00:52:46,253 --> 00:52:47,522
Who's this?

802
00:52:47,555 --> 00:52:49,456
Hey, yeah. I'm Emerald Haywood.

803
00:52:49,491 --> 00:52:52,393
Uh, we met a couple days ago
at the commercial.

804
00:52:52,426 --> 00:52:55,195
Oh, yeah, horse girl. Sure.

805
00:52:55,229 --> 00:52:57,264
I remember you and your brother.

806
00:52:57,297 --> 00:52:59,266
Yeah, horse boy.

807
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:00,869
He's here, too.

808
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,705
- The descendants of the jockey.
- Yeah.

809
00:53:03,738 --> 00:53:07,542
Guess I'm talking to
motion picture royalty, then.

810
00:53:08,943 --> 00:53:10,477
How'd you get the number?

811
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:12,847
- I got it from the call sheet.
- Ah.

812
00:53:12,881 --> 00:53:14,949
So, we have a project, and, uh,

813
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:18,452
you know, what if I told you
it was the offer of a lifetime?

814
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:21,422
Yeah, hopefully not my lifetime.

815
00:53:21,455 --> 00:53:23,825
That's a good one.
Um, I'm-a be real with you.

816
00:53:23,858 --> 00:53:26,427
We don't have a lot of money
to pay you up front..

817
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,296
You know, not like
you're used to.. But, uh...

818
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:32,834
Yeah. I tend to do one for them
so I can do one for me,

819
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,904
so what is it?

820
00:53:35,937 --> 00:53:38,773
- Reality.
- Oh, no. Reality.

821
00:53:38,807 --> 00:53:40,508
Documentary.

822
00:53:41,442 --> 00:53:44,478
- Doc-Documentary.
- Oh, that's better.

823
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:48,016
So, again, what's it about?

824
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:51,218
It's about the shit
dreams is made of, baby.

825
00:53:51,886 --> 00:53:53,888
Listen, horse girl.

826
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:56,725
I got a, uh...

827
00:53:56,758 --> 00:54:00,360
...pretty damn superb
lemon tart in the oven

828
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:03,397
I'm about to serve to ten
of my closest friends, so...

829
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,799
Stop.

830
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:07,502
- Stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, hold on one second. What?

831
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,013
- He's not here for that.
- Look, look, no.

832
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,648
Don't be cute.
Stick to the plan. Say it!

833
00:54:10,672 --> 00:54:12,449
This is what I do.
I don't go to your job

834
00:54:12,473 --> 00:54:14,018
and knock a horse's dick
out your damn hand.

835
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:15,385
- Hello?
- Yeah.

836
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:16,754
Yeah, my bad. We good, man.

837
00:54:16,778 --> 00:54:21,049
Um, according to
<i>American Cinema</i> magazine,

838
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:25,553
you make the cinematically
impossible possible.

839
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:28,923
Well, we looking
for the impossible shot.

840
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,896
That's impossible.

841
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:36,531
Antlers.

842
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,900
There's something out here
in Agua Dulce,

843
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:41,301
and you're probably
the only person in the world

844
00:54:41,335 --> 00:54:43,738
that can get it on film.

845
00:54:43,772 --> 00:54:45,673
Th-That's it.

846
00:54:46,641 --> 00:54:51,478
Horse girl,
this dream you're chasing,

847
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:55,315
the one where you end up
at the top of the mountain,

848
00:54:55,349 --> 00:54:57,852
all eyes on you...

849
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:03,423
...it's the dream
you never wake up from.

850
00:55:17,005 --> 00:55:18,506
I don't like him.

851
00:55:42,497 --> 00:55:44,666
Holy shit. It's real.

852
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,937
I don't know
what you're doing here, but...

853
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,706
it was illegal for you to...

854
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:53,608
spy on us like that.

855
00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:02,750
Wait, you... you don't know?

856
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:07,487
Okay, uh, tell me
when you see it.

857
00:56:17,031 --> 00:56:18,766
There.

858
00:56:19,634 --> 00:56:22,670
- Doesn't move.
- Exactly.

859
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,841
Well, look at that.

860
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:30,912
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

861
00:56:30,945 --> 00:56:33,081
I went back and scrubbed
through the footage,

862
00:56:33,114 --> 00:56:35,149
and that cloud
has been right there

863
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,751
at least since
I set the cameras up.

864
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:38,485
Yeah, now you mention it,

865
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,588
I've probably been looking
at the same damn cloud

866
00:56:40,622 --> 00:56:42,757
every day
for the last six months.

867
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,792
Shit.

868
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:46,761
So, I mean,
that's them in there.

869
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:49,097
And we've been recording it,
so we got it.

870
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,865
Right?

871
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,635
Yeah.

872
00:56:54,468 --> 00:56:56,938
Why you saying "yeah" like that?

873
00:56:56,971 --> 00:56:59,574
I mean, we have proof
of aliens on video. I...

874
00:56:59,607 --> 00:57:01,509
Yeah, I wouldn't call it proof.

875
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:03,011
Are you serious?

876
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,089
Look, I've seen crazy weather
phenomenons online before.

877
00:57:05,113 --> 00:57:07,715
- That's all I'm saying.
- He's right.

878
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:10,785
It's good, but it ain't it.
Ain't <i>Oprah.</i>

879
00:57:12,153 --> 00:57:13,955
Ain't <i>Oprah.</i>

880
00:57:15,823 --> 00:57:20,161
Okay. Are you guys telling me

881
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:23,531
that there's an alien spaceship

882
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:25,566
in that fucking cloud
right there?

883
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,969
It doesn't move like a ship.

884
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,572
What you mean, OJ?

885
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:36,577
What if it's not a ship?

886
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:42,760
<i>All right, Gordy,
we're almost ready, buddy.</i>

887
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:45,186
Here we go, buddy. Come on.

888
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:47,188
- He's ready.
- Set.

889
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,090
Here we go.

890
00:57:49,123 --> 00:57:50,625
And... action.

891
00:57:50,658 --> 00:57:52,102
And, of course,
I set it to Icelandic time

892
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:55,530
because we share a love
of the aurora borealis, Gordy.

893
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:59,233
And you have no idea
how to tell time.

894
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,536
Great gift, Dad.

895
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:02,971
Way to think things through.

896
00:58:03,004 --> 00:58:04,872
Somehow, you'd think
that a man who can send

897
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:07,508
a rocket into space
would be able to manage

898
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:09,711
a halfway decent
birthday present.

899
00:58:09,744 --> 00:58:11,012
Nope.

900
00:58:13,581 --> 00:58:16,551
You know, Gordy,
all things considered,

901
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:18,886
maybe my gift
isn't so bad after all.

902
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,254
- Aw.
- Aw.

903
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,657
Hey, Gordy.

904
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,625
- Surprise!
- Wow.

905
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:27,762
Now, that is a gift.

906
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,938
Oh. Sorry. My...

907
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,273
That's all right.
Pick it up from there.

908
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,942
Wait a minute.

909
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:44,112
What happened to we both failed
at finding good presents?

910
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:50,818
Here you go, Gordy.
Happy birthday.

911
00:58:51,786 --> 00:58:54,756
Oh, beautiful, Hayley.

912
00:59:01,662 --> 00:59:03,073
<i>Whoa, hey, hey, hey. No.</i>

913
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:05,333
<i>- No, no! Down! Down! Gordy!
- Down!</i>

914
00:59:05,366 --> 00:59:07,035
<i>- No. Stop!
- Stop that!</i>

915
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,998
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

916
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:46,734
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Gordy, no! No!

917
01:00:46,767 --> 01:00:48,412
D-D-Down! Down! Down!

918
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,238
You sit! Down.

919
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,739
No, no, no.

920
01:00:53,975 --> 01:00:55,943
No, no, no!

921
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:58,980
No, Gordy!

922
01:00:59,013 --> 01:01:00,148
Stop! Ah!

923
01:01:00,181 --> 01:01:02,717
No! No!

924
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:04,305
Seven just on scene..
Oh, my God.

925
01:03:56,157 --> 01:03:57,559
Feeling good?

926
01:03:57,592 --> 01:03:59,327
Yeah.

927
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,495
Feeling good.

928
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:02,363
Good.

929
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:09,303
There we go.

930
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:14,375
Run it.
Run it one more time, babe.

931
01:04:14,408 --> 01:04:15,910
Okay.

932
01:04:22,383 --> 01:04:24,852
What if I told you...

933
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:41,268
Yo. It's, uh... Storm's coming.

934
01:04:42,136 --> 01:04:45,039
Just tarping up,
just to be safe.

935
01:05:03,324 --> 01:05:06,026
Hey, where you going?

936
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,129
I'm-a get Lucky.

937
01:05:08,162 --> 01:05:10,131
<i>Now, we're not gonna let</i>

938
01:05:10,164 --> 01:05:13,033
a few clouds kill our fun
today, are we, folks?

939
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:15,102
So, without further ado,

940
01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:19,073
welcome to the Jupiter's Claim
Star Lasso Experience!

941
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:24,345
How's everyone feeling today?

942
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:27,148
All right.

943
01:05:27,181 --> 01:05:30,151
It's quite a doozy today.

944
01:05:30,184 --> 01:05:32,721
Uh, I want to thank you guys
for coming out here.

945
01:05:32,754 --> 01:05:35,389
But first, how about
another round of applause

946
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:37,158
for my Amber?

947
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:39,093
I'll tell you, that woman is

948
01:05:39,126 --> 01:05:42,229
a saint for putting up
with all my craziness.

949
01:05:42,263 --> 01:05:44,198
And to the knuckleheads
up there.

950
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,334
The staff. Shout-out.

951
01:05:47,368 --> 01:05:48,469
All right, all right.

952
01:05:48,503 --> 01:05:50,137
That's enough.

953
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:53,407
I also want to give
a special thanks to

954
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:57,011
an old costar of mine
and my first crush,

955
01:05:57,044 --> 01:05:58,713
Mary Jo Elliott, everyone!

956
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,549
Yeah.

957
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:06,020
All right.

958
01:06:07,021 --> 01:06:09,156
You ready?

959
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,333
Oh, come on.
That ain't nothing.

960
01:06:10,357 --> 01:06:12,561
Are you ready?!

961
01:06:16,363 --> 01:06:18,032
Here we go.

962
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,107
You're chosen.

963
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,720
What if I told you...

964
01:06:38,753 --> 01:06:41,690
that in about an hour...

965
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:45,092
you'll leave here different?

966
01:06:46,227 --> 01:06:51,131
See, every Friday
for the last six months,

967
01:06:51,165 --> 01:06:54,703
my family and I
have bore witness

968
01:06:54,736 --> 01:06:58,272
to an absolute spectacle.

969
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:02,142
One that you'll be
seeing here today.

970
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:06,380
So let me take you back
to that first night.

971
01:07:15,256 --> 01:07:19,126
Right here in this exact spot,

972
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:23,264
I'd come over to wrangle
a chestnut horse named Trigger.

973
01:07:23,297 --> 01:07:26,768
Now, I could barely see my hand
in front of my face

974
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:30,337
for the fog, but I swear

975
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:33,808
on my wife and children's lives

976
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:37,311
that at 6:13 p.m.,

977
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:39,146
I see...

978
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:42,551
...a flying saucer

979
01:07:42,584 --> 01:07:45,286
descend through the mist.

980
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:49,356
Old Trigger took off
straight into the gulch.

981
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:50,592
And, well...

982
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:54,128
...it's like he was going home.

983
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:04,104
Now, just to be clear,
what we saw

984
01:08:04,138 --> 01:08:06,440
was a flying saucer.

985
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:07,709
No doubt about that.

986
01:08:07,742 --> 01:08:09,209
Slightly flatter in the front,

987
01:08:09,243 --> 01:08:10,845
with a circular hole
in the bottom

988
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,782
about two school bus
lengths wide.

989
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:16,618
Ladies and gentlemen,
I kid you not.

990
01:08:18,753 --> 01:08:20,589
We are being surveilled

991
01:08:20,622 --> 01:08:24,391
by an alien species
I call "the Viewers."

992
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,128
And though they have yet
to emerge from their ship,

993
01:08:28,162 --> 01:08:30,865
I believe they trust me.

994
01:08:30,899 --> 01:08:33,501
If they didn't,
I don't think any of us

995
01:08:33,535 --> 01:08:34,769
would be here right now.

996
01:08:36,805 --> 01:08:41,576
So, as I said,
in just under an hour,

997
01:08:41,610 --> 01:08:46,681
Star Lasso Experience
is gonna change you.

998
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:50,317
But first,
my boys are gonna come out

999
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:52,587
and do a little number for us.
Would that be all right?

1000
01:08:52,621 --> 01:08:54,498
Hustle. Go, go, go.- -

1001
01:08:54,522 --> 01:08:56,223
All right.
My little satellites:

1002
01:08:56,256 --> 01:08:57,935
Colton, Phoenix, Max.

1003
01:08:57,959 --> 01:08:59,728
Remember those names, folks.

1004
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,261
All right, here we go!

1005
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:13,307
What is that?

1006
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,476
Do you guys see that?

1007
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:32,459
Uh, uh, stay in your seats.

1008
01:09:32,494 --> 01:09:34,294
This is new.

1009
01:09:34,328 --> 01:09:36,463
Uh, they're early.

1010
01:09:36,498 --> 01:09:38,667
They're giving us
a real show today.

1011
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,310
- That they are.
- Yeah.

1012
01:09:40,334 --> 01:09:41,870
They're giving us
a real show today.

1013
01:09:41,903 --> 01:09:44,271
They're ready, we're ready.

1014
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,943
Welcome
to the Star Lasso Experience,

1015
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:51,579
only at Jupiter's Claim.

1016
01:09:51,613 --> 01:09:53,615
- Please remember to avoid...
- Come on.

1017
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,458
...using your cell phones
or any flash photography...

1018
01:09:55,482 --> 01:09:57,819
- Cell phones off, y'all.
- ...during the event.

1019
01:09:57,852 --> 01:09:59,286
Come on!

1020
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:00,588
Bear with us now.

1021
01:10:00,622 --> 01:10:02,924
Trained animals
can be unpredictable.

1022
01:10:08,697 --> 01:10:13,300
Now sit back,
stay in your seats and enjoy

1023
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:17,237
The Star Lasso Experien...

1024
01:11:45,827 --> 01:11:48,362
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

1025
01:11:48,395 --> 01:11:50,799
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1026
01:11:50,832 --> 01:11:53,400
That's right. Happy trails.

1027
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:55,335
It's closing time.

1028
01:11:55,369 --> 01:11:58,039
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1029
01:11:58,072 --> 01:11:59,674
Come back again.

1030
01:11:59,707 --> 01:12:02,911
And until then,
we wish you well.

1031
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:05,713
Hasta la vista. Adios.

1032
01:12:22,429 --> 01:12:24,766
Well, cowboys and cowgirls,

1033
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,101
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1034
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,904
That's right. Happy trails.

1035
01:12:29,938 --> 01:12:31,673
It's closing time.

1036
01:12:31,706 --> 01:12:34,742
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1037
01:12:34,776 --> 01:12:36,110
Come back again.

1038
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:37,745
And until then...

1039
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,574
Lucky.

1040
01:13:47,815 --> 01:13:48,917
Lucky.

1041
01:13:53,621 --> 01:13:55,690
Lucky, come on, come on.
Come on!

1042
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,542
Come on, come on, come on.

1043
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:16,878
Lucky.

1044
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:29,223
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1045
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:16,170
Yo.

1046
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:17,939
It's done.

1047
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,950
All right, I'll be over in the
morning to tear that shit off.

1048
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,251
Or you guys can do it
yourselves.

1049
01:15:21,275 --> 01:15:22,810
- It's all the same.
- No, no.

1050
01:15:22,844 --> 01:15:25,213
- I like when you do it.
- Of course you do.

1051
01:15:25,246 --> 01:15:27,548
All right. See you tomorrow.

1052
01:15:27,582 --> 01:15:29,250
See you.

1053
01:15:34,956 --> 01:15:37,125
Pick up, pick up, pick up,

1054
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,593
pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

1055
01:15:38,626 --> 01:15:41,562
Come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

1056
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:56,911
Did you know that

1057
01:15:56,944 --> 01:15:58,713
the very first assembly
of photographs

1058
01:15:58,746 --> 01:16:00,748
in sequential order
to make a motion picture

1059
01:16:00,782 --> 01:16:02,884
was a two-second clip
of a Black man on a horse?

1060
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:05,186
That man was a Bahamian jockey

1061
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:06,988
known as Alistair E. Haywood,

1062
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:09,190
and he was
my great-great-grandfather.

1063
01:16:09,223 --> 01:16:10,658
- Hey.
- Em.

1064
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,160
I was right.

1065
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,961
It's not a ship.

1066
01:16:13,995 --> 01:16:15,329
What happened?

1067
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,673
What the fuck?

1068
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:40,755
Shit.

1069
01:16:43,191 --> 01:16:44,959
It ate them, Em.

1070
01:16:44,992 --> 01:16:46,360
It ate them all.

1071
01:16:46,394 --> 01:16:48,129
It's alive, Em. It's an animal.

1072
01:16:48,162 --> 01:16:49,831
It's territorial, and it thinks

1073
01:16:49,864 --> 01:16:54,068
That this is its home.

1074
01:16:55,436 --> 01:16:57,839
Em!

1075
01:17:02,677 --> 01:17:05,046
Oh, fuck.

1076
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,115
Oh, shit.

1077
01:17:07,148 --> 01:17:08,749
Ooh, yes.

1078
01:17:10,351 --> 01:17:12,253
Hey, hey. We're in trouble.

1079
01:17:12,286 --> 01:17:14,088
Okay?

1080
01:17:14,122 --> 01:17:16,057
Oh, fuck.

1081
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,725
Shit.

1082
01:17:24,899 --> 01:17:26,100
What?

1083
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,658
What the fuck?

1084
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:52,693
What the fuck?

1085
01:17:55,062 --> 01:17:57,064
Who the hell is that?

1086
01:17:58,332 --> 01:17:59,934
Who the hell is that?

1087
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:03,804
- Em! Who the hell is that?
- Fuck.

1088
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:09,710
It's above us.

1089
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,684
Ah, shit!

1090
01:18:19,954 --> 01:18:21,088
Shit.

1091
01:18:21,122 --> 01:18:23,991
Oh, shit! What the fuck?

1092
01:18:43,778 --> 01:18:46,147
Oh, God.

1093
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,916
S-Something very bad
is happening.

1094
01:19:00,995 --> 01:19:02,096
Fuck!

1095
01:19:18,846 --> 01:19:20,381
Yeah, we're fucked.

1096
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:32,113
Nope.

1097
01:23:40,274 --> 01:23:42,109
Em. OJ's coming.

1098
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:43,377
Let's go.

1099
01:23:43,410 --> 01:23:45,246
Got to get out this house.

1100
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:47,248
I got to get out this house.

1101
01:23:47,281 --> 01:23:49,116
No, st-st-stop.
Can't we just wait, right?

1102
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:50,828
- You can.
- No, I'm not gonna be here alone.

1103
01:23:50,852 --> 01:23:52,721
- I've got to get out this fucking house!
- No.

1104
01:23:52,754 --> 01:23:54,354
We're alive still
because we stayed here.

1105
01:25:05,627 --> 01:25:06,895
Go!

1106
01:25:06,928 --> 01:25:09,430
- Come on. Come on.
- Go!

1107
01:25:10,297 --> 01:25:11,542
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1108
01:25:11,566 --> 01:25:14,134
Come on, come on.

1109
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:23,243
Go.

1110
01:25:26,915 --> 01:25:29,149
Yeah, she... she gonna make it.

1111
01:25:29,183 --> 01:25:30,552
- OJ.
- She gonna make it.

1112
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:32,329
- Oh, hey, horsie.
- Hey, don't-don't look him

1113
01:25:32,353 --> 01:25:34,856
- in the eyes, please.
- VFX!

1114
01:25:48,402 --> 01:25:50,705
Focus here. Focus here.

1115
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:52,373
Come on.

1116
01:26:16,631 --> 01:26:18,800
Welcome to my tavern.

1117
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:22,403
I don't know if you've heard,
but a terrible beast is about.

1118
01:26:22,436 --> 01:26:24,304
It's been harassing villagers,

1119
01:26:24,338 --> 01:26:26,908
ruining crops
and eating their livestock.

1120
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:35,717
Many a glory-seeking hunter
has attempted to defeat it,

1121
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:38,520
and just as many have perished.

1122
01:26:38,553 --> 01:26:40,989
While you're here...
While you're here...

1123
01:26:41,022 --> 01:26:43,558
While you're here,
please look around.

1124
01:26:46,995 --> 01:26:49,329
I'm here in
Agua Dulce, California,

1125
01:26:49,363 --> 01:26:51,700
and the whereabouts of
those 40 guests and employees

1126
01:26:51,733 --> 01:26:54,502
of a local Western theme park
are still unknown.

1127
01:26:54,536 --> 01:26:57,271
The sheriff's office
has had its hands full

1128
01:26:57,304 --> 01:26:59,373
trying to identify
the unaccounted for.

1129
01:26:59,406 --> 01:27:01,876
Until they do,
only one thing is certain.

1130
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,645
There is something strange
happening

1131
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:04,813
out here in Agua Dulce.

1132
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:06,857
Security
cameras were off at the time.

1133
01:27:06,881 --> 01:27:10,018
Other than that, we have, uh,
no reason to suspect foul play.

1134
01:27:10,051 --> 01:27:11,686
We did have
a considerable amount

1135
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:12,987
of rain come through here,

1136
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:15,724
so we don't want to rule out
flash flooding

1137
01:27:15,757 --> 01:27:18,727
as possibly having played
a part. We're obviously...

1138
01:27:22,329 --> 01:27:25,600
You never go wrong
with a fried fish sandwich.

1139
01:27:28,435 --> 01:27:30,672
Tartar got tang.

1140
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,008
Stupid.

1141
01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:35,777
"Tartar got tang"?

1142
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:37,912
Right?

1143
01:27:37,946 --> 01:27:41,783
I don't think it eats you if
you don't look it in the eye.

1144
01:27:45,352 --> 01:27:46,630
Hey, hey!

1145
01:27:46,654 --> 01:27:49,023
RTR, bro.

1146
01:27:49,057 --> 01:27:51,258
You know?

1147
01:27:52,026 --> 01:27:54,562
Like, read the room.

1148
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,668
Nobody want to talk about that.

1149
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:03,714
- Let's go!
- Okay, okay, okay. Enough.

1150
01:28:03,738 --> 01:28:05,516
All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

1151
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,942
Hey, you lucky!

1152
01:28:07,976 --> 01:28:09,911
<i>Every animal got rules.</i>

1153
01:28:09,944 --> 01:28:11,813
All right?
We know what it wants,

1154
01:28:11,846 --> 01:28:13,681
and we know how it comes, so...

1155
01:28:13,715 --> 01:28:15,382
Fuck.

1156
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:17,719
We don't really know shit.

1157
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:21,523
OJ, what's this about, man?

1158
01:28:21,556 --> 01:28:23,323
What's this about?
You want me to...

1159
01:28:23,357 --> 01:28:25,894
You want me to say, "I'm sorry"?

1160
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:27,662
"I was wrong"? "It's dumb"?

1161
01:28:27,695 --> 01:28:28,997
It wasn't dumb.

1162
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:30,598
- Own the moment.
- Stop.

1163
01:28:30,632 --> 01:28:32,576
- Stop, stop this shit.
- It was good. It was good.

1164
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,702
But the moment about to pass.

1165
01:28:34,736 --> 01:28:36,571
And we don't own shit.

1166
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:44,078
Okay. Well, I assume
y'all are crashing at mine.

1167
01:28:44,112 --> 01:28:46,080
Right, 'cause you can.

1168
01:28:46,114 --> 01:28:47,816
'Cause I'm not going back

1169
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:50,118
to the fucking monster umbrella.

1170
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:52,954
Got to feed 'em.

1171
01:28:52,987 --> 01:28:55,322
Let Lucky out.

1172
01:28:56,524 --> 01:28:58,092
There's shit to do.

1173
01:28:58,126 --> 01:28:59,861
Always.

1174
01:29:00,895 --> 01:29:02,864
Always some shit to do.

1175
01:29:49,777 --> 01:29:53,081
There's a wheelchair
on your roof.

1176
01:29:53,114 --> 01:29:54,749
Hi.

1177
01:29:54,782 --> 01:29:58,485
That cloud ain't moved
a goddamn inch.

1178
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,421
So you're not completely
full of shit.

1179
01:30:02,056 --> 01:30:03,124
Thank you.

1180
01:30:03,157 --> 01:30:04,859
Yeah. Thank you.

1181
01:30:04,893 --> 01:30:07,695
Th-The concept
of extraterrestrial animals

1182
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:09,697
in the sky is not a new thing.

1183
01:30:09,731 --> 01:30:11,499
You know, people been trying

1184
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:13,043
to get pictures of these things
since, like, the '50s.

1185
01:30:13,067 --> 01:30:15,027
- You know, it's an ancient...
- How do we see it?

1186
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:18,172
It's gonna get hungry again.

1187
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:19,908
Ah.

1188
01:30:19,941 --> 01:30:21,910
So, you know...

1189
01:30:21,943 --> 01:30:23,912
just ring the dinner bell.

1190
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:31,819
Now, we know
what it doesn't like.

1191
01:30:31,853 --> 01:30:35,023
That little fake horse
and flags messed it up good.

1192
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,826
Got stuck in its windpipe
or something.

1193
01:30:39,894 --> 01:30:42,931
I bet it ain't gonna fuck with
flags like that in a minute.

1194
01:30:42,964 --> 01:30:44,832
Yeah.

1195
01:30:44,866 --> 01:30:46,466
We pissed him off.

1196
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:49,170
We're not the reason
it settled down here.

1197
01:30:49,203 --> 01:30:50,805
That was Jupe.

1198
01:30:50,838 --> 01:30:53,107
He got caught up
trying to tame a predator.

1199
01:30:53,141 --> 01:30:54,609
You can't do that.

1200
01:30:54,642 --> 01:30:56,544
You got to enter an agreement
with one.

1201
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:57,979
Yeah.

1202
01:30:58,012 --> 01:30:59,847
Ask Siegfried and Roy.

1203
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,718
Okay.

1204
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:06,955
Um, asking as someone
who was in the house

1205
01:31:06,988 --> 01:31:09,924
- when the shit went down...
- Mm.

1206
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:13,995
How exactly do you enter
an agreement with a fucking...

1207
01:31:14,028 --> 01:31:17,498
a UFO, alien entity or whatever
the hell you want to call it?

1208
01:31:17,532 --> 01:31:19,500
Jean Jacket.

1209
01:31:19,534 --> 01:31:21,135
Call him Jean Jacket.

1210
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:22,737
So, how about this?

1211
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:25,506
How about we send
ol' Jean Jacket

1212
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:27,241
some fresh horses in golden hour

1213
01:31:27,275 --> 01:31:29,610
- and see what happens?
- Mm-mm.

1214
01:31:30,244 --> 01:31:32,113
Horse people.

1215
01:31:32,146 --> 01:31:34,115
Mm, why not just set them free?

1216
01:31:34,148 --> 01:31:35,717
We're not doing that.

1217
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,552
Okay.

1218
01:31:38,186 --> 01:31:41,856
Who is gonna go down there

1219
01:31:41,889 --> 01:31:44,859
and get the star
out of his trailer?

1220
01:31:47,128 --> 01:31:48,997
Me.

1221
01:31:49,964 --> 01:31:52,633
I'll get him out.

1222
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:55,670
Where you want it?

1223
01:31:55,703 --> 01:31:58,539
You draw him out there.

1224
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:01,542
I'm here.

1225
01:32:01,576 --> 01:32:03,644
On this ridge.

1226
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:06,514
Oh, shit.

1227
01:32:07,148 --> 01:32:08,616
Made her myself.

1228
01:32:08,649 --> 01:32:10,752
No electricity.

1229
01:32:10,785 --> 01:32:12,787
Didn't I tell you
this motherfucker was gonna

1230
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:15,156
come up here with
a non-electrical camera?

1231
01:32:15,189 --> 01:32:17,225
Let's go, boy!

1232
01:32:17,258 --> 01:32:18,726
Yeah!

1233
01:32:19,727 --> 01:32:21,996
I've been up under it
a couple times now.

1234
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:24,032
I get him.

1235
01:32:25,033 --> 01:32:26,801
<i>It's an animal.</i>

1236
01:32:26,834 --> 01:32:28,603
<i>You don't turn your back
on a bear.</i>

1237
01:32:28,636 --> 01:32:30,104
<i>You don't wear red
around a bull.</i>

1238
01:32:30,138 --> 01:32:31,839
<i>It's like that.</i>

1239
01:32:31,873 --> 01:32:35,743
<i>You don't look at it
unless you want its attention.</i>

1240
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:39,580
Good night, Mr. Store man.

1241
01:32:39,614 --> 01:32:41,883
Fuck it. I call top hat.

1242
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,685
<i>And we ain't got a lot of time.</i>

1243
01:32:46,087 --> 01:32:47,755
<i>One day. Two days, tops.</i>

1244
01:32:50,892 --> 01:32:54,629
<i>'Cause the word is getting out,
and when it does...</i>

1245
01:32:54,662 --> 01:32:57,632
Sorry, dead people.
Park's closed.

1246
01:32:57,665 --> 01:32:59,133
<i>...you know people gonna come</i>

1247
01:32:59,167 --> 01:33:01,669
<i>and do what they always do:</i>

1248
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:04,205
<i>Try and take it all
for themselves.</i>

1249
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:06,074
Fine.

1250
01:33:06,107 --> 01:33:07,675
Thimble.

1251
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:10,144
That's the one I wanted anyway.

1252
01:33:12,113 --> 01:33:14,682
<i>Well, let 'em come.</i>

1253
01:33:14,715 --> 01:33:16,384
<i>It ain't gonna matter.</i>

1254
01:33:18,986 --> 01:33:21,689
<i>'Cause what we about to do...</i>

1255
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:26,027
<i>...they can't erase that.</i>

1256
01:33:32,433 --> 01:33:35,736
He's big, he's bad,

1257
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,905
and he's got a lot of spirit.

1258
01:33:41,409 --> 01:33:43,978
But anything with a spirit
can get broke.

1259
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:48,749
So you break it.

1260
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,986
I'll get the shot.

1261
01:33:56,757 --> 01:33:58,626
<i>Hey, um...</i>

1262
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,396
What we're doing's important.

1263
01:34:02,430 --> 01:34:03,965
Right?

1264
01:34:03,998 --> 01:34:07,768
Like, what we document,
it's, uh...

1265
01:34:09,303 --> 01:34:12,039
...it's gonna do some good, huh?

1266
01:34:13,007 --> 01:34:17,778
I mean, besides the money
and fucking fame,

1267
01:34:17,812 --> 01:34:19,280
like, we can save some lives.

1268
01:34:19,313 --> 01:34:22,316
Fuck, we-we can even save Earth.

1269
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:24,051
Right?

1270
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:27,188
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1271
01:35:25,913 --> 01:35:29,016
<i>Sure looks strange to me.</i>

1272
01:35:44,432 --> 01:35:46,867
He ain't gonna fuck with you.

1273
01:36:26,575 --> 01:36:29,043
Time to wake up the family.

1274
01:36:45,126 --> 01:36:47,428
Here we go.

1275
01:36:47,461 --> 01:36:50,565
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1276
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:21,395
How exquisitely stupid is that?

1277
01:37:57,599 --> 01:37:59,568
Hah, hah, hah!

1278
01:38:05,239 --> 01:38:06,941
We gonna get you today,
motherfucker.

1279
01:38:21,690 --> 01:38:23,991
Where is the feed
for Holst's camera?

1280
01:38:24,024 --> 01:38:25,459
Over.

1281
01:38:25,494 --> 01:38:27,128
Couldn't figure it out. Over.

1282
01:38:27,161 --> 01:38:29,296
What you mean,
you couldn't figure it out?

1283
01:38:29,330 --> 01:38:30,965
Over.

1284
01:38:30,998 --> 01:38:34,268
Um, Holst is shooting
on a film camera,

1285
01:38:34,301 --> 01:38:37,204
and all of our cameras are
digital, so it's a whole thing.

1286
01:38:37,238 --> 01:38:38,239
Over.

1287
01:38:38,272 --> 01:38:41,610
Basically,
you forgot about it. Over.

1288
01:38:41,643 --> 01:38:43,377
Yeah, well, I had my hands full

1289
01:38:43,411 --> 01:38:45,556
rigging 50 fucking sky dancers
to dead people's car batteries

1290
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:46,691
all connected
to one control panel.

1291
01:38:46,715 --> 01:38:48,717
So, yeah, fucking over. Sorry.

1292
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,151
I'm scared.

1293
01:38:50,184 --> 01:38:51,986
Man down.

1294
01:38:52,019 --> 01:38:54,088
Man down? What? Where?

1295
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:56,691
Last dancer, deep in the gulch.

1296
01:38:56,725 --> 01:38:59,494
Stay on it, Em. I'm staying up.

1297
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,931
Motherfucker.

1298
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,308
Oh, wait, wait.

1299
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:16,043
Oh, it's back up.

1300
01:39:16,076 --> 01:39:18,212
Could be a faulty battery.

1301
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,316
All right. Shot's up, then.

1302
01:39:24,485 --> 01:39:26,420
Nah, he's poking.

1303
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:37,599
Who's this asshole?

1304
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,603
Man in black
on a white motorcycle.

1305
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:44,506
No, no, no, no, no, no. Shit.

1306
01:39:48,342 --> 01:39:50,244
Can I help you?

1307
01:39:58,118 --> 01:40:00,522
You see that cloud?

1308
01:40:01,656 --> 01:40:04,391
Hey, man, who you with?

1309
01:40:05,259 --> 01:40:06,795
Oh, I'm sorry.

1310
01:40:06,828 --> 01:40:08,462
Who are you?

1311
01:40:08,497 --> 01:40:10,397
Nobody.

1312
01:40:10,431 --> 01:40:13,400
You don't look like
a nobody to me.

1313
01:40:13,434 --> 01:40:15,537
Yeah, look, w-we doing
a camera test

1314
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:16,805
for a Verizon commercial,

1315
01:40:16,838 --> 01:40:18,507
so now I'm-a need you
to clear the road.

1316
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,675
This whole valley
comes up as blurry

1317
01:40:20,709 --> 01:40:22,409
on Google Maps.

1318
01:40:22,443 --> 01:40:25,145
You're really tucked away
back here.

1319
01:40:26,146 --> 01:40:27,549
Jupiter's Claim?

1320
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:30,484
Quicker if you go
the other way around.

1321
01:40:30,519 --> 01:40:32,419
Yeah.

1322
01:40:32,453 --> 01:40:34,523
Actually,

1323
01:40:34,556 --> 01:40:38,125
what did happen with Jupe Park
and all those people?

1324
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:39,828
He was basically
your neighbor, right?

1325
01:40:39,861 --> 01:40:41,395
So, what, they vanished?

1326
01:40:41,428 --> 01:40:43,765
You don't believe
the flood narrative, do you?

1327
01:40:43,798 --> 01:40:45,432
Fuck, guys.

1328
01:40:45,466 --> 01:40:47,134
It's <i>TMZ.</i>

1329
01:40:47,769 --> 01:40:49,236
Oh, fuck me.

1330
01:40:50,505 --> 01:40:54,475
Uh, hey, guys. Uh, Jean Jacket
is definitely in those clouds,

1331
01:40:54,509 --> 01:40:57,411
and he's definitely
coming this way.

1332
01:40:57,444 --> 01:40:59,814
What's the matter?
Don't you want to be on TV?

1333
01:40:59,848 --> 01:41:01,650
Man, I'm trying to tell you.

1334
01:41:02,617 --> 01:41:04,418
You don't want to go that way.

1335
01:41:04,451 --> 01:41:06,086
Fuck it.

1336
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,422
Your loss, nobody.

1337
01:41:18,232 --> 01:41:20,502
We still rolling? Over.

1338
01:41:20,535 --> 01:41:22,637
Goddamn right we are.

1339
01:41:28,643 --> 01:41:31,546
Fellas, here it comes. Over.

1340
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:33,213
Pop quiz, guys.

1341
01:41:33,247 --> 01:41:35,584
What happens
when an electric bike

1342
01:41:35,617 --> 01:41:38,853
going 60 miles per hour
hits an anti-electric field

1343
01:41:38,887 --> 01:41:41,188
going in the opposite direction?

1344
01:41:50,632 --> 01:41:52,399
Shit.

1345
01:41:52,433 --> 01:41:53,334
Fuck.

1346
01:41:53,367 --> 01:41:55,336
Shit.
We're all gonna go to jail.

1347
01:41:58,673 --> 01:42:02,209
Oh, fuck. There's no way
that that guy's alive.

1348
01:42:04,713 --> 01:42:06,648
Ah, shit.

1349
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:10,652
Goddamn.

1350
01:42:10,685 --> 01:42:12,286
I told his ass not to go.

1351
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:14,589
I told him not to go.

1352
01:42:16,524 --> 01:42:19,494
Uh, hey, OJ, what's...

1353
01:42:19,527 --> 01:42:21,930
Wh-Where the fuck are you going?

1354
01:42:21,963 --> 01:42:24,331
The fuck is he doing?

1355
01:42:25,867 --> 01:42:27,502
I'm going dark. Over.

1356
01:42:27,535 --> 01:42:30,404
Okay. No, OJ, no. No!

1357
01:42:30,437 --> 01:42:33,508
No self-respecting...

1358
01:42:50,892 --> 01:42:52,594
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1359
01:42:52,627 --> 01:42:54,538
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey. Easy, easy, easy.

1360
01:42:54,562 --> 01:42:56,598
Did you get that on camera?

1361
01:42:56,631 --> 01:42:59,400
- Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
- What happened?

1362
01:42:59,433 --> 01:43:01,513
Listen, listen, we-we
got to get you out of here.

1363
01:43:02,269 --> 01:43:04,204
- Eyes on me.
- Where's my camera?

1364
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:06,206
- Hey! Hey!
- I need my camera.

1365
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,342
Do you see it?

1366
01:43:12,681 --> 01:43:14,281
Okay. Angel?

1367
01:43:14,314 --> 01:43:15,850
- What?
- Angel, come on.

1368
01:43:15,884 --> 01:43:18,419
We got to reload.

1369
01:43:18,452 --> 01:43:20,187
Shit.

1370
01:43:28,897 --> 01:43:30,565
Wait.

1371
01:43:31,866 --> 01:43:33,535
Uh, where's your phone?

1372
01:43:33,568 --> 01:43:36,705
Why aren't you filming this?

1373
01:43:36,738 --> 01:43:38,472
What?

1374
01:43:38,506 --> 01:43:40,775
Angel, what's happening?

1375
01:43:45,345 --> 01:43:48,516
Okay, OJ, if you die
trying to save that guy,

1376
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:50,484
I'll kill you.

1377
01:43:50,518 --> 01:43:52,587
No. No, no, please.

1378
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:54,532
- Please, no. No.
- We're gonna get you out. Shut your eye.

1379
01:43:54,556 --> 01:43:56,591
- Shut your eye.
- Not before you take a picture.

1380
01:43:56,624 --> 01:43:58,660
T-Take a picture first!

1381
01:44:00,427 --> 01:44:01,996
Uh, camera reloads.

1382
01:44:04,499 --> 01:44:05,633
You can use my camera.

1383
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:06,907
No, no.
There's not enough time.

1384
01:44:09,838 --> 01:44:12,372
It's here.

1385
01:44:17,377 --> 01:44:19,379
Be Scorpion King.

1386
01:44:19,413 --> 01:44:21,015
Make a name for yourself.

1387
01:44:23,051 --> 01:44:24,351
What is that?

1388
01:44:24,384 --> 01:44:27,488
- My bad, man.
- Hey.

1389
01:44:27,522 --> 01:44:29,858
Oh, my God.

1390
01:44:29,891 --> 01:44:32,026
My camera! I need my camera!

1391
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:34,062
Oh, my God! Fuck!

1392
01:44:39,501 --> 01:44:40,778
Give me the lid.
Give me the lid.

1393
01:44:40,802 --> 01:44:43,403
Come on. All right.

1394
01:44:43,437 --> 01:44:46,641
Oh, God!

1395
01:44:46,674 --> 01:44:47,976
Oh, fuck!

1396
01:44:48,009 --> 01:44:49,309
Shit! Fuck!

1397
01:44:49,343 --> 01:44:51,445
Hey, hey! Is everybody okay?

1398
01:44:51,478 --> 01:44:53,648
For the love of fuck,
talk to me, please!

1399
01:44:53,681 --> 01:44:55,617
OJ.

1400
01:45:06,094 --> 01:45:07,762
OJ. OJ!

1401
01:45:07,796 --> 01:45:10,397
You stupid-ass motherfucker,
you better answer me.

1402
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:11,876
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

1403
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,001
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1404
01:45:13,034 --> 01:45:14,536
Are you okay?!

1405
01:45:14,569 --> 01:45:17,772
Are you good? Over.

1406
01:45:24,579 --> 01:45:27,749
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1407
01:45:27,782 --> 01:45:30,552
Oh, God!

1408
01:45:30,585 --> 01:45:32,754
Oh, God.

1409
01:45:32,787 --> 01:45:34,956
Oh, God!

1410
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:58,146
Holy shit, I-I think
it's taking the dancers.

1411
01:45:58,179 --> 01:46:00,515
Are you getting this?

1412
01:46:08,422 --> 01:46:10,525
Guys, OJ's hooded up.

1413
01:46:10,558 --> 01:46:12,827
He's doing the run.
OJ's doing the run!

1414
01:46:12,861 --> 01:46:14,729
Oh, God.

1415
01:46:14,762 --> 01:46:16,497
Hey, it's gone.

1416
01:46:16,531 --> 01:46:18,398
I can't see it anymore, guys.

1417
01:46:54,002 --> 01:46:55,837
Get it. Get it!

1418
01:47:10,618 --> 01:47:12,053
No.

1419
01:47:12,086 --> 01:47:13,821
Fuck.

1420
01:47:27,835 --> 01:47:29,604
Go! Go!

1421
01:47:32,707 --> 01:47:35,076
Lucky, go. Go, go, go, go, go!

1422
01:47:47,956 --> 01:47:51,059
Holy shit!

1423
01:47:51,092 --> 01:47:53,928
Yeah!

1424
01:47:53,962 --> 01:47:55,663
Let's go!

1425
01:47:55,697 --> 01:47:57,732
Yeah, he didn't like that,
did he?

1426
01:47:57,765 --> 01:47:59,834
OJ,
you're a motherfucking genius.

1427
01:47:59,867 --> 01:48:02,236
We got it. We got it.

1428
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:03,705
It's over.

1429
01:48:03,738 --> 01:48:05,239
It's over. We got it, y'all!

1430
01:48:05,273 --> 01:48:07,508
The feed started going
in and out when...

1431
01:48:07,542 --> 01:48:08,910
when that guy got got.

1432
01:48:08,943 --> 01:48:11,245
But we should be covered
with the film camera.

1433
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:13,480
Right, Holst?

1434
01:48:22,123 --> 01:48:23,925
The light.

1435
01:48:27,028 --> 01:48:28,896
The light, it's...

1436
01:48:30,598 --> 01:48:33,001
...gonna be magic soon.

1437
01:48:38,606 --> 01:48:40,641
What you mean, Ant?

1438
01:48:46,614 --> 01:48:48,516
Whoa, no, no.
Wh-Where you going?

1439
01:48:50,818 --> 01:48:53,054
It's gonna be all right, Angel.

1440
01:48:53,821 --> 01:48:56,090
We don't deserve the impossible.

1441
01:49:03,164 --> 01:49:04,766
Uh, hey, guys.

1442
01:49:04,799 --> 01:49:07,802
Holst just said
some creepy, cryptic shit.

1443
01:49:07,835 --> 01:49:10,104
Took his camera.
He's heading up the mountain.

1444
01:49:10,138 --> 01:49:11,939
Over.

1445
01:49:13,841 --> 01:49:15,643
Hey, Holst.

1446
01:49:15,676 --> 01:49:17,745
Holst. Wait. Hold on, man.

1447
01:49:17,779 --> 01:49:19,714
Talk to me. What happened?

1448
01:49:19,747 --> 01:49:21,883
Did you get the shot
or didn't you? Over.

1449
01:49:24,886 --> 01:49:26,621
This nigga.

1450
01:49:27,255 --> 01:49:29,290
Fuck.

1451
01:49:29,323 --> 01:49:31,325
This is crazy, right?

1452
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:49,844
Come on, come on, come on.

1453
01:49:51,145 --> 01:49:52,947
Fuck.

1454
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:17,939
No, man.

01:50:27,415 --> 01:50:29,150
Holst.

1457
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:57,278
Oh, shit.

1458
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:14,061
Fuck!

1459
01:51:27,475 --> 01:51:29,177
Oh.

1460
01:51:29,210 --> 01:51:30,912
Oh, God.

1461
01:51:30,945 --> 01:51:32,747
No.

1462
01:51:33,347 --> 01:51:35,449
Oh, shit.

1463
01:51:35,483 --> 01:51:37,118
Fuck.

1464
01:51:38,352 --> 01:51:41,022
What?

1465
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,335
Ow!

1466
01:51:56,037 --> 01:51:57,071
Fuck.

1467
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:03,110
Okay.

1468
01:52:03,144 --> 01:52:05,279
Fuck!

1469
01:52:11,319 --> 01:52:13,221
Oh, shit!

1470
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:18,226
Oh, no!

1471
01:52:32,541 --> 01:52:34,075
Don't look. Don't look.

1472
01:52:34,108 --> 01:52:37,445
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

1473
01:52:37,478 --> 01:52:39,413
Don't look. Don't look.

1474
01:52:39,447 --> 01:52:41,415
Don't look. Don't look.
Don't look.

1475
01:52:56,831 --> 01:52:58,799
Get the bike!

1476
01:52:58,833 --> 01:53:00,401
Get out of here!

1477
01:53:11,613 --> 01:53:13,515
Oh, my God.

1478
01:53:13,548 --> 01:53:15,916
You're dead! Dead!

1479
01:53:19,987 --> 01:53:22,223
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Look down.

1480
01:53:51,319 --> 01:53:52,853
Hey.

1481
01:53:52,887 --> 01:53:56,257
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1482
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:09,837
Come on.

1483
01:54:14,375 --> 01:54:16,110
No.

1484
01:54:33,662 --> 01:54:36,464
Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1485
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,434
No!

1486
01:55:18,272 --> 01:55:20,609
Just leave, OJ.

1487
01:55:20,642 --> 01:55:22,476
Forget it! Come on!

1488
01:55:24,245 --> 01:55:25,413
Come on!

1489
01:56:44,425 --> 01:56:46,460
Come on!

1490
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:42,644
It's gonna fuck you up.

1491
01:58:43,678 --> 01:58:45,614
It's gonna fuck you up.

1492
01:59:20,615 --> 01:59:22,249
Come on.

1493
01:59:22,282 --> 01:59:24,552
Come on, come on!

1494
01:59:29,991 --> 01:59:31,660
What the...

1495
01:59:57,317 --> 02:00:00,421
Come on. Come on!

1496
02:00:00,454 --> 02:00:02,524
I'm gonna get you,
you motherfucker.

1497
02:00:21,341 --> 02:00:23,310
I'm-a take you to Oprah.
I'm-a take you to Oprah.

1498
02:00:23,343 --> 02:00:25,647
Let's go to Oprah.

1499
02:01:32,814 --> 02:01:34,281
Yes!

1500
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:36,651
Yes!

1501
02:01:36,684 --> 02:01:39,721
Nobody fucks
with Haywood, bitch!

1502
02:01:39,754 --> 02:01:41,589
Nobody!

1503
02:01:41,623 --> 02:01:43,057
You hear me?!

1504
02:01:54,636 --> 02:01:57,672
Cowboys and cowgirls,

1505
02:01:57,705 --> 02:01:59,674
it's time to ride off
into the sunset.

1506
02:01:59,707 --> 02:02:02,811
That's right. Happy trails.

1507
02:02:02,844 --> 02:02:04,444
It's closing time.

1508
02:02:04,478 --> 02:02:07,615
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

1509
02:02:07,649 --> 02:02:08,950
Come back again.

1510
02:02:08,983 --> 02:02:11,351
Until then, we wish you well.

1511
02:02:11,385 --> 02:02:12,830
Okay, let's get in there
and set up.

1512
02:02:12,854 --> 02:02:15,723
Hasta la vista. Adios.

1513
02:02:15,757 --> 02:02:18,059
Yeah, get a shot of her.
Zoom in.

1514
02:02:29,737 --> 02:02:31,139
We're ready.

1515
02:02:31,172 --> 02:02:32,841
We're set up, ready to go.

1516
02:02:37,078 --> 02:02:38,813
Folks, this is Wally Pachenko

1517
02:02:38,847 --> 02:02:40,982
reporting live from Agua Dulce.

1518
02:02:41,015 --> 02:02:43,151
Just outside of Jupiter's Claim,

1519
02:02:43,184 --> 02:02:45,587
where just seconds ago

1520
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:48,590
an inexplicable occurrence,
uh, just in the distance...

1521
02:02:48,623 --> 02:02:50,992
You can probably hear
th-the shock in my voice.

1522
02:02:51,025 --> 02:02:54,128
There are still some fragments,
uh, floating in the air

1523
02:02:54,162 --> 02:02:58,465
where some-some
unidentified object

1524
02:02:58,499 --> 02:03:00,702
just drifted off into space
and exploded.

1525
02:03:00,735 --> 02:03:03,470
Uh, you can see some fragments
still falling from the sky.

1526
02:03:03,504 --> 02:03:05,506
Uh, we will have some amazing...

1526
02:03:06,305 --> 02:04:06,441
