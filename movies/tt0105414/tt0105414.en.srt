2
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,431
So how many kids do you want?

3
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,901
I don't know. What's the statistical norm?

4
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:31,873
You and your statistics. One point two.

5
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:37,612
Okay, then I want 2.2,
and I want them to look like you.

6
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:40,298
Oh, those poor kids.

7
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:45,320
So, am I gonna be able to drag you
away from the computer tomorrow...

8
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,422
to buy you that ring?

9
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,424
- Sure.
- Yeah?

10
00:02:49,504 --> 00:02:52,427
So, is this gonna be a real wedding?

11
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,530
- As opposed to a fake one?
- You know what I mean, Sam.

12
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,733
You've already been through
the big ceremony with 200 people.

13
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:02,137
That was the take one. This is the real one.

14
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,139
You can have any kind of a wedding you want.

15
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,640
Underwater.

16
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,666
You can have it at the steam room at the Y.

17
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,535
Horseback.

18
00:03:11,993 --> 00:03:13,939
Naked skydiving?

19
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,821
It's gonna have to be
a small wedding, though.

20
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,991
I haven't been in New York
long enough to know very many people.

21
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,914
Except me.

22
00:03:25,974 --> 00:03:29,331
- Well, you're invited.
- Thank you.

23
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:32,187
And my friend Graham upstairs.

24
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,863
Won't be long before you know
half the people in New York.

25
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,598
People like you, you know.
But I found you first.

26
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,704
You're the only friend I need.

27
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:51,775
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

28
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:55,413
Yeah.

29
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,537
Hello?

30
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,973
This is Lisa. May I speak to Sam?

31
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,999
Hold on a second.

32
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:21,383
- It's your ex-wile.
- What?

33
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,067
It's Lisa.

34
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,354
- Hello?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,957
- Sam, we need to talk.
- No.

36
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:31,826
- Sam, why didn't you call me?
- Because.

37
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:34,229
- Sam, you can't do this.
- I'm hanging up now.

38
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:36,255
Sam, don't do this.

39
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:42,070
I'm sorry. She shouldn't call here.

40
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,097
It's where you live. She's entitled.

41
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,396
Don't answer it.

42
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,586
- Hi, this is Allison Jones.
- Why does she do this?

43
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,289
- Talk to her now. You're up.
- All right.

44
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,391
I'll get that.

45
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,226
Hello, Sam?

46
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,897
Sam, would you pick up the phone, please?

47
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:12,233
- Please don't do this to me.
- Lisa.

48
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:15,637
Sam, I've been sitting here
since you left this afternoon.

49
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:18,440
Yeah, Lisa, honey,
can we talk about this tomorrow?

50
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,142
You can't come over here
and sleep with me, and then...

51
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:23,611
Allie, how the hell
do you shut this thing off?

52
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,613
Sam, you said you were gonna call.

53
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,333
I've been waiting for your call.

54
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,305
- Hello? Sam?
- Uh-huh.

55
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,709
Okay. Good-bye.

56
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:46,734
I take it back. She's not entitled.

57
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:50,605
I didn't go over there
intending to sleep with her, Allie.

58
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,708
Oh, well, I feel a lot better
knowing it was accidental.

59
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:57,111
She's very depressed, okay?
It was the anniversary of our divorce.

60
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,981
She heard we were getting married,
and she'd been drinking.

61
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:03,184
- I don't want to hear this.
- I feel bad for her.

62
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,487
I'm moving on. She makes me feel guilty.

63
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,324
- Believe me, it won't happen again.
- Believe you?

64
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:13,318
I'm supposed to trust you now?
Think about how I feel.

65
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,990
- Jesus, it's 4:00 a.m.
- It's me, Graham.

66
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:29,577
I'm sorry. It's... Sam left.

67
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,880
I... I told him to.

68
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,873
And, um, I can't be alone tonight.

69
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:37,619
So I came up here.

70
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,144
Thanks.

71
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,027
Allie, I let you sleep.

72
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,029
- What time is it?
- It's about 10:00.

73
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:50,198
Oh, my God!

74
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:52,781
Oh, I've got a meeting.
It's really important.

75
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,754
Hi. I'm sorry I'm a little late.

76
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:15,337
- No, no. It's worth the wait.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:18,560
So.

78
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,995
You can redefine your product on screen...

79
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:23,865
without going through
an expensive redesign process.

80
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:27,569
This is Allison Jones software,
a marketing tool no one else has.

81
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:29,571
Who do I get to run it?

82
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:32,540
I stay till everyone's up to speed.
That's included in the quote.

83
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,742
Ah, the quote.

84
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,711
That's the one thing I haven't seen.

85
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,203
Best for last.

86
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:46,487
I think you'll find that's reasonable,
as a ball park.

87
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:49,514
Here's where I was thinking of playing.

88
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,233
It makes sense for you.

89
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,536
See, after our last meeting,
I made some phone calls.

90
00:08:01,616 --> 00:08:03,605
To your former partner, for one.

91
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:06,107
Well, I wouldn't rely too much
on what she says.

92
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,776
It was not a friendly split,
and I did all the work.

93
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:12,380
She took all the credit,
and she didn't like me telling her so.

94
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,584
Well, I was more interested
in the settlement you made.

95
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:20,355
You walked off with the hardware
and a rent-controlled apartment...

96
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:24,092
which means your overhead is minimal,
as is your client list.

97
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:28,696
I could improve that
if you're as good as you say you are.

98
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:34,035
But that is the only way to prove it.

99
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:37,939
- Well, I could go for something...
- Oh, no, please, please.

100
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,809
Don't embarrass yourself.
That's my final offer.

101
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,979
Now, of course, if you
would like to think about it.

102
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,005
I'll get this.

103
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,771
You'll see it on my first expense report.

104
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:54,736
I look forward to it.

105
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,094
No messages.

106
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,963
What is this? A song cue?

107
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,299
You're nobody till somebody loves you.

108
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,302
It's just living alone, you know?

109
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:44,906
And the thought of buying those books
like Cooking For One.

110
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:46,641
It's just too depressing.

111
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:49,544
There are worse things
than being on your own.

112
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,045
You know?

113
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:54,549
- Maybe it's a sign I should go home.
- You came here for a reason.

114
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:56,818
Sam has nothing to do with that. No guy does.

115
00:09:56,898 --> 00:09:59,153
You think I'd let some guy
interfere with my acting career?

116
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:02,623
Assuming I had a career
or a guy to interfere with it.

117
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,625
You'll find someone again.

118
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,294
Maybe I will. Why not?

119
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:10,865
But the point is, if I don't, I don't.

120
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:13,668
I know that. I can do it on my own.

121
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,250
Absolutely.

122
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,264
I'll just get a roommate.

123
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,501
You could always call him.

124
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,669
Not if I have a roommate.

125
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:43,431
The managers couldn't really know
you were going to live there.

126
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:46,100
Well, that's the problem.
It's rent-stabilized...

127
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,421
so you couldn't come on the lease.

128
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,305
Nice.

129
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,775
It'd really open 'em up.

130
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:56,699
I can't wait to get in here.
Are you good with tools?

131
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:08,790
I'm an incest survivor, you know.

132
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,627
I haven't remembered the incident yet,
but I know it's there somewhere.

133
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:15,296
I just have this sense
that I survived something.

134
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,298
All my therapists think so.

135
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,467
Oh, God, a kitchen! I hate kitchens.

136
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:22,937
Cooking, cleaning, anything feminine.
I think it's my mother's fault.

137
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,072
I think this could work.

138
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,099
If you feel the same, please give me a call.

139
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,851
Hello? Sam Rawson.

140
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,376
Hello?

141
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,044
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hi.

142
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:41,115
Hi. The front door was kind of opened.

143
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,384
Are you Allison Jones?

144
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,952
Yes. Allie.

145
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:47,521
Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson.

146
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,411
We spoke on the phone this morning.

147
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:55,663
Are you sure you're okay?

148
00:12:55,743 --> 00:13:01,335
Um, you know what? I'm not.

149
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:05,006
Would it be all right
if you came back tomorrow?

150
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:07,074
Why don't you just sit down?

151
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,410
- No, I'm fine.
- Let me make you some tea.

152
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,246
I don't think I had lunch, that's all.

153
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:15,082
It's only this one.
The one in the bathroom works.

154
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,666
Here, let me help. I use a wrench.

155
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,775
Oh, wow! I'm so sorry.

156
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:44,779
And if you need a reference,
you can call them at Rizzoli.

157
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:46,805
Oh, thanks.

158
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,466
"Hedra." That's unusual.

159
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:58,484
I got terrible nicknames growing up,
which I'm not telling you.

160
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:01,796
Not "Hedy" like Hedy Lamarr?

161
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,065
That's exotic.

162
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:07,168
Well, I wasn't that exotic in grade school.

163
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,728
As opposed to now, right?

164
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:15,500
They're dry.

165
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,667
- Here.
- Thanks.

166
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,221
Oh, uh, you can just toss that.
I was just cleaning up.

167
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,590
He's the reason why
I'm looking for a new roommate.

168
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,427
- Oh.
- Yeah.

169
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:37,598
Do you think there's a chance
you guys might patch things up?

170
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:40,768
'Cause I don't want to move in
and catch you on the rebound...

171
00:14:40,848 --> 00:14:43,556
and then have things change.

172
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,460
It would just be awkward.

173
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,344
Well, nothing's gonna change, Hedy.

174
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:54,015
Except for maybe now my faucets will work.

175
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:56,150
When can you move in?

176
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,675
No, really?

177
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,019
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

178
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:15,369
I've got one friend, Graham.
He lives right above us.

179
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,406
- A friend?
- Oh, no, not like that. He's gay.

180
00:15:18,486 --> 00:15:22,943
So it's not a real friendly building,
but there's not a problem with privacy.

181
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:26,881
'Cause you just close your door. No problem.

182
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:31,218
I'll leave you alone, you know?
I mean, whatever's good for you.

183
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,487
- I don't mind.
- Wow.

184
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,557
Hey, look, Allie.

185
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,241
This could be good, huh?

186
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,796
Laundry room.

187
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:45,199
I don't go in there at night. Too creepy.

188
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,869
It's okay in the day,
but still, lock yourself in.

189
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,506
- This one?
- No, that's the mail key.

190
00:15:52,586 --> 00:15:54,775
This is creepy.

191
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:58,564
Oh, it's not bad. It's just kind of old.

192
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,165
Sometimes this gets stuck
and you have to use the screwdriver.

193
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:08,580
Excuse me.

194
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,361
- Which floor?
- Eleven.

195
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,387
Fourteen, please.

196
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:31,795
Allie, look what I found.

197
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:46,727
I'm not sure. Hold on. Let me check.

198
00:16:46,807 --> 00:16:49,378
Allie, it's Sam.

199
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:02,610
Where did you guys learn to dress like that?

200
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,479
I mean, it's just so New York.

201
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,336
Well, I think you look very comfortable.

202
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,645
Yeah. I never know what looks good.

203
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:19,660
- I think that looks nice.
- Yeah?

204
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,516
But I found this, which I think
will go great with that.

205
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:29,103
- Hey, what do you think?
- I think that you should get them.

206
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:32,006
- Oh, God, you like them?
- I think they go with that dress.

207
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:34,241
- You take them.
- Well...

208
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,029
I'll just borrow them when I want to.

209
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,027
God! I didn't know you were home.

210
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,494
I was, um...

211
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:50,050
I was, um... God, I'm sorry.

212
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,701
You haven't even been here two weeks,
and I'm already in your room.

213
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,078
I was just about to go through your drawers.

214
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,998
It smells nice on you.

215
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:07,434
Oh, I hope you don't mind.
I just always wanted to try that.

216
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:11,905
Oh, God, no. Anything of mine
that you want, just go ahead.

217
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,641
Share and share alike.

218
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:17,778
Well, I don't really know about that.
I'm an only child.

219
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,547
Do you come from a big family?

220
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,107
Mm-mm. Just me.

221
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:33,060
I, um... well, I was supposed to be a twin...

222
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,280
but she was stillborn.

223
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:38,999
Oh, that's so sad.

224
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,218
I grew up feeling a part of me was missing.

225
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:43,828
You know?

226
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,661
Allie. God!

227
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:53,604
It's beautiful.

228
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,051
Thank you.

229
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:58,786
What do I owe you?

230
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:01,789
Um, nothing. It's just a little housewarming.

231
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:04,611
Forget about it.

232
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,120
Oh, no, no.

233
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,539
They look beautiful on you.

234
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,691
- I can't take these.
- It's a housewarming.

235
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,864
Thanks. They're great.

236
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,007
Excuse me.

237
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:37,558
- Hello?
- It's me. Talk to me.

238
00:20:37,638 --> 00:20:40,861
- No, Sam.
- Why not? I'll just...

239
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,697
No, it's not a good time.

240
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm not ready to see you.

241
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,557
You're just prolonging something that's over.

242
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,789
Look, there's nothing to talk about anyway.

243
00:20:55,122 --> 00:20:58,045
Sam, there's somebody here right now.

244
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,347
All right?

245
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay. Bye.

246
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:08,538
Why don't we order some Chinese?

247
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:21,502
Hi, this is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message. Thank you.

248
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:25,739
Allie, are you there? Allie, pick up.

249
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,576
Allie, listen. Please call me back.
This is torture for me.

250
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,112
I know you need me as much as I need you.

251
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:34,681
I love you. I'll do anything
to put this back together.

252
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,570
Just call me.

253
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,489
Buddy.

254
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:46,093
Oh, yes, what a good, clean boy.

255
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,796
Yeah, you're gonna cheer her up, hmm?

256
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:51,914
Hmm? You're gonna cheer her up,
and she'll let you stay?

257
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:57,695
Shh, stay.

258
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,935
Yoo-hoo!

259
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,147
No messages.

260
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,130
I know I shouldn't have.

261
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,801
But they were just giving them away
at the market, and...

262
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,003
Well, they said I could
bring him back tomorrow.

263
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,406
Well, I hope they meant it.

264
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:33,931
Look.

265
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:39,513
His name is Buddy.

266
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:43,473
Oh, I had a dog named Buddy
when I was little, so...

267
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:52,344
Tomorrow, okay? I promise.

268
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,201
Shh. Oh, come on.

269
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:25,617
Okay, come on. Shh.

270
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,609
You're working so hard.

271
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,878
Hmm, Myerson better refer some clients to me.

272
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,562
He will. You're the best.

273
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:49,583
Oh, God! Hedy, thanks.

274
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:52,405
I never would have
gotten it done without you.

275
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,056
- I love helping.
- Crunch, crunch, crunch.

276
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,058
- What a good boy.
- Wait. Wait.

277
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,327
Come here. Family portrait.

278
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,362
Yeah. All right?

279
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,364
- Ready?
- Yeah.

280
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,889
Buddy.

281
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,972
I lived a few weeks...

282
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:14,675
while you loved me.

283
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,666
Good-bye, David.

284
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,258
Ready to kill her yet?

285
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,260
- Who? Hedy?
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,762
No, no. It's kind of fun
having a girlfriend again.

287
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,932
I can tell. I was worried
for a while, you were so down.

288
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:41,288
You were starting to look
like a Kennedy wife.

289
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,938
You were great, Graham.

290
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:47,341
I've just had to spend some time with her.

291
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:49,776
She needed a lot of help moving in.

292
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:53,947
Plus, I've been working like crazy.
I promise I'm not avoiding you.

293
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:57,718
I've got you cornered now. Actually,
I've been meaning to come and see you.

294
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,454
In fact, I was on my way
to ask you something.

295
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:04,124
Do you feel like cat sitting again?
I'm going to Boston for a wedding.

296
00:25:04,204 --> 00:25:07,761
- Fun. Sure, I'll watch Carmen.
- Great. I made you a set.

297
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:10,030
- You know which is which, right?
- Yeah.

298
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,199
And ignore the litter box this time. I do.

299
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,335
That's so cruel. We'll be fine.

300
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:17,704
You know, I think I saw her
the other day... your roommate.

301
00:25:17,784 --> 00:25:20,540
You were leaving the building.
At least, I thought it was you.

302
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,142
Your backpack, this jacket.

303
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:24,778
But when I chased you down,
you were someone else...

304
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:26,446
someone very nervous.

305
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:31,318
Oh, that's Hedy. I've freaked her out
about people knowing she's living here.

306
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:34,936
I would have had you down
to meet her, but she's shy.

307
00:25:36,737 --> 00:25:38,307
Well.

308
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,731
- Friday.
- That'd be great.

309
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,757
Make you dinner when I get back.

310
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:03,583
Hey, I thought you'd be at work.

311
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,686
Don't tell me we have the same belt.

312
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,754
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

313
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,757
- Listen, I have to talk to you.
- You have to see these. Look.

314
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:14,494
- Cookies for dogs. I had to get them.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

315
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,064
Can you talk to me for a second?

316
00:26:17,144 --> 00:26:19,886
Woof!

317
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:26,924
I tried to let you know.

318
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,815
What are you doing here? Hedy.

319
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:38,251
No, don't blame Hedy.
It's not her fault, okay?

320
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:42,956
I kind of forced my way in here.
I had to see you.

321
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:46,745
Listen, I've got to get out of here now.

322
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:50,519
Unless you need me.

323
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:02,763
Why can't you just leave me alone?

324
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,783
You gotta talk to me, baby.
You just can't pretend that I don't exist.

325
00:27:09,863 --> 00:27:13,587
It's easier that way, okay? Is that
so wrong trying to make it easier on me?

326
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,289
But people screw up.
People do something wrong.

327
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:20,427
And it was wrong, I admit it.
And you just cut them off.

328
00:27:20,507 --> 00:27:23,530
You don't take my calls.
You don't answer my letter.

329
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,999
Wait a minute. You lied to me!

330
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,502
If she hadn't called, would I have found out?

331
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:31,222
I think that's really scary, okay?

332
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,929
Please, Sam, if you want
to be nice, just stay away.

333
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:44,718
I know that there are some things
that you just can't put back together...

334
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:46,953
and I was hoping that this
wasn't one of them.

335
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,808
Well, I guess it is.

336
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,060
And I didn't get any letter...

337
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,797
so I wasn't trying to punish you
by not answering it.

338
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,732
I just didn't get it.

339
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,267
I sent it with the keys.

340
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,725
Well, I didn't get those, either.

341
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:07,140
What did it say?

342
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,743
Forget the letter.

343
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,745
I love you.

344
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,648
I can't exist without you.

345
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:17,217
I have no excuse for what I did.

346
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:20,972
Allie, you have to give me a second chance.

347
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:32,280
You really hurt me, Sam.

348
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:00,861
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where the biography section is?

349
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:04,030
- Towards the front against the wall.
- Thanks.

350
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:08,456
Hi. This is Allison Jones.
Please leave a message. Thank you.

351
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,204
Hi, Allie. It's me.

352
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:14,140
Um, I'm just calling to see if you're okay.

353
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,744
Uh, call me at work, okay?

354
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,746
My number's on the fridge.

355
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,306
Okay. Bye.

356
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:28,221
Say, next month.
Would that give her enough time?

357
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:30,390
I don't know.
We've just gotten her settled in.

358
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,973
Hedy's been wonderful.
I'm sure she'll understand.

359
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:38,798
Evening, Mr. Rawson.

360
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,552
I have an idea I must be in love with you.

361
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,773
Has it hit you that way?

362
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:50,266
Hey! It's not for you.

363
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,248
Would you like it to go on for always?

364
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:57,417
Does anything go on for always?

365
00:29:57,497 --> 00:30:00,239
Well, one likes to think some things do.

366
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,449
Where the hell have you been?

367
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,170
God! Hedy, what are you doing in my room?

368
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,375
I've been waiting since 6:00
last night to hear from you.

369
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:31,911
I've been worried sick.
Buddy was crying all night.

370
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,681
I finally had to come in here
so he'd calm down.

371
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,683
I'm sorry. I guess I just didn't think.

372
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:40,353
No, you didn't. There's such a thing
as a phone, you know?

373
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,856
This is New York. Things happen.

374
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:47,476
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It was thoughtless, really.

375
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,150
You're making me feel
like I'm 16 years old here.

376
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,663
Hey.

377
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:05,645
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

378
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:08,915
Yeah, I just...

379
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,941
Forget it.

380
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:17,357
So, I guess you patched things up
with Sam, huh?

381
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,213
Yeah. Well, I made him suffer.

382
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:24,852
- Is that an engagement ring?
- Oh, well, I...

383
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,375
It's a beautiful ring.

384
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,377
Thanks.

385
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:39,379
Really great.

386
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,848
I'm sure you'll be very happy.

387
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:43,917
You'll be very happy, and I'll be alone.

388
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:46,553
No, wait a minute. You'll find someone, Hedy.

389
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,408
I mean, God, if I can.

390
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,976
Why don't you look in the mirror? Huh?

391
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,622
Look.

392
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:04,437
You're in a different league. I know that.

393
00:33:04,517 --> 00:33:07,574
You have this great personality.

394
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:09,943
You've got this great style.

395
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:12,401
You're running your own business.

396
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:16,473
You are always gonna find someone.

397
00:33:18,198 --> 00:33:21,145
You'd have to be stupid
to think that you wouldn't.

398
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,967
Well, I guess you and Sam
want to be together...

399
00:33:34,047 --> 00:33:38,238
so I have to move out, right?

400
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:41,107
- Huh?
- Well, not right away.

401
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:43,109
Sam's gonna keep his place for a while...

402
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:45,311
and I know you just spent a lot on furniture.

403
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:50,183
Yeah, your timing is great, Allie.
It's really great.

404
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:53,586
You promised me that this
wouldn't happen. Exactly this.

405
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,723
Nothing's happened, Hedy. Come on.

406
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,716
I mean... Look, I'll talk to Sam.

407
00:34:01,674 --> 00:34:06,232
Maybe we'll move. I don't know.
Maybe we'll find someplace like this.

408
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:10,488
I don't know. But We'll see.
We'll figure something out.

409
00:34:15,388 --> 00:34:17,010
They tell me they're nervous.

410
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,479
Of course they're nervous.
They want to be sold.

411
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,681
Let's set up a demo at the staff meeting.

412
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:23,850
Something special,
something different, you know?

413
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,487
Maybe at night.
You know, open bar, open minds.

414
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:30,256
- That's "F9".
- I'll set it up.

415
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:33,760
Maybe I'll call you tonight
after I check on some things.

416
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,728
Great.

417
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,765
What's "8796, Knox"? Who's this Knox?

418
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:42,101
Oh, no, that's Graham Knox.
He's my upstairs neighbor.

419
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,970
It's the first one.

420
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,574
You know, I've got to admit
I'm very impressed.

421
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:49,691
Well, maybe you'll start spreading the word.

422
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:55,400
You know, I could see I'm not
gonna be able to afford you anymore.

423
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:02,639
Great. Just press "ENTER". That's it.

424
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,595
You thirsty?

425
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:26,103
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

426
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:46,749
Well, you would know
more about that than I would.

427
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,164
Oh, hi.

428
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,295
Allie, do you want to sit?

429
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:05,251
Oh, well, I guess I'll turn in.

430
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:08,540
Good night, Allie. Night, Sam.

431
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:25,847
- They're ready.
- All right. Just a minute.

432
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:28,561
They'll get cold.

433
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,746
All right, all right.

434
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:48,414
Rawson, actually, is a Norse name.

435
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,850
- A what?
- Norse.

436
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,953
Well, it's thoroughly uninteresting.

437
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,189
- Hey.
- Hi.

438
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:58,215
We going?

439
00:39:04,477 --> 00:39:05,898
Scrambled or tried?

440
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:07,924
This is fine.

441
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:16,909
Allie, sweetheart,
this isn't all that urgent.

442
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:20,112
You know, if you don't want to do
this apartment thing today...

443
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,615
it can wait until I get back.

444
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:26,419
Why don't we get away together,
drive to Bucks County?

445
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:29,589
- Buddy! Come here, boy.
- A bed and breakfast?

446
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,390
Come on. Three's a crowd, sweetie.

447
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,260
It's all right, Hedy. He's fine.

448
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,696
Poor guy doesn't know who's who anymore.

449
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:39,165
Why don't you and I take
a day off, rent a car...

450
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:42,335
No, that's okay. I'm fine.

451
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:45,404
I just didn't get
a very good sleep, that's all.

452
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:48,624
Nightmares. Thanks.

453
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:55,982
You guys got a good day for it,
if it doesn't get too hot.

454
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:59,652
You don't have to do that, Hedy.
You do enough already.

455
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,754
Oh, I don't mind.

456
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:04,390
It's clean when you can't tell I'm here.

457
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,949
Oh!

458
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,497
Hey, if the eggs were okay, maybe
you guys would trust me with dinner.

459
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:13,366
Do you guys know when you'll be back?

460
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:18,070
It's kind of an anniversary tonight,
so I think we're gonna eat out.

461
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:22,542
Really? Wow, that's great.

462
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:25,077
Um, well, good luck.

463
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:27,398
Thanks.

464
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,781
Good-bye.

465
00:40:46,012 --> 00:40:48,014
Buddy, come here.

466
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:52,195
Come here, sweetie.

467
00:40:54,086 --> 00:40:55,531
I know.

468
00:40:57,056 --> 00:40:58,501
I know.

469
00:41:02,261 --> 00:41:05,208
Buddy, come! Come!

470
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:12,258
Fine.

471
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:15,428
But this is hall the size
for twice the price of our place.

472
00:41:15,508 --> 00:41:18,564
- You're far too nice to Hedy.
- It's easier this way, believe me.

473
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:21,267
And this could be nice.

474
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:24,003
Can you imagine going
from the Victoria to this?

475
00:41:24,083 --> 00:41:26,172
Do you think we could smoke her out?

476
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:28,507
It would be such a mess.
I just can't do it to her.

477
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,965
I think I'm her only friend.

478
00:41:32,024 --> 00:41:33,579
My God! What happened?

479
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,139
He's fallen from one of those balconies.

480
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,693
He's dead! Buddy's dead!

481
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,095
What?

482
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,097
You left the window open!

483
00:41:51,177 --> 00:41:53,366
How could you do that?

484
00:41:53,446 --> 00:41:55,935
But I thought we could leave it open.

485
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,937
I thought you fixed it this morning.

486
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:00,373
I thought I did.

487
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:05,745
It's me. I interrupted you
when I called you in for breakfast.

488
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:07,827
Allie, it's my fault.

489
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:45,350
Thanks. That pill helped.

490
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,910
You still going on that trip tomorrow?

491
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:53,679
Well, you know, she wants me to.

492
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:03,986
If I had just let you finish
your work this morning...

493
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:14,494
Listen. If she blames anybody,
she blames me. Okay?

494
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:25,243
All right, come on. Shh.

495
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,241
Hello?

496
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,925
Hi, Mitch.

497
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:21,195
What?

498
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:25,784
Oh, God. I don't know. I'm...

499
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:29,888
No, I just... I'm just running
a little late. I didn't forget.

500
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:31,557
No, no. I...

501
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:35,141
Just hold him till 5:00, okay? Thanks.

502
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,765
You were terrific.
But you know that, don't you?

503
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:48,449
Thank you.

504
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:52,004
And here I thought...

505
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:54,325
all the guys would resist you.

506
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:57,809
As if anyone ever could.

507
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,612
Oh, no, thank you. I gotta go.
I'm just cleaning up.

508
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:03,882
Now hold it. Hold it. Not so fast.

509
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:07,352
Now, everybody under me knows more than I do.

510
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,921
I hate that.

511
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:13,558
Well, block off some time for me
next week then.

512
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:15,560
It's a little late tonight.

513
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,329
Oh, please. Please.

514
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:20,913
Just a taste. Something simple.

515
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,217
Right now.

516
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:34,095
Something simple.

517
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,334
All right.

518
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:45,824
Now, this is just the Mickey Mouse
stuff, but it does come in handy.

519
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,542
Uh-huh.

520
00:46:49,408 --> 00:46:51,730
Okay, enter the vendor's name.

521
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,499
Oh, vendor:

522
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,719
J-O-N-E-S...

523
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,353
Allison.

524
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:04,076
Very good.

525
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:07,846
Here you go. Contract price.
Payments to date. Balance outstanding.

526
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:12,451
Uh-oh. According to this,
we should've paid you last Friday.

527
00:47:12,531 --> 00:47:14,519
That's all right. Barbara will handle it.

528
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,545
Not till I give her the word.

529
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:20,992
I hope you're satisfied with what I've done.

530
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,176
So far.

531
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:25,063
But this is it.

532
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,555
I mean, well, there ain't much more.

533
00:47:28,547 --> 00:47:31,527
Except for a little tine tuning, that's it.

534
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:35,674
I have some free time if you want to
set up some meetings with your colleagues.

535
00:47:35,754 --> 00:47:39,327
I was thinking maybe I wanna
keep you all to myself.

536
00:47:43,028 --> 00:47:45,150
- Topper.
- What are you doing?

537
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,121
It's just that you're so tight right in here.

538
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:51,340
Don't. That's enough.

539
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:55,327
- Now look...
- Come on.

540
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:57,863
I've been a good boy, haven't I?

541
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:02,100
You've been a good girl,
and we have nothing to prove anymore.

542
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:07,129
Look. This is your last chance to play
before you're an old married lady.

543
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:12,569
Let me turn around, okay?

544
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,230
That's better.

545
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,411
Just a second.

546
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:34,923
Fuckin' bitch!

547
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,392
Here. Take this.

548
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,430
I can't believe I didn't see it coming.

549
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:55,020
It's just so humiliating.

550
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,889
You're too nice. That's the problem.

551
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:01,246
Men are pigs.
I don't care how nice they seem.

552
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,422
You always fall for that.

553
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:11,356
But what I did...

554
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:15,888
it was like something inside taking over.

555
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:19,911
It was scary.

556
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,481
No, Allie, don't turn this around.

557
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,249
You're the victim.

558
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,718
He should pay for this.

559
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:30,555
He'll pay. I set up all my programs
so that they have to, eventually.

560
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:36,561
What? I'm not talking about getting paid.
I'm talking about getting even.

561
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:42,267
You don't understand.
It's the contacts more than the money.

562
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:46,124
I just took the job for the word
of mouth, and now that's gone.

563
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:49,689
It's like he's put me back to square one.

564
00:49:50,522 --> 00:49:53,696
Only if you let him.
You won't let him, will you?

565
00:49:54,526 --> 00:49:55,971
What can I do?

566
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,099
Oh, Allie.

567
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:08,448
And, of course, Sam's away.

568
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,664
I didn't wanna say anything.

569
00:50:12,744 --> 00:50:16,401
How he could go on that trip
the day after Buddy died...

570
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:18,757
especially when it was his fault.

571
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:29,614
Hello. May I speak with your husband, please?

572
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,349
Who are you calling?

573
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:35,654
Yes, I know it's late. Tell him it's
Allison Jones. He'll take the call.

574
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:37,680
What are you doing?

575
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,495
Listen, you pathetic shit.

576
00:50:43,575 --> 00:50:45,964
You wanna hold on to your business?

577
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:49,467
No, you listen to me this time, asshole.

578
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,437
If you trash me around town, you are fucked.

579
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,774
And your family is fucked too, you got that?

580
00:50:55,854 --> 00:50:57,800
It won't just be you.

581
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,664
Ta-da!

582
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,769
Let me tell you,
he is pissing in his pj's right now.

583
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:14,175
Gee, Hedy, I hope you never get mad at me.

584
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:20,854
- We really have to talk.
- Please. I have a surprise for you.

585
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:27,772
Oh, Hedy, I'm really not up for this today.

586
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:29,808
What? No, no, no.

587
00:51:29,888 --> 00:51:33,678
It's gonna be tun. It'll make you
feel better. I promise. Okay?

588
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,347
And I'm paying.

589
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:37,031
So...

590
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,236
It'll be fine. Come on.

591
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:46,073
Thank you.

592
00:51:59,851 --> 00:52:01,330
You've gotta be kidding.

593
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:10,949
- You just should've asked first.
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

594
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:13,485
- Can I have Consulting Marketplace?
- Sure.

595
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:15,943
This feels so good on my neck.

596
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,311
I didn't think you'd mind.

597
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,686
Thanks.

598
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:41,303
I'm gonna take a shower.

599
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:47,770
"Ellen Besch"?

600
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,435
Sam.

601
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:15,850
Want me to fix you something before I go?

602
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:20,926
No, thanks. I'm just gonna
go up and visit Graham.

603
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:24,909
- I love myself like this.
- Have fun.

604
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,093
Yeah.

605
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:32,801
I love myself like this.

606
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,211
Taxi!

607
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,014
Hey!

608
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:35,566
Don't lose her. It's very important.
She has something oi mine.

609
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:27,748
Hey. Come on.

610
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,342
Do you wanna play?

611
00:57:52,737 --> 00:57:54,410
No, thanks.

612
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:12,910
Come on, Jim.

613
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,847
Allie. Hey, Allie. Regular or diet?

614
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:17,849
Diet.

615
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,084
- Something's different.
- Yes.

616
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,644
Jim, you look like my sisters boyfriend.

617
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,156
Jesus, what is it?

618
00:58:25,236 --> 00:58:29,707
You've gotta help me, Graham.
You've gotta tell me what to do.

619
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,616
I'm home.

620
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,582
Goddamn it.

621
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,684
It's so weird.

622
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,987
It was like looking at myself.

623
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:57,789
And she lies.

624
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:00,725
I found a shoe box in her room.

625
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:03,061
Nothing she told me is true.

626
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:07,231
Like, the twin who she said died at birth.

627
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:10,087
It was in an accident when she was nine.

628
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:15,159
And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me.

629
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:22,313
- I have to do something.
- Get rid of her.

630
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,682
Call the police if you have to.

631
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:28,039
If she's lying and stealing,
you've got to get her out of there.

632
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:32,340
You're right. I'll tell her tonight.

633
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:36,327
I can't just throw her out on the street.

634
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:39,130
- She obviously needs help.
- She's a lunatic.

635
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,622
She's got to go. Do it tonight.

636
00:59:43,314 --> 00:59:46,537
I feel responsible somehow,
like I'm the only one she has.

637
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:48,392
Except for maybe her parents.

638
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,226
Either she's gone by Saturday,
or I go to the police.

639
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,804
That was very impressive.

640
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:01,119
I can be butch when I have to.
I get it from my mother.

641
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,822
If you're worried about her,
I know a shrink. Maybe he can help.

642
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:07,925
Oh, God. Well, maybe after
I talk to her she'll just leave.

643
01:00:08,005 --> 01:00:12,363
- Do you wanna sleep here tonight?
- Look, don't tempt me.

644
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,599
I just needed to talk it out.

645
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,283
Thanks.

646
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,807
She's not gonna chase me out of my own place.

647
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:24,642
When's Sam coming back?

648
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:26,677
Oh, tomorrow.

649
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:29,313
- That's good.
- Yeah.

650
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:32,183
Oh. This is a little embarrassing...

651
01:00:32,263 --> 01:00:35,186
but since we're letting our hair down...

652
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:38,389
these little air vents
between our apartments...

653
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,525
carry sound.

654
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:42,551
It's a weird acoustic thing.

655
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,684
Well, what do you hear?

656
01:00:49,847 --> 01:00:51,302
Oh, no.

657
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:54,739
Oh, no. God. I am... I am so embarrassed.

658
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,974
Big deal. I'm sorry
I didn't mention it sooner.

659
01:00:57,054 --> 01:01:00,866
- I am so sorry.
- You sure you wanna go down there?

660
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,251
Yeah.

661
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,777
She's my problem. I'll handle it.

662
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,577
- Thank you for the tea.
- You're welcome.

663
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,381
I'll see you tomorrow.

664
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:10,881
Jesus. It's a lot more serious
than I thought.

665
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:13,851
No. I know you can't diagnose over the phone.

666
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:18,289
I don't know what hyper-vigilant is.
Phil, I never met the woman.

667
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:21,680
She could be infantile
or paranoid. I don't...

668
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:37,074
Let me go downstairs. If I call you
from there, will you talk to my friend?

669
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:40,077
- She can tell you better than I.
- Fine. Call when you get there.

670
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:41,898
Right. Okay?

671
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:45,916
Thanks. So, all right...

672
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:50,604
You might here from us. Love to Jack,
and you're not charging me for this.

673
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:00,746
Carmen.

674
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:11,595
Good night.

675
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:16,863
I'm sorry.

676
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,750
- Wait.
- What?

677
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,155
It's okay. Take it easy.
We just want to get you some help.

678
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:27,992
No, please. Please!
I didn't do anything wrong.

679
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:29,560
Take it easy.

680
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,629
I'm sorry. I didn't do anything.

681
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:32,744
I know.

682
01:03:41,952 --> 01:03:46,811
Hello, Mr. Besch. You don't know me.
My name is Allison Jones.

683
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:51,015
I think my roommate, Hedra,
is your daughter... Ellen...

684
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:52,972
I'm not sure, really.

685
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:59,114
She's... she's been under
a lot of stress lately...

686
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,393
and well...

687
01:04:02,473 --> 01:04:06,297
God. I really would rather not
get into this on an answering machine.

688
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:09,667
Could you please give me a call? Or her?

689
01:04:09,747 --> 01:04:14,638
I'm sure you have the phone number.
It's 212-555-9814.

690
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:18,063
I'd really appreciate it,
and don't say I called.

691
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:20,391
Oh, thank you.

692
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,982
What?

693
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,129
Are you all right?

694
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:51,859
I can't hear you.

695
01:04:55,493 --> 01:05:00,251
It's okay. I was just starting to worry.
You've been in here so long.

696
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:04,108
I'm making some tea.
You want some tea? Chamomile.

697
01:05:07,605 --> 01:05:09,209
Yeah.

698
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,419
That'd be great.

699
01:05:21,852 --> 01:05:23,593
I'm not feeling well.

700
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:35,040
Mine always comes
when I'm wearing something nice.

701
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:44,518
Are you crampy? Sometimes tea helps.

702
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:46,931
Something warm.

703
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:48,957
And we could talk.

704
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:52,318
About what?

705
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,107
About Sam and I wanting
this place for ourselves.

706
01:05:57,187 --> 01:06:01,329
It's just crazy keeping two places like this.

707
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:09,320
I thought you wanted a long engagement
to be sure you can trust him again.

708
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,438
Well, frankly, Hedy, that's my business.

709
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,860
I'm sorry, but it is.

710
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,544
Uh-huh.

711
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:22,089
It's... it's me, isn't it?

712
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:29,807
I'll change, Allie. I can change.

713
01:06:29,887 --> 01:06:32,776
No. That's not it at all.

714
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,767
You've been a good roommate.

715
01:06:35,693 --> 01:06:38,749
It's just that this is the man
I'm gonna marry.

716
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,332
I want us to start our lives together.

717
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:45,789
Well...

718
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,625
he will cheat on you again.

719
01:06:47,705 --> 01:06:50,094
That's a promise.

720
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:53,964
And when he does,
don't come running to me, okay?

721
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:56,786
'Cause I've had it with you.

722
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:59,356
You're so fucking weak.

723
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:06,626
I'm sorry.

724
01:07:07,725 --> 01:07:09,568
I'm so sorry.

725
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,298
Hello?

726
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:28,365
Sam?

727
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,534
Ellen, is that you?

728
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:32,803
Talk to me, or your mother.

729
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:35,306
Honey, we miss you. We want you to come home.

730
01:07:35,386 --> 01:07:38,409
- Don't call here again.
- Listen to me.

731
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:41,612
We'll stop sending the checks
if you don't come.

732
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:45,640
Promise. No doctors this time. Just come...

733
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:52,743
An obscene phone call. New York.

734
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,561
Find someone else, jerk!

735
01:07:57,641 --> 01:08:00,965
I'm expecting a call from Sam.
He might be coming in tonight.

736
01:08:01,045 --> 01:08:04,049
Just for a little while, okay?
Sam'll call back if it's busy.

737
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,520
I'm sorry.

738
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:11,308
It's no big deal. I'll find some other place.

739
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:14,044
I just... I don't want you making a mistake.

740
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:15,728
I understand.

741
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,798
Hey, we'll still be friends, keep in touch.

742
01:08:21,331 --> 01:08:22,708
Sure.

743
01:08:47,825 --> 01:08:49,279
Hello?

744
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,948
No, it's Hedy.

745
01:08:51,028 --> 01:08:53,304
Hi. Where are you?

746
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:57,321
I just came in from the airport.
Is she asleep?

747
01:08:57,401 --> 01:08:59,323
Yeah.

748
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:01,191
It's after 2:00.

749
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:02,993
Should I wake her?

750
01:09:03,073 --> 01:09:05,178
Yeah, tell her to surprise me.

751
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:09,667
- I'll tell her.
- Good night, Hedy.

752
01:09:09,747 --> 01:09:11,602
Good night, Sam.

753
01:09:11,682 --> 01:09:13,286
Sleep well.

754
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,271
What? What?

755
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:09,827
Hey, Allie, what are you doing here?

756
01:10:09,907 --> 01:10:11,511
Shh.

757
01:10:23,821 --> 01:10:26,199
Oh, geez.

758
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:40,691
No, I'm not Allie.

759
01:10:40,771 --> 01:10:42,910
Well... No...

760
01:11:48,639 --> 01:11:50,243
Hey.

761
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,553
Hey, sleepy guy.

762
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:04,123
I knew it.

763
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:08,345
Knew what?

764
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:09,947
I told her.

765
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:12,816
Guys like you don't change.

766
01:12:12,896 --> 01:12:14,807
You can't be faithful.

767
01:12:15,499 --> 01:12:17,604
And now she'll know, hmm?

768
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:22,108
She'll know what?

769
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:29,333
That you came up here
and pretended to be her?

770
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:33,270
I mean, my God, what is this hair?
What is this supposed to mean?

771
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:36,524
You're in her clothes.
You're wearing her perfume.

772
01:12:42,326 --> 01:12:44,214
You knew it was me.

773
01:12:44,294 --> 01:12:47,551
Come on. You knew...

774
01:12:47,631 --> 01:12:49,577
and you didn't care.

775
01:12:51,768 --> 01:12:53,523
Well...

776
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,879
I think she should know that.

777
01:12:56,673 --> 01:12:59,779
You think she's gonna thank you
for that news, do ya?

778
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:04,368
Well, I don't expect you
to understand our friendship.

779
01:13:04,448 --> 01:13:07,429
Oh, she cannot fuckin' stand you,
for Christ's sake!

780
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:12,509
- That's not true.
- Aw, bullshit!

781
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:14,511
- Mm-mm.
- You're too needy.

782
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:18,038
You're always clingy.
You're constantly in her face.

783
01:13:18,996 --> 01:13:21,318
She needs me.

784
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:24,988
Who was there for her when
her boss almost raped her, hmm?

785
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,190
- What?
- Who took care of her?

786
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:29,927
You were off on a business trip
or screwing someone.

787
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:32,229
She never said a word to me about that.

788
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:34,448
That's right. She told me.

789
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:41,905
So, don't try and make me think
that we're not close.

790
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:47,025
We lean on each other,
and we protect each other.

791
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:51,134
We're best friends.

792
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:54,442
You're nuts, you know that?

793
01:13:57,367 --> 01:14:00,109
I think you're outta your skull.

794
01:14:03,373 --> 01:14:06,596
Yeah, well, sticks and bones, okay?

795
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,280
Oh, man. Man.

796
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,692
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

797
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:16,473
Look...

798
01:14:16,553 --> 01:14:19,076
I know you wanna save face.

799
01:14:19,156 --> 01:14:21,678
I won't tell her. Okay?

800
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:24,982
Just... Just pick up the phone
and call her...

801
01:14:25,062 --> 01:14:28,669
and tell her that you're going back
to your ex-wife or something.

802
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:31,555
I won't say a word.

803
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:34,624
Yeah. Well, you won't have to say
a word, sweetheart...

804
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:37,514
because I'm gonna tell her myself.

805
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:40,611
Fuckin' bitch!

806
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:00,032
Hey.

807
01:15:06,136 --> 01:15:09,345
I'm sorry, sir, but the party
doesn't seem to have checked in.

808
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,830
Yes, sir. Why don't you try again later?

809
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:17,153
That'll be fine. Good night, Miss Jones.

810
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,294
Good night.

811
01:16:02,993 --> 01:16:04,748
Oh, hi.

812
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:08,218
I hope I didn't wake you.
I got an early start.

813
01:16:08,298 --> 01:16:11,245
No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you
to move out today.

814
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:15,192
There, I'm done. See?

815
01:16:15,272 --> 01:16:20,430
I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some
of my stuff in the cage downstairs.

816
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,957
That way I won't have to bother
you two when I move.

817
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:26,619
Sure, that's fine.

818
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:30,707
Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out.

819
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:32,342
Well...

820
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:35,512
I better get this stuff out of here.

821
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:37,280
I'll help.

822
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,982
I'll open the door.

823
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:41,201
We can have breakfast when you get back.

824
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:27,964
And now, morning news break.

825
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:30,217
We go to midtown Manhattan...

826
01:17:35,252 --> 01:17:38,875
Police found the body of a man
brutally murdered early this morning.

827
01:17:38,955 --> 01:17:42,712
Identification of the victim...
a white male around 30 years old...

828
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:45,081
is pending notification of next of kin.

829
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,818
A witness I spoke to described
hearing the sound of a struggle...

830
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:52,277
emanating from Room 612
around 4:00 this morning.

831
01:17:57,641 --> 01:17:59,462
Atherton Hotel.

832
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:03,500
Sam Rawson's room, please. Room 612.

833
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:06,803
I'm sorry. There's been an accident.

834
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:09,022
I think you should speak with...

835
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:05,950
What are you doing down there?

836
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:15,038
I just suddenly felt sick.

837
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:17,207
It was the funniest thing.

838
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:19,858
I hope I'm not pregnant.

839
01:19:21,091 --> 01:19:23,913
- Let me help you.
- I'm fine.

840
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,939
Let me get you some water.

841
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:29,252
Hey.

842
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,936
Drink some.

843
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:39,963
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

844
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:42,632
I'm going out for a while.
I'm much better now.

845
01:19:42,712 --> 01:19:44,601
I thought you said breakfast.

846
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:47,737
It's in the blender. I gotta go.

847
01:19:47,817 --> 01:19:49,592
Dressed like that?

848
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:55,545
Well, I'm just gonna go upstairs
and see Graham.

849
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,605
He called while you were out.

850
01:20:02,132 --> 01:20:06,489
Well, still, if you're not feeling well...

851
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,571
you should wear more than that.

852
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:15,249
Maybe you're right.

853
01:20:19,149 --> 01:20:21,720
Leave the door open so we can talk.

854
01:20:34,431 --> 01:20:36,707
You know why I think you're sick?

855
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:42,015
You're upset about Sam.

856
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:54,528
You know Sam's dead, don't you?

857
01:20:57,787 --> 01:21:00,131
Yeah. We don't have much lime.

858
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:08,003
You didn't do it, Hedy, did you?

859
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,635
You couldn't have!

860
01:21:14,737 --> 01:21:16,341
Why?

861
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:24,801
He came in my mouth and then tried
to beat the shit out of me...

862
01:21:24,881 --> 01:21:26,656
because I wanted to tell you.

863
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:31,699
You know, it was an accident.

864
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,963
But...

865
01:21:38,795 --> 01:21:40,399
he deserved it.

866
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:46,489
Come on.

867
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,515
The police will be here soon.

868
01:21:49,506 --> 01:21:50,951
But...

869
01:21:52,342 --> 01:21:54,288
But you shouldn't run.

870
01:21:56,546 --> 01:21:58,992
It'll only make it worse.

871
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,423
I know you weren't yourself
when you did this.

872
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,898
I know. I was you.

873
01:22:08,258 --> 01:22:10,329
Who is this Hedy, anyway?

874
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:14,684
No one's seen her.

875
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:16,573
She's not on the lease.

876
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:20,914
There's not even a fingerprint of hers here.

877
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:23,650
I've been cleaning like crazy.

878
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:31,801
You have to come with me, Allie,
or they'll put you away.

879
01:22:31,881 --> 01:22:34,170
It'll never work!

880
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:35,888
Besides...

881
01:22:36,653 --> 01:22:38,326
people have seen you.

882
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,712
Just calm down.
We'll call a lawyer or a doctor...

883
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:45,500
and they'll explain it to the police.

884
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:59,010
Why are you making me do this?

885
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:03,900
We're friends...

886
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,756
and you could be
in a lot of trouble without me.

887
01:23:08,885 --> 01:23:11,024
But I'm not gonna leave you.

888
01:23:12,855 --> 01:23:14,744
That wouldn't be right.

889
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:16,713
I won't leave you.

890
01:23:16,793 --> 01:23:18,548
Okay, let's go.

891
01:23:18,628 --> 01:23:20,403
Come on. Up.

892
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,687
Let's go. Go.

893
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:26,371
Come on.

894
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:29,675
Come on.

895
01:23:31,774 --> 01:23:33,796
No, no, no. Up to Graham's. Come on.

896
01:23:33,876 --> 01:23:36,065
Let's not involve Graham. Let's just leave.

897
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:37,681
He's already involved.

898
01:23:49,659 --> 01:23:51,948
- Nobody's home.
- Use these.

899
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:54,975
Come on. Go on. Hurry up. Go! Go!

900
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,422
He must be sleeping.

901
01:23:59,502 --> 01:24:01,448
We were up late last night.

902
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,815
He can't hear you.

903
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,685
Wait'll you see me.

904
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:21,800
Your color was beautiful, but I can't go
around looking like you anymore, can I?

905
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:25,938
Okay, now, Allie, don't laugh.

906
01:24:28,598 --> 01:24:29,872
Ta-da!

907
01:24:36,673 --> 01:24:41,397
- Five years ago, these creatures...
- How's that? Good?

908
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:44,934
23 and 24 are the movie channels.

909
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:46,869
I gotta cash a paycheck.

910
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:50,273
So, I'll only be gone an hour.
I know how you hate to be alone.

911
01:24:50,353 --> 01:24:52,308
Okay, are you good? Are you comfortable?

912
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:53,992
All right.

913
01:24:55,825 --> 01:24:57,270
So...

914
01:24:58,294 --> 01:25:00,683
Well, when I get back,
we'll do your hair too.

915
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,334
Okay? Be good. Bye.

916
01:25:58,488 --> 01:26:00,510
What's the part this time?

917
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:03,696
- Excuse me?
- You're an actress, right?

918
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:07,717
- You're never the same person twice.
- Oh.

919
01:26:07,797 --> 01:26:09,419
I like it.

920
01:26:09,499 --> 01:26:12,021
I just thought the other was more you.

921
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:15,458
Well, maybe next time I'll try blond.

922
01:26:15,538 --> 01:26:17,093
Really?

923
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:18,628
I'm flattered. Thanks.

924
01:26:18,708 --> 01:26:20,663
- Miss Besch.
- Yes?

925
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:22,865
A guy's been calling. Says he's your father.

926
01:26:22,945 --> 01:26:25,735
Might have to come to New York
if you don't call him.

927
01:26:25,815 --> 01:26:26,919
Miss Besch.

928
01:26:36,392 --> 01:26:37,336
Hey!

929
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,344
Jerk!

930
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:07,967
Hey!

931
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,399
You live here?

932
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:16,919
No, I'm just watching
the place for the weekend.

933
01:27:16,999 --> 01:27:20,089
It's on a timer. I was out. I'm sorry.

934
01:27:20,169 --> 01:27:24,049
- I have to register a complaint.
- Oh, please. I'll turn it off.

935
01:27:38,221 --> 01:27:39,996
How could you do that?

936
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:44,213
Everything I've done I've done for you.

937
01:27:44,293 --> 01:27:46,432
The people you hated I hated.

938
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:52,313
People like you don't care.

939
01:27:55,004 --> 01:27:57,860
You're just like that stupid girl in Tampa.

940
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:01,581
She called my parents too,
told 'em all my secrets.

941
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,926
You want to put me away, huh?

942
01:28:10,386 --> 01:28:12,175
I can't...

943
01:28:12,255 --> 01:28:15,845
I can't keep making excuses for you, Allie.

944
01:28:15,925 --> 01:28:17,529
I can't.

945
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:23,910
Oh, God.

946
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:56,005
What?

947
01:28:58,467 --> 01:28:59,912
Please.

948
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:10,887
Don't make me leave you, Ellen.

949
01:29:47,116 --> 01:29:48,595
Shh.

950
01:29:49,285 --> 01:29:50,889
It's okay.

951
01:29:54,824 --> 01:29:57,270
We've got to get out of here now.

952
01:30:11,974 --> 01:30:14,363
Jesus. Mitch!

953
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:16,423
- What?
- Get in here!

954
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:21,853
What is it? What?

955
01:30:23,219 --> 01:30:24,941
Look.

956
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:26,625
It's erasing.

957
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:31,805
I didn't do anything.

958
01:30:33,162 --> 01:30:34,266
Shit.

959
01:30:37,533 --> 01:30:39,513
Hey!

960
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,748
On mine too!

961
01:30:53,582 --> 01:30:57,340
"Contact Allison Jones within 24 hours,
or the rest of your data...

962
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,342
will be irretrievably lost.

963
01:30:59,422 --> 01:31:03,393
This payment policing program is
in all Allison Jones software."

964
01:31:05,294 --> 01:31:06,830
Bitch!

965
01:31:08,397 --> 01:31:10,519
Should I plug this in the phone jack?

966
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:12,188
Uh-huh.

967
01:31:12,268 --> 01:31:14,991
- Great.
- You can make reservations on this?

968
01:31:15,071 --> 01:31:16,826
Mm-hmm.

969
01:31:16,906 --> 01:31:18,494
You pay by credit card.

970
01:31:18,574 --> 01:31:20,329
Wow.

971
01:31:20,409 --> 01:31:22,365
L.A., right?

972
01:31:22,445 --> 01:31:23,933
Yeah.

973
01:31:24,013 --> 01:31:26,402
No answer at the first number.

974
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:27,984
What's this note?

975
01:31:38,928 --> 01:31:40,549
Busy.

976
01:31:40,629 --> 01:31:43,405
You turn 'em off. You turn 'em all off!

977
01:31:53,776 --> 01:31:57,246
Things are gonna be different
in L.A. You'll see.

978
01:31:59,115 --> 01:32:01,904
- First class?
- Is it worth it?

979
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:05,441
Well, we can use one of Grahams cards.

980
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:08,377
I think I saw his wallet in the living room.

981
01:32:08,457 --> 01:32:10,746
Oh, me too. Okay.

982
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:12,430
I'll go see.

983
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:28,518
I can't find it.

984
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,426
I know I saw it somewhere.
Maybe it's in the kitchen.

985
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:55,974
It's going down.

986
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:09,754
It's okay.

987
01:33:49,325 --> 01:33:50,980
Excuse me, miss?

988
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:54,132
Is this 1203? Is Graham Knox at home?

989
01:33:56,899 --> 01:33:58,587
He's on a cruise.

990
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:02,615
Actually, I'm looking for a woman.
Allison Jones. Do you know her?

991
01:34:03,505 --> 01:34:04,827
Who are you?

992
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:06,695
Mitchell Myerson.

993
01:34:06,775 --> 01:34:08,846
She did a job for me.

994
01:34:12,615 --> 01:34:15,104
There's no one named Jones on this floor.

995
01:34:15,184 --> 01:34:17,506
Yeah, I know. I was just down
at her apartment.

996
01:34:17,586 --> 01:34:19,675
I did contact her here once.

997
01:34:19,755 --> 01:34:22,745
Well, I'm the only one here now...

998
01:34:22,825 --> 01:34:25,714
and I never met her.

999
01:34:25,794 --> 01:34:28,604
- If you'll excuse me.
- Oh, sorry. Let me get that.

1000
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:34,440
This is hers. You do know her.

1001
01:34:42,978 --> 01:34:45,652
What the fuck is going on here?

1002
01:34:49,652 --> 01:34:51,256
Be careful. She's crazy.

1003
01:34:52,621 --> 01:34:55,033
- Get off her.
- What?

1004
01:34:56,592 --> 01:34:59,348
You think she wants you touching her? Huh?

1005
01:34:59,428 --> 01:35:00,702
Get off her!

1006
01:35:02,965 --> 01:35:04,740
I hear you. I'm gettin' up.

1007
01:35:15,744 --> 01:35:16,688
Hurry.

1008
01:35:19,915 --> 01:35:23,590
- Where is she?
- Don't worry. I took care of her.

1009
01:35:52,915 --> 01:35:55,919
I don't wanna try to be loved anymore.

1010
01:35:57,619 --> 01:36:02,778
I don't wanna be scared anymore...

1011
01:36:02,858 --> 01:36:05,314
or to kill anymore.

1012
01:36:05,394 --> 01:36:08,017
I don't wanna kill anymore.

1013
01:36:08,097 --> 01:36:12,554
I don't wanna be alone anymore.

1014
01:36:12,634 --> 01:36:17,226
I don't wanna be anything anymore.

1015
01:36:17,306 --> 01:36:21,897
I don't need a reason to kill myself.

1016
01:36:21,977 --> 01:36:23,923
I need a reason not to.

1017
01:36:25,681 --> 01:36:27,285
There isn't one.

1018
01:36:32,221 --> 01:36:34,667
You wanna say anything special to anyone?

1019
01:36:38,327 --> 01:36:41,536
Okay. Allison Jones. Go on.

1020
01:36:50,773 --> 01:36:52,810
There.

1021
01:36:56,278 --> 01:36:58,224
Now they'll know it was you.

1022
01:37:01,283 --> 01:37:04,093
No one who knows me will believe
that I wrote that.

1023
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:07,133
I was never that scared.

1024
01:37:11,293 --> 01:37:13,382
Not like that.

1025
01:37:13,462 --> 01:37:15,237
Of course it's you.

1026
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,206
I never met anyone so scared of being alone.

1027
01:37:24,773 --> 01:37:27,830
I saved you from that...

1028
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,753
but you don't care.

1029
01:37:34,316 --> 01:37:39,775
Did you know that identical twins
are never really identical?

1030
01:37:39,855 --> 01:37:42,563
There's always one who's prettier.

1031
01:37:44,059 --> 01:37:47,438
And the one who's not does all the work.

1032
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:53,912
She used me, and then she left me.

1033
01:37:56,104 --> 01:37:57,845
Just like you.

1034
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:02,644
Go on. Take them.

1035
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,360
Come on, Allie. It's nicer this way.

1036
01:38:42,651 --> 01:38:43,755
Please.

1037
01:38:47,356 --> 01:38:52,396
I'm not like your sister.
Not anymore. I'm like you now.

1038
01:39:00,168 --> 01:39:01,806
I'll kill you!

1039
01:39:02,638 --> 01:39:04,584
Get off him!

1040
01:39:10,312 --> 01:39:12,258
Graham, stay inside!

1041
01:41:59,815 --> 01:42:02,819
Hey, here you are.

1042
01:42:11,593 --> 01:42:13,732
Don't make me come get you.

1043
01:42:19,267 --> 01:42:20,871
Come out now.

1044
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:23,841
Come on.

1045
01:42:31,012 --> 01:42:32,650
Come on!

1046
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:36,471
Come out now!

1047
01:42:36,551 --> 01:42:38,963
Allie, please!

1048
01:42:41,022 --> 01:42:42,797
I'm scared.

1049
01:42:43,892 --> 01:42:45,496
Where are you?

1050
01:43:26,968 --> 01:43:29,346
Why are ya hiding from me?

1051
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,832
Think I can't find you? Huh?

1052
01:43:36,912 --> 01:43:39,017
Your goddamn shirt
is stickin' outta the door.

1053
01:44:24,426 --> 01:44:26,465
I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.

1054
01:44:28,864 --> 01:44:31,208
Graham says that won't bring him back.

1055
01:44:32,767 --> 01:44:34,838
He says I have to start letting go.

1056
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:37,993
He's right.

1057
01:44:38,073 --> 01:44:40,362
Hedy's parents said that for years...

1058
01:44:40,442 --> 01:44:44,390
they tried to explain to her that
her sister's death wasn't her fault...

1059
01:44:45,714 --> 01:44:48,524
but she never forgave herself for surviving.

1060
01:44:49,885 --> 01:44:53,332
So, every day I try to forgive Hedy for Sam.

1061
01:44:54,556 --> 01:44:57,412
Then I try to do what she couldn't...

1062
01:44:57,492 --> 01:44:59,438
forgive myself.

1063
01:45:01,162 --> 01:45:03,802
I know what can happen
to someone who doesn't.

1064
01:45:04,305 --> 01:46:04,748
