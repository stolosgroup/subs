When you go to the ball...

3
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,026
you have to learn how to dance
like a princess, right?

00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,812
<i>1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3...</i>

00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,233
<i>- 1, 2, 3...
- Yeah!</i>

00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:18,776
<i>What are you gonna wear today?</i>

7
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,444
<i>- I'm gonna wear...
- You're gonna wear...</i>

8
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,364
<i>- I'm gonna wear...
- A bucket on your head.</i>

9
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:26,367
<i>- No!
- 1, 2, 3... No?</i>

10
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:29,453
<i>- And a barrel round your bottom.
- No!</i>

11
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,831
<i>- And cloth bags for shoes?
- Nooo!</i>

14
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:49,853
Good morning.

15
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:54,649
Hey buddy!

16
00:06:54,652 --> 00:06:56,360
Want something to eat?

17
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:59,280
No. I'm not hungry.

18
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,597
Yeah, that's fine.

19
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,278
Yeah.

20
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:38,566
<i>Franklin?</i>

21
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:43,126
<i>Hey. It's me. I just
wanted to leave a message.</i>

22
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,922
<i>Do you think we could make
some time to talk later</i>

23
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:49,092
<i>just the two of us, without the kids?</i>

24
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:52,052
<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

25
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:55,266
<i>Okay?
I miss you.</i>

26
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:30,889
Eva Khatchadourian!

27
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,161
It's a lot.

28
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,083
Look, Eva.

29
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:56,792
I don't really care who you are

30
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,502
or what you've done so long as
you can type and you can file.

31
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:01,381
You can have this job.

32
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:06,051
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you.

33
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,766
I wont let you down.
I promise you. Thank you.

34
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,812
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

35
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,024
See you Monday.

36
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,777
Great. Thank you.

37
00:11:41,094 --> 00:11:43,718
Looks like someone is having
a nice day?

38
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,305
Enjoying yourself?

39
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:46,807
I'm sorry?

40
00:11:51,398 --> 00:11:55,689
I hope you rot in hell, you
fucking bitch!

41
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:04,742
Jesus. What the hell was that?
Are you ok?

42
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:06,120
No, no, no, it's nothing.
Its really... its nothing.

43
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:08,329
- Let me call 911.
- No, no, it was my fault.

44
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,333
- But she just totally...
- No, no, I'm fine.

45
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,669
<i>Eva, when are you coming home?</i>

46
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,926
<i>I miss you.</i>

47
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:40,600
<i>I love you.</i>

48
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:34,074
<i>Promise me you'll never
go away again.</i>

49
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,827
<i>I will never, never,
never go away again.</i>

50
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:42,207
<i>Promise me. Promise me</i>

51
00:14:43,213 --> 00:14:45,296
<i>you'll never go away again.</i>

52
00:14:55,226 --> 00:14:56,558
Is it safe?

53
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,935
No, it's not safe.

54
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,313
Sure?

55
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,152
Are you sure about this?

56
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,569
<i>This really happened?</i>

57
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:53,454
<i>I can see, I can feel it...</i>

58
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,896
<i>We did it.</i>

59
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,529
I'm gonna need all these processed
today, Eva.

60
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:28,492
Uh, but today my afternoon off.

61
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:29,870
You remember? I told you.

62
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:31,580
Ah shit, that's right.

63
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,874
- Look, give these to Massughi.
- Sure.

64
00:18:41,017 --> 00:18:43,101
- Hey, Eva.
- Hey, Al.

65
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,253
No, let go of me!
Let go of me, man!

66
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:28,049
- Get off me!
- Keep walking.

67
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:31,470
Hey lady! Lady! Lady! Please help me!
I didn't do nothing, man!

68
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,144
Get off of me!

69
00:20:42,986 --> 00:20:47,027
Eva, you can stop resisting.

70
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:50,034
Stop resisting, Eva.

71
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:54,664
Eva!

72
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,337
Rise and shine.

73
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,798
It's late, Eva.

74
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,093
The day is almost over.

75
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:03,846
- Hiii! - Don't pick him up.
Please don't pick him up.

76
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,933
I just put him down, Franklin.

77
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:10,479
Hi.

78
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:14,650
There he is. You wanna play?

79
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:16,988
You wanna play?

80
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:21,785
It's alright.

81
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:26,290
Just rock him a little bit.
He's alright.

82
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:30,044
Do you think I'm exaggerating?

83
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:34,922
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

84
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:38,051
You just have to rock him a
little bit.

85
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:40,597
There's my little dude!

86
00:25:23,462 --> 00:25:25,962
Jesus! All 12?

87
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:31,427
- I'll take them as they are.
- But they are totally broken...

88
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:32,889
I'll take them as they are!

89
00:26:04,174 --> 00:26:06,840
<i>You're gonna be a good looking boy.</i>

90
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:09,803
<i>All the girls are gonna love you.</i>

91
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:29,156
I know it. Don't wake up.
Don't wake up.

92
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:34,622
Can you say "mommy"?

93
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:39,000
"mom-my", "mommy", Kevin?

94
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,590
Can you say "ball"? "ball"?
"ba-", "ba-", "ba-".

95
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,636
"Ball"?

96
00:26:46,347 --> 00:26:47,847
No?
Okay.

97
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:51,723
I'm gonna throw it to you, and you're
gonna roll it back to me, okay?

98
00:26:51,728 --> 00:26:53,144
Okay.

99
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:54,896
Roll it back to mommy.

100
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,901
Roll it back. Roll.
Roll it back.

101
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:10,872
Okay, okay.

102
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,958
Roll it back, okay?
Roll it back.

103
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:18,212
Roll it back.
Roll it back.

104
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:21,715
When he was a baby,
he never stopped screaming.

105
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:24,010
I thought maybe it had damaged
his hearing.

106
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:29,935
No, his hearing is fine.

107
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:35,481
But shouldn't he be talking by now?

108
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,526
I read somewhere that non-verbalizing
was the...

109
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,780
an early sign of autism.

110
00:27:44,285 --> 00:27:47,285
He has none of the tell-tale rocking signs.

111
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,792
I wouldn't worry about it too much.

112
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,802
He's a fluffy little boy, isn't he?

113
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,681
But there is nothing wrong with him.

114
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,315
Thank you.

115
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,531
Okay.

116
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:22,075
Roll it back to mommy.

117
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:32,459
Okay. Gonna roll it back again.

118
00:28:32,464 --> 00:28:34,088
That was really good, Kev.

119
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:37,174
Okay. Here we go.
Okay?

120
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:39,137
Okay?

121
00:28:51,527 --> 00:28:54,734
<i>"E" is for elephant,
large as a house,</i>

122
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:58,363
<i>he's big as can be,
not small like a mouse.</i>

123
00:28:58,367 --> 00:29:02,283
Can you say "Elephant, Kevin?
"Elephant"?

124
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:04,664
"Elephant".

125
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:07,669
Kevin!

126
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:11,628
Kevin?
Can you say "mommy" for me?

127
00:29:11,632 --> 00:29:13,256
No!

128
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:15,716
- "Mommy"?
- No!

129
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,845
- Just say "mommy".
- No.

130
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,877
Trick or treat?

131
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:21,213
Trick or treat?
Hey lady. We know you're in there.

132
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:36,982
<i>I don't like that!</i>

133
00:32:36,985 --> 00:32:38,360
<i>I don't like that!</i>

134
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,028
<i>I don't like that!</i>

135
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:45,822
Mommy was happy before little Kevin
came along. Do you know that?

136
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:51,371
And now mommy wakes up every morning...

137
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:54,668
and wishes she was in France!

138
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,560
That elevator is a death trap.

139
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:12,187
He needs a yard,
somewhere he can toss a ball,

140
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,566
fill a pool.

141
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,527
But I love New York.

142
00:33:18,488 --> 00:33:19,987
Come on!

143
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,864
You sound like a bumper sticker.

144
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,491
It's a matter of priorities, Eva.

145
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:26,537
He's only gonna be a kid once.

146
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:29,457
You can house hunt all you want.

147
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,418
I'm telling you, I'm not leaving the city.

148
00:33:32,588 --> 00:33:34,462
Kevin, stop that. That's enough.

149
00:33:34,465 --> 00:33:36,130
Let mommy and daddy talk.

150
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,758
Kevin, quit that!

151
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,848
<i>You have your family room here.</i>

152
00:33:44,851 --> 00:33:48,517
<i>Master bedroom is back there
and two huge walk-in closets.</i>

153
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:51,732
<i>The bathroom is amazing.</i>

154
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,296
Here we are, guys.

155
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:14,132
Our very own castle.

156
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:55,967
I'm gonna go and grab some lunch.
Does anybody want anything?

157
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:14,157
Hey! Hey!
Wait up! Mrs. K!

158
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:20,841
Hey! It's me!

159
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:23,042
Soweto.

160
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,381
Hi there.

161
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:32,927
I just wanted to see how you were.

162
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:38,057
I'm fine. Thanks.

163
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:41,102
You look well.

164
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:45,271
Yeah. The doctors are saying there's
a chance I might walk again.

165
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:47,486
That's great.

166
00:35:50,866 --> 00:35:52,616
Well, you take care, Mrs. K.

167
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,410
You, too.

168
00:36:32,078 --> 00:36:33,911
Come on, come on!

169
00:36:33,914 --> 00:36:36,871
Die! Die!

170
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:39,208
No! No! No!

171
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:43,337
- Die!
- How do you jump?

172
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:46,508
Die!

173
00:36:51,224 --> 00:36:52,933
Go! Go! Go! Go!

174
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:54,936
Die!

175
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:08,407
Hey Kev? Are you out there?

176
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,868
Kevin?

177
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,413
Kevin, you hear that?
Dad goes pee pee.

178
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,751
You can do that too.

179
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:43,903
So you want a connector right there.

180
00:37:43,907 --> 00:37:47,906
You see? And click on that link
and it should open right up.

181
00:37:47,912 --> 00:37:51,828
And If it doesn't...
we'll try it again.

182
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:55,083
- So you left click. Wanna give it a try?
- Sure.

183
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:57,962
- No, no.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:37:57,965 --> 00:38:01,339
- Right click, right there.
- Yeah.

185
00:38:01,343 --> 00:38:03,425
See that? It comes up.

186
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:07,179
Right. Yeah, thanks.
I think I got it.

187
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,684
Thank you for your help.

188
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:28,289
I pooped.

189
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,667
Hey buddy. What?

190
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,086
You pooped?

191
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:37,046
Oh okay. Here let me help you.

192
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,425
Okay.

193
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:41,802
Go to your room. I'll be right there.

194
00:38:43,014 --> 00:38:44,971
Let's not wake up mommy.

195
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:46,892
Go on! Go on, buddy.

196
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:27,017
These squiggly squares
of paper, they are dumb.

197
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,692
Everybody needs a room of their own.

198
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:35,695
You have your room.
This is the mama's room.

199
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:38,822
I can help you make your room special,
if you'd like.

200
00:39:38,826 --> 00:39:40,868
What do you mean, "special"?

201
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:45,831
Well, so it looks like your personality.

202
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:49,794
What personality?

203
00:39:51,674 --> 00:39:53,549
I think you know what I mean.

204
00:39:56,096 --> 00:39:57,763
They're dumb.

205
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:24,124
No, no, no. I mean it's good.

206
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,835
You don't need me to do that?

207
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:29,548
And... and the guys...

208
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:32,467
Okay.

209
00:40:34,972 --> 00:40:37,221
Well, I mean, if you have it in hand...

210
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:39,057
I could.

211
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,393
Really?

212
00:40:43,773 --> 00:40:46,230
Well, that all sounds great.

213
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,609
Okay, John.

214
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,945
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

215
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,708
Kevin?

216
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:05,253
Kevin?

217
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:51,804
What else do you have to say?

218
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,267
Go wash your face!

219
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,080
He said, he's really sorry.

220
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:19,293
And that he was only trying to help
make it special.

221
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,614
Do you remember how you got that?

222
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:50,328
It's the most honest thing
you ever did.

223
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:56,000
Do you know how they potty train cats?

224
00:42:56,963 --> 00:42:59,296
They stick their noses in their own shit.

225
00:43:01,676 --> 00:43:03,383
They don't like it.

226
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,636
So they use the box.

227
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:10,683
Okay. Let's work on our counting.

228
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:13,644
- What comes after 3?
- 9.

229
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:19,067
- What comes after 7?
- 71.

230
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,778
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

231
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:26,030
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

232
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:30,619
21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

233
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:35,375
31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

234
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:41,380
41, 42, 43, 44, 45,
46, 47, 48, 49, 50.

235
00:43:41,387 --> 00:43:43,637
Now, can we quit?

236
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:54,702
There.

237
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:58,527
You can add that together
if you think you're so smart.

238
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:15,339
You did not...

239
00:44:17,677 --> 00:44:19,468
You did not...

240
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:42,160
Are you enjoying yourself?

241
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:17,073
I can see the doctor by myself.

242
00:45:33,011 --> 00:45:35,552
I have to tell you something, Eva.

243
00:45:36,806 --> 00:45:39,265
It's a brave boy you've got there.

244
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:48,024
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

245
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,635
What mamma did
was very, very wrong.

246
00:46:15,724 --> 00:46:19,308
And she's so, so sorry.

247
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:34,742
Hey, Kev? Kev, hold on a sec!

248
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:37,539
Kev?

249
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:39,541
Kevin?

250
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:44,002
Hey Kev.
What happened?

251
00:46:44,798 --> 00:46:46,297
I broke my arm.

252
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:48,173
How did you brake your arm?

253
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:50,009
I had poopy pants.

254
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:52,464
Mommy went to get wipes.

255
00:46:52,474 --> 00:46:55,723
I fell off the changing table
onto my dump trucks.

256
00:46:55,727 --> 00:46:58,560
Mom took me to doctor Goldbutt.

257
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:06,987
It's all my fault.

258
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,367
No, no, don't be silly.

259
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,203
You can't watch him
every second of the day.

260
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,113
Franklin...

261
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:01,882
Unbelievable.

262
00:48:03,635 --> 00:48:05,468
How did you get him
to do that?

263
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:11,768
Well, whatever it was it worked.

264
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:28,411
Not yet.

265
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:41,551
Okay.

266
00:49:00,615 --> 00:49:02,031
I love you, kiddo.

267
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:12,859
I don't like that.
Turn it off.

268
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,665
Honey. Do you mind if we stop
over at the store?

269
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,878
I wanna go home.

270
00:50:31,007 --> 00:50:33,382
It's just that I need to pick up...

271
00:50:42,311 --> 00:50:43,686
Home it is.

272
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,708
Hey, guys!

273
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:07,877
Hey, Dad! How was work?
Did you take any cool pictures?

274
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:21,227
Eva, he's just a boy.

275
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:25,187
He's a sweet little boy.

276
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:27,275
That's what boys do.

277
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:22,670
Mom is fat!

278
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:30,252
When did you...
When were you gonna tell me?

279
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:32,631
Soon. Now.

280
00:52:34,135 --> 00:52:36,635
How am I part of the decision now?

281
00:52:37,472 --> 00:52:39,306
What am I supposed to say now?

282
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:50,648
So, the daddy bear plants his seed
in the mommy bear

283
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:53,486
and it grows into an egg.

284
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:55,907
Is this about fucking?

285
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,080
Do you know what that means?

286
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,166
The boy puts his pee pee
in the girl's doo doo.

287
00:53:08,674 --> 00:53:10,090
Well...

288
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:13,549
Haven't you ever wished
you had somebody else around to play with?

289
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:14,928
No.

290
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,512
You might like it.

291
00:53:16,515 --> 00:53:18,431
What if I don't like it?

292
00:53:18,434 --> 00:53:20,350
Then you get used to it.

293
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:22,685
Just because you're used to
something...

294
00:53:22,688 --> 00:53:24,270
doesn't mean you like it.

295
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:25,940
You're used to me.

296
00:53:29,864 --> 00:53:31,363
Yes, well...

297
00:53:31,366 --> 00:53:35,866
In a few months we're all gonna
get used to somebody new.

298
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:42,375
Beautiful.

299
00:53:43,211 --> 00:53:46,710
Hey, Kev. Come over and meet your
little sister.

300
00:53:46,715 --> 00:53:50,047
This is your brother. It's Kevin.

301
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:52,801
It's your big brother.

302
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:56,304
Yes, yeah.

303
00:53:56,309 --> 00:54:00,642
It's Kevin.
Yes, yes...

304
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:03,897
Kevin! Don't do that.

305
00:54:03,901 --> 00:54:06,566
No, Kevin. That's not nice.

306
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,653
It's OK.

307
00:54:08,657 --> 00:54:11,073
We're getting snacks, okay?
Come on.

308
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:29,423
<i>Christ! To Ecuador? For 2 months?
Why can't you send someone else?</i>

309
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:33,013
<i>I really wanna work this deal.</i>

310
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,352
<i>First he cries too much,
then he's too quiet.</i>

311
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:41,104
<i>Then he makes up his own little language,
and it's annoying.</i>

312
00:54:41,108 --> 00:54:44,107
<i>He has trouble toilet-training.
A lot of kids do.</i>

313
00:54:44,112 --> 00:54:45,861
<i>And you see this as some kind
of personal vendetta?</i>

314
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:47,363
<i>This is not good for him.</i>

315
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:53,284
<i>Franklin, pick up the god damn phone!</i>

316
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,289
<i>Pick up the god damn phone.</i>

317
00:54:57,293 --> 00:55:01,125
...13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19...

318
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:05,380
...20, 21, 21, 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 27...

319
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:22,982
Please! Please! Let me have
a drink. I'm begging you! Pleeeease!

320
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,329
Kevin?

321
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,915
Kevin!

322
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,418
Honey?

323
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:40,923
Are you ok?

324
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:08,620
I'm sorry, mom.

325
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:11,278
Not to worry, sweetheart.

326
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,294
You couldn't help it.

327
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:19,381
"By my soul," cried Gilbert.

328
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:22,300
"Art thou the devil in blue,
to shoot in that wise?"

329
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:26,886
"Nay," quoth Robin, laughing,
"not quite so ill as that, I trust."

330
00:56:26,892 --> 00:56:29,892
"And he took up another shaft... "
Are you okay, honey?

331
00:56:36,904 --> 00:56:40,236
"And he took up another shaft
and fitted it to the string."

332
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,739
"Again he shot..."

333
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:45,075
"and again he smote the arrow
close beside the center;"

334
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:47,494
"a third time he loosed his bowstring"

335
00:56:47,498 --> 00:56:50,164
"and dropped his arrow
just betwixt the other two"

336
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:51,668
"and into the very center,"

337
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:54,336
"so that the feathers of all three
were ruffled together,"

338
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:57,839
"seeming from a distance
to be one thick shaft."

339
00:56:57,844 --> 00:57:02,009
"And now a low murmur ran
all among that great crowd..."

340
00:57:02,014 --> 00:57:03,931
Hey champ. How are you doing?

341
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,434
Feeling better?

342
00:57:07,604 --> 00:57:09,770
Go away. I'm tired.

343
00:57:11,109 --> 00:57:13,109
Oh. Okay.

344
00:57:14,362 --> 00:57:17,111
Sure thing, buddy.
You just get some rest, okay?

345
00:57:17,115 --> 00:57:19,781
Don't stop reading, mom.

346
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:30,290
"Two hundred and eighty score
shafts were shot in all,"

347
00:57:30,296 --> 00:57:33,879
"and so deftly were they sped that
when the shooting was done"

348
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:37,299
"each target looked like
the back of a hedgehog"

349
00:57:37,304 --> 00:57:40,138
"when the farm dog snuffs at it."

350
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:31,361
Good afternoon, ma'am.

351
00:58:31,364 --> 00:58:33,447
I hope this isn't an inconvenient time.

352
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,032
Well, it is actually.

353
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:37,368
Well, we just have a couple
of quick questions for you.

354
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:39,455
What's this about?

355
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,457
Do you know where you are
spending the afterlife?

356
00:58:43,376 --> 00:58:46,283
Oh, yes, I do as a matter of fact.

357
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:48,046
I'm going straight to hell.

358
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:50,297
Eternal damnation, the whole bit.

359
00:58:50,302 --> 00:58:53,135
Thank you for asking.
Okay?

360
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,813
Hey, honey. Let me help you with that.

361
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:07,066
I can dress myself.
Can you leave?

362
00:59:09,156 --> 00:59:10,656
Sure.

363
00:59:11,826 --> 00:59:13,408
I'm glad you're feeling better.

364
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,743
Do you want some more of that
chowder for lunch?

365
00:59:15,747 --> 00:59:17,246
Whatever.

366
00:59:17,248 --> 00:59:20,748
- Or a grilled cheese sandwich?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

367
00:59:30,596 --> 00:59:33,262
Thank you, dad, this is so cool!

368
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:34,681
You're welcome, buddy.

369
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:36,768
Right. Here we go.
In the middle.

370
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:39,353
Ooooh. Almost. Here.

371
00:59:39,356 --> 00:59:41,939
Take that one.
Try again.

372
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,652
Use your finger...

373
00:59:45,695 --> 00:59:47,070
Keep your eyes in the middle.

374
01:00:43,927 --> 01:00:45,677
Good shot, Kev.

375
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:47,762
You're a natural.

376
01:00:50,352 --> 01:00:51,767
Perfect.

377
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:53,436
Thanks, dad.

378
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:33,564
<i>Right.</i>

379
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,734
<i>It's like this.</i>

380
01:01:38,988 --> 01:01:40,654
<i>You wake up.</i>

381
01:01:40,657 --> 01:01:42,907
<i>Then you watch TV.</i>

382
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:47,576
<i>You get in the car, then you
listen to the radio.</i>

383
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:52,163
<i>Then you go to you little job
or your little school</i>

384
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:55,753
<i>but we're not gonna hear about
that on the 6 o'clock news.</i>

385
01:01:57,926 --> 01:01:59,341
<i>Why?</i>

386
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:02,261
<i>Because nothing is really happening.</i>

387
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:06,598
<i>Then you go home
and watch some more TV.</i>

388
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:09,434
<i>Or maybe it's a fun night,
and you go out</i>

389
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,272
<i>and you watch a movie.</i>

390
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:15,525
I mean it's got so bad,
that half the time

391
01:02:15,529 --> 01:02:17,361
the people on TV,

392
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:21,448
inside the TV,
they're watching TV.

393
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:25,787
And what are all these
people watching?

394
01:02:30,879 --> 01:02:32,796
People like me.

395
01:02:35,718 --> 01:02:38,968
<i>And what are all you
doing right now</i>

396
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,723
<i>but watching me?</i>

397
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:47,060
<i>You don't think they would
have changed the channel by now</i>

398
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,813
<i>if all I did
was getting "A" in geometry?</i>

399
01:03:37,953 --> 01:03:41,202
Me and Kevin were playing
"Christmas kidnapping".

400
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:43,373
Kevin!

401
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:47,625
Kevin, you're my friend!
You're my friend.

402
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:50,547
Beat it, Celia.
Get me a soda.

403
01:04:00,728 --> 01:04:03,394
No, nott that one, you retard.

404
01:04:03,398 --> 01:04:04,973
Get me a root beer. - Hey!

405
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,233
What?

406
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:14,241
Thanks, Celia.
I was thirsty.

407
01:04:17,997 --> 01:04:19,496
Hey, you wanne know a secret?

408
01:04:19,499 --> 01:04:20,916
Come closer.

409
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:24,251
Do you know who else is thirsty?
You don't?

410
01:04:27,591 --> 01:04:29,674
It's the vacuum monster.

411
01:04:30,095 --> 01:04:31,761
Cut it out!

412
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:38,017
- Hey troops!
- Daddy!

413
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,936
Ho, ho, ho. Look what I got!
Kev, come here. Give me a hand.

414
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,316
Yeah, sure, dad.

415
01:06:05,783 --> 01:06:09,783
- You wanna dance?
- No thanks, Harland.

416
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:16,708
- Come on. Just one.
- I don't dance, really.

417
01:06:28,141 --> 01:06:30,891
Where do you get off,
you stuck up bitch?

418
01:06:34,148 --> 01:06:36,982
Do you think anyone else
is gonna want you now?

419
01:06:55,922 --> 01:06:57,839
Come on. Stay for another drink.

420
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:01,427
Come on.
Come on.

421
01:07:21,617 --> 01:07:23,199
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

422
01:07:23,202 --> 01:07:25,536
Can we leave a carrot for the reindeer?

423
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,144
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

424
01:07:43,975 --> 01:07:45,392
Kevin!

425
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:31,358
Didn't I see you at the
bookstore today?

426
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:35,698
Nope.

427
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:39,368
Funny, I could have sworn.

428
01:08:45,377 --> 01:08:48,210
By the way, are you doing
anything on Friday?

429
01:08:51,676 --> 01:08:53,051
Why?

430
01:08:56,139 --> 01:08:58,721
I just thought we might
do something together.

431
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:00,642
For fun.

432
01:09:02,062 --> 01:09:03,562
Like, do what?

433
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:07,732
Maybe take you for dinner.

434
01:09:08,402 --> 01:09:10,985
Or play around with
miniature golf?

435
01:09:26,338 --> 01:09:27,713
Okay.

436
01:09:41,815 --> 01:09:43,606
Why didn't you bring a coat?

437
01:09:45,484 --> 01:09:48,068
You just can't get uncomfortable
enough, can you?

438
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:51,280
Uncomfortable?
With my own mother?

439
01:10:02,796 --> 01:10:05,379
Whenever I see fat people,
they are always eating.

440
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:10,131
Dont' give me any of this "slow
metabolism, it's the glands" crap.

441
01:10:10,138 --> 01:10:11,721
It's food.

442
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:13,722
They are fat because
they eat the wrong food.

443
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:15,808
Too much of it, and all the time.

444
01:10:20,566 --> 01:10:23,148
You know, you can be
kind of harsh sometimes.

445
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:25,650
You're one to talk.

446
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:27,640
Yeah, I am.

447
01:10:28,483 --> 01:10:30,366
I wonder where I got it.

448
01:10:48,513 --> 01:10:51,013
Well, you won.

449
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:15,706
So. What next, momsy?

450
01:11:16,378 --> 01:11:19,544
We're gonna go home. You're gonna get
changed into something reasonable.

451
01:11:19,548 --> 01:11:21,214
And I'm taking you to dinner.

452
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,216
Great.

453
01:11:36,733 --> 01:11:38,650
We're going to dinner.

454
01:11:41,072 --> 01:11:42,655
I was hungry.

455
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:45,074
I'm a growing boy, you know.

456
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:59,003
I'll have a... calorie salad,

457
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:03,925
steak, medium rare,
and a bottle of merlot.

458
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:06,430
All right.

459
01:12:20,907 --> 01:12:23,366
So, how's school going?

460
01:12:28,707 --> 01:12:30,374
It's going.

461
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:32,836
On a course schedule.

462
01:12:35,465 --> 01:12:38,047
How about your teachers?
Are there any who are...

463
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:41,135
Right, what bands am
I listening to these days?

464
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,222
Next you can weed all about whether there
isn't some cute little cunt

465
01:12:46,227 --> 01:12:48,559
in the front row
who's got me itchy.

466
01:12:48,562 --> 01:12:52,145
That way you can segway into how it's
all up to me, of course

467
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:57,234
but before balling the chick in the hallway,
that I might decide to wait until I'm ready.

468
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:00,489
Right around dessert,
you can ask about drugs.

469
01:13:00,493 --> 01:13:01,909
Real careful, like

470
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:04,618
cause you don't want to scare me
into, like, lying my head off.

471
01:13:04,622 --> 01:13:07,830
So you have to say
how you've experimented.

472
01:13:10,421 --> 01:13:12,878
Then finally once you've sucked
up that entire bottle of wine,

473
01:13:12,882 --> 01:13:14,339
you can go all gooey-eyed

474
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:17,340
and say how nice it is to spend
quality time together,

475
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:21,011
then scooch over and put your
arm around my shoulder.

476
01:13:21,516 --> 01:13:23,474
Give it a little squeeze.

477
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,102
Fuck!

478
01:15:28,907 --> 01:15:32,782
- Your computer is fucked, isn't it?
- Yeah. It's fucked.

479
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:38,329
And so are all the ones at work.
I guess I deserved it.

480
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:48,173
- Why would you let out something like that?
- I collect them.

481
01:15:51,515 --> 01:15:53,598
Isn't that a weird thing to collect?

482
01:15:53,602 --> 01:15:56,518
I don't like stamps.

483
01:16:00,192 --> 01:16:01,692
But what is the point?

484
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:05,718
There is no point.

485
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,531
That's the point.

486
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:17,374
No, it really hasn't been any trouble
at all. Everybody is bringing a dish.

487
01:16:27,805 --> 01:16:32,305
Oh! That's them now. I got to go.
OK, you have a great day.

488
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:35,813
Bye, mom.

489
01:16:37,816 --> 01:16:39,316
Merry Christmas.

490
01:16:56,129 --> 01:16:58,087
Alright, Kev.
You're next.

491
01:16:59,674 --> 01:17:01,174
Can you guess what it is?

492
01:17:06,056 --> 01:17:10,221
That's a series 7. The guy in the
store said it was the best one.

493
01:17:10,227 --> 01:17:15,977
- Gee, dad. Thank you so much.
- Merry Christmas. - It's perfect.

494
01:17:23,241 --> 01:17:26,283
What did you eat for breakfast?

495
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,541
How was your day, Snuffles?

496
01:17:48,853 --> 01:17:50,935
Did you hear that thump?

497
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,815
That's a powerful thing, man.

498
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:04,244
Celia!

499
01:18:09,209 --> 01:18:11,792
Come on, honey. Time for bed.
Here we go.

500
01:18:21,598 --> 01:18:23,723
I thought I closed the door.

501
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:29,270
Kevin said I'm stupid,
and he's right.

502
01:18:30,859 --> 01:18:32,609
You're not stupid, honey.

503
01:18:34,946 --> 01:18:39,113
Don't you worry. We'll find him.
Now you scoot down. Come on.

504
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,707
Cozy?

505
01:19:24,585 --> 01:19:27,584
I'm sure Snuffles has gone to
the big pet store in the sky.

506
01:19:27,588 --> 01:19:31,253
- Don't say that! Don't say that!
- Yes. It's the truth!

507
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:32,758
Dearly beloved,

508
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,593
We are gathered here
to mourn Mr. Snuffles...

509
01:19:35,597 --> 01:19:36,929
Stop it!

510
01:19:36,932 --> 01:19:42,432
...who was snuffed out... tragically early.

511
01:19:43,356 --> 01:19:47,271
So daddy and mommy were looking for him
the whole night.

512
01:19:47,276 --> 01:19:49,692
And you know why we couldn't find him?

513
01:19:49,695 --> 01:19:53,528
Because Snuffles has gone
to live in the garden.

514
01:19:54,284 --> 01:19:56,075
He's living in the garden now,

515
01:19:56,078 --> 01:19:59,245
with a whole bunch of new animal friends.

516
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,127
Celia.

517
01:20:08,549 --> 01:20:10,216
Okay, give me the spoon.

518
01:20:12,263 --> 01:20:14,846
So, they're having a big party tonight...

519
01:20:15,725 --> 01:20:21,599
with the chipmunks, and the squarrels,
and the racoons...

520
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:26,356
and they're eating nuts, and berries,

521
01:20:26,778 --> 01:20:32,611
and they're gonna have a whole bunch...

522
01:21:47,493 --> 01:21:50,076
Why did you leave the drain stuff out?

523
01:21:51,831 --> 01:21:53,581
I didn't.

524
01:21:54,334 --> 01:21:56,667
- I put it away!
- Then how did it get out?

525
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:08,554
Ask Kevin.

526
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,766
Kevin did it.

527
01:22:14,106 --> 01:22:16,523
You need to go talk to someone.

528
01:23:34,027 --> 01:23:38,152
Kev, mom had something
that she wanted to tell you.

529
01:23:48,627 --> 01:23:50,877
I wanted to...

530
01:23:52,257 --> 01:23:54,715
thank you for calling the ambulance.

531
01:23:58,513 --> 01:23:59,888
And?

532
01:24:02,142 --> 01:24:03,475
And...

533
01:24:05,061 --> 01:24:10,478
I was concerned that you might
be feeling responsible.

534
01:24:12,112 --> 01:24:13,487
Why is that?

535
01:24:15,073 --> 01:24:17,572
Because you was supposed to
be looking after her.

536
01:24:17,575 --> 01:24:19,825
We just don't want you to
blame yourself.

537
01:24:20,954 --> 01:24:24,663
No. I don't...
I mean I... I never said I did.

538
01:24:25,834 --> 01:24:28,417
She's gonna need a glass eye, Kevin.

539
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:32,086
So, we would appreciate you
looking after her,

540
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:34,176
and any namecalling...

541
01:24:36,055 --> 01:24:39,596
You don't really remember being
a kid much do you, dad?

542
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:42,684
Celia is just gonna have to
suck it up.

543
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:51,861
I thought you didn't like those.

544
01:24:53,032 --> 01:24:55,865
Well, they're a...
Now what do you call it...

545
01:24:59,038 --> 01:25:00,955
an acquired taste.

546
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,522
I'm so sorry.

547
01:26:08,865 --> 01:26:10,282
There you go.

548
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:17,290
Okay.

549
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:23,797
Thank you, mommy.

550
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:41,398
- Hey, kiddo. Going to practice?
- Yeah, you know it.

551
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:44,735
- Hey, Celia, you wanna come collect arrows?
- No!

552
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:10,180
So...
What do you wanna do?

553
01:27:17,442 --> 01:27:20,817
We'll last out the school
year if we can and...

554
01:27:22,405 --> 01:27:24,530
make arrangements over the summer.

555
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,745
At least custody
is a no-brainer.

556
01:27:32,291 --> 01:27:33,708
Is it?

557
01:27:37,631 --> 01:27:39,381
You've decided?

558
01:27:41,385 --> 01:27:43,760
Eva, there's nothing left to decide.

559
01:27:46,056 --> 01:27:47,431
It already happened.

560
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:03,238
- Needed a drink of water.
- Hey you, Kev.

561
01:28:05,411 --> 01:28:06,993
Listen, buddy,

562
01:28:06,996 --> 01:28:10,996
it's easy to misunderstand something
when you hear it out of context.

563
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:17,005
Why would I not know the "context"?

564
01:28:19,593 --> 01:28:21,427
I am the context.

565
01:28:40,033 --> 01:28:42,365
- You have to appeal.
- No.

566
01:28:42,368 --> 01:28:44,617
But you'll lose everything,
the business, your house.

567
01:28:44,621 --> 01:28:46,954
I hate the house.
I always have.

568
01:28:46,957 --> 01:28:48,623
You'll rot in hell!

569
01:29:08,231 --> 01:29:11,731
A personal for Kevin Khatcha...
dourian?

570
01:29:18,743 --> 01:29:20,409
- Careful, it's heavy.
- It is? - Yeah.

571
01:29:22,580 --> 01:29:24,830
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

572
01:29:53,698 --> 01:29:57,031
What are they for?
You never ride your bike.

573
01:29:57,035 --> 01:29:59,867
I got these for a song of the web.

574
01:29:59,871 --> 01:30:02,454
I'll make a bundle selling them at school.

575
01:30:03,208 --> 01:30:05,292
Like Donald Trump, huh.

576
01:30:45,922 --> 01:30:47,755
I'll take you back to my ship.

01:32:16,606 --> 01:32:18,106
Ready for the big dip?

<i>- Yeah.</i>

591
01:32:42,384 --> 01:32:43,901
<i>- Yes, I did.
- Did you eat all your cereal?</i>

592
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:46,386
<i>-Yes, I did.
-Alright.</i>

593
01:32:54,398 --> 01:32:57,814
You're a little clammy.
Feeling okay?

594
01:32:57,818 --> 01:32:59,735
Never better.

595
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:06,072
Hey, only three days to go
till you're 16.

596
01:33:06,077 --> 01:33:09,243
We should do something.
How about Sunday?

597
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,081
Don't know.

598
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,416
Might be tied up.

599
01:33:15,255 --> 01:33:18,629
Come on, clean up some of this mess
and then we're gonna get dressed and go.

600
01:33:18,633 --> 01:33:20,007
I do not want to go to school.

601
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:22,842
I know, but daddy has to take a shower,
we have to go.

602
01:33:22,846 --> 01:33:24,763
Say goodbye!

603
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:38,942
<i>Do you think we could make some time

<i>I really wanna work this thing out.</i>

606
01:33:44,703 --> 01:33:47,203
Doesn't Kevin go to Gladstone High?

607
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:25,913
<i>Franklin...</i>

608
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:29,499
<i>Pick up the god damn phone!
Franklin...</i>

609
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,453
I have my son there.

610
01:35:02,623 --> 01:35:03,998
Kevin?

611
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:06,917
Kevin!

612
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,380
Have you seen Kevin?

613
01:35:14,387 --> 01:35:15,720
Kevin!

614
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:18,473
Kevin!

615
01:37:10,014 --> 01:37:13,347
Lauren!

616
01:38:37,528 --> 01:38:39,820
Franklin?

617
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:48,538
Celia?

618
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:57,382
Franklin?

619
01:39:01,554 --> 01:39:03,138
Celia?

620
01:43:53,126 --> 01:43:55,374
You don't look happy.

621
01:44:01,386 --> 01:44:02,886
Have I ever?

622
01:44:06,726 --> 01:44:09,142
I'm almost 18, aren't I?

623
01:44:13,148 --> 01:44:17,648
What is it?
Going to the big school making you nervous?

624
01:44:20,074 --> 01:44:21,574
Nervous?

625
01:44:23,911 --> 01:44:26,828
Do you know anything about
those places?

626
01:44:34,006 --> 01:44:38,506
Well, you managed it all so well.

627
01:44:40,179 --> 01:44:45,346
Tried as a minor.
Out of your head on prozac.

628
01:44:47,186 --> 01:44:49,686
You'll be out of there
in a couple years.

629
01:44:57,115 --> 01:44:58,781
Do you know what day it is today?

630
01:44:58,784 --> 01:45:01,284
Why the let me come see you
on a Monday?

631
01:45:02,203 --> 01:45:06,120
Sure. It's my anniversary.

632
01:45:08,377 --> 01:45:10,127
Two years.

633
01:45:11,797 --> 01:45:14,380
Plenty of time to think about it.

634
01:45:28,566 --> 01:45:33,566
I want you to tell me why.

635
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,677
Used to think I knew.

636
01:45:58,683 --> 01:46:01,433
Now I'm not so sure.

637
01:46:22,536 --> 01:46:24,042
