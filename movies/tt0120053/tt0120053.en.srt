00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,387
Simon Magus was a magician
and a sorcerer...

3
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,473
in... um...

4
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,474
In Sumeria.

5
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:02,769
What happened
to Simon Magus, Bartolo?

6
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:05,896
Jesus' disciples
performed miracles.

7
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:08,961
When Simon Magus
saw the miracles...

8
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:11,984
he offered Peter gold
for God's powers.

9
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:13,944
How did Peter respond...

10
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,529
John Rossi?

11
00:01:18,948 --> 00:01:20,157
Stand up!

12
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:27,914
Answer, John Rossi.

13
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,417
That's not my name.

14
00:01:32,501 --> 00:01:35,086
You and all
the other bastards...

15
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,754
lucky enough to be here...

16
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,340
children of sin,
spawn of the damned...

17
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:44,093
are all named for saints...

18
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:48,680
saints who are disciplined,
saints who are chaste.

19
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,100
You are named
for John Baptist Rossi...

20
00:01:53,142 --> 00:01:56,269
a Capuchin priest who
gave away all his possessions.

21
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:02,232
A man who had nothing,
like you.

22
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:03,817
Now what is your name...

23
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:07,111
you ungrateful cur?

24
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,622
Your name, boy!

25
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:26,542
Have you lost your tongue?

26
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:28,460
What is your name?

27
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:37,969
All the girls...

28
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,721
will remain locked
in their dormitory...

29
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:45,099
and no food
will be served to any boy...

30
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:49,853
until you acknowledge
your namesake before God.

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,123
Food! Food! Food!
Food! Food! Food! Food!

32
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,990
Yes. Yes.

33
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:07,746
They should name you
Simon Magus, the magician.

34
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:09,211
No.

35
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:11,708
Simon... Templar.

36
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:24,384
Agnes!

37
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,595
Agnes!

38
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:35,267
Agnes!

39
00:04:45,608 --> 00:04:46,734
Agnes!

40
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,034
When they catch you,
they'll cane you.

41
00:04:57,076 --> 00:04:59,452
Won't happen,
'cause we're leaving tonight...

42
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:02,164
this hearty brotherhood,
on a crusade.

43
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:04,582
That's why I risked everything,
Agnes, my love...

44
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:06,334
to bid you farewell.

45
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,877
I can't leave you behind
without a kiss.

46
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,087
Hey, watch this.

47
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:29,518
We've lost some girls!

48
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,062
The girls are missing!

49
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:34,188
There are girls missing!

50
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,439
Come on, boys!

51
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,823
Wait, John Rossi.
My kiss.

52
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,954
There he is! Get him!

53
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,292
Aah!

54
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:15,763
October 3.

55
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:18,098
Entering foyer
of Tretiak industries.

56
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,768
Heavy security on elevators.
Guards in uniform.

57
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,354
Elevator to vault on 26th floor
requires separate passkey.

58
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:28,814
Maybe use stairs.

59
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,024
No traffic there.

60
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,026
October 4.

61
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,659
Personal tidbits.

62
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:40,323
Tretiak's former partner
died suddenly in 1995.

63
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:43,450
It left Tretiak as sole owner
of a gas and oil empire.

64
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:48,913
Tretiak's first son killed
in car crash five years ago.

65
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:51,873
Who are you?

66
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:54,375
Vehicle was
driven by younger son Ilya...

67
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:55,668
now 27.

68
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,419
Wife now lives in Geneva...

69
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,337
following assassination
attempt in 1996.

70
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,485
I am... Ivanovanovitch.

71
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,591
October 5.

72
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,801
Ilya spent most of today
in Cafe Eldorado...

73
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,969
with bandito buddies.

74
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,180
Gangster rap, coffee,
flirting with teenage girls.

75
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,682
Small firearms in coats.
Machine pistols in cars.

76
00:08:33,952 --> 00:08:36,705
There were
three great empires...

77
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:41,667
that dominated the world both
culturally and militarily...

78
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,213
Rome, Constantinople,
and Russia.

79
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:49,173
All three have fallen.

80
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:52,718
Only one can be restored...

81
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,721
and only one man
can restore it...

82
00:08:56,762 --> 00:08:59,639
Ivan Petrovich Tretiak!

83
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:26,452
Friends...
countrymen...

84
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,286
Russians!

85
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:39,336
You people
here in this room...

86
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,672
are the cream of Russia...

87
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:48,303
and the whole nation
is listening with us.

88
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:51,889
But why do you all
listen to me rave?

89
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,974
Set aside my oil company...

90
00:09:54,015 --> 00:09:56,684
forget about
my best-selling book...

91
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:01,354
and all I am is a lunatic...

92
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:05,190
haunted by the fantasy
of an empire...

93
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:09,610
that reclaims her former might,
her former size.

94
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:19,993
All I am is a poet
spinning rhymes of a Russia...

95
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:25,081
not cut off at the knees,
but armed to the teeth.

96
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:31,210
Not ridiculed, but revered.

97
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:36,214
No! More than revered!

98
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,715
Feared!

99
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:51,726
But who am I
to dazzle you with this dream?

100
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,019
All I've done is...

101
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,063
How does it look
for the leader's son...

102
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,691
to walk out
when the leader speaks?

103
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,192
You'd prefer
the leader's son...

104
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:03,694
to piss his pants on live TV?
Hmm?

105
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:08,740
And still the people
freeze to death!

106
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,713
I love this country.

107
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:45,528
I don't speak Russian.

108
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,238
In that case, stand up...

109
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,198
put your hands
behind your head...

110
00:13:50,782 --> 00:13:53,034
and turn around slowly.

111
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,165
Wrong place for a condom.
Take it off.

112
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:10,214
Listen,
if I give this to you...

113
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,799
you'll give it to your daddy.

114
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:16,468
What's he gonna give you?
Not even a Christmas bonus.

115
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,096
The guy I'm stealing this for
will give me $1 million.

116
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:22,139
If we go in partners,
we'll split 50-50.

117
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:24,641
Half a million hard currency.

118
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:27,352
Think of the drugs you could buy
with that much cake.

119
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:30,813
You'll be discoing
for a decade in Moscow, mate.

120
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:33,149
I don't need your small change.

121
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,775
That's your first problem.

122
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:37,319
Here is your second.

123
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,696
Microchip... please.

124
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,324
Freeze!

125
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,492
Sorry. Guns make me nervous.

126
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,995
Suck me... sideways.

127
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,272
Aah! Uhh!

128
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:28,232
Uh! My eyes! Ohh!

129
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:49,208
Give it up!

130
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,631
You got no place to go!

131
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,434
A goddamn button!

132
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,943
Back of the building!
Come on!

133
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:38,996
Where's the body?

134
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,372
No body.
Just some guy in rags.

135
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,842
As the bitter chill of winter...

136
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:50,635
descends on Moscow...

137
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:53,053
Russians are warming
to the angry rhetoric...

138
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:55,638
of former communist boss
Ivan Tretiak.

139
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,307
Now a billionaire oil magnate...

140
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,350
and leader
of his own political party...

141
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:03,353
Tretiak predicted that the civil
unrest engulfing Russia...

142
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:07,690
will only worsen, unless
Reformist President Karpov...

143
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,525
can overcome
the heating-oil shortage...

144
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:23,869
that has already killed
scores of Russians.

145
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:25,370
What beautiful work.

146
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:36,024
Ah. Cloisonne.

147
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:38,214
It is old.

148
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:40,424
Yes.
It belonged to my grandmother.

149
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:45,594
Please.

150
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:54,476
Tonight I feel like
the oldest person on this plane.

151
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:59,521
My husband, he's sending me
to England to live...

152
00:18:59,563 --> 00:19:01,528
until things change.

153
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:05,401
You are married
not even a year...

154
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,861
and already this bastard
has a girlfriend?!

155
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,201
I am sorry.

156
00:19:10,238 --> 00:19:11,739
It's not my business.

157
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:17,619
How come you know
so much about me?

158
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,955
It is a gift.

159
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:26,126
I'm Martin de Porres.
I am from Spain...

160
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,086
but I'm named
for a Peruvian saint...

161
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:31,255
who could cure
the sick or the injured...

162
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:32,881
by the laying of hands.

163
00:19:45,099 --> 00:19:47,397
Hmm.
He's the same build...

164
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,852
as the description
the Russians gave us...

165
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:51,520
but he doesn't
sound like an Aussie.

166
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:52,730
No.

167
00:19:56,232 --> 00:19:58,150
Could be faking it.

168
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:06,949
X- rays are clear.

169
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:09,576
He hasn't swallowed
the microchip. Anything?

170
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:12,411
You English with
your chips, your fish and chips.

171
00:20:12,453 --> 00:20:13,871
On the airplane, I had chicken.

172
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,081
Van Gogh theft,
Netherlands.

173
00:20:16,122 --> 00:20:18,207
Last year. Same eyes.

174
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,000
Different chin.

175
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,119
Halcyon Hotel, guv.

176
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,799
Stand up!

177
00:21:15,836 --> 00:21:18,087
What is your name?!

178
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,630
Answer the question!

179
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,300
What is your name?! Hey!

180
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,223
Lou, the microchip arrived.

181
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:33,432
I put the dough in your account.

182
00:21:33,474 --> 00:21:35,767
Sorry I didn't get back
to you about that diamond.

183
00:21:35,809 --> 00:21:37,435
Moscow's like Dodge City now.

184
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:40,104
All them greedy Commies have
turned into crazy capitalists.

185
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:42,482
It's disgusting.
It's made 'em sloppy.

186
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,817
One or two more easy scores
like this last one...

187
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,111
- I top 50 mil, I'm quitting.
- I heard that before.

188
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:49,612
Not from me.
I don't know nuttin'.

189
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:51,114
You don't believe me?
Try and find me.

190
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,573
- Fuck you, Lou.
- See yourself.

191
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,537
Can't seem to break 50.

192
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:53,954
"One million U.S. dollars...

193
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:55,539
"nonrefundable...

194
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,420
"reserves you a quiet table...

195
00:22:57,457 --> 00:23:02,878
"at a romantic little spot
in Berlin called Templehopf...

196
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:05,880
"which has
a cozy transit lounge.

197

through the metal detectors...

198
00:23:08,507 --> 00:23:10,842
"and I walk through
the metal detectors.

199
00:23:10,884 --> 00:23:14,970
"Since you know I'm not armed,
and I know you're not armed...

200
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:17,931
"we can both fall in love,
and nobody gets hurt. "

201
00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:32,984
I can't see him.

202
00:23:33,026 --> 00:23:35,527
Then look for him.

203
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:38,697
You have
a long and beautiful cane...

204
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:41,032
along with your beautiful eyes.

205
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:46,286
That photograph
doesn't do you justice.

206
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:47,792
Who are you?

207
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:49,580
My name
is Bruno Hautenfaust.

208
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:52,916
I was named for a saint
who was a very wealthy man.

209
00:23:52,957 --> 00:23:55,084
Had the wine, women, songs...

210
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:58,879
then took a vow of poverty
and became a hermit...

211
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,964
went to live in the forest...
in the nude.

212
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:03,465
Please leave.

213
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:08,012
I represent
the professional you hired.

214
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:10,013
I'm his business manager.

215
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:11,973
I speak for him.

216
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,141
We don't deal
with underlings.

217
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:15,976
Come on, Father. Let's go.

218
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:20,479
Wait. Sit down.
Listen and learn.

219
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,022
Ah. Youth.

220
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,652
Who runs this thief?

221
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:31,821
CIA? Ml-6? Libya?

222
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:33,698
He's not a racecar.
Nobody runs him.

223
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:35,074
He's an independent contractor.

224
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:38,868
Good. Then no one
will mind if I kill him.

225
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,661
Oh, yes.

226
00:24:40,703 --> 00:24:45,373
I can have a man killed
and stroll away like that...

227
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:47,000
even with metal detectors...

228
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:49,418
even in this transit lounge.

229
00:24:51,044 --> 00:24:54,172
Oh, it's so early.

230
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:56,215
You guys wanna get coffee
or something?

231
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,009
Sure.

232
00:25:03,095 --> 00:25:05,019
Be quiet.

233
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:07,432
What is it
you request of my employer?

234
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:09,934
Do you know
what cold fusion is?

235
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,435
Of course.

236
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:13,687
It's the theory...

237
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,355
of nuclear fusion
at room temperature...

238
00:25:16,397 --> 00:25:17,524
free energy forever.

239
00:25:17,566 --> 00:25:18,858
Yes.

240
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,026
Kaffee?

241
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:21,193
Klein, Bitte.

242
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,989
As far as science goes,
it ranks just above astrology.

243
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,908
Those who claim to
have achieved the experiment...

244
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:31,118
have never been able
to duplicate it.

245
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:32,452
Until now.

246
00:25:34,287 --> 00:25:38,373
There is an electrochemist
working at Oxford.

247
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:40,792
We believe
that this good lady...

248
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:43,752
made a breakthrough
in cold fusion.

249
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:47,880
Your employer
will obtain the formula for me.

250
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,717
He's very busy,
and you are very boring.

251
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,557
Your offer must inspire him.

252
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:56,220
This woman
has repeatedly avoided...

253
00:25:56,262 --> 00:26:00,098
my agents' attempts
to find the formula.

254
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,225
She's cagey, difficult.

255
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:05,936
Maybe your agents are stupid.

256
00:26:10,022 --> 00:26:14,109
I think this inspiration would
cost you three million dollars.

257
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,407
Ridiculous.

258
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:21,239
Why? You will have
the world market in energy.

259
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,741
Cost you a nickel
for every million you make.

260
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,075
His deposit should go-

261
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:28,286
Hey. It is not for me.

262
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:29,830
It is for mother Russia.

263
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:33,755
But you want mother Russia,
too, Mr. Tretiak.

264
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,586
Three million in a bank account
in Zurich. Agreed?

265
00:26:39,838 --> 00:26:41,464
Yes.

266
00:26:41,506 --> 00:26:46,801
How long to get
your employer's agreement?

267
00:26:46,843 --> 00:26:48,052
I'll ask.

268
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,107
Your offer has inspired her.

269
00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:06,274
I'll do it.

270
00:27:07,984 --> 00:27:10,236
Bank account number in Zurich.

271
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,113
Auf wiedersehen. Bye, sonny.

272
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:14,948
Bye-bye.

273
00:27:16,449 --> 00:27:20,744
I really love this guy.
Ha ha ha!

274
00:27:23,913 --> 00:27:25,998
Too bad we have to kill him.

275
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,457
Yeah, too bad.

276
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:45,430
When the electrochemists
Pons and Fleischman...

277
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:47,974
announced in 1989...

278
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:51,226
that they had discovered
cold fusion...

279
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:55,563
a revolutionary process
of generating energy...

280
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:59,107
they were at first
acclaimed as geniuses...

281
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,985
and then condemned
as charlatans.

282
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:06,196
The protocols of cold fusion...

283
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:07,656
What are those? Drugs?

284
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:10,825
Could I have one?
My head's pounding.

285
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,993
She's boring the life
out of me.

286
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:16,913
- They're for my heart.
- Oh.

287
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,374
You have very pretty eyes.
You're a pretty lady.

288
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,840
- Who are you?
- Me?

289
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,420
I'm here to do an interview
with that Dr. Russell.

290
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:29,172
I'm gonna expose her as a fraud.

291
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:32,174
You don't put any stock in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

292
00:28:32,216 --> 00:28:34,343
- Actually, I do.
- Really?

293
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:37,595
Dr. Emma Russell.

294
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:45,976
Oops.

295
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:56,152
Well, I didn't prepare
any formal remarks.

296
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,153
I'm actually more interested...

297
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:01,698
in what questions you all have
about cold fusion...

298
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,866
so I thought we would
start with those.

299
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,993
Any questions?

300
00:29:08,286 --> 00:29:09,412
Please?

301
00:29:09,454 --> 00:29:10,955
I have, Dr. Russell.

302
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:15,208
Can you explain
the actual process of fusion...

303
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,876
you know, the theory?

304
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:19,753
Yes. Oh, there it is.

305
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:23,798
This is the-the apparatus.

306
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,216
And very simply...

307
00:29:25,257 --> 00:29:28,510
when positively charged
deuterons...

308
00:29:28,552 --> 00:29:31,512
are attracted
to the palladium cathode...

309
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:33,013
they cram together...

310
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:36,599
and there are millions of them
inside the cathode...

311
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:40,019
getting closer and closer,
and then they fuse...

312
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,229
and they create energy
in the form of helium.

313
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,855
But I read somewhere...

314
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:45,648
that the experiment
couldn't be replicated...

315
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,484
so how do we know it works?

316
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:51,694
We don't.

317
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:52,903
Not yet.

318
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,906
But if you remember Einstein...

319
00:29:55,947 --> 00:29:59,075
he knew the theory
of relativity to be true...

320
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:00,326
long before he could prove it.

321
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:01,499
I mean, he felt the truth.

322
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:06,373
And, uh, some of us
feel the same way...

323
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:07,624
about cold fusion...

324
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:10,126
because it's there.
It's in nature...

325
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:14,921
the raw, natural power
just waiting to be harnessed.

326
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:19,383
When we ignite
that cold fusion fire...

327
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:21,718
I mean, just imagine.

328
00:30:22,844 --> 00:30:26,889
There's more energy
in one cubic mile of seawater...

329
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,766
than in all the known
oil reserves on earth.

330
00:30:29,808 --> 00:30:33,894
I mean, you could drive
your car 55 million miles...

331
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:36,396
on a gallon of heavy water.

332
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:39,315
It would be the end
of pollution...

333
00:30:39,357 --> 00:30:41,900
warmth for the whole world.

334
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:47,321
So why don't I demonstrate
for you...

335
00:30:47,363 --> 00:30:51,115
why other people in the past
have been so unsuccessful?

336
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:54,493
They used very complex...

337
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:58,663
November 17, 11:30 a. m.

338
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:01,332
Entering flat
of Dr. Emma Russell.

339
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:02,624
High Street, Oxford.

340
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,711
No alarms on outer doors.
Strange.

341
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,379
No messages.

342
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,092
Shelley Monument.

343
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:19,346
Entering bathroom.

344
00:31:20,097 --> 00:31:21,598
Books.

345
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:25,309
More books.

346
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,898
Walls covered
with reminder notes.

347
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:35,150
Poetry.

348
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:50,829
Ah. Dad.

349
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,022
"Stop and talk to Shelley
every day.

350
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:28,650
"How can I love
a man named Percy?"

351
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:34,530
"Isn't there
someone in the world...

352
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:36,615
"who can consume me like that. "

353
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:39,909
Magic. Romantic.

354
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:49,166
No recent applications.

355
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:51,251
"Cold fusion notes. "

356
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,886
"Although I pass the
Shelley Monument every day...

357
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:07,263
"its sadness strikes me
every time. "

358
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:11,808
"I feel a very personal loss
when I look at it.

359
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,893
"So much pain
and so much passion. "

360
00:33:19,355 --> 00:33:21,941
"To give light to them
that sit in darkness...

361
00:33:21,982 --> 00:33:23,484
"and in the shadow of death. "

362
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:28,070
"Luke 1; verse 79."

363
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:31,114
Tretiak's wrong.
She's not cagey.

364
00:33:32,282 --> 00:33:35,243
She's not difficult.
She's just...

365
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:36,577
eccentric.

366
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:39,330
She's innocent.

367
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:47,086
Maybe it's in her head.

368
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:52,465
She needs a poet...
an artist...

369
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,968
someone who...

370
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:58,803
understands truth.

371
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,185
She needs Thomas More.

372
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,473
Do you like it?

373
00:34:58,725 --> 00:34:59,767
What?

374
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:03,020
The sculpture. Do you like it?

375
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:08,024
Oh... yes.

376
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,983
What do you love about it?

377
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:25,037
The way it... glows.

378
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:28,998
And how the light...

379
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,667
holds him in silence...

380
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:34,836
taking care of him.

381
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:39,131
That's what I like about it.

382
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:44,218
Are you an artist?

383
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,805
No. I'm just a traveler
searching for purity.

384
00:35:50,765 --> 00:35:53,558
- What do you search for?
- Energy.

385
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,518
Yes.

386
00:35:58,187 --> 00:36:01,147
Have you ever been
on a long journey?

387
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:02,983
No, not really.

388
00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:08,487
Perhaps I'll take you
to my home...

389
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:10,739
in Africa.

390
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:13,366
You should
experience the energy...

391
00:36:13,408 --> 00:36:15,201
of where all life began.

392
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,166
Sorry.
I'm not very good with people.

393
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:30,087
Me, neither.

394
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,444
"I see my angel
for the first time...

395
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,614
"know my purpose,
feel my birth... "

396
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:09,492
"hear, at first faintly,
then distinctly...

397
00:37:09,534 --> 00:37:11,994
"the sweet strains
of our union... "

398
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:16,791
"Our love heats up
the cold universe...

399
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:19,668
"and gives my tired,
desperate hope... "

400
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:22,587
"purified
by our kisses...

401
00:37:22,628 --> 00:37:25,422
"are eternally healed. "

402
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,388
Do you like it?

403
00:37:28,424 --> 00:37:30,759
Who did you write it for?

404
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,303
You.

405
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:36,889
You're following me,
or it's destiny.

406
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:39,474
Either way, it's weird.

407
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:41,059
Very weird.

408
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,187
Destiny then.

409
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,905
This must look strange.

410
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:00,907
It's, uh...

411
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,035
something that I'm working on...

412
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:05,786
a formula for...

413
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:09,039
creating energy.

414
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,791
That you carry around
in your underwear?

415
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,836
Yeah, I do.

416
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:31,640
How did you do that?

417
00:38:33,642 --> 00:38:35,810
Magic.

418
00:38:35,852 --> 00:38:37,603
Give it back.

419
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:39,188
It looks like Sanskrit.

420
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:41,189
Give it back.

421
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:46,610
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to watch you put it away.

422
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:51,072
What else do you keep in there?

423
00:38:51,906 --> 00:38:53,032
Nothing.

424
00:38:53,073 --> 00:38:54,491
That's not true.

425
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:58,994
Can I get you
anything else?

426
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:05,750
Drink your wine.
Latour '57.

427
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:10,962
The Latour, sir,
is $400 a bottle.

428
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,425
Then we'll have two bottles.

429
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,512
There. You count it.

430
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:32,270
All these little tubes
and microbes and things.

431
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:33,687
Molecules?

432
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:35,856
Those, too.

433
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:38,567
Can I tell you something?

434
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,652
What? You must. Everything.

435
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:43,237
It's a secret.

436
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:44,447
What?

437
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:47,949
I'm done.

438
00:39:50,618 --> 00:39:53,871
My energy research-
I'm finished.

439
00:39:53,912 --> 00:39:57,332
I still have some sequencing
that I have to work out...

440
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:00,584
to make sure that it's safe,
but I did it.

441
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:05,421
It's just been you against
the whole world, hasn't it?

442
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:08,131
How have you done it
and stayed so positive?

443
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,883
The gift of faith.

444
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:14,011
To see...

445
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:16,805
Well...

446
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:20,474
to believe in something
that's all around us...

447
00:40:21,517 --> 00:40:24,644
but hidden from our sight.

448
00:40:25,395 --> 00:40:27,229
That's a beautiful thought.

449
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:29,356
I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

450
00:40:31,024 --> 00:40:33,609
I don't even know your name.

451
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:35,194
Well, my name is...

452
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:38,404
I don't want to tell you.

453
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:40,573
I don't want to do that.

454
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:45,201
I don't want to do that.
What difference does it make?

455
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,747
What's your name?

456
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,333
- Emma.
- Emma.

457
00:40:52,374 --> 00:40:55,127
Now I know
everything about you.

458
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:59,088
Your... genius.

459
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:02,924
You have a weak heart.

460
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:10,680
You have beautiful dreams,
great courage.

461
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:14,391
You're not afraid in this world.

462
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,393
You get that from your father.

463
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,272
You can't cook
to save your life...

464
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,815
and you love fish.

465
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,943
I do love fish.

466
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,279
That's weird.

467
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:32,947
I want to try that.

468
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:34,573
- No.
- Yes.

469
00:41:34,615 --> 00:41:36,617
I don't want you to.
Drink your wine.

470
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:40,328
Yes, I do.

471
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:42,996
What's your name?

472
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:47,083
My name is Thomas More.

473
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,752
I was named after the saint...

474
00:41:52,295 --> 00:41:55,673
who died for his faith.

475
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:58,717
OK.

476
00:42:01,261 --> 00:42:02,471
Your work...

477
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:07,141
is very dangerous...
and alive...

478
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,602
and I love your poems.

479
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:12,812
They move me.

480
00:42:14,605 --> 00:42:16,481
But that's not
who you really are.

481
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:19,942
You're running away from...

482
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:23,737
your past and your pain...

483
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:28,073
and yet you keep it
so close to you.

484
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,537
So you don't have to be afraid
of who you are...

485
00:42:36,705 --> 00:42:38,623
because you're beautiful.

486
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:38,795
What are you doing?

487
00:43:56,475 --> 00:44:01,521
Oh, my God,
you're bleeding. What happened?

488
00:44:01,562 --> 00:44:03,814
Don't know. I was...

489
00:44:03,856 --> 00:44:07,067
weeping, and I slipped.

490
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:09,527
I was thinking of you.
I don't know.

491
00:44:09,568 --> 00:44:11,820
I live right down the street.

492
00:44:11,862 --> 00:44:13,613
I could clean you up.

493
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:16,907
Why do you cover your mouth
when you laugh?

494
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,242
- I don't know.
- Wait.

495
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,372
I'm glad it stopped bleeding.

496
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:27,833
Don't need stitches.

497
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,633
We're gonna have
to disinfect it, though.

498
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:40,260
You really are an angel.

499
00:44:40,301 --> 00:44:41,510
You are.

500
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:46,764
It's gonna hurt.

501
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,141
- Aah!
- Aah!

502
00:44:48,182 --> 00:44:50,225
Oh, sorry.

503
00:44:52,435 --> 00:44:55,396
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

504
00:44:55,438 --> 00:44:57,356
Yeah.

505
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:59,316
I'm sorry. I was just joking.

506
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:02,443
I...

507
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:04,611
- I should go.
- Oh, no.

508
00:45:04,653 --> 00:45:07,113
Yes. You-you... I...

509
00:45:08,156 --> 00:45:10,241
Take off your pants.

510
00:45:10,282 --> 00:45:11,450
Pardon?

511
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:13,076
I mean, your sweater.

512
00:45:16,662 --> 00:45:19,665
There's blood on it.
I'll wash it.

513
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:26,044
Very domestic.

514
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,340
There's blood
on your blouse as well.

515
00:45:33,675 --> 00:45:35,302
I'll wash it.

516
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,273
Do you have any wine?

517
00:46:03,032 --> 00:46:08,828
I'm so overwhelmed
that you even noticed me.

518
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,371
How could I not?

519
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,749
You make me feel so good.

520
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,958
I wish you...

521
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,628
I wish you could understand.

522
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:24,382
I want you to know who I am.

523
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:42,687
Oh, my heart.

524
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:46,233
Don't disappear.
I'll be right back.

525
00:46:46,274 --> 00:46:49,110
Calm it down.

526
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,778
Bring it round.

527
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,823
Too way high up, your street.

528
00:46:57,575 --> 00:47:00,619
I can see...

529
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,246
like nothin' else...

530
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:06,832
in me, you're better
than I wanna be.

531
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:13,879
Don't think,
'cause I understand...

532
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,713
I care...

533
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:18,257
Don't think,
'cause I'm talking...

534
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:21,009
Oh, I can't do this.

535
00:47:21,051 --> 00:47:22,302
She's so great.

536
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:23,761
I can't believe this.

537
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:26,346
I can't believe
this is happening.

538
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:30,105
I'm open...

539
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:33,143
to falling from grace.

540
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,326
Hi.

541
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:13,258
"To spider:

542
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:16,052
"Must fly. Have better offer. "

543
00:48:16,844 --> 00:48:19,346
Greedy westerner.
Wants more money.

544
00:48:19,388 --> 00:48:20,639
Who cares?

545
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:23,683
Can't spend hard currency
in hell.

546
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:27,561
Send this message-

547
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:30,938
"Fly, don't buzz off.

548
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:34,524
"I'll double your fee...

549
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,321
"or send my own boys
to take care of the woman. "

550
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:49,995
You OK?

551
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:56,791
Let's...
let's just lie here.

552
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,670
Can't we just
be like this tonight?

553
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:05,715
Is that what you want?

554
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:08,258
It's so magic.

555
00:49:14,306 --> 00:49:16,140
It just feels so perfect.

556
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:49,749
It's 7:00 a. m.,
and here are the news headlines.

557
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,299
Thomas?

558
00:51:16,984 --> 00:51:19,611
Lev Naumovitch,
it's here! Good man!

559
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:21,117
It's revolutionary, sir!

560
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:24,239
She's boldly cast aside
a slew of stale ideas...

561
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:26,824
but I think the formula
is incomplete.

562
00:51:26,866 --> 00:51:27,992
It will take months...

563
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:29,285
That won't do...

564
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:32,329
because now that the people are
nicely beginning to freeze...

565
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:36,083
Tretiak must sweep in
with a miracle to save them.

566
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:38,459
How high do you want it,
Mr. Tretiak?

567
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:40,961
To the top.
Good morning, Yuri.

568
00:51:41,003 --> 00:51:42,296
Good morning.

569
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:45,381
Perhaps I
can confirm the validity...

570
00:51:45,423 --> 00:51:48,133
of this formula more quickly
if I dispense...

571
00:51:48,175 --> 00:51:51,136
with certain protocols.
But, Mr. Tretiak-

572
00:51:51,177 --> 00:51:53,346
How long, Dr. Botvin,
since you received...

573
00:51:53,387 --> 00:51:57,224
your last salary check
from Moscow University?

574
00:51:57,265 --> 00:52:00,226
Ukrainian Independence Day.

575
00:52:01,894 --> 00:52:03,061
Last August.

576
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:07,940
Ivan, he's on-line.

577
00:52:10,025 --> 00:52:11,151
Do it.

578
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:15,738
To spider...

579
00:52:18,115 --> 00:52:19,741
You've got the recipe.

580
00:52:19,782 --> 00:52:21,033
"Where's my dough?"

581
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,160
To human fly...

582
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:27,789
Recipe incomplete.

583
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,832
The cake won't rise.

584
00:52:29,873 --> 00:52:32,876
Hence, no dough.

585
00:52:39,297 --> 00:52:41,632
I am not the baker...

586
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:44,302
"... but don't make me
the butcher. "

587
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,389
I like this guy.

588
00:52:52,558 --> 00:52:55,602
No play, no pay.

589
00:52:55,644 --> 00:52:59,272
I'm certain you kept
the cookbook.

590
00:53:07,903 --> 00:53:09,029
Holland Park.

591
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:26,376
I'll check that for you.

592
00:53:26,418 --> 00:53:29,545
Yes, that seems to be fine.
One moment. Aah!

593
00:53:38,844 --> 00:53:40,553
He's keeping me on-line.

594
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,687
You wait here.

595
00:54:35,013 --> 00:54:37,765
You, beside the car.

596
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,727
Now, turn around.
Step away from the vehicle.

597
00:54:42,768 --> 00:54:43,936
He's armed!

598
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:08,581
Drive!

599
00:55:18,213 --> 00:55:20,673
Go the other way. Go!

600
00:55:25,594 --> 00:55:27,887
You're all I've got tonight.

601
00:55:29,347 --> 00:55:31,932
You're all I've got tonight.

602
00:55:34,184 --> 00:55:35,518
What about him?

603
00:55:44,191 --> 00:55:45,776
What about this one?

604
00:55:50,488 --> 00:55:52,865
Yeah. That-

605
00:55:52,906 --> 00:55:56,200
We believe
they're all the same villain.

606
00:56:00,996 --> 00:56:02,455
Oh, my God.

607
00:56:04,498 --> 00:56:06,708
They're all him?

608
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,460
We believe so.

609
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:11,462
He eluded a hit squad
this morning in Holland Park.

610
00:56:13,755 --> 00:56:16,257
Then he fled the U.K.
out of Heathrow.

611
00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:18,092
We've got a handful
of false identities...

612
00:56:18,134 --> 00:56:21,638
used on visas,
passports, leases...

613
00:56:22,888 --> 00:56:24,640
Nicholas Owen...

614
00:56:24,676 --> 00:56:26,391
Louie Guanella...

615
00:56:26,433 --> 00:56:27,642
Peter Damian...

616
00:56:29,102 --> 00:56:31,353
Charles Borroneo.

617
00:56:31,395 --> 00:56:33,939
Of course.

618
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,774
Thomas More.

619
00:56:36,816 --> 00:56:38,901
All names of Catholic saints.

620
00:56:42,403 --> 00:56:44,905
Can you access
Heathrow's passenger lists...

621
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:48,033
for the last eight hours?

622
00:56:48,658 --> 00:56:50,326
I think it might be possible.

623
00:56:50,368 --> 00:56:51,535
Good.

624
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,876
Go!

625
00:57:19,432 --> 00:57:20,557
Yeah!

626
00:57:32,317 --> 00:57:33,485
Yes!

627
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:46,787
See, my friends...

628
00:57:47,537 --> 00:57:50,623
you back the biggest rats.

629
00:58:11,806 --> 00:58:12,973
Hello.

630
00:58:17,018 --> 00:58:18,561
Out, out.

631
00:58:18,644 --> 00:58:21,068
Freeloaders, out.

632
00:58:21,105 --> 00:58:22,772
I want to drink alone.

633
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:24,107
Close the curtain.

634
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,418
- What?
- What?

635
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,963
Don't look down.

636
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:54,923
You know who I am?

637
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,300
No.

638
00:58:57,342 --> 00:59:01,094
I'm the thief
you tried to cheat.

639
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:04,097
This is your accountant.

640
00:59:06,432 --> 00:59:07,933
Talk to him.

641
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:13,229
The phone goes
the other way, you moron.

642
00:59:16,898 --> 00:59:18,524
Hello.

643
00:59:18,566 --> 00:59:20,234
Tretiak speaking.

644
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:25,696
That money to Zurich,
send it now.

645
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:27,281
I said now.

646
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,075
Yeah.

647
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:33,869
Thank you.

648
00:59:34,912 --> 00:59:38,790
You know what the hardest part
about being you is?

649
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:41,458
Pretending to be so bad in bed.

650
00:59:43,418 --> 00:59:45,712
You son of the bitch.

651
00:59:46,462 --> 00:59:48,922
There is an impostor.
Get him out.

652
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:51,549
Hey, hey, hey!

653
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:55,303
Take your hands off me,
you idiots!

654
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:57,722
Are you crazy? It's me.

655
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:58,931
Go, go!

656
00:59:58,973 --> 01:00:00,312
Catch him, go!

657
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:02,309
Ilya, get the bastard!

658
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:27,536
Fifty million. I'm out.

659
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,123
Mr. Ferrer checking out.

660
01:00:32,165 --> 01:00:34,792
OK.

661
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,176
I'll have one, too.

662
01:00:47,802 --> 01:00:48,928
Emma.

663
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:50,887
Hi.

664
01:00:51,888 --> 01:00:54,599
I'm... I'm overwhelmed.

665
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:57,559
You found me.

666
01:00:57,601 --> 01:00:59,269
Wasn't very hard.

667
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:04,314
Two men with saint's names
flew into Moscow yesterday.

668
01:01:04,356 --> 01:01:08,443
Isadore Bakanja
is a short, bald African...

669
01:01:08,485 --> 01:01:10,987
whereas Vincent Ferrer-

670
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:13,155
Named after a saint
who betrayed his best friend.

671
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:15,157
How could you do it?

672
01:01:15,657 --> 01:01:17,617
Emma...

673
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:20,369
I- I had to.

674
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:22,996
I'm a thief.

675
01:01:23,038 --> 01:01:25,039
I want my cards back.

676
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,083
You flew all this way
for your cards?

677
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:28,250
Yes, I did.

678
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,961
No.
It's because you're in love.

679
01:01:34,755 --> 01:01:36,048
I rest my case.

680
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,924
Who are you?

681
01:01:37,966 --> 01:01:41,135
No one has a clue,
least of all me.

682
01:01:41,177 --> 01:01:44,971
And why would you
steal cold fusion?

683
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:48,349
It's free.
Why would you do that?

684
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:52,227
Eight million reasons.

685
01:01:52,269 --> 01:01:54,979
Eight million.
Wow. That's all?

686
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:00,233
I would have
given them to you...

687
01:02:00,275 --> 01:02:02,151
if you'd only asked.

688
01:02:08,573 --> 01:02:09,949
You've got
to get away from me.

689
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:13,451
I'm not going until you tell me
why you lied to me.

690
01:02:13,493 --> 01:02:16,078
- You lied to me.
- I lied to you?

691
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,665
You almost got me killed.
The guy says it doesn't work.

692
01:02:18,706 --> 01:02:20,499
Well, screw him.

693
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,834
I don't think you'd enjoy that.

694
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:24,836
You're right.
I don't think I would.

695
01:02:32,509 --> 01:02:35,636
Emma, you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

696
01:02:37,304 --> 01:02:38,763
What?

697
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,230
- They took my pills.
- No, they didn't.

698
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:51,356
I palmed them from your purse.

699
01:02:51,398 --> 01:02:53,608
I need one or two.

700
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:56,819
I need...
I have a bad heart.

701
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,029
- I know.
- It's starting to pound.

702
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:00,714
It's OK. I've got your pills.

703
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:03,601
OK, I've got two in my hand.

704
01:03:03,637 --> 01:03:06,451
I'm gonna pass out.

705
01:03:06,493 --> 01:03:08,369
Sit down on the floor.

706
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:13,206
Just get down on the floor.
That's right.

707
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,083
That's right.
Eat two out of my hand.

708
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:18,669
That's right. OK?

709
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,171
While you're down there...

710
01:03:23,923 --> 01:03:25,883
Get the pocketknife
out of my boot.

711
01:03:28,551 --> 01:03:32,389
This formula makes
certain assumptions...

712
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:36,809
which contradict all we know
about cold fusion cathodes...

713
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,102
so testing at any level
becomes futile...

714
01:03:39,144 --> 01:03:42,855
without further information,
Mr. Tretiak.

715
01:03:42,897 --> 01:03:45,690
Don't despair, Dr. Botvin.

716
01:03:45,732 --> 01:03:47,191
Help is here.

717
01:03:58,825 --> 01:04:00,618
The two came very quietly.

718
01:04:02,995 --> 01:04:04,204
Oh.

719
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:12,252
And they left even more quietly.

720
01:04:14,004 --> 01:04:15,421
Close the city.

721
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,675
Kill him, and bring her... alive.

722
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:37,772
Why are they after me?

723
01:04:37,813 --> 01:04:42,109
Tretiak, the guy I work for...
he owns this city, cops and all.

724
01:04:42,151 --> 01:04:46,446
We have to convince him there's
nothing more he wants from you.

725
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,573
What do you want from me?

726
01:04:54,702 --> 01:04:58,247
- Everything's on those cards?
- Yes.

727
01:04:58,288 --> 01:04:59,789
So the formula works?

728
01:04:59,831 --> 01:05:02,416
Oh, kiss me again.

729
01:05:04,793 --> 01:05:06,258
- No.
- Make up your mind.

730
01:05:06,294 --> 01:05:11,548
Oh, it's-I have to
figure out the order...

731
01:05:11,590 --> 01:05:14,384
before the formula works,
and I'm not giving it to him.

732
01:05:14,426 --> 01:05:16,511
- Tretiak will find you.
- No.

733
01:05:16,552 --> 01:05:19,054
He found me,
and that's hard to do.

734
01:05:19,096 --> 01:05:23,224
- I found you.
- Yes, you did.

735
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:24,600
What do you need?

736
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:31,147
I need some time...

737
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:32,481
and I need...

738
01:05:34,816 --> 01:05:37,777
I need a place to work...

739
01:05:37,818 --> 01:05:39,445
and...

740
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:42,739
Where's everyone going?

741
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:46,158
To their country
relatives to cut firewood.

742
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,909
There's no heat in the city.

743
01:05:58,127 --> 01:06:00,253
How long will it take you
to finish the formula?

744
01:06:00,295 --> 01:06:01,921
I don't know.

745
01:06:01,963 --> 01:06:05,174
Two hours, maybe.
I don't know.

746
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:07,884
Should be enough time to get
our passports together...

747
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,886
and for us to get married.

748
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:13,638
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

749
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:18,100
I want you to be
Mrs. Martin de Porres.

750
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,438
- You're not Martin.
- No.

751
01:06:25,939 --> 01:06:27,149
Who are you?

752
01:06:30,651 --> 01:06:32,111
I don't have a name.

753
01:06:33,737 --> 01:06:34,988
That's sad.

754
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,407
Will you have a name
when we get home?

755
01:06:37,448 --> 01:06:39,366
I don't have a home.

756
01:06:39,408 --> 01:06:41,159
When we get back...

757
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:43,494
you do the science,
I'll do the math.

758
01:06:43,536 --> 01:06:45,288
We'll market your formula
around the world.

759
01:06:45,871 --> 01:06:48,582
We'll make a fortune,
and then...

760
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:51,501
we'll see.

761
01:06:52,918 --> 01:06:54,628
OK?

762
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:04,553
Emma!

763
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:24,193
No trouble, OK?

764
01:07:27,738 --> 01:07:31,073
If you want to live,
never leave my side.

765
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:20,404
Ohh!

766
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,252
Spice room, sun room...

767
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,420
Shadow room, night...

768
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,673
I've got you.

769
01:09:45,178 --> 01:09:46,762
Come on.

770
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:53,017
Here we go. Up.

771
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,188
We've gotta get you warm.

772
01:10:07,194 --> 01:10:09,029
We're almost there.

773
01:10:33,131 --> 01:10:34,340
Come on.

774
01:10:35,716 --> 01:10:37,676
Come on.

775
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:46,225
You'll wait till Christ
comes to Moscow.

776
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:48,977
Elevator was made of mahogany.

777
01:10:49,019 --> 01:10:51,187
Tenants used it
for firewood last winter.

778
01:10:51,229 --> 01:10:52,814
We need your help.

779
01:10:52,855 --> 01:10:55,649
He fell in the river,
and he's freezing.

780
01:10:55,691 --> 01:10:57,400
- Need clothes.
- We're just people-

781
01:10:57,442 --> 01:11:01,904
You're not people.
You're Americans.

782
01:11:01,946 --> 01:11:05,198
Yes, but we ran into trouble
with your Mafia.

783
01:11:37,347 --> 01:11:41,934
She disapproves of what I do,
but eats the bread it buys her.

784
01:11:43,936 --> 01:11:46,146
No heat for sale...

785
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:48,106
but these clothes
will make him warm.

786
01:11:53,569 --> 01:11:56,196
I tell her, Mashenka,
go back to bed.

787
01:11:56,238 --> 01:11:58,323
She's always puttering around.

788
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:06,120
It's here.
Built to escape Secret Police.

789
01:12:06,162 --> 01:12:07,663
In you go.

790
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:24,760
You've got hypothermia.

791
01:12:24,801 --> 01:12:27,303
We have to get
these wet clothes off...

792
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:29,847
keep you warm.

793
01:12:30,723 --> 01:12:32,974
They must be in
one of these buildings.

794
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:34,684
Check every apartment.

795
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,813
How you doing? Talk to me.

796
01:12:39,854 --> 01:12:42,690
Snug as a bug in a rug.

797
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:54,199
OK. We're gonna...

798
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,285
We're gonna have to do this
before your body temperature...

799
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:01,287
falls below 95 degrees.

800
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:17,051
Two kids
talking about foreigners.

801
01:13:25,974 --> 01:13:27,684
Listen to me, tenants!

802
01:13:28,559 --> 01:13:30,811
Show me where
the Americans are...

803
01:13:30,853 --> 01:13:34,856
and you'll be paid
in American dollars.

804
01:13:34,897 --> 01:13:37,274
Five hundred bucks reward.

805
01:13:37,311 --> 01:13:38,525
Daddy...

806
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:43,321
have you seen, by chance,
two Americans?

807
01:13:43,362 --> 01:13:46,156
Just one American
and one polar bear.

808
01:13:48,074 --> 01:13:49,951
Do we get 250?

809
01:14:09,716 --> 01:14:10,883
We check upstairs.

810
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,811
What's your name?

811
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:29,690
Who are you really?

812
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:32,901
Simon.

813
01:14:32,943 --> 01:14:34,194
Simon?

814
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:38,238
So you are named for a saint.

815
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,115
No, Simon the magician.

816
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:43,159
I did tricks...

817
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,787
tricks for Agnes...
and that's how I got things.

818
01:14:46,828 --> 01:14:50,831
Priests took everything,
took Agnes.

819
01:14:50,873 --> 01:14:52,958
Dogs too big.

820
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,085
Teeth. Teeth.

821
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,920
She fell.

822
01:14:57,962 --> 01:14:59,338
I escaped.

823
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:01,965
I always escape.

824
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:05,843
I don't believe in magic
anymore.

825
01:15:07,511 --> 01:15:08,845
I do.

826
01:15:11,514 --> 01:15:14,224
I've never felt
like this before.

827
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:16,601
How?

828
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:19,562
I'm freezing.

829
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,942
These are here!

830
01:15:33,073 --> 01:15:35,992
We gotta get out of here.
Are you OK?

831
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:38,202
They're coming.

832
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:41,913
Americans are here!

833
01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,373
Hurry. Here, put this on.

834
01:15:50,211 --> 01:15:51,378
Ilya!

835
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:06,307
Upstairs. Go!

836
01:16:24,362 --> 01:16:25,946
Maybe we can jump.

837
01:16:27,072 --> 01:16:28,615
Let's jump.

838
01:16:32,743 --> 01:16:34,578
Come on.

839
01:17:00,265 --> 01:17:01,475
Wait.

840
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:20,322
We need her alive, idiot.

841
01:17:22,908 --> 01:17:24,617
Embassy's east of here.

842
01:17:43,965 --> 01:17:45,842
You're late.
Where have you been?

843
01:17:46,634 --> 01:17:48,345
I've been waiting two hours.

844
01:17:48,386 --> 01:17:52,056
I've got some beautiful
paintings for you to buy.

845
01:17:52,098 --> 01:17:53,640
In here. Come on.

846
01:17:58,644 --> 01:18:01,938
Don't fret.
It's just my curator, Toli.

847
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,690
I am Alexa Frankievitch,
but being you're Americans...

848
01:18:04,732 --> 01:18:06,609
you can call me Frankie.

849
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,735
OK, Frankie.
I've got money. We want-

850
01:18:08,777 --> 01:18:12,780
I know. The icon
of the Virgin of the Damned.

851
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:15,282
- Are those maps of the tunnels?
- Yes.

852
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:18,117
We're not here to buy art.
Take us to the American Embassy.

853
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,245
Right.
I need $10,000 up-front.

854
01:18:21,286 --> 01:18:23,627
No.

855
01:18:23,663 --> 01:18:27,208
OK. 7,000 and not a penny less.

856
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:28,709
Shh.

857
01:18:36,298 --> 01:18:37,799
Police.

858
01:18:37,841 --> 01:18:39,884
No. Tretiak's goons.

859
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,225
Wait.

860
01:18:50,267 --> 01:18:53,269
Sasha,
go east to the embassy.

861
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,312
- Are we lost?
- What's wrong?

862
01:18:55,354 --> 01:18:58,690
You're in Russia, sir.
Everything is complicated.

863
01:18:58,726 --> 01:18:59,816
But you know the way?

864
01:18:59,942 --> 01:19:03,528
Like the face
of a Bulgari chronograph.

865
01:19:13,827 --> 01:19:15,746
I remember. This way.

866
01:19:20,124 --> 01:19:22,876
At last. Water main.

867
01:19:23,668 --> 01:19:25,962
They shut it down
each afternoon in winter.

868
01:19:26,003 --> 01:19:27,630
What time do they
turn it back on?

869
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:31,091
You have five minutes,
plus or minus.

870
01:19:31,132 --> 01:19:32,258
Plus or minus?

871
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,724
That means several
minutes earlier or later.

872
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,929
Don't worry.
Third opening is your embassy.

873
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:58,028
Quick. Someone's coming.

874
01:20:03,824 --> 01:20:06,409
Come on. Come on.

875
01:20:14,208 --> 01:20:16,251
Here's the second one.

876
01:20:16,293 --> 01:20:18,086
Embassy's next.

877
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:25,466
- About two more minutes.
- Yeah. Unless it's minus.

878
01:20:29,303 --> 01:20:32,013
Damn.
It's sealed.

879
01:20:33,556 --> 01:20:35,349
We'll have to go back.

880
01:20:35,391 --> 01:20:36,600
Come on.

881
01:21:00,576 --> 01:21:01,827
Hurry.

882
01:21:11,918 --> 01:21:13,962
Up you go.

883
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:36,563
Yankee, go home!
Down with Yankee!

884
01:21:44,403 --> 01:21:47,697
Embassy's only
about 100 yards away.

885
01:21:47,738 --> 01:21:51,325
There's a car right above us.
Watch your head.

886
01:22:24,683 --> 01:22:26,685
I'll create a diversion.

887
01:22:26,726 --> 01:22:29,520
It should take you 10 seconds
to run to those gates.

888
01:22:29,562 --> 01:22:31,522
They'll open them
when they see you coming.

889
01:22:32,439 --> 01:22:34,190
OK. I can do that.

890
01:22:34,232 --> 01:22:36,360
You can do it.

891
01:22:36,402 --> 01:22:40,405
Wait. When am I gonna see you?

892
01:22:40,446 --> 01:22:42,448
I'll find you. You found me.

893
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,157
Yeah, I did.

894
01:23:14,472 --> 01:23:15,640
Aah!

895
01:23:46,998 --> 01:23:50,501
I'm an American!
Open the gate!

896
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:53,086
Open the gate!
I'm an American!

897
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:56,005
Back off from the gate.

898
01:23:56,047 --> 01:23:59,007
Back off. I said back off.

899
01:24:00,133 --> 01:24:03,552
Stand back from the gate.

900
01:24:05,262 --> 01:24:06,763
I said back off!

901
01:24:19,773 --> 01:24:21,274
She outran you?

902
01:24:21,316 --> 01:24:23,359
How humiliating.

903
01:24:27,237 --> 01:24:30,489
One... shot left.

904
01:24:32,157 --> 01:24:34,201
Can't come
all the way to Russia...

905
01:24:34,242 --> 01:24:37,036
and not play Russian roulette.

906
01:24:37,078 --> 01:24:39,330
Before you shoot me,
want to know where the money is?

907
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:42,707
Whose money?

908
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:44,375
Tretiak's, yours.

909
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:46,877
He treats you like dirt.
You could have it all.

910
01:24:46,919 --> 01:24:48,462
What are you saying?

911
01:24:48,503 --> 01:24:50,713
I'm saying your father
stashed billions...

912
01:24:50,755 --> 01:24:53,757
and I know where it's hidden.
Let's make a deal.

913
01:24:53,799 --> 01:24:57,468
So... where are all those
hidden billions?

914
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:02,140
I know... but I don't think
I'm gonna tell you.

915
01:25:31,954 --> 01:25:34,831
Joseph, what's the holdup?
I said get 'em inside!

916
01:25:34,873 --> 01:25:36,833
You're worse
than all the others.

917
01:25:36,874 --> 01:25:39,585
However, burns will heal.

918
01:25:39,627 --> 01:25:42,295
Maybe a little chance
of scarring, perhaps...

919
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:45,714
but all in all,
I'd say he's a very lucky boy.

920
01:25:45,751 --> 01:25:48,091
Lucky? Look at me.

921
01:25:49,009 --> 01:25:51,677
I am a damn devil.

922
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:53,262
Christ.

923
01:25:56,556 --> 01:25:57,682
Yes?

924
01:25:57,724 --> 01:26:00,851
I have run every test
on this cold fusion formula...

925
01:26:00,893 --> 01:26:05,438
and must conclude
it is not merely incomplete...

926
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,773
but rather... impossible.

927
01:26:07,815 --> 01:26:11,610
You may as well try to create
perpetual motion.

928
01:26:12,569 --> 01:26:15,405
I invest millions...

929
01:26:16,614 --> 01:26:19,575
and you can't make it work!

930
01:26:22,994 --> 01:26:25,913
What are you doing
with my money?

931
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:32,418
Do you think it comes so easy?

932
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:33,627
No!

933
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:35,712
But, sir...

934
01:26:35,754 --> 01:26:40,424
I have been working for
nearly two weeks without sleep.

935
01:26:40,466 --> 01:26:45,052
At first blush, the theorem
appears quite convincing.

936
01:26:45,094 --> 01:26:46,637
It does?

937
01:26:51,099 --> 01:26:55,394
Yes. It does.

938
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:57,479
Good man.

939
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,189
We can use it
to destroy our enemies.

940
01:27:01,982 --> 01:27:05,485
Only Dr. Russell
can spoil my plan.

941
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:08,320
If she gets back to London
and speaks to the press...

942
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:12,198
From here to the airport
are three army checkpoints...

943
01:27:12,240 --> 01:27:14,116
all of them loyal to us.

944
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:16,243
Make certain
they get the message-

945
01:27:16,285 --> 01:27:19,162
she doesn't leave Moscow alive.

946
01:27:21,706 --> 01:27:22,957
Mr. President.

947
01:27:22,999 --> 01:27:26,126
As former Vice-minister
of Energy and Power...

948
01:27:26,168 --> 01:27:31,464
I hear all manner of schemes
that provide cheaper energy.

949
01:27:31,505 --> 01:27:35,092
And as our countrymen
freeze to death...

950
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:38,594
I've become aware of
a marvelous new technology...

951
01:27:38,636 --> 01:27:41,597
about which I'm hopelessly
out of my league...

952
01:27:41,638 --> 01:27:44,390
from a scientific viewpoint.

953
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:47,684
That's why I brought
our eminent physicist here...

954
01:27:47,726 --> 01:27:50,979
Dr. Lev Botvin from
the University of Moscow.

955
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,606
Before we are dazzled
by the good news...

956
01:27:53,647 --> 01:27:56,316
let's dispense with the bad.

957
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:58,568
What is the price
of this marvel?

958
01:27:58,609 --> 01:28:01,445
The cost of research
and development are there...

959
01:28:01,487 --> 01:28:05,198
which is all
you are asked to defray.

960
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,037
Ten billion in hard currency?

961
01:28:13,079 --> 01:28:18,208
I can't even pay my teachers,
my miners, my doctors.

962
01:28:25,713 --> 01:28:27,715
Where are you heading?

963
01:28:27,757 --> 01:28:31,176
I thought we'd drink
some vodka to get warmer.

964
01:28:35,389 --> 01:28:38,474
Like the miracle of socialism...

965
01:28:38,516 --> 01:28:41,852
our miracle
of cold fusion failed.

966
01:28:41,893 --> 01:28:43,061
But no matter.

967
01:28:43,103 --> 01:28:47,398
We have sold cold fusion
to President Karpov.

968
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:50,984
We will use the scandal
of its failure to destroy him.

969
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:53,903
The army must be mobilized
by midnight tomorrow.

970
01:28:53,944 --> 01:28:57,572
You're a man in a hurry.
That's only one day.

971
01:28:57,614 --> 01:29:01,033
Not now, old witch.
We're working.

972
01:29:01,075 --> 01:29:02,534
Yes. Think of it.

973
01:29:02,576 --> 01:29:08,414
One day, you can be proud again
to be a Russian general...

974
01:29:08,455 --> 01:29:12,584
with a big nuclear missile
where your prick used to be.

975
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:15,753
You must complete a form
before you get on a flight home.

976
01:29:15,794 --> 01:29:17,421
Any medical problems?

977
01:29:17,462 --> 01:29:18,963
I have a heart condition.

978
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:21,549
Do you need me to arrange
any medication for you?

979
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:25,010
Well, I haven't
needed a pill.

980
01:29:25,552 --> 01:29:26,761
That's strange.

981
01:29:26,803 --> 01:29:28,929
Get a form from
table three down the corridor.

982
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:30,472
I'll be back in 10 minutes...

983
01:29:30,514 --> 01:29:32,724
by your side,
all the way to the airport.

984
01:29:32,766 --> 01:29:33,933
Thank you.

985
01:29:33,975 --> 01:29:36,227
...Across the street
in central Moscow...

986
01:29:36,268 --> 01:29:40,897
where a mob attacked several
companies with ties to America.

987
01:29:40,938 --> 01:29:44,901
Apparently, four U.S. citizens
were injured in the attack.

988
01:29:44,984 --> 01:29:46,819
I'm told
that all American citizens...

989
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:49,488
have been asked to report
to the American embassy...

990
01:29:49,529 --> 01:29:51,447
for immediate evacuation.

991
01:29:51,489 --> 01:29:54,783
Excuse me. You look lost.

992
01:29:54,825 --> 01:29:57,290
- No, I'm fine.
- May I help you?

993
01:29:57,327 --> 01:30:02,081
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is August Christopher.

994
01:30:02,122 --> 01:30:05,708
Named after Saint Augustine,
who coined my favorite phrase-

995
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:08,294
"Give me chastity
and give me constancy...

996
01:30:08,335 --> 01:30:10,962
"but do not give it yet. "

997
01:30:15,091 --> 01:30:18,635
Simon, I'm on the next flight
out of here.

998
01:30:18,677 --> 01:30:19,886
Are you coming with me?

999
01:30:19,928 --> 01:30:23,430
No. But they are.

1000
01:30:29,602 --> 01:30:33,229
I'll need you to develop
a sudden fear of flying.

1001
01:30:33,271 --> 01:30:35,147
Find a quiet room.

1002
01:30:36,023 --> 01:30:38,358
Finish the formula
and fax it back to me.

1003
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,151
My number's on the back.

1004
01:30:40,193 --> 01:30:43,988
I don't understand.
Why are you keeping my cards?

1005
01:30:44,029 --> 01:30:45,864
I've got to deal
with the Russians...

1006
01:30:45,906 --> 01:30:47,991
or you'll never be safe.

1007
01:30:48,032 --> 01:30:49,784
Be good at school.

1008
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:50,993
Wait.

1009
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:56,498
- Don't you trust me, darlin'?
- Trust who?

1010
01:30:57,374 --> 01:30:59,125
That hurts, Emma.

1011
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:01,835
I'm serious.
What's your name?

1012
01:31:01,877 --> 01:31:04,671
My name is August Christopher.

1013
01:31:04,713 --> 01:31:07,715
Of course I trust you,
August Christopher.

1014
01:31:07,757 --> 01:31:09,758
I mean, Vincent Ferrer...

1015
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,010
I mean, Martin de Porres...

1016
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,096
Thomas More.

1017
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:19,224
After all,
you are my personal saint.

1018
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:22,101
You have to be a very good...

1019
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,687
and, usually, a very dead person
to become a saint.

1020
01:31:25,729 --> 01:31:29,356
And more importantly,
you have to work three miracles.

1021
01:31:29,398 --> 01:31:31,692
Now, get to work.

1022
01:31:32,484 --> 01:31:34,152
Who's that man?

1023
01:31:34,193 --> 01:31:36,570
You're leaving
on the transport at 9:00, ma'am?

1024
01:31:36,612 --> 01:31:39,614
Probably be your
last chance out of here.

1025
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:41,157
Better hurry. It's leaving.

1026
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:46,161
Your troops
will depose the president...

1027
01:31:46,203 --> 01:31:49,163
and install Ivan Tretiak
as leader of Russia.

1028
01:31:49,205 --> 01:31:53,959
Moscow must be
ringed with tanks by evening.

1029
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,336
Don't worry.
The people will follow me.

1030
01:31:57,378 --> 01:31:59,630
They will be crying
for revolution.

1031
01:31:59,671 --> 01:32:02,257
Still, no one's
guessed the simple truth...

1032
01:32:02,298 --> 01:32:04,383
of where the heating oil went.

1033
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:11,390
Who would believe
that a sea of oil...

1034
01:32:11,431 --> 01:32:14,100
was hidden under
this very building?

1035
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:18,770
Yuri, I understand
your Nataly is to...

1036
01:32:18,812 --> 01:32:21,397
Francis, you devil...

1037
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:23,774
I heard you came here,
and you didn't call me.

1038
01:32:23,816 --> 01:32:27,193
- Hello, Dominic-
- Give me a ring, Charles.

1039
01:32:27,235 --> 01:32:29,945
Lou,
I've heard on the grapevine...

1040
01:32:29,987 --> 01:32:33,323
you're brokering a revolutionary
new energy source.

1041
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:36,492
If it's as good
as it's cracked up to be...

1042
01:32:36,534 --> 01:32:39,786
I have friends who can double
your best offer...

1043
01:32:39,828 --> 01:32:41,996
on deposit in Zurich...

1044
01:32:42,038 --> 01:32:44,915
within one hour
of delivery and confirmation.

1045
01:32:45,749 --> 01:32:46,917
I'll be waiting.

1046
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,017
The work could be here.

1047
01:33:10,059 --> 01:33:11,977
This machine could work,
couldn't it?

1048
01:33:14,771 --> 01:33:16,439
Who are you?

1049
01:33:16,481 --> 01:33:18,607
A friend of Dr. Russell's.

1050
01:33:18,649 --> 01:33:19,859
Dr. Russell?

1051
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:24,113
What's this equation?

1052
01:33:24,154 --> 01:33:25,530
It's so simple.

1053
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:29,158
This is the key
to Dr. Russell's formula.

1054
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,534
Yes.

1055
01:33:32,369 --> 01:33:34,621
The alarm. You had better go.

1056
01:33:34,662 --> 01:33:38,707
I need a miracle.
You've got 12 hours.

1057
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:42,418
But Mr. Tretiak's rally
is tonight.

1058
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:44,128
Can you make it work?

1059
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:46,963
Make it work.

1060
01:33:51,508 --> 01:33:52,968
What is wrong here?

1061
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,427
Uh, the alarm...

1062
01:33:57,138 --> 01:33:59,056
Uh... uh...

1063
01:33:59,806 --> 01:34:01,266
I tripped.

1064
01:34:10,106 --> 01:34:13,650
You are Nikolai Petrovich.

1065
01:34:13,692 --> 01:34:15,402
You are Nikolai Provovich-

1066
01:34:15,443 --> 01:34:16,653
Petrovich.

1067
01:34:27,744 --> 01:34:29,788
Tunnel built by KGB...

1068
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,417
Leads to machine room
in Kremlin.

1069
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:38,670
Do you know where
the president's quarters are?

1070
01:34:38,712 --> 01:34:42,673
President Karpov is there.

1071
01:34:42,715 --> 01:34:46,885
But there are many guards,
so I suggest-

1072
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:48,928
An alternate route?

1073
01:34:48,970 --> 01:34:51,889
Money. Now.

1074
01:34:53,849 --> 01:34:55,433
Oh, ye of little faith.

1075
01:34:58,144 --> 01:35:00,854
Russia stands tonight...

1076
01:35:00,896 --> 01:35:03,731
on the brink
of a second revolution.

1077
01:35:03,773 --> 01:35:06,316
As the number of deaths
from freezing mounts...

1078
01:35:06,358 --> 01:35:08,318
hundreds of thousands
of protesters...

1079
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,528
have taken to the streets.

1080
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,196
Even as
Russian President Karpov...

1081
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:14,489
is promising
a mysterious solution...

1082
01:35:14,531 --> 01:35:16,449
to the crippling
heating-oil shortage...

1083
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:18,701
troops opposed
to the elected government...

1084
01:35:18,743 --> 01:35:21,041
and led
by General Leo Sklarov...

1085
01:35:21,078 --> 01:35:23,872
have begun to ring
the Russian capital city.

1086
01:35:23,913 --> 01:35:25,873
Angry, frightened citizens...

1087
01:35:25,915 --> 01:35:28,709
are gathering outside
the Kremlin in Red Square...

1088
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,585
but they're not braving
the bitter cold...

1089
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:32,712
for yet another political rally.

1090
01:35:32,753 --> 01:35:36,214
They've been drawn here by
the promise of a revelation...

1091
01:35:36,256 --> 01:35:37,674
whatever that may be...

1092
01:35:37,715 --> 01:35:40,217
in what's become
a life-and-death struggle...

1093
01:35:40,259 --> 01:35:43,262
for the future
of democracy in Russia.

1094
01:36:58,654 --> 01:37:01,490
Mr. President?
I'm your friend.

1095
01:37:01,526 --> 01:37:03,324
What do you want?

1096
01:37:05,201 --> 01:37:08,495
I want to help you
to destroy Tretiak.

1097
01:37:08,537 --> 01:37:10,330
I need you to listen
for about 30 seconds.

1098
01:37:12,164 --> 01:37:14,958
I'm all right. Stay outside.

1099
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,001
Please, continue.

1100
01:37:17,043 --> 01:37:20,462
Tonight you'll stand trial
in Red Square before the world.

1101
01:37:20,499 --> 01:37:23,882
Whatever Tretiak accuses you of,
I need you to admit to it.

1102
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:25,466
Agree with this criminal?

1103
01:37:25,508 --> 01:37:28,385
If you want
to destroy Tretiak... yes.

1104
01:37:45,565 --> 01:37:47,775
Gruschev,
take Mr. Karpov downstairs.

1105
01:37:47,817 --> 01:37:49,026
The wife stays here.

1106
01:37:51,236 --> 01:37:54,655
Get your hands off!
What you are doing is illegal!

1107
01:37:54,697 --> 01:37:56,657
The people won't stand for it!

1108
01:37:56,698 --> 01:38:00,159
The people are too cold
to stop it. Who are you?

1109
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:17,215
Tretiak!
Tretiak! Tretiak!

1110
01:38:32,602 --> 01:38:34,728
Friends...

1111
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:36,688
countrymen...

1112
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:38,898
Russians!

1113
01:38:48,572 --> 01:38:52,909
You heard about this morning's
sensational events.

1114
01:38:52,951 --> 01:38:56,078
Many shocking documents
were recovered...

1115
01:38:56,120 --> 01:38:58,371
from the president's
secret files...

1116
01:38:58,413 --> 01:39:01,045
locked within his private safe.

1117
01:39:01,082 --> 01:39:06,044
The documents which will be
published in today's papers...

1118
01:39:06,086 --> 01:39:10,386
prove that the traitor Karpov...

1119
01:39:10,422 --> 01:39:14,300
was about to steal
over 40 trillion...

1120
01:39:14,342 --> 01:39:17,219
of our precious
Russian rubles...

1121
01:39:17,261 --> 01:39:21,932
in a reckless scheme
to save his hide!

1122
01:39:21,969 --> 01:39:23,934
To add insult...

1123
01:39:23,975 --> 01:39:26,936
millions of dollars
were to be paid...

1124
01:39:26,972 --> 01:39:30,063
to this international criminal!

1125
01:39:37,027 --> 01:39:39,070
And for what
was your president...

1126
01:39:39,112 --> 01:39:43,245
hoping to bankrupt
our national treasury?

1127
01:39:43,282 --> 01:39:48,431
What you see is a fairy tale
called cold fusion.

1128
01:39:48,468 --> 01:39:53,581
You pass electric current
into the machine...

1129
01:39:53,623 --> 01:39:57,876
and there is supposed
to be a chemical reaction.

1130
01:39:57,918 --> 01:39:59,502
Watch.

1131
01:39:59,544 --> 01:40:03,172
It can't even light up
a tiny light bulb!

1132
01:40:03,213 --> 01:40:05,674
Do you dare deny this,
Mr. Karpov?

1133
01:40:05,715 --> 01:40:07,925
Absolutely not!

1134
01:40:07,967 --> 01:40:10,266
I proudly admit it!

1135
01:40:10,302 --> 01:40:13,430
But enough puny failure.

1136
01:40:13,471 --> 01:40:15,598
Failure's in the past!

1137
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:18,892
Begging is behind us!

1138
01:40:18,934 --> 01:40:22,687
The balance of power
is about to shift!

1139
01:40:56,630 --> 01:40:58,673
Miracle one.

1140
01:41:03,052 --> 01:41:23,734
Karpov! Karpov!

1141
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:32,157
Ilya! Ilya!

1142
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:33,575
Go! Go!

1143
01:41:33,617 --> 01:41:35,160
Go, go, go!

1144
01:41:36,702 --> 01:41:41,165
I order all troops
loyal to mother Russia...

1145
01:41:41,207 --> 01:41:44,668
to seize the criminal Tretiak!

1146
01:41:50,214 --> 01:41:51,840
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President.

1147
01:41:51,882 --> 01:41:55,259
There was a miscommunication
in the chain of command.

1148
01:42:01,722 --> 01:42:03,140
Miracle two.

1149
01:42:03,224 --> 01:42:06,434
The billionaire
industrialist and his son...

1150
01:42:06,476 --> 01:42:09,020
were taken to the infamous
Lubyanka prison...

1151
01:42:09,061 --> 01:42:13,127
where they await trial
along with General Leo Sklarov.

1152
01:42:13,163 --> 01:42:17,193
Moscow woke today to the
forgotten sensation of warmth...

1153
01:42:17,234 --> 01:42:19,486
as millions of gallons
of heating oil...

1154
01:42:19,528 --> 01:42:22,718
flowed from a storage depot
beneath Tretiak's mansion.

1155
01:42:22,754 --> 01:42:25,908
He made no threat
to contact you in the future?

1156
01:42:25,949 --> 01:42:27,784
He never had the chance.

1157
01:42:27,826 --> 01:42:29,118
You'll tell us
if he makes contact?

1158
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,328
Yes.

1159
01:42:30,369 --> 01:42:35,123
Which he may well do.
He's a proper rogue.

1160
01:42:35,165 --> 01:42:38,751
He charms women,
this so-called Saint.

1161
01:42:38,792 --> 01:42:41,711
It seems it's his stock
in trade. No offense.

1162
01:42:41,753 --> 01:42:45,589
Well, I am offended.
All I got from this Saint...

1163
01:42:45,631 --> 01:42:47,799
was a series
of near-death experiences.

1164
01:42:47,841 --> 01:42:49,097
Count yourself lucky.

1165
01:42:49,134 --> 01:42:53,596
I have a very important
conference I must prepare for.

1166
01:42:53,638 --> 01:42:55,973
We understand.
You have a life.

1167
01:42:56,015 --> 01:42:57,725
We appreciate
your taking the time.

1168
01:42:57,766 --> 01:42:59,267
No problem.

1169
01:43:05,772 --> 01:43:07,774
She's in love with him.

1170
01:44:18,204 --> 01:44:21,039
I wanted to call you
and tell you everything.

1171
01:44:21,081 --> 01:44:22,290
It hasn't been safe.

1172
01:44:22,332 --> 01:44:24,959
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

1173
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:32,256
So... have you been busy?

1174
01:44:32,298 --> 01:44:34,841
Yeah.
I've been working real hard.

1175
01:44:34,878 --> 01:44:37,348
Thank God I have my cards back.

1176
01:44:37,385 --> 01:44:41,013
You don't believe in
this cold fusion mumbo jumbo?

1177
01:44:41,054 --> 01:44:43,723
You know,
you're a very pretty lady.

1178
01:44:43,765 --> 01:44:46,058
Oh, my God.

1179
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,559
That was you?

1180
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,020
That's who I thought
Dr. Russell would like.

1181
01:44:52,104 --> 01:44:54,690
I thought you were
some old biddy...

1182
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:58,109
not some gorgeous
soon-to-be-trillionaire.

1183
01:44:58,151 --> 01:45:01,070
You know you're going to be
the richest woman in the world.

1184
01:45:01,111 --> 01:45:02,237
I am?

1185
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:05,198
Why do you think
I'm hanging around?

1186
01:45:11,661 --> 01:45:12,787
- Emma.
- Yeah?

1187
01:45:12,828 --> 01:45:14,580
My life is very strange.

1188
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:16,874
I just...

1189
01:45:20,836 --> 01:45:23,004
I don't do anything normal.

1190
01:45:23,046 --> 01:45:24,588
I'm-I can't even-

1191
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:28,091
I know. I know you.

1192
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:31,719
I know your life.

1193
01:45:31,761 --> 01:45:34,388
- What do you want?
- I want you.

1194
01:45:34,429 --> 01:45:36,473
For how long?

1195
01:45:36,514 --> 01:45:38,516
It doesn't matter.

1196
01:45:45,438 --> 01:45:47,147
Tell me you love me.

1197
01:45:49,065 --> 01:45:50,733
I- I love you.

1198
01:45:51,818 --> 01:45:52,985
Simon.

1199
01:45:54,445 --> 01:45:56,655
I love you, Simon.

1200
01:45:57,906 --> 01:45:59,949
Miracle three.

1201
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:25,468
Dear Simon...

1202
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:28,888
the pin is something
I've kept for years.

1203
01:46:28,930 --> 01:46:32,349
A graduation gift
from Catholic school.

1204
01:46:32,391 --> 01:46:34,935
But don't worry.
You don't have to wear it.

1205
01:46:34,976 --> 01:46:37,437
I just wanted you
to have something of mine...

1206
01:46:37,478 --> 01:46:39,605
something I loved.

1207
01:46:39,647 --> 01:46:42,524
Simon, if sainthood
requires three miracles...

1208
01:46:42,566 --> 01:46:45,318
then I'd say you've made it,
my love...

1209
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:47,528
and so I hope you'll understand.

1210
01:46:47,569 --> 01:46:51,155
Last night, it became clear
what I have to do this morning.

1211
01:46:51,197 --> 01:46:54,533
I'm going to give
cold fusion to the world.

1212
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:57,452
It's the only way,
if we're ever together again...

1213
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:01,330
that I'll know it's for you,
and you'll know it's for me.

1214
01:47:01,366 --> 01:47:06,500
If cold fusion is free,
then you and I will be free.

1215
01:47:06,542 --> 01:47:09,795
If you think giving away
everything before the world...

1216
01:47:09,836 --> 01:47:12,171
preventing us from making
an unimaginable fortune...

1217
01:47:12,213 --> 01:47:16,008
will accomplish anything...
you're absolutely right.

1218
01:47:18,843 --> 01:47:20,803
Simon, what are you doing here?

1219
01:47:20,845 --> 01:47:23,305
There are police.

1220
01:47:23,347 --> 01:47:24,806
They're everywhere.

1221
01:47:24,848 --> 01:47:27,183
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1222
01:47:27,225 --> 01:47:30,269
- You wore the pin.
- Of course.

1223
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:35,397
You better go.

1224
01:47:49,326 --> 01:47:50,660
How will I find you?

1225
01:47:52,703 --> 01:47:55,539
I'll find you. You found me.

1226
01:48:22,685 --> 01:48:25,770
Although our next speaker
requires no introduction...

1227
01:48:25,812 --> 01:48:30,357
after last week's
Moscow fireworks...

1228
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:34,819
please let me welcome
Dr. E.J. Russell.

1229
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:38,738
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

1230
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:41,782
No.

1231
01:48:41,824 --> 01:48:43,617
Dr. Russell?

1232
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:55,586
You don't believe in all this
cold fusion mumbo jumbo, do you?

1233
01:48:55,622 --> 01:48:57,254
Thank you. Good morning.

1234
01:48:57,295 --> 01:48:58,796
No.

1235
01:48:58,838 --> 01:49:03,050
We all know cold fusion
has had a...

1236
01:49:03,091 --> 01:49:06,052
a difficult childhood.

1237
01:49:06,094 --> 01:49:08,721
Those of us in the field
are orphans...

1238
01:49:08,762 --> 01:49:10,722
bastards, at best.

1239
01:49:10,764 --> 01:49:15,893
But difficult childhoods make
the most interesting adults.

1240
01:49:17,394 --> 01:49:19,729
I know most of you thought
that cold fusion...

1241
01:49:19,771 --> 01:49:22,439
I'm her biggest fan.

1242
01:49:22,481 --> 01:49:25,280
I think she's a fox.
Look at that.

1243
01:49:25,317 --> 01:49:28,361
Even though
some of you may feel...

1244
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:32,155
that its practical application
is still somewhat speculative...

1245
01:49:32,197 --> 01:49:36,450
I've come here today to share
how that dream is slowly...

1246
01:49:36,492 --> 01:49:37,618
becoming a reality.

1247
01:49:37,659 --> 01:49:41,162
Yes, it may take years
to finally learn...

1248
01:49:41,204 --> 01:49:43,164
Look at the time.
Got to go.

1249
01:49:43,205 --> 01:49:46,833
...stabilize its power,
but with your help...

1250
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:49,877
we can all work towards
making the-the...

1251
01:49:51,045 --> 01:49:55,506
dream of cold fusion
finally come true.

1252
01:50:19,692 --> 01:50:20,818
Quickly!

1253
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:22,695
We got him!

1254
01:50:22,731 --> 01:50:24,655
Hyah!

1255
01:50:26,364 --> 01:50:28,157
Hands behind your back!

1256
01:50:28,199 --> 01:50:30,284
Got you, you slippery-

1257
01:50:30,325 --> 01:50:31,576
What's going on?

1258
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:39,082
Damn!

1259
01:50:46,046 --> 01:50:47,964
