<i>You're gonna go right up
to the gate and get her?</i>

3
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:43,071
<i>Yeah. Jane, listen, I'm gonna
be as close as security allows.</i>

4
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:47,174
<i>You know, she's pretty grown now.
Or at least she thinks she is.</i>

5
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:50,710
<i>Jane, listen, I'm gonna be there
and I'm not gonna miss her.</i>

6
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,533
<i>I'm gonna take her to get her bag,</i>

7
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:55,203
<i>back to my place and I'm gonna
feed her and entertain her.</i>

8
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:57,449
<i>And we're gonna do
the same thing all summer, okay?</i>

9
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:01,875
<i>Okay. Thanks, really.</i>

10
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,492
<i>Got a good tailwind up south.</i>

11
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,727
<i>We should be able to make up
for that lost time</i>

12
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:15,497
<i>on our slightly late departure
out of Seattle.</i>

13
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:19,267
<i>Hope to have us all down
in Juneau on schedule,</i>

14
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:23,336
<i>about 11:35.
Meantime, we have clear skies.</i>

15
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:25,960
<i>The good news...</i>

16
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,792
Kenz!

17
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,561
Kenzie! Kenz!

18
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,531
Hey!

19
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:01,891
How are you?

20
00:06:07,205 --> 00:06:11,610
- Is this your bags here?
- Yeah, I got it, thanks.

21
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,746
Yeah, so how was your flight?

22
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,081
- It was fine.
- Fine?

23
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:21,218
I'm sorry you had to move around so much.

24
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,243
Glad you're here with me though.

25
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,615
Just hop in there.

26
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,885
Welcome to Alaska.

27
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,000
Here we are.

28
00:07:09,258 --> 00:07:12,917
Jesus. What'd you pack in here?

29
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,905
So this is... your home now.

30
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,741
Go ahead and just help yourself
to whatever you want, okay?

31
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:33,668
There's the kitchen over there
and "mi casa es su casa."

32
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:41,274
It's like your own wing down here.

33
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,144
This is your room.

34
00:07:49,656 --> 00:07:53,760
Over here is a closet for you. Put some
extra blankets in there and hangers.

35
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,985
It gets cold at night, okay?

36
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:06,160
Okay. Well... just take your time
and make yourself at home, all right?

37
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,090
I can't believe how much you've grown up.

38
00:08:34,697 --> 00:08:37,134
Just look at you.

39
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:41,426
The last time I saw you...

40
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,080
Your dad really liked this place.

41
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,139
I'm not sure why.

42
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:06,381
I miss him.

43
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,785
I miss him too.

44
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:17,066
But maybe you want dessert?

45
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:20,458
Yeah? Well, let's see what they have.

46
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:25,305
- Well, how long am I up here for?
- <i>I don't know. I need some time.</i>

47
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:28,807
<i>I just wanna be strong. You know,
there's just the two of us, okay?</i>

48
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:31,276
- Yeah, whatever.
- <i>Don't do that.</i>

49
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:34,678
<i>I'm gonna get set up in an apartment
nearby so I can just be an outpatient.</i>

50
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:38,180
- Really? Where?
- <i>Seattle. Like around our old neighborhood.</i>

51
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,282
I wanna come back then.

52
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:43,318
<i>Oh, well, it's not that easy.
It doesn't really work that way.</i>

53
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:47,888
<i>This is still part of my treatment, so...
How are you guys getting along?</i>

54
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,624
- Fine.
- <i>He said you were havin' a blast.</i>

55
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,093
<i>Said you're like an adult
compared to when he came</i>

56
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:56,596
<i>and he stayed with you for, like,
three nights. Remember that?</i>

57
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:00,020
<i>After Dad's funeral.</i>

58
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:47,566
I have to go to work tomorrow.
I was thinking you should come with me.

59
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:53,379
- I think I'm just gonna stay here.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

60
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:56,103
We have computers and stuff.

61
00:10:58,515 --> 00:10:59,740
Okay.

62
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:09,793
Right.

63
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:14,392
Okay, I'll take a look at it and I'll
call you back. All right, thanks.

64
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,433
I don't even know how long I'm here, Mom
says like a month, but who the hell knows?

65
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:59,203
Hey, Kenz, this is my buddy Blain.
This is my niece, Mackenzie.

66
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:01,004
Hi.

67
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,876
Hey.

68
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,664
She's on the phone.

69
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:09,633
It's all right, it's my uncle.

70
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,988
Kenzie, want more pizza?

71
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,557
No, I'm gonna throw up.

72
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:27,159
- Don't do that.
- Come on, hang out.

73
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:30,851
- Have a seat.
- Watch some TV.

74
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,933
Oh, man, I forgot something.

75
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,291
I'll be right back.

76
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,478
- Is that your phone?
- No.

77
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:56,382
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

78
00:12:57,382 --> 00:13:00,284
- Answer it. Pick it up, answer it.
- What?

79
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:02,552
- Pick it up, answer it.
- No, no, you answer it.

80
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,811
- Answer it, pick it up.
- No. Fine. Fine.

81
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:10,258
Stupid. Hello?

82
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,463
Surprise!

83
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,629
- What?
- It's... it's for you.

84
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,073
It's from me.

85
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,303
- You like it?
- For real?

86
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:24,469
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

87
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,471
This is mine? Shit!

88
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,774
Blain went and picked it up for me.

89
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:34,477
- You really like it?
- Yes! Fuck, thank you.

90
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,868
- Hey.
- Hey.

91
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:54,718
Come on!

92
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:11,117
You havin' fun?

93
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,501
Yeah.

94
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,150
So...

95
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,085
You like livin' here?

96
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,020
Yeah.

97
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,455
What's not to like?

98
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,590
I don't know.

99
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,764
It's cold.

100
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,818
Well, yeah, in the winter it's cold.

101
00:14:41,565 --> 00:14:44,102
How long you been here?

102
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:46,771
Well, about 15 years.

103
00:14:46,871 --> 00:14:49,565
Have you lived here
by yourself the whole time?

104
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,120
What about a... a girlfriend?

105
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,678
Well, we broke up.

106
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:11,126
What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

107
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,192
No.

108
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,686
Well, I imagine all the guys
would be chasing you.

109
00:15:17,898 --> 00:15:19,722
Yeah.

110
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,210
What about, like, a dog or something?
You ever get a dog?

111
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,879
- No. You ever have a dog?
- No, but I want one.

112
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:39,381
- You do?
- Yeah.

113
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,116
Well, why don't we get a dog?

114
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:45,465
- For real?
- Yeah. We got the space.

115
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:48,376
Yeah, let's do it.

116
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,884
Wanna try these on and see how they feel?

117
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:16,544
It's always cooler out here
by the glacier, you know?

118
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:19,847
Like, ten degrees cooler
in the wintertime.

119
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:23,383
Check that out, Kenz. Mendenhall Glacier.

120
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:26,319
Won't see anything like this
anywhere else, Kenz.

121
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,243
It's pretty awesome?

122
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:11,516
Got you some water.

123
00:21:15,162 --> 00:21:18,765
I'm gonna go back to my truck
and get my camera.

124
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:21,434
It's turning out to be
a pretty nice day, man.

125
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:26,539
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna take Kenzie
over to the waterfall, okay?

126
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,099
I'm feeling fish tacos, by the way.
Fish tacos?

127
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:40,039
- Are you cold?
- I'm fine.

128
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:47,000
How's that sound, fish tacos?

129
00:22:14,914 --> 00:22:17,140
She's gentle.

130
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,681
Come on, Skadi.

131
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:47,996
I think I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

132
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:53,340
You need your bag?

133
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,951
Mackenzie!

134
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:31,096
<i>Hey, West Seattle Health Center.</i>

135
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:35,666
Hey, is Jane there?
It's Mackenzie, I'm calling for my mom.

136
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:38,136
- <i>I'm sorry, who's this?</i>
- Hey, is Jane there?

137
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,708
<i>Jane. We haven't seen her all week.
She checked herself out.</i>

138
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:43,272
- Who is this?
- <i>This is Bill, head RN.</i>

139
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:47,400
<i>Look, if you see her then please tell her
we're really concerned, all right? I think...</i>

140
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:36,631
Oh, God.

141
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:41,434
Carolyn, I was an idiot thinking
I could do this all alone.

142
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:45,605
I wish you were here. I just miss you.

143
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,430
I miss you.

144
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:38,143
Oh, God!

145
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,781
Hey!

146
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,549
Sit down.

147
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,673
Sit down.

148
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,678
- We're gonna have a little talk.
- Come on, I didn't...

149
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:23,183
- You got something to return?
- Come on, it's not like...

150
00:33:23,283 --> 00:33:25,034
- I didn't take anything!
- Come on?

151
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:28,404
Look, I just... I got the rooms confused.

152
00:33:28,504 --> 00:33:31,273
- It happens, okay?
- Yeah, I'm not buying it.

153
00:33:31,373 --> 00:33:35,343
I'm sorry, you scared me.
You scared me shitless.

154
00:33:35,443 --> 00:33:38,159
Look, I just... it was a misunderstanding.

155
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:46,887
Okay.

156
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:49,878
Okay. Forget it.

157
00:33:51,122 --> 00:33:52,980
Okay.

158
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,277
But, you know,
it was pretty freaky last night.

159
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:17,314
- I wish I had a camera, you jumped so high.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

160
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:21,784
- Just about to call the manager...
- You don't... you don't have to do that.

161
00:34:21,884 --> 00:34:25,000
It's fine. I'm just... just kidding.

162
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,556
So, are you from around here or...

163
00:34:28,656 --> 00:34:32,144
- No.
- Just a vacation?

164
00:34:34,494 --> 00:34:36,662
- Yeah.
- Out by yourself?

165
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:40,154
Not with like a group
or a wife or something?

166
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:45,859
I see you're getting the ferry.

167
00:34:48,138 --> 00:34:51,206
- 11:00 a.m. to Seattle?
- 11:00 a.m. goes to Whittier.

168
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,841
Yeah, no, yeah, Whittier.

169
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:56,610
But it goes to Seattle after that, right?

170
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,846
- Yeah, it goes to Seattle eventually.
- How we doin' over here?

171
00:34:59,946 --> 00:35:02,115
Anything else I can get you? More coffee?

172
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:04,517
- Gonna have the check, please.
- Okay.

173
00:35:04,617 --> 00:35:06,519
Is that where you're from?

174
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,887
That's where I live, yeah.

175
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:17,321
Have you got a ferry schedule I can look at?

176
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:20,957
Yeah, it's in my room,
maybe you can break in.

177
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,340
- Here you go, have a great day.
- Thank you.

178
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,620
The ferry leaves today...

179
00:35:28,537 --> 00:35:31,906
- and then again in two weeks.
- Two weeks?

180
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,431
Yeah, two weeks.

181
00:35:50,755 --> 00:35:53,391
- Hi, folks, welcome aboard.
- <i>Bound for Whittier.</i>

182
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:59,586
<i>Car ramp closes in 15 minutes

183
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:31,058
<i>Kenz, it's me. Where are you?</i>

184
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:35,595
<i>Look, if you did this on purpose,
that's okay. Just... just call me.</i>

185
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,632
<i>Look, I saw the money missing
from the kitchen, okay?</i>

186
00:36:39,732 --> 00:36:41,316
<i>I'm sure you needed it, but...</i>

187
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:44,435
<i>I'm not gonna go to the police,
I wouldn't do that to you.</i>

188
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,538
<i>I don't wanna get you

189
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:52,364

Just call me or text me or anything.</i>

190
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:16,630
<i>Welcome aboard the bus to Anchorage,
Denali, and Fairbanks.</i>

191
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,899
<i>We'll be in Anchorage in about an hour,
Denali about five hours,</i>

192
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:22,624
<i>and into Fairbanks in about eight.</i>

193
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:18,560
<i>Hey, here we are at Denali National Park
for all you backpackers, hikers,</i>

194
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,556
<i>and daring souls. Next stop is Fairbanks.</i>

195
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:26,648
<i>We have about a five minute break here
for you to stretch your legs.</i>

196
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,090
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

197
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,214
Let's go.

198
00:40:04,015 --> 00:40:05,885
Hey.

199
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:08,586
What's up?

200
00:40:08,686 --> 00:40:11,855
Yeah, hey.

201
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:15,291
- Nothing.
- Listen, I need a favor.

202
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:17,559
Can I use your shower?

203
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:21,929
I'm waiting for my room.
Like, it's just... it's just not ready.

204
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:24,464
Bummer.

205
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:26,826
My name's Jennifer.

206
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,457
Hey, Jennifer.

207
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:32,726
Tommy.

208
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,098
Sorry.

209
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:44,305
Shower's in the bathroom.

210
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,551
Yeah.

211
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:49,742
Makes sense.

212
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:23,048
I washed my clothes,
so they're hanging in your bathroom.

213
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:26,881
- Sorry.
- Hey, no worries.

214
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:28,986
My turn.

215
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,110
You can hang out.

216
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:34,657
Don't steal my stuff?

217
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:36,981
It's a deal.

218
00:42:01,013 --> 00:42:03,423
Guess you were tired.

219
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:06,442
I'll just go check if my clothes are dry.

220
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,183
So I'm... I'm headed out
early tomorrow morning.

221
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:24,467
What are your plans? Where are you headed?

222
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:28,103
I'm going to Seattle.

223
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:30,171
You from there?

224
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,541
Yeah. How about you?

225
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:38,378
Backpacking to Denali.
I mean, I'm from Michigan.

226
00:42:38,478 --> 00:42:40,280
Yeah.

227
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,971
Goin' through the park.

228
00:42:44,315 --> 00:42:46,218
That's cool.

229
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:48,420
Can I see?

230
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,344
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

231
00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:55,058
So...

232
00:42:56,358 --> 00:43:01,029
Okay, so we're gonna get
dropped off here at Kantishna,

233
00:43:01,129 --> 00:43:04,615
and then make our way down
to Mount McKinley,

234
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,683
try and get a good view.
Anchorage is down here,

235
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:13,143
and over here off the map is Seattle.

236
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:19,107
So when do you fly out?

237
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:21,344
I don't know.

238
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:23,946
I might take a ferry out.

239
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:27,082
Really? Ferry takes a while, no?

240
00:43:27,278 --> 00:43:29,451
Yeah, but...

241
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:34,512
Hey, do you want me to just, like,
hold this room for you until you get back?

242
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,758
- You're funny.
- Come on, why not?

243
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:42,264
- It's expensive.
- Oh, well. I'm worth it.

244
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:46,286
Well, just don't go on your trip. Stay here.

245
00:43:46,697 --> 00:43:49,031
But I want to go.
I've been planning this trip for...

246
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:51,155
Just kidding.

247
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:58,094
Hey, are you, like, in some kind
of trouble or something?

248
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:35,828
You...

249
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:40,631
- Hey. I'm sorry, I...
- Yo, Tommy, open up.

250
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,579
- Whoa.
- Hey, Jennifer. Hey.

251
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:48,181
Tommy, who is this?

252
00:44:48,281 --> 00:44:49,615
- All right.
- Jennifer.

253
00:44:49,715 --> 00:44:52,006
Tommy, who's that?

254
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:16,974
<i>Kenzie.</i>

255
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:20,532
<i>I wish I knew where you were.</i>

256
00:45:21,577 --> 00:45:25,202
<i>Listen, I... I don't know what else to do.</i>

257
00:45:26,947 --> 00:45:29,171
<i>I miss you.</i>

258
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:33,175
<i>Fuck.</i>

259
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:20,672
Fire is almost out.

260
00:46:21,098 --> 00:46:23,800
- It's gas.
- Drink, miss?

261
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,869
- Yeah, an orange juice.
- No, she's fine.

262
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:29,604
Just... yeah, sure. Bring her juice.

263
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:32,028
Orange juice, got it.

264
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:35,464
Thank you.

265
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,662
So, what's your name?

266
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:47,165
Jennifer.

267
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,235
My name's Rene Bartlett.

268
00:46:52,055 --> 00:46:54,656
- Rene?
- Yes, it's French.

269
00:46:54,756 --> 00:46:57,606
Bart would be easier.

270
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:02,610
<i>Oui.</i>

271
00:47:04,664 --> 00:47:08,535
So, Bart, what is your itinerary?

272
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:11,584
My plans?

273
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,288
I'm gonna hike through
the park for a few days.

274
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:20,310
I'm...

275
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,774
- I'm hiking around, too.
- Are you here by yourself?

276
00:47:27,015 --> 00:47:28,764
Yeah.

277
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:36,456
Have you been here before?

278
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:39,725
How long are you staying at this lodge?

279
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:42,294
Tomorrow I start hiking, thank goodness.

280
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:46,411
Get on the Denali bus,
and then I get off and hike.

281
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:50,167
Hike and hike.

282
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,337
Tents and backpacks and shit.

283
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:58,807
- You know, I'm sorry, I'm not...
- You're taking the same bus as today?

284
00:47:58,907 --> 00:48:01,142
No, that's the bus that goes
to the visitors' center.

285
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:03,845
I'm taking the bus that goes to Denali.

286
00:48:04,245 --> 00:48:06,127
What is Denali?

287
00:48:08,047 --> 00:48:10,616
It's the park...

288
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:13,485
that's named for the mountain.

289
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:30,765
<i>Good morning and welcome
to Denali National Park and Preserve.</i>

290
00:48:30,865 --> 00:48:36,103
<i>We're scheduled to drive into the Toklat
River, Mile 53, before we turn around.</i>

291
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:41,173
<i>We'll be making stops along the way
for backpackers and day hikers.</i>

292
00:48:41,273 --> 00:48:43,275
<i>You're always welcome
to put the windows down.</i>

293
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:46,178
<i>Sometimes you can even get a photograph.</i>

294
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:49,014
<i>Use your binoculars, your cameras.</i>

295
00:48:49,114 --> 00:48:54,786
<i>If you guys have any questions at all
throughout the day, don't hesitate to ask.</i>

296
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:05,419
Okay, folks, we're gonna load up.

297
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,036
Next stop is Eielson,
about an hour from here.

298
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,226
Bart?

299
00:50:36,879 --> 00:50:39,415
The bus just left. Hey!

300
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:42,251
Hey! Hey!

301
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:44,200
Hey!

302
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,946
You're just gonna have
to walk the road back to...

303
00:51:15,646 --> 00:51:20,917
just to the park entrance. I mean,
you'll... you'll get a ride. There'll be...

304
00:51:21,217 --> 00:51:24,153
There'll be a bus here or somethin'.

305
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:28,051
You should just stay on the road and...

306
00:51:32,892 --> 00:51:36,051
Not a problem. You'll be okay.

307
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,300
You know...

308
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,935
make a lot of noise
just for the bears, you know,

309
00:51:43,035 --> 00:51:46,304
and, well... I mean, you won't see
any bears. You'll be fine.

310
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,706
You'll just...

311
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,854
you'll be fine.

312
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:56,659
Just... stick to the road.

313
00:52:22,536 --> 00:52:25,352
I'm not going back on the road.

314
00:52:27,072 --> 00:52:31,009
- You don't have a choice.
- I'm hiking, too.

315
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,824
Seriously, there's the road.

316
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:38,881
What... what are you doing?

317
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:42,817
Listen, you know what? It's rude.

318
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:45,686
It's rude to intentionally
follow other hikers.

319
00:52:45,786 --> 00:52:48,055
There's a code...

320
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:50,904
of privacy.

321
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:00,679
Okay...

322
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:06,102
I'll wait with you. We'll, just...

323
00:53:06,202 --> 00:53:08,371
I'll wait with you.

324
00:53:08,771 --> 00:53:12,674
We'll just go back up to the road,
and if it takes an hour, it takes an hour,

325
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,710
it takes two hours,

326
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,262
fine, okay?

327
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:19,546
Come on.

328
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,730
Get off of me. Get the fuck off me.

329
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,880
I'm gonna wait by the road.

330
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:53,881
You also just happen to be
stopping here for the night.

331
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,983
Is that it?

332
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:58,143
Yeah.

333
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,380
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- To eat dinner.

334
00:58:03,644 --> 00:58:06,046
We eat a hundred yards from the tent.
We don't make fires.

335
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:09,337
I cook on a stove
and there are no marshmallows.

336
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:14,152
Don't spill food on yourself,
don't break any branches,

337
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:19,570
don't step on any flowers, and just leave
everything the way you found it.

338
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,595
This is bear spray.

339
00:58:25,695 --> 00:58:31,327
Hold onto it. Never approach
a bear or a moose or whatever.

340
00:58:31,427 --> 00:58:34,636
Don't approach them.
If a bear charges you, then...

341
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:38,019
- I know what I'm doing.
- You have no idea.

342
00:58:39,906 --> 00:58:43,911
But whatever you do, don't run.

343
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:46,726
Do not run.

344
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:52,863
- Don't run.
- Don't run. Got it.

345
00:58:58,686 --> 00:59:01,068
All right, here. Eat.

346
01:00:11,387 --> 01:00:13,824
Morning, Jennifer.

347
01:00:14,324 --> 01:00:18,867
Just beginning to wonder if your
disappearance was a problem or a solution.

348
01:00:20,427 --> 01:00:23,744
Bart? My name's Mackenzie.

349
01:00:25,464 --> 01:00:29,335
- What?
- My name's not Jennifer, it's Mackenzie.

350
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:39,791
Whatever.

351
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:45,996
Want some breakfast?

352
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:59,499
Get under the tarp.

353
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:12,364
This is fuckin' cool, this setup.

354
01:02:12,464 --> 01:02:16,880
- So now we...
- We wait. Stop swearing.

355
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,139
Find the smallest one. See that
smallest one? Right by your right foot.

356
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:46,425
Roll it up, stick it in here.
That's right, yeah.

357
01:02:46,525 --> 01:02:48,974
Just take the end of that little hole.

358
01:02:56,232 --> 01:02:59,435
<i>You know, I do actually like the outdoors.</i>

359
01:02:59,535 --> 01:03:02,051
Something in common.

360
01:03:16,448 --> 01:03:18,731
Everything's wet.

361
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:22,521
It's not wet. It's just...

362
01:03:24,021 --> 01:03:28,671
damp. Just leave it on.
It'll dry faster that way.

363
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,274
Okay.

364
01:03:38,298 --> 01:03:40,647
Even the cards are old.

365
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:47,652
I've had them a long time.

366
01:04:47,561 --> 01:04:51,428
- Jesus, Bart.
- Don't... don't move. Don't move.

367
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,017
It's okay.

368
01:05:12,147 --> 01:05:15,149
Slowly, it's okay.

369
01:05:15,249 --> 01:05:17,065
Slowly.

370
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:30,511
Look at it.

371
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:43,423
Come on.

372
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:19,322
Who's Carolyn?

373
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:32,901
She was my wife.

374
01:06:34,854 --> 01:06:37,171
She died last year.

375
01:06:39,657 --> 01:06:41,540
I'm sorry.

376
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,714
We honeymooned up here.

377
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:53,102
Flipped a coin.
Heads, we'd go to Alaska, tails, Mexico.

378
01:06:53,202 --> 01:06:58,140
It was just kind
of a dumb idea, really, but...

379
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,190
then we just kept coming back here.

380
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:11,451
Guess you're by yourself now she's...

381
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:14,134
We didn't have kids, so...

382
01:07:21,592 --> 01:07:24,076
My dad died last year.

383
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:33,050
I'm sorry, too, then.

384
01:07:34,169 --> 01:07:38,320
It's fine. It's okay. I'm fine.

385
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:44,010
Your wife...

386
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:46,292
how'd she die?

387
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,919
Cancer.

388
01:07:55,719 --> 01:07:58,201
She had it a while.

389
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:04,407
I knew it, I felt it... something.

390
01:08:09,463 --> 01:08:14,334
And she wanted to go south to see
her family and come up here.

391
01:08:14,434 --> 01:08:18,305
I... I said no.

392
01:08:18,905 --> 01:08:22,809
'Cause of the... the treatments...

393
01:08:23,409 --> 01:08:26,445
which was stupid because...
all the treatments pretty much failed.

394
01:08:26,545 --> 01:08:29,861
They all... everything failed.

395
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:35,299
And she didn't get a chance
to come back up here...

396
01:08:38,887 --> 01:08:41,237
didn't see her family.

397
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:51,249
I told myself that it was
because I was afraid to scare her...

398
01:08:51,998 --> 01:08:54,018
but really...

399
01:08:55,568 --> 01:08:59,071
it was because I was afraid
to watch her say her goodbyes

400
01:08:59,171 --> 01:09:02,087
because I just didn't want it to be real.

401
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,260
But it was real.

402
01:09:21,922 --> 01:09:24,406
Do you think she's still here?

403
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:30,510
That would be nice.

404
01:10:22,746 --> 01:10:24,696
You're awake.

405
01:10:57,613 --> 01:10:59,215
Get off.

406
01:10:59,315 --> 01:11:02,732
God, what are you... what are you doing?

407
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:10,257
Jesus Christ.

408
01:11:10,357 --> 01:11:14,740
Now what the hell gave you that idea?
I... How old are you, really?

409
01:11:16,226 --> 01:11:18,743
God, Jesus.

410
01:11:28,871 --> 01:11:31,508
I don't... I don't need this...

411
01:11:31,608 --> 01:11:34,725
whatever this is.

412
01:11:37,646 --> 01:11:39,696
I don't need it.

413
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:28,331
I rented a car, do you want
to go get a bite to eat?

414
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,700
Yeah.

415
01:13:50,803 --> 01:13:52,772
How about some more
hot water for that tea?

416
01:13:52,872 --> 01:13:56,022
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

417
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,582
Will you get me just an oatmeal and...

418
01:14:04,682 --> 01:14:06,564
and...

419
01:14:08,083 --> 01:14:10,921
I have to go to the bathroom,
I'll be back in just a...

420
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:56,916
<i>Kenz?</i>

421
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,917
Let me talk to Mom.

422
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:02,620
- <i>Oh, thank God, are you okay?</i>
- I want to talk to her!

423
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,889
<i>Just let me come and get you,
and we'll go see her.</i>

424
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:07,724
You fucking lied to me!
What did you tell her?

425
01:16:07,824 --> 01:16:12,743
<i>I didn't tell her what happened.
I didn't want her to think bad of you.</i>

426
01:16:14,563 --> 01:16:17,126
<i>I think we screwed up.</i>

427
01:16:18,266 --> 01:16:21,217
<i>You must be feeling the same way.</i>

428
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,824
<i>You know, you're the only one
I can talk to about this, just you.</i>

429
01:16:29,909 --> 01:16:33,380
<i>I know you feel like I broke
your trust, and...</i>

430
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,249
<i>I'm sorry for that,
but this is for both of us, Kenz.</i>

431
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:40,186
<i>For you and me, so,
please just think about it.</i>

432
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:42,788
<i>We're in this together.</i>

433
01:16:42,888 --> 01:16:47,039
<i>Just you and me, so we have
to trust each other, okay?</i>

434
01:16:48,624 --> 01:16:51,294
<i>So come back
and I'll do whatever you need.</i>

435
01:16:51,394 --> 01:16:53,963
- <i>I'll take care of you...</i>
- I don't need your help.

436
01:16:54,063 --> 01:16:57,683
- I've got someone who's helping me.
- <i>Who? Who did you meet?</i>

437
01:16:57,783 --> 01:17:01,503
<i>Kenzie, listen to me,
right now, you need to be very...</i>

438
01:17:01,603 --> 01:17:04,532
<i>You need to get away from this person,
and you need to stay by yourself</i>

439
01:17:04,632 --> 01:17:07,875
- <i>and let me come and get you.</i>
- I think you're scared!

440
01:17:07,975 --> 01:17:11,244
<i>Yeah, I'm scared for you.
I'm scared something will happen to you.</i>

441
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:13,879
<i>I'm scared you're gonna get in trouble.</i>

442
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:19,535
<i>You're by yourself right now. Listen,
you need to be very careful right now.</i>

443
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,065
<i>Are you there?</i>

444
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:29,677
<i>Are you there? Hello?</i>

445
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:34,197
<i>Just tell me where you are and I'll send
some money so you can get around, okay?</i>

446
01:17:34,297 --> 01:17:36,365
Look, I have money.

447
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:38,967
I can just get anywhere,
I could get a ferry...

448
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:41,219
<i>Okay, let's meet on the ferry.</i>

449
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:44,822
- <i>The next one to Juneau.</i>
- What? No, I didn't say that.

450
01:17:44,922 --> 01:17:47,574
<i>Kenzie, I know where you are.</i>

451
01:17:47,674 --> 01:17:50,009
<i>The police, they called me.</i>

452
01:17:50,109 --> 01:17:52,844
<i>So just stay there, okay?
And I'll be there in a few hours.</i>

453
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:54,993
<i>No police...</i>

454
01:18:40,688 --> 01:18:43,238
Bart! Bart!

455
01:18:44,526 --> 01:18:46,815
Open the door!

456
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:51,064
- I don't... Mackenzie...
- Drive, just drive.

457
01:18:51,164 --> 01:18:54,247
Just fucking drive, you don't understand!

458
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:57,502
You think you do, but you don't!

459
01:18:58,002 --> 01:19:01,505
Why won't you listen to me? I'm trying.

460
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:05,454
Please, just drive.

461
01:21:00,848 --> 01:21:02,984
Why are we stopping?

462
01:21:03,084 --> 01:21:04,967
Rest stop.

463
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:06,044
Oh, hey, sorry about that!

464
01:22:06,144 --> 01:22:09,180
Probably shouldn't have been
flying so close to the road,

465
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,178
but usually it's pretty desolate.
Sorry about that.

466
01:22:12,278 --> 01:22:15,084
- Yeah, apologies.
- How you guys doing?

467
01:22:15,184 --> 01:22:16,852
- Morning.
- Morning.

468
01:22:16,952 --> 01:22:18,770
- Hey.
- Fly kites out here?

469
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:21,956
Nice kite?
Doesn't look like there's any damage.

470
01:22:22,056 --> 01:22:26,654
- You got car trouble? Is it all right?
- No, we're fine. Well...

471
01:22:26,754 --> 01:22:30,528
we're low on gas, actually, you know if
there's a gas station in either direction?

472
01:22:30,628 --> 01:22:34,598
No, to tell you the truth,
I have no idea. We flew in.

473
01:22:34,698 --> 01:22:38,635
We have some gas though, back at the camp.
You got a can, you want to follow?

474
01:22:38,735 --> 01:22:42,071
- A can, no, actually.
- That's all right, we got one.

475
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:44,472
- Hey, Jamie.
- Hi.

476
01:22:44,572 --> 01:22:47,574
- Masafumi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

477
01:22:47,674 --> 01:22:50,057
- Mackenzie.
- Jennifer.

478
01:23:03,388 --> 01:23:06,172
- Hi, Rene.
- Ide.

479
01:23:08,726 --> 01:23:11,042
Peel that for me.

480
01:23:14,563 --> 01:23:19,001
- So, are you from Alaska?
- No, I'm from Minnesota.

481
01:23:19,101 --> 01:23:21,014
Josh is from Alaska, though.

482
01:23:21,114 --> 01:23:25,038
Masafumi is Seattle, and Ide is Japan.

483
01:23:25,138 --> 01:23:28,155
We're testing kites.

484
01:23:30,508 --> 01:23:32,945
So where are you and your... daughter?

485
01:23:33,045 --> 01:23:37,214
- Niece. Niece.
- Where are you guys headed?

486
01:23:37,314 --> 01:23:40,683
Well, we're taking a little vacation,
we've been all over,

487
01:23:40,783 --> 01:23:43,052
went to Denali and...

488
01:23:43,152 --> 01:23:46,636
Spend the night,
take you up flying tomorrow.

489
01:23:47,688 --> 01:23:50,792
No, no, we don't...
we don't want to intrude.

490
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:54,176
You're not intruding,
spend the night. I mean it.

491
01:24:01,067 --> 01:24:02,907
Hey.

492
01:24:05,969 --> 01:24:08,005
Come on in.

493
01:24:09,407 --> 01:24:11,238
Come on.

494
01:24:13,609 --> 01:24:15,650
Here you go.

495
01:24:21,449 --> 01:24:25,053
- You know Josh, the pilot guy?
- Yeah?

496
01:24:25,153 --> 01:24:27,822
Built this fucking thing
right in his garage.

497
01:24:27,922 --> 01:24:31,926
Believe that? I wish he'd build me one.

498
01:24:32,726 --> 01:24:35,662
- You ever been up in one of these?
- No.

499
01:24:35,762 --> 01:24:37,330
No? Never had a chance?

500
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:40,666
Oh, you were scared? That's cool,
I was scared in the beginning.

501
01:24:40,766 --> 01:24:44,944
- Gotta get over that shit though...
- No, no, I'm not scared.

502
01:24:45,636 --> 01:24:48,653
Oh, okay. That's cool.

503
01:24:52,374 --> 01:24:54,677
Hey, how far can these things fly?

504
01:24:54,777 --> 01:24:58,447
Could this go, like...
all the way to Seattle?

505
01:24:58,547 --> 01:25:00,649
Why, you ready to go home?

506
01:25:00,749 --> 01:25:03,058
Oh, it's no reason.

507
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:07,514
Well...

508
01:25:07,614 --> 01:25:10,525
my place in question is Minnesota.

509
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:15,175
My mother's there,
and she is a piece of work.

510
01:25:16,261 --> 01:25:20,179
I couldn't fly this thing there,
and let me tell you, I wouldn't want to.

511
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:26,803
- How old are you?
- I'm 14.

512
01:25:26,903 --> 01:25:29,619
You're 14, oh, my God.

513
01:25:31,139 --> 01:25:34,343
That's funny. 14 years old.

514
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:37,746
What was I doing, 14 years old?

515
01:25:38,046 --> 01:25:41,663
Oh, I was... I was learning to shoot.

516
01:25:42,448 --> 01:25:44,084
Yeah.

517
01:25:44,184 --> 01:25:47,500
We had lots of wolves
running around and black bear.

518
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,555
Yeah.

519
01:25:51,155 --> 01:25:53,838
That's what I was doing in that summer.

520
01:25:57,710 --> 01:25:59,779
So you're probably...

521
01:25:59,879 --> 01:26:03,429
ready to get back to the city?

522
01:26:03,964 --> 01:26:07,015
This'll all be over before you know it.

523
01:26:12,505 --> 01:26:16,723
- Okay, it's gusty here.
- Okay, you ready?

524
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:27,018
<i>So...</i>

525
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:29,853
<i>what's with all the kites and stuff?</i>

526
01:26:29,953 --> 01:26:32,839
I grew up in a family
with three boys, and...

527
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:36,910
<i>my father used to bring kites
from Japan for us to fly, and...</i>

528
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:41,691
my older brother, Gus,
he and I would go outside and...

529
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:45,180
fly all day, almost every day.

530
01:26:45,298 --> 01:26:48,304
One moment I was holding his hand, and...

531
01:26:50,303 --> 01:26:52,986
he got hit by a car and killed.

532
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:59,692
<i>Then I stopped talking
and never went back to school.</i>

533
01:27:00,545 --> 01:27:04,286
<i>One day, my dad, he yells
out to me to come outside, and...</i>

534
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,484
<i>he was out there flying a kite.</i>

535
01:27:06,584 --> 01:27:09,753
<i>Takes my hand and tries
to put it on the string, and...</i>

536
01:27:09,853 --> 01:27:12,722
<i>I told him I was scared.</i>

537
01:27:12,822 --> 01:27:17,092
<i>And he told me, the wind's like life,
it's always changing.</i>

538
01:27:17,192 --> 01:27:19,260
<i>And the strings there,</i>

539
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,679
<i>they're like the feelings
that connect us to our family,</i>

540
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,195
<i>you know, to the people we love.</i>

541
01:27:26,632 --> 01:27:29,626
<i>To the flyers.</i>

542
01:27:31,636 --> 01:27:34,653
I've been flying kites ever since.

543
01:29:11,194 --> 01:29:13,871
A ferry to Seattle...

544
01:29:15,232 --> 01:29:19,069
goes through Juneau, leaves from Whittier,
leaves tomorrow afternoon.

545
01:29:19,169 --> 01:29:23,286
If you leave in the morning, you can
make it. Is that what you want to do?

546
01:29:26,573 --> 01:29:28,356
Yeah.

547
01:29:28,774 --> 01:29:30,591
Yeah.

548
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,997
- Are you gonna tell me what...
- I can't tell you.

549
01:29:35,097 --> 01:29:39,036
- What about the police?
- What about them?

550
01:30:22,724 --> 01:30:24,910
Hot chocolate.

551
01:30:58,022 --> 01:31:00,444
Thank you very much.

552
01:31:08,631 --> 01:31:12,301
<i>Passengers for Akutan, Juneau, Sitka,</i>

553
01:31:12,401 --> 01:31:16,685
<i>Bellingham, Seattle,
keep your tickets on you.</i>

554
01:32:20,467 --> 01:32:22,337
Sorry.

555
01:32:44,087 --> 01:32:46,956
- Where'd my partner get to?
- Jennifer just took the binoculars

556
01:32:47,056 --> 01:32:48,905
and went out on the deck.

557
01:33:05,603 --> 01:33:07,924
Excuse me for a sec.

558
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:06,499
Bart!

559
01:34:07,531 --> 01:34:11,081
- Can we go to the room?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

560
01:34:24,178 --> 01:34:26,074
You left this.

561
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:46,180
Well, I guess we should
get you back to Seattle.

562
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:54,538
- You know, I can go to the police for you...
- And what for?

563
01:34:54,638 --> 01:34:58,489
- Mackenzie.
- What? It doesn't matter, okay?

564
01:34:59,775 --> 01:35:02,245
Nothing happened.

565
01:35:02,345 --> 01:35:04,514
Okay? Nothing happened.

566
01:35:05,214 --> 01:35:07,063
Okay?

567
01:36:24,556 --> 01:36:30,151
<i>Juneau. This is Juneau.

<i>We are now fastened to the dock.

- Shit.

574
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:26,112
Bart! Bart.

575
01:37:26,572 --> 01:37:29,241
Why didn't you stay in the cabin?

576
01:37:29,341 --> 01:37:30,990
Don't look.

577
01:37:54,094 --> 01:37:56,265
What are you doing,
you wrote a text on my phone?

578
01:37:56,365 --> 01:37:59,401
- Don't worry, everything's going to be fine.
- What are you talking about?

579
01:37:59,501 --> 01:38:01,717
You got the map?

580
01:38:02,902 --> 01:38:04,815
- It's in my bag.
- Okay,

581
01:38:04,915 --> 01:38:08,473
- I'm getting off here, you're staying.
- What? No, Bart, he's gone...

582
01:38:08,573 --> 01:38:10,689
No, you're staying.

583
01:38:12,809 --> 01:38:15,678
- I'm gonna come with you then.
- No, you're not.

584
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:16,846
- I am...
- This is it.

585
01:38:16,946 --> 01:38:20,215
You're gonna stay on the ferry
until it gets to Seattle.

586
01:38:20,315 --> 01:38:24,185
- I'm gonna follow you anyway.
- Follow me, I'll turn you in.

587
01:38:24,585 --> 01:38:26,353
You're not listening to me,
I'm not gonna...

588

No.

589
