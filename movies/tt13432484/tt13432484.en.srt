3
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:17,394
Hello, my name is Ethan Hawke,
and I just wanted to talk to you briefly

4
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:18,763
about the new film
I'm working on

5
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:21,666
called <i>Zeros and Ones,</i>
by Abel Ferrara.

6
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:25,603
I've been a fan of Abel since I
first fell in love with the movies.

7
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:28,773
He's a completely unique
and extraordinary filmmaker.

8
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:33,243
He's got voice with the camera.
He has depth with his actors.

9
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:37,749
The work that he's done most recently with
Willem Dafoe has been wildly inspiring to me,

10
00:01:37,782 --> 00:01:40,283
so I was very grateful
to get the script.

11
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:44,656
Especially considering that the
script speaks to this moment.

12
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:48,191
Not in any obvious,
uh, didactic way,

13
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:51,963
but you can feel
that this is Abel's hit

14
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:55,767
on what we've all been going
through for the last year or so.

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,971
Uh, it's a beautiful script.
I play a military man.

16
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:03,407
You're not exactly sure whether
I'm a good guy or a bad guy,

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,476
and I also play my own brother,
who's a revolutionary.

18
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,781
And so, that's very dynamic
for me to get to play

19
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:13,383
these two characters that are
representing contrasting viewpoints.

20
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,586
I think we're gonna be able
to do something really special.

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,289
Uh, I consider the most
important aspect of my job,

22
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,726
who I choose to work with,
that's what actors do.

23
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,897
You know, we champion filmmakers,
uh, we champion voices.

24
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,533
And I'm excited for the world
to see Abel's response

25
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,804
to-to this wild year
we've been living through.

26
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,404
I hope you enjoy it.

27
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,318
<i>Yo, you good?</i>

28
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:30,087
Still here.

29
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,837
<i>All right, here,
let me pull it up.</i>

30
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,929
<i>Hey, let me... let me
work with this some more.</i>

31
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,266
What's it say?

32
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,834
You're still alive.

33
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,169
You trust it?

34
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:33,605
Come on.

35
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,623
That's the news to the world.

36
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:36,433
<i>It is
to religion that we call you.</i>

37
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,671
<i>The religion of sincerity.</i>

38
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:42,473
<i>The best manners,
righteousness,</i>

39
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,442
<i>mercy, honor, purity, piety.</i>

40
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,249
<i>It is the religion
of showing kindness to others.</i>

41
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,518
<i>Establishing justice
between them,</i>

42
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,021
<i>granting them the rights,</i>

43
00:13:58,055 --> 00:14:01,291
<i>and defending the oppressed
and the persecuted.</i>

44
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:10,334
<i>We call you to be a people of
principles, honor, and purity.</i>

45
00:14:10,367 --> 00:14:15,673
<i>That you may be freed from the deceptive
lies, that you are a great nation.</i>

46
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:25,549
<i>Do you now know why we fight
and why we shall be victorious?</i>

47
00:14:56,246 --> 00:14:59,149
Hey, shoot it
so they believe it.

48
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:28,479
<i>Symbol of Christianity...</i>

49
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,620
<i>death to the infidels...</i>

50
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,431
<i>The 3,000-year war...</i>

51
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:06,784
<i>Jesus was just another soldier,</i>

52
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:10,053
<i>another war casualty...</i>

53
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,695
<i>but on whose side?</i>

54
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:12,549
Hey.

55
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:16,320
Come up the back.

56
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:49,372
His father?

57
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,013
Your brother...

58
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:58,883
is still in prison.

59
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:04,555
Well, at least he's alive.

60
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:06,791
For now.

61
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:09,694
Are you sure?

62
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,663
You tell me.

63
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:28,012
Is that your rabbit?

64
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:31,616
Does he have a name?

65
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,389
What are you dreamin' about?

66
00:20:41,592 --> 00:20:42,760
Fish?

67
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,632
Porcupines?

68
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,941
Goodnight.

69
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:15,593
I only have tea.

70
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:16,661
That's fine.

71
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:41,052
Have you figured out
what you're doing in my country?

72
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,457
I'm workin' on it.

73
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:53,998
Lots of honey?

74
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:55,733
- Mm-hm.
- Right.

75
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:00,537
What's with you
Americans and honey?

76
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:26,797
You don't care
if he ever gets out.

77
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:33,905
He won't last
ten minutes on the street,

78
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,640
knowin' what he knows.

79
00:22:39,644 --> 00:22:41,478
How do they know what he knows?

80
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,948
You told them?

81
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:22,086
<i>I heard you're back.</i>

82
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:28,826
<i>Show him.</i>

83
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:42,239
<i>And they're both negative.</i>

84
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,245
He's addicted to the screens.

85
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:19,350
In another time and place,
it could be castor oil,

86
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:22,219
and I'd call you <i>partigiano.</i>

87
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,325
Made in Swiss...

88
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:32,463
made popular in San Francisco,

89
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:36,967
and perfected recently by a chef
not far from here.

90
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:41,438
It's quicker and more effective.

91
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:43,374
Ah, shit.

92
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,209
No... you don't...

93
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:05,095
Shh... Shh...

94
00:29:07,965 --> 00:29:09,099
Where?

95
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:15,239
Where... and when?

96
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:16,940
Okay?

97
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:21,812
It takes more than guns
to kill a man.

98
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,849
You think I'm your enemy?

99
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:28,252
Yeah, is that what you think?

100
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:36,860
Your fear made me,
and now, here I am.

101
00:29:38,462 --> 00:29:44,001
I am your enemy, but your enemy
won't be gone when you kill me.

102
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,171
You can't kill me.

103
00:29:48,906 --> 00:29:53,177
Try it, watch what happens.

104
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,414
I'll be right back after the
sound and the fury is finished.

105
00:29:57,448 --> 00:30:00,017
Where, and when?

106
00:30:01,251 --> 00:30:02,486
Come on.

107
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:07,324
This machine kills fascists.

108
00:30:07,358 --> 00:30:11,161
This machine is my voice.
It's the human voice.

109
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:14,898
My heart is the drummer...
Okay, all right.

110
00:30:14,932 --> 00:30:18,168
You wanna know... you wanna know
where the door is, eh?

111
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:19,937
Where, and when?

112
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,006
No, wait, wait.

113
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,174
I'll tell you...

114
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,610
I'll tell you...
I'll tell you...

115
00:30:25,643 --> 00:30:26,977
I'll tell you where the...
where the door...

116
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,213
I'll meet you...
I'll meet you there.

117
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:33,417
And I'm not afraid to die.

118
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,586
And you?

119
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,221
You're dead already.

120
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:42,226
I would light myself on fire!

121
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:47,364
How come no one is lighting
themselves on fire, eh?!

122
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,370
<i>How come no one is lighting
themselves on fire anymore?!</i>

123
00:30:53,404 --> 00:30:56,106
This country
was conceived in liberty,

124
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,646
dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

125
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,682
This is a battleground.

126
00:31:04,716 --> 00:31:07,985
The world is watching
what happens here,

127
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:12,523
and it is up to us,
the living...

128
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:15,325
to finish the work of the dead

129
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,128
so they will
not have died in vain

130
00:31:18,162 --> 00:31:20,964
and that a government
of the people, for the people,

131
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:24,101
by the people, shall not perish
from this earth!

132
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:28,338
Hail Caesar! Hail Augustus Caesar
'cause he-he got it, he got it.

133
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,374
And you-you, are you American?
You're American, right?

134
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:32,509
I can't see him,
behind his mask!

135
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:33,678
Are you American?

It's the law of
nature, nature's God.

147
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,480
We hold these truths
to be self-evident

148
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:11,716
that all men are created equal
and that they are endowed

149
00:32:11,749 --> 00:32:14,184
with certain unalienable rights:

150
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:17,087
Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

151
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,690
Do you know who said that?

152
00:32:18,723 --> 00:32:20,558
Who knows who said it,
raise their hand.

153
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:29,032
It wasn't one man,
yet you wanna kill one man.

154
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,335
All right, all right, all right.

155
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,003
You wanna know
where the door is.

156
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:36,173
Didn't you find it?

157
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,443
When you were
rifling through my bag?

158
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:42,112
Writing my suicide note?

159
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:46,083
Where did you
come up with that idea, huh?

160
00:32:46,116 --> 00:32:47,819
You learn that
from your scoutmaster now?

161
00:32:47,852 --> 00:32:52,222
Are you guys Boy Scouts?
Do you swear to be faithful and true, huh?

162
00:32:52,256 --> 00:32:57,762
Huh? Don't you even know
that your strippers are Marxist?

163
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:03,601
Your shoemakers are my soldiers?

164
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:08,405
That your cameraman
is my brother, huh?

165
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:12,777
Nobody living's ever going to stop
me from walking the freedom highway.

166
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,748
Nobody living's gonna
make me turn back

167
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:22,352
'cause this land
was made for you and me.

168
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:26,724
You don't know
how to work with wood.

169
00:33:27,692 --> 00:33:31,729
You don't love it, huh?

170
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:35,667
- You hate trees, that's why you hate me...
- Okay.

171
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,402
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, no!

172
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,772
Ah, fuck! Oh!

173
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:43,307
Oh, please, Lord,
grant me the courage

174
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,710
to love those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

175
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:48,646
Oh, please, Lord, grant me the courage...

176
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,448
...to love those who hate me
so that we may change the world.

177
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:55,118
Grant me the courage to love those who
hate me so that we may change the world.

178
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:38,388
So when is this gonna happen?

179
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:43,493
It has been happening
for a thousand years.

180
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:48,398
Is he here now?

181
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:52,837
He was born here.

182
00:36:00,377 --> 00:36:05,549
Do you remember how you felt when
you first put on that uniform?

183
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:12,489
I felt useful.

184
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:20,430
Did your brother
ever wear a uniform?

185
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:28,271
No.

186
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:15,753
We had a deal.

187
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:21,025
Oh, my American friend.

188
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,494
Always talking about a deal.

189
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,565
Hm.

190
00:37:31,002 --> 00:37:32,670
You still wearing your vest?

191
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:36,439
At all times, Captain.

192
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:44,782
So how are things with you?

193
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:49,452
You tell me.

194
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:52,957
Stop playing games,
imperialist.

195
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,726
You worship it.

196
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,696
It is time to live it.

197
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:26,023
Oh.

198
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,528
Where is he?

199
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:35,032
In training.

200
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,026
Don't move!

201
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:05,596
Don't move!
I said, don't fucking move!

202
00:39:34,158 --> 00:39:35,626
Fuck you!

203
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:28,045
You think we're playing
fucking games?

204
00:41:08,986 --> 00:41:13,224
Everything you need to know is on
this, in five languages.

205
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:14,258
Get it?

206
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:26,637
Study it, destroy it,
make it happen.

207
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,268
Oh!

208
00:42:40,277 --> 00:42:42,413
Oh...

209
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,052
- It's funnier in Russian.
- Yeah.

210
00:42:55,025 --> 00:42:57,027
<i>It looks like Moscow...</i>

211
00:42:59,363 --> 00:43:01,966
That's happenin' here
in real time.

212
00:43:03,434 --> 00:43:05,703
The waiter's filmin' this.

213
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,882
The last thing he'll ever do.

214
00:43:21,485 --> 00:43:23,187
You recognize the guy?

215
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:26,724
Looks like the boss.

216
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:28,292
And the other guy?

217
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:30,861
His boss.

218
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,404
<i>Looks like what he is.
Russian SVR.</i>

219
00:43:40,437 --> 00:43:44,875
I want to drink
for our future big success.

220
00:43:44,909 --> 00:43:45,976
Very good.

221
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:50,748
- To our friendship.
- Yes.

222
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,329
<i>They look like
they could be sisters.</i>

223
00:44:14,205 --> 00:44:15,406
Know them?

224
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,976
Your brother's dead.

225
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:00,751
We're negotiatin' for his body.

226
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,537
<i>This is really
how he wants to die?</i>

227
00:45:24,174 --> 00:45:28,412
<i>I paid dearly for the words
you put into my mouth.</i>

228
00:45:28,445 --> 00:45:31,482
<i>You fooled me
that I can see the hereafter.</i>

229
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:20,457
The time has come.

230
00:47:23,994 --> 00:47:27,531
It was told to me
from the Holy Father...

231
00:47:29,634 --> 00:47:31,603
in his prayer.

232
00:47:33,404 --> 00:47:39,042
He wants you
to initiate the response.

233
00:47:40,477 --> 00:47:43,615
Ask help from no one.

234
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:04,401
They will all betray you.

235
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,539
They will deny
you even existed.

236
00:48:13,043 --> 00:48:15,078
Do you know
what happened to my brother?

237
00:48:16,213 --> 00:48:18,215
He has risen.

238
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:20,417
He sits with his father now.

239
00:52:44,749 --> 00:52:48,552
<i>Aiuto! Aiutami!</i>

240
00:52:49,587 --> 00:52:51,254
<i>Aiutami!</i>

241
00:52:53,457 --> 00:52:55,425
<i>Aiutami!</i>

242
00:53:05,036 --> 00:53:07,972
Okay, soldier boy,
hands up!

243
00:53:17,347 --> 00:53:18,548
Drop the gun.

244
00:53:26,691 --> 00:53:28,593
Nice and easy.

245
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:43,473
Get in the car.

246
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,389
Hey, relax!

247
00:54:32,422 --> 00:54:34,659
We're all negative here!

248
00:54:56,647 --> 00:54:59,449
When was the last time
you did some giga giga?

249
00:57:18,089 --> 00:57:19,256
Here's the deal:

250
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:24,695
You knock her up
and you walk out of here.

251
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:29,900
How's that gonna work?

252
00:57:30,668 --> 00:57:31,969
He's a doctor.

253
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:34,504
We have methods.

254
00:57:35,806 --> 00:57:37,608
Call it advanced medicine.

255
00:57:39,343 --> 00:57:41,912
Now turn that
fucking camera on.

Hey!

285
01:05:55,239 --> 01:05:59,142
<i>The world
is the hiding place of God.</i>

286
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:05,516
<i>You know who said that?
Jesus.</i>

287
01:06:09,553 --> 01:06:12,422
<i>To understand
what's outside of you,</i>

288
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,792
<i>you must use what's in you.</i>

289
01:06:20,497 --> 01:06:25,703
<i>If we hear only what we already
know, nothing new happens.</i>

290
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:48,626
<i>The hard road

<i>"I have done

<i>Being out of uniform

<i>Listen, soldier, convening with
the enemy is a serious offense.</i>

298

299
01:08:53,651 --> 01:08:55,385
<i>When?</i>

300
01:08:55,419 --> 01:08:56,453
<i>When?</i>

301
01:09:03,995 --> 01:09:06,798
<i>Did you plan on
keeping this to yourself?</i>

302
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:33,658
Have you talked to Steven?

303
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:36,894
<i>You just got him killed.</i>

304
01:09:44,836 --> 01:09:46,470
Where's my brother?

305
01:09:49,907 --> 01:09:51,843
<i>Your brother was an anarchist.</i>

306
01:09:53,811 --> 01:09:56,681
<i>Your brother was a communist.</i>

307
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,025
My brother
was a revolutionary.

308
01:10:15,867 --> 01:10:18,669
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where?

309
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,906
New York?

310
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:57,909
Shit.

311
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:23,734
When?

312
01:11:26,503 --> 01:11:27,805
Right now.

313
01:11:30,007 --> 01:11:31,541
Get the baby.

314
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:11,782
It's on.

315
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:15,019
Thank God.

316
01:18:26,123 --> 01:18:29,159
Well, the movie's over.

317
01:18:30,394 --> 01:18:35,332
Uh, when I first
spoke to you, um,

318
01:18:35,366 --> 01:18:37,401
I was really
just recording a video

319
01:18:37,434 --> 01:18:40,104
to help raise money
to make the movie.

320
01:18:40,137 --> 01:18:44,041
And now, uh,
we've made the film!

321
01:18:44,074 --> 01:18:48,245
And I just watched it,
and you just watched it.

322
01:19:06,598 --> 01:19:09,967
When Abel gave me the script
and, uh...

323
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,340
script is a really, uh,
not accurate term for what he sent.

324
01:19:18,309 --> 01:19:20,377
I really didn't understand
a word of it...

325
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:22,112
Yeah.

326
01:19:22,146 --> 01:19:24,948
But I really liked it.

327
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:29,621
Uh, I did, but I didn't know
what was happening.

328
01:19:29,654 --> 01:19:33,324
I felt like somebody
was up to something,

329
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:35,392
and that I wanted to be
a part of it,

330
01:19:35,426 --> 01:19:37,995
but I didn't know
what he was trying to say.

331
01:19:42,232 --> 01:19:45,603
And now,
after watching the film,

332
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:51,609
I think what I began to feel
while we're making it is true.

333
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:53,477
Which is that you're...

334
01:19:53,510 --> 01:20:00,117
You can have kind of two
opposing outlooks on the world

335
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:02,654
and that they're both accurate.

336
01:20:02,687 --> 01:20:05,322
You kind of can
align your shoulders one way

337
01:20:05,356 --> 01:20:08,359
in which you realize you wake up
in the morning and you think,

338
01:20:09,426 --> 01:20:12,496
"Oh, shit, I'm gonna die.

339
01:20:12,529 --> 01:20:16,033
I mean, this is real.
I'm gonna die."

340
01:20:16,066 --> 01:20:19,136
And the world is run

341
01:20:19,169 --> 01:20:24,908
by corrupt, greedy individuals

342
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:29,246
and there's great tragedy
and disease

343
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,383
and the planet is eroding.

344
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:36,621
And not only am I gonna die,
everybody I know is gonna die.

345
01:20:36,654 --> 01:20:40,391
And brothers lie to each other,
and people hurt each other.

346
01:20:40,424 --> 01:20:46,497
And you just... you just don't know if you
can go on, or what the point of it all is.

347
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:52,002
And then almost
with-with the same ease,

348
01:20:52,035 --> 01:20:56,173
you can align your shoulders
a different direction and go,

349
01:20:56,206 --> 01:21:02,079
"I was born! Why was I born?
I'm so glad I was born.

350
01:21:02,112 --> 01:21:07,217
Everybody was born,
and the sun comes up and there're flowers.

351
01:21:07,251 --> 01:21:10,588
And guess what,
a lot of people are really nice!"

352
01:21:10,622 --> 01:21:13,725
And there's a kind of
pervasive kindness and healing

353
01:21:13,758 --> 01:21:19,463
that runs through the world
as it spins away.

354
01:21:19,496 --> 01:21:22,667
And there's all this
tremendous beauty!

355
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:26,470
Every child is a miracle

356
01:21:26,503 --> 01:21:30,007
and I wonder why I was born,
you know.

357
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,475
What I'm doing.

358
01:21:31,508 --> 01:21:36,346
Both those outlooks
are a hundred percent true.

359
01:21:48,358 --> 01:21:51,495
This is part of the movie,
by the way.

360
01:21:51,528 --> 01:21:53,063
And now it's over.
