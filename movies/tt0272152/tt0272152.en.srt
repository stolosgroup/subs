2
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:41,695
A dollar for a homeless vet.
Come on, little man.

3
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:45,266
Come on, little man. I fought
the war with your daddy.

4
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,635
Y'all ain't paid me for this leg yet.
Thank you, sugar.

5
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,603
Jackie chan! Jackie chan!

6
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,840
Shanghai noon.

7
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:56,677
I take traveler's checks. Arigato
to you too. Thank you, sugar.

8
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,686
Here you go. Thanks.

9
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,414
You kids!

10
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,626
Here. Hold
it right there!

11
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,328
What happened?

12
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:48,662
Step away from her.

13
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,698
Oh, man, he ain't done nothing.

14
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,533
Those kids. Who took your bag?
This man?

15
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,001
No, it was a couple of punks.

16
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,903
They came and they just ran off.

17
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,805
Four-eight, this is Romano.
Robbery and assault victim...

18
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,873
With facial wound at
east 42nd entrance.

19
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,009
Sir, I'd like you to
just stand right there.

20
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:05,546
Certainly. Are you
traveling somewhere?

21
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,582
I have arrived. My travels
are over for the time being.

22
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:11,485
Where's your luggage?

23
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,055
I don't require luggage.
Do you have a ticket?

24
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,291
Train ticket? Ticket stub?

25
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,927
I didn't arrive by train.

26
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,763
Would you remove your
sunglasses for me, please?

27
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:27,635
Oh, I'd rather not. I'd
forgotten, but I mean, wow,

28
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,770
your planet is really bright.

29
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,374
I see. East 42,
we have an e.D.P.

30
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,376
I have to ask you to
come with us, sir.

31
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,977
Of course.

32
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:00,734
Freddy!

33
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,072
Did you see this fella
come out of a gate?

34
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,108
He didn't come from no gate.
Brother came from nowhere.

35
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,478
You know what I'm saying?

36
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,079
Yeah, Freddy, i know
what you're saying.

37
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:04,858
I don't wanna go outside, because
there's things that can kill you--

38
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,965
thank you.

39
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,101
If you breathe all those
chemicals out there,

40
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,704
not to mention the cosmic
rays and the west nile virus,

41
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,205
and that other one--

42
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,808
the new airborne pigeon disease
nobody wants to talk about.

43
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,810
The new pigeon disease.
I've heard of that.

44
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,913
Another thing that's been
bothering me is the food.

45
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,882
The cafeteria serves lukewarm
food, full of germs.

46
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,151
You really need to do something
about that, Dr. Powell.

47
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,521
Heat is the only thing
that kills germs. Heat.

48
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,957
Point taken. We'll look
into that right away.

49
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,495
In the meantime, i want you to start
taking your medication again.

50
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,864
It'll help you sleep. And
you need the sleep, Ernie.

51
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,899
Sleep is good.

52
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:51,872
Is our time up?

53
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,141
Only for today, Ernie.

54
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,212
Two calls: Your wife, bring
home a bottle of wine.

55
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,582
Yeah. And Dr. chakraborty.

56
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,151
A transfer from bellevue he
wants you to take a look at.

57
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:08,589
Great. Who is it this time?
Jesus Christ or Joan of arc?

58
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,024
Dr. chakraborty didn't say.

59
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,053
He arrived at
bellevue a month ago,

60
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,756
suspicion of hallucinogenic
intoxication.

61
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,993
But, uh, he was found negative
for substances of any kind.

62
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,128
His EKG, his blood
value are all normal.

63
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,764
There's no sign of
concussion, no brain tumor,

64
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:54,167
no temporal lobe, epilepsy, no indication
of organic abnormality whatsoever.

65
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,104
However, after one month,

66
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,573
his amnesia and his
delusion have persisted.

67
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,276
He claims to be not human.

68
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,046
A visitor from another planet.

69
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,916
They administered thorazine on
this guy for three weeks...

70
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,886
At 300 milligrams a day,
and he was unresponsive?

71
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,822
How can you be unresponsive to
300 milligrams of thorazine?

72
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:16,123
It's impossible.

73
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,058
That's why they sent him to you.

74
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,928
Terrific.

75
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23,997
No I.D., no missing persons
report matching his description.

76
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,634
What's this?

77
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:29,236
He had it on him.

78
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,075
Well, let's hope extraterrestrials
qualify for medicaid.

79
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,679
He's here, doctor.

80
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,348
Thank you, Joyce.

81
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:46,219
Medical record 2-8-7.
Calls himself Prot.

82
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,192
This one's as gentle
as a pussycat, doc.

83
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,995
Come in. Have a seat.

84
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,932
"Have a seat."
Curious expression.

85
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,704
Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm--

86
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,173
Dr. mark Powell, chief of
clinical psychiatry...

87
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,742
Of the Manhattan
psychiatric institute.

88
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,211
Good. You know where you are.

89
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:16,984
Well, now, uh... Prot, is it?

90
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,387
"Prote." I see, "prote."

91
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,156
Well, Prot, we're
here to-- may I?

92
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,626
Please.

93
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,232
Red delicious. You
call this variety.

94
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,036
It's my favorite.

95
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,406
I'd like to begin
by asking you...

96
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,175
If you know why you're here.

97
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:45,178
Of course. You think I'm crazy.

98
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:52,152
We prefer the term "ill."
Do you think you are ill?

99
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,421
A little homesick, perhaps.

100
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:57,257
Really. Where is home?

101
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,426
K-PAX.

102
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,729
K-PAX?

103
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,964
Capital "K," hyphen,
capitals "P-A-X."

104
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,433
K-PAX is a planet.

105
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:10,037
But don't worry, I'm not going
to leap out of your chest.

106
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,173
I'm not worried.

107
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,743
It's just that I'm only
familiar with nine planets.

108
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,178
Well, actually, there are
ten, but that doesn't matter.

109
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,380
I'm not from your solar system.

110
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,851
K-PAX is about 1,000 of your
light-years away from here...

111
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,453
In what you would call
your constellation lyra.

112
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,822
That's quite a ways.

113
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,724
I'm curious. How did
you get to earth?

114
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,330
It's a matter of harnessing
the energy of light.

115
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,133
I know that sounds crazy to you.

116
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:42,970
You beings are eons away from
discovering light travel.

117
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,340
You travel at the
speed of light?

118
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:52,479
Oh, no. We can travel many times that
speed. Various multiples of "c."

119
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,249
Otherwise, the trip here would have taken
about 1,000 years now, wouldn't it?

120
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,322
What if, um, i were
to tell you...

121
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:05,225
That according to a man who lived
on our planet named Einstein,

122
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:10,430
that nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light?

123
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,433
I would say that you misread Einstein, Dr.
Powell. May I call you mark?

124
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,870
You see, mark, what
Einstein actually said...

125
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,139
Was that nothing can accelerate
to the speed of light,

126
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,174
because its mass would
become infinite.

127
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,243
Einstein said nothing
about entities

128
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,345
already traveling at the
speed of light or faster,

129
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,782
- at tachyon speeds.
- Tachyon?

130
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:32,385
I detect a note of skepticism, Dr.
Powell.

131
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,955
Oh, not at all. It's
just that you--

132
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:37,290
you speak English so well.

133
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:40,460
I'm amazed. Well, English isn't
that difficult a language to learn.

134
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:46,066
You should try speaking--

135
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,372
I'm-- I'm confused.

136
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,042
Maybe you can explain it to me.
Uh...

137
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,178
How is it that being a
visitor from space,

138
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,881
that you-you look
so much like me...

139
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,183
Or anyone else from earth?

140
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,157
Why is a soap bubble round?

141
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,060
Why is a soap bubble round?

142
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,196
You know, for an educated person,
mark, you repeat things quite a bit.

143
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,465
Are you aware of that?

144
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,136
A soap bubble is round...

145
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,539
Because it is the most
energy-efficient configuration.

146
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,845
Similarly, on your
planet, i look like you.

147
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,047
On K-PAX, i look
like a K-PAXian.

148
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:37,017
Prot,

149
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,252
why did you want to
come to our planet?

150
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,857
Well, I've been here
many times before.

151
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:47,194
But what brought me here first?
I don't know.

152
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,030
Pure curiosity, I guess.

153
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:53,066
I'd never been to a class
ba-3 planet before.

154
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,235
Class ba-3?

155
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,204
Early stage of evolution.

156
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,640
Future uncertain.

157
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,643
And if I give all my
possessions to feed the poor--

158
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,614
Howie.
Go on. Talk to him.

159
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,884
Go on.

160
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,853
You're really from... Up there?

161
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,157
Indeed.

162
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:21,128
I am from K-PAX.

163
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,997
What--

164
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,234
what sort of place is it?

165
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,536
K-PAX is bigger
than your planet.

166
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:34,574
But we are circled by
seven purple moons.

167
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,377
Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit,

168
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,047
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

169
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,548
Go on.

170
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,957
Well, K-PAX is most lovely when
k-mon and k-ril are in conjunction.

171
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,294
Those are our two suns. What you
would call agape and satori.

172
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,159
You finish your homework, Abby?

173
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,228
Yeah.

174
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,697
I lost another tooth.

175
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,534
Oh, yeah? Let me see. Hey! Maybe the
tooth fairy will come tonight. Huh?

176
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,436
There's no such thing as
the tooth fairy, dad.

177
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,339
There's just you and mom.

178
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,343
I fed them already. I couldn't wait.
How was your day?

179
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:47,680
Oh, 6:15 was late. Didn't
leave the station till 6:30.

180
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,582
Should have caught the
nearest beam of light.

181
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,684
You should have caught what?

182
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,587
Oh, nothing. How was your day?
Good.

183
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:58,658
Sent the deposit in for the house on the
cape for the last two weeks of August.

184
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,294
Which works out perfectly, 'cause Abby
doesn't get out of camp till the 15th.

185
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,330
Sent the deposit in?

186
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,498
Yeah. Come on, rache.

187
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,069
That wasn't definite. We were just talking.
I said maybe.

188
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,638
Maybe sometime in
August we'll clear it.

189
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:15,008
Maybe. Maybe we should start paying you
for your time. You got a family rate?

190
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,378
Oh, look. They
published my letter.

191
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,714
I spoke with Natalie

192
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,750
about going into the
after-school program next year,

193
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:26,386
in case i go back to teaching.

194
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,488
And this morning
my head fell off,

195
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,490
but I was able to sew it
back on with dental floss.

196
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:34,361
Waxed, of course. Dental floss?

197
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,429
Sorry. I wasn't listening.

198
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,331
Yeah, I know. Let's just eat.

199
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,070
Train was late.
I'm tired.

200
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,372
And to top it off, the city
is dumping patients on us.

201
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,707
I know.

202
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,249
You stink.

203
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,254
Have a nice day, sal.

204
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,191
I've been to 64
planets within our galaxy.

205
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,259
Earth is the only one
with your species,

206
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:08,561
homo sapiens, that
I've visited so far.

207
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,530
And
when did you arrive on earth?

208
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,599
Four years
and nine months ago.

209
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,567
So that
makes you how old?

210
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,537
In earth
terms, 337 years old.

211
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,539
I aged about seven getting here,

212
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,142
traveling at six
multiples of "c."

213
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,278
But really, Marko, it only
seemed like an instant.

214
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:29,716
Marko? Time may
warp at super light speed.

215
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:33,086
I'd say access one
psychosis nos.

216
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,422
That's glib to call
him a psychotic.

217
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,557
That's a wastebasket diagnosis.

218
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,560
Oh, yeah? He believes he traveled
here from another planet.

219
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,762
What's your diagnosis, jet lag?

220
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,432
Well, how come he didn't
respond to the haldol?

221
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,200
Haldol can
make you more psychotic.

222
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,769
It's rare, but it does happen.

223
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:54,274
Look. I'm not saying that medication
can't be a useful tool...

224
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,776
To help somebody like
this, but you can't--

225
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,680
he may be a good subject for the "betazine"
protocol. The drug's on clinical trial.

226
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:03,383
You want to experiment on him
before we have a diagnosis?

227
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,852
Do you have some other idea?

228
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,789
He's not a danger to anyone. How
about getting to know him first?

229
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,560
In the meantime, we have ten
new transfers to take care of.

230
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,629
You know, maybe
what's wrong with him...

231
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,732
Is that he is. Is what?

232
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,202
From the planet K-PAX.

233
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:01,140
Mmm.

234
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,381
Your produce alone has
been worth the trip.

235
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:17,290
Could
you tell me...

236
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,293
A bit about your
boyhood on K-PAX?

237
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:21,861
Where were you born?

238
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:27,334
You were, uh, born, right?

239
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,536
K-PAXians have babies?

240
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,272
Oh, yes, much like on earth,
but unlike you humans,

241
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,942
the reproductive process is
quite unpleasant for us.

242
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,445
Could you compare the effect to
something that I might understand?

243
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:41,381
Like a toothache? It's more like
having your nuts in a vise,

244
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:42,849
except we feel it all over.

245
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,219
And to make matters worse, the
sensation is associated...

246
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,589
With something like your nausea,
accompanied by a very bad smell.

247
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,892
The moment of climax is like
being kicked in the stomach,

248
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,595
and then falling into a
pool of mod droppings.

249
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,897
Mod droppings?

250
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,469
A mod is a being, much like your
skunk, only far more potent.

251
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,608
Uh, if it's such a
terrible experience,

252
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,845
uh, how do you reproduce?

253
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,582
As carefully as possible.

254
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,984
What are you doing?

255
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:21,821
Well, you just reminded me of something
I want to include in my report.

256
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:24,324
Your report. Yes,
it's our custom...

257
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,726
To compile descriptions of the various
places and people we encounter...

258
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,661
Throughout the galaxy.

259
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,603
Morning, Betty.
Good morning, Prot.

260
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,738
Morning, navarro.
Hey, what's up, man?

261
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,408
Mr. Friedman. Morning, Maria.

262
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,612
- I'm Vanessa.
- Just chill.

263
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,483
Morning, Bess.

264
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:55,655
She doesn't talk to anybody. Afraid smoke
will come out of her mouth when she talks.

265
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,391
Been here since she was a little girl.
Burned her house down.

266
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:01,528
Shouldn't play with matches.
Very dangerous.

267
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:05,865
It was an electrical fire. Why do
you make up stories like that?

268
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,000
Ernie has a very
powerful imagination.

269
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,006
Philistine!

270
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,945
Come on, Doris. You gotta come
out of your room sometime.

271
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:22,782
Look what I brought
just for you.

272
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,518
Pooh, pooh, pooh,
pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.

273
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,554
Do that again,
you go up to three.

274
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:33,660
Her royal highness never, ever comes
out of her room. Not even for eating.

275
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,328
No wonder she's here. I'm
sick and tired of this shit.

276
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:38,565
Every day, coming up here and
shooting food at me. I hate this.

277
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,942
The service here is atrocious!

278
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:55,515
Good morning, Mrs.
Archer. Doris.

279
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,421
I wasn't expecting any
gentleman callers...

280
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,556
Until this afternoon.

281
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,592
Excuse me.

282
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:21,107
You have a place set for two.

283
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,948
Oh, yes. Um... I'm
expecting someone.

284
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,750
How long have you been waiting?

285
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,985
Eleven years.

286
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:40,126
For some around here might...

287
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,596
Call that crazy, but I
prefer to call it...

288
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,132
Romantic.

289
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,068
Romantic. Like a, uh...

290
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:53,005
Waltz in the moonlight, or a...

291
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,975
Candlelit dinner...

292
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,545
Or a sunset. Oh, we have those.

293
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:01,514
On K-PAX, we have two suns.

294
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,518
They rise together only
once every 200 years.

295
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,153
And that is quite a sight.

296
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:13,893
He most definitely has a
sensitivity to white light,

297
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:17,697
but I think it's his range
that you'll find interesting.

298
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,966
What am I looking at?

299
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,703
He can detect light at a wavelength
of up to 300 to 400 angstroms.

300
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,440
Ultraviolet.

301
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:30,643
Of course, Prot's
explanation is that...

302
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:34,914
Due to his planet's peculiar quality
of light caused by its two suns,

303
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:40,520
K-PAXians are used to light conditions
much like our twilight most of the time.

304
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,555
W-wait a minute. Chuck,
I didn't think...

305
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,457
Human beings could see
ultraviolet light.

306
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,092
We can't.

307
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,978
Good morning, Joyce.

308
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:09,015
That's a lovely configuration
you're wearing today. Thank you.

309
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,752
Macy's. Come in.

310
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,899
This is so much better.

311
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:30,469
It's a lot like home.

312
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,786
Well, uh, Prot,

313
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,255
I was hoping you'd tell
me more about home.

314
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,826
Well, what would
you like to know?

315
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,997
Well, uh, do you, um,

316
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:03,002
do you have a family on K-PAX?

317
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,005
It doesn't work on K-PAX the
same way it works here, mark.

318
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:09,275
On K-PAX, we don't have families
in the way that you think of them.

319
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:13,245
In fact, a family would be a non sequitur
on our planet, as it would on most others.

320
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,149
In other words, um,

321
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:22,021
you, uh, you never
knew your parents.

322
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:25,157
On K-PAX, children are not
raised by their biological

323
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,525
parents, mark, but by everyone.

324
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,762
They circulate among us, learning
from one and then another.

325
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:32,264
Do you have a child? No.

326
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,036
Do you have a wife waiting
back for you on K-PAX?

327
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,038
Mark. Mark. Mark.

328
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:45,111
You are not really listening to
what I'm saying to you, are you?

329
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,315
We do not have
marriage on K-PAX.

330
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,884
There are no wives.
There are no husbands.

331
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:54,553
There are no families.

332
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:02,061
I see. So, um,

333
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:06,232
what about...
Societal structure?

334
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:08,768
Government. No, there's
no need for one.

335
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:12,972
- You have no laws?
- No laws. No lawyers.

336
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,708
How do you know
right from wrong?

337
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:19,245
Every being in the universe
knows right from wrong, mark.

338
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:25,685
But what if--

339
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:29,055
if someone did do
something wrong--

340
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:33,192
committed murder or rape--

341
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,194
how would you punish them?

342
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,167
Let me tell you something, mark.

343
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,236
You humans, most of you,

344
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,839
subscribe to this policy
of "an eye for an eye...

345
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,241
A life for a life," which is
known throughout the universe...

346
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:51,644
For its stupidity.

347
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,980
Even your Buddha and your Christ
had quite a different vision,

348
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,682
but nobody's paid much
attention to them,

349
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,383
not even the Buddhists
or the christians.

350
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:03,189
You humans,

351
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:06,225
sometimes it's hard to imagine
how you've made it this far.

352
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:21,841
Josh, be careful.

353
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,442
Okay, kids. Let's go.
The hot dogs are ready.

354
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:30,149
Hey. Where were you just now?

355
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,953
Come on. Okay.

356
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:39,258
Hey, kids, come on. Wash up.

357
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,993
Okay!

358
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:46,165
Josh. Now come on,
quit teasing the dog.

359
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,300
Josh, let's go. Settle down now.

360
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:52,071
- Here we are.
- Oh, park that right here.

361
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,507
Boy, that looks terrific.
That looks great.

362
00:27:55,541 --> 00:28:00,012
Steve, how was, uh, how was
your trip up from Princeton?

363
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,449
Not too bad. We even
stopped by to see Michael.

364
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,952
Oh, that was nice of you, sis.

365
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:08,020
Quite a detour for you guys.

366
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,156
Well, it was his birthday.

367
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,025
I know it was his birthday.

368
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,928
I sent him a card
and a nice, uh,

369
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:18,164
a nice, big check as usual.

370
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,933
It wouldn't kill you to pick up the
phone every once in a while...

371
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:23,069
And talk to your own son.

372
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:26,705
Thank you, Abby. You wanna
pass the potato salad, please?

373
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:30,076
There you go.

374
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,880
By the way, I put him through dartmouth.
He knows how to pick up a phone too.

375
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,983
I'm thinking of inviting him
for Christmas. Oh, great.

376
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:41,087
He spends Christmas
with his mother.

377
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,956
He won't come here. How do you know?
When was the last time you asked him?

378
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,358
Am I on the couch here, or what?

379
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,128
You want a beer?
Please and thank you.

380
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:50,963
You want some more? Can
I have corn, darling?

381
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:59,038
Steve, I, uh,

382
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,808
I have a rather unusual
favor to ask you.

383
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,310
What can I do you for, Dr. "p"?
Well, I have a patient.

384
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:07,146
Sit down. I have this
patient, who, uh,

385
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:09,215
seems to know quite a
bit about your field.

386
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,383
A patient who's an astronomer?

387
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,453
So, tell me about this
patient of yours.

388
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:19,491
Well, he, uh, he claims to come
from a planet he calls K-PAX.

389
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,128
What kind of name is that?
K-PAX?

390
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:27,533
He says it's a thousand light-years
away, near the constellation lyra.

391
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:31,170
Uh-huh. Big head? Green?
About this high?

392
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,272
Yeah, I think i know the guy.

393
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,042
No, he's, uh, he's
very convincing.

394
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:44,016
I mean, of course,
he's, uh, he's human.

395
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,218
It's just that he's, um,

396
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:50,456
well, he's-he's the most convincing
delusional I've ever come across.

397
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:54,961
If I can prove to him that this K-PAX
is just a figment of his imagination,

398
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:58,297
then maybe I can find
out who he really is.

399
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,300
Well, sure. I can give you...

400
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,402
A whole list of questions to
ask your fella. Wonderful.

401
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,574
All his books and
papers and everything...

402
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:13,445
Are spread all over the desk like
always, but he's just sitting there.

403
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,447
Someone change his medication?

404
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,218
I gave him his usual,
anafronil, 250 milligrams.

405
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,326
Hmm. Well,
something's wrong with him.

406
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,830
An obsessive-compulsive doesn't just
sit there looking out the window.

407
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:42,241
Howie?

408
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,082
Good morning, Dr. Powell.

409
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:54,086
Good morning. But are you
looking for something?

410
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,122
Bluebird.

411
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,290
The bluebird?

412
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:00,259
The bluebird of happiness.

413
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,932
Prot told me to find the
bluebird of happiness.

414
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,600
Prot told you.

415
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,536
It's a task.

416
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,404
The first of three.

417
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,309
I don't know what the
other two are yet.

418
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:20,246
He'll tell me.

419
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,250
If I complete all three,

420
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,218
I'll be cured.

421
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,333
There. Maintain
your breathing.

422
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:44,203
That's it. Now you see?

423
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,572
There are none of these ammonia
particles that you're so worried about.

424
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:49,641
In the first place, i would be able
to see them. Good morning, sal.

425
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,410
And I don't. Good morning, Dr.
stinky.

426
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,912
Ringed monkey, 7:00.

427
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,020
Take a bath. Take a bath.

428
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:04,356
Ernie, could you excuse us for
a moment, please? Mm-hmm.

429
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,292
Good to, uh, see you
outside, Ernie.

430
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:09,595
Thank you. Oh, Ernie, you stink.

431
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:13,265
Prot, it's one thing to take an
interest in your fellow patients.

432
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,068
It's quite another to make them
think that you can cure them.

433
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,170
You seem overly upset, mark.

434
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:22,074
To borrow a phrase from
navarro, you need to chill.

435
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,711
For your information, all beings have
the capacity to cure themselves, mark.

436
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,014
This is something we've known
on K-PAX for millions of years.

437
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:32,351
Listen to me. On this planet,
I'm a doctor, you're a patient.

438
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:36,022
Doctor. Patient. Curious
human distinction.

439
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:39,191
It's not your job to cure Howie.

440
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:42,128
Or Ernie or Maria or anyone else.
It's mine.

441
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,996
Then why haven't you
cured them yet?

442
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,636
Oh, by the way, here are the answers
to the questions you asked me.

443
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,507
I hope they meet
your satisfaction.

444
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,558
I don't
know what to say, mark.

445
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,195
I mean, this is-- this
is pretty wild stuff.

446
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:20,232
Gibberish, huh?
Well, not exactly.

447
00:33:20,266 --> 00:33:22,634
I mean, see,

448
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,771
your patient indicates
his planet, K-PAX,

449
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:29,708
orbiting an eclipsing binary
star system-- agape and satori.

450
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,544
Yeah. Near the
constellation lyra.

451
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,546
He could have looked
that up, right?

452
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:39,118
That's the funny thing, mark.
Not really.

453
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:43,122
I mean, except for my
boss, Duncan Flynn,

454
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,125
one of the foremost
astrophysicists in the world...

455
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:50,662
And maybe two or three
of his colleagues,

456
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,799
nobody knows much about the possibility
of planets in this star system yet.

457
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:56,034
It hasn't even been
reported in any journals.

458
00:33:57,303 --> 00:34:00,206
Tell me, honestly,

459
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,308
did Duncan put you up to this?

460
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,144
You know-- you
know, like a joke?

461
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:08,714
No.
It's no joke, Steve.

462
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:11,150
Uh, tell me,

463
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:14,686
do you know of any
missing astrophysicists?

464
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,524
Can't say I do.

465
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,760
But there's one or two around here who'd
sure like to meet this fella of yours.

466
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,296
Thanks a lot, Steve. I
sure appreciate it.

467
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:31,303
* b, a, d, c, b, c, d

468
00:34:31,337 --> 00:34:33,472
But unlike you
humans, the reproductive process...

469
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,207
- Is an unpleasant one for us.
- Start again.

470
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,877
* What way is it unpleasant?

471
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,879
It's a pain--

472
00:34:43,215 --> 00:34:45,351
*

473
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:54,760
Good. Not too fast.
Okay.

474
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,370
*

475
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,758
So, this is your
neighborhood, huh?

476
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,471
Hello, gentlemen. Sure
appreciate you meeting with us.

477
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,374
Thank you, Dr. Powell. We'd like to get to
the bottom of this just as much as you.

478
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:26,478
Thank you, doctor. Great. Let
me introduce you to Prot.

479
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,583
It's a pleasure to meet you, Prot.
I'm Dr. Becker.

480
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:34,386
This is Dr. Flynn.

481
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,655
Drs. Patel and hessler.

482
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,861
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

483
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,598
How many doctors are
there on this planet?

484
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:07,553
Here, Prot. Have a seat.

485
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:10,556
"Have a seat." Oh, shit!

486
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:14,860
Feel at home?

487
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,634
We found your notes quite
interesting, Prot,

488
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,604
and we'd like to ask you some
questions, if that's all right.

489
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,607
Be my guest. Good. Then
I'll jump right in.

490
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,009
Make sure you can swim.

491
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,745
Yes, well,

492
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:36,882
let's start with this idea
of light travel, shall we?

493
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:39,985
What can you tell us about that?

494
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,956
Absolutely nothing.

495
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,493
If I told you, you'd
blow yourselves up.

496
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,528
Or worse, someone else.

497
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:52,531
You'd be surprised how much
energy is in a beam of light.

498
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,967
Hmm. Well, then,

499
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:00,105
maybe you could show us how
this light travel works.

500
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,411
You mean a demonstration.

501
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,813
That would be... fine.

502
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:21,359
Adios. Aloha.

503
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:28,567
Well, when are you gonna--
I'm already back.

504
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:36,174
See, where I come from, Prot, that's called
"the fastest gun in the west" routine.

505
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,645
Well, I don't come from where
you come from, Dr. Becker.

506
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:45,917
Prot, you've indicated in your
notes that your planet K-PAX...

507
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:49,588
Orbits around the twin stars of agape and
satori, near the constellation lyra.

508
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,490
Well, frankly, we're
a bit mystified...

509
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,425
As to how you gained knowledge

510
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:55,727
there's such a planetary
system around these stars.

511
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:58,129
Professor, where I come from,
that's common knowledge.

512
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,669
This was
taken from the hubble.

513
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,907
We've computer enhanced it, based on Dr.
patel's readings...

514
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,510
From telescopes in
Chile and Hawaii.

515
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:15,747
It's the clearest picture we
have of where you come from.

516
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,688
What we'd like is if you could
diagram on the light pad...

517
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:25,991
The orbital pattern that your
planet takes through this system.

518
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:33,999
Mm-hmm. My pleasure.

519
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:34,259
I think that's right.

520
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,897
Steven, could you input that?

521
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,498
Already on it.

522
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:46,137
Wh-what's going on?

523
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,168
I take it my calculations

524
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,037
help explain the "protabations"
you've been seeing...

525
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,140
In the rotation pattern
of your binary star,

526
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:27,078
but have been unable to explain until...
This moment.

527
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,857
How--

528
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,859
how could you know this?

529
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,963
How could you--

530
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:47,098
every K-PAXian knows this.

531
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:51,069
Just as every child
on earth knows...

532
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:54,305
That your planet revolves
around your sun.

533
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,842
It's common knowledge. Isn't it?

534
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:17,863
What, um, what
happened in there?

535
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:19,898
I mean, you--

536
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,234
he could be a savant.

537
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:26,972
There-there are savants who have
painted flawless copies of Rembrandt,

538
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:30,375
who couldn't-- who couldn't
remember their own names.

539
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:35,013
You don't believe him, Steve.

540
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:42,120
I don't know what I believe,
mark, but I know what I saw.

541
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:54,265
I moved. I moved.
It's your move.

542
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,268
One and two.
Your move.

543
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,977
Bluebird.

544
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,382
Bluebird.

545
00:44:11,416 --> 00:44:13,184
You just wait till next game.
Bluebird.

546
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,690
Bluebird! Bluebird!

547
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:23,461
Bluebird! Bluebird! Bluebird!

548
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,798
Howie! Bluebird! Bluebird!

549
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:30,435
Bluebird! Bluebird! Bluebird!

550
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:33,204
Howie. Bluebird. Bluebird.
Bluebird.

551
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:36,007
Okay. Okay. Bluebird!

552
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,109
Where's the bluebird?

553
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:40,912
Look, bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

554
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:42,948
Oh, my god.

555
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:50,288
Bluebird! Bluebird! Howie!
Howie, get back here!

556
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:54,059
Bluebird! Bluebird! Bluebird!

557
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,261
Do bluebirds bite, sal?

558
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:58,897
Nah, they don't bite, stinkhead.

559
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,804
Hey, Bess,
it's a bluebird.

560
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:11,142
- Shit!
- Disturbance on two.

561
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:18,116
- It's the bluebird!
- Bluebird! Bluebird!

562
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,051
Bluebird!
Bluebird!

563
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,463
Bluebird! Bluebird!

564
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:39,838
It's mass hysteria.

565
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:44,042
Betty! Betty, what the
hell is going on here?

566
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:47,846
- Come here! Come here!
- Dr. Powell, come and see!

567
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:52,350
You see it?
Do you see it?

568
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:55,420
Look it! Look it! Look it!

569
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:59,457
What's going on here, Dr. Powell?
What on earth is out there?

570
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,994
- Just a blue Jay.
- A blue Jay?

571
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,135
A blue Jay.

572
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,072
Off the chair.
Everybody, get off the chairs.

573
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:18,076
Mrs. Archer...
Come out of her room.

574
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,116
Bluebird?

575
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:31,222
It's a bluebird?

576
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,026
Come on over here.

577
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:20,071
I know who you are.

578
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:25,510
You're the bluebird.

579
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:33,518
Good night, Bess.

580
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,493
And how are we today?
Oh, just fine.

581
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,396
That's good, Maria. My man.

582
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,572
Psst.

583
00:48:07,152 --> 00:48:09,487
Excuse me. Mm-hmm.

584
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:20,298
About that light travel thing.

585
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:23,301
I was wondering if maybe you
could show me how to do that.

586
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:33,111
I put up with the stink in
this place for ten years.

587
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:35,947
I wanna get out, if
you know what I mean.

588
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:41,019
I used the be the
doorman at the Plaza.

589
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,288
F-fifteen years.

590
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:45,390
That's when I started
to notice it.

591
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,161
Notice what? The smell.

592
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:52,597
They all stank.

593
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:57,168
I-i tried to tell 'em, but, uh,

594
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:59,437
they put me here.

595
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,973
And, um, and-and--

596
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:08,146
and this-this place
smells worse than all.

597
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,681
Except for you.
Y-you don't smell,

598
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:13,684
so I figured maybe
you could help me.

599
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:20,458
You should smell the York
blossoms on my planet...

600
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:23,061
In a gentle breeze.

601
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,464
Pretty much like
your sugarplums.

602
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,367
I would-- I would
like to smell that.

603
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:35,706
I would like to go
there, to-to your, um,

604
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,243
planet.

605
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:41,479
I'm afraid I can only take one
person back with me when I go.

606
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,620
Uh, I had my weekly
session with sal today.

607
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,656
He says you're
taking him to K-PAX.

608
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,692
In fact, I've heard from most
of the patients on ward two,

609
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,328
they all tell me that
they're going to K-PAX.

610
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,097
I wonder if that's a wise thing

611
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,232
to be promising patients
in a psychiatric facility.

612
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:04,102
No, no, no, mark. I made it clear
to each and every one of them,

613
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,737
I can only take one person
back with me when I return.

614
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,674
Return? Mark, don't
get me wrong.

615
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,710
I mean, you've been
very hospitable.

616
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:16,481
Hospital. Hospitable.

617
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:20,218
But my time here is almost up, and
I can't wait to get back. Back?

618
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,387
To K-PAX? Yes, of course.
Where else?

619
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,655
You're planning to
return to K-PAX.

620
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,792
You're repeating yourself again, mark.
Yes, I have one trip to take up north,

621
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,395
and then I am planning
on returning to K-PAX.

622
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:33,431
Joyce gave me these strawberries this
morning from her garden in hoboken.

623
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:36,534
They're delicious. You'll
have to forgive me, but, um,

624
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:39,137
but this is a bit confusing.

625
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,806
- When are you planning on--
- I'm departing on July 27.

626
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:46,177
Why? Why, uh, why July 27?

627
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,546
Safety reasons.

628
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:51,082
You see, I can go anywhere on earth
without fear of bumping into someone...

629
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:53,451
Traveling at super light speed,

630
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,420
but beings are coming and going
all the time from K-PAX.

631
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:57,588
It has to be coordinated.

632
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,726
You're telling me...

633
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,630
You're beaming back
to K-PAX on July 27.

634
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,566
At 5:51 A.M., eastern time.

635
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,822
Hey, hey, hey, honey.

636
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:34,625
Mark, you were just dreaming.

637
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,827
You were just dreaming.

638
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:44,302
Daddy? Mark.

639
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:46,371
Mark, what's going on?
Daddy's okay.

640
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,239
Go back to bed, honey.
Where is daddy going?

641
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,341
Daddy's all right. He has a tummyache.
He's all right.

642
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,510
Daddy! Get in bed!

643
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,545
And
when did you arrive on earth?

644
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:55,446
Four years
and nine months ago.

645
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,714
What's going on?

646
00:51:56,747 --> 00:52:00,318
Shh! Listen.

647
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:02,620
And when did you
arrive on earth?

648
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,622
Four years
and nine months ago.

649
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,424
Your years.

650
00:52:08,593 --> 00:52:11,729
Four years, nine months
and three days ago.

651
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:15,600
That'll be five years to the date on
July 27. That's when he's leaving.

652
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,736
What? To go back to K-PAX.

653
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:21,239
Mark, what is the
matter with you?

654
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:23,374
Rachel-- mark, it is
2:00 in the morning.

655
00:52:23,408 --> 00:52:25,210
What is-- what is this
patient doing to you?

656
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:27,778
He's telling me that five
years ago on July 27...

657
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:30,248
Something terrible
happened to him.

658
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:34,452
Some horrible trauma. I gotta
get to him before that date.

659
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,522
- Mom, what's happening?
- Unbelievable.

660
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:39,557
Nothing. Come on. Come on.
Let's all go back to bed.

661
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:44,195
Ah, I've got it!

662
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,763
Come on. Let's eat.

663
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:52,337
- Is the spaceman here yet?
- Shh. Don't call him that.

664
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,839
Spaceman.
Spaceman. No, no. No, no.

665
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:57,808
Whoo! Everybody, come here.

666
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,211
Listen, everybody, look. He's
going to be here any minute.

667
00:53:00,245 --> 00:53:03,681
I want you guys to just calm down.
Be yourselves. Act natural.

668
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,551
Okay. Spaceman.

669
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:09,954
Why, is he going
to zap us with his laser gun?

670
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:12,823
I mean it. I do. Here.

671
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,959
Oh, mom.

672
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:17,262
I can't believe i
agreed to this.

673
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:19,297
I tried everything else.
Rachel, look.

674
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:21,832
I want him to spend
fourth of July with us...

675
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:24,402
To see if a normal family environment
might bring something out of him.

676
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,437
Since when did we
become a normal family?

677
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:29,707
Please. Look. They're here.

678
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,477
I just feel uncomfortable.
Well, don't.

679
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,912
Joyce's son, he's on the
high school wrestling team,

680
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,814
and Betty's husband's an ex-cop.

681
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,884
Hey! Hi.

682
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:42,587
Hey, Joyce. Hey, buddy.

683
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,623
Glad you could make it.

684
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,459
Wow. This is my
husband, Dominic.

685
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:50,928
He looks like data. That's
right, embarrass him.

686
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,331
Welcome, Prot.

687
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,766
This is my wife Rachel.

688
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:03,508
How do you do? Rachel.

689
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:06,010
Thank you so much for
inviting me today.

690
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,712
Thanks for coming.

691
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:12,617
- Watch out. Watch out.
- No.

692
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:17,355
Shasta, no. Shasta, no.
Shasta!

693
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:20,558
Come here, good dog. I know.
I know.

694
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,461
Damn dog's never liked anyone.
Shh.

695
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:26,931
Oh. Okay. Kids.

696
00:54:26,964 --> 00:54:31,035
Girls. Girls.
Come here.

697
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,549
Okay.

698
00:54:44,582 --> 00:54:47,618
She says she doesn't like it when
you hide her favorite tennis shoe.

699
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:50,355
And she doesn't hear so well in
her left side, so--

700
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:52,056
So don't sneak up
on her anymore.

701
00:54:52,089 --> 00:54:55,660
No way.

702
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:02,600
Let's get some lunch, okay?
Let's have lunch.

703
00:55:08,706 --> 00:55:10,675
Let's go eat.

704
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,888
It's good, Rachel.

705
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,890
Okay, you guys, come on.

706
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,725
Careful,
careful, Gabby.

707
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,031
All right. Come on.
Somebody else want some?

708
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,033
There we go.

709
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:41,572
So, Prot, mark tells
me you don't eat meat.

710
00:55:41,606 --> 00:55:43,674
That's very healthy. Speak for yourself.

711
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,576
Burger. Burger.

712
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,745
You got it?

713
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,481
Yes, I want burgers, thank you.
It's good.

714
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:52,116
Everything
looks so good.

715
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:53,618
Pass me one of those hamburgers.

716
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,556
Come on.

717
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16,541
Give me a push.

718
00:57:56,106 --> 00:58:00,277
There's a photograph on the piano
of a young man with all the others.

719
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,713
That's Michael.

720
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:05,149
That's mark's son from
his first marriage.

721
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:08,519
How many marriages has he had?

722
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:12,156
Just the two... So far.

723
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,193
"So far"? No, I mean,

724
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,262
he's not out to set a
world record or anything.

725
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,900
But the young man in the
photograph, he's not here today.

726
00:58:25,736 --> 00:58:27,872
No, um, he doesn't live with us.

727
00:58:27,905 --> 00:58:30,274
You know, he's away
at college and--

728
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:34,511
and the truth is, he and mark
don't talk to each other.

729
00:58:36,981 --> 00:58:39,249
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

730
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:42,319
Probably because I'm a locked-up
lunatic, so what harm could it do.

731
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,656
Maybe.

732
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,293
Maybe that's it.

733
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:56,100
Dr. Powell's been trying to
teach me the importance...

734
00:58:56,133 --> 00:58:59,604
You beings place on your
biological connections. Hmm.

735
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:02,707
You think he means it?

736
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:06,811
You don't?

737
00:59:11,816 --> 00:59:13,618
Do you know what a family is?

738
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:18,288
You worry.

739
00:59:18,322 --> 00:59:21,626
They don't tell you that, you know.

740
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,598
You don't have a family.

741
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,302
No.

742
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,242
We don't have families on K-PAX.

743
00:59:41,278 --> 00:59:44,949
Well, you don't know what you're missing.

744
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,757
I'll get you some more lemonade.

745
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:02,833
* hula, hula all right.
Incoming.

746
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:06,303
That's beautiful. Thank you.

747
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,674
Fourth of July.

748
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:12,710
Thank you for inviting
me here today, mark.

749
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,712
You're most welcome, Prot.

750
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:19,016
Come push me on the swing!

751
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,153
I'll
show you a trick.

752
01:00:23,187 --> 01:00:25,355
This is called...

753
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,024
Go to the table and have a beer.

754
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,963
Okay.

755
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:34,932
But first you have to
hold on very tight.

756
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,934
Okay. Ready?

757
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,309
This is fun!

758
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:55,019
Come on, let's go! Come on!
Come on!

759
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:56,921
Watch out. Watch out.

760
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:11,836
Let's go in the water!

761
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:14,004
No, don't. Come on!

762
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:17,407
No, don't go. Don't go.
Let's go!

763
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:20,177
Hey! Let go! Don't go in the water!
Don't! No, don't!

764
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,246
Mom! No! No, you stay! No!

765
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,314
Natalie? Natalie!

766
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,284
Mark! Mark!

767
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:30,354
Prot!

768
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:33,223
Hey, this guy's as strong as an ox!
Betty, quick!

769
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:37,094
Turn off the goddamn water!

770
01:01:37,127 --> 01:01:40,097
Stay there, Josh. I'll turn it off!
I got it.

771
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,767
It's okay.

772
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,070
Prot?

773
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:50,507
It's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, it's
okay, Betty. Where are his glasses?

774
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,910
I got it. Are you all right?

775
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,980
Prot?

776
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:01,451
You're okay.

777
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,024
Is that apple pie I smell?

778
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,004
Sweetheart, you all right? Yeah.

779
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:23,808
He was pushing my daughter on a swing,
like he had done a hundred times before.

780
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:26,510
Not like he was some
alien from K-PAX.

781
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:31,816
I saw him. He was
connecting with something.

782
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:34,118
Some kind of normal life.
That's not enough.

783
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:36,086
He's a violent patient, mark.

784
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,422
He's not violent.

785
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:41,992
Something violent happened to him.
Something in his past.

786
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:43,861
When he was going after Natalie,
he wasn't trying to harm her,

787
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,529
he was trying to protect her.

788
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:50,067
From the sprinklers? I'm
not sure from what.

789
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,503
I need more than a hunch to go on,
otherwise i have to send him upstairs.

790
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:57,274
We need to regress him--
take him back into the past,

791
01:02:57,307 --> 01:03:00,077
find out what happened and
have him confront it.

792
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,813
Regress him? Do you have
any idea how risky it is

793
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,348
to regress a patient
like this one?

794
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:07,184
It's his only chance.

795
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:10,020
Claudia, we have to push him.
There's no time.

796
01:03:10,054 --> 01:03:12,456
He told me that he's going
back to K-PAX on July 27.

797
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:15,292
That's in three weeks.

798
01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:19,930
I think that he could become violent on
that day. Hurt himself, somebody else.

799
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,332
You know what the
problem is, mark.

800
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:24,168
You're too close
to this patient.

801
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:27,171
Everybody else can
see it but you.

802
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:30,074
I am transferring him to the
fourth floor, and that's final.

803
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:33,143
I know I'm too close to him.
All right, fine. I admit it.

804
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,045
Why choose this one
to save, mark?

805
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:39,850
I don't know. Maybe--
maybe because I feel...

806
01:03:39,884 --> 01:03:41,818
He chose me.

807
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,227
Has anyone seen Prot?

808
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:54,999
He went up north for a few days.

809
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:58,602
"North"? Greenland.

810
01:03:58,635 --> 01:04:00,570
Iceland.

811
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:03,540
You know.

812
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:07,244
He had a few countries left to visit
before he could finish his report.

813
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:10,147
Don't worry, Dr. Powell.
He'll be back.

814
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:13,083
How do you know, Ernie?

815
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:15,319
Because he took his glasses
with him, darling.

816
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,854
When he returns to K-PAX,
he won't need them.

817
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,634
Patients do not escape from this
institution. They don't escape.

818
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,970
There has been no
evidence of escape,

819
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:36,173
but obviously, I've notified
the police, social services.

820
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,309
I'm gonna have a great time
explaining this to the state board.

821
01:04:39,343 --> 01:04:41,645
I got psychotics on the fourth
floor packing up their sneakers...

822
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:43,480
Because they all think
they're going off to K-PAX.

823
01:04:43,513 --> 01:04:45,282
Claudia-- find him.

824
01:04:52,156 --> 01:04:55,025
Well, what
about city shelters?

825
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:57,661
Have you-- have you checked?

826
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:01,966
No.

827
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:05,369
No, I'm not telling you
how to do your job.

828
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:08,072
Uh-- thank-- thank you.

829
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:00,991
Dr. Powell, i presume.

830
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:03,393
Where the hell have you been?

831
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:07,197
Newfoundland, Greenland,
Iceland, uh, labrador--

832
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,567
all right, cut the crap. We've been
looking for you for three days.

833
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,471
I believe I mentioned my taking a trip
up north, mark, in this very garden.

834
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:16,606
"Taking a trip"?
You're a patient here.

835
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,077
You don't leave here without a discharge.
And don't give me this beam-of-light shit,

836
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:22,379
because I don't buy it.

837
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,550
What would you say if
I were to tell you...

838
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:29,019
That I don't believe you
took any trip at all...

839
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:31,055
To Iceland or Greenland
or anywhere?

840
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:35,125
That I don't believe
you're from K-PAX?

841
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:38,062
I believe you're
as human as I am.

842
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:40,397
I would say you're in need
of a thorazine drip, doctor.

843
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:49,106
Well, there-- there
is one way...

844
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:51,608
You could convince
me beyond any doubt.

845
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:54,111
Of course, i would
need your consent.

846
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,413
It's called hypnosis.

847
01:06:56,446 --> 01:07:00,250
I just don't see the point. Let me
tell you what your alternative is.

848
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:03,520
A trip to a place where they'll stick
a needle in your ass every morning,

849
01:07:03,553 --> 01:07:05,522
which may or may not leave you
with a stupid grin on your face...

850
01:07:05,555 --> 01:07:07,524
For the rest of your
days here on earth.

851
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:10,360
Is that what you'd like?

852
01:07:10,394 --> 01:07:12,729
Prot?

853
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,698
I want to help you.

854
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:22,572
What we're going to be doing,
Prot, is a bit like daydreaming.

855
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:25,675
I'm gonna count
from one to five.

856
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:29,379
On the count of three,
your eyes will close,

857
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:31,381
and you will find yourself
in a very nice, deep,

858
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:34,118
comfortable, relaxed
state of hypnosis.

859
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:41,191
One. Your eyes are starting
to get very heavy now.

860
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:45,295
Two. I want you to use
your imagination...

861
01:07:45,329 --> 01:07:49,433
And imagine small lead
weights on your eyelids...

862
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:54,338
That are just making them so...
heavy.

863
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:56,440
Pulse
rate is 40 b.P.M. Three.

864
01:07:56,473 --> 01:07:58,408
Keep your eyes closed. I'd be
concerned if he were human.

865
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:03,380
Let yourself go
way, way down deep.

866
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:08,318
Four. Let a wave of relaxation
move through your body now...

867
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:11,155
As you go down even deeper.

868
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:13,323
And five,

869
01:08:13,357 --> 01:08:18,528
going way, way down deep.

870
01:08:18,562 --> 01:08:21,765
You are in a relaxed
state of hypnosis now.

871
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:24,768
How do you feel?

872
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,539
Like...

873
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:31,375
Nothing.

874
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,245
I want you to go back in time.

875
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:42,152
I want you to recall the first
experience that you can remember.

876
01:08:42,186 --> 01:08:43,887
What do you see?

877
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:48,458
What was that?

878
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:51,795
What do you see?

879
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:58,402
Uh--

880
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,606
I see...

881
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:04,474
Casket.

882
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,278
Silver...

883
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:11,815
With a blue lining.

884
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:15,552
Whose casket is it?

885
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:21,358
It's the father of
a friend of mine.

886
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,627
What's your friend's name?

887
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:27,331
I'm not telling.

888
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:32,936
Do you know how your
friend's father died?

889
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,675
He had an accident at the
place that he worked at.

890
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,745
He was killed in an accident?

891
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:45,982
He-- he was hurt and
then died later?

892
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:49,353
Where did he work? The place
where they kill cows.

893
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:51,288
Where is this place?

894
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:57,627
The pulse rate just shot up ten b.P.M.S.

895
01:09:57,661 --> 01:10:02,198
Do you know-- do you know
where this place is?

896
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:09,506
I-i want you to relax.

897
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:13,610
I want to move
forward in time now.

898
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,682
Where are you?

899
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:22,852
It's nighttime.

900
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,954
We're in his house.

901
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:28,425
At the other boy's house? Yeah.

902
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,993
I want him to come outside.

903
01:10:30,026 --> 01:10:32,362
Why?

904
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,502
To look at the stars.

905
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:42,606
That's where I come
from, you know.

906
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,610
Is your name Prot?

907
01:10:49,513 --> 01:10:51,381
Wow.

908
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:53,750
How did you know that?

909
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:56,019
Where are you from, Prot?

910
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:00,457
I'm from the planet K-PAX.

911
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,826
It's in the constellation lyra.

912
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,629
Do you know all the
constellations?

913
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:08,832
Yeah. Most of 'em.

914
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:12,769
And does your friend know them too?
Yes, he does.

915
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,872
When his dad got sick and had to
stay home, they got a telescope,

916
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:19,543
and his dad taught him about
all the constellations.

917
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:24,948
But he's not interested
in those right now.

918
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:27,517
Why not?

919
01:11:27,551 --> 01:11:30,487
Something happened.

920
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,590
That's why he called me.

921
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:36,426
He calls me when
something bad happens.

922
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,328
Like when his father died?

923
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:42,065
That's right.

924
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,437
How do you know to come?
How does the boy call you?

925
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:51,408
I don't know. I just come.
I just-- I just know.

926
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:53,577
How do you get to earth?

927
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:57,013
I wanna go outside.
Can I go outside?

928
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,082
Uh, read-- read his
body language, mark.

929
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:01,718
I-i don't think he wants
to talk anymore today.

930
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,820
All right. Prot?

931
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,656
I want you to just relax now.

932
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,992
Think about the stars.

933
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:15,031
That's right. I'm gonna count
backwards now from five to one,

934
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:18,668
and you'll find yourself
wide-awake and refreshed.

935
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:22,439
Five. You're starting
to come out of it now.

936
01:12:22,472 --> 01:12:24,674
Four. You're feeling more alert.

937
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:26,876
Three. Even more alert.

938
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:29,446
Two. You're becoming awake now.

939
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,448
And one.

940
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:37,954
So when do we begin?

941
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:39,756
It's already over.

942
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:47,397
Oh, the old "fastest gun
in the west" routine, huh?

943
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,473
Let's find the locations
of all the slaughterhouses

944
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:58,908
operating in the United States.

945
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:02,145
I mean, how many can there be?

946
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:04,714
I don't know.

947
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:08,485
We eliminate, uh, the ones
in or near big cities...

948
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:12,856
And we concentrate on
small towns, rural areas,

949
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:16,693
you know, places where
you can see the stars.

950
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:21,164
Joyce, we only have six days.

951
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:27,637
Shall I bring the crystal
or leave it here?

952
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:30,607
I suppose I won't really
need it on K-PAX.

953
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,910
I don't even know what they drink.

954
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:37,113
Dream on, sister. He can only
take one of us with him.

955
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,916
Why the hell would he take a
stinker like you? He's taking me.

956
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:43,520
How dare you! I do not stink.

957
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:45,822
Nah, forget it, ho.
I'm the one goin'.

958
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:48,191
Yeah? Which one of you?

959
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:52,195
Okay. Who would like to begin?

960
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:56,733
Ernie. Uh, i-i was-- I was
wondering if it was possible...

961
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,802
For us to have cream of wheat instead
of oatmeal.

962
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:01,905
Not again. Howie.

963
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:05,074
I have a suggestion, because there's
really, really not much time.

964
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:08,244
I would like to propose
an essay contest...

965
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:12,482
To decide once and for all
who will go with Prot.

966
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:17,754
I've spoken with him, and he's
agreed to read them all by July 27.

967
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,956
So if anyone would
like to be considered,

968
01:14:19,989 --> 01:14:23,059
please state your reasons
in a clear, legible hand...

969
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:26,095
And return them to me.

970
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:29,633
Russell.

971
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:31,768
Yes?

972
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,907
Would I get to take
my Bible to K-PAX?

973
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,544
Of course you would.

974
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,879
We can finish
the essays later.

975
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,790
Now, I want you
to go back in time again,

976
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,759
but not so far
back as last time.

977
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:01,631
Is
your friend there?

978
01:15:01,665 --> 01:15:04,300
Is he with you now?

979
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,737
Yeah.

980
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:10,273
What's his name?
I'm not tellin'.

981
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,310
Prot, I would like to
know your friend's name.

982
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,780
Well, I ain't gonna tell ya.

983
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:23,687
Well, we have to
call him something.

984
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,855
How about Pete?

985
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:28,792
Well, that's not his name,
but whatever thrills you.

986
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:34,330
What year is it? It's 1985.

987
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:37,901
How old are you? One
hundred and seventy-five.

988
01:15:37,934 --> 01:15:39,803
How old is Pete? Seventeen.

989
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:42,906
Tell me about Pete.

990
01:15:45,074 --> 01:15:47,176
What happened?

991
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,113
Is there a problem?

992
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:52,916
Is that why he called you?

993
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:56,319
He's got a girlfriend.

994
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:59,155
And the problem is with the girlfriend?
She's pregnant.

995
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,324
He can see it all coming right
down the road. You get married,

996
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:05,662
have a bunch of kids, wind up in
the same job that killed your dad.

997
01:16:05,695 --> 01:16:07,897
He blames her for this?
Oh, no, no, no.

998
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:11,234
He doesn't blame her.
No, he just--

999
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:14,237
he-- how did he put it?

1000
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:17,306
He hates the chains that people
shackle themselves with.

1001
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:19,709
I mean, we don't have
all that crap on K-PAX.

1002
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:23,346
All right, Prot. I want you
to listen to me carefully.

1003
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:27,250
I want to move forward
in time again.

1004
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,253
Oh, say, two weeks.

1005
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:35,258
You--

1006
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,061
if you would like to open your
eyes or move around, you may.

1007
01:16:39,663 --> 01:16:41,665
Would you like to? I know that.

1008
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:48,905
Prot?

1009
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:54,978
Prot, when-- it's, uh,

1010
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:57,714
1991,

1011
01:16:57,747 --> 01:17:00,850
according to your
earth calendar.

1012
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:03,186
And your friend Pete called you?

1013
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:05,321
Not for anything in particular.

1014
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:09,292
He just... sometimes wants
to talk things over...

1015
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:13,863
With someone every now and then.

1016
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:15,965
Tell me about Pete now.

1017
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:19,736
He's a knocker. A "knocker"?

1018
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:22,906
A knocker is the guy that knocks
the cow inside of the head...

1019
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:26,009
So it won't struggle while
they slit its throat.

1020
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:29,312
I know. It's barbaric, isn't it?

1021
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:32,782
Does he still live
in the same town?

1022
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:36,319
Oh, just outside of town.

1023
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:38,988
He's got a little place,
but he's fixed it up nice.

1024
01:17:39,022 --> 01:17:43,392
It's got some... trees
and a couple of acres...

1025
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:49,733
And a river.

1026
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,440
It reminds me of K-PAX,
except for the river.

1027
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:05,749
Tell me, did he ever marry
that pregnant girl?

1028
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:10,453
Wow, what a memory.

1029
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:14,690
Yeah, they got married, but she's no longer
pregnant. Why, that was six years ago.

1030
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:18,061
I've forgotten her name.

1031
01:18:18,094 --> 01:18:19,963
S--

1032
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:24,500
I didn't tell you her name.

1033
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,469
Can you tell me now?

1034
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,088
Sara.

1035
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:55,865
Did they have a son
or a daughter?

1036
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:02,806
Rebecca.

1037
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:10,479
Rebecca.

1038
01:19:16,019 --> 01:19:18,822
It's her birthday next week.

1039
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:42,946
Chak, what's happened?
Howie tried to kill Ernie.

1040
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:45,181
What? He's fine.

1041
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:51,420
Ernie? I feel wonderful, Dr.
Powell.

1042
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,089
For heaven's sake. What happened?
Absolutely wonderful.

1043
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:59,062
My good friend Howie, he just
about strangled me to death.

1044
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:02,165
What?

1045
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:04,067
Son of a bitch, i love him.

1046
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,035
Ernie, I don't understand.

1047
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:08,938
You should've seen it.

1048
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:12,876
I was asleep. You know, the way I
like-- my hands tied and everything.

1049
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:15,311
He wrapped something around my
neck-- a handkerchief or something--

1050
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,914
and then tightened it.

1051
01:20:17,947 --> 01:20:19,949
There wasn't a damn thing
i could do about it.

1052
01:20:19,983 --> 01:20:22,451
Well, when i stopped breathing,

1053
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:24,487
he lifted me onto the
gurney, rushed me up here,

1054
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,290
and they brought me back
as quick as they could.

1055
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,558
And when I woke up,

1056
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:34,097
you know what I realized, Dr.
Powell?

1057
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,402
Dying.

1058
01:20:39,435 --> 01:20:42,505
Dying's something you
have no control over.

1059
01:20:43,907 --> 01:20:47,877
Why waste your life
being afraid of it?

1060
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:50,213
I'll sleep on my
stomach from now on.

1061
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,415
I'll eat fish with bones in it.

1062
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:54,951
I'll swallow the biggest pill you can find.
Bring it on.

1063
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:58,154
I feel good.

1064
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:04,961
That's terrific, Ernie.

1065
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:10,033
See you at our session tomorrow?
Yes.

1066
01:21:13,002 --> 01:21:14,938
I cured him, didn't I?

1067
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:22,145
Prot says one more task
and I'll be cured too.

1068
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:25,348
And then it's... Bon voyage.

1069
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:39,222
Tell me your name, damn it.

1070
01:22:59,342 --> 01:23:02,078
I'm gonna give you
a specific date,

1071
01:23:02,111 --> 01:23:05,081
and I want you to remember where you were
and what you were doing on that day.

1072
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:07,283
Do you understand?

1073
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:09,385
Perfectly well, my dear sir.

1074
01:23:09,418 --> 01:23:14,390
The date is July 27, 1996.

1075
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,393
I'm on K-PAX.

1076
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:22,165
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, governor.

1077
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:24,433
I'm harvesting
croppins for a meal.

1078
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:28,237
Croppins are a fungi,
like, uh, your truffles.

1079
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:30,273
Big truffles. Delicious.
Do you like tru--

1080
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:36,679
wait a minute.

1081
01:23:38,814 --> 01:23:40,783
There it is. What? Is it Pete?

1082
01:23:40,816 --> 01:23:42,785
Yes.

1083
01:23:44,153 --> 01:23:47,022
I sense something is wrong.
He needs me.

1084
01:23:50,426 --> 01:23:52,695
I'm now on earth.

1085
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:55,131
I'm with him.

1086
01:23:55,164 --> 01:23:57,733
And where are you?
What are you doing?

1087
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:01,637
By a river...

1088
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:05,141
In the back of his house.

1089
01:24:05,174 --> 01:24:07,143
It's dark.

1090
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,846
He's taking off his clothes.

1091
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,781
Why is he doing that?

1092
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:15,551
He's-- what?

1093
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:17,820
What is he doing?

1094
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,391
He's trying to kill himself.

1095
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,729
Why does he want
to kill himself?

1096
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:36,139
Because something
terrible has happened.

1097
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:39,108
Has he done something? Has he
done something he shouldn't have?

1098
01:24:39,142 --> 01:24:41,076
He doesn't want
to talk about it.

1099
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:44,613
Prot, I'm trying to help him. I can't help
him unless he tells me what happened.

1100
01:24:44,647 --> 01:24:46,815
He knows that.

1101
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:49,452
Well, then, why won't he tell me?

1102
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:52,555
Because then you would know...

1103
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:56,225
What even he doesn't
want to know.

1104
01:24:56,259 --> 01:25:00,263
Then you have to help him, Prot.

1105
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:02,498
You have to help him
tell me what happened.

1106
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:05,601
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Are you fucking deaf?

1107
01:25:05,634 --> 01:25:07,836
Time is running out for him.

1108
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:10,373
Time is running
out for everyone.

1109
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,143
He jumps in.

1110
01:25:14,177 --> 01:25:16,445
He's floating.

1111
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,481
Pulse is up to 140.
Respiration's at 30.

1112
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:20,149
For god's sake, man,
bring him back.

1113
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:25,521
All right. Listen to me.

1114
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:28,224
Listen to me.

1115
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:30,259
You can save him.
You're his friend.

1116
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:32,495
I am his friend. That's
why I won't try.

1117
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:34,497
Save him! No.

1118
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:36,499
I can't.

1119
01:25:36,532 --> 01:25:39,468
The cur-- the current
is too strong.

1120
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:42,238
There's no chance.

1121
01:25:42,271 --> 01:25:45,641
I... cannot. Listen to me.

1122
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:47,676
You've helped a lot
of patients here.

1123
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,613
You've helped Mrs. Archer.
You've helped Howie and Ernie.

1124
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:52,415
I'm gonna ask you to
help cure Pete now.

1125
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,620
Let's call it a task.

1126
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,923
I want you to let me speak to him.

1127
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:04,360
If he's listening, i want him
to know that he can trust me.

1128
01:26:04,393 --> 01:26:07,863
I want him to know that if it was Sara
or Rebecca that he did something--

1129
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:15,704
Get in there. No, no, no, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1130
01:26:15,738 --> 01:26:20,543
No. No, stay back. Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

1131
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:24,713
Oh, my god! Oh--

1132
01:26:24,747 --> 01:26:27,216
oh, my god!

1133
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,885
Oh, my god!

1134
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:40,829
It's okay.

1135
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:42,598
It's all right.

1136
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,702
Shh.

1137
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:48,704
That's okay.

1138
01:26:48,737 --> 01:26:50,473
It's all right now.

1139
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:57,413
I'm gonna count backwards
now from five to one,

1140
01:26:57,446 --> 01:27:00,583
and as I count, you'll
become more and more alert.

1141
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:02,585
On the count of one
I'll snap my fingers,

1142
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:05,421
and you'll wake up
feeling refreshed.

1143
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:08,791
Five. You're starting
to come out of it.

1144
01:27:08,824 --> 01:27:11,660
Four. You're
becoming more alert.

1145
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,729
Three. Even more alert.

1146
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:15,698
Two. You're starting
to wake up now.

1147
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,500
And one.

1148
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:29,778
Are you okay? Yes.

1149
01:27:29,812 --> 01:27:31,814
Feeling fine.

1150
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:33,716
Okay.

1151
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:26,068
Thank you.

1152
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:38,347
Is this-- is this area code 5-0-5?
Where are you?

1153
01:28:38,381 --> 01:28:40,583
New Mexico, sir.
New Mexico?

1154
01:28:44,119 --> 01:28:46,321
"Salva."

1155
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:51,494
Salvation.

1156
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:55,931
Salvation!

1157
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:58,534
There are a dozen salvation
army shelters in new Mexico.

1158
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:02,671
Albuquerque, las
cruces, roswell.

1159
01:29:02,705 --> 01:29:07,943
Wait a minute. There's one in Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa.

1160
01:29:07,976 --> 01:29:09,778
Santa Rosa.

1161
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:14,783
Guelph.

1162
01:29:14,817 --> 01:29:17,986
That's pretty damn
close to Santa Rosa.

1163
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,088
What's the biggest local
newspaper for that region?

1164
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:25,394
Guadalupe county observer,
covering Guadalupe county.

1165
01:29:25,428 --> 01:29:27,029
All right. Bring that up.

1166
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:32,034
Go to July 27, 1996.

1167
01:29:33,902 --> 01:29:36,772
"Swap meet, livestock sale."

1168
01:29:36,805 --> 01:29:38,807
Wait. Go to the 28th.

1169
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:40,709
Okay.

1170
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:42,978
There it is!

1171
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:45,848
"Robert Porter. Drowned!"

1172
01:29:46,949 --> 01:29:49,785
His name...

1173
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:51,654
Is Robert Porter.

1174
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:36,431
Robert Porter. Ah, here it is.

1175
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:39,401
Yeah, I do remember this case.

1176
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:42,070
It was about the biggest thing
ever happened around these parts.

1177
01:30:43,806 --> 01:30:47,142
He was a quiet type.

1178
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,813
As I recall, he was a real smart fella.
Kind of brainy.

1179
01:30:50,846 --> 01:30:53,649
Strong as a horse, though,
and worked as a knocker.

1180
01:30:53,682 --> 01:30:57,085
Lived about 20 miles outside of
town with his-his wife and child.

1181
01:30:58,921 --> 01:31:01,123
Sara.

1182
01:31:01,156 --> 01:31:03,125
His wife's name was Sara.

1183
01:31:03,158 --> 01:31:05,828
That's right.

1184
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:08,030
Damn shame what happened.

1185
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:11,600
You got time to take a ride?

1186
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:14,202
Yeah.

1187
01:31:39,562 --> 01:31:41,496
Well, it's been empty.

1188
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,067
Yeah, nobody comes around
here much anymore...

1189
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:47,235
Since all that happened.

1190
01:31:49,304 --> 01:31:52,608
Ain't no livin' next of kin
to give the place to anyway.

1191
01:32:02,918 --> 01:32:05,320
I had detectives come
down from Albuquerque...

1192
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,790
To try and piece
this one together.

1193
01:32:13,896 --> 01:32:16,899
Well, accordin' to
the official story,

1194
01:32:16,932 --> 01:32:19,768
Porter, he was at work when
this, uh, this drifter,

1195
01:32:19,802 --> 01:32:23,806
Darryl Walker,
come by the house.

1196
01:32:23,839 --> 01:32:27,643
Two-time parolee lookin' for trouble.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1197
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:29,778
Started out as a robbery.

1198
01:32:29,812 --> 01:32:33,248
The wife and the
daughter were out back.

1199
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:36,184
Sara?

1200
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:38,921
Sara?

1201
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:42,190
From what we can gather
from forensics and all,

1202
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:45,661
this Walker, he, uh-- he forced
the two women into the house.

1203
01:32:55,971 --> 01:32:58,874
Raped the wife,

1204
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:01,610
killed 'em both.

1205
01:33:07,115 --> 01:33:09,685
Porter, he must've come home
and found Walker still here.

1206
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:25,801
God.

1207
01:33:25,834 --> 01:33:28,704
Snapped a grown man's
neck like it was a twig.

1208
01:33:48,757 --> 01:33:52,828
*

1209
01:34:26,762 --> 01:34:28,931
Can't say I wouldn't have
done the same myself.

1210
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:04,466
*

1211
01:35:51,513 --> 01:35:54,449
Uh, the river's this way.

1212
01:36:27,883 --> 01:36:30,185
They found the clothes there.

1213
01:36:32,354 --> 01:36:35,290
That's probably
where he jumped in.

1214
01:36:35,323 --> 01:36:37,926
And this river can be
pretty treacherous.

1215
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,095
Even in July it's got
a hell of a current.

1216
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:44,099
Still, I suppose it might have
been a mistake, officially,

1217
01:36:44,132 --> 01:36:47,970
to declare it a drowning when
the body was never found.

1218
01:36:48,003 --> 01:36:49,704
Doc,

1219
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:53,308
if that boy you got back there in
New York is really Robert Porter,

1220
01:36:53,341 --> 01:36:56,111
I'd just as soon
not know about it.

1221
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:58,113
Know what I mean?

1222
01:38:07,149 --> 01:38:09,017
Mark.

1223
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:13,922
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1224
01:38:13,956 --> 01:38:16,558
Never do that again. I won't.

1225
01:38:16,591 --> 01:38:19,061
What happened?

1226
01:38:19,094 --> 01:38:22,397
I found what i was looking for.

1227
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:25,567
You sure? Yeah.

1228
01:38:27,202 --> 01:38:29,904
Wish I hadn't.

1229
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:41,683
* and I think it's gonna
be a long, long time *

1230
01:38:41,716 --> 01:38:45,120
* till touch down brings me round
again to find *

1231
01:38:45,153 --> 01:38:48,023
* I'm not the man they
think I am at home *

1232
01:38:48,056 --> 01:38:51,026
* oh, no, no, no

1233
01:38:51,059 --> 01:38:55,163
* I'm a rocket man

1234
01:38:55,197 --> 01:38:57,599
If you wouldn't mind
putting mine on top.

1235
01:38:57,632 --> 01:39:00,335
* burnin' out his
fuse up here alone *

1236
01:39:06,174 --> 01:39:09,044
* and I think it's gonna
be a long, long time *

1237
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:18,020
Prot.

1238
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:22,224
Have a seat.

1239
01:39:24,726 --> 01:39:27,695
You all packed? Ready to go?

1240
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:31,433
Quite ready. I travel light.

1241
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:34,202
That's a joke, mark.

1242
01:39:34,236 --> 01:39:38,273
You humans. There's
just no sense of humor.

1243
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:42,177
I doubt, uh, Freud
ever tried this,

1244
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:44,446
but before someone goes away,

1245
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,515
we usually like to send them
off with a little toast.

1246
01:39:47,549 --> 01:39:51,286
Scotch okay, or would you
prefer something more fruity?

1247
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:55,123
I will try the scotch.

1248
01:40:01,496 --> 01:40:03,531
Well,

1249
01:40:03,565 --> 01:40:05,600
here's to a...

1250
01:40:05,633 --> 01:40:08,303
Safe journey.

1251
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:32,026
Tell you the truth,

1252
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:36,164
K-PAX sounds like a
beautiful place.

1253
01:40:38,233 --> 01:40:41,303
I'd like to see it sometime.
Think there's a chance of that?

1254
01:40:42,737 --> 01:40:45,340
I think you should see
more of your world.

1255
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:48,443
As a matter of fact, i think you
should see more of your own family.

1256
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:52,180
Invite your son for Christmas.

1257
01:40:55,483 --> 01:40:58,186
I may just do that, Prot.

1258
01:41:00,322 --> 01:41:03,291
You know what I've learned
about your planet?

1259
01:41:03,325 --> 01:41:06,561
There's enough life on
earth to fill 50 planets--

1260
01:41:06,594 --> 01:41:09,764
plants, animals, people,
fungi, viruses--

1261
01:41:09,797 --> 01:41:12,567
all jostling to
find their place,

1262
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,270
bouncing off each other,
feeding off each other,

1263
01:41:16,471 --> 01:41:18,273
connected.

1264
01:41:20,475 --> 01:41:24,446
You don't have that kind
of connection on K-PAX?

1265
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:27,315
Nobody wants, nobody needs.

1266
01:41:27,349 --> 01:41:29,417
On K-PAX, when I'm gone,
nobody misses me.

1267
01:41:29,451 --> 01:41:32,187
There would be no reason to.

1268
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:34,756
And yet I sense that
when I leave here,

1269
01:41:37,759 --> 01:41:39,761
I will be missed.

1270
01:41:41,463 --> 01:41:43,298
Yes.

1271
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:47,335
Strange feeling.

1272
01:41:47,369 --> 01:41:50,205
You don't have to leave, Prot.

1273
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:53,775
I'm sure there must be some
way that I can help you...

1274
01:41:53,808 --> 01:41:57,812
To stay as one of us.

1275
01:42:04,919 --> 01:42:08,256
I will miss you, Dr. Powell.

1276
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,369
Oh.

1277
01:42:21,403 --> 01:42:23,438
And I have to finish
my report, but...

1278
01:42:26,408 --> 01:42:29,744
I seem to have
misplaced my pencil.

1279
01:42:42,424 --> 01:42:44,226
Take mine.

1280
01:42:52,467 --> 01:42:55,403
A much more efficient
writing tool.

1281
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:02,844
Adios, my friend.

1282
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:08,616
Prot?

1283
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:10,885
I wanna show you something.

1284
01:43:20,962 --> 01:43:22,830
That is Robert Porter.

1285
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:25,733
Prot, that's you.

1286
01:43:25,767 --> 01:43:28,570
You and Robert Porter
are the same person.

1287
01:43:28,603 --> 01:43:32,440
That's patently absurd.
I'm not even human.

1288
01:43:32,474 --> 01:43:36,411
Can't you at least
admit the possibility?

1289
01:43:36,444 --> 01:43:39,281
I will admit the possibility
that I am Robert Porter...

1290
01:43:40,548 --> 01:43:43,318
If you will admit
the possibility...

1291
01:43:43,351 --> 01:43:45,587
That I am from K-PAX.

1292
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:51,493
Now if you'll excuse me,

1293
01:43:51,526 --> 01:43:53,861
I have a beam of light to catch.

1294
01:43:56,564 --> 01:43:58,366
Oh, mark.

1295
01:44:00,902 --> 01:44:03,905
Now that you've found Robert,

1296
01:44:03,938 --> 01:44:06,808
please take good care of him.

1297
01:44:16,017 --> 01:44:18,953
* that nobody can deny

1298
01:44:18,986 --> 01:44:22,023
* that nobody can deny

1299
01:44:22,056 --> 01:44:24,959
* for he's a-- i can't stand it.

1300
01:44:24,992 --> 01:44:28,963
I-- I can't stand this!

1301
01:44:28,996 --> 01:44:31,733
I demand to know...

1302
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:34,602
Which one of us is
goin' with you.

1303
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:38,973
Well, I can tell you this.

1304
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:43,511
There's extra points for the
one who goes to sleep first.

1305
01:44:46,348 --> 01:44:49,317
Out of my way!

1306
01:44:49,351 --> 01:44:51,619
Oh, my gosh.

1307
01:44:55,823 --> 01:44:59,361
You never gave me my last task.

1308
01:45:01,763 --> 01:45:04,466
What's my last task?

1309
01:45:11,773 --> 01:45:13,975
To stay here.

1310
01:45:16,678 --> 01:45:18,646
And be prepared...

1311
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:21,315
For anything.

1312
01:46:20,475 --> 01:46:23,611
You look tired, doc. Why don't
you get a few hours of rest?

1313
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:26,481
He's not goin' anywhere. Uh--

1314
01:46:26,514 --> 01:46:28,683
we got seven hours. I'll
see you in four, hmm?

1315
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,652
Get some rest.

1316
01:46:43,831 --> 01:46:45,633
You're gonna eat.

1317
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:50,171
You need some food and
you need to sleep.

1318
01:46:51,706 --> 01:46:54,041
Chow fun.

1319
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:56,911
Oh, the place on Broadway with
the ugly lanterns in the window?

1320
01:46:56,944 --> 01:46:59,781
The mean waiter
always shouted at us.

1321
01:46:59,814 --> 01:47:02,484
Their fortune cookies never
had any fortunes in 'em.

1322
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,722
We never needed any.

1323
01:47:08,956 --> 01:47:11,793
I knew my fortune that night.

1324
01:47:11,826 --> 01:47:14,962
He was sitting right
in front of me.

1325
01:47:14,996 --> 01:47:17,431
Hope he still is.

1326
01:47:35,817 --> 01:47:38,920
Hey. What's up, man?

1327
01:47:38,953 --> 01:47:41,589
Look, 20 says he goes.
You're on.

1328
01:48:19,126 --> 01:48:21,829
Shit!

1329
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:26,768
Oh, damn it!

1330
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:35,577
Two minutes. You know where Dr.
Powell is?

1331
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:37,545
I'll buzz him.

1332
01:48:52,894 --> 01:48:54,629
One minute.

1333
01:49:01,035 --> 01:49:03,671
Here comes Dr. Powell!

1334
01:49:16,283 --> 01:49:18,185
He's moving.

1335
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:20,054
Repeat: He's moving!

1336
01:49:20,087 --> 01:49:21,856
What the hell?

1337
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:39,774
Wait for me, you--

1338
01:49:57,258 --> 01:49:59,761
Son of a bitch.

1339
01:50:08,002 --> 01:50:09,837
Oh, god.

1340
01:50:13,374 --> 01:50:16,210
Oh, man. Oh, god.

1341
01:50:16,243 --> 01:50:19,881
Call a code blue. Help me.
Let's get him.

1342
01:50:35,429 --> 01:50:38,666
Who's that? Beats me.
How'd he get in here?

1343
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:42,436
That's not Prot. He's
definitely not Prot.

1344
01:50:42,469 --> 01:50:45,406
Certainly not. Prot's gone.

1345
01:50:48,943 --> 01:50:51,012
Where's Bess?

1346
01:50:51,045 --> 01:50:54,015
Where's Bess? Bess?

1347
01:51:06,928 --> 01:51:09,030
He chose Bess.

1348
01:51:09,063 --> 01:51:11,132
Bitch!

1349
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:13,667
Good-bye, Bess.

1350
01:51:15,402 --> 01:51:17,972
Good for you, homegirl.

1351
01:51:36,357 --> 01:51:39,426
Bess went to K-PAX.

1352
01:52:01,983 --> 01:52:05,286
Patient
287, Robert Porter.

1353
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:10,291
How I wish I could say that
Robert sat up one fine day...

1354
01:52:10,324 --> 01:52:12,927
And said, "I'm hungry.
Got any fruit?"

1355
01:52:14,962 --> 01:52:17,832
Like most catatonics,

1356
01:52:17,865 --> 01:52:19,801
he probably hears
every word we say...

1357
01:52:19,834 --> 01:52:22,770
But refuses or is
unable to respond.

1358
01:52:24,305 --> 01:52:28,309
Nevertheless, i keep
him up to date.

1359
01:52:31,212 --> 01:52:33,514
Let's see. I told
you about Howie.

1360
01:52:33,547 --> 01:52:35,783
He got that job at
the public library.

1361
01:52:37,318 --> 01:52:41,455
And Ernie, he's determined
to be a crisis counselor.

1362
01:52:41,488 --> 01:52:45,459
The only one we're, uh, really
concerned about is Bess.

1363
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:48,129
You know, we've checked
halfway houses, shelters,

1364
01:52:48,162 --> 01:52:50,764
churches, bus stops.

1365
01:52:52,033 --> 01:52:54,869
Nothing.

1366
01:52:54,902 --> 01:52:57,304
Uh, we don't understand.
It's like...

1367
01:52:57,338 --> 01:53:00,041
People don't just disappear.

1368
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:06,580
July 27.

1369
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,550
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

1370
01:53:11,919 --> 01:53:13,821
Robert?

1371
01:53:18,425 --> 01:53:21,028
No.

1372
01:53:21,062 --> 01:53:23,430
Well, maybe it'll come to you.

1373
01:53:26,067 --> 01:53:28,202
Whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.

1374
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:58,332
I want to
tell you something, mark,

1375
01:53:58,365 --> 01:54:00,534
something you do not yet know,

1376
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:03,871
but we K-PAXians have been around
long enough to have discovered.

1377
01:54:05,372 --> 01:54:07,641
The universe will expand,

1378
01:54:07,674 --> 01:54:10,011
then it will collapse
back on itself,

1379
01:54:10,044 --> 01:54:12,479
and then it will expand again.

1380
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:15,917
It will repeat this
process forever.

1381
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:19,053
What you don't know is that when
the universe expands again,

1382
01:54:19,086 --> 01:54:22,356
everything will be as it is now.

1383
01:54:22,389 --> 01:54:24,358
Whatever mistakes you make
this time around, you will

1384
01:54:24,391 --> 01:54:26,427
live through on your next pass.

1385
01:54:26,460 --> 01:54:28,963
Every mistake you make...

1386
01:54:28,996 --> 01:54:30,965
You will live through...

1387
01:54:30,998 --> 01:54:35,236
Again and again, forever.

1388
01:54:35,269 --> 01:54:38,940
So my advice to you is to get
it right this time around,

1389
01:54:38,973 --> 01:54:41,508
because this time...

1390
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:43,978
Is all you have.

1391
01:54:54,588 --> 01:54:58,459
You're lookin' great, Michael.
Think so?

1392
01:54:58,492 --> 01:55:00,995
Thanks. How you doin'?

1393
01:55:01,028 --> 01:55:03,130
Good. How was your--
how was your trip?

1394
01:55:03,164 --> 01:55:05,199
Was it-- was it good?

1395
01:55:51,045 --> 01:55:54,448
* maybe this is forever

1396
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:56,650
* forever fades away

1397
01:55:58,219 --> 01:56:00,421
* like a rocket ascending

1398
01:56:00,454 --> 01:56:04,058
* into space

1399
01:56:05,492 --> 01:56:09,063
* could you not be sad

1400
01:56:09,096 --> 01:56:12,166
* could you not break down

1401
01:56:12,199 --> 01:56:14,601
* after all

1402
01:56:14,635 --> 01:56:17,371
* I won't let go

1403
01:56:17,404 --> 01:56:22,976
* until you're safe and sound *

1404
01:56:24,745 --> 01:56:30,051
* until you're safe and sound *

1405
01:56:31,685 --> 01:56:35,256
* there's beauty in release

1406
01:56:35,289 --> 01:56:38,625
* there's no one
left to please *

1407
01:56:38,659 --> 01:56:42,563
* but you and me

1408
01:56:55,609 --> 01:56:59,113
* I don't blame you
for quitting *

1409
