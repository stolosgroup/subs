00:01:00,585 --> 00:01:02,287
<i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

4
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,892
You gotta get these hinges
greased, Mick. Come on!

5
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:07,692
The grease
isn't the problem.

6
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,427
It's the hinge.

7
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:11,798
This is a creaky old dinosaur.

8
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,399
This old girl shoulda
been retired 10 years ago.

9
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,169
Yeah?

10
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:18,470
Yeah, well, they should have
retired me 10 years ago.

11
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,671
Not you, Charlie.

12
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,506
You're in your prime.

13
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:23,542
I should know
'cause we're the same age,

14
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:25,144
and I'm in my prime.

15
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:29,581
Hey,
is that coffee still hot?

16
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,449
Yeah, it's hot enough.

17
00:01:31,516 --> 00:01:33,585
All right, then.
Could you do me a favor?

18
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:39,457
You ever thought about, uh,
buying a coffeemaker?

19
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,093
Coffeemaker?

20
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,297
You know, one that's got
that milk froster thing?

21
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:46,098
Oh, yeah.
Frother. I got ya.

22
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:48,366
Yeah. That way,
then you can, uh...

23
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:49,802
Thanks.

24
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,503
You know,
make your own cappuccino.

25
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,206
Ugh, God damn!

26
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:55,540
Hey, I thought you said
this coffee was hot.

27
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:57,043
What is this?

28
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:59,212
Dude, it's typical.
What's our time?

29
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:00,913
I don't know,

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,414
but this truck needs
to get movin'.

31
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:04,382
The game's
gonna be startin' soon,

32
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,551

gonna be backed up.

33
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,087

- Dispatch, come in!
- What the fuck

- are we gonna do now?
- You know what to do.

37
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:15,393
- Follow protocol!
- Oh, shit.

38

- There's procedures for this!
- Let's go! Reverse! Reverse!

39

by armed assailants.

- <i>Can you hear me?</i>

They don't pay you
enough to act a fool, let's go!

00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:53,759
Fuck!

93
00:03:53,826 --> 00:03:55,394
Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

94
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,561
I said
the fucking legs.

95
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:58,331

<i>Exit west! We gotta go, Elvis!

00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:04,070

102
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:11,063
Our clients are made up of

103
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,832
large-scale
retail department stores,

104
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:14,567
marijuana dispensaries,
cash vaults,

105
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,402
casinos, private banks.

Could I get
another one? Thank you.

107
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:20,473
We're not federal.

108
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,341
We're essentially middlemen.

109
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,277
Hundreds of millions shifting
through here every week.

110
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,746
We got 12 trucks,
two or three guards in each.

111
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:29,949
A driver, a messenger,
and a guard,

112
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,152
each moving up to 15 mil
a day, and sometimes more,

113
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:35,754
which can attract
unwanted attention.

114
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,990
I won't lie.
It can be dangerous,

115
00:06:38,057 --> 00:06:39,657
which is why
we train you properly

116
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,626
and pay the premium rates,

117
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,596
so we can all
sleep better at night.

118
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,297
Thanks.

119
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,732
Now, your background checks
came back fine,

120
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,334
and your reference from

121
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,735
Orange Delta Security
was impressive.

122
00:06:49,802 --> 00:06:51,203
That was a good company.

123
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,472
I'm sorry to hear
it went bust.

124
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:54,840
Family?

125
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:56,742
Married. Divorced.

126
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,110
No one else?

127
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,979
No.

128
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:03,449
Good. Stay focused. I like it.

129
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:05,084
But just so you know,

130
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,853
we lost a couple of guards
a while back.

131
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,256
Killed on the job.
A civilian, too.

132
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,958
A fuckin' tragedy,

133
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,728
and they still haven't found
the scum who did it.

134
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,396
And that's why
we've upped our game.

135

137
00:07:22,635 --> 00:07:24,303
No, please. Don't get up.

138
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,670
Good to meet you.

139
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:28,174
Let's see. Hill... Hill...

140
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,744
H. I'm gonna call you H,
if that's okay?

141
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,046
They call me Bullet,
which is ironic

142
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:36,081
because I certainly
don't move like one.

143
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,416
You ready for target practice?

144
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,084
Ready.

145
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:41,086
I saw you had
your pistol license already.

146
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,856
So, this is the pre-assignment
training course.

147
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,424
We got eight hours together,

148
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:47,359
popping cans
off walls and the like.

149
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,929
You need to hit
the 70% pass mark.

150
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:51,931
There's some fitness
which, by the looks of it,

151
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:53,899
shouldn't be
a problem for you.

152
00:07:53,966 --> 00:07:55,734
We just need to see
how you are under pressure.

153
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,436
Shall we get started?

154
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:58,837
Whatever you say, Bullet.

155
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,858
Well, that's
quite enough of that.

156
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:34,740
Been a while, huh?

157
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,776
Little practice,
I'm sure you'll get there.

158
00:08:49,388 --> 00:08:51,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Too far! Too far!

159
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,026
Pull up a little. Pull it up.

160
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:02,167
Look at that.

161
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,637
70%.

162
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:06,071
Just slipped in.

163
00:09:06,138 --> 00:09:08,274
Any less,
we'd be doing this again.

164
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,043
You won't be joining
a Formula 1 team anytime soon,

165
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,512
but you'll do for this job.

166
00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:15,047
Let's get you suited.

167
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,449
<i>How many we got coming?</i>

168
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,120
In that case,
I'll get three pounds of ribs

169
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,388
and a bucket of wings
for the kids.

170
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:23,622
Cough up, Bullet.

171
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:24,758
Dude, I'm on the phone.

172
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:26,058
I don't care. $30.

173
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,459
- How much?
- 30 bucks.

174
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,560
Wait for it, wait for it.

175
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,229
- Change?
- Suplex!

176
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,964
- I want that money.
- There you go, buddy.

177
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,599
Give me that dollar dollar.

178
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,634
- Forty-one.
- Incoming. Thank you.

179
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,202
Forty-two's not gonna beat me.

180
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,204
- Fuck off, Dana.
- Come on.

181
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:41,607
You're not supposed to be
in here anyway.

182
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,242
No, I think it's you

183
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:45,110
who's in the wrong
changing room, Stuart.

184
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,812
Come on.
Let's look lively, people.

185
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,714
Chop-chop, Goose.
Show me your money.

186
00:09:49,114 --> 00:09:52,551
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a new addition.

187
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:53,686
Here you go, Shirley.

188
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:55,487
May I introduce H.

189
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,424
Oh, she'll do.

190
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,059
Put him down, Dana.

191
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,895
Come on.
I'll show you your locker.

192
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,530
This one's yours.

193
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,500
- You good?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,302
Why, don't I look it?

195
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:14,239
No, buddy, you look like
a shrink-wrapped Rolls-Royce,

196
00:10:14,306 --> 00:10:16,842
in contrast to this car crash.

197
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:20,179
Meet Hollow Bob
and Boy Sweat Dave.

198
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,081
You look like
you could do some pull-ups.

199
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:24,116
I'll put a 50
on you beatin' Boy Sweat here.

200
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,418
What's the matter with him?
He looks good for it.

201
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:27,920
Yeah, that's what
Boy Sweat thinks,

202
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:29,655
but he's also a cock.

203
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:30,824
Who's a cock?

204
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,624
You're a cock, Dave.

205
00:10:32,691 --> 00:10:34,593
I reckon our man here
could pull yours right off.

206
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,462
He looks like
he could handle a cock.

207
00:10:36,528 --> 00:10:38,097
Yeah, small hands.

208
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:40,566
Makes me very popular,
and you look good.

209
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,868
What's that?

210
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,272
I said, uh...

211
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:49,475
I'm sure you'd win.

212
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,677
At what?

213
00:10:51,745 --> 00:10:53,912
The pull-ups.

214
00:10:56,081 --> 00:10:58,150
Oh, charming.

215
00:10:58,217 --> 00:10:59,618
One of yours?

216
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,120
I've been lookin' for him.

217
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,521
I'll put him back
in the collection.

218
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:04,223
Glad I could help.

219
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,924
You know,
you're making friends already.

220
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,827
It's worth
getting to know Dave.

221
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,928
He's quite entertaining in
an unintentional kind of way.

222
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,563
Yeah.
He once killed a hamster

223
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,198
'cause he squeezed it
too tight.

224
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,834
And he can't write

225
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,335
without sticking
his tongue out.

226
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,337
This is
your temporary sidearm.

227
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:19,873
Just till you get your own.

228
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,306
I need you to love it,

229
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,041
respect it...

230
00:11:23,108 --> 00:11:24,643
...and bring it back
in one piece.

231
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,311
Do they want us back
in one piece, too?

232
00:11:26,678 --> 00:11:27,781
Do you have a problem?

233
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:29,982
I don't know. Do I?

234
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,583
What happens
if we're pullin' pistols

235
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,352
in a machine gun fight?

236
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,221
Then you retort with
a positive mental attitude.

237
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,957
- Name?
- He's H.

238
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,659
H?

239
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,930
Like the bomb,
or like Jesus H.

240
00:11:46,265 --> 00:11:48,600
Well, if you can mushroom
cloud or walk on water,

241
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,904
what you worried
about machine guns for?

242
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,241
It's the rock star's
first day.

243
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,577
All right, lucky you got
a soft drop, then.

244
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,312
Try to keep
your piece strapped,

245
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:01,915
like he shoulda done
on prom night.

246
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,715
You're just unhappy I'm happy.

247
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,317
Yeah, only man I know

248
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:06,952
that married
the first woman he banged.

249
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,587
You're a cynical old dog,
Supe.

250
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:10,890
But I still got
plenty of bitches.

251
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,090
'Course he does.

252
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,836
Well, that's nice.

253
00:12:22,902 --> 00:12:24,136
Who's your pal?

254
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,671
I'll explain later.

255
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:31,443
Jesus Christ, at least
try to look busy, Shirley.

256
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,178
What, you got another
hot date tonight, Dana?

257
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:35,514
You're gonna love
who your new partner is.

258
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,282
Just tell me
it ain't the Limey.

259
00:12:37,349 --> 00:12:38,984
The grand ol' duke himself.

260
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,285
Fuck!

261
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:43,155
Boy Sweat,
you'll be happy to hear

262
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,090
that H
is replacing Sticky John.

263
00:12:45,157 --> 00:12:47,025
- Thank you, Stuart.
- You got it, Bullet.

264
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,729
Stay out from under my feet,
and we'll get along just fine.

265
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,832
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this job can be?

266
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,032
Some idea, yeah.

267
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:56,235
No, you have no idea.

268
00:12:56,301 --> 00:12:59,705
We ain't the predators,
we're the prey.

269
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:04,510
Ooh.

270
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:06,913
Boy Sweat's up front.
You jump in there with him.

271
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,280
Whatever you say, boss.

272
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,124
Did you hear about
the guards that were murdered?

273
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:20,659
You know,
it happened right down there.

274
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:22,160
Come on, Dave,
it's his first day.

275
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,930
What? He needs to hear this.

276
00:13:23,997 --> 00:13:26,465
Don't engage. He'll forget
what he said in a moment.

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,634
I heard.

278
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,270
It's a tragedy.

279
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,873
Yeah, what you didn't hear

280
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,074
is that I was meant to be
driving the truck that day.

281
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:40,212
Why wasn't ya?

282
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,580
I was sick.

283
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:42,749
Hungover.

284
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:45,517
Sick. All holes.

285
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:47,519
And the last thing I needed
was the Feds in my face

286
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,822
trying to make out
if I was involved somehow.

287
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:51,791
Lucky you had a strong alibi.

288
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:54,027
Fuck you, Bullet.

289
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:55,627
He was staying at his mom's.

290
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:58,564
She knows how I like my eggs.

291
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:06,338
This is a $2 million
pickup for Bank of the US.

292
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:09,107
Dave will stay in the truck.
H, you're coming with me.

293
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:12,045
You get to meet the lovely
ladies who work the tills.

294
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,913
Just be wary of Hot Betty.

295
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,749
If you're lucky, she'll only
take your fuckin' arm off.

296
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,055
Godfrey, H.
H, Godfrey.

297
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,089
- H.
- Godfrey.

298
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,724
X marks the spot.

299
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,095
Godfrey, as always,
a pleasure.

300
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,365
I like the way
you handle that cart.

301
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:35,100
Where'd you learn
that technique?

302
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,904
Spent a lot of time
in supermarkets.

303
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:40,039
Shopping.

304
00:14:40,105 --> 00:14:41,741
I can picture it now.

305
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:45,611
A paragon of modern man
on a wild sojourn,

306
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:50,282
stalking down the aisles,
hunting for Pop-Tarts.

307
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:53,052
Pop-Tarts are not really
my poison, Bullet.

308
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:55,721
I prefer to lose myself
in the dizzy food coma

309
00:14:55,788 --> 00:14:59,324
of synthetic cheese
and impossible meats.

310
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,127
What has the world
come to?

311
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,429
A direct line of evolution,

312
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,565
from Paleolithic man

313
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:09,601
to a diabetic house husband.

314
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,038
Harsh.

315
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,505
But true.

316
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:19,378
How'd your boy do?

317
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:21,213
Did he survive
the hostile territory

318
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,181
of Hot Betty
and the menopausal MILFs?

319
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:26,085
Did you make poo-poo,
or is your diaper still clean?

320
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:27,519
He did just fine.

321
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:29,922
Hot Betty
almost slid off her seat.

322
00:15:29,989 --> 00:15:33,158
Oh, so there's juice
in the old raisin yet.

323
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:49,341
<i>Wakey-wakey, Sticky.</i>

324
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,246
<i>2411, clear to proceed.</i>

325
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,221
<i>Pull her in slowly this time,
Boy Sweat.</i>

326
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:11,296
<i>Base,
this is Gamma reporting back.</i>

327
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:13,398
Copy that, Gamma.

328
00:16:13,465 --> 00:16:15,200
Where's that boyfriend
of yours?

329
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:18,370
They always gotta see
the driver and messenger.

330
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,439
Otherwise,
you ain't gettin' in.

331
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:26,946
Okay, Gamma,
you're clear.

332
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:30,116
At least your boy
didn't fuck that up.

333
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:32,018
I still prefer Sticky John.

334
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:33,719
Everyone prefers Sticky John.

335
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,922
Mm, you're gonna
love him, Dave.

336
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:39,192
He's got that exotic European
thing workin' for him.

337
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:40,993
It'll take you a while
to dial in.

338
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,762
Hasn't taken me very long.

339
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,931
I don't care
what you guys think.

340
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,133
That man's a dark horse.

341
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,667
What do you mean by that?

342
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:50,335
That cat's overqualified
for this game.

343
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:52,071
He's got history.

344
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:55,208
We're all overqualified
for this game,

345
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:56,776
and we all got history.

346
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:00,245
Beer and pool?

347
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:02,849
Your first day's over.

348
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:04,449
It's a tradition.

349
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:07,352
Sure. Give me two minutes.

350
00:17:13,425 --> 00:17:15,660
Well, look who it is,
Beauty and the fucking Beast.

351
00:17:15,728 --> 00:17:18,030
Ain't you gonna
put your card back, Sticky?

352
00:17:39,952 --> 00:17:41,854
The point of the game is
to get the ball in the hole.

353
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:44,289
Point of a woman
is to shut the fuck up, Dana.

354
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,858
All that Ivy League education

355
00:17:45,925 --> 00:17:47,727
is really workin' for you,
Boy Sweat.

356
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,461
Pretty soon
you'll all be workin' for me.

357
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,863
The power's
in this big head here.

358
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:52,865
Well, it's definitely not
in your little head,

359
00:17:52,932 --> 00:17:54,599
or are you
still blaming the beer?

360
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:58,271
Yo, Jap's eye, you gonna
take a shot, or what?

361
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:01,073
At least I'll still be here
next week to take a shot.

362
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:03,075
What's that supposed
to fuckin' mean?

363
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:05,044
He's already got your old job.

364
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:08,413
Word around the pool table is
boss has eyes for the new boy.

365
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,449
What, flat-footed Limey?
I'd shit him.

366
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:13,219
Maybe you should
say that to his face.

367
00:18:13,286 --> 00:18:14,821
Maybe I will.

368
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,790
I spy with my little eye
that I smell fear.

369
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:19,826
That doesn't make any sense.

370
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:21,426
Hey, John.

371
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:23,729
You're an idiot.

372
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,866
Fuckin' assholes.

373
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,035
Here comes the walk of shame.

374
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,669
Yo, Action Man,

375
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:33,072
can I buy you a beer?

376
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:34,506
Nah.

377
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,011
Sorry, uh...

378
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:41,713
You mind?

379
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,923
So, uh, where'd
you work before, then?

380
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:55,694
Orange Delta Security, Europe.

381
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:58,496
Jolly excitin', was it, mate?

382
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,770
Yeah, spectacular.

383
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,507
You ain't much for talking,
are ya, Mary Poppins?

384
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:11,043
Oh, no, I can talk.

385
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,511
I just don't want
to talk to you.

386
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:15,281
Let me buy you a beer.

387
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,950
Just make sure
you drink it over there.

388
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:30,997
Anything else?

389
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:41,506
I gotta give it to ya, H.

390
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,910
You're a real social magician.

391
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:47,046
First, you take his job,

392
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:50,515
and then you make him cry
in his beer.

393
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,873
What is
taking him so long?

394
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,607
It's a 10-grand drop.

395
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,943
He should have been back
five minutes ago.

396
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:22,647
Hey, Bullet,
what's taking you so long?

397
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Bullet, unless you found

398
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:30,856
some beautiful,
blue-eyed Latino boy,

399
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,657
you should be back by now.

400
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:39,497
<i>Fuck, fuck!</i>

401
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:43,135
<i>You fucking look at me...</i>

402
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,669
<i>You see me,
and you fucking die!</i>

403
00:20:48,606 --> 00:20:50,843
<i>Dave...</i>

404
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,145
<i>Dave...</i>

405
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:54,947
<i>We're gonna
fucking kill him.</i>

406
00:20:58,351 --> 00:21:00,585
<i>Now, listen to me, ladies.</i>

407
00:21:00,652 --> 00:21:02,755
<i>If you wanna see
your girlfriend again,</i>

408
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,890
<i>you'll do exactly as I say.</i>

409
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:08,194
Uh...

410
00:21:09,295 --> 00:21:10,662
Um...

411
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,465
I have to call this...
No! Uh...

412
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,367
There's a protocol for this.
We have to drive away.

413
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:16,235
- We just drive away.
- Sorry?

414
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:18,838
They don't want his 10 grand.
They don't want his 10 grand.

415
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,873
The money's in the truck.
We have $2.5 million in here.

416
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,707
If we take it away,
they're not gonna hurt him.

417
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:23,641
They're not gonna kill him
for 10 grand.

418
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,277
Dave,

419
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:27,380
you need to
pull yourself together.

420
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,248
You need to reconsider this.

421
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:30,883
Reconsider?

422
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,251
That's why they have
the fucking policy!

423
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:33,718
You don't wanna do this,

424
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:34,987
you can get out
of the truck now.

425
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,622
But we're not
leaving him behind.

426
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:38,656
He's one of us.

427
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:40,259
It's only money.

428
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,294
In short,

429
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:44,529
I'm getting him back.

430
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,733
<i>Stop fucking around.</i>

431
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,037
<i>You have one minute
before she dies.</i>

432
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:54,672
<i>Now, turn the key and drive,</i>

433
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,910
<i>and I will tell you
when to stop.</i>

434
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,712
You gonna drive,
or you getting out?

435
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:02,647
Oh, shit.

436
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:05,583
This is such a bad idea.

437
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:20,966
<i>Take the next left.</i>

438
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,319
<i>Now, stop the truck.</i>

439
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,797
All right. All right.

440
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:53,999
Get the fuck
over here.

441
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,868
<i>We got
your fucking friend.</i>

442
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:57,602
<i>He don't mean shit to us.</i>

443
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:58,971
They're serious!

444
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,841
Shut the fuck up.

445
00:23:01,907 --> 00:23:04,210
<i>Open the fucking doors,</i>

446
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:07,480
<i>and pick up the money,
and throw it in the flatbed.</i>

447
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:09,381
You open it, they're just
gonna kill all three of us

448
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:11,317
and take the money anyway.

449
00:23:11,716 --> 00:23:13,352
Dave, you just worry about

450
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:14,887
putting your arsehole
back in your arsehole,

451
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:17,089
and leave this to me.

452
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:18,824
Fuck!

453
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,244
Fuck!

454
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,179
This guy's fucking
around. He's throwing

455
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:41,547
- <i>bags on the floor.</i>
- God fucking damn it.

456
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,282
Now, listen up, fuckboy.

457
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:44,984
I said throw the money
in the fucking flatbed.

458
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,852
Try to get clever again,

459
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,088
and old boy's getting
a face full of shit.

460
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:50,489
<i>Now, aim fucking straight!</i>

461
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:51,957
Just do what he says.

462
00:23:52,024 --> 00:23:53,792
These guys
are fucking serious.

463
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:00,633
Get it in the truck
next time, you fucknut!

464
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,368
Sorry, pal.

465
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,337
Oh, fuck!

466
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:10,543
Fuck!

467
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:11,877
Please!
Put the gun down!

468
00:24:11,944 --> 00:24:13,412
Just let them take the money!

469
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:14,513
You're gonna
get us fucking killed.

470
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:16,615
Fuck, go, move!

471
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:18,384
Please stop!

472
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,852
Just give 'em
the fucking money!

473
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,686
Are you fucking insane?

474
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:26,225
Fuck! Fuck!

475
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:42,441
Bullet! Bullet!

476
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:44,276
Who is this fucking lunatic?

477
00:25:05,864 --> 00:25:08,000
Ahh! Fuck!

478
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:11,870
Jesus Christ.

479
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:13,806
Who do you work for?

480
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:16,508
Suck my fucking dick!

481
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:18,210
What did you say?

482
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:21,814
I said suck my fucking dick!

483
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,315
Suck your own dick.

484
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:35,995
You all right, Dave?

485
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,765
Did you make poo-poo?

486
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:58,550
Thank you for that.

487
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,325
Last but not least, Mr. Hill.

488
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,661
Well, you're all
sticking to the same story.

489
00:26:08,728 --> 00:26:10,663
That's what happened.

490
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:12,998
What I don't understand

491
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,533
is how you managed
to take down six men

492
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,268
without even so much
as a scratch.

493
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:17,771
Well, you gotta admit
it's impressive.

494
00:26:17,836 --> 00:26:19,538
He saved his partner's life.

495
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,107
What about
your firearms experience?

496
00:26:22,174 --> 00:26:25,678
Your shooting was
unambiguously precise, yet

497
00:26:26,378 --> 00:26:29,348
your training scores
were decidedly average.

498
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,383
Barely even passed.

499
00:26:32,518 --> 00:26:34,987
Kill or be killed.

500
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,490
Seemed to focus the mind.

501
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,731
All right.
Well, there's something else.

502
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,200
We'd like you
to take a look at this video.

503
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:50,069
It's the security footage

504
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:52,104
from the raid on
the Fortico cash truck before.

505
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:53,872
When the guards were killed.

506
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:55,407
Uh, I can't watch this again.

507
00:26:55,474 --> 00:26:57,443
Step outside,
by all means.

508
00:26:58,977 --> 00:27:00,814
We just want
you to let us know

509
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:02,448
if you think
there's any connection

510
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:04,016
between this robbery

511
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,884
and the men
you encountered before.

512
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,630
You, uh... You all right
to keep watching?

513
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:22,634
Yeah. I'm all right.

514
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:28,907
Mr. Hill?

515
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:31,009
Anything ringing a bell?

516
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:36,515
Mr. Hill?

517
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:40,285
Could they be related
in any way?

518
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,423
Any connection, Mr. Hill?

519
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,024
No.

520
00:27:47,025 --> 00:27:48,293
You sure?

521
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:51,397
I'm sure.

522
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,567
All right, Mr. Hill,

523
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:57,269
we'll pick this up
another day.

524
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:01,640
Are we done?

525
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,008
Yeah, we'll be in touch.

526
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:06,945
Visit the therapist. Rest up.

527
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,082
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

528
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:17,222
Patrick, can I have a word?

529
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,793
We have a policy.

530
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:21,660
The shrinks advise

531
00:28:21,728 --> 00:28:23,929
that employees be taken off
the front line for a month

532
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,765
following violent incidents,

533
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:28,233
and longer if lives were lost.

534
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,103
So, we're gonna
transfer you to desk duty,

535
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,772
in case of PTSD.

536
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,072
Do I look disturbed?

537
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:35,775
No. No, you don't.

538
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:38,477
But then, these things
take time to manifest,

539
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,045
to percolate.

540
00:28:40,112 --> 00:28:41,980
It's with your best interests
at heart.

541
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,851
You hired me to do a job.
Did a job.

542
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,386
No, we hired you
to move money.

543
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,855
You hired me to protect money.

544
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,622
Mr. Hill.

545
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:54,460
Hey, I'm Blake Halls.
I own Fortico.

546
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:56,295
I wanted to congratulate you
for yesterday

547
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,063
and to thank you in person.

548
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,232
What you did deserves credit.

549
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:02,134
You're a real hero,

550
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,603
and that's not wasted on me.

551
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,505
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off

552
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:09,575
while Terry and I
discuss your promising future?

553
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:15,647
Terry, we need that guy
in the field.

554
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:18,417
If we'd had him last year,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

555
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:20,486
He's exactly what we need,

556
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:23,355
and the publicity for Fortico
has been very positive.

557
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:25,090
Plus, have you heard
the crews talking?

558
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:26,625
They're inspired.

559
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:29,228
So, don't punish him,
promote him.

560
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,066
<i>Well?</i>

561
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:35,634
Yes, it was him.

562
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:38,403
Oh, it had him
written all over it.

563
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,539
Question is,
what was he doing there?

564
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:43,308
I think we know
what he was doing there, boss.

565
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:45,812
Oh, clever fucking you,
Hubbard.

566
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,346
It's called sarcasm.

567
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,214
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

568
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,116
Not a fucking thing.
Let the painter paint.

569
00:29:51,183 --> 00:29:52,684
<i>Do you have any idea
what would happen to us</i>

570
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,319
if anyone found out

571
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:56,221
that we let the fox
in the fucking henhouse?

572
00:29:56,823 --> 00:29:59,591
The Bureau's been trying to
catch this man for 25 years.

573
00:29:59,658 --> 00:30:02,294
<i>We're just gonna let him
sit on hundreds of millions?</i>

574
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:04,129
Money doesn't mean
a thing to him.

575
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:05,765
Listen, there's a reason
why I chose you two.

576
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:08,367
Because we have
the same priorities.

577
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:11,303
<i>Now, listen to me
very carefully.</i>

578
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:13,773
As far as you're concerned,

579
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,274
he's just a regular guard
doing a good job.

580
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,475
Do we understand each other?

581
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,779
Loud and clear.

582
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,715
"Let the painter paint"?

583
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,819
What the fuck
does that look like?

584
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:44,636
Fortico personnel files,

585
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:47,306
pictures of Dana's family,

586
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,274
and

587
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:52,678
the autopsy report.

588
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:19,237
<i>You hear me?</i>

589
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:20,740
<i>Out of the fucking car!</i>

590
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:22,976
<i>Face down, motherfucker!
Come on!</i>

591
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:24,576
<i>Show me your fucking hands!</i>

592
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:26,278
<i>Face down
on the ground right now!</i>

593
00:31:29,048 --> 00:31:30,817
<i>What the fuck?</i>

594
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:32,684
<i>Face to
the fucking ground!</i>

595
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:44,831
Seems you can walk on water,
after all.

596
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,836
Keep up the good work,
soldier.

597
00:31:49,902 --> 00:31:51,303
Nice one, man.

598
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,273
Be my guest.

599
00:31:57,576 --> 00:31:58,778
All right, brother.

600
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,147
Yeah, man! Let's go!

601
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:06,518
Jump on up, big boy.

602
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:20,365
We should get takeout.
From the Blossom.

603
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,536
The noodle soup at Neptune's
is the bomb.

604
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:26,939
I prefer the Blossom.

605
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:28,440
All right.

606
00:32:28,707 --> 00:32:30,943
You gonna call the order in?

607
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:33,378
I'm busy.

608
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,380
I can see that.

609
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:37,016
Who's this joker?

610
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:38,951
What the hell's going on?

611
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,318
Move it!
Get the fuck back!

612
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:41,754
Get down!

613
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:44,589
Reverse! Reverse!

614
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:45,792
I can't fucking see!

615
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:53,298
Gamma to Base,
we have a Code Red.

616
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,201
<i>Gamma, this is Base.
What's your location? Over.</i>

617
00:32:56,268 --> 00:32:57,770
Port's covered!

618
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,304
Chinatown!
Broadway and Hill.

619
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,707
Repeat, Code Red in progress.

620
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:03,575
<i>All right, Gamma,
just follow procedure.</i>

621
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:05,343
<i>Stay in the truck. Over.</i>

622
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,013
Get out
of the fucking truck!

623
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,748
<i>Police have been
dispatched.</i>

624
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:10,482
Come on,
get out of there!

625
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:12,451
Get out
of the fucking truck!

626
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:14,386
<i>Gamma, come in.</i>

627
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:15,855
On the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!

628
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:16,889
Open the fucking doors!

629
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:18,991
<i>What's your status?
Over.</i>

630
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:19,992
Get down!

631
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:21,160
Get down!

632
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:25,932
Get down on the ground!

633
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,700
You got three seconds!

634
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,210
So... So...
So, let me get this straight,

635
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:38,778
they just walked away?

636
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:41,346
Get in
the fucking van! Move it!

637
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:42,849
Let's fucking go now!

638
00:33:42,915 --> 00:33:44,150
Get the fuck
out of here!

639
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:54,493
Doors were open.

640
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,929
What the fuck was it, Mike?

641
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:59,531
It was the...

642
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,533
Yeah.

643
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,369
Turned back around and left.

644
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,208
No, I'm sorry...

645
00:34:09,274 --> 00:34:12,044
But what Terry is trying to
say is that you're a legend.

646
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,612
And if you keep this up,

647
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,514
you won't just be
employee of the month,

648
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,984
you'll have your own calendar
and merchandise.

649
00:34:18,985 --> 00:34:21,353
Now, get out there
and keep crushing it.

650
00:34:27,026 --> 00:34:28,593
Why are you so cynical?

651
00:34:28,828 --> 00:34:31,396
I'm starting to think
he's a psychopath.

652
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:38,971
I hear H is for Hero.

653
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:41,841
Drink?

654
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,759
It doesn't feel right.

655
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:06,899
<i>It was as if he recognized H.</i>

656
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:12,772
<i>Like he saw a dark spirit.</i>

657
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,608
What are you saying?

658
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:20,980
<i>I don't know
what I'm saying.</i>

659
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:24,649
<i>He's not a cop.</i>

660
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:27,987
<i>Doesn't smell like a cop.</i>

661
00:35:29,322 --> 00:35:31,489
But if he's not a cop,
what is he?

662
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:35,393
He's a dark fucking spirit.

663
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:44,136
Put that on.

664
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:46,571
Meet me next door.

665
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:51,244
I told you that first day...

666
00:35:51,744 --> 00:35:53,445
I don't trust him.

667
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:02,355
What the hell are you doing?

668
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,223
Sit down.

669
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,958
I'm not fucking sitting down.
I wanna go back to bed.

670
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,794
Dana. Sit down.

671
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,620
You got 10 seconds
to explain this.

672
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:38,157
I'm not telling you anything.

673
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:40,059
Dana.

674
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:43,296
It's very important that
you take my inquiry seriously.

675
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:44,897
I take it very seriously

676
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:46,365
that you think
you can interrogate me

677
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:48,067
in my own fucking house.

678
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:54,073
Fuck.

679
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,841
Jesus Christ, okay,
it's my savings, all right?

680
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,343
The fuck has it
got to do with you?

681
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,045
Dana, you're not listening.

682
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:00,712
Fuck! Jeez, all right,
all right, all right!

683
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,081
Okay. Please stop.

684
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:13,092
Sit down.

685
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:19,098
I found it.

686
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,699
Okay? It had been
signed for one day

687
00:37:20,766 --> 00:37:22,667
by the staff at Grande Liquor,

688
00:37:22,735 --> 00:37:24,170
and they missed it.
It was in the trolley, so...

689
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:25,371
You stole it?

690
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:27,406
Yeah, I fucking stole it.

691
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:29,976
It's 125,000. It's...

692
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:32,345
It's my retirement fund.

693
00:37:33,045 --> 00:37:34,947
You working
with anyone on the inside?

694
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:37,950
I don't know what the fuck...

695
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,188
Think carefully before
you answer the question.

696
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:48,928
No.

697
00:37:55,368 --> 00:37:57,635
The retirement fund is yours.

698
00:37:59,105 --> 00:38:00,873
But if it comes to light
that you're not telling me

699
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,242
something
that I need to know,

700
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:07,046
I want you to understand

701
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:09,547
how resourceful
and serious I am.

702
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:13,219
On the table
is a picture of your parents.

703
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:15,187
Had it taken last week.

704
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,190
I got your contacts...

705
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:20,725
I know who you love...

706
00:38:22,395 --> 00:38:25,064
and I do bear a grudge.

707
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:27,632
We understand each other?

708
00:38:30,002 --> 00:38:31,303
Good.

709
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:41,180
They're saying
that climate change

710
00:38:41,247 --> 00:38:42,714
is a natural phenomenon,

711
00:38:42,782 --> 00:38:44,316
rather than
an artificial phenomenon.

712
00:38:44,383 --> 00:38:45,918
So how do you explain
global warming?

713
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,787
The ice caps melting?

714
00:38:47,853 --> 00:38:50,555
Well, what melts up there
reforms down there.

715
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:52,657
Do you know why they call
the Arctic the Arctic

716
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,559
and the Antarctic
the Antarctic?

717
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,228
No, Dougie, I don't.

718
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:58,264
That's why I pay for you
to go to good schools.

719
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,899
<i>"Arktos"</i> means
"bear" in Greek.

720
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,300
<i>"Ant"</i> means "without."

721
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:04,336
Hence, <i>ant arktos,</i>

722
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:06,472
"without bears."

723
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,741
Up with, down without.

724
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:12,677
Good news for ice cubes,
bad news for polar bears.

725
00:39:12,745 --> 00:39:13,879
What time does the game start?

726
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,282
6:30. We've got ages.

727
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:17,817
What do you wanna do?

728
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:19,418
I don't know, grab some food?

729
00:39:21,087 --> 00:39:22,188
Sure.

730
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:24,824
Hello? What is it, Mike?

731
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,892
<i>We've got a problem
with the job.</i>

732
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:29,095
<i>We're gonna need you
to put eyes on the truck.</i>

733
00:39:32,565 --> 00:39:34,200
Dougie, go get a coat,
will ya?

734
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,268
It's not gonna rain.

735
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:38,437
Dougie, coat.

736
00:39:38,504 --> 00:39:40,005
But why?

737
00:39:40,072 --> 00:39:43,142
'Cause I'm your dad,
and I said so.

738
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:47,880
Get someone else to do it.

739
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:49,614
I can't, boss.
There is no one else.

740
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:50,816
It's gotta be you.

741
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:52,650
Joe, two fuckin' minutes!

742
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,220
<i>I'm with my son, Mike.</i>

743
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:55,988
You know Dougie's
over here on holiday,

744
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:57,689
and it's the only time
I get to see him.

745
00:39:57,756 --> 00:40:00,059
It's your fuckin' job.
You do it.

746
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,161
<i>Understood.</i>

747
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:05,531
Brendan was on it, but he got
knocked off his bike

748
00:40:05,598 --> 00:40:07,133
by a drunk driver.

749
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,701
Make sure the boss knows
it's not my fault.

750
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:11,537
It's a drunk driver.

751
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:13,339
Now, he's with the police
right now, making a statement.

752
00:40:13,405 --> 00:40:14,740
Otherwise,
he'd find a way to be there.

753
00:40:14,807 --> 00:40:15,808
There is no one else.

754
00:40:16,008 --> 00:40:17,510
<i>I'm out of town,</i>

755
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:19,578
<i>Moggy's surveying the depot.</i>

756
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:21,747
I'd help if I could, Mike.

757
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:23,648
But my eyeballs
are on the depot.

758
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,284
Then postpone it.

759
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:27,386
<i>Oh, we can do that
if you want,</i>

760
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:29,588
<i>but it's gonna set us back
three months of recon.</i>

761
00:40:29,654 --> 00:40:31,423
<i>We need to know the route.
If they turn left or right.</i>

762
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,292
<i>That's all
you have to witness.</i>

763
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,994
Yeah, and there's no danger
to it at all.

764
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,129
You can stand back
a thousand yards.

765
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:39,398
Didn't you put trackers
on the truck?

766
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:41,333
<i>They scan the trucks</i>

767
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,868
<i>every time
they return to the base.</i>

768
00:40:42,935 --> 00:40:44,270
<i>We can't do it digitally.</i>

769
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:46,238
<i>We gotta put eyes on it. And,</i>

770
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:48,240
boss?

771
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:50,342
Tracking you on your phone
right now.

772
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,478
You're blocks away.
Ten minutes.

773
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:55,247
<i>And I repeat, no danger.</i>

774
00:40:56,882 --> 00:40:58,184
Dad?

775
00:40:59,018 --> 00:41:01,153
- Happy?
- Happy.

776
00:41:11,696 --> 00:41:14,099
I'm starving. Fancy a burrito?

777
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,402
You don't even like burritos.

778
00:41:16,468 --> 00:41:18,137
I know, but I'm starving.

779
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:20,172
Sure.

780
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:27,213
I'll be two minutes, okay?

781
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:30,349
Keep the doors locked.
Don't go anywhere.

782
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,450
All right.

783
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:44,597
Yes, sir?

784
00:41:44,663 --> 00:41:45,664
Two burritos, please, sir.

785
00:41:45,731 --> 00:41:46,765
You got it.

786
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:48,200
Go ahead, Mike.

787
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,169
<i>I can see you there.</i>

788
00:41:50,236 --> 00:41:54,440
<i>Now, is there some gates
on your left-hand side?</i>

789
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:57,710
Yeah.

790
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,211
<i>Now, in a minute,</i>

791
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:01,280
<i>those said gates
are gonna open,</i>

792
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:04,350
<i>and that said minute is now.</i>

793
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:11,323
<i>All I need to know from you</i>

794
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:14,393
<i>is if that truck
is turning left or right.</i>

795
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,133
Latter.

796
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,239
You know,
make your own cappuccino.

797
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:29,441
Ugh, God damn!

798
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:30,976
What is this?

799
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,597
Yo, out of
the fuckin' car! Come on!

800
00:42:51,664 --> 00:42:54,199
Don't fuckin' look at me!
Out of the fuckin' car!

801
00:42:57,102 --> 00:42:58,637
All right, Mike.

802
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:00,506
That's my day done.

803
00:43:00,572 --> 00:43:02,408
<i>Your call
has been forwarded to...</i>

804
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:03,976
You hear me?
Out of the fuckin' car!

805
00:43:04,043 --> 00:43:05,644
Face down, motherfucker!
Come on!

806
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,346
Show me your fuckin' hands!

807
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,882
Face down on the ground
right now!

808
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,583
There you go.

809
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,319
Do what we say,
and you fucking live.

810
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:14,853
Face to
the fucking ground!

811
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:17,523
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

812
00:43:21,894 --> 00:43:23,162
Two minutes!

813
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:31,470
Fuck!

814
00:43:32,806 --> 00:43:34,406
Number one,
are we good?

815
00:43:34,473 --> 00:43:36,475
- Are we good, number one?
- We're good.

816
00:43:36,608 --> 00:43:38,210
Dougie?

817
00:45:14,139 --> 00:45:17,109
Try not to, uh,
move too quickly.

818
00:45:17,176 --> 00:45:18,977
You're in a hospital.

819
00:45:19,211 --> 00:45:22,114
You were in an accident,
you were shot at.

820
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:24,716
Six bullets removed,

821
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:27,252
<i>and three operations.</i>

822
00:45:27,553 --> 00:45:29,354
Two life-saving.

823
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:31,423
You lost
a fifth of your blood.

824
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:35,994
You've... You've got
a warrior's spirit, Mr. Mace.

825
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:39,264
What about my son?

826
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:43,602
Dougie.

827
00:45:57,851 --> 00:45:59,651
<i>My beautiful boy.</i>

828
00:46:05,324 --> 00:46:07,326
<i>And now, he's gone.</i>

829
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,999
He looked up to you.

830
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:22,407
He was obsessed with you.

831
00:46:27,747 --> 00:46:29,615
It wasn't my work, Jane.

832
00:46:34,888 --> 00:46:37,322
You killed our son.

833
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,772
And still,
you have nothing to say.

834
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,584
You are a cold, cold cunt.

835
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:43,455
<i>My condolences
for your loss.</i>

836
00:47:47,626 --> 00:47:50,897
<i>Before you ask, we have
no leads on this thing.</i>

837
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:54,666
<i>Which is kinda strange
for a job this big.</i>

838
00:47:57,402 --> 00:47:59,171
Somebody knows something.

839
00:47:59,237 --> 00:48:00,940
Somebody always
knows something.

840
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,675
It's just I'm not allowed
to ask the hard questions.

841
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,852
Here's the shit list.

842
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:15,287
Knock yourself out.

843
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:25,098
Need any of them to live?

844
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:29,301
I don't miss anyone that
your boys have buried so far.

845
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:34,506
Then you're gonna
let me do this my way.

846
00:48:38,243 --> 00:48:40,512
I can do in two weeks

847
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:43,415
what you only wish
you could do in 20 years.

848
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:46,518
If their names
are on that list,

849
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:48,387
you can do your worst.

850
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:51,858
Just be mindful

851
00:48:51,924 --> 00:48:54,159
that I can only look confused
for so long.

852
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,796
The floor is yours.

853
00:49:13,813 --> 00:49:15,313
Brendan.

854
00:49:16,883 --> 00:49:18,450
You need to quit that.

855
00:49:18,517 --> 00:49:20,787
I can hardly breathe here.

856
00:49:21,453 --> 00:49:23,422
It wasn't your fault.

857
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:25,825
It was a drunk driver.

858
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:29,227
That's easy for you to say.

859
00:49:29,294 --> 00:49:31,530
It's his son, Moggy.
His only son.

860
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:33,699
Hey, we all fucked up.

861
00:49:33,766 --> 00:49:35,667
So, let's accept
responsibility

862
00:49:35,735 --> 00:49:37,904
and not turn on each other
in there.

863
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,741
Brendan, retain your dignity.

864
00:49:49,414 --> 00:49:51,583
It's a fuckin' tragedy,
boss.

865
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:55,054
We all loved Dougie
and our sympathies run deep.

866
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,023
It's more my fault
than anyone's,

867
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,759
and we'll do anything
to find who's responsible.

868
00:50:02,962 --> 00:50:05,464
I need to know
who pulled the trigger.

869
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:10,136
I need a face.

870
00:50:10,203 --> 00:50:11,603
Of course.

871
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:13,873
And we've been
on nothing else,

872
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,208
trying to get answers.

873
00:50:15,574 --> 00:50:17,676
It's not any
of the usual suspects.

874
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:23,783
You're gonna tell us
what we wanna know.

875
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:27,987
This is your last chance.

876
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:30,923
The tree has been shook.

877
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,592
<i>And it's been shook hard.</i>

878
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:38,865
I want a name.

879
00:50:39,598 --> 00:50:43,035
Anyone with the skillset
or the form.

880
00:50:43,635 --> 00:50:45,704
We've run out of names.

881
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:48,941
We've deployed large amounts
of time, money, and effort...

882
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:52,011
<i>...in the search for justice.</i>

883
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:55,480
<i>It was a long list.</i>

884
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:57,250
Not good enough.

885
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,185
Understood,

886
00:50:59,484 --> 00:51:01,653
but we've scorched the earth.

887
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:04,589
No, it's not understood.

888
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:09,095
You started by saying
you'd do anything,

889
00:51:09,162 --> 00:51:11,296
but what I'm hearing is

890
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:13,698
you think
you've done everything.

891
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,143
Understood.

892
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:26,813
<i>I hear the train a-comin'</i>

893
00:51:28,513 --> 00:51:31,050
<i>It's rollin' 'round the bend</i>

894
00:51:32,852 --> 00:51:35,720
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine</i>

895
00:51:37,256 --> 00:51:40,026
<i>Since I don't know when</i>

896
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,362
<i>I'm stuck in Folsom Prison</i>

897
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:47,632
<i>And time keeps draggin' on</i>

898
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:53,005
<i>But that train keeps a-rollin'</i>

899
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:58,543
<i>On down to San Antone</i>

900
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:02,915
<i>On down to San Antone</i>

901
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:08,553
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

902
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:12,058
<i>My mama told me, "Son..."</i>

903
00:52:12,124 --> 00:52:13,558
The fuck?

904
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,961
Make a sound
and you're dead.

905
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,929
- <i>"Always be a good boy"</i>
- What the fuck?

906
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:19,664
Get off me!

907
00:52:19,732 --> 00:52:21,868
<i>"Don't ever play with guns"</i>

908
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,172
All right, Jerome,
what do you think?

909
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,540
It's getting late.
We all got places to go.

910
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:29,976
So, why don't you
save us a lot of time

911
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:31,509
and you a lot of trouble

912
00:52:31,576 --> 00:52:32,644
and tell us
what we need to know?

913
00:52:32,912 --> 00:52:34,646
Trouble?

914
00:52:34,713 --> 00:52:37,250
You motherfuckers got no idea
how much trouble you in.

915
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:38,751
Do you know who the fuck I am?

916
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:40,319
Yeah, I know
exactly who you are,

917
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:41,988
and that's why you're here.

918
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:43,322
So, I can see
it's gonna be a long night.

919
00:52:43,388 --> 00:52:44,623
Let's get started.

920
00:52:44,824 --> 00:52:45,925
Bag him.

921
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:47,827
You motherfuckers!

922
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:49,494
<i>I hear the train a-comin'</i>

923
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:50,662
Get the fuck off me!

924
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,664
Fuck you!

925
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,901
<i>It's rollin' 'round the bend</i>

926
00:52:56,802 --> 00:52:59,739
<i>And I ain't seen the sunshine</i>

927
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:04,076
<i>Since I don't know when</i>

928
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:08,114
<i>When I was just a baby</i>

929
00:53:10,149 --> 00:53:12,785
<i>My mama told me, "Son...</i>

<i>"Don't ever play with guns"</i>

932
00:53:26,766 --> 00:53:29,001
All right, take it off.

933
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:46,152
I don't think
he knows anything.

934
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:52,925
We'll see about that.

935
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:02,701
I hear you're a tough lad
and a hard worker.

936
00:54:03,568 --> 00:54:05,171
Good for you.

937
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:08,673
But you're still
gonna give me a name.

938
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,511
If not for your life,
for hers.

939
00:54:16,415 --> 00:54:17,950
What the fuck?

940
00:54:18,017 --> 00:54:19,785
Don't touch her!
I said don't touch her!

941
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:21,586
Don't fucking touch her!

942
00:54:21,653 --> 00:54:22,922
- Leave her out of this!
- Bag her.

943
00:54:25,391 --> 00:54:26,459
All right.

944
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:29,694
The only fuckin' name.

945
00:54:37,336 --> 00:54:38,670
The Gashi brothers.

946
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,054
If it's anyone, it's them.

947
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,689
Fucking dark.

948
00:54:57,757 --> 00:55:02,395
Porn, trafficking,
witchcraft, kids,

949
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:04,230
home invasions.

950
00:55:04,296 --> 00:55:07,099
It's talked about
there's cash trucks, too.

951
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,268
But you did not
hear this from me,

952
00:55:09,335 --> 00:55:10,668
and if you did,

953
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:12,738
kill me now.

954
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,883
Give him 200 grand.

955
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:25,951
Put the keys in the car.

956
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:44,070
Pass me the water.

957
00:55:45,905 --> 00:55:47,940
You all right?

958
00:55:49,707 --> 00:55:51,243
No, I'm not.

959
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:54,313
It's a shitshow.

960
00:55:55,548 --> 00:55:57,349
Fucking reptiles.

961
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:02,855
There's kids involved.

962
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,726
Got a feeling I'm gonna
be cleaning up all day.

963
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:23,008
Mike!

964
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,796
Here you go, sweetheart.

965
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:19,632
Drink some water.

966
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:22,101
There's a good girl.

967
00:57:53,532 --> 00:57:55,434
How much is in the pot?

968
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:58,837
I'd say 2.5.

969
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:01,941
So, what do you think?

970
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:04,877
I think

971
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:07,246
it isn't them.

972
00:58:10,516 --> 00:58:12,818
You gotta tell the boss.

973
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:24,263
They're filthy fucks.

974
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:27,499
And they have done trucks,
but they ain't our men.

975
00:58:27,566 --> 00:58:29,768
That job was above them.

976
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:32,538
They're more
about the smash-and-grab.

977
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:34,039
Looks like
there's two and a half mil,

978
00:58:34,106 --> 00:58:35,374
which they confessed to,

979
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:36,775
but, uh,

980
00:58:37,676 --> 00:58:39,445
what do you want me to do?

981
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:45,985
Don't want you
to do anything, Moggy.

982
00:59:02,736 --> 00:59:04,603
How old are these girls?

983
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:08,007
Not old enough.

984
00:59:17,716 --> 00:59:19,551
Give the girls the cash.

985
00:59:19,952 --> 00:59:21,387
Let 'em go.

986
00:59:51,684 --> 00:59:54,219
Can I speak candidly, boss?

987
00:59:58,424 --> 01:00:00,893
I don't think
we should do this again.

988
01:00:02,995 --> 01:00:05,197
Understandably, you're...

989
01:00:06,165 --> 01:00:08,934
You're not in your right mind
just now and

990
01:00:10,035 --> 01:00:11,870
you need a break.

991
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:15,908
But we can't continue

992
01:00:15,974 --> 01:00:17,443
to handle business this way,
otherwise

993
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:21,313
some fucker's gonna come for
us before we can get to them.

994
01:00:24,316 --> 01:00:25,417
In truth,

995
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:27,186
we need a different approach.

996
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:32,958
It's gotta be an inside job.

997
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:36,495
You're right, Mike.

998
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,399
I shouldn't have
got you involved.

999
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:47,206
I'm gonna go back
to London for a while.

1000
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:52,611
Patrick.

1001
01:00:52,812 --> 01:00:55,714
Patrick?
I'm a Brit, not a Mick.

1002
01:00:55,782 --> 01:00:57,549
So, your mom's Irish.

1003
01:00:57,616 --> 01:00:59,218
Usual affair.

1004
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:01,153
This time, you're
Patrick Hill from Lewisham.

1005
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:03,188
You've got a driver's license,
passport,

1006
01:01:03,255 --> 01:01:05,624
IRS papers
with a full tax history,

1007
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:07,092
and medical records.

1008
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,161
All your criminal checks
are clean.

1009
01:01:09,228 --> 01:01:12,364
You've got 25 years' worth
of employment,

1010
01:01:12,431 --> 01:01:14,199
with references
working in Europe

1011
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:16,602
and the same for
the previous addresses, too.

1012
01:01:16,668 --> 01:01:18,637
Your employment history
has been inserted

1013
01:01:18,704 --> 01:01:22,141
into the Delta Orange
Security system.

1014
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:24,309
So, should anyone check,

1015
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:27,379
you've worked there
for 11 years.

1016
01:01:27,446 --> 01:01:29,348
You even finished college,

1017
01:01:29,415 --> 01:01:33,485
and have held the same
gym membership since 2011.

1018
01:01:33,552 --> 01:01:37,322
As requested,
you have your pistol license,

1019
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:41,160
and finally,
the hotel has been arranged.

1020
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,029
It's another brand-new you.

1021
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:46,365
Kirsty, one more thing.

1022
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:49,334
Get me a copy
of the coroner's report.

1023
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:54,440
You sure that's a good idea?

1024
01:01:54,506 --> 01:01:55,541
Just do it.

1025
01:01:56,074 --> 01:01:57,676
<i>And your reference from</i>

1026
01:01:57,744 --> 01:01:59,445
<i>Orange Delta Security
was impressive.</i>

1027
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:00,679
<i>Family?</i>

1028
01:02:00,747 --> 01:02:02,147
<i>Married. Divorced.</i>

1029
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:04,183
Anyone else?

1030
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,218
No.

1031
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,387
<i>It's a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Hill.</i>

1032
01:02:12,491 --> 01:02:14,726
You ain't much for talking,
are ya, Mary Poppins?

1033
01:02:14,794 --> 01:02:16,595
Let me buy you a beer.

1034
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:19,331
Just make sure
you drink it over there.

1035
01:02:27,506 --> 01:02:29,374
<i>The autopsy report.</i>

1036
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:31,176
<i>Show me your fucking hands!</i>

1037
01:02:31,243 --> 01:02:33,445
<i>Face down on the ground
right now!</i>

1038
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,114
<i>Face to the fucking ground!</i>

1039
01:02:36,181 --> 01:02:37,282
<i>Please.</i>

1040
01:02:43,322 --> 01:02:45,491
<i>How are you
holdin' up, Sam?</i>

1041
01:02:45,657 --> 01:02:47,359
What's to say?

1042
01:02:47,426 --> 01:02:51,129
I wake up late, watch TV,

1043
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:53,599
drink a beer
and watch more TV.

1044
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:55,467
Maybe convince Ma
to give me a few bucks,

1045
01:02:55,534 --> 01:02:57,636
so I can buy more beer and

1046
01:02:57,703 --> 01:03:01,006
watch TV until I'm drunk
enough to fall asleep.

1047
01:03:01,941 --> 01:03:04,109
Did I mention I watch TV?

1048
01:03:05,677 --> 01:03:08,080
You're awfully quiet,
Brad.

1049
01:03:08,146 --> 01:03:10,282
I'm not quiet.

1050
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:11,918
I'm bored.

1051
01:03:11,985 --> 01:03:13,085
Bored of what?

1052
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,254
Not fuckin' working.

1053
01:03:15,822 --> 01:03:20,259
We're built for combat,
not daytime TV.

1054
01:03:21,928 --> 01:03:25,464
The Afghanis treated us better
than our own.

1055
01:03:26,398 --> 01:03:28,801
I wish I was back in the unit.

1056
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,304
Boredom's more dangerous
than bullets.

1057
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:36,642
Give me an enemy
I can fuckin' see.

1058
01:03:40,579 --> 01:03:42,648
How about you?
You workin' yet, boss?

1059
01:03:43,248 --> 01:03:45,083
Still part-time at the mall.

1060
01:03:45,584 --> 01:03:47,152
Costin' more than I'm making.

1061
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,388
If it wasn't
for Amy's parents,

1062
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:51,256
we'd be on the street.

1063
01:03:51,323 --> 01:03:52,926
Yeah, it seems like
Carlos is the only one

1064
01:03:52,992 --> 01:03:55,028
who landed on his feet
with the oil tycoon.

1065
01:03:55,093 --> 01:03:58,096
So, I'm there from 6:00 in
the mornin' to 12:00 at night.

1066
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,566
This motherfucker's
drippin' in gold,

1067
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:02,601
and I haven't seen
a dollar in overtime yet.

1068
01:04:02,668 --> 01:04:04,369
One minute,
we're killin' Arabs,

1069
01:04:04,436 --> 01:04:05,671
the next minute,
we're wiping their ass.

1070
01:04:05,872 --> 01:04:07,506
Afghanis aren't Arabs.

1071
01:04:07,573 --> 01:04:10,409
They're not? What are they?

1072
01:04:10,743 --> 01:04:11,878
Clue's in the name.

1073
01:04:11,945 --> 01:04:13,512
Afghanis.

1074
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:16,749
Whatever,
they're not Americans.

1075
01:04:16,816 --> 01:04:18,584
Know what I wanna do?

1076
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:20,787
I wanna lift one of
those precious ornaments

1077
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:23,388
until I get
my motherfuckin' overtime pay.

1078
01:04:23,455 --> 01:04:25,090
And why don't you?

1079
01:04:26,091 --> 01:04:28,093
Why don't I what?

1080
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:31,864
Make them pay.

1081
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:37,202
They owe us.

1082
01:04:39,038 --> 01:04:41,139
Why you askin' me?

1083
01:04:41,741 --> 01:04:42,775
Ask Sarge.

1084
01:04:51,483 --> 01:04:53,552
Do they keep cash?

1085
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:05,865
What's that?

1086
01:05:09,936 --> 01:05:11,804
<i>That is it.</i>

1087
01:05:13,106 --> 01:05:14,539
That's fuckin' what?

1088
01:05:15,273 --> 01:05:16,943
<i>That is what is left</i>

1089
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:18,878
<i>after we washed it
through the system.</i>

1090
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:20,880
What's on the table?

1091
01:05:21,014 --> 01:05:22,714
<i>110.</i>

1092
01:05:23,016 --> 01:05:25,617
<i>Two Rolexes, a Patek,</i>

1093
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:28,788
<i>6-carat ring, chains,
40 grand cash.</i>

1094
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:30,622
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

1095
01:05:30,689 --> 01:05:31,991
<i>I got hit over the head
and lost my job</i>

1096
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,960
for, like, 18 Gs apiece?

1097
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:36,963
<i>I thought we worked out
over half a million in solids.</i>

1098
01:05:37,262 --> 01:05:40,532
We did the legwork,
we made the calls.

1099
01:05:40,599 --> 01:05:41,968
- Number one.
- <i>Go ahead, four.</i>

1100
01:05:42,035 --> 01:05:43,468
Incoming.

1101
01:05:43,669 --> 01:05:46,906
We spent the sweat,
we dealt with the fence.

1102
01:05:48,206 --> 01:05:49,641
<i>That's what we get.</i>

1103
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:51,710
<i>Salaam alaikum.</i>

1104
01:05:53,378 --> 01:05:54,713
Even split.

1105
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,318
We're not the Mafia.
We're soldiers.

1106
01:06:00,686 --> 01:06:02,889
Nah, somethin'
ain't right here.

1107
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:05,758
You trying to say
something, Jan?

1108
01:06:05,825 --> 01:06:06,959
Fuck off, Jan.

1109
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:10,228
Go find another bone to chew.

1110
01:06:10,295 --> 01:06:11,764
You'll break your teeth
on this one.

1111
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:14,266
And stand up
when the boss is talkin'.

1112
01:06:22,474 --> 01:06:24,443
We could change it,
though.

1113
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:25,778
Cut out the middleman.

1114
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:27,847
What does that mean?

1115
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:31,550
<i>We want cash.</i>

1116
01:06:33,052 --> 01:06:34,519
<i>We go after cash.</i>

1117
01:06:34,686 --> 01:06:36,856
We got a guy on the inside.

1118
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:38,557
Inside of what?

1119
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:41,693
Cash trucks.

1120
01:06:45,664 --> 01:06:49,701
We took in 1.18 million.

1121
01:06:51,938 --> 01:06:53,705
<i>That's three years'</i>

1122
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:55,108
<i>worth of work
in one day, baby!</i>

1123
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:58,978
That's $168,571 each.

1124
01:06:59,045 --> 01:07:00,880
<i>That's a lot of paper
right there.</i>

1125
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:02,581
<i>Hold on...
Hold on a second,</i>

1126
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:05,283
<i>that's split seven ways,
not six?</i>

1127
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,618
Thirty seconds.

1128
01:07:06,786 --> 01:07:08,420
There might not be
a middleman,

1129
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:09,488
but there is a man
on the inside.

1130
01:07:09,554 --> 01:07:10,689
He needs a slice.

1131
01:07:16,461 --> 01:07:18,597
And who is this inside man?

1132
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,100
You don't need to know.

1133
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:24,503
Uh-uh-uh. Yes,
motherfuckers, these are guns,

1134
01:07:24,569 --> 01:07:26,205
and we will not hesitate
to kill you.

1135
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:27,874
Hands behind your back.

1136
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,708
Don't be a hero.
It's not your money.

1137
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,409
Show me your
fuckin' hands, white boy.

1138
01:07:31,476 --> 01:07:32,879
Put your hand
behind your back.

1139
01:07:32,945 --> 01:07:34,546
What's your driver's name?

1140
01:07:34,713 --> 01:07:36,381
If you lie to me,
I'll fuckin' kill you.

1141
01:07:36,448 --> 01:07:37,383
- Chad.
- Chad fucking what?

1142
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:38,617
Chad Reed.

1143
01:07:38,683 --> 01:07:40,452
Horrible name.

1144
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:41,921
Gentlemen,
we have found our opportunity

1145
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:43,256
to stand tall again

1146
01:07:43,823 --> 01:07:47,392
<i>after years taking it
staring at our laces.</i>

1147
01:07:48,094 --> 01:07:50,595
<i>Don't quit
your day job just yet.</i>

1148
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:52,932
<i>Rhythm as normal. Be smart.</i>

1149
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:55,067
Don't go buying
anything flashy.

1150
01:07:55,134 --> 01:07:57,904
Just what you absolutely need.
Do you hear me, Jan?

1151
01:07:59,005 --> 01:08:01,306
Oh, yeah.
Loud and clear, boss.

1152
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:05,745
<i>Groceries, good.
Sports cars, bad.</i>

1153
01:08:06,678 --> 01:08:08,480
<i>This isn't
retirement money.</i>

1154
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,082
<i>But we play it right,
it could be.</i>

1155
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:12,684
Yo, Dave, come in.

1156
01:08:15,988 --> 01:08:17,622
Come in, Dave.

1157
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:19,292
Just checkin'
everything's as it should be.

1158
01:08:19,826 --> 01:08:21,928
<i>All good here, Chad.</i>

1159
01:08:21,994 --> 01:08:23,896
Be out in two.

1160
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:27,632
Did that just go as smooth
as I thought it did?

1161
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:29,634
Yeah, don't count
your chickens just yet.

1162
01:08:33,005 --> 01:08:34,106
Hold up.

1163
01:08:34,506 --> 01:08:36,008
Gentlemen.

1164
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:37,576
If I could just
get your signatures.

1165
01:08:37,642 --> 01:08:39,711
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

1166
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:43,448
- Fantastic.
- Thank you.

1167
01:08:44,683 --> 01:08:46,685
<i>I'm telling you now,</i>

1168
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:48,921
<i>there's more gold
in these hills.</i>

1169
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:51,924
<i>Yeah. And we haven't even
tapped into our skillset.</i>

1170
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:53,926
<i>Monkeys could've
done that job.</i>

1171
01:08:53,993 --> 01:08:55,294
So, let's push
ourselves, then.

1172
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,528
Easy, boys.

1173
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:58,197
Walking before running.

1174
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:00,632
Yeah, I don't know
about you guys,

1175
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:02,034
but I feel like
I've been walkin'

1176
01:09:02,101 --> 01:09:03,668
for a long fuckin' time.

1177
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:08,506
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1178
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:13,411
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1179
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:17,616
<i>Happy birthday, dear Jack</i>

1180
01:09:17,682 --> 01:09:19,785
Happy birthday, Daddy!

1181
01:09:19,852 --> 01:09:25,124
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1182
01:09:25,758 --> 01:09:28,094
Yeah!

1183
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:30,562
Oh...

1184
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:31,663
It's gettin'
harder and harder.

1185
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,635
<i>I know it is my birthday,</i>

1186
01:09:36,701 --> 01:09:39,972
<i>but I've got
a present for you.</i>

1187
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:42,742
What are you sittin' on,
old man?

1188
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:47,013
More work,
but with a significant bump.

1189
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:48,480
It's another truck.

1190
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:51,250
This time, there's gonna be
at least 6 mil inside.

1191
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:53,518
Now, we're talkin'.

1192
01:09:53,585 --> 01:09:56,255
<i>Well, it's a lot more
profitable than killin' Arabs,</i>

1193
01:09:56,322 --> 01:09:58,157
and it makes my blood flow.

1194
01:10:01,894 --> 01:10:03,662
Sweetheart,
what about the kids?

1195
01:10:03,728 --> 01:10:05,164
Yeah, feed them first.

1196
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:06,564
Bad animals, bad.

1197
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:09,701
Sorry, Mrs. Ainsley.

1198
01:10:09,769 --> 01:10:11,503
Here, let me help you with...
help you with that.

1199
01:10:12,504 --> 01:10:14,140
<i>Is the intel good?</i>

1200
01:10:15,374 --> 01:10:16,976
We got a good inside man.

1201
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:18,610
<i>He's one of us.</i>

1202
01:10:18,677 --> 01:10:20,046
<i>Served under me
back in the day.</i>

1203
01:10:20,112 --> 01:10:21,613
Well, I'm in.

1204
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,548
I just wanna get back
in the field.

1205
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:27,552
I like the money,
but I fuckin' love a mission.

1206
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:28,988
Yeah, but what's the downside?

1207
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:31,057
We're gonna be
way more exposed,

1208
01:10:31,123 --> 01:10:32,959
and it will warrant
significant planning.

1209
01:10:33,259 --> 01:10:36,195
There will be six weeks
of training and recon.

1210
01:11:13,933 --> 01:11:15,700
Three minutes.

1211
01:11:22,842 --> 01:11:24,810
Who the fuck are these clowns?

1212
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:32,351
Gonna be a problem?

1213
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:33,953
I don't think so.

1214
01:11:34,453 --> 01:11:36,222
Five, on the car. Handle it.

1215
01:11:36,288 --> 01:11:37,289
On it.

1216
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:40,625
Time to go to work, boys.

1217
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:45,031
You gotta get
these hinges greased, Mick.

1218
01:11:49,969 --> 01:11:51,837
What is this?

1219
01:11:59,644 --> 01:12:01,047
Freeway's
gonna be backed up.

1220
01:12:01,113 --> 01:12:02,248
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit!

1221
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:05,918
Let's go! Reverse! Reverse!

1222
01:12:14,794 --> 01:12:15,961
<i>Unit 14, clear.</i>

1223
01:12:16,028 --> 01:12:17,163
Still no response.

1224
01:12:23,536 --> 01:12:24,804
Thirty seconds.

1225
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:30,476
Yo, out of
the fuckin' car, come on!

1226
01:12:30,543 --> 01:12:32,511
Don't fuckin' look at me!
Out of the fuckin' car!

1227
01:12:32,577 --> 01:12:34,146
They don't pay you
enough to act a fool, let's go.

1228
01:12:34,213 --> 01:12:35,680
Get your motherfucking
ass down.

1229
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:37,383
All right! All right!

1230
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,784
<i>Fortico 1377.
Alarm raised.</i>

1231
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:40,319
Alarm registered.

1232
01:12:40,386 --> 01:12:41,887
Face to
the fucking ground!

1233
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:44,023
- Tires, now.
- Move!

1234
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:45,791
Do what we say
and you fucking live.

1235
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:48,127
<i>Bravo,
two black-and-whites en route.</i>

1236
01:12:48,194 --> 01:12:49,995
- <i>Two minutes away.</i>
- Two units dispatched.

1237
01:12:54,867 --> 01:12:56,368
Don't do it.

1238
01:12:56,435 --> 01:12:57,635
<i>ETA, two minutes.</i>

1239
01:12:57,702 --> 01:12:59,004
Two minutes!

1240
01:13:00,672 --> 01:13:01,807
Come on, Charlie!

1241
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:04,944
No! No...

1242
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,046
Fuck!

1243
01:13:07,113 --> 01:13:08,613
He shot
two fucking guards, Elvis.

1244
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,116
<i>He shot two fucking guards!</i>

1245
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:12,251
Number one,
are we good?

1246
01:13:12,318 --> 01:13:14,320
Are we good,
number one?

1247
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,988
We're good.

1248
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:30,635
Number one just shot
a fuckin' kid!

1249
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,071
<i>He shot a fuckin' kid!</i>

1250
01:13:32,138 --> 01:13:33,638
Dougie!

1251
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:35,207
Incoming!
Incoming on the right!

1252
01:13:35,274 --> 01:13:36,909
- Five, incoming!
- I'm on it!

1253
01:13:36,976 --> 01:13:38,978
Take the legs!

1254
01:13:40,112 --> 01:13:41,947
What the fuck
did you just do?

1255
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:43,916
I said the fucking legs.

1256
01:13:43,983 --> 01:13:45,717
Three, take his gun.

1257
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:46,452
<i>Okay, we got one minute.</i>

1258
01:13:46,919 --> 01:13:48,154
<i>Let's go!</i>

1259
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,456
- Move.
- <i>Exit west!</i>

1260
01:13:50,523 --> 01:13:52,525
- <i>We gotta go, Elvis! Come on!</i>
- What the fuck?

1261
01:13:52,591 --> 01:13:54,293
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's move. Move, move!

1262
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,693
B-team, let's go, let's go!

1263
01:14:36,135 --> 01:14:37,603
Gotta tell you, man.

1264
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,572
Was surprised
to hear from you.

1265
01:14:39,638 --> 01:14:41,240
Glad we could all make it.

1266
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:45,077
Yeah, I'm glad
that shit blew over.

1267
01:14:45,144 --> 01:14:46,946
You put us
in a tight spot, Jan.

1268
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:49,181
I'm not sure
it has all blown over.

1269
01:14:49,515 --> 01:14:51,817
You're lucky you still got
a seat at this table.

1270
01:14:53,519 --> 01:14:55,054
Got it.

1271
01:14:59,325 --> 01:15:01,560
I think we all know we're
gonna need a pension fund.

1272
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:03,963
I can't say I wasn't pleased
to have this meeting.

1273
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:05,731
I was startin' to itch.

1274
01:15:05,798 --> 01:15:07,399
But as we are aware,

1275
01:15:07,466 --> 01:15:09,868
the bigger the reward,
the bigger the risk.

1276
01:15:10,169 --> 01:15:11,737
Everything comes at a price.

1277
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:13,572
Are you ready for that?

1278
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:16,475
'Cause there is no guarantee
of success on this one.

1279
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:20,946
None of this was ever really
guaranteed, was it, Sarge?

1280
01:15:22,881 --> 01:15:24,550
We've been through worse.

1281
01:15:24,717 --> 01:15:25,884
Yeah, so lay it on us.

1282
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:27,419
We're dyin' to find out.

1283
01:15:28,354 --> 01:15:30,389
We do this right,

1284
01:15:30,856 --> 01:15:32,825
we'll never
have to work again.

1285
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:34,360
Neither will our kids.

1286
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:35,828
If we get it wrong?

1287
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:37,963
It's game over.

1288
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:42,434
So, what is it?

1289
01:15:44,738 --> 01:15:47,606
We're not hitting
a cash truck.

1290
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:49,341
We're hitting them all.

1291
01:15:50,175 --> 01:15:51,777
How is that possible?

1292
01:15:52,778 --> 01:15:54,580
The depot.

1293
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:56,081
Black Friday.

1294
01:15:59,385 --> 01:16:00,586
How much?

1295
01:16:01,153 --> 01:16:03,522
North of 150 million.

1296
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:05,324
Ooh!

1297
01:16:09,261 --> 01:16:11,363
We've got eight weeks
of recon and planning.

1298
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,037
Base, this is Gamma reportin'.

1299
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:29,048
<i>Incoming vehicle,
Gamma 2411 to Bay 6.</i>

1300
01:16:43,996 --> 01:16:47,801
That's 160 million
divided seven ways.

1301
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,803
<i>We have every avenue covered.</i>

1302
01:16:49,868 --> 01:16:51,437
Incomin', Mr. Rossi.

1303
01:16:51,503 --> 01:16:53,138
Thank you, Mr. Hill.
Sign it in.

1304
01:16:53,205 --> 01:16:55,074
This is our best plan.

1305
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,810
Yeah.
All this is for nothing

1306
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:58,610
if our guy
doesn't come through.

1307
01:16:58,977 --> 01:17:01,280
Why does this room
always smell so good?

1308
01:17:01,347 --> 01:17:03,382
Maybe one day,
my garden can smell like this.

1309
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:05,951
I hope you're not
plannin' anything, Dave.

1310
01:17:06,018 --> 01:17:07,720
Well, it's Black Friday
tomorrow,

1311
01:17:07,986 --> 01:17:09,756
so you'll have
to wait and see.

1312
01:17:09,823 --> 01:17:11,223
If I thought you were serious,

1313
01:17:11,290 --> 01:17:12,424
I'd have to report you,
you know.

1314
01:17:12,658 --> 01:17:14,226
'Course I'm not serious.

1315
01:17:14,293 --> 01:17:15,661
Or am I?

1316
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:19,531
Anyway, it's Action Man
you gotta look out for,

1317
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:20,834
not me.

1318
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:22,568
Yeah, colder than a reptile.

1319
01:17:23,068 --> 01:17:24,937
Something's not right.

1320
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:26,572
But why do I get the feeling

1321
01:17:26,638 --> 01:17:28,207
your money's never been safer,
Mr. Rossi?

1322
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:30,175
<i>You don't need to worry.</i>

1323
01:17:30,242 --> 01:17:31,877
He's greedier than you, Tom.
He'll come through.

1324
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:35,047
Okay, let's run through it
one more time.

1325
01:17:39,118 --> 01:17:41,019
Has anyone seen my clutch?

1326
01:17:41,086 --> 01:17:42,221
Your... Your what?

1327
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,056
My purse, sweetheart.

1328
01:17:44,123 --> 01:17:45,657
Uh, there's a green one
on the landing.

1329
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:47,326
- Thank you, Lexie.
- Oh, yeah. Come on.

1330
01:17:47,393 --> 01:17:48,927
What are you doing today, Dad?

1331
01:17:48,994 --> 01:17:50,963
- Uh, I got work.
- At the mall?

1332
01:17:51,029 --> 01:17:52,398
That's right.

1333
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:54,099
Will you come
to my game after?

1334
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,769
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1335
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:57,469
- Okay, let's go!
- Come on, Mom, let's go.

1336
01:17:57,536 --> 01:17:59,138
- Love you, Dad!
- Bye. Love you!

1337
01:17:59,204 --> 01:18:01,006
- Bye, Dad!
- Love you.

1338
01:18:01,073 --> 01:18:02,107
- Love you, honey.
- I love you.

1339
01:18:02,174 --> 01:18:03,175
Come on!

1340
01:18:03,275 --> 01:18:04,376
Hey...

1341
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:06,178
I'm gonna be late for work.

1342
01:18:06,245 --> 01:18:07,579
I love you.

1343
01:18:07,646 --> 01:18:08,647
Hurry up, Mom!

1344
01:18:08,714 --> 01:18:10,215
Okay, bye!

1345
01:18:11,383 --> 01:18:12,618
Come on, kids,

1346
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:13,820
get in the car!

1347
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,995
<i>Go.</i>

1348
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:24,764
We're all set on our end.

1349
01:18:24,831 --> 01:18:27,633
I'm on my way to pick up Jan.

1350
01:18:27,699 --> 01:18:29,601
Now, it's all up to you.

1351
01:18:32,137 --> 01:18:33,672
<i>Remember,</i>

1352
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:35,641
take different routes
there and back.

1353
01:18:35,707 --> 01:18:39,311
Even a sniff of anything
untoward and you call it in.

1354
01:18:39,378 --> 01:18:43,248
This is Black Friday, and
the tills will keep ringin'.

1355
01:18:43,315 --> 01:18:45,551
So, don't take no chances.

1356
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:49,856
We got close to 180 million
comin' in here today.

1357
01:18:50,790 --> 01:18:53,225
- Have you got it?
- Got it, boss!

1358
01:18:54,092 --> 01:18:57,696
I want everything
and everyone back.

1359
01:18:57,764 --> 01:18:59,732
Safe and sound.

1360
01:18:59,799 --> 01:19:01,633
Let's get goin', H.

1361
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:11,610
What?

1362
01:19:11,977 --> 01:19:13,579
You don't like it?

1363
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:17,115
How does someone like you
afford a place like this

1364
01:19:17,182 --> 01:19:20,052
and a $28,000 bike?

1365
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,287
Credit card.

1366
01:19:22,454 --> 01:19:24,456
Calm down,
it's not in my name.

1367
01:19:24,523 --> 01:19:25,557
Return it.

1368
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:30,462
Put the beers down,
grab your gear, and let's go.

1369
01:19:32,464 --> 01:19:33,999
Let's go!

1370
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,313
That's the last drop-off.

1371
01:20:08,768 --> 01:20:10,737
What is it?

1372
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:15,374
You know I like you, right, H?

1373
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:21,446
Well, there's somethin'
I need to tell you.

1374
01:20:21,513 --> 01:20:23,382
About me.

1375
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:27,286
I've got some friends.

1376
01:20:28,053 --> 01:20:29,889
I help 'em out.

1377
01:20:30,722 --> 01:20:33,191
They help me out
from time to time.

1378
01:20:35,227 --> 01:20:36,763
My pals,

1379
01:20:37,429 --> 01:20:40,432
I helped 'em get
into the cash truck game,

1380
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:42,601
in a manner of speaking.

1381
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:46,071
With me on the inside.

1382
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:48,640
You get me?

1383
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:51,744
Nah, Bullet,

1384
01:20:53,478 --> 01:20:54,713
I don't.

1385
01:20:55,414 --> 01:20:58,183
I tell them
which trucks to hit

1386
01:20:58,918 --> 01:21:00,385
and they hit 'em.

1387
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:04,656
The two guards being killed
was necessary.

1388
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,492
The boy was unfortunate.

1389
01:21:09,028 --> 01:21:11,129
<i>But we're a winning team.</i>

1390
01:21:11,196 --> 01:21:13,565
<i>Militarily precise.</i>

1391
01:21:16,234 --> 01:21:18,370
You with me now?

1392
01:21:18,905 --> 01:21:20,238
Yeah.

1393
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:24,877
I'm with you 100%.

1394
01:21:26,211 --> 01:21:27,780
Continue.

1395
01:21:27,981 --> 01:21:30,750
For starters, there are
no bullets in your gun.

1396
01:21:30,984 --> 01:21:32,517
Secondly, I have to tell you,

1397
01:21:32,584 --> 01:21:35,387
they will kill you
if you don't comply.

1398
01:21:35,454 --> 01:21:38,290
So, do as I say,
and you won't get hurt.

1399
01:21:41,493 --> 01:21:43,062
And why do you need me?

1400
01:21:43,362 --> 01:21:45,832
We need somethin' super-sized.

1401
01:21:46,398 --> 01:21:48,667
So we can walk away for good.

1402
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:52,571
We want the jackpot.

1403
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:56,708
The depot.

1404
01:21:57,643 --> 01:21:59,112
You want me to get you in.

1405
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:02,214
Then you can look
the other way.

1406
01:22:04,483 --> 01:22:06,318
When, Bullet?

1407
01:22:07,954 --> 01:22:09,554
Today.

1408
01:22:10,923 --> 01:22:13,291
There's no turning back.

1409
01:22:14,894 --> 01:22:16,695
And what's in it for me?

1410
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:19,698
Your life.

1411
01:22:25,537 --> 01:22:27,239
Do we have a deal?

1412
01:22:34,147 --> 01:22:35,647
Yeah.

1413
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:37,349
We have a deal.

1414
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:43,990
<i>We're on. ETA, two minutes.</i>

1415
01:22:44,057 --> 01:22:45,390
Covers.

1416
01:23:16,823 --> 01:23:19,424
<i>Gamma, this is Base,
you copy? Over.</i>

1417
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,495
Base, this is Gamma,
we copy. Over.

1418
01:23:23,562 --> 01:23:25,464
Gamma, I've lost
camera signal in your truck.

1419
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:27,466
What's happenin' there? Over.

1420
01:23:27,532 --> 01:23:28,935
<i>It's nothing
to worry about, Base.</i>

1421
01:23:29,001 --> 01:23:30,635
I'm fixin' it as we speak.

1422
01:23:30,702 --> 01:23:32,772
<i>Copy that, Gamma.
Keep me updated.</i>

1423
01:23:32,839 --> 01:23:34,207
<i>This ain't the day
for this shit,</i>

1424
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,507
<i>you understand me? Over.</i>

1425
01:23:35,574 --> 01:23:37,242
Loud and clear.

1426
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:39,344
I'll be in touch as soon as.
Over.

1427
01:23:43,082 --> 01:23:44,616
We're set.

1428
01:23:44,683 --> 01:23:46,152
<i>Cameras are disarmed.</i>

1429
01:23:46,219 --> 01:23:48,821
We have four minutes to load.

1430
01:23:48,888 --> 01:23:51,090
We meet here at point A.

1431
01:23:51,523 --> 01:23:53,558
Warn our hero
not to get clever.

1432
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,427
We'll need him to get inside.

1433
01:23:55,494 --> 01:23:56,863
After that,
if he twitches, kill him.

1434
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:05,704
Just let 'em do their jobs,
okay?

1435
01:24:05,772 --> 01:24:07,807
<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

1436
01:24:09,407 --> 01:24:11,010
<i>Hey, handsome.</i>

1437
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:14,847
<i>Today is not the day
to be a hero.</i>

1438
01:24:14,914 --> 01:24:17,250
<i>There will be
no other warnings.</i>

1439
01:24:17,516 --> 01:24:20,418
<i>Am I clear?</i>

1440
01:24:20,787 --> 01:24:23,156
<i>Show me your hands.</i>

1441
01:24:25,657 --> 01:24:27,559
Play the game, H.

1442
01:24:45,577 --> 01:24:47,814
<i>If you're a good boy today,</i>

1443
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:50,817
<i>you'll see tomorrow.</i>

1444
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:05,397
Then, we divide.

1445
01:25:05,463 --> 01:25:07,800
You, Brad, Carlos, and Jan
are in the truck.

1446
01:25:07,867 --> 01:25:10,402
Me and Sam
follow in the Escalade.

1447
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,098
Be cool, H.

1448
01:25:39,397 --> 01:25:41,366
2411 returning.

1449
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:43,769
Gamma, this is Base, go. Over.

1450
01:25:59,285 --> 01:26:00,685
All good?

1451
01:26:00,753 --> 01:26:02,387
Yeah, except for traffic.

1452
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:03,823
Dana,
come give me a hand.

1453
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:05,490
- Yeah, no problem.
- Right.

1454
01:26:05,557 --> 01:26:07,193
Let's relieve you
of your burden.

1455
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:17,036
Base, this is Gamma reporting.

1456
01:26:23,376 --> 01:26:24,810
All clear, Gamma.

1457
01:26:26,245 --> 01:26:27,479
You ready?

1458
01:26:28,546 --> 01:26:29,949
Ready.

1459
01:26:30,883 --> 01:26:33,652
<i>Gamma 2411 to Bay 5.</i>

1460
01:26:33,718 --> 01:26:35,288
<i>That's the last one for today.</i>

1461
01:26:35,354 --> 01:26:37,089
Once we get
past the gates,

1462
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:39,025
it's only a question of time
before we're compromised.

1463
01:26:39,091 --> 01:26:40,860
There's too many guards
that we can't control,

1464
01:26:40,927 --> 01:26:42,727
so we keep it quiet
as long as possible.

1465
01:26:42,795 --> 01:26:44,897
The men must be stealthy.

1466
01:26:44,964 --> 01:26:47,532
The longer their stealth, the
longer we live without drama.

1467
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,769
Hey, Bullet. All good?

1468
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:51,337
All good here, Supe.

1469
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,874
<i>Move. Move. Now, move! Go!</i>

1470
01:26:54,941 --> 01:26:56,708
- Whoa... Whoa.
- <i>Uh-uh-uh.</i>

1471
01:26:56,776 --> 01:26:58,576
<i>Don't you
fuckin' make a sound.</i>

1472
01:26:58,643 --> 01:26:59,711
<i>Down on the ground.</i>

1473
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:01,080
<i>Move.</i>

1474
01:27:01,613 --> 01:27:03,149
Okay, I'm down.

1475
01:27:03,816 --> 01:27:05,384
<i>Tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe.</i>

1476
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,286
We secure the safe first.

1477
01:27:07,353 --> 01:27:09,088
That's Carlos and Jan's job.

1478
01:27:09,155 --> 01:27:10,923
Okay, Dave, that's
all good and accounted for.

1479
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:12,657
<i>Hands in the air!</i>

1480
01:27:12,724 --> 01:27:14,293
<i>Hands in
the motherfuckin' air!</i>

1481
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,593
<i>Toss your weapons
on the ground.</i>

1482
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:16,963
<i>Slowly. Slowly.</i>

1483
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:18,998
Do what he says.
Do what he says.

1484
01:27:19,065 --> 01:27:20,933
<i>Take that weapon out.
Slide it over.</i>

1485
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,335
<i>Get over there!
Get on the fuckin' ground!</i>

1486
01:27:22,567 --> 01:27:24,203
<i>The fuck is wrong with you?</i>

1487
01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:26,038
<i>Grab your gun,
put it on the ground,</i>

1488
01:27:26,105 --> 01:27:28,107
<i>and kick it to me,
motherfucker!</i>

1489
01:27:28,174 --> 01:27:29,708
- David, please.
- <i>You wanna be a hero today?</i>

1490
01:27:29,775 --> 01:27:31,777
<i>I'll put you on the front page</i>

1491
01:27:31,844 --> 01:27:32,979
<i>of every fuckin' newspaper
in America. Try me.</i>

1492
01:27:36,514 --> 01:27:37,783
<i>Get on the ground.</i>

1493
01:27:38,516 --> 01:27:39,584
<i>All the way!</i>

1494
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,021
<i>Get your fuckin' ass
on the ground!</i>

1495
01:27:42,088 --> 01:27:43,655
<i>Tie his ass up.</i>

1496
01:27:49,261 --> 01:27:51,629
<i>Behave yourself.</i>

1497
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:55,134
- Hey.
- What's up?

1498
01:27:55,201 --> 01:27:57,436
Yo, I need you to sign this
birthday card for the boss.

1499
01:27:57,502 --> 01:27:59,138
Bring it up here
and have a look at this.

1500
01:27:59,205 --> 01:28:01,040
This will make you laugh.

1501
01:28:01,107 --> 01:28:02,942
You, Jan, and Brad
will take the control room.

1502
01:28:03,009 --> 01:28:05,510
- <i>Bullet is hostage and shield.</i>
- <i>Shh.</i>

1503
01:28:06,846 --> 01:28:08,481
If that doesn't work,
we blow our way in.

1504
01:28:09,415 --> 01:28:11,117
<i>Keep it fucking quiet.</i>

1505
01:28:16,255 --> 01:28:17,722
- <i>Open the gate.</i>
- Whoa.

1506
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:21,726
Bob?

1507
01:28:21,794 --> 01:28:23,561
What the fuck is goin' on?

1508
01:28:23,628 --> 01:28:25,865
<i>The keypad
will present a challenge.</i>

1509
01:28:25,931 --> 01:28:27,967
<i>The men that operate
the armory are hard-boiled.</i>

1510
01:28:28,034 --> 01:28:29,902
They will not be scared
of pulling the trigger.

1511
01:28:29,969 --> 01:28:31,370
<i>At some point, they'll resist.</i>

1512
01:28:31,737 --> 01:28:33,638
<i>Open the gate,</i>

1513
01:28:33,705 --> 01:28:36,008
<i>or I'll blow
his fuckin' head off.</i>

1514
01:28:36,442 --> 01:28:39,111
<i>You have three seconds.</i>

1515
01:28:39,178 --> 01:28:40,413
<i>One!</i>

1516
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:42,448
<i>Two! Three!</i>

1517
01:28:42,515 --> 01:28:44,483
Okay! Putting the gun down!

1518
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:45,951
<i>Open the gate.</i>

1519
01:28:46,018 --> 01:28:47,386
The keypad is out there.

1520
01:28:47,453 --> 01:28:48,888
<i>You use the keypad.</i>

1521
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:50,389
It's on security lockdown!

1522
01:28:50,456 --> 01:28:52,258
You use the fuckin' keypad!

1523
01:28:53,092 --> 01:28:55,394
<i>The rabbits have run,
number one.</i>

1524
01:28:55,461 --> 01:28:57,263
<i>Two, breach the gate.</i>

1525
01:28:57,329 --> 01:28:59,131
At some point, we're gonna
come under heavy fire.

1526
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:00,866
They got long guns,
they're gonna use 'em.

1527
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:02,868
Here you go.
Here, take this, chief.

1528
01:29:02,935 --> 01:29:04,470
So, we'll need
ballistic plates.

1529
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:06,571
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

1530
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:09,508
<i>I'll blow his head off.</i>

1531
01:29:09,574 --> 01:29:11,609
Bob, open the gate, or they're
gonna fuckin' kill me!

1532
01:29:11,676 --> 01:29:13,112
Bullet, get down!

1533
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:18,317
Holy shit!

1534
01:29:20,585 --> 01:29:22,054
<i>Set!</i>

1535
01:29:26,826 --> 01:29:28,160
<i>Nobody fuckin' move!</i>

1536
01:29:28,227 --> 01:29:29,627
<i>Number three, what's goin' on?</i>

1537
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:33,766
<i>Don't do it!</i>

1538
01:29:36,969 --> 01:29:39,071
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1539
01:29:42,908 --> 01:29:44,243
Now!

1540
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:56,989
<i>Move now! Move!</i>

1541
01:30:23,449 --> 01:30:25,017
<i>Where are you hit?</i>

1542
01:30:25,084 --> 01:30:26,552
<i>Where are you hit?</i>

1543
01:30:27,086 --> 01:30:30,156
<i>Four is down.
Elvis, repeat, four is down.</i>

1544
01:30:36,362 --> 01:30:37,796
Oh, no! No, no, no!

1545
01:30:37,863 --> 01:30:39,031
No, Jesus,
sweet Mary and Joseph,

1546
01:30:39,098 --> 01:30:40,866
I swear to God! Please...

1547
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:42,635
<i>Mm, look at
this little piggy...</i>

1548
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,004
Please, don't.
I got kids, please. Please!

1549
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,972
<i>What do we
have here, huh? Motherfucker.</i>

1550
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:49,041
Don't hurt me! Please!

1551
01:30:51,744 --> 01:30:52,845
<i>Enough of that.</i>

1552
01:30:56,782 --> 01:30:58,984
<i>Elvis, come and play.</i>

1553
01:31:04,390 --> 01:31:06,559
<i>...a bike from an open garage.</i>

1554
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:09,094
<i>Officers have now located
the suspect and the bicycle...</i>

1555
01:31:12,565 --> 01:31:14,934
<i>One, sweep
the rest of the building.</i>

1556
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,268
<i>Copy.</i>

1557
01:31:24,076 --> 01:31:25,544
<i>Five, are we good?</i>

1558
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:27,213
<i>Clear, Elvis. Move in.</i>

1559
01:31:29,048 --> 01:31:31,750
<i>Traffic
stopped on Highland and Third.</i>

1560
01:31:34,386 --> 01:31:36,222
<i>Welcome to the party.</i>

1561
01:31:36,822 --> 01:31:39,592
<i>These three are hog-tied.
The guap is in here.</i>

1562
01:31:40,059 --> 01:31:42,127
<i>And another three guards
in the back.</i>

1563
01:31:42,194 --> 01:31:44,029
<i>Fortico, reported
robbery. SWAT alerted.</i>

1564
01:31:44,096 --> 01:31:46,165
SWAT have been alerted.

1565
01:32:00,746 --> 01:32:02,014
<i>SWAT has been notified.</i>

1566
01:32:02,081 --> 01:32:04,083
<i>All units, please respond.</i>

1567
01:32:05,818 --> 01:32:08,120
<i>Once the alarm sounds,</i>

1568
01:32:08,187 --> 01:32:10,789
black-and-whites will be
on scene within minutes,

1569
01:32:10,856 --> 01:32:12,558
but they cannot
enter the building.

1570
01:32:12,625 --> 01:32:14,960
<i>Even if they could,
they wouldn't dare.</i>

1571
01:32:15,027 --> 01:32:17,062
However,
they are not our problem.

1572
01:32:17,129 --> 01:32:20,299
We will have eight minutes
until SWAT arrives.

1573
01:32:23,135 --> 01:32:24,603
<i>We can punch through
the black-and-whites</i>

1574
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:26,338
<i>with an 18-ton cash truck,</i>

1575
01:32:26,405 --> 01:32:27,806
<i>but the SWAT truck's
a different story.</i>

1576
01:32:27,873 --> 01:32:29,575
We cannot get pinned down.

1577
01:32:29,642 --> 01:32:32,077
We gotta get out
before they seal the exit.

1578
01:32:32,144 --> 01:32:34,146
We're eight minutes out.
Eight minutes out.

1579
01:32:34,213 --> 01:32:35,981
<i>We have men down.
Send backup right now!</i>

1580
01:32:36,048 --> 01:32:37,416
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

1581
01:32:37,483 --> 01:32:38,817
They have
heavy assault weapons,

1582
01:32:38,884 --> 01:32:40,586
and they have body armor.

1583
01:32:40,653 --> 01:32:42,488
- Men are down.
- <i>Hold your positions.</i>

1584
01:32:42,554 --> 01:32:43,757
- Just get here now!
- What's going on?

1585
01:32:43,822 --> 01:32:45,491
Get in! Get in!

1586
01:32:45,557 --> 01:32:47,226
- We're callin' SWAT!
- I'm not waiting for SWAT.

1587
01:32:47,293 --> 01:32:48,727
We have a protocol.
We wait for SWAT.

1588
01:32:48,794 --> 01:32:49,662
No, no, no! We gotta go now!

1589
01:32:49,728 --> 01:32:50,863
Wait!

1590
01:32:55,968 --> 01:32:57,771
<i>Two,
wait until we're loaded,</i>

1591
01:32:57,836 --> 01:32:59,938
<i>then join three in the truck.</i>

1592
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:01,907
<i>Nose to the fuckin' ground!</i>

1593
01:33:03,809 --> 01:33:05,044
<i>Did I stutter?</i>

1594
01:33:11,317 --> 01:33:14,186
<i>Load the van, three.
I'll get five.</i>

1595
01:33:16,422 --> 01:33:17,956
<i>Fuck is goin' on
out there?</i>

1596
01:33:18,257 --> 01:33:19,725
<i>There's some
fuckin' guard out here.</i>

1597
01:33:19,793 --> 01:33:21,160
<i>Someone shoot this fucker!</i>

1598
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:34,073
Fuck! Please! Please!

1599
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,476
Shots have been fired!
Shots have been fired!

1600
01:33:49,188 --> 01:33:50,389
Seven minutes out.

1601
01:33:56,729 --> 01:33:57,963
Fuck!

1602
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,534
<i>Clear!</i>

1603
01:34:17,116 --> 01:34:18,650
No, fuck this! I'm goin' out!

1604
01:34:29,928 --> 01:34:33,365
Listen, the alarm's gone.
We should just wait for help.

1605
01:34:33,932 --> 01:34:36,201
What do you want us to do?

1606
01:34:37,737 --> 01:34:41,039
You can do
whatever you fuckin' like.

1607
01:34:49,314 --> 01:34:51,583
David, no, listen to me,
they got body armor.

1608
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:53,018
That gun will do nothing!

1609
01:34:53,085 --> 01:34:54,720
And this is not your money.

1610
01:34:54,788 --> 01:34:55,954
Now, let's go.

1611
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:58,490
Let's fucking go! Go! Go!

1612
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:05,397
We're six minutes out!

1613
01:35:16,175 --> 01:35:18,477
<i>One, four is down.</i>

1614
01:35:18,544 --> 01:35:21,346
<i>I repeat, four is down.
Do you have eyes on three?</i>

1615
01:35:22,816 --> 01:35:24,116
<i>Three, respond.</i>

1616
01:35:26,318 --> 01:35:27,453
<i>Who's firing?</i>

1617
01:35:34,493 --> 01:35:36,195
<i>Copy that, Adam.
All units are advised...</i>

1618
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:37,963
<i>Three is down.</i>

1619
01:35:38,497 --> 01:35:40,399
<i>We've got a rat on the loose.</i>

1620
01:35:40,466 --> 01:35:42,267
<i>Intel suggests
multiple armed suspects.</i>

1621
01:35:42,334 --> 01:35:43,969
<i>Elvis is leaving
the building.</i>

1622
01:35:46,438 --> 01:35:48,474
David, just put
the gun down and hide.

1623
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,309
The SWAT team, they're on
the way. They're on the way.

1624
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:51,945
Well, if someone
comes down the hallway,

1625
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:53,512
I'm gonna
fuckin' shoot 'em, Terry!

1626
01:35:53,579 --> 01:35:54,881
There's no need to...
There is no need.

1627
01:35:55,547 --> 01:35:56,682
<i>I'm making my way
to you now, Elvis.</i>

1628
01:35:59,117 --> 01:36:00,519
<i>Fuck!</i>

1629
01:36:02,521 --> 01:36:04,423
<i>Come on out
and you won't get hurt.</i>

1630
01:36:06,692 --> 01:36:09,228
<i>Come on! Come here!
I'm not gonna hurt you!</i>

1631
01:36:20,974 --> 01:36:23,108
<i>Come on! Fuck! Move!</i>

1632
01:36:23,175 --> 01:36:24,610
Send SWAT.
Send choppers.

1633
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:26,078
Bring someone in
right the fuck now!

1634
01:36:26,144 --> 01:36:28,046
Here. Take this.

1635
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:39,859
Listen, man down.

1636
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,668
<i>Stay down!</i>

1637
01:36:55,407 --> 01:36:57,042
- <i>Four minutes out.</i>
- We're four minutes out.

1638
01:37:21,166 --> 01:37:22,401
No!

1639
01:38:06,445 --> 01:38:08,347
David, you all right?

1640
01:38:20,225 --> 01:38:21,493
<i>We're sitting ducks here.</i>

1641
01:38:28,367 --> 01:38:30,369
Stuart. Give me a gun.

1642
01:38:30,435 --> 01:38:32,170
It's fucking jammed!

1643
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:34,172
Give me a gun!

1644
01:38:35,674 --> 01:38:36,743
Thank you.

1645
01:38:37,509 --> 01:38:39,578
Bullet, what the...

1646
01:38:39,645 --> 01:38:41,446
- Clear!
- <i>We gotta move!</i>

1647
01:38:41,513 --> 01:38:42,749
- <i>Come on.</i>
- <i>Get up. Move.</i>

1648
01:38:44,683 --> 01:38:45,918
<i>We got two minutes
until SWAT is here.</i>

1649
01:38:46,119 --> 01:38:47,552
<i>Elvis, in the truck!</i>

1650
01:38:48,453 --> 01:38:49,721
<i>Clear!</i>

1651
01:38:52,257 --> 01:38:53,558
<i>Stay with me. Stay with me.</i>

1652
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,627
<i>Get in the truck.</i>

1653
01:38:55,694 --> 01:38:56,896
<i>Step on it.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

1654
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:12,611
Fuck!

1655
01:39:19,451 --> 01:39:20,686
<i>Four is down!</i>

1656
01:39:51,283 --> 01:39:52,584
Hey, Boy Sweat!

1657
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:54,319
It's Bullet!

1658
01:39:54,386 --> 01:39:55,687
Bullet?

1659
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:59,826
Come give me a hand.

1660
01:40:03,930 --> 01:40:05,263
Bullet, what the...

1661
01:40:19,578 --> 01:40:21,214
<i>On fence perimeter
of Fortico.</i>

1662
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:23,750
- You good?
- We're good. Let's go.

1663
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:46,638
Once the truck is loaded
and we're all in,

1664
01:40:46,705 --> 01:40:48,241
we punch through
the black-and-whites.

1665
01:40:48,573 --> 01:40:50,375
Exit right.

1666
01:40:50,442 --> 01:40:52,779
They and the choppers
will be in pursuit,

1667
01:40:53,112 --> 01:40:55,447
<i>but there's nothing
they can do to stop us.</i>

1668
01:40:55,948 --> 01:40:58,017
Oh, shit!
They're not stopping!

1669
01:40:58,283 --> 01:41:00,019
- Fuck! Get eyes in the sky!
- Heading west!

1670
01:41:00,086 --> 01:41:01,553
Let's go!

1671
01:41:07,526 --> 01:41:09,228
<i>That's a 136</i>

1672
01:41:09,294 --> 01:41:11,630
<i>south of Mateo Street
along the highway.</i>

1673
01:41:13,966 --> 01:41:15,400
Fuck!

1674
01:41:21,741 --> 01:41:24,376
From here, it's two
klicks to meet at rendez point

1675
01:41:24,442 --> 01:41:26,012
<i>to enter building D.</i>

1676
01:41:26,078 --> 01:41:28,047
The gates here will stop
any immediate intrusion.

1677
01:41:28,114 --> 01:41:30,448
<i>Heading south
on 405. We have visual.</i>

1678
01:41:30,515 --> 01:41:31,851
<i>We have four birds in the sky.</i>

1679
01:41:31,918 --> 01:41:33,786
<i>Air units in the vicinity.</i>

1680
01:41:33,853 --> 01:41:35,288
<i>Nine-Henry-zero, affirmative.</i>

1681
01:41:35,353 --> 01:41:36,454
That doesn't change a thing.

1682
01:41:36,621 --> 01:41:38,323
Just stick to the plan.

1683
01:41:40,293 --> 01:41:41,560
Get ready.

1684
01:41:57,844 --> 01:42:01,613
We will have five
minutes until SWAT breaches.

1685
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,448
They will think we're trapped.
They will shoot to kill,

1686
01:42:03,515 --> 01:42:05,017
but we won't be there.

1687
01:42:05,084 --> 01:42:06,853
And there's no way
that they can know

1688
01:42:06,919 --> 01:42:08,821
about this access tunnel
underneath the basement?

1689
01:42:08,888 --> 01:42:10,622
No, this doesn't
come up on any blueprints.

1690
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:12,357
They stopped printing this
back in '57.

1691
01:42:12,424 --> 01:42:13,692
<i>We have 'em surrounded.</i>

1692
01:42:13,759 --> 01:42:15,660
<i>SWAT has arrived on scene.</i>

1693
01:42:17,196 --> 01:42:19,966
A-team, let's go!
Into position.

1694
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:28,373
How you doin', Sarge?

1695
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:31,643
Gonna make it.

1696
01:42:31,710 --> 01:42:33,846
Get back there
and finish the job.

1697
01:42:33,913 --> 01:42:35,447
<i>We are stationary
and setting up a blockade.</i>

1698
01:42:35,513 --> 01:42:37,116
<i>Awaiting further orders.</i>

1699
01:42:40,152 --> 01:42:41,453
Go.

1700
01:42:44,156 --> 01:42:46,025
That's the last of it.
Let's move.

1701
01:42:46,092 --> 01:42:47,692
<i>All units,
you are cleared to fire.</i>

1702
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,128
<i>Roger, dispatch.</i>

1703
01:42:52,331 --> 01:42:53,698
<i>Eighteen seconds.</i>

1704
01:42:56,302 --> 01:42:58,536
Okay, I'll get the boss.

1705
01:42:59,839 --> 01:43:01,706
<i>All units</i>

1706
01:43:01,774 --> 01:43:03,843
<i>are advised
to watch out for assault.</i>

1707
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:05,778
<i>Targets have intent to kill
and are heavily armed.</i>

1708
01:43:05,845 --> 01:43:07,412
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1709
01:43:09,849 --> 01:43:12,651
Not gonna need that,
are we now, Sarge?

1710
01:43:38,177 --> 01:43:41,180
<i>We all understand the risks.</i>

1711
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:43,049
Some of us won't make it.

1712
01:43:43,849 --> 01:43:46,252
If there is
a last man standing,

1713
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:49,188
it's his job
to take care of the families.

1714
01:43:49,255 --> 01:43:51,791
I wish I was confident
that will happen,

1715
01:43:51,857 --> 01:43:54,459
but my only concern is Jan.

1716
01:43:54,927 --> 01:43:57,396
<i>Strange things happen to men</i>

1717
01:43:57,462 --> 01:43:59,799
<i>when they smell
that much cash.</i>

1718
01:44:00,532 --> 01:44:01,968
He's a soldier.

1719
01:44:02,034 --> 01:44:04,203
In the end,
he'll follow orders.

1720
01:44:07,807 --> 01:44:09,008
Where's the sarge?

1721
01:44:09,075 --> 01:44:10,508
He's not comin'.

1722
01:44:10,575 --> 01:44:11,978
What do you mean,
"He's not coming"?

1723
01:44:12,044 --> 01:44:14,612
I mean he's fuckin' dead,
Bullet!

1724
01:44:42,108 --> 01:44:43,943
From here,
we load the Can-Am quads,

1725
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:45,945
ride three more klicks
to the silver Prius,

1726
01:44:46,012 --> 01:44:48,447
load the cash under cover.

1727
01:44:49,148 --> 01:44:53,618
And whoever's left
takes the construction pickup.

1728
01:45:33,658 --> 01:45:34,760
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

1729
01:45:34,827 --> 01:45:36,628
Too fuckin' slow.

1730
01:46:02,154 --> 01:46:04,523
<i>All right, team.
Move in. Weapon ready.</i>

1731
01:46:04,589 --> 01:46:06,559
- <i>Copy!</i>
- <i>Eyes on the truck.</i>

1732
01:46:06,624 --> 01:46:08,626
<i>Suspect
still in vehicle. Moving in.</i>

1733
01:46:08,693 --> 01:46:09,995
- <i>Move!</i>
- <i>Go!</i>

1734
01:46:10,796 --> 01:46:12,031
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1735
01:46:12,098 --> 01:46:13,933
<i>Alpha Command, come in.</i>

1736
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,902
<i>We got one dead suspect.
The others are fuckin' gone!</i>

1737
01:46:16,969 --> 01:46:18,703
<i>We need more bodies
down here.</i>

1738
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:20,272
- Shit.
- <i>There's tunnels everywhere.</i>

1739
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:21,874
Captain.

1740
01:46:21,941 --> 01:46:23,776
There's a network
of underground tunnels.

1741
01:46:23,843 --> 01:46:25,578
It's like a fucking rabbit
warren down there.

1742
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:27,813
<i>We need more air cover
on East Terminal Island.</i>

1743
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:29,148
<i>Ground support,
set up a blockade</i>

1744
01:46:29,215 --> 01:46:31,016
<i>on Vincent Thomas Bridge.</i>

1745
01:46:31,083 --> 01:46:32,485
<i>This is Hunter 45
with the FBI.</i>

1746
01:46:33,052 --> 01:46:35,121
<i>We need
more air support up here.</i>

1747
01:46:35,187 --> 01:46:37,123
<i>Victor 365,
cover over Seaside Freeway.</i>

1748
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:39,458
<i>737,
we do not have visual.</i>

1749
01:46:39,525 --> 01:46:41,360
<i>We need more eyes in the sky.</i>

1750
01:46:41,427 --> 01:46:43,462
<i>Copy that.
Additional air units inbound</i>

1751
01:46:43,529 --> 01:46:45,097
<i>covering Long Beach dock.</i>

1752

<i>Entering industrial unit
on Terminal Way.</i>

1753
01:46:47,066 --> 01:46:48,968
<i>We need
more choppers up here.</i>

1754
01:46:49,034 --> 01:46:50,769
<i>There are tunnels
coming out everywhere.</i>

1755
01:48:43,983 --> 01:48:46,385
Ain't you gonna answer it?

1756
01:48:56,562 --> 01:48:57,963
What do you want?

1757
01:49:00,799 --> 01:49:02,468
You here for the money?

1758
01:49:03,836 --> 01:49:05,938
I don't want the money.

1759
01:49:07,539 --> 01:49:09,174
I want you to read this.

1760
01:49:21,453 --> 01:49:22,921
"Bullets A-1 and A-2

1761
01:49:22,988 --> 01:49:25,924
"entered the right lung,
causing collapse.

1762
01:49:26,425 --> 01:49:29,595
"Bullet B-1
penetrated the liver,

1763
01:49:30,029 --> 01:49:33,032
"and B-2 ruptured the spleen.

1764
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:39,438
"Bullets C-1 and C-2
lacerated the heart.

1765
01:49:39,938 --> 01:49:42,608
"Cause of death,
blood loss and trauma.

1766
01:49:42,808 --> 01:49:45,010
"Manner of death, homicide."

1767
01:50:00,426 --> 01:50:01,460
In summary,

1768
01:50:03,062 --> 01:50:06,766
the liver, the lungs,

1769
01:50:06,832 --> 01:50:10,269
the spleen, and the heart.

1770
01:50:12,905 --> 01:50:14,808
What the fuck do you want?

1771
01:50:15,074 --> 01:50:16,408
I want your liver.

1772
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:18,310
Aah!

1773
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:22,848
Fuck...

1774
01:50:26,151 --> 01:50:27,386
Your lungs.

1775
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:36,061
Your spleen.

1776
01:50:47,139 --> 01:50:48,374
By the way,

1777
01:50:51,745 --> 01:50:53,479
his name was Dougie.

1778
01:51:43,863 --> 01:51:45,330
Are we done?

1779
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:48,033
We're done.
