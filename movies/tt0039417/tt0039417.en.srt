GERMANY YEAR ZERO

3
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:44,669
DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY
OF MY SON ROMANO

4
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,662
The Russian sector had jam yesterday,
and the Yanks had margarine.

5
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,366
So they'll slap honey
on bread for us. As always.

6
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,201
I'm sick and tired of it all.

7
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,472
In that case,
jump in that grave.

8
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,080
Enough talk about being tired.

9
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:36,951
Didn't I say 6.5 x 5 x 2 feet?

10
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,157
We're not digging for potatoes here.

11
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,623
That kid isn't pulling his weight!

12
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,319
- What's he doing here anyway?
- How old are you?

13
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,089
- Fifteen.
- He's lying!

14
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,200
If he's 13, I'll eat my hat.

15
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,565
He's only 12.
He goes to school with my boy.

16
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,365
- Is that true?
- Leave me alone!

17
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,064
Where's your work permit?

18
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,469
In my bag.

19
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,806
I'm sure it's forged.
These scamps will try anything.

20
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,210
If you want to work here, kid,
you need a work permit.

21
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,980
I want a piece too.

22
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,514
Get lost.

23
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,618
Go on, scram.

24
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,364
Leave that coal alone,
you rascal.

25
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,804
Just wait till I get
my hands on you.

26
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,312
What's going on?

27
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,643
It's the man
from the power company.

28
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,916
You went over by 62 kilowatts.

29
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,218
- I knew it.
- There are 10 of us living here.

30
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,020
Five separate households.

31
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,130
That's no excuse.
You can expect a steep fine.

32
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,391
- Got any cigarettes?
- I gave them all away.

33
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,795
These are my last.

34
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,629
- What about you?
- No.

35
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,238
- Did you bring back anything?
- Just some coal.

36
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,635
All right. I'll carry the excess
over to next month.

37
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,375
This is not to happen again.

38
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,042
Last week it was the gas,
now the electricity.

39
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,245
Next you'll all be
stumbling in the dark.

40
00:05:56,422 --> 00:06:00,119
We need stricter rules.
From now on, no hot water.

41
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,261
We can't run around like pigs.

42
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:06,023
I always use cold water.
Nobody can say I'm dirty.

43
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,326
Can I still use
my hairdryer, Papa?

44
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,492
Keep quiet.

45
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,763
I'll sort it out with the Kohlers.

46
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,102
Let him talk.
Don't do anything stupid.

47
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,072
- Is everything okay?
- Yes.

48
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,178
All that fuss with their father -

49
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:24,214
tea, hot-water bottles,
hot compresses.

50
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,874
This can't go on.

51
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,350
Don't forget he's a sick man.

52
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,957
Sick! We're all sick.
No one has it any better.

53
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,319
I know, but -

54
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,326
Easy for you to say.
You have no idea what we went through.

55
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,858
- Is everything okay.
- Yes, don't worry.

56
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,330
What was all that about?

57
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,028
They read the meter.
Too much power.

58
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,305
- So they're cutting off the power?
- We talked him out of it.

59
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,838
You got all dirty again.

60
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,242
Did you get the Level 2 card?

61
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,883
No, they found out I wasn't 15.

62
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,713
That's easy to see.
I knew that would happen.

63
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,356
Actually, I'm glad it did.

64
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,890
That's no work
for a 13-year-old boy.

65
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:10,085
It would have meant more to eat.
For Karl-Heinz too.

66
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,094
You hear that...

67
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,960
Karl-Heinz?

68
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:18,900
Do you understand that
your brother is shouldering

69
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,971
the entire burden
of our existence by himself?

70
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,938
And you?

71
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,771
What do you do?

72
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,708
You go on hiding.

73
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,840
You didn't even register
and get a ration card.

74
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:37,145
How can four people get by
on only three food cards?

75
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,282
We can't afford
the black market.

76
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,186
We've sold everything.

77
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:48,091
I'd do anything for you,

78
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,827
anything within my weak powers,

79
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,996
but in my condition -

80
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:58,701
Just think what madness it is,
what you're doing.

81
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,974
What could
possibly happen to you?

82
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,581
I won't kick the bucket
in a POW camp.

83
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,649
I've had enough.
I can't go on.

84
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,652
But I showed you the newspaper,
and you heard it on the radio.

85
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,950
Ex-military don't have
to turn themselves in now.

86
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,094
You just have to register
with the police, like everyone else.

87
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:19,425
And when they find out
I fought to the very end

88
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,032
and what regiment I was in,

89
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,225
you think they'll let me go?

90
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,894
That was war.
You were doing your duty as a soldier.

91
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,836
They can't hold that against you.

92
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,772
Easy for you to say.
It's not your life on the line.

93
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,142
Papa, you have no idea.
You haven't been out there.

94
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,873
It's just logic.

95
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,711
Has anyone caused us
any trouble up to now?

96
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,117
Fine! If you'll take
the responsibility,

97
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,416
I'll turn myself in right now.

98
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,923
No, Karl-Heinz!

99
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,421
Stay here.

100
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,393
I'll find something,
and so will Eva.

101
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,362
Just give us a little time.

102
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,469
Of course, Edmund.
We'll manage somehow.

103
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,537
I have to go see
Mr. Rademacher.

104
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,866
He has something for me.
I'll be right back.

105
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,168
It's always worked out so far.

106
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,278
Father, you'll be
more comfy like this.

107
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,415
You and I have to talk.
- Fine.

108
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,074
But not here.
Come to my room.

109
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,015
So that person sees me, right?

110
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,348
- She's harmless.
- Harmless!

111
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,787
Sure, the so-called
"victims of Fascism."

112
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,484
Then come to the bathroom.
No one will see us there.

113
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,026
See if anyone's out there.

114
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,759
No, there's no one there.

115
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,560
Come on.

116
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,545
I've kept my mouth shut

117
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,476
because I didn't want to quarrel
in Father's presence.

118
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,617
You know his condition.
We mustn't get agitated.

119
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,879
I didn't start anything.
I'm happy to be left alone.

120
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,750
- Because you're a coward.
- Maybe.

121
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,686
And horribly selfish.

122
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,785
You don't care where the food
comes from, as long as it's there.

123
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,896
I didn't make Edmund go to work.

124
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,998
No, you don't make
anyone do anything,

125
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,498
and yet here you are,
hungry and thirsty.

126
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,967
You don't care where I go at night
as long as I bring home cigarettes.

127
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,662
Do I smoke them?

128
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,332
No, but you know they provide
the bare necessities.

129
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,536
Should I admire you for that?
All the girls do that these days.

130
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,579
- And more.
- You see?

131
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,274
You want me to become
a whore for you?

132
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,248
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

133
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,184
We're both on edge.

134
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,825
But just look at our situation.

135
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,190
We get more desperate every day.
- You needn't tell me.

136
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,297
We just can't let Edmund -

137
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,559
I know that.
Don't you think I worry about it?

138
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,033
But all of you only think
about yourselves.

139
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,332
You've forgotten
what I went through all those years.

140
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,804
You're wrong.

141
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,409
We know that you almost
died of thirst near Tobruk

142
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,341
and nearly
froze to death in Russia.

143
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,141
I don't want to suffer anymore.
I'd rather end it all.

144
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,783
No, Karl-Heinz.

145
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:55,352
You survived it all,
and you'll go on living.

146
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,519
Here you are, Gina.
Come along.

147
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,250
Mommy, I want to stay here.

148
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,156
Your girl's no bother.

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,594
- You're working in this light?
- We must save electricity.

150
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,132
Not when you really need it.

151
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,828
Can I give you a hand?

152
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,335
Thanks, I'm fine.

153
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,736
- You're suspicious of me too.
- No.

154
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,274
- But the others are, aren't they?
- I think so.

155
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,911
Why?

156
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,809
Because I was abroad
for so long?

157
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,076
- No, because of your political views.
- That's ridiculous.

158
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:30,052
The Rademachers hate me
because I'm taking up a room.

159
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:34,090
- Are we moving again?
- No. Now be quiet.

160
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,720
You room with Miss Kohler.
They're nice, simple people.

161
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,196
What have they got against me?

162
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,961
I'm sure it's because their son -

163
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,299
Come on, Gina.

164
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,463
I'll pick out some linens for you.

165
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,201
You can make
diapers out of them.

166
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,272
She's always very helpful.

167
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,313
I don't believe
in help from strangers.

168
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,111
Everyone has to help
themselves these days.

169
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,811
I'm very understanding, my boy.
I'm no monster.

170
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,354
But there's a limit.
I've told you that before.

171
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,119
I didn't know what kind
of help you were offering.

172
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,363
Can't I get something for you?

173
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,055
You know I hate the black market.

174
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,495
Or swap something?

175
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,966
That's what the official
Exchange Office is for.

176
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,265
They swindle us every time.
Give him the scale.

177
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,637
My scale?
How will I check my weight?

178
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,973
It's not the first thing we've had
to sacrifice, my dear.

179
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,809
Go get the scale.
- All right.

180
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,378
How much should I ask for it?

181
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,817
- What can we get for it, Mother?
- I'd think 200 marks.

182
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,980
Far too little. At least 300.

183
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,989
Exactly the price
of a pound of butter.

184
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,821
<i>Edmund- Oh, pardon me.</i>

185
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,862
Your food's getting cold.
Hurry. I still want to go out.

186
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,158
- I'll be right there.
- Excuse me.

187
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,495
Miss Rademacher...

188
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,534
may I please see the scale?

189
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:57,836
It's an outrage!
That woman has no shame!

190
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,171
Just like that hussy Blanke.

191
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,747
To think our daughter
has to mix with such people.

192
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,009
A typical sign of the times.

193
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,450
What have you got against my sister?
Why are you always groaning about us?

194
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,987
Be quiet.

195
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,991
Take the scale, and don't come back
with less than 300 marks.

196
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,924
Got that?

197
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,394
Yes, Mr. Rademacher.
I'll come for it tomorrow.

198
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,877
- Eva?
<i>- What is it?</i>

199
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,883
Where are you going?

200
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,716
- Out.
- Why are you going out?

201
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,385
- I go out every night.
- Why?

202
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,256
To take my mind off things.

203
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,296
- Ready to go?
- I'm coming.

204
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,660
They won't wait for us, you know.

205
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,329
Yes, I know.

206
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,964
I don't want you
to go out every night.

207
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,603
What's gotten into you
all of a sudden?

208
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,106
What are you thinking?

209
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,041
Come, my child.

210
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,346
Look me in the eye.

211
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,684
Now go to bed...

212
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,192
and don't worry about a thing.

213
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,249
- Cigarette, mademoiselle?
- Thank you.

214
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,045
<i>Garcon,</i> two cognacs.

215
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,252
- <i>Merci.</i> Not right now. Later.
- All right.

216
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,817
Jean, still in Berlin?

217
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,292
That's right, my friend.
Excuse me a moment?

218
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,199
He's nice, your Frenchman.

219
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,765
Yes, very nice.

220
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,496
You'd better hurry
and seize this opportunity.

221
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,163
I'm fine just enjoying
myself a bit.

222
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:45,868
I don't think you understand
how to really handle men.

223
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,139
- I can't do it.
- Don't be so stupid, child.

224
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,011
You might catch one for keeps.

225
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,176
I told you, I can't do it.
I'm just too stupid.

226
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,219
Having a good time?

227
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,248
Come to the Bavarina with us?

228
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,983
I'll walk with you a ways,

229
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,752
but then I'm going home.

230
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,674
Young people
just don't feel like working.

231
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,173
All they think about
is the black market.

232
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,471
- You know the Lehmann boy?
- Working in construction?

233
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,739
"Working"?
If you ask what he's doing,

234
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,247
he says, "I don't know.
I start tomorrow."

235
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,745
Hurry, Hilde.
There'll be nothing left.

236
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,285
A few grams won't matter.

237
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,480
But if there's nothing at home -

238
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,716
Hey, get in line!

239
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,864
It's getting harder and harder
with three hungry men in the house.

240
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,522
I don't know what to make.

241
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,964
Butter was 200 marks
a pound yesterday.

242
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,867
My father's pension is 70 marks
a month, if he even gets it.

243
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,668
And you go out
for four or five cigarettes.

244
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,140
It's 20 marks.

245
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,711
What can you buy for that?
Five pounds of potatoes.

246
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,541
You're crazy. Trust me.

247
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,809
Maybe, but don't you see?
I just can't help it.

248
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,510
- Because of Helmut?
- Yes.

249
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:07,221
Don't you think he understands
your situation, like all POWs?

250
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,418
He won't be back for a long time.

251
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,187
He'll certainly understand.

252
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,627
It's not about understanding.

253
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,734
The two of us -
How can I explain?

254
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,029
At first it was just
some innocent postcards.

255
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,766
Then I heard nothing
for a long time,

256
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,431
until suddenly a letter came

257
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,805
from the POW camp.

258
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,513
He wrote to me
because he had no one else,

259
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,241
and he had to write to someone.

260
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,914
He had nothing to hold on to

261
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,685
except me.

262
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,380
You understand?

263
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,716
He lives
just waiting for my letters,

264
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,124
and I have someone
I can turn to too.

265
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,230
But you have your family.

266
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,195
- I do what I can for them.
- It's not very much.

267
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,893
I know, but I don't have
the courage to do more.

268
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,971
You must find the courage
to do anything.

269
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:58,098
And after 10 shots of schnapps,
you do, believe me.

270
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,471
Why are you hanging
around here?

271
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:05,048
Leave me alone, will you?

272
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,824
Hey, kids,
what's going on here?

273
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,922
How much for the scale?
- Three hundred marks.

274
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,058
For that chunk of rust?
Are you crazy?

275
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:27,967
That chunk of rust works just fine.
Get on and weigh yourself.

276
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,233
Really? Fine, then.

277
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,644
I'll give you something good for it.

278
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:36,247
Take it easy.
I'm not running off with it.

279
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,445
Just wait a minute.

280
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,324
I'll give you this.
- What is it?

281
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,325
- Top-quality canned meat.
- That's all?

282
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,330
Stop your screeching.
I'll throw in another can.

283
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,901
I'm in a generous mood.
Now get lost.

284
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,005
- That's not enough. I need more!
- Shut your trap.

285
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,411
You're such a dumb ass!

286
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,630
Hello.

287
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:38,139
- You were in my class once.
- Yes, Mr. Henning.

288
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,369
See, I have a good memory.

289
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,878
What's your name again?

290
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,814
Edmund Kohler.

291
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,679
That's right.
Edmund Kohler.

292
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,118
You've grown up to be a handsome,
strapping young man.

293
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,553
How's your father doing?

294
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,024
My father's very sick.

295
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,356
I see.

296
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,725
You have
a big brother too, right?

297
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,727
Yes, he was in the war.
Now he's at home.

298
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,302
So he's unemployed, just like me.

299
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,065
- Aren't you a teacher anymore?
- No.

300
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,170
The authorities and I
didn't see eye to eye

301
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,938
about educating today's youth.

302
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:20,344
Tell me, my young Edmund,
what are you doing here anyway?

303
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,009
Nothing much.

304
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,781
- Keep me company for a while.
- I'd love to.

305
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,358
I'm always happy to see
a former pupil again.

306
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,565
Hey, Henning.

307
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,902
You didn't even recognize me.
- Sure I did.

308
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,046
Dirty work, eh?
- Work? Slavery.

309
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,181
A fine situation we're in.

310
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,945
Before, we were still men.
National Socialists.

311
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,144
Now we're just Nazis.

312
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,953
The streetcar's coming.

313
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,648
- All the best.
- See you.

314
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,376
All clear.

315
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,601
- Did you have to shovel too?
- You bet. To clear up the rubble.

316
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,146
- And work on the rooftops too?
- That too.

317
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,807
My brother was supposed to too,
but he didn't register.

318
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,512
Unfortunately they caught me,
but I got on the sick list.

319
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,419
Remember how I scolded your dad
for that fake certificate

320
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:09,856
when he tried to keep you
out of the Hitler Youth?

321
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,553
You were very honest
and didn't tell me any fibs.

322
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,098
I should have taken stronger measures,
but I didn't, for your sake.

323
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,826
Here we are.

324
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,903
- Have you always lived here?
- No.

325
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,505
- You just moved?
- Yes, a good friend took me in.

326
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,864
- Ah, there you are.
- Hello, ma'am.

327
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,733
- Well, did you go?
- Yes.

328
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,601
- Nice kid. Who is he?
- One of my former students.

329
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,801
A fine boy.
Did you tell them we sent you?

330
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,309
- Sure.
- And?

331
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,176
I have to go back tomorrow.
Then we'll probably get the stamp.

332
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,374
Did you bring my nail polish?

333
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,009
Of course.
I hope it's the right color.

334
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,688
Excellent. Take a look.

335
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,087
Now, if you'II...

336
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,322
- Good-bye.
- See you later, my boy.

337
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,399
- You like this color?
- Much too showy.

338
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,662
What would you know
about women's things?

339
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,669
Hello.

340
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,537
- Nice kid. Never seen him before.
- Former student.

341
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,607
Is he around?
- Out on the terrace.

342
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,089
Come on.

343
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,029
Come on in, my boy.
Give me your bag.

344
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,966
We'll put it right here.

345
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,332
Now tell me.

346
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,600
What have you got to tell me?
- Nothing.

347
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,403
Sit down.

348
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,878
What are they teaching you about
in school now? Democracy?

349
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,142
I can't really say.
I'm not going right now.

350
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,287
Don't you like your new teachers?

351
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,253
- Sure, but I have to work.
- Why?

352
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,154
There are four of us
and just three ration cards.

353
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,295
Poor boy.

354
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,328
Right, because your brother
didn't register.

355
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,398
Yes, he's in hiding.

356
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,593
And he fought to the very end,
right to the corner of our street.

357
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,761
Don't worry.
We'll find a solution.

358
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,429
I've tried everything.

359
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,667
Today I went for a work permit,

360
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,041
and then I went to work
at the cemetery,

361
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,375
but they threw me out again.

362
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,920
- So you're back, young man?
- Yes, Mr. Von Laubnitz.

363
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,784
This is a former student of mine.

364
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,421
- Did you get anywhere?
- I think tomorrow.

365
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,656
- So it's still not decided?
- No.

366
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,133
- The matter has to be settled.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:16,146
Listen, my dear little Edmund,

368
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,145
I'd really like to help you.

369
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:20,716
But you must promise
not to tell anyone.

370
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:22,444
Understand?

371
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,818
It's nothing really,
but I don't want to attract attention.

372
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,218
I'll give you something
you can sell,

373
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,554
but you must say it's yours,
if anyone asks.

374
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,663
Even in this building, okay?
- Yes, sir.

375
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,823
Go to the chancellery,
understand?

376
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,493
You'll find a bunch of Yanks
or Limeys or other idiots there

377
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,231
that you can palm
this record off on.

378
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:44,270
Get your bag.

379
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,277
It's a speech by Hitler.

380
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,474
Take the record player along too.

381
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,183
You can just say
I lent it to you.

382
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,054
Prove to me
you're a smart boy, all right?

383
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,694
- And what did you get?
- Nothing.

384
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,763
Matches your looks, you idiot.

385
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,457
- And how'd you fare?
- Me? Great.

386
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:11,192
See you tonight, right?

387
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,735
- Jo and Christl, come here.
- What is it?

388
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,999
Take this little guy
to the chancellery.

389
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,938
He's got something to sell.

390
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,374
Make sure he does it right.
He's just a beginner.

391
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,071
- You can count on us.
- Go with them, okay?

392
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,345
When I grow up,
I'm gonna buy a car.

393
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,318
- I can't wait that long.
<i>- Edmund.</i>

394
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,752
Wait here a minute.

395
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,754
Edmund, come quickly.
Hurry.

396
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,398
Here he is.

397
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:53,229
Yes, you can listen to it.
Hurry up.

398
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,806
- I'm not an express train.
- Don't be such a slowpoke.

399
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:06,379
<i>... hold the flag high when</i>
<i>the storm rages and thunder strikes.</i>

400
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:09,019
<i>I am proud to be</i>
<i>the leader of this nation,</i>

401
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,451
<i>not only in happy times,</i>
<i>but especially in hard ones.</i>

402
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,955
<i>I'm happy that in such times</i>
<i>I can once again</i>

403
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,151
<i>give my strength and trust</i>
<i>to the nation,</i>

404
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,889
<i>that I can and must raise up</i>
<i>the entire German people</i>

405
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:25,696
<i>and tell them, "German people,</i>
<i>set your hearts at rest!</i>

406
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,430
<i>We shall overcome!</i>
<i>Victory awaits us in the end!"</i>

407
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,188
Kids! What a coincidence!

408
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,188
Where have you been?
- At the chancellery.

409
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:49,258
- So it all worked out?
- Yes, sir.

410
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,123
- How much did you get?
- Two hundred marks.

411
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,265
- Where are they?
- Here.

412
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,167
Here are 10 marks for you.

413
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,337
See?
I take good care of you.

414
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,000
Come see me again soon, okay?

415
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,645
Bye.

416
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,048
- Jo!
- Come on.

417
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,420
Wait here a minute.

418
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,858
- Why do we have to wait?
- Jo's pulling off a job.

419
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,327
- What job?
- Don't ask such stupid questions.

420
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,729
If you're so curious,
go after him.

421
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:31,232
I will.

422
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,530
Jo!

423
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,528
I told you to wait outside.

424
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,860
What are you doing
down here?

425
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:06,003
- Selling something.
- What?

426
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,604
- This.
- What is it?

427
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,034
Soap.

428
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,437
Soap?
That's why I had to -

429
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,711
Pipe down. You'll see
what you can do with soap.

430
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,939
Now beat it.
You too, silly goose.

431
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:29,189
<i>Zoologischer Garten!</i>
<i>This stop Zoologischer Garten!</i>

432
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,922
- Fifty marks.
- I don't have it.

433
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,964
Just take a look.

434
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,466
- Smell.
- Nice, but too expensive.

435
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,698
For you I'll make it 40.

436
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,464
Come on. Hurry up.

437
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:21,107
Now you see how
to soap the people up?

438
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:28,542
No one here?
The gang was supposed to be here.

439
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,883
Wait for me.
I'll see where Ali Baba's hiding.

440
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,392
- Is he your brother?
- Jo? No.

441
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,993
Don't you live together?

442
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,651
Us? Live together?

443
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,025
I thought you lived together.

444
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,759
We don't live together.
Hey, Jo!

445
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,571
- Hey, sweetie!
- Hands off!

446
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,967
Don't be that way!

447
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,507
- Conceited princess.
- A mattress that dispenses cigarettes.

448
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,804
She's not the only broad
I've been with.

449
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,413
A trainload of potatoes
is coming in tonight.

450
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,050
Crazy!
We'll get ourselves some.

451
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:01,810
The cops will be there too.

452
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,175
- Jo?
- I know where to find him.

453
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,846
- Hey, Jo.
- What?

454
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,048
Will you sell me
a piece of soap?

455
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,159
- Why not?
- How much you want?

456
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,555
Forty smackers.

457
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,197
Forty? I only have 10.

458
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,299
You'll get the rest
tomorrow and the day after.

459
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,866
All right.

460
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,366
Good.

461
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:30,334
- Now put it away.
- I want to take a look first.

462
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,136
You dirty dog,
you cheated me!

463
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,449
Good night and sweet dreams.

464
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,208
Where are you going?

465
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,353
I have a rendezvous.

466
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,421
- Where are we anyway?
- Good question.

467
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,621
I live near the Alexanderplatz.
How do I get home?

468
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,387
No one's making you go home.

469
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,829
- Where am I supposed to sleep?
- Right here. There's plenty of room.

470
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,729
Alone?

471
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,368
With her.
Or don't you like her?

472
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,733
Afraid of girls?
- It's not that.

473
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,808
She's a nice girl,
you dummkopf.

474
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,604
Now get lost, you two.

475
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:14,115
You gonna keep
all those potatoes yourself?

476
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:17,686
You can have a few.
Where should I put them?

477
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,379
In here.

478
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,360
That's all?

479
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,396
Where would you put more?

480
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,658
In my bag.

481
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,496
I'll give you more tomorrow.
I promise.

482
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,537
Now good night,
and make each other happy.

483
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,537
You'll see.
It's lots of fun.

484
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,606
Come on.

485
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,142
Jo, listen!

486
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,042
Let him be. Come on.

487
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,254
They're gonna really
hit the roof, my boy.

488
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,760
You think so?

489
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,459
Staying out all night
won't go unpunished.

490
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,628
- What should I do?
- You'll have to pay the piper.

491
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,107
I only stayed out
all night because -

492
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:16,212
You needn't tell me.
Explain it to your sister.

493
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,006
Come on.

494
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,258
Edmund! Finally!

495
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,731
I thought you weren't coming home.

496
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,767
You gave me such a fright.

497
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,497
You're a horrible boy.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

498
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:46,074
Nothing. It's just Edmund.
Go back to sleep.

499
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,542
To your room - march!

500
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,075
Where were you the whole night?

501
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,653
I didn't do anything bad,
Eva, honest.

502
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,156
I want to know where you were.

503
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,689
I was getting potatoes.

504
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,827
That's no reason
to stay out all night.

505
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,895
Tomorrow I'll get more.

506
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,462
Look.

507
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,602
Father's awake.

508
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,568
Hear how he's coughing?

509
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,833
He was very ill last night.

510
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,239
- Does he know?
- Yes.

511
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,004
Yes, Father.

512
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,075
Edmund's here.

513
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,153
<i>Come here.</i>

514
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,057
Closer.

515
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,425
It's not my fault.
The other boys made me -

516
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,531
Save your breath.
I'm not interested in your lies.

517
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,863
You should be ashamed -
so depraved and corrupted at your age!

518
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,164
He didn't mean any harm, Father.

519
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,864
He was finding us some food.
- I won't eat any of it.

520
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:54,140
Me neither.
I'd rather starve.

521
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,675
Easy to say.

522
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:59,247
I'm tired of lying around,
of no use to anyone.

523
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,880
Don't get upset.
I'm sure he won't do it again.

524
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,614
Show how many
potatoes you brought.

525
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,924
And canned meat.

526
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,083
That's not for us.

527
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,593
- Who's it for?
- Mr. Rademacher.

528
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,161
Well? Any luck?

529
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,636
- It's not so easy.
- The main cable has to be in there.

530
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,741
Yes, but it's hard to get at.

531
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,434
And the power company might easily
notice we're tapping it.

532
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,170
No need to worry.

533
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,872
With five households,
it could have been any one of us.

534
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:33,880
- Here, Mr. Rademacher.
- What do you want?

535
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,076
- I brought canned meat.
- I didn't order any.

536
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,779
- For the scale.
- Where are the 300 marks?

537
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,753
This is all I got for it.

538
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,985
What? You dare bring me this
for my expensive scale?

539
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,322
Canned meat?
You want to poison us all?

540
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,829
- It's not bad.
- Then you take it...

541
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,262
Very kind of you.

542
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,265
...to my wife.

543
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:56,704
Out with the truth.
Where's the money?

544
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:57,966
What money?

545
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,905
For the scale.
I bet it's in your pocket.

546
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:02,477
- How can you accuse me of that?
- It's perfectly clear.

547
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,810
You're all dying of hunger
and trying to get by at any cost.

548
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,746
First you forced yourself on us.

549
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,579
That was the housing authority.

550
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:11,415
I'm the one who has to bear it.

551
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,250
We all have to put up

552
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,949
with your father's constant
bellyaching and whimpering.

553
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,824
Why doesn't he just croak?
We'd finally have some peace.

554
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,976
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

555
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,807
Wait. I'll help you.

556
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,040
Thank you, child.

557
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,692
- Your soup is on the stove.
- Close the door.

558
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,290
Want some?

559
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,697
No, you eat it. Eva warmed it up
especially for you.

560
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,734
How about
an American cigarette?

561
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,770
So Eva can hold it over me?

562
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,703
It's not from Eva.

563
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,536
Don't tell me you bought it.

564
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,303
No, it was a present.

565
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,674
From the boys
you were running around with?

566
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,339
It wasn't the boys.
It was a girl.

567
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,276
- You should be ashamed!
- Everyone else does it.

568
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,319
That's no excuse.

569
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,423
Her name's Christl.
She lost her parents.

570
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,525
She lives in a basement.

571
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,823
She laughed at me
because I don't smoke yet.

572
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,727
She often brings cigarettes
for the other guys.

573
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,099
You should have someone
who'd look after you.

574
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,205
Me? I don't need anyone.

575
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,235
I've had enough of this rotten life.

576
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,241
You mustn't lose courage now.

577
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,902
No, I mustn't.

578
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,480
A soldier can lose everything
but his courage.

579
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,549
But I'm not a soldier anymore.

580
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,745
Now I'm a nobody.
One more mouth to feed.

581
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,890
I swear I'd like to jump
out the window.

582
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,650
<i>Come quickly!</i>

583
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,719
Come quickly.

584
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,289
Father had another attack.

585
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,301
I think we should call a doctor.
You hear me?

586
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,700
Yes, but -

587
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:12,172
I'll get him.
I know where he lives.

588
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,120
Don't worry.
It's nothing serious.

589
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,327
His heart is very weak,

590
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:38,195
but it's his poor overall condition
that most concerns me.

591
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,802
What should we do?

592
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,804
He needs nourishing food,
with fats and vitamins.

593
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,943
- How can we get that?
- We only have a Level 3 card.

594
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,875
I know. It's the same
sorry state everywhere.

595
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,107
It would be best
to get him to a hospital,

596
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,445
but they're all full to overflowing.

597
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,053
You think there's any possibility?

598
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:02,090
They've turned away
worse cases,

599
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:06,393
but fortunately I have very good
connections at the Health Department.

600
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,089
Hear that, Father?
You're going to the hospital.

601
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,063
You can eat all you want there.

602
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,362
Three meals a day.

603
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:14,765
Wait just a minute.

604
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,874
I can't make any promises,

605
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,239
but I'd be surprised
if I can't manage it.

606
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,744
Get well soon. Good-bye.

607
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,417
Happy now, Daddy?

608
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,827
- So you feel better?
- Much better.

609
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,463
Not so loud, Father.

610
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,258
Remember what the doctor said.

611
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,526
You're right.
Someone might hear us.

612
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,227
But you simply can't imagine.

613
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,032
- What?
- All I've had to eat.

614
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:51,697
First soup,

615
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,312
then meat with fresh vegetables,

616
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,606
and this much milk.

617
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:59,908
- Really?
- What do you think of that?

618
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,075
I'm happy you have it so good.

619
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,312
And in the evening
there's another hot meal.

620
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,479
You'll see how quickly
you get better.

621
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,683
Yes. But when I think
of all of you -

622
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,657
Don't worry about us.

623
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,821
As long as you feel better,
that's a comfort for us.

624
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,900
It makes things a little easier,
doesn't it?

625
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,229
- Yes, Father.
- That's what I tell myself too.

626
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,271
- You think Eva's still coming?
- Definitely. She just went to the hospital.

627
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,305
- Mind if I smoke?
- Go right ahead.

628
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,309
- Join me?
- Thanks, I just had one.

629
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:33,245
I'll get you a light.

630
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,485
Where are the matches?
- We don't have any more.

631
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,453
- Go get some.
- With no money?

632
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,216
- Go ask Rademacher -
- No need.

633
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,726
My friend has some.
I have to go see her anyway.

634
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,623
Oh, here you are.
- What is it?

635
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,663
I'll tell you later.
I'm going to Hilde's.

636
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:50,925
All right.

637
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,966
- How's Father?
- He's doing better.

638
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,229
And we're doing worse.

639
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,431
- They cut off the power.
- How can that be?

640
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:01,269
They found out someone here
was plugging in for free.

641
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:03,379
- Rademacher suspected us.
- Of course.

642
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,014
That's why he's yelling.

643
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,117
That swindler!
Someone ought to shut his trap.

644
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:10,116
Lots of big words,

645
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,380
but you just sit around
while everything happens to us.

646
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:13,887
You starting that again?

647
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,650
You must have done
something wrong.

648
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,420
- I only did my duty.
- Then you have nothing to fear.

649
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,325
I asked about it again yesterday.

650
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:23,466
- With that refugee woman?
- No, with an Allied officer.

651
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,034
Your moral guides -
Allied officers.

652
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,171
Our troubles
don't even bother you.

653
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,365
For a while at least
Father's been in the hospital.

654
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,067
But he comes back tomorrow,
and we have nothing in the house.

655
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,872
I'll find something.
Now I know how.

656
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,480
And that's fine with you?

657
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:42,380
Let Edmund do the dirty work
and get more and more corrupted?

658
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,180
Leave me alone.

659
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,883
Go dancing with your Yanks.

660
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,988
Mr. Henning!

661
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,162
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Could I speak with you?

662
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,326
Sure. Come back later
or tomorrow.

663
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,436
Listen...

664
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,630
Can't you see I'm busy?

665
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,502
It's about my father.

666
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:08,042
- Okay, tell me.
- Come with me.

667
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,910
Wait here a minute, okay?

668
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,649
What is it?

669
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,011
My father comes home
from the hospital tomorrow.

670
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,243
And?

671
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,186
We have nothing in the house -
no bread, jam, margarine.

672
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:22,985
It's all my brother's fault.

673
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,094
What am I supposed to do?

674
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:27,321
We have to get him
something to eat.

675
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,092
Can't you help?
Tell me what I should do.

676
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,064
I have no idea, my boy.

677
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,170
You have to accept things
as they come.

678
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,533
He's old and weak.
You've tried everything.

679
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,436
You can't fight destiny.

680
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,543
- What if he dies?
- Then he dies.

681
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,611
We all have to die
sooner or later.

682
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,977
You can't all starve
just to keep him alive.

683
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,447
Mr. Von Laubnitz.

684
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,087
- Another of your students?
- No, a little friend.

685
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,191
Come along, my boy.
I have something for you.

686
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,733
I hope you understood.

687
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:07,962
Stop this now.
You can't change things.

688
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,570
Everything isn't about you
and your selfishness.

689
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,005
Afraid that Daddy will die!

690
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,575
Look at nature.

691
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,043
The weak are destroyed
so that the strong survive.

692
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,512
One must have the courage
to let the weak die.

693
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,117
You have to be clear
about that, my boy.

694
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,214
It's all about saving ourselves.

695
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,721
So chin up, okay?

696
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,756
Think about your brother.

697
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,451
Bye.

698
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,522
Father.

699
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,233
Come, my boy. Sit down.

700
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,896
Come closer.

701
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,668
Give me a kiss.

702
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:20,075
It's so nice of you
to come visit me.

703
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,607
Four days here
have done wonders for me,

704
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,875
and it was easier
on you at home too.

705
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,642
Father, you know -

706
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:31,982
Let's see how
your temperature is today.

707
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:35,489
Is the little one your son?
- Yes, my youngest.

708
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,687
A nice boy.

709
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,756
Sit down.
You're not in my way.

710
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:44,061
Now I'll be a burden
on all of you again.

711
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,725
That's the worst part.

712
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,429
It would be better if I were dead.

713
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,139
I've often thought

714
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,139
I ought to end my life,
POISON

715
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:56,376
but I lack the courage.

716
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,414
My existence is nothing but agony.

717
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,676
I know it full well.

718
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,746
For me...

719
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,611
and for all of you.

720
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,586
Here, Father.

721
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:17,064
We can eat now.
- Shall we move the table?

722
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,201
Yes.

723
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,063
Grab that end, Edmund.

724
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,073
A little further?

725
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,445
Wait, Father. I'll help you.

726
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,190
Just potatoes?

727
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,224
I couldn't make you any soup.

728
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,192
Why not?
The gas hasn't been shut off, has it?

729
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,299
No, but we have
no more flour or oil.

730
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,697
At least a little tea.

731
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,701
That's all gone too.

732
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:59,837
My God, why didn't I
just stay in the hospital?

733
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:05,347
Now I have to lie around here
and be a burden to you again.

734
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:10,680
The misery of watching
and not being able to help.

735
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,513
Condemned to live.

736
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,389
Lord...

737
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,696
why don't you just let me die?

738
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:21,922
Don't talk like that, Father.

739
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:24,761
It would be a relief...

740
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,033
for me and all of you.

741
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,297
We'll manage.

742
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,904
If only Karl-Heinz had registered.

743
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:39,607
I thought my absence would
make him aware of his responsibility.

744
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:44,243
What would have happened
if I hadn't come back or I'd died?

745
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,089
Can you tell me that,
Karl-Heinz?

746
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:51,284
Or would you leave Eva and Edmund
to face their fate alone?

747
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:52,723
Of course not.

748
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:56,457
If only your mother were still alive,

749
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,897
but she was taken from me too.

750
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,060
Everything's been taken from me.

751
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,798
My life savings by inflation...

752
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,837
my sons by Hitler.

753
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:09,637
I should have rebelled against it,

754
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:14,375
but I was too weak,
like so many of my generation.

755
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,854
We saw disaster coming
and did nothing to prevent it.

756
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,718
Only now do we see
the consequences.

757
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,383
Now we're paying for our mistakes.

758
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,826
All of us,
me just as much as you.

759
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,627
We just have
to acknowledge our guilt.

760
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,169
Just complaining
accomplishes nothing.

761
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,964
Yes, I know, Father.

762
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,940
My days are numbered,
but you're still young.

763
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,340
You can still set
a lot of things right.

764
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,846
Prove you're a man.

765
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,952
Have the courage to register.

766
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,720
You'll see how much easier
it makes life

767
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,291
for you and your family.

768
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,119
Eva and Edmund will be grateful.

769
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,630
And I'll be proud too,

770
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,495
my son.

771
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,772
You'll give me new courage to live.

772
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,108
You'll work.

773
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:16,405
You'll get a ration card
like everyone else.

774
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,914
So stop putting it off.

775
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,415
Stop living like a hunted animal.

776
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:28,023
Try to be a man again
who can show his face anywhere.

777
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,788
There's no shame
in accepting one's fate.

778
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:37,559
You know I was an officer
in World War I.

779
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:43,262
You think it was just child's play,
but it was plenty for me.

780
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:46,940
Back then too we marched
along to waving flags,

781
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,135
conquered half of Europe,

782
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:51,610
and got all the way to Russia.

783
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:55,183
It seemed like no power
in the world could oppose us.

784
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,287
Then suddenly the end came.

785
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,048
First defeat...

786
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,317
then revolution.

787
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,488
I wept

788
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:09,456
when they tore off my epaulets.

789
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,260
No one can accuse me
of not being a good German.

790
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:18,666
But during all these difficult years,
I longed for just one thing,

791
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,407
and I can confess it to you now:

792
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,308
The collapse of the Third Reich

793
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,881
and defeat.

794
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,918
I don't want to know
how the world would look

795
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,921
if things had turned out otherwise.

796
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,748
Here, Father.

797
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,161
Tea?

798
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,888
Edmund got it for you.

799
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,396
Tastes odd.

800
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:55,076
But it's warm,
and that does a man good.

801
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:59,841
You want some, Karl-Heinz?

802
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:02,712
No, I got it specially for you.

803
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,722
You're a good boy.

804
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,682
Thank you.

805
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,692
All three of you
are so good to me.

806
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,988
I can be proud
to have children like you.

807
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,064
Misfortune has befallen us,

808
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:25,265
but it has brought
my children back to me.

809
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,077
Come in.

810
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,713
It's a raid. The police
are searching door to door.

811
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,872
- Good heavens!
- You have to hide.

812
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,983
I'm not hiding anymore.

813
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,434
<i>Open up. Police.</i>

814
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,167
Take it easy.

815
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,040
We have to search the building.

816
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,082
Everything's in order here.

817
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,647
No need to make trouble.

818
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,917
I don't have papers.

819
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,752
Take care of this man.

820
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,521
No papers?
Where are they?

821
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,323
I burned my documents.

822
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,261
Then you must come
to the station.

823
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,493
- May I let my family know?
- Yes, but I must go with you.

824
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,967
Go ahead.

825
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:42,411
- It's the rooms behind the kitchen.
- Go ahead, and hurry.

826
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,845
- The power's off.
- Who's the head tenant here?

827
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,615
- I am.
- It's our apartment.

828
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,761
- Who else lives here?
- Just some noisy broads.

829
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:53,452
- Your occupation?
- Artist.

830
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,097
Yeah, a freeload artist.

831
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,563
In there's a refugee woman
with her child.

832
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,294
- And next to them?
- A very pregnant young woman.

833
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,461
Her husband's in a POW camp.

834
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,540
- We can go.
- Karl-Heinz, stay here.

835
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,336
He didn't do anything.

836
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,343
Then we won't do anything to him.
Come along.

837
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,976
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to me.

838
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,966
It's my father! Help me!

839
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,438
My father!

840
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,168
What are you screaming about?

841
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,836
My father! He's not moving.

842
00:54:45,348 --> 00:54:47,282
I'm afraid he might be dead.

843
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,213
I'm so afraid.

844
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,016
The old man's dead,
no doubt about it.

845
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:59,093
Don't be upset, Eva.

846
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,696
In his condition,
it's all for the best.

847
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:04,595
And just now,
when Karl-Heinz isn't here.

848
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,464
Come. It's better
if you don't stay here.

849
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,502
Has anyone called a doctor?

850
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,265
A doctor can't help him now.

851
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,635
All we can do
is arrange for a quick burial.

852
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,643
- A coffin will cost a bundle.
- There's always a paper sack.

853
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:20,112
That's awful.
I don't want to be buried like that.

854
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,511
Don't talk such nonsense.

855
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,619
This doesn't concern you.
Go to your room.

856
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,755
Coffin or no coffin?

857
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,686
The main thing is to get
the body out of here.

858
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:30,849
Best to put it out on the terrace.

859
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,495
Maybe he had
a contagious disease.

860
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:36,655
Don't worry. He starved to death.
That's not contagious.

861
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,664
Let's get him outside.

862
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,297
<i>Let's get him outside.</i>

863
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,702
<i>- I'll get his head.</i>
<i>- Good. I've got his legs.</i>

864
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,535
<i>- Mother, lead the way with the light.</i>
<i>- Here we go.</i>

865
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,720
Lucky he's not too heavy.

866
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,282
My poor boy.

867
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,054
Wait.

868
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,034
That should do it.

869
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,106
- What'll happen to his things?
- Good question.

870
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,799
His old torn pajamas
aren't worth anything.

871
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,605
What about the sweater
and woolen socks?

872
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,940
These?

873
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,462
<i>Keep moving.</i>

874
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,134
- I'm back.
- Karl-Heinz!

875
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,340
What is it?
Why are you crying?

876
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,075
- Father's dead.
- Dead?

877
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,786
And all I thought about

878
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:11,120
was how happy he'd be
to know I was free.

879
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,929
You made his wish come true.
That's the main thing.

880
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,588
Come.

881
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,698
No, this way.

882
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,878
Poor boy.

883
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:41,217
- Is he free now?
- Yes, completely free.

884
00:57:41,691 --> 00:57:44,717
I took care of everything.
The coffin's been ordered.

885
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,121
It will probably come next week.
It just depends.

886
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,132
- You can't stay here.
- Where can we go?

887
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,100
My place. I have room.
For you too.

888
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:58,172
- Edmund, pack your things.
- I'm not going with you.

889
00:57:58,341 --> 00:57:59,968
You can't stay here all alone.

890
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,168
There's plenty of room
for me to sleep here.

891
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:05,314
- Who'll take care of you?
- Let me worry about that.

892
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,507
You seem to forget
you're just a little boy.

893
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:11,313
You should have said so earlier, before
I pounded the pavement for all of you.

894
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,614
Edmund!

895
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,814
Leave him alone.
He'll come to his senses.

896
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,022
<i>Damn crater!</i>

897
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,159
I told you to watch your step.

898
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,318
Come on.
I'll show you the way.

899
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,158
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

900
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,320
<i>It's awfully close to necrophilia.</i>

901
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,088
You must have been dropped
on your head as a baby!

902
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,562
The buds smell
like a cemetery.

903
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,132
But they're easy to roll.

904
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:08,327
Man, you just fell
off the turnip truck.

905
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,937
Hash brown potatoes.

906
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:13,034
Christl!

907
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:14,642
What is it?

908
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,345
Get outta here.

909
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,850
Looks like you
picked up another trick.

910
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,547
I don't hang around with infants.

911
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,610
Mr. Henning.

912
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,750
- What is it, my boy?
- Can I talk to you for a moment?

913
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,622
Of course. Come up.

914
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,133
Come in.

915
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,965
Mr. Henning,
I have to talk to you.

916
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:00,166
What is it?
You're so pale. What's wrong?

917
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,207
Come sit down.

918
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,014
Now tell me what's wrong.

919
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,413
- I did it.
- Did what?

920
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,248
Killed my father.

921
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,117
- What? You really did?
- You told me to.

922
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:19,250
Me? I didn't tell you to do
anything, you little monster!

923
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,704
Get up.
How could you do such a thing?

924
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:33,842
People will find out
you've been coming around here.

925
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:37,605
I never told you
to do such a thing! Never!

926
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,873
Come on, get up.

927
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,677
My dear Edmund, calm down.

928
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:44,820
We'll see what we can do.

929
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,353
I really am fond of you,
my boy.

930
01:04:27,763 --> 01:04:30,391
- Can I play with you?
- No, we're playing by ourselves.

931
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:33,467
- I can show you how to play.
- No.

932
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,836
Come on.

933
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:28,926
Mr. Rademacher!

934
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:32,231
Someone should tell the children.

935
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,110
- Where's Edmund?
- I haven't seen him.

936
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,279
Have you seen Edmund?

937
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,416
We'll find him.

938
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,704
My God!

938
01:12:25,305 --> 01:13:25,643
