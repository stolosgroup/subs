3
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:34,035
<i>Salty and sweet.</i>

4
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,996
<i>That was my mother.</i>

5
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:44,170
<i>Always did have a flavor for danger.</i>

6
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:58,559
<i>Pickled in her wine,
She so desperately tried.</i>

7
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:15,076
<i>Oh, but she couldn't
take care of me, mm-mm.</i>

8
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,203
<i>Not like you did, anyway.</i>

9
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,959
<i>Lord, I know you
put me here for a reason,</i>

10
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,379
<i>and Lord knows I've tried to forget it.</i>

11
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:32,218
<i>But through all these
choppy waters, I thank you,</i>

12
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,305
<i>my dear Jesus, for keeping
this humble heart beating free.</i>

13
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:44,188
<i>My love, my Lord, my savior.</i>

14
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,713
I love you, I love you, I love you.
I just wanna marry you.

15
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,507
Oh, Jesus, you're my one and only.

16
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,968
I swear, I will always...

17
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,636
Hey, I told you to clean the...

18
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,806
Really?

19
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,395
This is what you're doing
in the middle of the goddamn day? Great.

20
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,941
Can't you just be a normal kid?

21
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:05,478
<i>Normal kid?</i>
<i>Well, how'd I do?</i>

22
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:10,191
<i>Yeah, not so great, I guess.</i>

23
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,234
<i>But not Your fault so much,</i>

24
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,988
<i>unless this was all a part
of Your silly old plan.</i>

25
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:46,727
<i>Fuck me. I can't believe
you're making me do this shit.</i>

26
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:56,654
Hello again.

27
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,407
I'm Merle, sex and love addict.

28
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,325
Hi, Merle.

29
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,577
Well, in spite of all
the progress I've made,

30
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:08,290
I... recently had
another bottom line slip.

31
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,545
I'm really ashamed. I...

32
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,383
I really thought this time
was gonna be different.

33
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,552
A real relationship, you know?

34
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,306
That lasted all of six days.

35
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,935
Um, our final night together, he, um...

36
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,983
bit my lip so hard it bled,
and I started to cry.

37
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:38,737
Um, and then he told me
that he had a fantasy

38
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:42,241
of making love to a woman
while she was crying.

39
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:48,414
So mission accomplished.

40
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,957
But...

41
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,668
He told me that he loved me.

42
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,671
And then after he left, he, um...

43
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,968
blocked my number and unfollowed me.

44
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,891
And I just feel really worthless.

45
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:24,074
<i>And You said,
"I am the light of the world,</i>

46
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:28,162
<i>but he who follows me
will not walk in the darkness,</i>

47
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:32,041
<i>but shall have the light of love."</i>

48
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,555
Do I know you?

49
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,975
Uh, yeah. I'm, uh... I'm Mads, I'm here...

50
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,519
Oh, Evie's friend from home.

51
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,522
They do grow 'em pretty in Texas.

52
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,775
You're late.

53
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:43,696
I didn't know there was
a set schedule for this shit.

54
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,781
Come in.

55
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,912
Wait, so you're... you're not American?

56
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,291
- Cause, like, on your TV show you were...
- Acting.

57
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:59,378
- Oh. Ah, funny.
- Can I get you something?

58
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,131
Uh, no, no, I'm cool as a cucumber.

59
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,842
So you're out here
to be an actress?

60
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,219
Uh, no, no.

61
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,097
Ah, most people are here to be something.

62
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:15,311
Escape whatever unseen invalidated life
they're running from.

63
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,313
Are you ambitious?

64
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,774
Ambition always seemed like
kind of a pointy word to me.

65
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:26,572
Like, um, arrow or thorn,
you know, it just...

66
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,034
I feel like it just depends
on the things you're into.

67
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:36,749
Um, but I do think that I'm meant
for, um, something or somebody.

68
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:40,628
A romantic. You're a rare animal.

69
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,173
Take a word of advice
from a kindred spirit:

70
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:49,219
Keep moving before you get stuck.
This place is a trap, you know.

71
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,597
Just like those pits down by the museums.

72
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,267
Thousands of years ago,
this whole valley was a swamp.

73
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:57,978
Animals came from hundreds
of miles around.

74
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,439
Mammoths, sabretooth cats,

75
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,524
uh, dire wolves,

76
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,403
all lured by the scent of sweet water.

77
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,782
But the ground under this place
isn't solid, it's tar.

78
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,868
Black and sticky as the devil's shit.

79
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,663
Those animals, they got trapped in it.

80
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,706
And their dying cries
brought out scavengers

81
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,042
looking for an easy meal,
and they got stuck too.

82
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,795
Thousands of years later,

83
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:26,298
scientists are still pulling fossils
out of those pits.

84
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:29,259
Skeletons all mixed up.

85
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:33,806
Be careful, or someday someone
will be digging you up.

86
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:39,019
And with so many bones, they won't
even be able to tell you apart.

87
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:45,609
The trick to LA is take a sip
from the spring, spread your wings.

88
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:49,822
Catch a breeze and ride on out of here
before you get stuck.

89
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,657
Um...

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,036
Why do dealers
always sound like preachers?

91
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,540
I mean, honestly,
are you a prophet or a pusher?

92
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,418
- Just make up your mind.
- Hm.

93
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,878
Yeah, I don't know.

94
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,840
Evie tells me you girls
are working the club tonight.

95
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:11,760
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
I think I might, uh, come by.

96
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,140
You can always work for me, you know.

97
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:22,771
Uh, look, I just came here 'cause I got
a car and I was in the neighborhood.

98
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:28,235
I'm not really looking to be your friendly
neighborhood dope peddler, but thank you.

99
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,405
By the way, I love
your big, fat, gold LTD.

100
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,074
'72? Don't see them around much.

101
00:09:34,158 --> 00:09:36,618
Um... mm-hm.

102
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:42,166
I know your ride, I know your plates,
I know your friends.

103
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,793
So what don't I know about you, Mads?

104
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,726
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Cool.

105
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,394
- Uh...
- Thanks for coming by.

106
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,104
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

107
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,376
Good morning.

108
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,506
- Little package.
- Teddy.

109
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,804
Hey, Mads, um...

110
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,185
Did you ever hear from that, uh,
guy you were fucking at community?

111
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,354
What?

112
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,482
Didn't he get a job out here or something?

113
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,735
No idea what on earth
made you think of him.

114
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,781
I don't know, maybe it
was, urn, all these drugs.

115
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,953
Oh, well, well, well.

116
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:05,624
You know, you really oughta
quit that dumbass job of yours.

117
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,084
Oh, boy.

118
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:12,297
Come on, like, folding $400
sweaters for ten bucks an hour.

119
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:16,844
It's an insult to your post-modern
feminist sensibilities.

120
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,345
Oh, is it?

121
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,597
We've got to work to destabilize

122
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,725
the patriarchal norms
entrenched into a society

123
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,687
that has caused so much gender inequality.

124
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,815
I love how much
you care about this.

125
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,695
Plus, you'd make way more
selling Eric's drugs.

126
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:40,075
Well, well, I also got fired last night.

127
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,327
- Why?
- What?

128
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:43,453
Mm...

129
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:50,961
Because I... kinda sorta...

130
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,255
fucked the boss's husband again!

131
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,882
- Again?
- Again!

132
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,842
That's awesome!

133
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,219
I guess old habits die hard, sweetie.

134
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:03,390
- They do.
- Well, then it's settled.

135
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,893
You're working at the club with us now!

136
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,978
- No!
- Yes!

137
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,605
I said maybe.

138
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:14,192
<i>Working at the club,
aka, selling a bunch of shit-ass drugs</i>

139
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,820
<i>to LA's horniest crackheads.</i>

140
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,584
Yay! She's fun again!

141
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,587
Whoo!

142
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:56,193
Oh, come on, Mads, it's gonna be fun.

143
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,402
Told you.

144
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,040
You know they say Marilyn's buried here.

145
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,626
And also James Dean,
and also Whitney Houston.

146
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,795
- Let's have a séance.
- I can't believe this.

147
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,134
Oh, my Lord.

148
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:34,731
So, another little sister here
from Texas to help Evie out.

149
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,858
Sort of.

150
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,945
Only Addy's my actual blood.

151
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,072
We grew up with Mads.

152
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,491
She's like our honorary little sister.

153
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,702
Well, we're all family here.

154
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,496
- Hey, Gamor.
- Hm?

155
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,165
- What do you think?
- Hm...

156
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,293
Well, let me take a look.

157
00:13:55,377 --> 00:14:02,050
Let's see here, a little vintage jewelry,
smoky eye, pouty red lip.

158
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,886
I like it. She's like a gothic Madonna.

159
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:12,561
It's funny you say that because
Mads has like a little Jesus thing.

160
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:16,273
- Ooh, Jesus.
- Yeah. Um, I'd say that she

161
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,442
takes it to the next level, though.

162
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,486
Mads doesn't just love Jesus,
she'd love to fuck Jesus.

163
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,030
Hey!

164
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,657
- It's true.
- You can't blame her,

165
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,286
Jesus Is quite sexy.
Our first rock star.

166
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,912
- Mm-hm.
- Definitely.

167
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:36,251
<i>Well, little does she know,
I do fuck You.</i>

168
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,670
<i>I fuck You all the time.</i>

169
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:44,718
Well, Mads' outfit is preordained.
So, let's go.

170
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,054
Doors open in 20 minutes.

171
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,430
Tits up.

172
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,682
Uh, Carmen, put some lip gloss on, too.

173
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:53,643
You're looking a little tired.
All right, here. Drink that up.

174
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,270
Eleven minutes, come on.

175
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,159
<i>You're my one and only.</i>

176
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,589
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

177
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,516
<i>I swear, I will always...</i>

178
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,685
<i>I swear, I will always...</i>

179
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:34,870
<i>Well, there just went
200 bucks of Eric's crap.</i>

180
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,331
<i>Oh, God, I should've listened to You.</i>

181
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,921
<i>Why don't I listen to You?</i>

182
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:53,096
<i>Mom always told me that
was never much my strong suit.</i>

183
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,473
<i>Maybe she was right.</i>

184
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,559
<i>Fucking bitch.</i>

185
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,728
A tripping nun.

186
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,691
That is so fucked.

187
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,777
There you are.

188
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,616
Are you okay?

189
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,993
Your shift is done.

190
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,790
Why don't you just get changed
and put on some makeup.

191
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:26,504
We're gonna have
a little late-night disco at our place.

192
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,217
Okay.

193
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,201
Fuck!

194
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,997
I'm so sorry! Oh, my God!

195
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,042
Who was he?! Who was that guy?!

196
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,501
Oh, my God, he's just some guy
I brought home.

197
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,669
- I'm sorry.
- Who was he?!

198
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,171
What the fuck just happened?

199
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:34,966
- Oh, my God!
- The money is all gone!

200
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,093
- He fucking took the money!
- I'm sorry!

201
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,554
That stupid fucking douchebag,
he took the money!

202
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:43,266
That guy with the long hair,
I think he took all the drugs!

203
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,476
- Wait!
- What the fuck?!

204
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,478
That guy just fucking left!

205
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,069
Evie...

206
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,654
- Evie, what the fuck?!
- I'm sorry.

207
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:00,158
- Eight fucking grand!
- I'm so sorry.

208
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:04,537
Evie, why do you
drag me into this shit?! Huh?!

209
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,749
You're supposed
to be my older sister!

210
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:09,000
- Stop yelling at her.
- Don't start.

211
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,502
Okay, it's not helping anything.

212
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,337
- Well, what's the plan?
- You need to call Eric.

213
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,464
- You need to call Eric.
- Can you just do it, please?

214
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,383
He needs to fucking know

215
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,928
why all the money and all his
fucking drugs are gone, okay?

216
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,347
Can you just please do it?
Because he has a crush on you.

217
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,224
And he's not gonna yell at you,
and he always yells at me.

218
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,393
- Oh, my God, Evie.
- I need a fucking cigarette.

219
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,061
- You're so much better at this than me.
- Where's the lighter?

220
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:30,230
- I can't do it.
- Where the fuck is the lighter?

221
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,774
Um... Please.

222
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,153
I'm so sorry.

223
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,614
- Evie...
- Just fucking call Eric.

224
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,659
- Just go and call Eric.
- I'm so sorry.

225
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,876
What the fuck is this?

226
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:54,838
I don't...

227
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,549
<i>What do you mean gone?</i>

228
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,760
- It's gone. Stolen?
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

229
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:03,179
No, no, no.

230
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,016
I trusted you guys
to fulfill basic services.

231
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,061
<i>This is fucking unprofessional.</i>

232
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,440
Yeah, well, I mean, we fucked up.

233
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,608
<i>Well, you better un-fuck it up.</i>

234
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:19,487
<i>This is not some random shit I got off
of one of my usual guys.</i>

235
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:21,531
This is a scary fucking drug dealer

236
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,158
that I'm trying to make
a good impression with.

237
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,161
And spoiler alert,
this is not impressive!

238
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,580
You know what? How about you just

239
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,249
stop being such a little bitch
and nut up, okay?

240
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:36,212
<i>It wasn't a kilo, it was 20 grand tops.
We'll figure it out.</i>

241
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,298
What's this fucking guy's name?

242
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:42,427
Her name! Queenie,
and she does not fuck around!

243
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,485
Get out!

244
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,244
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

245
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,122
<i>So either find who stole that shit</i>

246
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:15,585
or find a way to get me
that 20 grand back! Fuck!

247
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,298
Fuck you too, then.

248
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:27,639
Fuck!

249
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,643
Guys, he's really fucking freaking out.

250
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,145
- We're being fucking evicted!
- No.

251
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,606
- What?
- We're being evicted!

252
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,741
You know,
this is why I left.

253
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,536
This is why I left and went to London,

254
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,247
because I didn't want
to be fucking poor in America!

255
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,165
Okay.

256
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,293
And I don't wanna be around a sister
who's a fucking crack addict.

257
00:22:57,377 --> 00:23:00,088
Okay, it's a coke addict,
not a crack addict.

258
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,258
Such a fucking bitch all the time.

259
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,301
- Fuck you. Fuck you.
- I'm so tired of it.

260
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,345
Seriously, this could've
happened to anybody.

261
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:11,432
- We all had a party.
- Fuck! Fuck!

262
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:14,727
Fucking hair!

263
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,742
Fucking dollar bill, please. Oh, God.

264
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,386
<i>Fucking poor in America?</i>

265
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,888
<i>Who wants to be poor anywhere?</i>

266
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:55,143
<i>The world's one big shit show
and I'm right in the middle of it.</i>

267
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,479
<i>Fuck them! Seriously, I'm not poor.</i>

268
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,190
<i>I have You.</i>

269
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:04,027
<i>They can all suck my Jesus dick.</i>

270
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,324
<i>Cocksuckers.</i>

271
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,955
<i>Don't look at me like that.
Where do you think I'm driving?</i>

272
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,291
<i>I'm trying to look
for a place to live, fuck.</i>

273
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:29,218
<i>Okay, well, I fucking tried
to get a roof over our heads,</i>

274
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,888
<i>and this bitch, she don't get it.</i>

275
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,682
<i>You know what? Fuck her
and her piece of shit house,</i>

276
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:38,394
<i>and the horse she rode in on.
She probably fucked him too.</i>

277
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,690
Fuck!

278
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,891
What's up, sexy man?

279
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,571
You know, I made a lot of bad decisions.

280
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:34,033
Some shit You seriously don't...

281
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,078
agree with.

282
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,125
I don't blame You.

283
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,463
But, You see,
I've been trying to be better.

284
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,715
Right, I mean...

285
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,510
I definitely be fucking way less.

286
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,971
Kinda.

287
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:01,477
Anyway, right now...

288
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,691
Right now,
I need Your help more than ever.

289
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,947
I need You to walk me down
Your righteous ways.

290
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,950
I need You to show me
that light because...

291
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,332
I really just don't wanna
hurt no more people.

292
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,427
Show me a sign.

293
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,722
Show me a sign.

294
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,478
Show me a sign.

295
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,953
You're a fucking badass.

296
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,583
Whoo! I love You, JC!

297
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,418
I fucking love You!

298
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,880
Whoo!

299
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,059
- Please tell me you found it.
- No, I told you, it's gone.

300
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,395
Shit! You guys have forced me
to do something I don't want to do.

301
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,855
I do not want to give you girls up.

302
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,732
But that Queenie plays rough.

303
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,984
You think I'm a fucking idiot

304
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,612
just 'cause I have an innie?
You're the big dog,

305
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,865
okay, not some low-level, street pawn.

306
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:43,621
No matter how bad we might fuck up,
that money is ultimately on you, bud.

307
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,873
I can make you get that money back.

308
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,543
Why are you fronting on me right now?

309
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,753
You're no pimp, you're no Killer.

310
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,799
You're just a has-been TV actor with
a gambling addiction and a coke habit.

311
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,553
And... and my sense tells me

312
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:03,349
that clearly you're broke as fuck,
and you're in some real type of trouble

313
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:07,353
because nobody runs a business
like that with no security.

314
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:11,482
I mean, that is just
desperation behavior.

315
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,986
Uh-huh, out of control.
And that shit ends bad.

316
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:20,491
So, like I said, I don't have a problem.

317
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:21,909
You do.

318
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,748
Why are you even here?

319
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,922
Where the fuck is your bedroom?

320
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,784
<i>You're so awesome.</i>

321
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:10,374
<i>Oh, I can't even stand
to breathe when I think of You.</i>

322
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,838
<i>I will always be your girl, Jesus.</i>

323
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,431
<i>I wasn't expecting that from you.</i>

324
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:31,687
Yep, I'm full of surprises.

325
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,942
I gotta go pee.

326
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,407
Mads?

327
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:47,954
Babe?

328
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:49,413
Oh, fuck!

329
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:52,750
You're crazy. This is never gonna work.

330
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:54,460
Of course it'll work.

331
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,462
You ever heard of
"Jesus take the wheel"?

332
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,174
Well, in our case,
Jesus has taken us by the hips

333
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,802
with his manly,
calloused carpenter hands

334
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:06,681
and he is riding us all the way
back home to Kingdom Come.

335
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:10,184
I'm telling you,
Jesus will not steer us wrong.

336
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:13,813
Uh, I'm an atheist.

337
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,234
Well, not anymore you're not.

338
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:25,157
Okay, so we're just supposed
to tell people we came to Hollywood

339
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,326
to start a convent?

340
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,705
Only if they ask. Just keep it simple.

341
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,542
So we'll meet back here in two hours.

342
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,854
Sisters of the faithful.

343
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,608
Hey. Oh, thank you. Do you know where
to get waxed around here?

344
00:31:00,943 --> 00:31:05,197
Oh. Wait, two bucks?

345
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:07,324
That's all you're gonna give Jesus?

346
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,705
Fuck.

347
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,251
Lady, do you want your soul
to be damned for all eternity,

348
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,045
tossing Lucifer's salad?

349
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,630
You can afford more, look at you.

350
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,179
Oh, thank you. God bless... Jesus Christ!

351
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:32,058
- You all right?
- Oh, hell yeah. Uh, sorry.

352
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,477
Bitch.

353
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:43,319
We are starting
a convent here in Hollywood,

354
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,906
and if you would like
to know more, here is my cell.

355
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,951
Look, I wrote it right
where Jesus got hammered.

356
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,497
- I dream of being hammered, too.
- Thank you.

357
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,168
Hi, Sister.

358
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,630
- I see you like books.
- I work at the library.

359
00:32:02,713 --> 00:32:03,839
Oh.

360
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,762
Are you visiting Los Angeles, Sister?
I haven't seen you before.

361
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:15,434
Uh, well, my little convent back home
is just bursting at the seams,

362
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:19,355
so my Mother Superior
sent myself and my sisters

363
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:24,235
down to, you know, look
for a new home and spread our, uh,

364
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:28,072
our virginity... di-divinity.

365
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,365
Where are you staying?

366
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:34,036
Uh, well, I'm leaving that up
to the good Lord himself.

367
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,540
- Mm-hm.
- Well, uh...

368
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,958
I hope it's not too much of a bother,

369
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:41,293
but one of our board members
at our library,

370
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,255
Maria Ramirez,
everyone calls her Sunny.

371
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:47,925
Um, you know, she's a devout Catholic
and generous donor.

372
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:50,219
- Um, her husband just died recently...
- Oh.

373
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,931
...and, um, you and the sisters
should, uh, go... go see her.

374
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,599
She lives right up the road up there.

375
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,352
Um, great place.
She takes in nuns all the time.

376
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,231
She does?

377
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,318
Well, look at God just
working his ways.

378
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,903
Well, she's a very kind person.

379
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:09,655
And listen,
she has more than enough space.

380
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,657
You guys should check it out
if you need a place to stay.

381
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,995
All right? I think she'd love it,
so here's her number.

382
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,997
Oops.

383
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,709
Sorry. Um... Okay.

384
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,043
That's for you guys.

385
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,715
Thank you. Good day, sir. So kind.

386
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:36,473
Two-hundred and seventy-three dollars.

387
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,434
Thank you, Jesus!

388
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,104
Yes, that is enough to get a cheap
hotel room for a couple of nights.

389
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:44,398
Or a really nice hotel room for one night.

390
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,066
No, no, no.

391
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,279
We gotta save our money
as much as we can. We should, um...

392
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,573
We should go stay with that nice lady.

393
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:56,118
But how do...
how do you know she's so nice?

394
00:33:56,202 --> 00:34:01,916
Because she offers
to take in stray nuns.

395
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:06,045
Um, she is probably
really religious though.

396
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,297
And she's probably seen
a lot of nuns before.

397
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,800
So... we should, uh...

398
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,594
We should go do our research.

399
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,138
- Mm-hm, up our game.
- Okay.

400
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,974
What kind of research?

401
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:23,354
Wait, Mads, you want us to go to church?

402
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:26,106
Goddamn right. We're going to church!

403
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,984
But first...
first we really need to change,

404
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,029
'cause the only thing worse than walking
into a church impersonating a nun

405
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,032
is walking into a police station
impersonating a cop.

406
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,700
So let's go.

407
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,413
God.

408
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,928
What do you think
you're looking at, old man?

409
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,763
Nothing.

410
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:02,059
Hm. That's "Nothing, Sister," to you.

411
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:07,648
- Nothing, Sister.
- Mm-hm. Good boy.

412
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,901
Now start praying.

413
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,861
Dear God...

414
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:18,575
please help me with another sister.

415
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:21,537
Addy!

416
00:35:22,663 --> 00:35:24,290
I like this character!

417
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,375
- I could really get into this!
- Bitch.

418
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,800
"Find out..." What?

419
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:38,304
Fuck! No. No.

420
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,557
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

421
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,565
No.

422
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:03,120
<i>The fucking gun!</i>

423
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,788
Where the fuck is it?

424
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,041
Fuck!

425
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,970
Ah! Fuck.

426
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,078
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

427
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,570
No! Bucky, no!

428
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,578
No, Bucky, no!

429
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,185
I'll open the door on one condition.

430
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:56,400
I was gonna open the door.

431
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,194
My name's Tuff, I work for Queenie.

432
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:03,824
Sit.

433
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,578
Make me a vodka.

434
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:11,498
It's okay, Bucky, this is a friend.

435
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:14,418
We're just playing a friendly game.

436
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,795
- I don't think he can breathe.
- He's fucking fine.

437
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:20,632
Aren't you, silly Billy?
It's just a friendly game, right.

438
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,885
Come on, man, this has nothing
to do with the kid.

439
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:27,347
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Are you allergic to bees?

440
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,603
What a coincidence. So am I.

441
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,772
Deathly allergic.
And when you're allergic to bees,

442
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,816
you need to be prepared.

443
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,153
Do you... know what one of these is?

444
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,321
- Oh, Jesus, man, don't.
- Ah, ah.

445
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,491
This protects you from the queen.

446
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:50,412
And believe me, you do not
wanna get stung by her.

447
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,914
What have you done?

448
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,168
What have you done?

449
00:38:57,711 --> 00:38:59,213
Motherfucker!

450
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:02,067
When you receive the communion,

451
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,944
you're united with Jesus.

452
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,825
And He becomes a part of you.

453
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,560
Body of Christ.

454
00:41:18,477 --> 00:41:19,936
May God be with you.

455
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,147
Oh, you know, very.

456
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,025
May God be with you.

457
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,111
- And to you too, Sister.
- Sister Julie.

458
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,696
Thank you for coming.

459
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,742
- Hm, Sister Julie.
- Sister Julie.

460
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:36,119
I think it's time to go.

461
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,830
What was that about?

462
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,348
Tuff? Why is there a child?

463
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,522
You know I hate them.

464
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:12,155
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi.

465
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,202
Yuck. Why is he tied like that?

466
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:21,331
I had to use the venom
on the kid, and then...

467
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:22,541
Well, look.

468
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:32,175
Right?

469
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:35,929
It's for softening the meat.

470
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,139
Ah...

471
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,642
Well...

472
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,688
Nice to meet you... Eric.

473
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:05,917
These shoes hurt my feet.

474
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,087
I can finish this off.

475
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:11,631
Tuff is so good to me.

476
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:21,558
Huh... So, Eric,

477
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,769
we've been talking about you.

478
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,937
What's your purpose?

479
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,064
What function do you serve?

480
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,985
If one cannot perform his function,

481
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:36,615
then another must take his place.

482
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:46,708
Oh. Huh.

483
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:50,420
These are the females
who lost my merchandise.

484
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:56,343
Did you know there's a species
of carpenter ant in Malaysia?

485
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,057
The queen's body
is full of poisonous venom.

486
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,895
And if her nest
is threatened by an outsider,

487
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:11,650
this magnificent creature
can explode her own head

488
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,528
in a suicide,

489
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:19,157
and release a substance onto her enemy.

490
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:22,869
What a soldier.

491
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:32,087
No.

492
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:41,096
- No.
- This is what I'm talking about, Eric.

493
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,474
- Oh, my God.
- Purpose.

494
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:47,727
- Now you have one.
- Oh, my God.

495
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:51,773
- Dinner.
- Oh, no.

496
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:09,267
Sisters, welcome to my home.

497
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:12,771
You'll have to excuse me,
my eyesight isn't what it used to be.

498
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,981
You see, I've become
terribly sensitive to the light,

499
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:18,193
which is a shame, because the light
is one of my favorite things

500
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,111
about living in southern California.

501
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,865
In a moment, Alicia will
show you to your quarters,

502
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:28,203
and hope you can meet me for tea
in the sunroom once you've settled in.

503
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,372
Let us know if you need anything.

504
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,917
And thank you so much for coming. Alicia.

505
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:38,797
Uh, thank you for, uh,

506
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,468
having us in your godly home, ma'am.

507
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,220
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

508
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,605
There's so much space
just in this one area.

509
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:03,071
You know, you guys,
the craziest thing about all of this

510
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,409
is that that thing,
the thing we're wearing around our necks,

511
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:10,078
is called a wimple.

512
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,663
What the fuck is a wimple?

513
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:18,336
- ...get away with it.
- Fuck you.

514
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:25,468
Oh, my God.

515
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:29,180
I kinda feel bad for Sunny.

516
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:35,520
I mean, all this money
and no one to share it with.

517
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:39,232
No, she played her cards right.

518
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,485
She gets to do whatever she wants,
doesn't have to look after anybody.

519
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,199
Oh, fuck!

520
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,368
It's Eric. Should I answer it?

521
00:47:50,452 --> 00:47:51,661
No!

522
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:03,673
No answer.

523
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,760
Well, we'll try again later.

524
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:21,775
I don't think we can hit the same spot two
days in a row. I think we should rotate.

525
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:23,526
You know, the giving can't always...

526
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:25,612
...be so giving.

527
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,536
If I may make a suggestion.

528
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:36,247
Outside the observatory
might be a good place.

529
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:40,085
- Mm.
- Lots of foot traffic.

530
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,544
- Oh.

531
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:44,172
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

532
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,301
- Thank you so much, Alicia.
- You're welcome.

533
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,888
Now, if you excuse me,
before madam's breakfast gets cold.

534
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,725
Oh, my God.

535
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:57,352
She's so fucking hot.

536
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,479
Well, that one's a hot piece of ass.

537
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,689
Oh, my God.

538
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,441
<i>...the body of Eric Katz,</i>

539
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,443
<i>the actor best known
for playing Uncle Darby</i>

540
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,904
<i>in the 90s sitcom,</i> The Sokolowiski's,

541
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:11,282
<i>was discovered in his home.
Police investigators are saying</i>

542
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:13,868
<i>the bizarre circumstances
surrounding his death</i>

543
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:18,206
<i>are likely attributed to his rumored ties
with local drug organizations.</i>

544
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:21,960
Holy fuck! Fu... fudge.

545
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,712
<i>An unidentified 12-year-old
was also discovered in the home...</i>

546
00:49:24,796 --> 00:49:27,507
- Oh, my God, poor Eric.
- <i>...unconscious but alive,</i>

547
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,759
<i>and taken to a local hospital.</i>

548
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:31,845
What are we gonna do?

549
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:38,226
- Fuck! Ninety-six bucks in change. God!
- This is so bad.

550
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:42,272
That's all the money we have?
That's all the profits?

551
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:44,274
Where the fuck is Jesus today?

552
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:47,735
Maybe we're being punished.

553
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,530
Maybe there's a curse
against people that pretend to be saints.

554
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:54,659
Nuns aren't saints,
they're just regular people

555
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,786
who work for God by doing charity.

556
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,538
And, technically, we're homeless,

557
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:02,917
so really we're just
cutting out the middle man.

558
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,045
Oh, you can just justify anything, Mads.

559
00:50:06,129 --> 00:50:08,298
Why have you been on my dick
so much recently, Addy?

560
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:10,133
- I love you and your dick.
- Honestly...

561
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:13,219
What the fuck?

562
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,685
Scum-sucking piece of shit!
Who the fuck fucks with nuns, huh?!

563
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,770
Why would you steal from a nun?!

564
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:33,990
<i>Now, you might think this
is a bit of an excessive reaction.</i>

565
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:43,041
<i>But we all have our periods synched up,
and as you can see,</i>

566
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,127
<i>we're already having
a pretty cramp ass day.</i>

567
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:53,092
When you receive the communion,
you are united with Jesus.

568
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:56,012
And He becomes a part of you.

569
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,060
<i>You once told me
the danger of us sinning</i>

570
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:04,896
<i>isn't that God would stop forgiving us,</i>

571
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,942
<i>it's that we will stop
seeking his forgiveness.</i>

572
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,489
<i>And so just like you wanted,</i>

573
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:20,745
<i>I went to confess my sins,
past, present and future.</i>

574
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:36,678
<i>Ever since I accepted You into my heart
as my Lord and my savior,</i>

575
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:39,847
<i>it took me to that sacred place.</i>

576
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:06,958
<i>I'm not sitting across
from a mortal man no more.</i>

577
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:11,504
<i>I'm being sent directly
through him to You.</i>

578
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:06,517
It appears the winds
have changed since we last met.

579
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:11,898
Sunny skies have given way
to a dark cloud that now looms above you.

580
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:17,695
Dark cloud? What dark cloud?

581
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:24,827
This trio of sorceresses,
they will challenge your reign.

582
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,498
They will be your undoing
if you are not careful.

583
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,835
Those sluts stole my money.

584
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:35,004
And you mentioned three of them, right?

585
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,715
I only saw two of them.

586
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:42,011
Bitch, I told you, there's three.

587
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:46,265
There's three. Three sluts.
One slut, two slut, three slut...

588
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:47,558
- That's not a slut.
- Oh.

589
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:49,727
Just one, two, three sluts.

590
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:55,024
Should I kill them?

591
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,528
Yes.

592
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,244
Kill them.

593
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:14,085
- Nobody misses President Lincoln.
- I'm so bored.

594
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,087
We could be at the club right now.

595
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,298
Really?

596
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,884
Well, we could sneak on out of here.

597
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:25,138
- Mm-hm.
- Go down the lattice like ninjas.

598
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,557
- Yeah.
- Why not?

599
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,435
And I think Sunny's asleep.

600
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,521
- Let's go.
- Okay.

601
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:36,566
If you blow our cover, we're fucked.

602
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,283
All right, I'll stay here. You go.

603
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:49,454
- But...
- I'm on my period anyway, I'm bloated.

604
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:50,788
I don't wanna be touched by,

605
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:53,833
- like, gross old men.
- Okay, have a good night.

606
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:55,501
You guys suck these days.

607
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:00,715
Oh, I hate this thing.

608
00:55:58,606 --> 00:56:04,362
Huh, so this LA bimbo,
who is one of the sorceresses,

609
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:08,115
she thinks she's going
to crumble our empire.

610
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:21,671
She's the one that stole your stash, babe.

611
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:25,633
Eric kept a ledger
in the notes on his phone, what a genius,

612
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,969
and she's his points man.

613
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,304
What?

614
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:36,894
Well, we're going to make
a little example out of her, aren't we?

615
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,274
Have you met my friend?

616
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:44,986
The coral snake?

617
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:48,239
They mostly feed on rats,

618
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,784
bats, little rodents.

619
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,662
But we've discovered...

620
00:56:54,745 --> 00:57:00,209
...this one has an insatiable appetite
on human brains.

621
00:57:00,293 --> 00:57:03,296
- Wanna see?
- I'm gonna film it.

622
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:06,424
And then I'm gonna text it
to your sorceress friends.

623
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:03,981
Something's wrong.

624
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:10,363
- She's not picking up her phone.
- So call her again.

625
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:14,617
I did. I called five times.

626
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,911
I feel like, I don't know,
it's off or dead.

627
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,538
Just... don't say the word dead.

628
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,582
Can you please just sit the fuck down?

629
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,417
You're making me even more crazy.

630
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,008
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

631
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:34,095
What the fuck happened?
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

632
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,430
- Evie.
- Sit, sit.

633
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:41,102
- What the fuck?
- Okay, I killed them.

634
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:44,438
- Killed who?
- Uh, I killed both of them.

635
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:45,773
- What?
- Who?

636
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:49,318
Queenie and her psycho cowboy sidekick.

637
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:52,029
- What?
- Yeah, they kidnapped me.

638
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:54,949
They... they tried to kill me.

639
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,909
- Oh, my God.
- But I... I killed them.

640
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:00,121
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

641
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,289
Okay, we have to get out of LA, you guys.

642
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:05,960
The cops are gonna come after me.
I'm a little scared.

643
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:09,880
- Why?
- Because I killed them.

644
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:12,383
Calm down, calm down.

645
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,552
Let me just think.

646
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,346
We're fine.

647
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:18,973
- We're fine, you know why?
- Why?

648
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:23,352
Because the cops, they don't give a shit.

649
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,731
Yeah. They're never gonna find out
because they don't care!

650
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:30,818
That's just two less bottom-feeding
drug dealers that are gone!

651
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:34,363
I mean, you literally
just did their jobs tonight.

652
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,741
That they... Hallelujah!

653
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:40,161
Right?

654
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:43,038
Yeah, you killed
the motherfucker who killed Eric.

655
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,832
An eye for an eye.

656
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,168
Hey, Mads, isn't that in the Bible?

657
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:50,546
You're sure the fuck right it is.

658
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,423
You know... you know what else?

659
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,967
- What?
- We're in the clear.

660
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:58,012
- Oh, my God.
- You know what that means, right?

661
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,139
There's no more killers anymore.

662
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,600
- Mm-hm.
- We have money coming in.

663
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:06,103
- Oh, yeah.
- We have a roof over our heads.

664
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:09,732
This is literally our rebirth.

665
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,650
Oh, my God, you're right.

666
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:13,986
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my God!

667
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,405
- I can't believe our luck.
- Dude, we're so fucking lucky.

668
01:00:16,489 --> 01:00:18,699
No, no, it's not luck!

669
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:23,704
It's... It is exactly divine intervention.

670
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:27,750
I mean, it's clear as day.

671
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,795
This is Jesus coming down
and taking the wheel.

672
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,546
Oh, my God.

673
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,591
I mean, we all knew he would...
lead us down the right path,

674
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:39,637
but... but tonight he actually did it.

675
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,138
Yeah.

676
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:42,890
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Thank you.

677
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,519
I didn't even
believe in God before.

678
01:00:46,602 --> 01:00:49,230
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, I was so fucking scared.

679
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:52,483
Oh, my God,
I was too. I love you guys.

680
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,109
Oh, my God, tell me
everything that happened!

681
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:56,821
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, so okay.

682
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:58,614
- There were snakes.
- What?

683
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:00,783
Two snakes, a black and a red one.

684
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:02,201
What were they
doing with the snakes?

685
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,828
Oh, my God, so one was like...

686
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,220
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

687
01:01:48,873 --> 01:01:51,041
I know what
you're planning on doing.

688
01:01:55,421 --> 01:02:00,467
And I'd think real long
and hard before doing it, if I were you.

689
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,056
Yeah, well, you are me.

690
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:12,021
You've been given a rare gift.
A clean slate.

691
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:15,190
Why do you always have
to fall back on bad habits?

692
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:22,114
I've made my decision,
and I feel bad enough about it already.

693
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,033
So can you just drop it?

694
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,998
But do bad girls go to heaven too?

695
01:02:36,045 --> 01:02:38,088
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

696
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,453
<i>Here's the thing:</i>

697
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:54,206
<i>I know You like all that</i>

698
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:59,670
<i>meditation, hallelujah,
peace on earth bullshit.</i>

699
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,631
<i>But have You ever done heroin?</i>

700
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:05,384
<i>We both know I have.</i>

701
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:09,555
<i>'Cause there's not one minute in my life</i>

702
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,932
<i>where I'm not thinking about it.</i>

703
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:16,478
<i>It's the total escape of feeling.</i>

704
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:20,232
<i>Pure oblivion.</i>

705
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,820
<i>Sweet Jesus,</i>

706
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:29,700
<i>she almost makes me forget You.</i>

707
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,699
Hello?

708
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:20,375
Help! Help! Somebody!

709
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:23,754
Somebody help! Help! Help!

710
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:03,460
JC?

711
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,466
Holy shit!

712
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,136
God's a woman?

713
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,721
With tattoos?

714
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:20,602
Whoa. Fuck me, that's badass.

715
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,947
Holy shit, I've been waiting
to meet You my whole life.

716
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,032
Wow.

717
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:41,540
Jesus.

718
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,794
I'm sorry.

719
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:49,715
I love You so much.

720
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,927
I'm sorry I'm such a fuckup.

721
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,556
But from now on...

722
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:01,768
I swear,
I wanna do right by You, Lord.

723
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:07,399
I do, I... I wanna be different.

724
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:11,236
And I know I... I know I've been saying
that this whole time, but...

725
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,489
We also know that...

726
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:20,370
you know, I kinda have a gift
for rationalizing things.

727
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:28,545
From now on, I wanna be the kinda person
that makes You proud.

728
01:07:31,632 --> 01:07:34,009
I swear, from this rebirth and this...

729
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:39,556
this fresh start that You've
so generously given me...

730
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:46,939
I swear it in my soul, Lord,
I swear it in my soul.

731
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:53,028
Thank you, Lord.

732
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:56,949
Thanks.

733
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:09,586
Honey?

734
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,756
Sweetie, it's time to take your meds.

735
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:29,398
Where... where the fuck is Jesus?

736
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,858
He's in your heart, sweetie.

737
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:33,819
He's in all of our hearts.

738
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,037
- Mads.
- Mads.

739
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,456
Are you okay?

740
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:03,473
Hello? Alicia?

741
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,892
Sisters?

742
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,311
Who is that?

743
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,524
Beautiful place you have here, madam.

744
01:09:12,607 --> 01:09:15,819
- Wouldn't you agree, my dear?
- Yeah, very fancy.

745
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:18,447
Sort of lovely old knickknacks.

746
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:20,282
Who are you people?

747
01:09:20,365 --> 01:09:23,076
Oh, who we are is of little consequence.

748
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:26,246
But a little bee told me

749
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:30,792
that you might be hiding
a few fugitives from justice.

750
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:32,586
Fugitives?

751
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,339
Yeah, well, you didn't think
they was real nuns, did you?

752
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:40,510
Oh, my word. Seems like someone
has been taking advantage

753
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:44,181
of the kindness
of a lonely, stupid old woman.

754
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:45,515
Ooh...

755
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,726
Nobody's here,
and if you don't leave,

756
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,519
I'm going to call the cops.

757
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:53,899
Since it appears
that you're at a loss for sight,

758
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:57,486
here's my blow... by blow!

759
01:09:59,154 --> 01:10:03,950
- Now, my associate, Tuff...
- Associate?

760
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:07,120
I'm sorry, I just want to be professional.

761
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:11,917
Oh. Okay. Fine.

762
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,338
- And now, my partner and paramour...
- Okay.

763
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:20,675
...Tuff, is standing right above you.

764
01:10:20,759 --> 01:10:24,638
He has a gun to your head.

765
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,391
And if you don't tell us
where those little bitches are

766
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,893
by the time I count to three,

767
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:34,564
he's going to blow your old,
rich brain out. One!

768
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:36,733
If it's money you want,
I have money.

769
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:40,404
It's not about money! Two!

770
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:42,155
Dear Lord Jesus,

771
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:46,118
- assign your spirit unto me.
- Three!

772
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,083
- It's the God squad, bitch!
- That's right.

773
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,046
Oh!

774
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:00,465
Tuff!

775
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:10,600
Tuff!

776
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,862
So you believe in Jesus?

777
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:26,658
Jesus is just a statue.

778
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:28,910
Go.

779
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,794
He's made as a cruel construct

780
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:40,338
by this old, white male,

781
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:45,844
who was so vulnerable, so weak.

782
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:50,265
You better keep me dead,
or I'm gonna sing.

783
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,143
<i>♪ Joy to the world ♪</i>

784
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,979
<i>♪ The nuns are fucked ♪</i>

785
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,899
Will you just shut the fuck up?!

786
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,286
<i>Okay, well, I'll admit,</i>

787
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:17,292
<i>maybe another one of those
potentially excessive overreactions.</i>

788
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,669
<i>But, hey, whatever.</i>

789
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:23,048
<i>It's just me over here
doing some of God's dirty work.</i>

790
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:27,594
<i>And, come on,
someone had to shut that bitch up.</i>

791
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:04,089
<i>Sunny invited us all to stay.</i>

792
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:08,301
<i>But if this was my first step
into my born again virginity,</i>

793
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:11,179
I wanted to start fresh across the board.

794
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:14,057
<i>That means saying goodbye to my girls.</i>

795
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,855
<i>Instead of turning everybody into
the police for impersonating nuns,</i>

796
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:23,984
<i>Sister Julie made them
pay penance to the church.</i>

797
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,405
<i>Which I hear is a pretty shit fine.</i>

798
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:35,245
<i>I also heard the church
got a new priest too.</i>

799
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:40,667
<i>Apparently, after our carnal encounter,
Father Sexy Pants had a crisis of faith.</i>

800
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,546
<i>He gave up the priesthood
and decided to take up male modeling.</i>

801
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:46,548
<i>Yeah, it really suits him too.</i>

802
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:48,675
<i>And, as for me...</i>

803
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:53,680
<i>Well, as for me,
you weren't done with me yet.</i>

804
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,978
<i>I don't know if the father
IS Eric, that priest,</i>

805
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:02,689
<i>or fuck, could be anyone else.</i>

806
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:06,443
<i>All know I is, sweet Lord Jesus,</i>

807
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,280
<i>You brought me to the City of Angels
for a purpose,</i>

808
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:14,242
<i>and now I'm off to spread Your light.</i>

809
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:21,666
I love you, Jesus!

810
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:26,755
JC's my man!
