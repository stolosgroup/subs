00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:10,707
<i>This is the
process of starting, simply enough.</i>

3
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,243
<i>It's gotta happen eventually,
but it might not be tomorrow.</i>

4
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:16,847
<i>Meanwhile, over on the west side of
the city, things were good for a bit,</i>

5
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,950
<i>and now we're starting to see the
beginnings of it here in Hell's Kitchen.</i>

6
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,968
Morning.

7
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:26,336
Hey.

8
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:32,075
- How was your weekend?
- It was all right, I guess.

9
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,914
Hey, the grosses,
we need them printed out,

10
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:40,216
maybe by rank
and also by market.

11
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,202
WME came back
with 250K and three points.

12
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:42,540
- Gross?
- Adjusted gross. We can get them down.

13
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:47,411
- I can check with biz affairs over there...
- What time is he in?

14
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,212
And we can't give him an "And."

15
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:51,047
- What?
- He can't get an "And."

16
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,583
He gets a single card.

17
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:55,051
I get it. I get it.

18
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,137
No bagels.

19
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,171
What'd you get?

20
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,076
Hey, check your in-box.

21
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:22,011
They want to
move the test screening up.

22
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,279
- Wait, Los Angeles?
- Yeah.

23
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,415
No. What?

24
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,018
Morning. His schedule.

25
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,153
How was your weekend?

26
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,088
Amazing. Yours?

27
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:33,457
I was here.

28
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,259
Oh, right.
Thanks for that.

29
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,130
Wait, what? Tomorrow?
We had it on the calendar for Friday.

30
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:46,269
Office of...
One moment, please.

31
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:48,506
- Office of the chairman.
- I have Tony on one.

32
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,341
- Let me see if I have...
- Office of...

33
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:53,811
I don't have him right now, but I'll
have him return as soon as possible.

34
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:55,245
I'm sorry,
I don't have him right now.

35
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:57,146
- Thank you.
- Is he in yet?

36
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,048
- No, not till 10:00.
- Look, we're all set

37
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:01,585
for Friday and... Okay. Okay.

38
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:05,355
He can leave tonight.
We'll clear his schedule.

39
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:07,525
I'll get her
into the travel now.

40
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:08,492
Okay, thanks.

41
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:16,132
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Gary. Hi. Just need a confirmation.

42
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:18,167
<i>Yep. It's right here in front of me.</i>

43
00:09:18,201 --> 00:09:20,437
Uh, yes, out of Teterboro
tonight at 11:00 p.m.

44
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:23,172
And what time does that
get him into Los Angeles?

45
00:09:23,574 --> 00:09:25,409
<i>Wheels down at 2:15.</i>

46
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,478
Okay, great.
And as of right now,

47
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,312
there are
two additional passengers.

48
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:31,247
- <i>All set.</i>
- Okay, great. Thank you.

49
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:32,282
<i>Thank you.</i>

50
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,293
Bill, hi. I'll need the suite ready
for tonight, plus two additional rooms.

51
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:46,296
- John, hi.
- <i>Hey.</i>

52
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:47,565
1:30 a.m., Van Nuys.

53
00:09:47,598 --> 00:09:50,166
<i>I'm not sure I can...</i>

54
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,437
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that?

55
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,706
Oh, okay, uh...

56
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,541
Well, how are you feeling now?

57
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:00,444
<i>I'm really not sure
I can tonight.</i>

58
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:03,112
Okay, I understand.
Don't worry. I'll sort it out.

59
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:05,315
<i>I'm just a little dizzy
and my stomach is...</i>

60
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:07,183
Okay, you look after yourself.

61
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:08,652
<i>Yeah, I'm definitely gonna
stay in bed.</i>

62
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,286
Okay. Take care.

63
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,622
I got your e-mail.

64
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,459
Well, what about the manuscript?

65
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:18,161
We know you have
the manuscript, right?

66
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:19,663
Hi, Javier.
John had to call in sick

67
00:10:19,697 --> 00:10:21,498
and we need a car
at Van Nuys at 1:30 a.m.

68
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,400
Oh. Okay.
Well, is it watermarked?

69
00:10:23,434 --> 00:10:24,602
<i>No. My daughter,
it's her quinceañera.</i>

70
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:29,372
- Jesus.
- Where are those new pages?

71
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:31,274
I want those new pages
before I get on the plane.

72
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:32,676
He promised them first thing.

73
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,379
Is there any way for you
to rearrange that?

74
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,280
Apparently HBO
didn't pick up her pilot.

75
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:39,248
- Where are we at?
- 200K and two points.

76
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:41,217
- We can get them down.
- That's bullshit.

77
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:48,425
- Sorry, what?
- <i>My brother can help. I'll be there.</i>

78
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:51,260
Okay. Great.
Thank you so much.

79
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:54,498
<i>Hang on. Let me get this down.
1:30 at Van Nuys.</i>

80
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:57,300
- <i>Then straight to the hotel?</i>
- Yes, straight to the hotel.

81
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,402
The Peninsula.

82
00:10:59,302 --> 00:11:00,269
Okay, thanks.

83
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:17,688
"Boom. Gunshot.

84
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:20,356
Bonnie has been shot through the back.
Her body lurches forward."

85
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:44,247
That script change
you wanted in the first act?

86
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,316
It has ripple effects
all the way down the line.

87
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,687
- Even Nick is saying it makes no sense.
- Hey.

88
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,192
The new draft.

89
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:03,332
She's gotta get out of here if
we're gonna get her to that screening.

90
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,244
What?

91
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,513
He wants you
on the Los Angeles trip.

92
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:18,716
When?

93
00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:19,817
Tonight.

94
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:21,452
Fuck.

95
00:12:22,786 --> 00:12:24,220
Have fun.

96
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:29,225
The car leaves at 9:00.
Wheels up at Teterboro at 11:00.

97
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,602
Does 6:00 p.m. work then?

98
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:44,742
Okay, great. Perfect.

99
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:47,778
And I'll shoot you an e-mail
with everything and the details.

100
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:49,680
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Okay, thank you.

101
00:13:02,358 --> 00:13:04,728
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, we spoke earlier.

102
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:08,465
Listen, his schedule has shifted
and he no longer has the afternoon.

103
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:10,299
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Does 7:00 p.m. work?

104
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,736
<i>Yeah, I can do 7:00 p.m.</i>

105
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,871
Great.

106
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,774
Perfect.

107
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,510
- <i>Still at the hotel, or...</i>
- Yes.

108
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,545
- The Peninsula. Beverly Hills.
- <i>Okay.</i>

109
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,648
<i>Will I be able
to find him easily?</i>

110
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:28,385
Yes, yes. There is a
restaurant inside the hotel.

111
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:30,420
<i>Cool. Um, where do I park?</i>

112
00:13:47,137 --> 00:13:48,572
Ow.

113
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:41,752
- What?
- Can you deal with this?

114
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:43,854
- Wh... What is it?
- The wife.

115
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:45,722
Why me?

116
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:49,660
Fine.

117
00:15:53,764 --> 00:15:56,700
- Hello?
- <i>He blocked the cards again.</i>

118
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:59,002
- Sorry?
- <i>The credit cards. They're blocked.</i>

119
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,704
- <i>All of them.</i>
- They're blocked?

120
00:16:00,737 --> 00:16:01,972
<i>He must have canceled them.</i>

121
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:07,477
I'm... Surely not.
Let me get in touch with the bank. It's...

122
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:09,880
<i>It's not the bank. It's him.
He's doing this.</i>

123
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,851
I mean, you have
your personal cards, right?

124
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:17,054
<i>That's not the point.
You're not listening to me.</i>

125
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:19,990
I... I really think
that this is a misunderstanding.

126
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,793
<i>Are you listening to me?
You're not listening to what I'm saying.</i>

127
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:24,962
No, I am. I'm just...
I'm trying to help.

128
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:27,531
<i>Why is he doing this to me? Why?</i>

129
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:30,834
I really don't... Uh...

130
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,670
<i>Why is he doing this to me?</i>

131
00:16:33,704 --> 00:16:35,672
- Uh...
- <i>He can't treat me like this.</i>

132
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:39,643
Are you... Are you still there?

133
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,883
<i>Now what did you say to her?</i>

134
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,686
<i>What did you say...
What the fuck did you say to her?</i>

135
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,889
<i>Filling her head with this
bullshit is not your job.</i>

136
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:29,026
<i>I thought the last girl was bad,
but you have somehow</i>

137
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:30,794
- <i>lowered the bar even further.</i>
- Hey, how'd it go?

138
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:32,896
<i>They told me you were smart.</i>

139
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:36,900
- <i>Act like it.</i>
- No way! Oh! That is awesome.

140
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,102
<i>Go back to the one thing you're good at.
Ordering salads.</i>

141
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,771
Yeah.

142
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:43,173
- <i>Focus on that.</i>
- I'm sorry.

143
00:17:43,206 --> 00:17:44,741
<i>Don't waste my time.</i>

144
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,820
You should add, "I appreciate the
opportunity to work for this company

145
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,588
and will not
let you down again."

146
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:34,691
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course.

147
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:01,885
They're begging us for
three more weeks, but I don't see...

148
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:05,655
...soft money out of the fund
over there.

149
00:19:05,689 --> 00:19:08,158
We've got all that money
sitting in Cologne... like, two million.

150
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:11,128
I don't think we can push more than
a week. Can you get into it with them?

151
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,063
I can try. But who knows?

152
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,881
- Mom?
- <i>What? I can't hear you.</i>

153
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:33,283
Mom. Can you...
Can you hear me now?

154
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:36,052
<i>Well, where are you?
Shouldn't you be at work?</i>

155
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:38,822
- I'm at work.
- <i>In the office?</i>

156
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:41,158
Yeah, of course.
Of course I'm at the office.

157
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:44,661
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- Well, I don't... Nothing.

158
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,665
<i>Are you okay?</i>

159
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,735
Yeah, I'm fine.

160
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:53,069
<i>It was your father's birthday
yesterday.</i>

161
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:58,975
<i>He knows you're busy. Maybe call him
tonight though, if you get the chance.</i>

162
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:02,846
I... I will.

163
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:05,215
I don't know, for some reason
I thought it was tomorrow.

164
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:07,918
<i>He knows you're busy, sweetie.</i>

165
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:52,729
Excuse me.

166
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,953
Possibly.
What was this regarding?

167
00:21:18,888 --> 00:21:20,156
Okay, one moment. I'll check.

168
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,342
Sorry. Which carrier?

169
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,145
I'm sorry. Can you spell that?

170
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:44,814
He'll be just a moment.

171
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:47,083
- What?
- Uh, just a moment.

172
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:49,886
- What?
- Uh, Tony is on the line.

173
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,023
He wants to discuss this week's theater
expansion. Should I put him through?

174
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:55,292
I don't need the details.
Just have him e-mail me.

175
00:21:55,325 --> 00:21:56,359
- Okay.
- We're done.

176
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:07,003
Send her in.

177
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:09,806
Okay, you can come through.

178
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,156
- Uh, this way. Yeah.
- Oh.

179
00:22:39,002 --> 00:22:41,071
Do you think you could
make that work on your side?

180
00:22:41,104 --> 00:22:42,440
If so,
I'll make it work on ours.

181
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:47,411
Yeah.

182
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,279
Yes, get back to me. Thank you.

183
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:05,995
Thank you.

184
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:18,007
Hey.

185
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:20,310
He... He just stepped out.

186
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:23,913
Uh, he's in the screening room.

187
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:28,184
I'm not sure.

188
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:32,989
Listen, drop by at 3:00.
He may have a window from 3:00 to 4:00.

189
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:36,226
I mean, I can't promise
anything, but I'll try and get you in.

190
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:41,297
Great. Thanks, man.
Catch you later.

191
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,017
This is turkey. I said chicken.

192
00:24:02,352 --> 00:24:03,421
Forget it.

193
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,177
- Office of the...
- <i>Does he have a moment?</i>

194
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,181
Yes, certainly. I can put you
straight through. One moment.

195
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:32,516
Hey.

196
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,051
Oh, no. Not again.

197
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:40,056
You're on.

198
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:42,493
Oh, wow.

199
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:45,396
- Who is it?
- Shh, shh.

200
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:52,001
Oh, my God.

201
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:54,103
Oh, wow.

202
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:59,075
Oh! Huh.

203
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,386
Brutal. Brutal.

204
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:14,257
No.

205
00:25:35,546 --> 00:25:38,147
How do I get out of unscripted?

206
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:39,450
I'm serious.

207
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:43,052
- Have you spoken to Jonathan?
- In production?

208
00:25:43,086 --> 00:25:44,488
Yeah.

209
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:45,656
I heard
he wants to leave.

210
00:25:45,689 --> 00:25:48,124
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

211
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:50,193
Maybe he can put in
a good word for you.

212
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:51,294
You never know.

213
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:56,199
No, he'll hire externally.
There's no way he's going to move me over.

214
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:23,192
Uh...

215
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:33,437
What's happened? Where'd he go?

216
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,271
Huh?

217
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:47,083
<i>Sí.</i> Yeah.

218
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:57,628
Uh...

219
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,199
No, no, no. It's... It's not...
It's not your fault. It's...

220
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:06,470
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- It's not your fault. Um, I'll fix it.

221
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:09,440
Uh...

222
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:16,380
I'm sorry.
Who are you looking for?

223
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:19,248
No, I don't think
she works here anymore.

224
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:21,351
Um, hang on one second.
Please hold.

225
00:27:31,662 --> 00:27:32,763
Hi.

226
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:35,699
Uh, hi.
It's... This is yours.

227
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:40,471
Um, it's... Um...

228
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,408
Thanks.

229
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:55,519
Yes. Okay.

230
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,698
Yes, he wanted to make
sure Brian got the invitation.

231
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:14,170
Of course, any donation will be
appreciated, but the seats are comped.

232
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:19,275
Thanks.

233
00:29:03,352 --> 00:29:05,321
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi, it's me again.

234
00:29:05,354 --> 00:29:07,725
Yes. The last two checks
don't have a name or anything,

235
00:29:07,758 --> 00:29:09,693
just the dollar amount.

236
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:11,528
<i>Uh, ignore it.</i>

237
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:13,530
Okay. And will he know
what it's for?

238
00:29:13,564 --> 00:29:14,565
<i>Yeah.</i>

239
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,501
Okay.

240
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,570
<i>He'll know.</i>

241
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:20,704
Okay, sure. Thank you.

242
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:45,662
Let's go.

243
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,701
Can you watch him
for a second?

244
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:51,735
Yep.

245
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,607
Hey.

246
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:01,344
- What's that?
- Your s... suit.

247
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:03,380
I don't need this suit.

248
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:06,416
They misplaced the DCP.

249
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:09,419
- Wait. What?
- It hasn't arrived yet.

250
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:12,355
- Well, isn't there a tracking number?
- I'll get them on the phone.

251
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:13,624
He's gonna freak.

252
00:30:16,593 --> 00:30:19,863
Hey.
You do not bring the kids here.

253
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:26,703
Jesus Christ.

254
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,739
Now you do it.

255
00:31:10,547 --> 00:31:11,481
Louder!

256
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:36,673
Hey.

257
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:38,508
Hi.

258
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:59,750
No, he threw that one
on Weekend Read.

259
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:03,587
Um, Friday.

260
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:10,027
Mm. I don't know. Let me check.

261
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:21,004
Well, get back to me. Yeah?

262
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:22,839
Thanks.

263
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:45,929
But when was it
supposed to arrive?

264
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,136
- Hi.
- <i>The new assistant is here.</i>

265
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:58,809
- What address do you have?
- Okay, uh, hang on.

266
00:34:58,842 --> 00:35:01,578
Right. I'm not sure
what happened there. Um...

267
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:06,149
- Sorry, who?
- Okay. Let me check on that. I'll get back to you.

268
00:35:06,183 --> 00:35:08,386
<i>A girl.
She says she starts today.</i>

269
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:11,721
Uh, hey.
There's a girl waiting at reception.

270
00:35:11,755 --> 00:35:14,157
She says that she's supposed
to start here today.

271
00:35:14,191 --> 00:35:16,026
Working here? With us?
Where's she from?

272
00:35:17,928 --> 00:35:18,995
Where's she from?

273
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,864
<i>Idaho.</i>

274
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,633
- Idaho.
- Idaho?

275
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,937
Is that the one he met
in Sun Valley?

276
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,910
Oh, her. She's been here before.
A few times. Uh, send her in.

277
00:35:44,154 --> 00:35:45,088
Send her in.

278
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,168
- Can I?
- Yeah, take one.

279
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:00,003
Cool.

280
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:09,179
Thanks. Okay.

281
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,782
So, here and here.

282
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:15,152
And this one here.

283
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:21,992
Here and here. Initial here.
Sign there.

284
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:24,928
Thanks.

285
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,032
Do I need a...

286
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,734
Do I need a lawyer
or something?

287
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:32,802
Do you have a lawyer?

288
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:47,083
Is it nice?

289
00:36:49,953 --> 00:36:50,954
Sorry?

290
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:53,890
The hotel.

291
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:55,025
Oh. Yeah.

292
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:56,993
Cool.

293
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:00,830
- It's really nice. Yeah.
- Oh.

294
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:03,733
Is this where they put
you when you started?

295
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:06,102
- No.
- Oh.

296
00:37:07,037 --> 00:37:08,305
Where'd they put you?

297
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,875
Um, they didn't.

298
00:37:15,078 --> 00:37:16,112
Oh.

299
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,787
So, you're from Idaho,
right?

300
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:27,157
Yeah. Um, Boise.

301
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,125
You been?

302
00:37:29,993 --> 00:37:31,795
Mm-mmm. No.

303
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:32,862
There's not much to see.

304
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:38,868
So, did you...
did you come straight from there, or...

305
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:43,974
Yeah. I mean, there was this whole
conference thing a while back.

306
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:46,142
- I was working there.
- Oh, okay.

307
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:49,012
Yeah. Just waitressing.
But I've worked in film before.

308
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,148
- Oh.
- Yeah.

309
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,150
I did some work
on this movie

310
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,852
that shot in
Salt Lake City, so...

311
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,021
I know a bit.

312
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:04,227
My uncle
is in craft services.

313
00:38:15,606 --> 00:38:17,974
Yeah, but the sub log says
it came in to her.

314
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,178
It didn't?
I'm looking at it right now.

315
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:24,981
It's right in front of me.

316
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:28,084
No, he hasn't seen it yet.

317
00:38:31,221 --> 00:38:34,824
Well, then you should change the sub
log, because if he sees that...

318
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,895
Yep.

319
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:42,759
Goldman hasn’t sent the revised deck.

320
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:45,971
They said he wants to add four more films.
And talk about the library

321
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:49,599
I haven’t had a chance
to revise the report.

322
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,353
But he can add ten more films,
the problem is...

323
00:38:53,603 --> 00:38:56,023
the domestic marketing. And of course,
the overhead fee.

324
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:57,930
The talent pool.

325
00:38:58,013 --> 00:38:59,266
He still insists on a gross fee

326
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,117
for the executive producer fees.

327
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:02,905
But we will be executive producers, no?

328
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:05,824
But not included in the pool,
according to…

329
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:13,916
And what happened
to the release requirement?

330
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:15,542
Still holding at 100 screens.

331
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,503
- We told them we need a thousand.
- I know.

332
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,425
Hi.

333
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:44,060
Hi.

334
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:49,065
Um, his three o'clock is here.

335
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:55,473
Where is he?

336
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:57,941
Uh, he's in a personal.

337
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:31,374
Understand Mr. Li had
agreed to remain this extra day

338
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:34,043
in the hopes that we could come
to some general agreement.

339
00:40:34,077 --> 00:40:37,347
- Again, I sincerely apologize.
- We will need to address all these issues another time.

340
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:40,150
Absolutely. Again,
I apologize for the miscommunication.

341
00:40:40,183 --> 00:40:42,486
I will have the office reach
out to you as soon as possible.

342
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,187
I can't thank you enough for...

343
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,933
What?

344
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:00,236
She wants you.

345
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,007
Just say he's in
an important meeting.

346
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,141
He'll get back to her
as soon as he can.

347
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:07,076
No, say he's in a screening.

348
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,446
Something that isn't
so easy to interrupt.

349
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:11,047
I'm not gonna lie to her.

350
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,422
- Hi.
- <i>Where is he?</i>

351
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:21,759
I'm sorry,
but I don't have him right now.

352
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:24,528
<i>Oh, right. Where is he?</i>

353
00:41:24,562 --> 00:41:28,298
Uh, I... I'm not sure.
I don't have him right now.

354
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,134
- <i>Who is he with?</i>
- I... I can get...

355
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:34,103
<i>Just tell me where he is
and who he is with.</i>

356
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:35,473
- I... I... I'm not...
- <i>Just where and who.</i>

357
00:41:35,506 --> 00:41:37,273
I really don't know.
I don't have him.

358
00:41:37,307 --> 00:41:38,576
- I'm so...
- <i>Fine.</i>

359
00:42:57,488 --> 00:42:59,490
Well, I promise
to give you a 15-minute warning

360
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:00,658
before he walks
into your office.

361
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,460
That's the best I can do.

362
00:43:05,563 --> 00:43:07,531
Okay. Catch you later.

363
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,501
I don't know about
that final scene.

364
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,570
Let's just see
what he has to say.

365
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:14,170
- Has he got the latest draft?
- Yeah.

366
00:43:14,203 --> 00:43:15,472
I thought
there was comp coverage.

367
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,441
It's just
the last two scenes.

368
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:19,309
And the flashback?

369
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:20,511
Gone. Right?

370
00:43:20,544 --> 00:43:21,879
I wouldn't sit there.

371
00:43:21,912 --> 00:43:23,714
Never sit on the couch.

372
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:28,351
Hello! Where is he?

373
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:34,190
Uh, where'd you take her?

374
00:43:34,223 --> 00:43:36,560
- What?
- The girl. Where'd you take her?

375
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:38,294
The Mark.

376
00:43:39,262 --> 00:43:40,229
The Mark.

377
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:48,171
- It's like that time in Cannes.
- That was in London, dude.

378
00:43:48,204 --> 00:43:49,673
I would remember where it was.
It was Cannes.

379
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:51,675
Seriously,
you would not remember,

380
00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:54,411
given how late to the du Cap
you and what's-his-name were.

381
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:57,448
- Who is... Who is this?
- It was Cannes! Jeffrey was there, remember?

382
00:43:58,515 --> 00:44:00,149
I'm sure we can add her.

383
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:03,487
And for the auction, yeah.

384
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:09,426
Uh, yes, a lunch
and a script consultation.

385
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:12,596
Yes, in New York.

386
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:19,369
Uh, okay. Let me ask him and I
will get back to you. Okay. Thanks.

387
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:48,399
He won't make it to the theater
in time. Should we just cancel or...

388
00:44:48,432 --> 00:44:51,367
- It starts at 7:30.
- Okay, he's not going to be happy.

389
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,738
We could push for an earlier
wheels-up, but we'd have to...

390
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:56,507
Shoot him an e-mail,
see if you get a response.

391
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,292
Can I help you?

392
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:50,828
Uh, no, I just work
in the other building.

393
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:19,556
Hi. I was wondering
if someone's free.

394
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,627
- I remember you. I did your onboarding.
- Oh, yeah.

395
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:25,562
I don't see anything on
the books with you, though.

396
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:28,297
Uh, no.

397
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,402
Okay. Have a seat.
There's a chair over there.

398
00:46:33,403 --> 00:46:34,404
Thank you.

399
00:46:43,781 --> 00:46:45,348
He's in there. Just go in.

400
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:50,654
Here it is.
There isn't much there.

401
00:47:01,832 --> 00:47:03,600
- If Don calls, let me know.
- Of course.

402
00:47:14,878 --> 00:47:16,547
- He can see you now.
- Oh. Thank you.

403
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:48,612
- Welcome. Have a seat.
- Hi.

404
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:00,390
Did you want to
take your coat off?

405
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:02,793
Uh...

406
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,429
Uh, no. No, it's okay.

407
00:48:08,498 --> 00:48:09,833
Actually, maybe just my scarf.

408
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,772
Yeah.
Looks more comfortable.

409
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:21,812
Um...

410
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:25,482
I... I didn't know
who to come to.

411
00:48:25,515 --> 00:48:28,452
In that case,
you came to the right place. So...

412
00:48:32,823 --> 00:48:35,759
- I mean, it's just. It's just...
- Hey.

413
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:38,528
Whatever's going on, you can tell me.
That's what I'm here for.

414
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,703
Um, there's this girl
who arrived today.

415
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:49,840
She...

416
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:52,576
She's from Boise.

417
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:54,912
Mm-hmm. Okay.

418
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:57,648
And she's very pretty.

419
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:00,951
- And she's young.
- Okay.

420
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:05,555
She was waitressing in Sun
Valley when she met him.

421
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:08,725
And he just liked her,
apparently,

422
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:10,928
and just gave her
an assistant job.

423
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:13,597
And?

424
00:49:15,732 --> 00:49:20,237
Well, she doesn't have any
experience, or not much experience,

425
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:22,973
and he just flew her over from Boise
and is putting her up at a hotel?

426
00:49:32,749 --> 00:49:34,685
She's very young.

427
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,820
Is she too young
to be an assistant?

428
00:49:36,853 --> 00:49:39,690
No. No, no. Uh...

429
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:43,593
Well, okay, um...

430
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:52,636
And this girl, has she done
something to make you... uh...

431
00:49:52,669 --> 00:49:54,972
Do you suspect that she's done
something to harm the company?

432
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:59,810
No. No, no, no. I mean, I don't...
I don't think so.

433
00:49:59,843 --> 00:50:03,914
I dropped her off at The Mark,
the hotel.

434
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:07,884
- Uh-huh.
- We had a reservation for her and I left her there.

435
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:10,554
- Yes.
- And when I came back to the office...

436
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:12,789
he was... he was gone.

437
00:50:15,959 --> 00:50:17,694
And he was gone
for quite a while.

438
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:19,963
And you were
looking for him?

439
00:50:19,997 --> 00:50:23,967
No, he was just...
he was gone and she was gone

440
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:26,103
and they were both
at The Mark apparently.

441
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:27,537
Apparently?

442
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:31,708
I mean,
that's what everyone said.

443
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:33,310
Who said?

444
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:37,781
Um, the...
the production executives...

445
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:40,050
and all the assistants.

446
00:50:41,985 --> 00:50:44,621
- I mean, they were just laughing about it.
- They were laughing?

447
00:50:45,922 --> 00:50:47,024
Yeah.

448
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:52,896
Okay, maybe let's back up here a bit.
What did she say to you?

449
00:50:53,797 --> 00:50:54,931
- Who?
- The girl.

450
00:50:56,066 --> 00:50:57,701
The girl?

451
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:59,636
Uh... Nothing.

452
00:50:59,669 --> 00:51:01,838
Nothing?
Have you spoken to her?

453
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:05,942
No. I mean, just in the cab
on our way to The Mark.

454
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:08,578
But I haven't
talked to her since.

455
00:51:08,612 --> 00:51:11,048
- Since when?
- I haven't seen her since.

456
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:13,150
When I found out,
I came straight here.

457
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:15,052
Sorry. What did you...
what did you find out?

458
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,693
What... What can we do?

459
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:27,097
Do about what?

460
00:51:32,235 --> 00:51:33,670
About the girl.

461
00:51:34,905 --> 00:51:36,073
Okay, let's...

462
00:51:38,141 --> 00:51:42,846
Bear with me here. So,
a new assistant arrives from out of town,

463
00:51:42,879 --> 00:51:45,082
- and she's being put up at The Mark...
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:47,017
...and your boss at some point
left the office.

465
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,052
To meet her at The Mark, yes.

466
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,987
Yes, according, apparently,
to the jokes at the office.

467
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:55,926
- Yeah, I guess, yeah.
- Okay.

468
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:58,829
Okay, so that's...
that's it?

469
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:02,032
That's why you came in?

470
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:12,109
And... And I found...
an earring.

471
00:52:12,142 --> 00:52:13,844
- In the office today.
- An earring?

472
00:52:15,145 --> 00:52:16,179
By his couch.

473
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:20,717
- And a hair tie on the floor last week.
- Ah.

474
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:26,223
Forgive me, but are you often,
um, cleaning things off his floor?

475
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:28,158
I mean, we have a janitorial
crew, right?

476
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,093
I'm supposed to tidy up.

477
00:52:32,896 --> 00:52:35,632
And... And a girl came
and... and...

478
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,002
she picked the earring up.

479
00:52:39,035 --> 00:52:41,171
I've never seen her before,
and it was hers.

480
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:44,040
Okay.

481
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:47,978
Sorry.

482
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:50,981
Just a sec.

483
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:55,085
Hey.

484
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:57,821
No. No need.
We're fine, really.

485
00:52:59,956 --> 00:53:00,957
What?

486
00:53:05,762 --> 00:53:07,898
You think I give a shit
about the Rangers?

487
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:12,736
Yeah.

488
00:53:14,104 --> 00:53:15,672
All right,
we'll pick this up later.

489
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:18,909
Okay.

490
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:25,015
Sorry about that. Uh...

491
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:29,252
Where were we?

492
00:53:33,023 --> 00:53:33,990
The earring.

493
00:53:39,796 --> 00:53:42,199
Okay, listen,
you're relatively new to the company.

494
00:53:42,232 --> 00:53:44,502
I mean, I've been working
here for nearly two months.

495
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,203
Five weeks.

496
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:48,338
- Well, yeah.
- And you're under a lot of stress.

497
00:53:48,371 --> 00:53:50,974
Entry-level jobs in this
industry are tough, right?

498
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:52,876
Long hours?

499
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:56,079
- Yeah...
- First one in. Last one out.

500
00:53:56,112 --> 00:53:58,114
- Well, yeah.
- I bet you haven't seen your friends in a while.

501
00:54:00,283 --> 00:54:03,954
Um, I... I missed
my dad's birthday.

502
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:04,988
That's tough.

503
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:10,327
- Yeah, but that's...
- Where'd you go to college?

504
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:14,297
- Uh, Northwestern.
- It's a great school.

505
00:54:14,331 --> 00:54:16,166
It's a great school.
You're smart.

506
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:17,934
You have to be smart
to get into Northwestern.

507
00:54:17,968 --> 00:54:19,769
Plus a 3.8 GPA.

508
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:25,208
And you're on a fast track in this
business, working here. You are.

509
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:27,043
So, what's your plan?

510
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:31,781
- Sorry?
- Where do you want to be in five to ten years?

511
00:54:31,815 --> 00:54:35,118
Oh. Uh, I want to produce.
I want to be a producer.

512
00:54:35,151 --> 00:54:36,953
- You do?
- Yeah.

513
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:39,256
Okay, that's excellent.

514
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:42,859
We could use more women producers.
It's a tough job.

515
00:54:44,595 --> 00:54:46,296
But I can see
that you've got what it takes.

516
00:54:48,965 --> 00:54:49,899
Thanks.

517
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:56,840
So why are you in here trying to
throw it all away over this bullshit?

518
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:02,312
- Sorry?
- This.

519
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:05,982
Whatever it is.

520
00:55:07,418 --> 00:55:09,219
Let's make it official.
Call it a complaint.

521
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:11,054
Let's assume I were to
do you the disservice

522
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:12,889
of writing it up for you.

523
00:55:12,922 --> 00:55:15,158
So, your complaint
is as follows.

524
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:18,194
The company hires
a new assistant.

525
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:20,964
She's young and, in your
opinion, she's very pretty.

526
00:55:20,997 --> 00:55:23,401
- And she's maybe a little inexperienced.
- She's a waitress.

527
00:55:23,434 --> 00:55:26,836
Exactly. And they possibly
offered her a job just like that

528
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:29,205
and they're putting her up
in a fancy hotel.

529
00:55:29,239 --> 00:55:30,974
And you live...
Where do you live?

530
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:33,977
Astoria.

531
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,945
Astoria?

532
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:40,283
Okay. I understand.

533
00:55:40,317 --> 00:55:41,985
- That's not the point.
- And by the way,

534
00:55:42,018 --> 00:55:44,054
how experienced were you
when you got hired?

535
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:46,424
Couple of internships?
Am I right?

536
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:50,126
- The last one paid me.
- Do you know how many people work at this company?

537
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,128
I have to make sure all
of them are taken care of.

538
00:55:52,162 --> 00:55:53,997
And do you know how many
people want to work here?

539
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,335
I've got 400 résumés teed up
for your position alone.

540
00:55:58,368 --> 00:56:02,005
Ivy League grads,
4.0 GPAs.

541
00:56:02,038 --> 00:56:04,307
And here you are sitting in my
office, stressed out,

542
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:09,145
jealous of some new assistant who's
getting more attention than you.

543
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:11,181
I'm not... I'm not jealous.

544
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:14,317
I was just...
I was worried for this girl.

545
00:56:14,351 --> 00:56:17,320
She's a woman.
She's a grown woman.

546
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:20,890
- Sorry, yes.
- You think a grown woman can't make her own choices?

547
00:56:20,924 --> 00:56:22,959
- I never said that.
- Because she's a waitress?

548
00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:25,396
- Nope, I didn't say that.
- What then? What then?

549
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:26,930
Listen, honestly...

550
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:30,300
what do you want from me?

551
00:56:36,072 --> 00:56:39,142
- I just...
- Tell me what you want me to do here.

552
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:44,382
Do you want to
keep working here?

553
00:56:44,415 --> 00:56:46,015
I do. I...

554
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:57,994
Look, frankly,
it's your call.

555
00:56:58,027 --> 00:57:00,230
I could file a complaint for
you if that's what you want.

556
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:03,967
But I think you know
how it would come off.

557
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:13,176
Should I file this?

558
00:57:24,422 --> 00:57:25,389
No, don't.

559
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,291
Okay.

560
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:36,500
Okay.

561
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:39,969
Okay. Thank you.

562
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:43,139
Don't forget your scarf.

563
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,409
Thank you.

564
00:57:48,412 --> 00:57:51,181
I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

565
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:52,982
Hmm?

566
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,286
You're not his type.

567
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:17,233
Yeah, that's an IT thing.
I don't know.

568
00:59:26,142 --> 00:59:27,611
You know you can always come to
us, right?

569
00:59:31,582 --> 00:59:33,049
Come to us first, okay?

570
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,199
It's for you.

571
00:59:53,504 --> 00:59:55,071
You better get it.

572
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:02,546
<i>I'm not gonna yell at you.
Am I yelling? No.</i>

573
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,416
<i>Because you're not someone
even worthy of that.</i>

574
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,320
<i>Because you didn't even have the
fucking courtesy to talk to me</i>

575
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:13,189
<i>about whatever the fuck fantasy
you decided to spew all over me.</i>

576
01:00:13,222 --> 01:00:16,560
<i>So, let me ask,
do you want to keep this job?</i>

577
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:20,397
Yeah.

578
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:22,131
<i>Okay.</i>

579
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:26,169
<i>Then send me a fucking apology.</i>

580
01:01:14,551 --> 01:01:15,619
I overreacted.

581
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:21,659
It was not my place
to question your decisions.

582
01:01:21,692 --> 01:01:23,192
Yeah, good.
That's good.

583
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:32,636
I appreciate
the continued opportunity

584
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:35,204
- to work with you...
- ...continued opportunity to work with you...

585
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:36,573
...and will not
let you down again.

586
01:01:38,542 --> 01:01:39,543
...again.

587
01:04:18,702 --> 01:04:19,636
Hi.

588
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:23,372
Hi.

589
01:04:27,878 --> 01:04:29,446
You, um...

590
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:31,915
They, um, gave me this desk.

591
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:33,617
They said
you'd teach me the phones.

592
01:04:41,558 --> 01:04:42,559
Okay, sure.

593
01:04:44,628 --> 01:04:45,996
Are you okay?

594
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,764
I can't figure out
how to dial out.

595
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:50,601
Oh. Nine-one to dial out.

596
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:03,881
So, the extensions
are marked here.

597
01:05:03,914 --> 01:05:07,484
One is his cell.
Two is his home in the Village.

598
01:05:07,517 --> 01:05:10,721
Three is his home in Connecticut.
He's there most weekends.

599
01:05:10,754 --> 01:05:12,990
Four is Amagansett,
the Hamptons,

600
01:05:13,023 --> 01:05:15,192
but you'll only need that
for the summer.

601
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:17,794
And then five is his wife.

602
01:05:18,862 --> 01:05:21,698
Six is his wife's assistant.

603
01:05:21,732 --> 01:05:24,868
Seven is Amir, his driver.

604
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:26,904
And then
president of distribution,

605
01:05:26,937 --> 01:05:30,540
president of marketing
and president of production.

606
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:32,542
Okay.

607
01:05:34,645 --> 01:05:37,681
And here is the LA office.

608
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:40,717
And here's the London office.

609
01:06:02,706 --> 01:06:03,774
- Amir?
- <i>Yes.</i>

610
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:07,844
- You're outside, right?
- <i>Yes. Out front. I'm waiting.</i>

611
01:06:08,779 --> 01:06:10,614
He's in a meeting.

612
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:12,549
<i>The traffic is no good.
I told them that.</i>

613
01:06:12,582 --> 01:06:14,885
- <i>When will he be done?</i>
- I have no idea.

614
01:06:14,918 --> 01:06:17,020
<i>There's construction in the
tunnel so we need to hurry it up.</i>

615
01:06:17,054 --> 01:06:20,691
I don't... I don't care.
I don't care.

616
01:06:20,724 --> 01:06:23,493
Just... You're ready to go
when he is, right?

617
01:06:23,527 --> 01:06:24,861
<i>Yes. Of course.</i>

618
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,663
Okay.
So that's all I need to know.

619
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:43,513
Sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean that.

620
01:06:43,547 --> 01:06:45,482
It's... It's been a long day.

621
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:51,788
<i>You work hard.
He respects you for that.</i>

622
01:06:54,024 --> 01:06:55,993
- He said that?
- <i>Yes.</i>

623
01:06:56,026 --> 01:06:58,962
<i>He told me you're smart.
Very smart.</i>

624
01:07:04,034 --> 01:07:05,602
Thanks, but...

625
01:07:07,938 --> 01:07:09,573
But, uh... Thanks.

626
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:12,909
<i>Okay, I'll be waiting.</i>

627
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:14,978
Thank you.

628
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,731
You can go if you want.

629
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:39,636
Oh. Thanks.

630
01:07:51,148 --> 01:07:54,584
- I, uh... Should I leave these?
- Oh, yeah. You can just leave them.

631
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,089
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

632
01:08:18,108 --> 01:08:19,142
Where to?

633
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:20,877
Willy's?

634
01:08:20,911 --> 01:08:22,813
Dahlia's? I need to eat.

635
01:08:22,846 --> 01:08:24,714
- I need to drink.
- I hear that.

636
01:08:25,682 --> 01:08:26,750
Come through this way.

637
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:31,922
I brought this along.

638
01:08:31,955 --> 01:08:33,857
Sure.

639
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:35,959
I just threw it together myself.
It's pretty lo-fi.

640
01:08:35,992 --> 01:08:37,160
Great.
Pack it for the trip.

641
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:41,832
We currently have 30 projects
in development,

642
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:43,667
some of which
will go in the next year.

643
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,202
Hi.

644
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:50,740
- Did you get a car?
- Yep, downstairs.

645
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,110
Hey. Dahlia's?

646
01:08:57,448 --> 01:08:59,149
I'm not
waiting around for that.

647
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:24,908
- You've been to France?
- Uh, no, I haven't.

648
01:09:32,782 --> 01:09:33,783
Is this for LA?

649
01:09:34,751 --> 01:09:35,752
Yes.

650
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:42,092
Who was that?

651
01:09:43,894 --> 01:09:44,928
Oh, that?

652
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:47,931
A waste of my time.

653
01:10:55,566 --> 01:10:57,267
<i>Okay.</i>

654
01:10:59,869 --> 01:11:02,973
<i>That woman before
asked me what your name was.</i>

655
01:11:03,006 --> 01:11:04,908
<i>And I didn't know
what to tell her.</i>

656
01:11:05,576 --> 01:11:08,078
<i>I didn't know whether to say...</i>

657
01:11:09,413 --> 01:11:11,314
<i>"It's David."</i>

658
01:11:11,348 --> 01:11:14,050
<i>Whether to say your name like
that straightaway, because...</i>

659
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:18,788
<i>I don't know. It might've seemed
like you were too familiar.</i>

660
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:25,128
<i>And I didn't know
if she was asking</i>

661
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:31,001
<i>in that way, or if she was
asking in that other way.</i>

662
01:11:31,034 --> 01:11:34,137
<i>The way that I imagine that
people whisper to one another</i>

663
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,974
<i>when they see you
walking down a hallway,</i>

664
01:11:38,008 --> 01:11:40,143
<i>or checking your e-mail
at a traffic light.</i>

665
01:11:43,614 --> 01:11:46,349
<i>"Is that that professor?"</i>

666
01:11:52,289 --> 01:11:54,357
<i>Mm.</i>

667
01:11:56,394 --> 01:11:58,928
<i>What did you say?</i>

668
01:11:58,962 --> 01:12:00,997
<i>I told her I didn't know
what your name was.</i>

669
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,303
<i>I told her
I didn't really know you.</i>

670
01:12:20,384 --> 01:12:21,985
That's for Los Angeles.

671
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:23,153
Okay, sure.

672
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:25,889
Schedule?

673
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:52,949
You forgot the power cord
for the DVD player.

674
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:50,206
- Yeah?
- <i>I don't need you. You can go...</i>

675
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:54,177
I can go?

676
01:14:00,283 --> 01:14:01,485
Hello?

677
01:14:29,179 --> 01:14:30,280
Has he left yet?

678
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:33,451
No.

679
01:16:06,877 --> 01:16:08,612
Don't worry.

680
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:10,581
She'll get more out
of it than he will.

681
01:16:11,482 --> 01:16:12,583
Trust me.

682
01:16:18,656 --> 01:16:19,623
Good night.

683
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:21,425
Good night.

684
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:35,426
<i>Hello?</i>

685
01:18:35,459 --> 01:18:36,560
Happy birthday, Daddy.

686
01:18:36,593 --> 01:18:38,562
<i>Hey! Well, thank you.</i>

687
01:18:38,595 --> 01:18:42,298
<i>It was a good day.
Quiet, but good.</i>

688
01:18:42,331 --> 01:18:45,769
I'm... I'm so sorry
I didn't call you.

689
01:18:45,803 --> 01:18:49,006
I just... I've...
I... It's been busy.

690
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:51,542
<i>Of course. I understand.</i>

691
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:53,477
<i>It's a great opportunity
you have there.</i>

692
01:18:54,878 --> 01:18:56,345
<i>We're excited for you.</i>

693
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:58,415
Thank you.

694
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,785
<i>So, well, how's it going?</i>

695
01:19:03,554 --> 01:19:05,756
<i>Your mom and I
want to know everything.</i>

696
01:19:06,623 --> 01:19:08,324
<i>Are you having fun?</i>

697
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:12,261
Um... It's okay. It's, uh...

698
01:19:12,295 --> 01:19:15,231
You know, it's just, like,
long hours and...

699
01:19:16,767 --> 01:19:19,536
- It's just stressful, you know?
- <i>Oh.</i>

700
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:21,605
<i>It's always a little
stressful in the beginning.</i>

701
01:19:21,638 --> 01:19:23,607
<i>It gets easier.</i>

702
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,374
<i>You can handle it, honey,
I know you can.</i>

703
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:27,377
Yeah.

704
01:19:27,411 --> 01:19:30,047
<i>Well, give us a call
on the weekend, okay?</i>

705
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,615
<i>We want to hear all about it.</i>

706
01:19:31,648 --> 01:19:34,685
- I promise I will.
- <i>Okay.</i>

707
01:19:34,718 --> 01:19:37,320
<i>Now it's getting late and
I've got to take this dog out.</i>

708
01:19:37,353 --> 01:19:39,857
- <i>But we'll be waiting for your call, okay?</i>
- Okay.

709
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,759
<i>And get
a good night's sleep, okay?</i>

710
01:19:42,726 --> 01:19:45,062
- Okay.
- <i>Good night.</i>

711
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,563
Bye. I'll talk to you later.

712
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:50,201
