2
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,749
In New York City,
there's a fine Line between Law and chaos.

3
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,615
On that Line Live Danson and Highsmith.

4
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,348
Tell me again
why I decided to get on this roof!

5
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,730
I think you can chalk that up
to bad life choices.

6
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,040
Get rid of that asshole.

7
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,083
-Uh-oh!
-I hate it when you say ""uh-oh!""

8
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,561
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

9
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,658
Come on with it, then!

10
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,070
Whoa, hey!

11
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,280
That"s trouble.

12
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,423
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

13
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,678
That"s it. I"m sick of all this running.

14
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,680
Hang on!

15
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:53,072
You have the right to remain silent!

16
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,200
But I wanna hear you scream!

17
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,783
Down on the ground!

18
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
Detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!

19
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,021
One at a time, all right?

20
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,391
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,
New York Observer Online.

21
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,436
These suspects were caught
with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

22
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,937
a misdemeanor in some states.

23
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,271
Do you think this arrest was worth
$12 million in property damages?

24
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,707
Why don"t we let New York City
answer that question?

25
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,271
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

26
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,819
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

27
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,483
Danson, are the rumors about
you and Kim Kardashian true?

28
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,151
No comment.

29
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,993
But, yes.

30
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,056
Danson and Highsmith,
free hot dogs for life!

31
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,668
No drinks. No drinks.
I can"t do it. I can"t do it.

32
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:08,470
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive,
and seX with style. They're rock stars.

33
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,573
Then you got your jokers,
your ball busters, your vets...

34
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,585
...and the other guys.

35
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,516
We know, We know. We know.

36
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,788
All right, all right, all right.
Listen up, listen up!

37
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,423
We"re having a celebration tonight at Butter.

38
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,093
Brody Jenner"s gonna be there. Bai Ling.

39
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,966
-That little short bitch from Jersey Shore.
-Yeah!

40
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,132
And most of you are on the list.

41
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,142
You"re the best.

42
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,178
Guys, l"m gonna say something right now.

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,645
It"s about a man who came from Austria
with a dream.

44
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,547
-Arnold Schwarzenegger!
-Let me finish.

45
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,017
He became a champion
and then a movie star, all right?

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,281
-Arnold Schwarzenegger!
-God damn it, let me...

47
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,289
They ruined the story.
They ruined the story.

48
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,984
Let... What... The point is,

49
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:56,153
We couldn"t do our!ob if it Weren"t
for you guys doing all the paper-work,

50
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,527
answering the phones, and all that
stupid shit that We don"t like to do.

51
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,622
All the gun fights, all the car chases,

52
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,568
all the sex we don"t wanna have With Women,
but We have to,

53
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,334
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

54
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,670
And we"d do it again and again.

55
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,040
Hey, you shut your face!

56
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,339
If we wanna hear you talk,

57
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
I will shove my arm up your ass
and Work your mouth like a puppet!

58
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,074
You hear me? You hear me?

59
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,551
-Cash bar.
-Yeah.

60
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,484
Peace out, bitches.

61
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,825
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

62
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,383
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

63
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,652
All right, right there.

64
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,698
Just back up,!just like right there.

65
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,392
All right,!just one... Just a...

66
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,230
There you go, right there. Right there.

67
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,896
This is their paperwork.
You know they"re not gonna do it.

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,203
That"s right.
This paperwork is like Bob"s Wife here.

69
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,939
It"s thick, ugly,
got Danson"s fingerprints all over it.

70
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,445
-No offense, Bob.
-That"s all right.

71
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,675
-Anyway, now who wants it?
-I do!

72
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,412
All right!
Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!

73
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,586
-Nice work. Thanks, Allen.
-Thank you, Captain.

74
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,950
""l"ll do it! I"ll do it!""

75
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,126
Stop humming that song!

76
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,961
-I can hum if I want to.
-No, I know you can.

77
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,300
I"m asking you to stop.

78
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,632
-well, if you"re asking, then l"ll stop.
-Thank you.

79
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,740
Could you not smile like that?

80
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,650
Now you"re asking me to mask my emotions
because of how it makes you feel.

81
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,551
That I will not do.

82
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,226
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

83
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,320
This isn't"t accounting or wherever the hell

84
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,764
you and your little pocket calculator
were transferred from.

85
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,803
Forensic accounting, okay.
And it"s an important part of the!ob.

86
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,965
Yeah, whatever. Stop being so overtly happy
about doing shit work, you moron.

87
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,940
Hey, guys. Reminder.

88
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,241
The police union picnic"s
coming up this weekend.

89
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,943
My wife"s making her famous
deviled eggs, again. My waistline"s furious.

90
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,417
It"s a bad time, Bob!

91
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,515
All right.

92
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,182
Going to get a slice.

93
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,633
You know what l!just did?

94
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,002
I!just walked out that door,
saw a couple detectives,

95
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,598
and I was about to start bad mouthing you
behind your back,

96
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,871
but I stopped myself,
because my pops taught me

97
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,606
that a man who talks
behind somebody"s back is a coward.

98
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,875
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

99
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,779
Good, "cause l"m gonna tell you
directly to your face.

100
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,615
-No. You don"t have to.
-No, I don"t like you.

101
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,120
I think you"re a fake cop.

102
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,955
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal?
It sounds feminine.

103
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,790
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

104
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:47,561
Even if you weren"t in my food chain,
I would go out of my way to attack you.

105
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,225
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

106
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,929
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean
and freaking eat you!

107
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,397
And then l"d bang your tuna girlfriend.

108
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,842
Okay, first off,
a lion swimming in the ocean?

109
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,106
Lions don"t like water.

110
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,244
If you"d placed it near a river or some sort
of fresh water source, that"d make sense.

111
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,883
But you find yourself in the ocean,
20-foot waves,

112
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,717
I"m assuming
it"s off the coast of South Africa,

113
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,356
coming up against a full-grown,
800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?

114
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,588
You lose that battle.

115
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,597
You lose that battle nine times out of ten.
And guess what?

116
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,965
You"'ve wandered into our school of tuna,
and we now have a taste of lion.

117
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,470
We"''ve talked to ourselves.
We"''ve communicated.

118
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,732
-Yeah?
-And said, ""You know what?

119
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,970
""Lion tastes good.
Let"s go get some more lion.""

120
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,637
We"'ve developed a system
to establish a beachhead

121
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,647
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

122
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,910
And we will corner your pride,

123
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,885
-your children, your offspring.
-How you gonna do that?

124
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,548
We will construct a series
of breathing apparatus With kelp.

125
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,115
We will be able to trap
certain amounts of oxygen.

126
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:51,663
It"s not gonna be days at a time,
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.

127
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,426
That will give us enough time
to figure out where you live,

128
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,594
go back to the sea, get more oxygen,
and then stalk you.

129
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,162
You!just lost at your own game.
You"re outgunned and outmanned.

130
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,238
Did that go
the way you thought it was gonna go?

131
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,439
Nope.

132
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,614
Two minutes before the markets open,

133
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,955
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global,
ringing the opening bell.

134
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,628
With Boardman is investment banker,
David Ershon,

135
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,154
who manages 40%%
of LendL's $70-billion equity pool.

136
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,099
How much did we lose?

137
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,467
You may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.

138
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,631
-$32.
-Million?

139
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,937
No, billion.

140
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,478
Shit!

141
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,650
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members.
I popped two of them off the draw.

142
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,513
-Bang, bang.
-Yeah.

143
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,212
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

144
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,812
Shit, I feel like l"m there now.

145
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,085
I hear a whistle. My partner"s on the roof.

146
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,490
He says, ""Let"s even the odds!""

147
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,993
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump.
I send one through his chest.

148
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,557
Game over, bitches.

149
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,332
-All right.
-Yeah.

150
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:11,936
Jimmy? Let"s talk about
how that story made you feel.

151
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,001
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

152
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,248
I know it"s very tempting.

153
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,411
You want to impress your friends.

154
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,076
But this is serious stuff
we"re dealing with, okay?

155
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,589
This is firing your weapon
in the line of duty.

156
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,749
Officer Hoitz?

157
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,724
Oh, man.

158
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,954
-Come on!
-Here we go.

159
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,428
Would you like to share?

160
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,656
No, l"d rather not.

161
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,399
Officer Hoitz, you"'ve been coming here
for six months now,

162
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,264
and you haven"t said a word.

163
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,702
This is a safe room, no!judgment here.

164
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,864
Jerkoff.

165
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,238
That"s!judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

166
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,835
I relive it every night.

167
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,112
Bronx, October.

168
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,011
Game 7 of the World Series.

169
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,347
For all the marbles. High pressure,
unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.

170
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,252
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel.
I told him to stop.

171
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,255
whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!

172
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,688
Finally pulled my gun.

173
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,056
Pulled a deadly weapon.
He started running at me.

174
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,027
Don"t make me shoot! I"ll do it!

175
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,128
Are you deaf? You hear me yell, ""Freeze""?

176
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,360
You dick! I"m Derek Jeter! You shot me!

177
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,199
-You cost me 20 grand on that game!
-Douche bag.

178
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,738
Cost the city a championship.

179
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,138
I was being groomed
for a top position in homicide.

180
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,105
Now l"m stuck with a desk!jockey partner.
Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.

181
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,872
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

182
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,243
He"s a biracial angel.

183
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,975
You should"'ve shot A-Rod.

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,955
Yo, Paper Bitch.

185
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,986
-What"s up, man?
-Hey. Hey, guys.

186
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,789
-Paper Bitch.
-Paper Bitch.

187
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,954
I don"t like that, actually.

188
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,827
I know you guys think it"s fun,
but I don"t like that name.

189
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,490
Still working on
the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?

190
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,659
-Shit.
-No, actually, actually, that"s...

191
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,134
What is this? That looks stupid.

192
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,832
Guys, it"s illegal permitting for construction.
Specifically, scaffolding.

193
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,465
Some of the guys were talking.

194
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:53,336
They were like, ""How come you"'ve never
fired your weapon in the office before?""

195
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,140
Good point.

196
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,211
I"m sorry, I don"t follow.

197
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,748
You"'ve never fired your weapon
in the office.

198
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,977
We all have, you know.
It"s called a desk pop.

199
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,748
Fellas, look, I know
you don"t respect me as a police officer.

200
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,981
-Not true.
-l"m not stupid.

201
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,524
I"m not gonna discharge my firearm
in the office.

202
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,184
Gamble, listen to me.
I"ll try to make it real clear.

203
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,424
we honor the flag, and you crap on it
when you don"t shoot your gun in the office.

204
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,590
Jimmy.
When"s the last time you had a desk pop?

205
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,327
September "08.

206
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,765
-Be a man. Do it.
-Now.

207
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,532
-Please, please, do it.
-Pop one off!

208
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,699
-There you go. Pop it off!
-Don"t think,!just go!

209
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,333
-Here we go.
-Do it, yes.

210
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,003
He did it!

211
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,944
Hey! Shots fired!

212
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,176
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!

213
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,243
It"s a real thing, right?

214
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,843
-A desk pop?
-Yeah.

215
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,047
No, that"s not real!

216
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:41,082
They were so convincing in their argument,
they swung me.

217
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,927
All right, Allen,
you"re gonna have to hand over your gun.

218
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,123
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,226
Captain, you really wanna disarm this guy,
take out the batteries in the calculator.

220
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,704
All right, l"m gonna give you this.
This is a dummy gun. I use it for ceremony.

221
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,934
There.

222
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,871
You get this back
When I feel you know how to handle it.

223
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,143
Listen, guys.
I"m Working two!obs. I"m Working here.

224
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,414
And I got another!ob
at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?

225
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,115
I"m doing that!just to put a kid through NYU

226
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,956
so he can explore his bisexuality
and become a dee!ay.

227
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,485
NoW the last thing I need
is a ballistics report in the unit.

228
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,963
I"m!just gonna ask you guys,
please, come on, really.

229
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,796
Just think about... Just be smart.

230
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,798
211 in progress.

231
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,960
They're using a wrecking ball
to clean out Castien Jewelry.

232
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,469
All right, We got it.

233
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,869
-Good luck, guys. Have a good one.
-Allen, let"s go.

234
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,840
-No, I got Work to do.
-What? This is Work!

235
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,504
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith.
We roll in heavy.

236
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,911
You cream puffs, sit tight.

237
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,345
You gotta be shitting me!

238
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,512
You can"t keep me cooped up in here, okay?

239
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,680
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!

240
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,057
Did he!just...
Did he!just call himself a peacock?

241
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,829
Let"s go! Let"s go!

242
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,930
Come on, fellas!

243
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,573
Wednesday night is taco night
at Rikers lsland!

244
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,049
That"s the second one this Week!

245
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,417
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

246
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,221
Let"s go!

247
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,121
Yeah!

248
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,892
Heads up!

249
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,359
Shit.

250
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,540
Special Forces zipline.

251
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,913
Cut that line! Cut it! Let"s go!

252
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,417
-These guys are pros.
-Let"s go!

253
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,888
You thinking What l"m thinking, partner?

254
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,583
Aim for the bushes.

255
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,849
Cops still argue to this day
why Danson and Highsmith jumped.

256
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,916
Maybe it was just pride, having survived
so many brushes with death.

257
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,155
Maybe their egos pushed them off.

258
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,959
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.

259
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:11,765
Either way, there was a hole
in New York City, and it needed to be filled.

260
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,135
Two days ago, this city wept.

261
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,165
We Lost two heroes
who gave everything for us,

262
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:23,180
who paid that ultimate sacrifice
so that we may walk these streets safely.

263
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,674
There Wasn'"t even an awning
in their direction.

264
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,945
-No, I know.
-They!just!umped 20 stories.

265
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,351
Doesn'"t make sense, does it?

266
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,323
I only hope God Lets them take their.357s
with them to heaven.

267
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,725
It"s our moment, Allen.
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

268
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,891
-We"re at a funeral. Show some respect.
-What?

269
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,225
You don"t think every other detective here
isn'"t thinking the same thing?

270
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,131
Allen, listen to me.
Danson and Highsmith are gone.

271
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,199
Their desks are empty.
Someone has to fill those seats.

272
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,837
That someone is us, okay?
The city"s dying for a hero.

273
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,670
-ls it?
-Yeah.

274
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,378
What about nine million
socially-conscious and unified citizens,

275
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,215
all!just stepping up and doing their part?

276
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,551
As a little kid, didn'"t you dress up
and play cops and robbers?

277
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,817
I"ll tell you What I did as a little kid.

278
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,224
I Went to school and made my bed.

279
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,922
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

280
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,330
And believe me, there Were some
discrepancies, and I Was grounded.

281
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,266
What the hell are you?

282
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,338
Well, Well, Well. What do We got here?

283
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:24,502
Look at these two!amokes, Would you?
One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

284
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,510
Have some decorum. We"re at a funeral.

285
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,777
You Wanna dance, brolio?

286
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:37,117
I Will rock your body With big, nasty hooks.
You"ll be pissing blood out of your ass.

287
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,280
That"s horrible.

288
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,550
Why don"t you step back, man?

289
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,092
You touch him, I swear to God

290
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,024
I"m gonna beat the shit out of you
With Allen"s head.

291
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,620
He"s not gonna do that. That"s hyperbole.
But that"s a Weird example.

292
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,528
-You Wanna go?
-I Wanna go!

293
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,299
-Get him off.
-Kick his ass, Martin.

294
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,130
Yeah. How do you like that?

295
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,063
-Pull his hair!
-I love it.

296
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,935
This hurts so good.

297
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,037
-Very sorry for your loss, ma"am.
-What a lovely hat.

298
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,670
I love your shoes.

299
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,771
-lt"s fine, it"s fine.
-Go, go.

300
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,542
Punish him!

301
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,642
Oh, man.

302
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
Do it. That"s how We do it in the hood.

303
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,583
-Punish him.
-That"s not even a move.

304
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,123
I"m the Winner.
I"m the Winner, everybody saw it.

305
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,195
What the hell is going on here?

306
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,321
Two good men are dead,

307

Big metal butterflies fluttering around
in your stomach?

370

That"s a lot of cocaine.

389
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,779
Did you yell ""America""
When you hit the accelerator?

390
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,653
Nope. No. No.

391
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,691
I"'ve never actually put my foot
all the Way down

392
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,692
to the ground With the accelerator like that.

393
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,164
It got me slightly aroused.

394
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,297
Here We go.

403
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,356
We"'ve had our fun, huh?

404
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,399

407
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,905
""At the crime scene, LOL.""

408
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,702
-Good tweet, good tweet.
-Yeah, thanks.

409
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,842
America has always been defined
by its excess.

410
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,516
The Grand Canyon,

and a Subaru station wagon.

414
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,261
And it's because of this excess
that I have flourished.

415
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,958
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.

416
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,764
Live for excess. It's the American way.

417
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,607

You don"t think l"m a real cop, do you?

439
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,670
No, I don"t. I"'ve said that
directly to your face numerous times.

440
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,867
I Was really honest about that.

441
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,467

444
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,920
NoW, according to Ask Jeeves, this perp

Why do you even care?

The Way you fart.
Even your farts, they"re not manly.

460
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,458
You"re being ridiculous.

461
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,127
They sound like a baby blowing out
the candles on a birthday cake.

462
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,533
-What?
-Like a little...

463
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,469
-You know What bugs me about you?
-What?

464
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:42,904
I"m pretty sure you"'ve never voted.

465
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:46,307
No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880.
Play of the Week.

466
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,743
You"re like a child in a leather!jacket.
That"s What you"re like.

467
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,905
Get out of the Way, man!

468
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,881
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

469
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,248
Yeah, Well, it"s Sir David Ershon,
but I don"t bother With the...

470
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,585
Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen,
if you don"t mind. Thank you.

471
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,922
-Excuse me, but you"re under arrest, okay?
-What?

472
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,930
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do or say can be used...

473
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,125
-What"s the next part?
-As a floatation device.

474
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,724
As a floatation device.

475
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,329
You know What? That"s very funny.
I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.

476
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,236
-Really?
-Are you guys for real?

477
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,400
Am I being punk"d?

478
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,840
Detective Allen Gamble.

479
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,846
We are in a cocaine-covered car,
and We are bringing in a perp.

480
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,746
-One David Ershon.

481
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,842
-Thank you. 175 pounds.
-Shut up, man, shut up!

482
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,852
Martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B
talking to Shepard Smith right noW.

483
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,790
We arrest this!jerkoff
for a scaffolding permit?

484
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,089
Wait, Wait, Wait,
What am I being arrested for?

485
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,027
For scaffolding permit violation...

486
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,939
-I got my insurance card. Somewhere.
-Easy, mate.

487
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,374
-What the hell? You ran right into us!
-Stand over there.

488
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,002
Wood?

489
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,672
What the...

490
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,543
-Couldn"t see the car. It"s big enough, mate.
-What?

491
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,276
Do not let these men take me.

492
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,144
Hi.

493
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,778
Why"s she looking at you like that?

494
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,346
That"s my car!

495
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,189
Hey, hey, hey!
We didn'"t exchange insurance information!

496
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,120
Hey! Excuse me!

497
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,398
Why did they take our shoes?

498
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,901
-What the hell!just happened?
-Where"s my iPhone?

499
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,198
I think We"'ve Walked 30 blocks, man.

500
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:27,335
I don"t get Why We can"t!just call the office
and have a squad car come pick us up.

501
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,903
No. They took our shoes,
our guns, and our car.

502
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,642
There"s no Way that"s going out on the radio.

503
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,145
Look, if We"re gonna do this together,
there"s some issues We need to settle, okay?

504
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,815
I mean, you said I had a Weak chin.
You said the Way I pee is feminine.

505
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,084
How do you think that makes me feel?

506
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:45,254
I mean, that list you have,
you put a lot of thought in. It"s Weird.

507
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,593
I hear you.

508
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:52,432
Let"s clean the slate right noW. Fresh start.

509
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
All right. Fresh start.

510
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,436
Maybe We should call ourselves
the Febreze Brothers,

511
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,103
"cause it"s feeling so fresh right noW.

512
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,740
Right?

513
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,917
Let"s do another fresh start, "cause
l!just Wanted to punch you in the face.

514
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,781
Fine, fresh start.

515
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,686
It"s the last one.

516
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,691
I have to be able to express myself
and say things, you know.

517
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,393
-Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up!
-Listen up!

518
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,399
Got a high profile kidnapping.

519
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,933
David Ershon, Wealthy banker,
multinational team.

520
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,062
Maybe a sleeper cell, but it"s too early to tell.

521
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,576
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes?
"Cause your feet are black.

522
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,635
Who cares? It"s not important, okay?

523
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,271
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

524
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,878
-Bye, guys.
-Bye-bye.

525
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,044
Come on.

526
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,650
Guys, this is Don Beaman,
the attorney for Mr. Ershon.

527
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,884
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

528
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,893
-Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch!
-Hey, hey, hey!

529
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,724
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!

530
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,764
-That"s the guy Who took our guns, Captain.
-And my shoes!

531
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,892
Wait a minute, Wait a minute. Did you
identify yourselves as police officers?

532
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,060
What is this?

533
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,468
-Allen, tell me. Did you?
-No, We did not.

534
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,565
Sorry, gentlemen.
We thought you Were abducting Mr. Ershon.

535
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,270
It"s only protocol.

536
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:11,108
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this
scaffolding situation. The case is closed.

537
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,673
I"'ve taken care of all necessary paper-work.

538
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,878
And you fellas, at this point,
should!just be glad that

539
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,479
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges
for excessive use of force.

540
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,024
-Thank you, Captain.
-You bet.

541
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,151
Australian?

542
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,661
Special Forces, right?

543
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,554
Best Watch your step, Detective.

544
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,361
There are three things I love in this World.

545
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,526
Kylie Minogue,

546
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,902
small dimples!just above
a Woman"s buttocks...

547
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,372
Beautiful features.

548
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,205
...and the fear in a man"s eye
Who knows l"m about to hurt him.

549
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,839
Hey! Shake your dicks.
This pissing contest is over.

550
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,247
Come on, man.

551
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,914
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

552
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:56,589
And they returned your Weapons.
Here you go, Terry.

553
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,892
Allen, someone Was nice enough
to put linseed oil on it,

554
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,832
some kind of stain on that,
dark Walnut or something.

555
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,496
You might Wanna think about
dropping them a thank you note.

556
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,697
Okay.

557
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,898
You"re mad at us, huh, Gene?

558
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,704
First off, don"t call me Gene.
I"m your captain.

559
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,371
Guys, do you remember
the ""Be Smart"" speech?

560
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,572
-Sure.
-All right.

561
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,275
Well, What did you do?
What"d you do about it?

562
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,182
The opposite.
We Were not smart, Captain Gene.

563
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,221
It"s!just ""Captain.""

564
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,349
Just ""Captain."" lt"s not ""Captain Gene.""
I don"t have a kiddie show.

565
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,052
That sounds creepy, ""Captain Gene.""

566
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,521
Police mistakenly arrest
investment banker, David Ershon.

567
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,533
Was he the victim of financial profiling?

568
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:41,300
Financial profiling? That"s crazy.
He broke the law and We arrested him.

569
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,467
That Wasn't"t a security team. He said,
""Don"t let these people take me.""

570
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,977
I mean, When you hear hooves,
you think horses, not zebras.

571
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,077
What about donkeys or deer?

572
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,117
They have hooves.
What about bovine creatures?

573
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,246
Were you!just thinking to yourself,
""Fresh start""?

574
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,291
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I could see it.

575
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,450
Listen, Why don"t We!just
go over to my place?

576
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,891
We"ll talk the case down.

577
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,987
We can have a little dinner.
You can meet Sheila.

578
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,793
Two cops talking down a case
While eating food, all right?

579
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,060
-lt"s not dinner.
-Fine.

580
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,931
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

581
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,403
in case my Wife acts like a World-class bitch.

582
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:19,671
She"s a big old broad,
and she likes to Wield it.

583
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:25,681
Okay, so I put together a little bio,
complete With pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

584
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,184
I used Adobe Premiere.
I like to do a little Weekend editing.

585
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,848
I recently!just cut three minutes
out of Goodfellas.

586
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,188
David Ershon is currently
the CEO of Ershon Consortium.

587
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,352
Who"s that talking?

588
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,987
It"s the FrontLine Narration App.
It"s only 99 cents.

589
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:44,091
Ershon Consortium, current financial
investments exceed $70 billion.

590
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,194
His Largest clients include
Schering-PLough and LendL Global.

591
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:50,001
Lendl Global has those TV ads
Where I can"t figure out What they do.

592
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,168
Yeah, oil, media, health care,
you"'ve probably heard their!jingle.

593
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,213
LendL Global, we're in everything

594
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,147
David Ershon is often found
in the company of Judge Scalia...

595
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,549
-Yeah.
-...and the Lead singer of Maroon 5.

596
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,484
I mean, this guy could be
connected to drug cartels,

597
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,387
black market organ sales,
human trafficking, all of it.

598
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,118
How do you get that
from anything l!just said?

599
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,989
Hey, guys! Soup"s on.

600
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,460

601
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,656

602
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,324

607
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,874
And you come in here,
dressed like a hobo, it"s distracting.

608
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,918
I know you"re Working. I"m so sorry.

609
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,010
-Come on, seriously.
-Come on, What?

610
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,316
Who is that?

611
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,414
That"s the old...
That"s the old ball and chain.

612
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,318
Get over here.

613
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,022
-Not... Not right noW.
-Okay.

614
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,088
Look, they"re not all first-round picks, okay?

615
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,898
Come on, are you gonna tell me Who that is?

616
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,260
-Are you really Allen"s Wife?
-I know.

617
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:57,830
People are shocked
because he"s Episcopalian and l"m Catholic,

618
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,942
but somehow it Works.

619
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,238
-Are you gonna change?
-I already did.

620
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,575
It"s no big deal. You look really, really nice.

621
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:09,744
Terry, you don"t have to be polite, okay?
She looks kind of shitty.

622
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,185
Don"t speak to her like that, Allen.

623
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:15,521
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App,
you"d probably get a D-.

624
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,891
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

625
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,420
You know he"s designed three of his own?
One of them... Can I tell him?

626
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,966
One of them,
you can take a picture of anybody"s face,

627
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,866
and it"ll tell you
What the back of his head looks like.

628
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,436
-Faceback.
-Faceback.

629
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,564
Got some horrible reviews
coming out of the gate.

630
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,102
-lt"s gonna hit.
-lt"s gonna catch.

631
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,235
Why are you With Allen?

632
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,214
I mean, that"s not What I meant.
I meant, how did you guys meet?

633
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,750
It"s a really typical
""how We met"" story, Terry.

634
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,513
You"re gonna be bored by it.

635
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:46,580
I Was a dancer for the Knicks While
finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

636
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,921
Allen came into the ER
With poison ivy on his rectum.

637
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,085
Yes.

638
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,822
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

639
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,463
We immediately spent the next three days
at the La Quinta lnn,

640
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,534
-and, to be honest, We didn'"t speak.
-Three days

641
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,165
of not communicating once verbally.

642
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,533
We had actually, Without knowing it,

643
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,877
developed a language of eye flutters
and non-verbal gestures.

644
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,777
You know, Terry,
it Was!just this primal connection.

645
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:19,212
After those three days of non-verbal
communication and a Whole lot of loving,

646
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,756
I had to go to a specialist
to get my hips realigned.

647
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,790
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

648
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,093
-When they have hip dysplasia.
-Very painful.

649
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,463
It"s funny, it"s like a scene from that
one movie, always forget the name of it.

650
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,733
-With Meg Ryan.
-Yes.

651
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,777
I don"t remember a movie Where Meg Ryan
meets a guy With poison ivy up his ass.

652
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,277
-l"ll think of it. I"ll think of it.
-Okay.

653
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,075
So, What about you, Terry?
Do you have a girl?

654
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,139
I did, yeah.

655
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,718
We Were supposed to get married,
but she backed out. It"s complicated.

656
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,254
-Terry shot Derek Jeter.
-Shut up, Allen. This Was before.

657
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,584
That"s okay.

658
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,625
She's Got Mail.
That"s the name of the movie.

659
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,659
That"s it! Honey!

660
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,819
-With Tom Hanks?
-Right.

661
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,987
-And Meg Ryan.
-Meg Ryan.

662
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,155
He didn'"t have poison ivy up his ass.

663
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,561
-Yes, he did.
-Yes, he did. Yeah.

664
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,894
Way up there.

665
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,995
Well, Terry, can"t thank you enough
for coming by. What a...

666
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,731
What a Wonderful, lovely evening.
Thank you.

667
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:11,434
-lt Was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.
-lt Was my pleasure. Thank you.

668
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:16,003
And remember, all I ask of you is,
you don"t let him get hurt, Terry.

669
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,480
-She tells me that every day before I leave.
-Yep, I do.

670
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,649
I come downstairs and I make him
his fresh-cut strawberries,

671
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,516
and I say, ""Listen, my little sugar balls,
Whatever you do today,

672
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,919
""you!just don"t get hurt.""

673
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,321
Yeah. Every morning.

674
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,250
And then I show him my breasts,
and I say, ""These are Waiting for you

675
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,455
-""When you get back home.""
-Right.

676
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,431
You know, Terry, they"re not
the biggest breasts he"s ever seen,

677
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,934
-but, man, are they perky.
-Not by a long shot.

678
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,664
-And they are firm, and they are yours.
-You"re a nice lady.

679
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,667
Thank you for coming.

680
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,000
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble?
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.

681
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,170
Go for Hoitz.

682
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,804
-We found your red Prius.
-Great.

683
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,975
It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

684
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
-Come on.
-Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

685
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,650
There"s gonna be fingerprints on that car.

686
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,053
Tomorrow, We"re gonna run those
fingerprints through the system.

687
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,820
And if We get a hit, this case is gonna
heat up faster than a!junkie"s spoon.

688
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,226
You do one thing
When you Wake up tomorrow, bring it.

689
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,387
-Okay.
-Thank you, Sheila.

690
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,555
He"ll bring it.

691
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,292
-Good night!
-Good night.

692
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,698
Thank you, Sheila.

693
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,061
-Bye, Terry!
-Bye, Sheila! I"ll never forget tonight.

694
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,969
-Bye, Terry!
-All right, Allen, Whatever. Go inside.

695
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,132
Bye, Sheila!

696
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,698
-Night!
-See you... See you, Terry!

697
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,667
Bye, Sheila.

698
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,243
I don"t know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!

699
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,909
Bye, Sheila!

700
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,759
Well, here she is. They left her
under an overpass for the night.

701
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,522
You find anything?

702
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,360
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

703
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,400
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

704
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:46,527
We determined that a bunch of old,
homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.

705
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,868
-Oh, God.
-Yeah.

706
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,771
You know What that"s called
When they do that in there?

707
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,342
That"s called a soup kitchen.

708
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,002
It"s pretty rough stuff.

709
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,570
Not long after that,
a mama raccoon came along

710
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,081
and gave birth on the floor.

711
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,509
Placenta blew out
all over the back window there.

712
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,281
Yeah, and then to top it all off,
some!joker comes along

713
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,650
takes himself a nifty little dump
in the driver"s seat.

714
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,722
I think he knew you guys Were cops,

715
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,596
because this is What I Would call
a spite shit.

716
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,498
You Were able to determine all of that

717
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,397
-from the hair and fluid samples?
-Oh, yeah.

718
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,667
What about fingerprints?
You find any fingerprints?

719
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,762
-Nope, couldn"t get a one.
-Found a cell phone.

720
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,434
Yeah, that"s mine.

721
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,007
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

722
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,808
No. Believe me, everybody that Was
in on this orgy Was more than Willing.

723
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,973
In fact, they even left you a note here.

724
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,746
""Thanks for the F-shack.
Love, Dirty Mike and the boys.""

725
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:36,910
Here"s something We found.

726
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,582
We found about a dozen
unscratched lottery tickets.

727
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,817
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

728
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,327
Yeah, it"s a real shame, you know.
I got myself a Prius. It"s a hell of a machine.

729
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,133
It"s my first brand-new car.
I"'ve never owned a new car.

730
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,964
Found a deer vagina.

731
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,032
-What?
-Thought it Was human lips at first.

732
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,607
Then We took a closer look.
It Was definitely a deer vagina.

733
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:00,808
Not even a free ticket.

734
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,274
What are We gonna do?

735
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,441
We got no fingerprints,
a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

736
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,152
Look at this, there"s a two-minute phone call
made after We Were!umped.

737
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,688
-They used your phone?
-They ghost dialed.

738
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,916
Someone probably sat on it.

739
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,754
It could have recorded some of their
conversation When Ershon got grabbed.

740
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,191
We gotta hear the other side of that call.

741
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,727
Nope, no, it"s nothing.

742
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,061
-Nothing? It"s the only lead We have.
-lt"s nothing. It"s nothing.

743
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,532
Why did you!just get super!jumpy?

744
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,727
What?

745
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,771
It"s an ex-girlfriend, okay?

746
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,601
What"s the matter?
What happened With you guys?

747
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,538
She Was!just a bit of a handful, that"s it.

748
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,481
Allen, it"s the only lead We have.

749
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,914
We either go With this
or We Walk away from this case right noW.

750
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,385
Fine. Let"s go see her.

751
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,562
Hello, Christinith.

752
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,227
Hello, Allen.

753
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,403
-That"s my partner, Terry.
-Hi, Telly.

754
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:08,005
-Holy shit. Dude.
-Just relax, relax.

755
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:13,182
I Waited for you in Tower Records
for four hours.

756
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,086
That Was 13 years ago.

757
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:24,093
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.
Who Wants some Arnie Palmies?

758
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,021
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

759
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,294
-Hal,!just place it down, please.
-All righty.

760
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,363
Okay.

761
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,638
I did things in bed With you
that I haven"t done With anyone since.

762
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,009
No.

763
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,878
-Christinith, your husband, it"s awkward.
-Oh, no, he knows all of this.

764
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,474
-You"re a lucky dog.
-lt"s true.

765
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,387
Christine, this is a lovely house.

766
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,517
It"s Christinith.
Are you stupid, or are you deaf?

767
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,321
Christinith, you idiot!

768
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:04,032
You come to our house,
you get my Wife"s name right!

769
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,833
-What?
-Christinith!

770
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,667
Look, We really appreciate the hospitality.

771
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,167
We"d!just love to get the message off
your cell phone.

772
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,201
We believe it might give us information
regarding a kidnapping.

773
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:21,786
Okay. Why don"t you come to the kitchen,
and I Will let you listen to it

774
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,311
and everyone else stay here.

775
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,350
-Okay, sweetie.
-Come on.

776
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,594
-There"s my phone.
-Great, thank you for...

777
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,437
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

778
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,905
-You"re so strong.
-l"m stronger than you Will ever know!

779
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,000
I hate you! I hate you!

780
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,603
You"re so adorable.
Look at your face. Look at your face.

781
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,617
You go, ""l Wuv you.""
Say it. ""l Wuv you, Cwistinith.""

782
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,861
You probably think because of the beard
that l"m really hairy.

783
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,930
But l"m not.

784
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,799
Shaved.

785
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,030
-Allen!
-He"s fine.

786
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,197
Question.

787
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,399
What Would you rather be,

788
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,243
a bear or a dog?

789
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,346
-I don"t care.
-I Wanna be

790
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,275
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

791
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,318
"Cause that Way, I could live in the house

792
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,557
but I still get to make a doodie
out in the Woods.

793
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,586
Allen!

794
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,354
Allen! Allen!

795
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,663
-This is police evidence. Terry! Let"s go!
-Hey!

796
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,260
You get back here
and you make love to my Wife!

797
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,895
Allen! Allen!

798
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,267
I don"t get it, man. I!just do not get it.

799
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,607
I mean,
that girl Christinith Was seriously hot.

800
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,340
Your Wife is crazy hot.

801
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,110
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick,
she threw you a ""Do me"" vibe.

802
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
What is it With you and hot ladies?

803
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,586
First off, my Wife is cute, but she"s not hot.

804
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,750
Dude, you"re insane.
Your Wife is scalding hot.

805
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,226
-You Wanna listen to this message or not?
-Yeah, Whatever.

806
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,296
You have one job, mate.

807
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,989
Find a sucker to invest with you

808
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,034
so you can pay my boss back
the money you Lost.

809
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,330
And I don't care who.

810
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,735
Right. I actually think I found a sucker...

811
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,273
-He"s talking to Ershon.
-...to invest $32 billion.

812
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,933
Who"s got $32 billion to rob?

813
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,273
Once I get the money, I'LL falsify the records

814
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,176
to show their massive Losses
and then repay your employer.

815
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,911
Now, since you're following me,
I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,

816
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,577
and after that...

817
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,450
I told you it wasn't"t a security team.

818
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,919
-He Was being abducted.
-Obviously, but What kind... Holy...

819
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,550
Nobody leaves our house
Without making love to my Wife!

820
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,787
-ls that him?
-Yeah!

821
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,692
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

822
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,595
-Holy shit!
-They chased us 20 miles.

823
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,894
-You come back here! You get back here!
-Allen!

824
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,237
2300 Park Avenue.
It"s the offices of the lottery.

825
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,075
Holy shit, the lottery tickets We found.

826
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,883
Ershon is using the lottery money
to cover his losses.

827
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:10,785
$32 billion. That"s the state"s money.

828
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,083
Well, What do We tell Mauch?
A guy lost some money.

829
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,649
We have a scratchy cell phone message
and an address. It"s still half a case.

830
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,719
There"s gotta be some sort of paper trail.
If We can find that, if We can track it,

831
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:21,992
then We can go to Mauch.

832
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,759
So, I did some more research
on Ershon"s accounting firm,

833
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,566
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

834
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,802
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

835
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,938
Hold on, l"m up.

836
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,306
I gave my Love to Erin

837
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,947
She promised to be true

838
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:48,481
I went to war to come back

839
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,528
And find five British soldiers

840
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,827
Had their way with her

841
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,369
It was consensual

842
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,163
Done?

843
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,207
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm
in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

844
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,369
has only one client, David Ershon.

845
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,004
Pretty rinky-dink operation
for a guy like that.

846
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,811
Looks like We"re going to Jersey
to visit an accounting firm.

847
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,648
That"s a shitty day.

848
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,949
And all their fathers were hanged

849
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,484
And the children all got pink eye

850
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:34,402
While their Harry Potter books were burned

851
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,478
Do you have fun singing those songs?
They"re really depressing.

852
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,980
I do. They"re full of rich history.

853
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,174
Damn it, l"m late.
I Was supposed to go meet my lady.

854
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,652
I thought you said you guys split up.

855
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,246
Let"s!just keep our thing about Work, okay?

856
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,915
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

857
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,016
Hey, get off me, man.

858
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,342
What the hell are you doing?

859
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,009
I"m dancing, Terry.
What the hell are you doing here?

860
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,246
I love you, Francine.

861
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:26,584
If you Were With me, you wouldn't"t be here
in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!

862
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,718
This is a ballet studio, Terry.
Okay? These poles are horizontal.

863
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,854
He loves you very much, Francine.

864
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,399
-Who is this guy?
-What are you doing here, Allen?

865
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,094
It"s the code. I"m your partner.

866
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,362
I"m here to support a friend
and a Work colleague.

867
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,928
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

868
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,907
Who"s this, your new boyfriend?
Great. You got a new boyfriend.

869
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:49,412
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

870
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,277
I know that this is a big surprise,

871
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,214
but there are other things in the World
besides being a cop. Okay?

872
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,752
NoW, if you Will excuse me, l"m gonna dance.

873
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,618
What, you don"t think I can do this shit?

874
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,335
That Was surprisingly good, Terry.

875
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,338
-I love you, Francine.
-You don"t know What love is.

876
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,379
He loves you very much, Francine!

877
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,380
I heard it When he said it. Thank you.

878
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,677
You know What you"re doing to me?
You"re killing me inside.

879
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,877
And don"t eyeball me, man!

880
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,954
You"re running around
With this crack-dealing drug addict?

881
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,113
Terry!

882
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,884
He does not approve of your behavior!

883
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,959
Can you please go?

884
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,324
And you, too,
creepy guy standing in the door?

885
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,660
Let"s go, Allen.

886
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,694
I think We all experienced
our own ballet today.

887
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,834
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

888
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,864
You"re kind of making things Worse.

889
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,317
-You okay?
-Yeah, l"m fine.

890
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,246
Hey, I didn'"t know you could dance.

891
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,660
We used to do those dance moves
to make fun of guys When We Were kids,

892
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,092
show them how queer they Were, okay?

893
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,023
-You learned to dance like that sarcastically?
-Yeah, I guess.

894
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,661
Stay out of my personal life, okay?
The kid flies private.

895
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,900
Stay focused on the case, man.
I"ll see you in Jersey tomorrow.

896
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,899
All right, Terry.

897
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,038
Hey, that Was liberating for me.
I don"t know how it felt for you.

898
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,936
Here, check this out.
Article from six months ago.

899
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,597
Talking about how the lottery is looking

900
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,108
to invest their $30-billion fund
more aggressively.

901
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:01,937
So he"s dealing drugs?

902
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,112
No, it"s not drugs. This isn't"t Miami Vice.

903
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,050
Look, l"m sorry. I!just...

904
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:16,454
I am in a bit of a state today.
Sheila and I got into it last night.

905
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,359
What happened?

906
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,062
She Was interested in taking this class
at The Learning Annex, right?

907
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,634
Called ""The Art of Oral Sex""?

908
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,599
You know, We!just don"t have it
in the budget right noW.

909
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,174
It"s always about her.

910
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,543
Yeah, that"s... That"s messed up.

911
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,439
Hey, I got you a gift.

912
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,047
I!just saw something, and I thought of you,
and so, I don"t Want it to be Weird.

913
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,244
I!just Wanted to be nice.

914
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,683
Of course it"s Weird.

915
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,585
It"s a grown man
giving another man a present.

916
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,589
There you go. Open it up.

917
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,093
It"s okay, you"re Welcome.

918
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,597
I like to do things like that.

919
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:56,790
Take a look What it says.

920
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,110
You know,
because We"re both in law enforcement.

921
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,769
We both like Women.

922
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,872
But I got a Weird sense of humor.
I"m a sick puppy.

923
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,377
I can"t look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

924
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,749
Me, too.

925
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,320
Real nice. You know, it"s all class.

926
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,961
-Okay.
-Don"t do that shit any more.

927
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,429
Yeah, believe me, I Won"t.

928
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,364
Do you understand
What"s so funny about it, though?

929
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,531
"Cause it"s the FBl, right?
It has the same logo, the same shield.

930
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,439
And at first glance, you"re like,
it"s!just a mug that says ""FBl.""

931
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,674
But then at second glance,
you"re like, ""Female Body lnspector""?

932
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,909
Get out of town. This is outrageous...

933
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,279
Shut up!

934
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,027
I"m gonna climb over
that anger Wall of yours

935
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,192
one of these days,

936
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,428
and it"s gonna be glorious.

937
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:12,635
Shouldn't"t We tell Mauch that
We"re going to check this place out?

938
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,011
For What? We"re!just going to check it out.

939
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,876
I know, but it"s procedure.

940
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,074
Terry answers to no one.

941
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,911
I do What I do.

942
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,421
What accounting firm is closed at 1 1:00 a.m.
on a Tuesday?

943
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,751
This is a shithole.

944
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,489
I love bombs.

945
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,762
I can"t hear! I can"t hear!

946
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,228
There"s blood blisters on my hands!

947
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,397
Oh, my God!

948
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,771
How do they Walk away in movies
Without flinching

949
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,571
When it explodes behind them?

950
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,909
There"s no Way! I call bullshit on that!

951
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,581
When they flew the Millennium Falcon
outside of the Death Star,

952
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,644
and it Was followed by the explosion,
that Was bullshit!

953
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:02,020
Don"t you dare badmouth Star Wars!
That Was all accurate!

954
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,093
I need an MRl.

955
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,461
I need an MRl! I"'ve got soft tissue damage.

956
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:10,957
There"s no Way
I don"t have soft tissue damage.

957
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,126
Please stop.

958
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,931
I!just Wanna go somewhere
and breastfeed right noW!

959
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:22,477
Fire Department said it Was a gas leak,
but no Way. That Was timed.

960
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,343
They didn'"t Wanna kill us,
but they Wanted to scare us.

961
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,939
Yeah, Well, they succeeded, okay?

962
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,645
I"m tired of this. All right?

963
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,279
I"m tired of explosions
and people pointing guns at me.

964
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
I Wanna go back to my desk.

965
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,050
Guess What? Life gets loud sometimes
and messes With your ears.

966
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,629
You can"t escape it by hiding
at your desk for your Whole life.

967
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,461
You know What? Yes, you can.
I"'ve done it for years, okay?

968
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,468
There"s no explosions at my desk.

969
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:51,473
There"s no explosions at my home
With my plain Wife, in my plain house.

970
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,539
What are you afraid of, man?

971
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,174
I"m your partner. You can tell me.
What the hell are you hiding from?

972
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,284
I Was a sophomore in college.

973
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,750
The university I Went to
decided they needed to raise tuition.

974
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:16,730
A classmate of mine, Brenda, in an effort
to raise money and stay in school,

975
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,768
came up With a nifty plan

976
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,303
Where she thought she"d date guys
and charge them money.

977
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,063
I go on dates all the time,

978
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,267
With a Whole bunch of,
you know, boys and stuff.

979
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,708
And I kind of need somebody to help me out,
like, you know, my partner in crime.

980
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,543
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

981
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,207
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that"s What I Was thinking.

982
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,808
-Provide transportation services.
-Yeah, yeah.

983
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,046
-lt"s gonna be a good time.
-Thanks so much for asking me.

984
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,589
She said she needed my help to make sure
that the dates went okay

985
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,115
and that the guys paid her.
She said she"d give me a percentage.

986
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,492
-Oh, my God. You Were a pimp.
-What? God, no.

987
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,656
No, I Was!just trying to help a friend.

988
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,326
We started making a Lot of money.

989
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,237
And wouldn’t you know it,
some of Brenda's girl friends

990
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,002
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

991
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,771
Pretty soon, there were about 14 Ladies
that I was protecting

992
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,472
while they gave me money.

993
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,104
That's called a stable of whores.

994
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,953
We decided I shouldn't"t use my real name.
So We came up With the name ""Gator.""

995
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,655
I"m telling you, you Were a pimp.

996
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,350
No! Are you even listening to the story?

997
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,254
Anyway, one day,
I Wake up and I look in the mirror,

998
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,594
and I don"t like What I see.

999
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,360
I mean, I had gotten out of control,
and I didn't even realize it.

1000
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,503
You can"t have a conscience
in the pimp game.

1001
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,003
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1002
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,304
Candy and Jolene, said,
""We gotta take you in,""

1003
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,676
and they dropped me off
at the emergency room.

1004
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,681
That"s Where I met Sheila. I Was a mess.

1005
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:44,982
I made a promise to myself and to her
that I Would never get out of control again.

1006
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,187
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1007
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,191
I became an accountant
for the police department.

1008
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,523
The most stable!ob I could think of.

1009
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,531
An accountant for law and order.

1010
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,897
I!just don"t Wanna ever feel out of control
like that ever again.

1011
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,703
Don"t Worry. I got your back.

1012
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,210
NoW I say We go get in Ershon"s grill
and see if he cracks.

1013
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:13,078
-l"m tired of all this tippy-toeing around.
-Okay.

1014
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,146
You can either walk the plank
or take your panties off.

1015
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,846
The choice is yours.

1016
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,187
-I want to take my panties off.
-You've made a wise choice, you have.

1017
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:27,060
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble and the officer
Who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1018
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,859
Gentlemen, please.

1019
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,231
-Remember us, hotshot?
-Of course I do. Please, sit.

1020
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,996
There she blows.

1021
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,671
Two of those Russian Waters, please.
No lime Wedges,!just cucumber.

1022
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,871
Guess Where We!just came from?
An explosion at your accounting office.

1023
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,443
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1024
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:49,450
Gas leak? The only gas leak is the one
coming out of your mouth right noW.

1025
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:54,580
I!just thank God
no one Was hurt or in!injured in a bad Way.

1026
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,387
I absolutely abhor death.

1027
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,085
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber.
The!jig is up, okay?

1028
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,062
We know that wasn't"t your security team
that grabbed you.

1029
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,465
And We know you"re targeting a big fish
to cover losses.

1030
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,900
You talk or I beat you
so it don"t show no bruises.

1031
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:11,035
God, this Water is good.
Terry, have you tried the Water?

1032
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,597
Shut up, Allen.

1033
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:15,974
I assure you,
I have no idea What you"re talking about.

1034
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,981
I understand there Was a bit of a mix-up
With the Whole scaffolding business.

1035
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:25,487
The cucumber accents the Water
in such a Way that...

1036
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:31,389
Perhaps by Way of apology,
I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1037
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,625
for the Knicks game,
With access to the Ambassador Club.

1038
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:43,132
Come on, Knicks! Come on!
I got Knicks" fever and it"s catching!

1039
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:48,501
Hey. This feels Weird sitting here.
It feels like it"s a bribe.

1040
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:53,139
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch,
I saw courtside and I Went blind.

1041
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,511
Come on.

1042
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,683
Call me!

1043
00:55:58,154 --> 00:55:59,951
-Excuse me.
-That Was a trick.

1044
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,422
No more.

1045
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:06,861
Gentlemen, you have a choice.
Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.

1046
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,260
Fantastic! You"re so unbelievable!

1047
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,674
Damn it. He did it again.

1048
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:22,941
-Excuse me.
-No more tickets.

1049
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,946
Mr. Ershon,
I tried to keep them in the Waiting room.

1050
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,279
That"s okay, Susan. Two Glacier Waters
With Mediterranean limes.

1051
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,216
No, no, no. No more Water.
We"re not here for that.

1052
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,345
No, I Was very much looking forward
to having a Water.

1053
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:36,892
-How great is Jersey Boys?
-lt"s not great. It"s fantastic!

1054
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:40,326
You totally undersold it.
The pageantry, the costumes.

1055
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,024
Wow, What a musical.

1056
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,997
Hey. Get over here.

1057
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,295
-What"s Wrong With you?
-What?

1058
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,859
That"s not What We"re here for.

1059
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,864
We"re gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?

1060
00:56:51,174 --> 00:56:54,200
It"s the oldest game in the book for a reason,
it Works.

1061
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,641
I come strong, then you come in.

1062
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,804
-You got it?
-Yeah.

1063
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,542
-I come strong, then you come in.
-Right. Got it.

1064
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:01,549
NoW you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1065
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:04,378
It"s!just you and me,
and l"m gonna rip you apart!

1066
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:08,685
How did you cover your losses up?
What drug cartel are you Working With noW?

1067
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,694
-Okay, l"ll talk to you, you"re reasonable!
-No, no, look at me!

1068
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,230
You Wanna talk to me?
You Wanna talk to me?

1069
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,823
Allen, What are you doing?
What are you doing? Allen!

1070
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:21,899
I"m gonna make you eat
a plate of human shit!

1071
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,369
Get away from me!

1072
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,545
Where is he?

1073
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:35,176
Look, l"m really sorry about that.

1074
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,544
I saw how aggressive you Were being,
and I thought,

1075
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,250
""Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that,
since We"re doing bad cop, bad cop.""

1076
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:47,421
What? No, I said, ""Good cop, bad cop.""
l"m the bad cop, you"re the good cop.

1077
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,933
Okay, then there it is. That"s it.
I thought you said, ""Bad cop, bad cop.""

1078
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,704
Well, While you Were going crazy,
look What I snagged from his desk.

1079
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,865
-Think it"s his phone sheet.
-Nice.

1080
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,903
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1081
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,767
That could be the evidence
We need for Mauch.

1082
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,414
-Get back. Colombian drug lords.
-Where are you getting that from?

1083
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,413
Jesus!

1084
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,663
Can you imagine Where you"d be
in your career if you hadn't"t shot Jeter?

1085
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,805
-We call this in, right?
-Looks like We got all the evidence We need.

1086
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,968
I"m sorry, my butterfly.

1087
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,281
We"ll load them up, send them back to go.

1088
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,323
-Holy shit.
-What?

1089
00:58:51,427 --> 00:58:54,123
What do you mean, What? Where are We?

1090
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,931
We"re in the high desert.

1091
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,766
They took my shoes again, man!
What the hell is it With taking shoes?

1092
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,361
-They took your Wooden gun?
-Yeah.

1093
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,175
-Hello?
-Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.

1094
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,680
Captain, it's Allen Gamble.

1095
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,613
Yeah, yeah. Where are you?
What"s going on?

1096
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,982
Captain, it's a Long story,
but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

1097
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,021
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1098
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,489
We Were kidnapped, put on a freight train,
and shipped out here.

1099
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,993
Let me!just stop you right there.
Don"t bullshit me.

1100
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,460
Captain, I am being straight With you.

1101
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,861
Look, We think something"s going on, okay?

1102
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:31,832
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery
to cover his losses.

1103
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:37,339
Wait. How many times
did I explicitly say to you, ""Lay off Ershon""?

1104
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,137
Terry, Captain Wants to know

1105
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:41,142
how many times
has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.

1106
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,302
Twice.

1107
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,909
Twice. Terry says twice. I agree.

1108
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,073
I"m hanging up. I"m done.

1109
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:55,882
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand
for that, a taste for that Pai Gow.

1110
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:01,189
Martin and Fosse, super cops,
in three, two...

1111
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:07,169
So, We busted that!junkie.
Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.

1112
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,704
Solved the Castien case.

1113
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,570
$74,000? That"s all they took?

1114
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,905
There"s millions of dollars of diamonds
in that place.

1115
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:17,172
How about this, Gamble?
How about you shut your face?

1116
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,838
All right? Just shut it.

1117
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,542
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain"s looking for you.

1118
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,749
I know it"s off the sub!subject,
but is Kevlar copyrighted?

1119
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,117
-Captain?
-Yeah.

1120
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,714
-ls it a bad time?
-No, come on. Come on.

1121
01:00:30,093 --> 01:00:31,924
-Not me, right?
-Yeah, and you.

1122
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:35,725
Fellows, l"m sure you"re familiar With
the venerable DA Radford.

1123
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,459
He Wanted to come down and pay us a visit.

1124
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:38,795
Hello, gentlemen.

1125
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,027
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

1126
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:43,470
-You know, I Was talking to Gene here.
-He prefers ""Captain.""

1127
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:47,065
Yes, I Was talking to Gene here,
and, you know, it"s funny.

1128
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,607
I don"t know What you two have been up to,

1129
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:53,079
but l"'ve been getting calls
from people I don"t ever get calls from.

1130
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:56,084
In 40 years of enforcing the law,
l"'ve learned one thing.

1131
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,414
When that happens, stop.

1132
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,083
-Gene, how"s the family?
-Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.

1133
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,150
-My son"s bisexual, so...
-Tremendous.

1134
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,488
Gentlemen, do We understand each other?

1135
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,961
-Cut the crap!
-Will do.

1136
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,773
Guy never comes down here.

1137
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,674
Twenty years, I think l"'ve seen that guy
in this building one time.

1138
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,941
-He"s a heavyweight cat, that guy.
-He Was sitting right here.

1139
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,784
Yeah. I think you missed the point.
Anyway, look.

1140
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,287
Blue and White found your firearms down
by the Hudson River. Here you go, Terry.

1141
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,446
You know What?

1142
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,093
I"m gonna hang on to the Wooden gun.

1143
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,026
-To give me back my real gun?
-No.

1144
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,188
"Cause l"m gonna give you this.

1145
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:46,095
It"s a rape Whistle.
You blow that if you run into any trouble

1146
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,263
and someone With an actual gun
Will come and help you out.

1147
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:55,304
We Were abducted, Captain! This shit is real!
Ershon"s dirty. He"s targeting the lottery!

1148
01:01:55,378 --> 01:02:00,281
Next, I Want you guys to hand in all
the evidence you think you have to the SEC.

1149
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,180
The financial district"s
under their!jurisdiction.

1150
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:04,753
Don"t you get it? This case is talking to us!

1151
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,949
I"m a peacock, Captain!
You gotta let me fly on this one!

1152
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,925
You know What, Terry? Let"s!just settle this.
Peacocks don"t fly.

1153
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,451
-They fly, they fly a little bit.
-Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1154
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:18,159
One more thing, do me a favor,
don"t go chasing Waterfalls.

1155
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:21,428
Was that accidental, or Were you trying
to quote TLC on purpose?

1156
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,329
I don"t even understand the reference.

1157
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,000
-You don"t understand What you said?
-I don"t know What that is.

1158
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,542
Get out. Go.

1159
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,517
How did they get that story?

1160
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,027
I"m tired of being treated like a!jerk
for trying to do the right thing.

1161
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,186
Hey, guys.

1162
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:50,464
There"s a proxy vote for a big reinvestment
of the pension coming up,

1163
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,400
-so if you!just Wanna come by the old...
-Damn it, Bob!

1164
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,561
Let me ask you something.

1165
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,070
What do you even do around here
besides interrupt people?

1166
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,174
Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1167
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,076
I make a Wicked pot of decaf.

1168
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:06,410
Exactly! You"re a Worthless piece of shit!

1169
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,878
Probably right, Terry.
That"s Why I feel so sad all the time.

1170
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,586
I"m gonna go for a Walk.

1171
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:15,952
-Bob!
-Say something.

1172
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,923
Come on! Bob!

1173
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,928
I didn'"t mean it, all right? I"m upset.

1174
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:43,845
Actually, We don"t do that here.
This is an installation art piece.

1175
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,313
-This coffee table?
-Yes. We don"t put drinks on it.

1176
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,754
-Five hundred thousand?
-He can read! Congratulations.

1177
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:55,390
-What?
-l"m sorry, are you in the right place?

1178
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:57,762
Or not? I"m...

1179
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,162
-Terry.
-Does he... Okay.

1180
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:03,501
-Well...
-Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?

1181
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,109
-I Want to be With you.
-No, Terry, that"s not gonna happen.

1182
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:12,106
You know Where you belong.
On top of me in the Poconos.

1183
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,974
Instead, you"re here
selling dirty coffee tables?

1184
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,709
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!

1185
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,220
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1186
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:23,787
The chaos of the coffee table?
It represents our fractured egos.

1187
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,251
You think I don"t know
about this artsy-fartsy crap?

1188
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:31,089
This coffee table isn't"t the ego. It represents
our shattered sense of community

1189
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,197
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1190
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:36,062
Looks like the Work of Cindy Sherman
or Frank Stella.

1191
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:38,036
How did you know that, Terry?

1192
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:39,906
I took some classes at RlSD

1193
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:42,308
so I could make fun of these lame artsy
douches in my neighborhood.

1194
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,778
-Terry, lower your voice!
-I don"t have to lower my voice.

1195
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,645
-ls this man bothering you?
-Are you actually having sex With this creep?

1196
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,815
Terry, he"s gay. Okay?

1197
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,749
He"s even Wearing a T-shirt that says,
""l"m gay""!

1198
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,888
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1199
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,385
Happy for you, man. Good.

1200
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,325
Can you get out of here noW?
I"m talking to my lady.

1201
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:02,861
Mr. Reger, everything is fine.
Terry is actually leaving noW.

1202
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,358
Nice toot, sailor. Jesus.

1203
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,536
Terry, What are you doing?

1204
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:12,439
Look, I Waited three years
for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1205
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,003
Just give me one more year.

1206
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,843
Terry, you don"t get another year. I"m done.

1207
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,404
Fine.

1208
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:22,078
-Terry, don"t touch that! Terry!
-Oh, my God!

1209
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,352
I don"t need this shit. I don"t need you!

1210
01:05:25,354 --> 01:05:27,447
And When you call me, l"m not coming back!

1211
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,784
-Oh, boy! Over the top!
-How outre!

1212
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,288
I"ll burn this bitch down to the ground!

1213
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,896
-Fresh! Energetic!
-I love his rawness!

1214
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:41,828
Stop critiquing me, okay?
I"m a human being! I"m not a piece of art!

1215
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,969
-Yes, you are.
-Bravo!

1216
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,003
I"m a peacock flying into a rainbow!

1217
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,770
Yes! Yes!

1218
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,982
These braised short ribs taste
like a dog"s asshole.

1219
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,786
-Sweetie.
-You know What, l"m sitting here thinking,

1220
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:07,056
""Who in the World Would slow roast
a dog"s asshole

1221
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,097
""and serve it to their husband?""

1222
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,601
-You Would.
-You are being awful. What"s Wrong?

1223
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:17,401
-Captain took us off the case.
-l"m sorry.

1224
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:23,142
I told Terry about my dark days in college,
and it brought up some feelings.

1225
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:28,779
Well, honeydick, that Was a long time ago.
You"re not that same person you Were.

1226
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:32,320
No, you don"t get it.
There is a darkness inside of me.

1227
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,413
It Wants to get out. It Wants to Walk around.

1228
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,619
It Wants some Walking around money,
and it Wants to buy some shoes.

1229
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:43,256
And it Wants to Walk up With the people
and say, ""Hey, Gator don"t play no shit.""

1230
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:44,964
-You feel me?
-Yeah.

1231
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:49,128
Gator never been about that,
never been about playing no shit.

1232
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,165
-Sweetie, l"m sorry.
-lt"s okay.

1233
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,177
-l!just...
-Remember that night We met?

1234
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:03,612
The attending physician told me,
""We got a drugged-out pimp in the back.""

1235
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,789
And I Went back there,
and I pulled open that curtain,

1236
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,415
and I saw you.

1237
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:12,491
You Were Weak, scared,

1238
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:17,158
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1239
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:22,363
At that moment, I knew.
""Hey, he"s no pimp. Pimps don"t cry.""

1240
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:27,833
Pimps don't cry

1241
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:31,670
Pimps don't cry

1242
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:34,682
No, they don't

1243
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,020
They don't shed a tear

1244
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:44,057
Pimps don't cry

1245
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,226
They never shed a tear

1246
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:54,569
Come lay With me.
Be safe, and let"s make love. Come on.

1247
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,070
Every time you say, ""Be safe,""
it tears me apart.

1248
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:59,733
You gotta let me be Who l"m gonna be.

1249
01:08:01,343 --> 01:08:03,834
Allen, l"m pregnant.

1250
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,078
Whose baby is that?

1251
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:09,640
Who"s the man Who did that to you?
Gator"s bitches better be using!jimmies!

1252
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,547
I"m sorry. See, that"s What l"m talking about.

1253
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,249
Oh, my God.

1254
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,559
You need to leave.

1255
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:23,257
Get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!

1256
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:40,947
Hey.

1257
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,743
Hey. What are you doing here?

1258
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:52,286
Come here When I have lady troubles,
Which means I come here about every night.

1259
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,419
What are you doing here?

1260
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,089
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1261
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:01,266
She threw me out.

1262
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:05,364
Well, you"re not a cop till your Wife
throws you out of the house, partner.

1263
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:09,275
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers
only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1264
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,080
They"re!junkies. Who cares? I mean...

1265
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,948
I don"t know if a!junkie can go down
a 20-story zipline, though.

1266
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:16,949
How you fellas doing?

1267
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:21,784
We"re about to have us a little screw party
in this red Prius over here

1268
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,085
if you Wanna!join us.

1269
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,251
You"re not going
anywhere near that Prius, okay?

1270
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,461
Here"s What We"re talking about.
We"re talking about a bunch of hobos

1271
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,832
With fingers in each other"s pooper

1272
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,698
in a stranger"s car
With talk radio playing really loud.

1273
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:34,929
It"s gonna be a nice evening.

1274
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,602
Well, We"re not participating in that.
We have no interest.

1275
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:38,898
Let me rephrase it.

1276
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:42,141
We got a!ar of old mustard,
and We got a poodle,

1277
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,507
and We"re!just get in there
and We"re gonna put some D"s in some A"s.

1278
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,679
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?

1279
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,275
-How do you know Who We are?
-You left a note in that car.

1280
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,946
-Police, shithead.
-He"s a copper. We gotta go. Come on!

1281
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,886
Hey! Goose it, boys! They"re cops!

1282
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,120
Rub your dicks on the car
as you"re running away!

1283
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,525
You turned my beautiful Prius
into a nightmare!

1284
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:03,291
We are gonna have sex in your car!
It Will happen again!

1285
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,129
I don"t know Where l"m gonna sleep tonight.

1286
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,000
Fortunately, I know
Where you"re gonna be drinking.

1287
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,436
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.

1288
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,669
-No, I already have a beer.
-No, no, no, no.

1289
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:16,341
I"m talking about doing
some serious drinking.

1290
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,776
Drinking With Terry Hoitz.

1291
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,527
This sucks, man.
Work our ass off on this case,

1292
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,189
noW We gotta hand over
all of our evidence?

1293
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,528
Yeah, it"s not right.

1294
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,659
Oh, my God, l"m hungover.

1295
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:16,801
So, you guys are law enforcement?

1296
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,407
Yeah, We"re an independent
government agency Who,

1297
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,375
along With the FBl and the Federal Reserve,

1298
01:11:21,443 --> 01:11:23,604
regulate the stock market
and corporate fraud.

1299
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,574
And the Federal Reserve is a prison?

1300
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,579
No, basically, it"s a held-for-profit bank
that sets interest rates

1301
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:30,778
and loans money to other banks.

1302
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,815
-ls that a Wastebasket?
-Yeah, right there.

1303
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,287
Thank you.

1304
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:40,325
-You all right?
-Holy hell!

1305
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,659
I"m so sorry.

1306
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:45,631
I got so drunk last night.

1307
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:49,602
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste
Was astronaut food.

1308
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,470
Come on in, fellas.

1309
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,770
You gotta be kidding me.
You"re Ershon"s lawyer.

1310
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,607
We"re turning over our investigation to you?

1311
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,277
Let me assure you there Will be
no conflict of interest

1312
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:01,816
between me and David Ershon.

1313
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:06,013
And if this Were an actual investigation,
I Would immediately recuse myself.

1314
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:10,353
This is all the evidence We have,
and I truly hope you take this seriously.

1315
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,756
Yes. Very much so.

1316
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,590
From everything l"'ve heard, I understand

1317
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,927
you guys are the best
at these types of investigations.

1318
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,763
Outside of Enron and AlG

1319
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,302
and Bernie Madoff,

1320
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:24,633
WorldCom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.

1321
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:26,607
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.

1322
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,472
-Would you like a seat, or you"re fine?
-No, l"m good.

1323
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,171
Okay. Let me!just assure you fellas,

1324
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,137
David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.

1325
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,645
I am playing squash With him
tonight at the club,

1326
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:36,548
and We"re having dinner.

1327
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,212
You listen to me,
you Windsor knot-Wearing monkey,

1328
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,380
you play squash With Ershon, right?

1329
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:44,721
Your kids go to school With his?
How Would you know if he"s clean or not?

1330
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:46,488
I Will take a look at your evidence,

1331
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:47,790
and I Will take a second look
at the financials.

1332
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,556
And When I come back and bust your ass,

1333
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,157
We"re locking David Ershon
in the Federal Reserve!

1334
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,702
He still doesn't"t understand the concept.

1335
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,649
What are you doing?

1336
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:21,492
We!just handed all of our evidence over
to the bad guy"s lawyer!

1337
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,827
Are you a big man, huh?

1338
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,366
-l"m talking to you.
-What?

1339
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:28,298
You Wake up in the morning, you say,
""l"m putting on my big boy pants""?

1340
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,598
""Look, l"m Wearing a belt!

1341
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:31,832
-""l"'ve got big boy pants on!""
-No!

1342
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,837
You borrow a little!jacket, you go?

1343
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,101
You take your lunch
"cause you got big boy pants on?

1344
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,443
You got your big boy pants and your snack?

1345
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,841
I could say big, loud things!

1346
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:42,749
I could be demonstrative!

1347
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,985
-Stop!
-We don"t, We don"t do this!

1348
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,180
You"re scaring the shit out of me, man!
Stop it!

1349
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:50,486
Is this how you conduct yourself?
In a democracy?

1350
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,253
What the hell are you doing, man?

1351
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:57,097
I"m so tired of you getting angry
and yelling all the time.

1352
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,661
It"s exhausting.

1353
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,669
I feel like l"m partners With the Hulk.

1354
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,597
You Wanna know Why
l"m so angry all the time?

1355
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:10,042
"Cause the more I try and do right,
the more I screw things up.

1356
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:15,807
We've got a possible jumper
at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.

1357
01:14:15,884 --> 01:14:18,148
ALL units, fire department, en route.

1358
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,347
-SEC.
-Beaman"s office.

1359
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:21,981
We have to go.

1360
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:23,954
-But the Captain.
-We have to go, Allen.

1361
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:28,725
ALL units, I need a respondent.
Possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.

1362
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,070
Shit. It"s Beaman!

1363
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:45,711
-He"s gotta know something.
-Wesley!

1364
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:47,812
Detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.

1365
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,343
I took an online class
at University of Phoenix on negotiating.

1366
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,080
I"m gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.

1367
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:55,554
-I got no bullhorn.
-Does anyone have a bullhorn?

1368
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,852
-Bullhorn, anyone?
-Truck.

1369
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,885
Police business.
I need to use your PA system.

1370
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:02,224
Okay, let me turn it on.

1371
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,999
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?

1372
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:10,266
It"s Wesley. I know Ershon"s Wesley"s...

1373
01:15:10,372 --> 01:15:13,205
Look, there's a Lot to Live for in this Life.

1374
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:18,338
A Lot of great things, Like soda pop,
big fresh can of soda pop.

1375
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,778
They do not care!

1376
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,180
Give me this. I know how to talk to him.

1377
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:25,914
Listen, we all know you're a scumbag,
and nobody cares about you.

1378
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,352
Rotten piece of shit.

1379
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,390
That"s Worse than What I Was saying.

1380
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,383
I'm not gonna Lie to you, Don.

1381
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,226
People down here are starting to murmur
that you don't have the balls to do it.

1382
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,622
-I don"t care!
-Yeah.

1383
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,065
I say you can do it.

1384
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:44,795
I mean, I don't want you to jump.
I'm just saying you have the capability.

1385
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,465
Look, he"s flying!

1386
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,442
Stop that.

1387
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,081
Half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.

1388
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:59,143
Look at this, it"s a clear sign of a struggle.
Make sure you get this, all right?

1389
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:02,889
Detectives, all your Work"s done here.
You can go.

1390
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:04,550
What about Ershon targeting the lottery?

1391
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:08,790
You know Why Ershon Was calling down
to the lottery offices all those times?

1392
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,888
Because he Was hooking up
With the Power ball girl,

1393
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,264
the one on TV With all the numbered balls.

1394
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,529
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him
last Week.

1395
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,869
It Was right there in front of you
the Whole time.

1396
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,908
-Can"t be.
-You guys are getting transferred.

1397
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,102
-What?
-Traffic.

1398
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:23,302
Yeah, that"s right.

1399
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:27,075
You, you"re gonna Walk a beat downtown.
You"re gonna Walk a beat downtown.

1400
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:29,481
-lt"s done. No, no. It"s done.
-Captain, What are you talking about?

1401
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,450
-Save yourselves some gas.
-Captain!

1402
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,386
Is there an appeal process We can...

1403
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:36,618
Had to do What you had to do, Captain.

1404
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,920
Wow! That hurt.

1405
01:16:41,063 --> 01:16:43,224
-Excuse me. Where"s my car?
-They towed it.

1406
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,766
Couple of homeless people
Were messing around in it.

1407
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:49,497
-That"s an official police car.
-Could have fooled me.

1408
01:16:54,643 --> 01:16:55,940
Wow, Mauch Was upset, huh?

1409
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,638
Really?

1410
01:16:57,746 --> 01:17:00,112
The only thing I had to be proud of
in my life Was being a detective.

1411
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,742
That Was all I had. NoW it"s gone.

1412
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,976
I know. I know. You still got me.

1413
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:09,615
Don"t you get it?
I don"t Want you, Allen, okay? I never did.

1414
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:11,921
I told you that scaffolding violation
Was dogshit.

1415
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:14,353
I can"t believe you still doubt me
after everything We"'ve seen.

1416
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:18,991
It"s a real case, and l"m a real cop.
We!just got the Wrong target for Ershon.

1417
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,331
-You carry a rape Whistle.
-This is real cop Work.

1418
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:24,269
There is nothing about you
that makes a man a man, okay?

1419
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:27,775
You got no gun, no car, no Wife,
and noW you got no partner.

1420
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,435
Leave me alone.

1421
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,535
A mutt case.

1422
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,172
Terry, I am a cop,
for your information, okay?

1423
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,443
A broken partnership.

1424
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,644
I"m a cop!

1425
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:41,382
And getting busted down
to a shitty assignment.

1426
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,550
Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

1427
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,389
But sometimes
when you get your ass kicked,

1428
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,329
that's when you find out what's real...

1429
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,697
...and what needs doing.

1430
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,705
Whether it's directing traffic...

1431
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:07,839
Come on!

1432
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:11,752
... or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.

1433
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,324
-Do you Work here?
-Yeah, I do.

1434
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,233
The Wrecking ball that crashed into Castien
down there.

1435
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:29,894
They also did damage to your office?

1436
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,530
Some police officers came by
and sealed it off.

1437
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:33,938
Do you recall What they looked like?

1438
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,738
One of them had an Australian accent.

1439
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:41,079
You don"t happen to do any business
for the state lottery, do you?

1440
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:44,550
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1441
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,246
Can I ask What this is about?

1442
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:01,931
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!

1443
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,406
'Cause that's what a real cop is.

1444
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,973
No, I didn'"t say ""Lock her up.""
I never said, ""Lock her up.""

1445
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,882
A guy who does what needs to be done.

1446
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:22,913
A guy who knows how to use his dark side
for good.

1447
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,618
And then you move to Florida.

1448
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,061
One, two, three, attack!

1449
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,967
Terry, it"s me.

1450
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,304
-Tap out. Tap out.
-lt"s me, Allen.

1451
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:42,967
Are you tapping out,
or are you hitting me in the face?

1452
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,739
I"m tapping out!

1453
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,640
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1454
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,183
-They might be Watching us.
-Could"'ve killed you.

1455
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,411
-Turn out the lights.
-What?

1456
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:52,578
-They could be Watching us.
-Who?

1457
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:55,446
I found some big information, okay?

1458
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:58,652
-About What?
-Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1459
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,758
How"d you get in here?
This place is foolproof.

1460
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:04,298
-We can"t be too careful.
-What are you talking about?

1461
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,529
-This place might be bugged.
-There"s no bugs in here.

1462
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,799
First off, I missed you.

1463
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:17,674
-What"s going on?
-Did you hear What I said?

1464
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,772
-Fine, I kind of missed you, too.
-Thank you.

1465
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:26,150
Okay. I found out Whose losses
Ershon has to cover.

1466
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,519
-lt"s Lendl Global.
-What?

1467
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:31,148
Lendl staged the Castien robbery
as a distraction

1468
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:34,218
so they could break into
their own accounting firm next door.

1469
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:37,526
They then altered all the records
to cover the losses

1470
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,396
that Ershon had cost them
through all of his bad investments.

1471
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,968
You"re not supposed to be doing this.
You"re supposed to be Walking the beat.

1472
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,633
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1473
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,167
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1474
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:51,712
No Wonder the captain Wanted us
to stay out of this.

1475
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,906
Yeah, I bet
Beaman started asking questions.

1476
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,983
-That"s Why they killed him.
-Man.

1477
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,211
Here"s the other thing.

1478
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,310
Tomorrow, there"s a massive
business deal going down.

1479
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,886
Ershon"s leading it.

1480
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:03,856
I still can"t figure out Who the poor sucker is
they"re making the deal With,

1481
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,085
but We gotta stop it.

1482
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:06,854
It"s time to let the peacock fly.

1483
01:21:07,896 --> 01:21:09,761
I"m not going, Allen. I like What I do.

1484
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:12,325
So do l. We"re cops.

1485
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,928
No. I like What I do noW.
I like Working traffic. It"s a great gig.

1486
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,062
What?

1487
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:22,439
I like Working traffic. I"m not going With you.

1488
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,035
What is this traffic bullshit?

1489
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:32,377
-What are you talking about?
-l"m talking about my life.

1490
01:21:32,454 --> 01:21:35,184
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue?
It hums.

1491
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:38,954
It"s Terry"s intersection.
And the traffic guys? They"re good guys.

1492
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:42,086
There"s this one guy, Phillip?
He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.

1493
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:43,357
You"''ve gotta see it, Allen. You"''ve got to.

1494
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:46,059
What happened to you?
What happened to this being our time?

1495
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,529
No Way, Allen. I"m out. I"m done.

1496
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:52,638
-Get in the car.
-Come on, Allen. We both know it"s Wooden.

1497
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:58,043
-Apartment pop. NoW get in the car.
-You"re not gonna shoot me.

1498
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:00,638
Okay, l"ll be honest. This is only
the second time l"'ve ever fired this.

1499
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:02,076
So stop pointing it at me.

1500
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:06,211
Look, tomorrow morning,
all I know is l"m going to Mauch, all right?

1501
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:07,614
For What? He doesn't"t care.

1502
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:10,885
He"s been dodging this case for too long
and I Want answers.

1503
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:13,223
I Want him to look me in the eye
and tell me Why.

1504
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:16,093
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1505
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,130
I hope l"m not alone.

1506
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,459
Hope you bring it.

1507
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,298
We got a big day out there. Big one.

1508
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,898
We got a full moon.
People are gonna be amped, all right?

1509
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,767
Let"s see What We got on hot tips, all right?

1510
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:33,406
The new bathmats are in.

1511
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:40,449
One more thing.
We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.

1512
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:44,014
Jeez, l"m sorry. That"s from my other!ob.
Ignore that. Forget that.

1513
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:45,285
Well, don"t ignore it.

1514
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,591
If you live in Crown Heights,
you know, Walk in pairs.

1515
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:52,997
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.

1516
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:56,696
I gotta go. Go get "em.
Let"s be careful out there.

1517
01:22:58,773 --> 01:22:59,933
The oak.

1518
01:23:00,008 --> 01:23:03,535
I like to keep the oak together
and the maple separately, okay?

1519
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:04,703
And these chopping boards?

1520
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,038
Hey, Captain.

1521
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:10,007
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1522
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:11,881
What are you doing here?
Are you here for the bathmats?

1523
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:16,050
-I need you to be straight With me.
-Straight With us.

1524
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:18,853
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1525
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,623
-I thought you Were Working traffic today.
-Let them block the box.

1526
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:26,489
-Besides, partners" code, right?
-Thanks.

1527
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,630
Hey, Why have you Worked your ass off
trying to kill this case?

1528
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:35,167
All right, fine.
I"m gonna tell you guys something.

1529
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:38,542
You really Went into deep Water on this one.
You really Went in deep.

1530
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:40,580
Ershon"s connected to all the higher ups,

1531
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:43,549
and I gotta save
What little ass I have left, okay?

1532
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,346
You keep hiding from shit in the World,

1533
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:48,685
and eventually the World
comes to your front door.

1534
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,387
-Nice.
-That"s very nice.

1535
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,051
I heard it in an episode
of Touched By An Angel.

1536
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:57,588
You keep this thing real quiet,
and you make sure you have real evidence,

1537
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,257
and maybe l"ll see What I can do.

1538
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,561
But if you make a lot of noise

1539
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:03,831
and you attract the media attention,
and you bring the DA in on this,

1540
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,429
I am out, okay?

1541
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:06,870
Yeah, We"ll go in there like church mice.

1542
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:11,344
But there"s one case,
one case in a career Where you go all in.

1543
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,539
This is it.

1544
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:16,447
All right. Then you do us proud.

1545
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,248
"Cause I don"t Want no scrubs.

1546
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:21,513
-Really?
-No.

1547
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:24,922
-You"re not aware that"s a TLC song?
-I have no idea What you"re talking about.

1548
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:26,592
-Second time.
-You said chasing Waterfalls,

1549
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:27,854
noW you"re saying you don"t Want no scrubs.

1550
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:29,726
-I don"t even understand the reference.
-lt"s like a tic.

1551
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:30,924
I have no idea What you"re talking about.

1552
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:33,296
Remember, this thing gets messy,
We never talked.

1553
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,430
-You can trust us.
-Real quiet.

1554
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:37,801
You gotta creep. Creep.

1555
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,370
Come on.

1556
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:42,799
You don"t say ""Creep-creep""
unless you"re quoting TLC.

1557
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,443
Hey, guys.

1558
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:47,278
You know Danson and Highsmith
Were not good cops, right?

1559
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,746
Yeah, I guess We kind of knew that,
but it"s a drag.

1560
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,718
I mean, at a certain point,
Who"s left to be a hero?

1561
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:55,216
Not to be corny, maybe it"s you guys.

1562
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,216
You ready?

1563
01:24:58,293 --> 01:24:59,954
-Yeah.
-Let"s go.

1564
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,836
-No, but the highlights are great.
-Thank you.

1565
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,998
-Sexy but serious.
-Thank you.

1566
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,473
Excuse me.

1567
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:18,139
Who the hell are all these people?
I Was only expecting one man.

1568
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:22,740
You know, they"re!just some people
I owe money to Who Wanted to be here.

1569
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:23,909
Who are they?

1570
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:30,119
Well, they are some Chechen patriots,
entrepreneurs.

1571
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:36,027
And the black chaps
are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1572
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:38,326
You owe money
to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1573
01:25:38,433 --> 01:25:39,923
Yes. Yes, I do.

1574
01:25:40,001 --> 01:25:43,164
-You"re a piece of Work.
-Thank you.

1575
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,705
Probably best to get started.

1576
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:50,600
This is good, baby.
We"re in the game, We know the score.

1577
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:53,613
The only thing that bugs me is
We still don"t know Who Ershon"s targeting.

1578
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:57,777
-ls it the lotto? Who is it?
-Who cares? Some rich prick.

1579
01:25:57,852 --> 01:26:03,813
I have to tell you,
I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1580
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,360
And I can assure you
that every dime of your money

1581
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:09,487
Will be invested With the utmost diligence.

1582
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:11,532
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1583
01:26:11,633 --> 01:26:13,157
We think our members
are gonna be!just thrilled.

1584
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:17,068
Yeah. I mean, We"'ve averaged,
like, 18%% over the last 10 years.

1585
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,368
All right.
Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1586
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,705
I can feel that tingling in my balls
you Were talking about.

1587
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:23,868
Beautiful.

1588
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,377
All right, listen up.

1589
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,381
I am Detective Gamble.
This is Detective Hoitz.

1590
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,644
We need your cooperation.

1591
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,185
David Ershon.

1592
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,585
You"re under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,

1593
01:26:34,689 --> 01:26:36,384
and in connection
to the murder of Don Beaman.

1594
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:38,324
This is a bad idea.

1595
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,191
Hey, guys.

1596
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:44,231
Bob? What are you doing here?

1597
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,030
I"m investing.

1598
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,534
Do you remember We talked about
that proxy vote a While back?

1599
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:50,230
-This is What it Was for.
-Holy shit.

1600
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:52,863
It"s a more aggressive investment strategy
for the pension.

1601
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:57,173
Allen! We"re the suckers.
They"re targeting the police pension fund.

1602
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:07,147
Gentlemen, you"re here illegally
and Without a Warrant.

1603
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,523
We are Within our rights to take action.

1604
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,712
So much for quiet as church mice!

1605
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,377
Go!

1606
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:17,889
Who the hell are those guys?

1607
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,019
Gentlemen, I can get you
obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.

1608
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:25,054
Even I admit that"s not very tempting,
but l"m not made of tickets, God damn it!

1609
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:27,101
-Get in the front!
-How do you start this freaking thing?

1610
01:28:27,368 --> 01:28:28,357
Go on! Go!

1611
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:30,092
-Shit!
-Go!

1612
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:33,562
Oh, my...

1613
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,843
Jeanie! Get over here!
You, go get the bloody car!

1614
01:29:24,425 --> 01:29:25,414
Hold the Wheel!

1615
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,498
-Open the back!
-I got it. I got it!

1616
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:44,444
They"re gonna kill me.
And then they Will kill you.

1617
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:46,945
-Well, l"m gonna kill you first!
-And then they Will kill me.

1618
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:50,074
We have two rogue police officers.
They are armed and dangerous,

1619
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,845
-and holding David Ershon hostage.
-Stupid pricks!

1620
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:55,411
-lt"s us, We"re good guys!
-Exactly. They"re the good guys.

1621
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:57,684
Where do We go? Where do We go?

1622
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,421
I have a small apartment.
No one knows about it.

1623
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,224
I use it mainly for my parents
and prostitutes.

1624
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,390
Not at the same time. That Would be Wrong.

1625
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:11,332
Let"s hear it from the top, every detail.

1626
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:16,536
I think the best Way to tell the story
is by starting at the end, briefly,

1627
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:21,605
then going back to the beginning,
and then periodically returning to the end,

1628
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:24,776
maybe giving different characters"
perspectives throughout.

1629
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:28,185
Just to give it a bit of dynamism,
otherwise, it"s!just sort of a linear story.

1630
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,416
Just tell us What happened.

1631
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:32,254
I lost a bunch of money from some people
and noW they Want it back.

1632
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:33,890
What about Don Beaman?

1633
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,452
Beaman knew
that I had falsified my financials,

1634
01:30:36,564 --> 01:30:38,862
so they sent down Wesley
to try and keep him quiet.

1635
01:30:39,567 --> 01:30:41,432
He forced him at gunpoint
to drink a bunch of gin

1636
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,561
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1637
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,367
It Was only a matter of time before he fell.

1638
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,876
At least We stopped you
from getting the pension fund.

1639
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:52,208
Well, but, yeah, but you didn'"t.
It"s already in my account.

1640
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,874
By 9:00 in the morning,
it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1641
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:57,645
and from there it"s transferred
to a dozen offshore accounts.

1642
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,276
By 9:01, it"s gone.

1643
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:02,379
-Well, What if We stop the transfer?
-But you can"t. I mean, there"s a...

1644
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,925
What if We stop the transfer?

1645
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,893
You"d have to be at Endemic Bank
for 9:00 exactly,

1646
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:10,430
find the clerk,
get the routing number.

1647
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:11,556
We gotta stop it.

1648
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:12,826
There"s no Way.

1649
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:16,563
Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew,
they"ll all be after us.

1650
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:20,733
You could let me go,
and l"ll give you $10 million each.

1651
01:31:21,342 --> 01:31:24,402
-lt"s not a bribe.
-Of course it"s a bribe.

1652
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,606
You"re offering to pay us money
to not do our!ob.

1653
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:29,945
It"s not a bribe.

1654
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:32,985
We hang low here tonight.
Nobody knows about this place.

1655
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:34,816
We"ll be safe. And tomorrow, We hit it.

1656
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,114
First things first, I gotta go see Sheila.

1657
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:38,590
No Way, it"s too dangerous.

1658
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:40,991
Look, Terry, We don"t know
What"s gonna happen to us tomorrow,

1659
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:44,622
but tonight,
I need to make things right With Sheila.

1660
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:47,032
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1661
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,129
Thanks, I Will.

1662
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,199
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1663
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:53,135
-Okay.
-Okay.

1664
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:56,176
Tell her. Say Terry Was asking about you.

1665
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:57,710
He Wants to make sure you know

1666
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:00,178
that he"ll be there for you
if anything happens.

1667
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,340
-Yeah.
-Drop of a hat, l"m there.

1668
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,541
Look, it"s starting to get a little Weird, man.

1669
01:32:04,652 --> 01:32:07,553
If something happens to you,
I need to be there to take care of her.

1670
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:10,556
All of her Wants, her needs,
and desires are noW my responsibility.

1671
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:12,819
Why do you say it
like it"s a predetermined thing?

1672
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,392
Just go, man.

1673
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:16,619
Okay. Thanks.

1674
01:32:17,565 --> 01:32:18,657
Go.

1675
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:23,797
Janeco Gallery.

1676
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:26,832
Francine, it"s Terry. Please don"t hang up.

1677
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:38,712
Please pick up.

1678
01:32:39,587 --> 01:32:40,747
Hello.

1679
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:44,018
Hey, sweetie.
I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.

1680
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:47,356
You know What, I can"t talk anymore.
I think the phone"s being tapped.

1681
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:50,086
Baby, Where are you? I Wanna see you.

1682
01:32:50,197 --> 01:32:52,358
I"m near the place Where We did it
three Halloweens ago.

1683
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:53,491
Do you remember?

1684
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:55,834
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1685
01:32:55,903 --> 01:32:59,532
I"m!just Warning you, though. Watch out.
I think they"re Watching the house.

1686
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,201
Don't worry, sweetie.
I think I have a way of talking to you.

1687
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:06,679
I have to admit, I wasn't"t gonna come.
I mean...

1688
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:11,284
After all those years,
after the restraining order.

1689
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:14,752
I Was Worried I might not see you again.

1690
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:16,447
There"s some
very dangerous people after him,

1691
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:17,581
and noW they"re after us.

1692
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,194
It"s!just the old lady.

1693
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,201
Hello, Allen.

1694
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,864
Hello, Mama Ramos.
What are you doing out here?

1695
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,033
Sheila said she doesn't"t know What happened
and she Wants you back.

1696
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:38,242
-She also says...
-Yes.

1697
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:42,146
...she Wants you on top of her,
holding her hair,

1698
01:33:42,249 --> 01:33:44,274
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1699
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:48,548
While she sucks your thumb and says,
""Mommy likey.""

1700
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,948
You, you tell your daughter...

1701
01:33:51,325 --> 01:33:53,759
He said he"ll always love you.

1702
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:56,490
And he"s so happy
that you"re having his child.

1703
01:33:56,597 --> 01:33:57,757
Allen.

1704
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,663
He also says that

1705
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:03,794
he Wants you to stare into each other"s eyes
Without blinking While you do it.

1706
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:06,963
-I love When We do that, Mom.
-And then afterward,

1707
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,009
Lick the sex off each other.

1708
01:34:10,878 --> 01:34:12,778
I don"t Wanna do this.

1709
01:34:14,181 --> 01:34:17,582
-You say things that are too personal.
-Okay, but!just one more thing.

1710
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:19,852
She said she loves you,

1711
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,014
and Wants to hold your hand
and have iced tea With you.

1712
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:26,216
Come on. That"s not all she said.

1713
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:27,888
No.

1714
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:32,558
-She says other things, but I don"t Want...
-Please, please, please.

1715
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:34,897
You don"t realize, I may be killed tomorrow.

1716
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:36,563
Okay.

1717
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:43,975
She says she Wants to unplug all the clocks
and the phones

1718
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:47,276
-and have a three-day F marathon.
-That"s more like it. Yeah.

1719
01:34:47,581 --> 01:34:52,712
She Wants to Walk Wrong for a Week
because you guys F"d so hard.

1720
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:54,015
That"s!just lovely.

1721
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:58,051
No more! He says things I can"t say.

1722
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:03,893
It involves a mannequin hand
and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1723
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,498
NoW What"d she say?

1724
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:17,739
She says she loves you.

1725
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:26,316
I"m so sorry about everything.

1726
01:35:29,457 --> 01:35:32,626
And l!just had to come here tonight
to tell you that I love you.

1727
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:35,595
And the reason Why I act like
you"re a plain Wife is that

1728
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:41,325
I"m afraid that if I admit to how stunning

1729
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:44,233
and intelligent and Wonderful you are,

1730
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:48,940
-l"d!just lose you.
-Shut up, Allen. I love you.

1731
01:35:49,443 --> 01:35:52,241
We have a place that"s safe. All right.

1732
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:06,020
I"m gonna break your hip.

1733
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:17,100
I"m about to do you grandpa-style.

1734
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,147
I brought some music.

1735
01:36:38,659 --> 01:36:40,650
Not What I Would"'ve chosen, but screw it.

1736
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:43,993
All right. Let"s go, Monday morning,
time to go to Work.

1737
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,190
Let"s do it.

1738
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:47,028
-You Want my gate code?
-Shut up, man!

1739
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:55,667
That"s Wesley!

1740
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:07,812
Yes!

1741
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,749
-Where"d you learn to drive like that?
-Grand Theft Auto!

1742
01:37:15,696 --> 01:37:16,924
Shit, Allen, they"re coming.

1743
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:22,394
-Oh, my God!
-Shit.

1744
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:25,366
-Do something, Allen!
-Hold on, hold on.

1745
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,658
Someone"s been playing Grand Theft Auto.

1746
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:51,762
I did that!

1747
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,527
-I did that!
-Oh, my God!

1748
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,899
-That"s What l"m talking about!
-We!jackknifed them!

1749
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,461
Did you see that? It Went backwards
and then turned upside-down.

1750
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:02,133
Gator turns vans upside-down like
they"re in a crazy Washing machine!

1751
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:04,177
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1752
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:07,509
It"s a nickname I had in college.
I used to run a dating service.

1753
01:38:07,581 --> 01:38:10,778
-He Was a pimp.
-Yeah, I Was. I Was a pimp.

1754
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:13,386
Is it me or does it smell
like deer vagina in here?

1755
01:38:14,421 --> 01:38:15,547
My poor car.

1756
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,358
Right noW the streets are a bloodbath.

1757
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:21,553
And, statistically speaking,
there"s about 30 kids in here,

1758
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:23,653
10 of you are gonna be dead
before your next birthday.

1759
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:27,024
Got a couple of tips,
help you guys stay out of!ail.

1760
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:31,366
One, try your hardest
to not be black or Hispanic.

1761
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:33,702
-lt"s a good tip.
-Yeah. Two...

1762
01:38:33,807 --> 01:38:35,104
Gentlemen, we got a hot one.

1763
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:38,804
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage,
high-speed car chase in progress.

1764
01:38:38,879 --> 01:38:40,847
Yes! Gun, gun!

1765
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:42,882
Pass up the guns. Pass them up.
Let"s go, people.

1766
01:38:42,983 --> 01:38:44,610
There We go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1767
01:38:44,685 --> 01:38:46,118
Good. Who Wants to go on a ride-along?

1768
01:38:46,186 --> 01:38:47,653
I do!

1769
01:38:48,155 --> 01:38:49,520
All right, you, sweetie.
Come on, let"s go. Move.

1770
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:50,817
-Move! Let"s go.
-Come on!

1771
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:04,235
Cool, a helicopter!
Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1772
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,875
Jesus!

1773
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:18,514
-Who are those guys?
-They"re Chechen investors.

1774
01:39:18,585 --> 01:39:21,645
We Were gonna do a Chechen version
of Dora the Explorer.

1775
01:39:21,722 --> 01:39:23,314
Anyway, it Went terribly Wrong.

1776
01:39:26,493 --> 01:39:28,688
I feel like it"s not fair
that they have a helicopter!

1777
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:30,755
Oh, no.

1778
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:33,224
Damn it.

1779
01:39:37,104 --> 01:39:39,572
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1780
01:39:39,673 --> 01:39:41,106
VO5 Hot Oil.

1781
01:39:44,445 --> 01:39:46,743
You"re gonna Wreck!
There"s cars coming from both directions!

1782
01:39:46,847 --> 01:39:47,939
I"m not gonna Wreck!

1783
01:39:49,917 --> 01:39:51,680
-l"m gonna Wreck! You"re right!
-You Want me to drive?

1784
01:40:11,705 --> 01:40:14,367
-This Was a very clever idea.
-Yeah.

1785
01:40:26,453 --> 01:40:27,750
They"re gone.

1786
01:40:29,156 --> 01:40:30,248
Let"s go.

1787
01:40:42,569 --> 01:40:46,005
They are Nigerians.
Yeah, l"d forgotten about them.

1788
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,109
-This is a shortcut.
-Are you kidding me?

1789
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:56,410
You cannot go down there.

1790
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:05,814
What are you doing?

1791
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:13,124
Hit him!

1792
01:41:20,841 --> 01:41:22,206
-Where are We?
-Chelsea Pier.

1793
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:29,774
What the hell?

1794
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:32,176
Jesus!

1795
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:41,391
Them having a helicopter
is definitely cheating.

1796
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:43,220
Go!

1797
01:41:48,368 --> 01:41:49,460
Come on!

1798
01:41:51,338 --> 01:41:52,896
We"re cops! Hit the chopper!

1799
01:42:15,829 --> 01:42:18,696
This is Martin and Fosse, en route.
Back off! This is our collar!

1800
01:42:20,534 --> 01:42:23,196
Set up a perimeter.
No arrests until We get there!

1801
01:42:23,504 --> 01:42:24,562
Take the light!

1802
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:46,282
Do not authorize that transfer.

1803
01:42:46,393 --> 01:42:47,951
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1804
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:50,461
He Will tell you not to authorize it, okay?
Tell him.

1805
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:53,192
-Tell him!
-Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1806
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:54,234
Approve it.

1807
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:56,894
NoW.

1808
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:58,562
Do not touch anything!

1809
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:01,236
I swear to God
l"ll blow your head all over this desk.

1810
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:03,742
Not a person in this room believes
you"ll shoot this clerk.

1811
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:04,902
Yeah?

1812
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,772
Thank you so much, gentlemen,
for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1813
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:13,284
I have two competing bids
from!jilted investors.

1814
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:16,217
They"re at 30 million, and holding.

1815
01:43:16,924 --> 01:43:18,892
-Wait! Can"t you let me...
-Take him away.

1816
01:43:19,459 --> 01:43:20,983
But computers.

1817
01:43:23,163 --> 01:43:26,564
What if, one day, they Were in charge?

1818
01:43:28,135 --> 01:43:32,231
NoW if you don"t shut up,
I Will cut your ear off With a butter knife.

1819
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:34,399
That"s blunt. Blunt"s Worse than if it"s sharp.

1820
01:43:34,474 --> 01:43:35,736
NoW!

1821
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:43,943
You!just stood there!

1822
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:46,815
I didn'"t know that ""noW"" meant that.
How am I supposed to know that?

1823
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,785
-I knew What that meant.
-Shut up.

1824
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,915
You kill us and you kill Ershon.
You"re out 30 million dollars.

1825
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:54,085
-Who"s got the golden goose noW, huh?
-Yeah.

1826
01:43:58,131 --> 01:43:59,723
Shit!

1827
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,561
He"s still valuable With a bullet Wound, mate.

1828
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:04,501
He immediately called your bluff.

1829
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:06,436
Get up. And kill the police.

1830
01:44:06,506 --> 01:44:07,973
I!just Wanna make sure I get it right.

1831
01:44:08,075 --> 01:44:11,476
Did you Want this transfer approved
or not approved?

1832
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:14,311
You, mate, l"m gonna kill!just for fun.

1833
01:44:15,849 --> 01:44:18,647
Police, don"t move! Drop your Weapons!

1834
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:21,687
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!

1835
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:24,690
I hope you like the taste
of prison food and penis.

1836
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:27,555
-Police! Down on the ground!
-Let me see your hands!

1837
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:37,735
-Hey, hey, you okay?
-Hey.

1838
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,005
Hey, Gene. Captain. I"m sorry.

1839
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:43,003
-l"m sorry.
-That"s okay. Don"t Worry about it.

1840
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:44,475
You can call me Gene
When We"re not in the office.

1841
01:44:45,045 --> 01:44:47,172
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1842
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:49,340
Attaboy.

1843
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:51,475
Come on, stay With me. Stay With me.

1844
01:44:51,718 --> 01:44:54,312
We"re losing him! We"re losing him!
He"s dying!

1845
01:44:55,055 --> 01:44:58,388
No. No, no, no, no. I"m!just resting.
I"m!just resting. I Was!just resting.

1846
01:44:58,492 --> 01:45:00,653
I"m sorry. Did I hurt you?

1847
01:45:00,727 --> 01:45:02,251
-Are you all right?
-Just resting.

1848
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:03,761
Hey, let me tell you something.

1849
01:45:03,864 --> 01:45:06,697
As far as paper-work goes,
We"ll take care of it.

1850
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:08,592
-You know Why?
-Why?

1851
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:10,192
Ain't"t too proud to beg.

1852
01:45:10,837 --> 01:45:12,031
Come on.

1853
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:13,936
-What?
-lt"s not funny anymore.

1854
01:45:14,041 --> 01:45:16,566
-I don"t know What you"re talking about.
-TLC references.

1855
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:18,668
Still nothing. I swear to you.

1856
01:45:19,012 --> 01:45:24,348
I"m gonna go over and check on Terry.
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.

1857
01:45:24,418 --> 01:45:27,216
It was the king of the mutt cases,

1858
01:45:27,287 --> 01:45:30,415
but Allen and Terry had worked it Like stars.

1859
01:45:33,293 --> 01:45:36,421
Within 24 hours of Learning
about Ershon's scheme

1860
01:45:36,530 --> 01:45:38,555
and LendL's massive Losses,

1861
01:45:38,632 --> 01:45:41,362
the government issued TARP funds
to bail out LendL.

1862
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:45,963
Lendl is in everything,
and We"re gonna go everywhere...

1863
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:47,404
They were too big to fail.

1864
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:53,139
Ershon now resides in Palomino
Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.

1865
01:45:53,246 --> 01:45:56,306
He still invests. Currency's just different.

1866
01:45:57,384 --> 01:45:59,784
Roger Wesley was Linked
to the Beaman murder

1867
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:03,686
by security cam footage
which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.

1868
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:05,588
It only showed the back of their heads.

1869
01:46:05,692 --> 01:46:09,788
But Allen's Faceback app
was able to get a match to their faces.

1870
01:46:10,263 --> 01:46:12,128
Terry married Francine.

1871
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:15,201
He played harp at the reception
and it was beautiful.

1872
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:16,792
He had Learned how to play it
in the eighth grade

1873
01:46:16,903 --> 01:46:20,270
to make fun of the fairy
that Lived up the street.

1874
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,866
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man,
but she declined.

1875
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:28,376
Let's be honest,
we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.

1876
01:46:28,448 --> 01:46:29,676
But guess what?

1877
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:33,242
The people that do the real work,
the ones that make the difference,

1878
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,512
you don't see them on TV
or on the front page.

1879
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:40,615
I'm talking about the day-in,
day-outers, the grinders.

1880
01:46:40,761 --> 01:46:43,889
Come on, man, you know who
I'm talking about: the other guys.

1881
01:46:43,964 --> 01:46:45,124
-See? That"s a no-go.
-Hey, hey.

1882
01:46:45,899 --> 01:46:47,890
You think you broke this Ershon case open?

1883
01:46:48,301 --> 01:46:49,529
You did nothing.

1884
01:46:49,936 --> 01:46:51,528
Corporate lobbyists are spending millions

1885
01:46:51,605 --> 01:46:53,869
to make sure guys like Ershon
keep doing What they do.

1886
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:55,730
Derek Jeter?

1887
01:46:57,144 --> 01:47:00,238
Yeah, it"s me. You Were set up
that night you shot me, Terry.

1888
01:47:00,547 --> 01:47:03,345
-I told you!
-They knew by putting someone like you

1889
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:06,386
With a quick trigger finger next to that door
Where I do my pre-game Walk,

1890
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:08,919
it"d end up bad. Bad for both of us.

1891
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,549
NoW, l"'ve been doing my own investigation
on the banking industry,

1892
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:13,750
and I Was close. I Was real close.

1893
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:15,321
So I forgive you, Terry.

1894
01:47:15,896 --> 01:47:17,989
I appreciate that, man. I"m sorry about
What happened.

1895
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:19,754
I"m glad you"re doing better.

1896
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:22,531
The Whole damn system is clogged up
With dirty money.

1897
01:47:23,136 --> 01:47:26,367
And the news doesn't"t say a Word about it.
"Cause Who owns them?

1898
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:28,974
The same corporations
that own the government.

1899
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:31,271
Courts and the law is all We have left.

1900
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:34,045
So here"s you guys" next case.

1901
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:38,083
Guy by the name of Carl Bachand,
CEO of Killister Bank.

1902
01:47:38,718 --> 01:47:42,552
He took three billion in TARP funds.
He"s crooked. He"s real crooked.

1903
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:47,685
Take him down, but be careful.
He"s got BlackWater mercenaries 24/7.

1904
01:47:48,728 --> 01:47:49,888
Thanks, Derek.

1905
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:53,325
Hey, Derek! Wait!
What if We need to get in touch With you,

1906
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:55,766
get some more information
or some tickets or something?

1907
01:47:56,503 --> 01:47:57,663
What!just happened?

1908
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:03,601
Goldman Sachs.
This case is gonna be nasty.

1909
01:48:06,279 --> 01:48:07,974
Hi. Cute glasses.

1910
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:10,950
-What Was that?
-What?

1911
01:48:11,017 --> 01:48:14,646
What? Dude, What is it With you
and hot ladies? What"s your secret?

1912
01:48:14,721 --> 01:48:17,383
Honestly, I have no idea
What you"re talking about.

1913
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:19,516
Tell me Who you lost your virginity to.

1914
01:48:19,626 --> 01:48:22,652
She actually became a TV actress.
Heather Locklear.

1915
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:24,390
Heather Locklear, What?

1916
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,125
-You"'ve heard of her?
-Come on!

1917
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:29,999
-She Was much chubbier back then.
-I don"t get it. I really, I don"t get it.

1918
01:53:30,904 --> 01:53:32,565
That Was you.
You don"t have a sense of humor.

1919
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:34,139
I do... I have a Wonderful sense of humor.

1920
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:36,199
If you say something funny, l"ll laugh.

1921
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:38,972
-All right, l"m gonna tell you a great!joke.
-Please. I love!jokes.

1922
01:53:39,112 --> 01:53:41,672
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

1923
01:53:43,082 --> 01:53:46,210
-lt"s time to get laid.
-Already feels inappropriate.

1924
01:53:46,519 --> 01:53:48,282
So he goes to the lady at the Whorehouse,
he goes, ""Miss,

1925
01:53:48,655 --> 01:53:51,818
""look, I know usually you Want money, but
I don"t have any money and it"s my birthday.

1926
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:53,921
""Do you think I could have sex With you
for this duck?""

1927
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:56,655
-Was he a farmer?
-No.

1928
01:53:56,863 --> 01:54:01,163
That"s probably a Health Code violation,
bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.

1929
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:03,159
They Weren"t gonna have sex With the duck!

1930
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:05,199
No, l!just mean Health Code violation

1931
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:08,866
to have the duck brought into
a facility like that.

1932
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:12,537
So, anyway, she says, ""Yes, l"ll do it.""

1933
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:15,513
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

1934
01:54:16,082 --> 01:54:19,245
-He gives her What?
-The high, hard one! She loves it.

1935
01:54:19,519 --> 01:54:22,511
She goes, ""You know What? If you do that
again, l"ll give you your duck back.""

1936
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:24,790
-lt"s like getting laid twice for free.
-So... I"m sorry.

1937
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:25,984
I"m so sorry.

1938
01:54:26,292 --> 01:54:30,228
-The duck is payment for sexual intercourse.
-Yes. Yes.

1939
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,556
-Very good.
-He used the duck as payment,

1940
01:54:31,631 --> 01:54:33,223
and noW he"s being paid back the duck.

1941
01:54:33,666 --> 01:54:36,760
He goes, ""Oh, my God, this is
the greatest birthday ever."" He does it again.

1942
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:40,631
-NoW he"s Walking home, right? Walking...
-So she Was satisfied With duck.

1943
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,931
-With a duck as currency...
-Yes.

1944
01:54:43,009 --> 01:54:45,477
...to her. Great. Good.

1945
01:54:45,812 --> 01:54:49,543
So he"s Walking home, noW he can"t Wait
to get home to tell his father. Right?

1946
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:52,077
He"s Walking down the street With the duck,
and all of a sudden, voom,

1947
01:54:52,151 --> 01:54:53,550
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

1948
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:55,052
-Kills the duck?
-Killed the duck.

1949
01:54:55,121 --> 01:54:57,282
-So the duck is noW dead.
-The duck is dead.

1950
01:54:57,757 --> 01:55:01,056
The kid starts crying, truck driver stops,
he"s all upset, he didn'"t mean...

1951
01:55:01,227 --> 01:55:04,355
Of course he"s crying! He"s a 13-year-old boy
Who"s!just had sex, twice,

1952
01:55:04,530 --> 01:55:07,988
-and he Watched his beloved duck die.
-Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

1953
01:55:08,167 --> 01:55:10,067
So far, I don"t know
how this is ever gonna be funny.

1954
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:12,838
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck,
he gives him two dollars.

1955
01:55:13,206 --> 01:55:14,537
And the kid"s happy With the two bucks?

1956
01:55:15,041 --> 01:55:18,499
He"s ecstatic! He got laid twice,
and noW he"s got two dollars on top of it.

1957
01:55:18,578 --> 01:55:21,046
Seems like a duck Would be Worth
a lot more than two dollars.

1958
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:23,739
This Was a While back. You What l"m...

1959
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:26,641
So he goes home, his dad goes,
""What happened? What happened?

1960
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:30,177
""Tell me! Tell me!"" He goes,
""Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,

1961
01:55:30,323 --> 01:55:31,847
""l got a duck for the fuck,

1962
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:33,688
""and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!""

1963
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:37,991
So it"s like a limerick.

1964
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:40,426
You didn'"t think that Was funny?

1965
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,765
I thought it Was entertaining
at the end, sure,

1966
01:55:43,469 --> 01:55:45,232
the Way all the Words Were put together,

1967
01:55:45,305 --> 01:55:46,863
but in terms of content?

1968
01:55:48,508 --> 01:55:49,600
No.

1969
01:55:52,812 --> 01:55:56,441
Get the check-check from Shen-Shen.
Let"s get out of here.

1970
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:05,852
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1971
01:56:06,326 --> 01:56:07,350
And cut.

1972
01:56:08,305 --> 01:57:08,581
