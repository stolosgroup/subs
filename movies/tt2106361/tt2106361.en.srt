00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,888
<i>Hey, pass the bottle over.</i>

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,522
<i>- A little busy back here. Okay?
- Yeah, we can see that, David.</i>

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,205
<i>Yeah, you can get un-busy.</i>

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,569
<i>Oh, come on, Marce. I mean,
you know, we skipped graduation for this.</i>

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,922
<i>You are not graduating down there,
David Brody.</i>

7
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,730
<i>Hey, you better not be filming us.</i>

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,325
<i>No, just checking messages.</i>

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,563
<i>Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head</i>

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,649
What was that?

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,763
- Do you see that?
- What?

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,645
Man. You guys seeing this?

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,603
- Whoa. Hey, Billy.
- Whoa. Ho-ho-ho.

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,330
Hang on.

15
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,481
- We should go.
- I gotta get this. Hang on.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,043
- Can we go?
- Come on, let's go.

17
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,725
- Yeah. Hold on.
- Get in!

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,690
I will! Just give me one minute!

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,968
- Come on!
- Are you seeing this?

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,610
- Whoa!
- Billy, get in!

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,609
Oh, shit! Tornado!

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,689
Oh, my God!

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,001
Get us out of here. Go!

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,971
<i>The tornado
that struck Oklahoma last night...</i>

25
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,043
<i>...took the lives
of four high school students...</i>

26
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,044
<i>...when it picked up their car
and tossed it into the air.</i>

27
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,006
<i>Tornadoes in this region of the Midwest
are common, but it only took a glance...</i>

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,611
<i>...to know this was different.</i>

29
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,286
<i>Not so much a twisting column
but a behemoth.</i>

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,761
Great. We missed another one.

31
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,322
Hey, you guys know
the goal of a documentary...

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,369
...is to actually document
something, right?

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,885
Copy <i>that.</i>

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,281
We need a tornado.

35
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,731
That's it. We need a tornado. Yeah.
When was the last time we shot one, Lucas?

36
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,680
That EF4 that we shot a year ago.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,969
Right. A year ago. So we're 0 for 365.

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,090
Let's figure that average.
Hey, Jacob, you play baseball. Right?

39
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,528
- Hockey, actually.
- Yeah? I played lacrosse.

40
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,366
- Really? No way.
- This is fun. It's like a family road trip.

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,922
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah, Jacob.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,969
You missed everything.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,369
No. Except we do have 200 hours
of cloud sunsets...

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,081
...and us going to every drive-through
from Idaho to Texas.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,126
Which makes this the most expensive
home movie ever.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,889
Just to be clear...

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,090
...we're gonna get paid
whether we see a tornado or not, right?

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,721
Right?

49
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,448
<i>Where do you wanna go, boss?</i>

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,930
I have no idea, Daryl.
My job is to shoot them...

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,281
...not find <i>them.</i>

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,608
- He's upset.
- What else is new?

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,491
Three months of that broken record.
I'm over it.

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,768
Just be thankful we're in here
and not in the <i>Titus.</i>

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,964
- Must be brutal in there.
- You left <i>the</i> radio on, genius.

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,003
Shit.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,484
That probably didn't help his mood.

58
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,722
Screw his mood.
We've got other problems.

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,326
There's no way we could have known
that tornado was gonna hit.

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,007
The National Weather
Service has issued a <i>tornado watch...</i>

61
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,925
<i>...throughout Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri.</i>

62
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,243
Pete. National Weather posted
a tornado watch across five states.

63
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,925
Front's growing and moving fast.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,163
I think this thing's gonna hit
about 200 miles north of here.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,526
<i>Then we better haul ass.</i>

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,844
<i>If you're in the path of this storm,
you could be in for</i> a <i>very long day.</i>

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,530
Hey. So today is June 16th...

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,004
...and this is my time capsule message
to the future me.

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,649
Um... This is gonna be recorded
and stored for 25 years...

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,691
...when you, the 41-year-old
Donnie Fuller, will...

71
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,920
...I don't know,
see how life's panned out, I guess.

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,206
Uh...

73
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,007
By now Dad is 65.

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,889
So Mom would have been...

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,802
Mom would have been 63.

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,450
Um...

77
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,886
What else?
You're a junior at Silverton High School.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,011
You're head of the Video Club,
which is awesome.

79
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,045
And...

80
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,886
And that's pretty much it.

81
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,247
So this is Casa de Donnie...

82
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,731
Where you spend most your time...

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,566
...staring at the photo
of Kaitlyn Johnston and doing nothing.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,566
This is Trey, your annoying
brother. - Respect to you too.

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,371
By the time you see this,
Trey's gonna be in the state pen.

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,526
Heh. No way. I will be playing lead guitar
to 100,000 fans in Madison Square Garden.

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,844
But you will be stuck right here,
moaning over her.

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,890
This is Dad. He's the vice
principal at Silverton High School...

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,771
...which is not the greatest for me.

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,127
- Uh, Dad?
- Hmm?

91
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,250
Hey, come on. I'm having breakfast here.

92
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,170
- Trey, I am leaving in five, ready or not.
- Relax!

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,362
Wanna say something
to the future you, Dad?

94
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,808
Not now, Donnie, okay?
Busy day. Can't you see that?

95
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,166
Dad, you're the one...

96
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,971
...that wanted these video-time-capsule
pieces in the first place.

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,448
This weather's gonna kill the graduation
ceremony.

98
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,965
We should postpone it.

99
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,408
Okay. This is time-capsule interview,
version number two.

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,362
What kind of man am I?
That's a hard question to answer.

101
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,807
I mean, how do you describe perfection?

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,883
I thought you did your interview already.

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,121
I did. Yesterday.

104
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,124
But then I remembered I look way better
in the morning light.

105
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,126
Lift with your legs, Dad.

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,930
Come on, guys, I could use some help.

107
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,404
Ah, man, I can't.
That old soccer-injury thing with my back.

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,324
- Yeah? You get all that?
- I did.

109
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,641
Good. Get in.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,881
Shotgun!

111
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,363
- Donnie, let's go.
- I'm taking my bike.

112
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,490
Dude. Chill. If you
want shotgun, just take it.

113
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,281
Hey, I'm sorry. With the storm and
graduation today, I got a lot on my plate.

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,365
- I know. It's always something. I'm used to it.
- What does that mean?

115
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,841
It means you're either ignoring me
or on my case.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
- That's not true.
- If it's not my room, it's my grades.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,483
Or it's this time capsule,
which I'm working my ass off to get done.

118
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,401
No. What's the point?
Nothing's ever good enough for you.

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,125
Stop for second. Let's talk.

120
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,044
No. Busy day, Dad. Can't you see that?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,525
All right, Dad. Dad.

122
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,765
Right at this moment... Don't even think about
it before you answer. Just blurt it out.

123
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,160
...Who is your favorite son?

124
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,646
Get in the car.

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,526
Well.

126
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,682
I know we missed it last night.
We couldn't get there in time.

127
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,650
Yeah. I know. I know.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,763
Well, if you pull my
funding, that's it for me.

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,008
And we're onto a big one.

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,204
I don't know how big. It's a tornado.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
They don't call to tell me
how big they're gonna be.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,446
There's a massive storm front moving
through the area.

133
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,371
We're gonna get it.
We just don't have it yet.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,689
Uh, well, she was your idea.

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,202
I wanted David Sinclair, remember?

136
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,569
Yeah. Well, I was getting a lot closer
without Allison and her data.

137
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,651
It's an instinct game.

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,609
And she ain't got it.

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,408
Hey, Jacob. A little help?

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,609
- I can't. If I stop filming,
Pete's gonna fire me. DARYL: Dude.

141
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,444
Don't you dare let him bully you.

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,570
Easy for you to say.
You're not the one sitting next to him.

143
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,846
You having fun yet?

144
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,646
Oh, yeah, dude.
This is so much better than Cancún.

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,928
I'm telling you,
last year we got within 100 yards.

146
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,163
It's like nothing you've seen before.
Trust me.

147
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,482
Okay, so larger system is moving
toward Riverside as predicted.

148
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,886
I think we should go here.

149
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,086
The wind and precipitation readings in the
trailing cell look better for a funnel.

150
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,641
Exactly what you said
about Morristown and Osgood.

151
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,327
This one's different. It's not following
the pattern. It's growing faster.

152
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,527
It's growing faster.

153
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,889
Every storm chaser
this side of Hawaii is going to Riverside.

154
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,771
Which, by the way,
is where I think we should go.

155
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,928
But you want us to go where? Silverton?

156
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,841
If you would like, consider this
an instinct thing instead of a data thing.

157
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,726
If you heard that,
then you also heard that Steve cut us off.

158
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,002
- And it's on my dime now.
- I heard that.

159
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,288
This is months on the road.
And guess what.

160
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,603
We got nothing you can't get on YouTube.
Worst season I've ever had.

161
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,201
You think this is instinct.
I think it's data.

162
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,330
The fact is, it's neither
without a big fat dose of luck.

163
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,724
And there is nothing I can do about that.
Okay?

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,486
So back off of me.

165
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,371
I just want you and your data
to find me a goddamn tornado.

166
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,887
Then Silverton's our best chance.

167
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,967
What do you think?

168
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,249
She's the one with all the degrees.

169
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,846
My money's on her.

170
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,210
Silverton it is.

171
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,530
You better be right about this.

172
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,047
- It's your last chance.
- Wow.

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,727
Yeah, okay. Hang on. Okay. It's okay.

174
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,325
All right. We recording?

175
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,561
- We're good?
- You ready?

176
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,840
- Hell, yeah, man!
- Yeah! Get fired up!

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,440
- I'm ready!
- You ready for this shit?

178
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,040
Maybe we should get some girls
to watch this stunt, huh?

179
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,881
That's what I'm talking about. Get
fired up! Let's go for real! It's go time!

180
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,008
- Let's go, let's go!
- Safety first.

181
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,970
Okay, just do a test run first, all right?
Move, jackass!

182
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,482
- Get out of the way. Here we go.
- Come on. Yeah. You got it, buddy.

183
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,640
- Come on, buddy!
- Come on, Donk! Let's go, boy!

184
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,683
He's gonna check the speed on this one.

185
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,851
Yeah! Do it, bro!

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,764
- Let's go!
- Test drive!

187
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,490
Let's go for the test drive!

188
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,125
There you go, Donkie!

189
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,886
Well, that looked pretty good to me.
What do you think?

190
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,166
Eh.

191
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,482
What? You wanna
nail some tail or what, dog?

192
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,689
- I'm always up for nailing tail!
- That's what I'm talking about.

193
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,605
Once this hits the Internet, you'll
be beating them off with a stick.

194
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,889
- Fours? Fives? All kinds?
- I'm talking fives, sixes.

195
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,451
Fives, for sure. Come on!

196
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
- Barn!
- Trust me, buddy!

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,889
Yeah! All right! Hang on.

198
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,765
- Richie! Record this, son.
- Are you drunk?

199
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,800
- Yeah.
- I'm just getting started.

200
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,247
Hang on! Wait!
We're gonna light the pool on fire.

201
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,520
- Light that thing, Richie!
- Yeah! Light it up!

202
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,886
Light that puppy up.

203
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,087
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

204
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,322
The Flaming Pool of Death!

205
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,847
You ready to go?

206
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,367
Let's do this!

207
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,601
Action!

208
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,762
That's right! Come on, Donk!
You got this!

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,206
Oopsie daisy!

210
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,649
- That was awesome. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

211
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,406
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That was awesome, Donk.

212
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,325
- A million hits, easy!
- Oh! A million?

213
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,042
- Maybe more!
- Hell, yeah, dude! We're gonna be famous!

214
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,842
- Shit, my pool!
- Dude, your mom. Your mom.

215
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,567
What the hell are you two idiots doing?

216
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,405
- I thought you were at work!
- That makes any difference?

217
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,607
Look!

218
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,804
- That's the Titus! I've seen it on TV! Come on!
- Bye, Ma!

219
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,723
Let's take a tour of the ultimate
storm-chasing vehicle, the Titus.

220
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,363
She's equipped with 24 surveillance
cameras, so we have eyes from every angle.

221
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,602
Bulletproof Lexan windows.

222
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,441
A gyroscopic stabilized camera.

223
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,807
A five-ton winch.

224
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,561
Four-millimeter solid steel armor.

225
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,281
Now, back here, we have
a mini weather center, complete with...

226
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,206
...an anemometer, humidity sensor
and potentiometer.

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,528
But the thing that makes her really special
are these grappling claws.

228
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,923
Ah.

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,721
They can stabilize us in winds
up to 170 miles an hour.

230
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,089
We're not going anywhere
with those suckers dug in.

231
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,970
Clear!

232
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,731
This is the culmination of my life's work.

233
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,290
What about the turret, Pete?

234
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,205
Right. The turret is up here.

235
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,881
Which gives us a 360-degree view
of outside.

236
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,124
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that
will, when we find one of these bad boys...

237
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,203
...give us the shot of the century.

238
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,051
A sight nobody but God has witnessed:

239
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,251
the eye of the tornado.

240
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,201
That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.

241
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,725
Let's get some B roll.

242
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,408
Get shots of the claws, the instruments
on the back, panel stuff.

243
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,688
- Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?
- Got it.

244
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,689
My storm's expanding.

245
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,126
That means it's going to be really big
by the time it gets here.

246
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,004
<i>Hey-</i>

247
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,043
How's my bug?

248
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,842
Well, listen, um...

249
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,044
I know I was gonna try
and make it home this weekend...

250
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,602
...but we got a real big storm coming,
and Mama's gotta work.

251
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,604
No. No. I'm gonna need you to tell Grandma
and Grandpa that we're...

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,804
I know.

253
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,440
I know, sweet girl. I'm sorry.

254
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,970
I'm really sorry.

255
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,360
Gracie...

256
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,241
Grace...

257
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,282
Hey, hey-

258
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,201
Did you get all that?

259
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,686
We can't postpone this, Gary. There's
not enough room inside for everyone.

260
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,162
- The weather's gonna be fine.
- It's your call.

261
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,210
There's Dad taking shit
from Principal Walker.

262
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,640
I Will do that.

263
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,043
Did you get the last of the interviews?

264
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,287
I still got a few to do.

265
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,809
But what I did get was a nice shot
of Miss Bell's cleavage. Wanna see?

266
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,007
Trey.

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,124
What? You don't get many teachers
with a rack like that.

268
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,090
Cut it out. We need to start editing
right after graduation.

269
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,561
Dad wants the clips online
by the end of next week.

270
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,041
What's the point of doing
a video time capsule?

271
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,567
Video won't even exist in 25 years.

272
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,445
What? Let's just get it finished. Okay?

273
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,681
Fine.

274
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,323
Did you see the weather report?
Supposed to be a big storm coming.

275
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,005
Maybe they'll cancel the whole...

276
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,764
Whoa. There's your girl.

277
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,163
If I don't get it by the end of the day,
you'll not get the internship.

278
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,560
It's as simple as that.

279
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,770
Oh, dude. Now's your chance, man.
Vulnerable girl.

280
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,924
Comforting guy. Right?
Just go talk to her and see if she's okay.

281
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,401
- We have work to do.
- Chickenshit. Come on.

282
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,246
I need to get the last of the interviews,
and Dad's, like, on my case about it.

283
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,405
Screw Dad.
Go do something for yourself for once.

284
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,565
Bro, I am literally begging you.
Just go talk to her.

285
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,081
All right?

286
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,441
All right.

287
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,931
Yeah?

288
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,686
- Stop.
- Heh.

289
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,524
Have fun.

290
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,044
He's really doing it.
I gotta film this train wreck.

291
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,041
And he's pulling into the station.

292
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,850
Hey, Kaitlyn?

293
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,931
<i>Hey-</i>

294
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,445
It's Donnie.

295
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,045
Yeah. I know.

296
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,004
Strike one.

297
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,727
Are you okay?
I saw you outside with Miss Blasky.

298
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,928
Right. Uh...

299
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,968
I had this application for an apprenticeship,
and it had to be submitted by the weekend.

300
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,569
And Miss Blasky checked it for me,
and it's just completely corrupted.

301
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,961
I don't know what happened to it.

302
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,482
It was fine yesterday.

303
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,126
Yeah. Yeah, that's toast.
What was it about?

304
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,930
The abandoned factory on Garner.

305
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,764
- Oh, the paper mill?
- Yeah.

306
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,081
Yeah.

307
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,528
When they shut it down, the state
never paid for an official cleanup.

308
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,048
So there's all these chemicals
and hazardous materials sitting there...

309
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,523
...contaminating the soil
and probably running off into the water.

310
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,810
- That's what the film's about.
- Pretend to be interested.

311
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,601
Anyway, the submission doesn't make
any sense at all without it.

312
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,081
- So I'm screwed.
- Come on, man. Take a swing.

313
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,001
- You're into all this environmental stuff,
huh? Come on, man. Just ask her out.

314
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,330
Gotta take care of the planet, right?

315
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,245
Or else the planet
will take care of us, right? Heh.

316
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,731
That was awkward.

317
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,487
Heh. Yeah. Well, some of us care,
or at least are trying to.

318
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,808
No. I'm sorry.

319
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,521
I can help. I have all these cameras
and this editing software and...

320
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,170
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,085
Well, this will be easy.
We can reshoot this.

322
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,244
- It'd have to be today.
- Today?

323
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,521
Oh, you're filming the graduation.
No, it's fine.

324
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,604
No. No. My brother, Trey,
he's good with all this stuff too.

325
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,245
- He can get that.
- No way.

326
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,368
- Like, he can get that footage.
- Really?

327
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,806
- It's not a problem.
- Sure?

328
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,367
- Yes, it's a problem.
- I'm sure. Yeah.

329
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,361
Thank you so much.

330
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,321
No. You have no idea what this means
for me. I owe you so big for this.

331
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,086
No. Well, you know,
me and the planet go way back, so...

332
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,326
Thank you.

333
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,683
<i>- I'll</i> see you later.
- Cool.

334
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,205
- Thank you.
- Okay, no.

335
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,328
This is so not cool.

336
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,409
You are kidding me.

337
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,530
What are you doing?

338
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,807
What are you doing?

339
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,530
You're gonna skip the ceremony?

340
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,284
Yeah. Yeah.

341
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,967
You said do something for yourself,
so I'm doing something for myself.

342
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,640
Yeah. And leaving me to do all the filming?

343
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,208
You can handle it. Right?

344
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,282
You can handle it, right?

345
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,125
- Yes.
- Heh.

346
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,363
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.
Hey. You go for it, bro.

347
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,171
But get some skin on camera.
E-mail it to me.

348
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,490
- Just get the interviews, all right?
- All right, all right, I'm going.

349
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,727
Okay.

350
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,481
Yo, Todd. We're rolling.

351
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,410
Yo, what's up, me?
How's life in the future, bro?

352
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,407
So I just know by now you are playing
for the NBA, you're super loaded...

353
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,326
...and you got a super-smoking-hot
cheerleader wife.

354
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,687
So why the hell are you watching this
right now?

355
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,724
Why don't you get up to your penthouse
and bang her good, right?

356
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,641
That's your time-capsule message, Todd?

357
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,881
Why not?

358
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,690
A message?

359
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,568
Too late for me. Too late for these guys.
But my kids? Grandkids? Simple.

360
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,250
Study. Get good grades.

361
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,325
Or else you're gonna hang around this group
of losers shoveling shit all day. Sorry.

362
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,609
Please marry a rich guy.
Please marry a rich guy.

363
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,762
Uh, we're rolling.

364
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,484
So, what would you like to say
to yourself in 25 years?

365
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,441
That was it.

366
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,050
Twenty-five years' time? Ha! My guess is
we'd have blown up the world by that time.

367
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,287
All right.

368
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,568
High school sucked.

369
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,883
Hopefully, it was all worth it.
You've got your Ph.D. from Brown.

370
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,731
You're doing research
and using your skills to help...

371
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,410
Douche-rocket! Ha!

372
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,845
Sorry, man.

373
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,360
- Radio check.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,084
Copy <i>that.</i>

375
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,571
Camera's good.

376
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,010
Hey, guys. So you think we'll get to see
a tornado today or what?

377
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,446
You never know.

378
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,247
Jacob, did you bring
all the camera batteries? I only saw four.

379
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,281
I, uh, left them back
at the hotel on charge.

380
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,529
Today is not a good day to run out
of power. We gotta go get them.

381
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,200
Let's get moving. This system's
supposed to hit within the hour.

382
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,646
If that.

383
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,122
Come on, dude, get your shit together, man.
You're making me look bad.

384
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,290
Mike check. One, two, three.

385
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
- Where's Donnie?
- Mike check.

386
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,691
- Yeah, it's good.
- I don't know. Around.

387
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,647
- He knows what time we're starting?
- Yeah, sure.

388
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,649
Anyway, I can run the cameras.

389
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,205
All three?

390
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,449
Well, yes, Dad.
That's why they invented tripods.

391
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,846
Trey, this is important.

392
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,884
And I can't do it, right?

393
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,168
I didn't say that.

394
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,449
You kind of did.

395
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,165
Hey, Mom. How's Gracie? She still mad?

396
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,527
<i>She's 5 years old. She'll be fine.</i>

397
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,366
I know, but I've been gone for months.
That's too long to be away from her.

398
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,442
I keep thinking it was
a mistake coming here.

399
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,125
<i>Allison, we're fine.</i>

400
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,927
<i>This is your job.
What you're doing is important.</i>

401
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,128
I can't stop thinking
about those kids that died.

402
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,520
What <i>kids?</i>

403
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,724
Nothing, sweetie. Grandma
and Mama were just talking. But listen.

404
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,407
I am sorry about our call earlier, okay?
I don't want you mad at me.

405
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,250
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

406
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,562
Real soon. The season's almost over.

407
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,449
<i>Why can't you just come now?</i>

408
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,285
I wish I could. I really do. I miss you.

409
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,760
Allison!

410
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,768
Listen, I gotta go. But I'm gonna check in
every couple hours, okay?

411
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,809
<i>Promise me you'll be home soon?</i>

412
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,047
I promise.

413
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,730
Allison!

414
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,491
I gotta go. I love you, bug.

415
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,244
<i>I love you too.</i>

416
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,447
I'm coming, boss!

417
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,251
<i>We have now confirmed
that a tornado has hit Riverside.</i>

418
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,927
<i>All of Shaw County remains
under a severe thunderstorm warning.</i>

419
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,605
<i>Chuck, what do you see on radar?</i>

420
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,167
<i>What we're watching now
is this very</i> rapid...

421
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,765
- Data, huh?
- Shit.

422
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,241
Maybe we'll catch the tail end of it.

423
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,525
- What's going on in Silverton?
- Give me a minute.

424
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,449
Um, it's dissipating. There's some scattered
thunderstorms and that's about it.

425
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,285
Thunderstorms? Thunderstorms.

426
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,322
Put everything in the van.
We're moving now.

427
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,801
- Where do you wanna go?
- Uh...

428
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,770
You're not going anywhere.
We are going to Riverside.

429
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,800
- How about...?
- We'll catch the next one.

430
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,481
Look. There's not gonna be a next one.

431
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,130
Let's go.

432
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,365
Look at the size of them!

433
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,841
- I thought you said it was dissipating.
- It was.

434
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,128
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna check the Doppler!

435
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,850
Right behind you, Allison.

436
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,371
Whoa, wait! Wait up!

437
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,488
Oh, you see these, Allison? These are huge!

438
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,801
Yeah!

439
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,325
Ow! Son of a bitch!

440
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,406
Oh, my God! Look at these, guys!
They're bigger than golf balls!

441
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,640
Ah! Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

442
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,842
- What do we got?
- It's regenerating.

443
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,047
And?

444
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,685
Silverton.

445
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,921
It's coming.

446
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,246
Great.

447
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,524
Great.

448
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,001
To all the students
of this year's graduating class...

449
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,087
...who have dedicated themselves to the
hard work necessary to reach this day...

450
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,523
...you are now standing on the threshold
of adult life.

451
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,684
You are free to take your own path...

452
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,051
...and that path will be
different for all of you.

453
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,363
But it's now time to create your own lives.

454
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,205
To create your own destiny.

455
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,362
I mean, look at this place.

456
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,046
They should tear it down. Decontaminate it.

457
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,362
Plant some trees or a garden or something.

458
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,364
They should totally
build a skate park here.

459
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,564
No, a garden. Definitely a garden.

460
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,801
Yeah.

461
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,406
So you wanna just
put the tripod down over there?

462
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,291
- Wow.
- Hmm.

463
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,966
- Watch your step.
- Yeah.

464
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,286
I look okay?

465
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,489
Yeah. You look beautiful.

466
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,329
I wasn't saying... I was, like, for the...

467
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,928
I don't know. Uh, I'm rolling here.

468
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,005
- So whenever you're ready to...
- Thanks, Donnie. You're really sweet.

469
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,926
Right.

470
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,884
<i>Pete,</i> where are you?

471
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,724
I'm coming right up.

472
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,369
- Got wall cloud to the east.
- Whoa.

473
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,931
Yeah, but no vortex.

474
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,607
- Jacob. I got some circulation over here.
- Over here, got it.

475
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,410
It's heading towards those trees.

476
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,085
I'm on Oakwood Road.

477
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,130
<i>If you're in Shaw County, you need
to get yourself to a safe place now.</i>

478
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,011
<i>This thing is going to track right,
almost towards town.</i>

479
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,288
<i>There it is now.
You can see the wall cloud.</i>

480
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,522
<i>It's lower as it transitions to the east.</i>

481
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,721
- Just south. Right behind the base.
- Wow. Look at that.

482
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,325
Come on, baby.

483
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,642
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

484
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,402
What are those idiots doing?

485
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,090
- Aw, this is a beauty!
- Whoo!

486
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,527
Yeah! Twista Hunterz, baby!

487
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,409
Get in the field! Get in the field!

488
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,446
Look at that funnel.

489
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,491
We got a vortex. Come on.
Here we go, guys. Here we go.

490
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,810
There's debris.

491
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,644
- Jake, you getting this?
- Oh, yeah.

492
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,847
<i>There it is.</i>

493
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,850
<i>This tornado just touched down.
We can see it from here.</i>

494
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,805
<i>It's ripping up trees.
It's ripping up everything in sight.</i>

495
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,925
<i>If you're above ground, you need to get to
a storm shelter or a safe place right now.</i>

496
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,562
I leave you with John Updike's words:

497
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,482
"You cannot help but learn more
as you take the world into your hands.

498
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,806
Take it up reverently...

499
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,530
...for it is an old piece of clay,
with millions of thumbprints on it."

500
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,844
Oh, great.

501
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,684
I guess we should, uh...

502
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,081
I guess we should start finishing up, then.

503
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,528
Whoo! Look at the size of that sucker!

504
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,091
Look how fast it's spinning, man!

505
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,686
Shit! Man, that was close!

506
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,524
Dude. My arm hairs.

507
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,603
No. Dude, it's your "hairs" hairs!

508
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,809
- They're standing up on your head, bro!
- Ha-ha-ha.

509
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,210
Come on. Come on.

510
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,569
- That's the vorticity stretching.
- We're on, we're on. Let's move!

511
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,802
- I wanna report a tornado on the ground.
- Let's go.

512
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,406
There's no damage yet,
but it's in a semi-residential area.

513
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,531
About 15 miles to the north of Silverton,
Oklahoma.

514
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,324
Seniors! Stand up!

515
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,690
Stand up!

516
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,044
We salute you!

517
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,691
All right! Ah.

518
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,086
Go inside, guys.

519
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,847
- Stay calm! Move inside in an orderly
fashion! Everybody, back inside.

520
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,889
- To the main building.
- Dude, come on.

521
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,804
Quickly as you can.

522
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,887
Shit!

523
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,645
Here we go! Quickly! Come on!

524
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,763
Here we go! Come on, this way.

525
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,449
<i>Pete,</i> give <i>me</i> an update.

526
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,921
I'm gonna find the intercept
near Grant and Malcolm.

527
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,163
<i>- Approach it from the east.
Jake, you're out of focus. Tighten up.</i>

528
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,971
<i>You need to position yourself.
This thing is moving fast.</i>

529
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,645
I need a clear path.

530
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,770
I got a field coming up on your right
that should have access.

531
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,960
<i>Give me a second to
calculate rotation speed.</i>

532
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,844
Make it fast.

533
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,729
<i>- Wind speed is 140.
- Direction?</i>

534
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,927
Southeast.

535
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,607
- Lucas, we good?
- Yeah. We good. We good.

536
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,285
You getting this, Jacob?

537
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,646
Oh, yeah. Sure.

538
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,771
Okay. Ready for intercept.

539
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,126
Daryl, pull over.

540
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,281
- Get out there, dog! Get out there!
- Look at me!

541
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,886
- I'm in a tornado! I'm in a tornado!
- Whoo!

542
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,803
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

543
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,724
We're in the path! We're in the path!

544
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,968
Okay. Anchor down. How we looking?

545
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,245
- It's heading right for you.
- Get ready, guys.

546
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,482
Oh, shit.

547
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,283
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

548
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,887
Jacob! Don't you lose it on me, you hear?

549
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,281
Hold on, boys!

550
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,802
Shit! You guys, come on, now!

551
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,009
This is crazy, you guys. This is nuts.

552
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,442
Come on, come on! God!

553
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,600
Shit, that thing is crazy!

554
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,207
Hang on!

555
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,728
It's coming right! Go! Go on!

556
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,366
Damn it!

557
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,249
<i>It dodged to our left.</i>

558
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,441
Oh, shit.

559
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,085
It's headed for the school.

560
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,609
Everybody! Okay, go!

561
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,804
Here we go. Here we go. Keep moving.
All the way down the hall.

562
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,128
Keep this door open. Come on.

563
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,405
- Move on in, folks. Move in.
- Come on.

564
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,721
Jesus.

565
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,961
Everybody into the storm shelter area.

566
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,049
- Keep this hallway clear.
- Come on.

567
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
- Make sure nobody's behind us.
- All the way down!

568
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,166
Go on, all the way in.

569
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,084
Trey! Where's Donnie?

570
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,244
Uh, I don't exactly know.

571
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,081
Get away from the window.

572
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,126
Tornado!

573
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,850
Get going! Run!

574
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,447
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go!

575
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,127
It's okay!

576
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,760
All the way down the hall! Keep going!

577
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,844
All the way down! Keep moving.
Come on. Fast as you can!

578
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,927
Okay, get down!

579
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,606
Let's go. Come on.

580
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,923
Face the wall! Cover your heads!
Stay down!

581
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,361
Heads down, everybody!
Everyone stay down!

582
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,886
Get your heads down!

583
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,124
Get your head down.

584
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,644
Stay against the wall!

585
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,321
No, no! Oh, my God!

586
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,166
Trey!

587
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,681
Dad!

588
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,841
Anybody hurt?

589
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,684
We're all right.

590
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,851
- Trey?
- Yeah. I'm good.

591
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,167
You ready?

592
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,331
Oh, hey, can you hold this? You got it?

593
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,360
- My dad.
- Are you gonna answer it?

594
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,205
No. You kidding me?
I missed the whole grad ceremony. No.

595
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,044
Is he gonna be pissed at you?

596
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,248
Nah. You know what?
Trey will have filmed it.

597
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,289
Oh, come on, pick up.

598
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,687
- Trey, give me your phone.
- Yeah.

599
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,481
- Trey?
- Donnie, you okay?

600
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,047
Dad? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

601
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,247
<i>Where are you?</i>

602
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,041
Dad, Trey can handle all the filming
and stuff. It's not, like, a problem.

603
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,449
Never mind about that. Are you safe?
Tell me where you are.

604
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,046
<i>Safe? Yeah. I'm at the old paper mill.</i>

605
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,766
- On Garner?
- Yeah.

606
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,729
Listen, it's really important that you...

607
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,281
<i>- Dad? Dad?
- Donnie?</i>

608
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,090
- Dad?
- Stay <i>where</i> you are...

609
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,287
Donnie?

610
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
- Donnie!
- What happened?

611
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,963
It just cut out. Here.

612
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,520
Whoa.

613
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,847
- Maybe we should go.
- Heh. Yeah.

614
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,844
- What is that?
- I don't know.

615
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,444
- Come on!
- Aah!

616
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,810
It's all right. It's all right.

617
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,804
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get my son. He's out there.

618
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,360
Oh, my God.

619
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,971
From our vantage point...

620
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,088
<i>...the damage could have been
a whole lot worse.</i>

621
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,208
<i>The tornado just narrowly grazed
the school...</i>

622
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,765
Daryl, are you hearing this?

623
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,649
...as <i>you can see from this footage.</i>

624
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,486
<i>The National Weather Service is currently
tracking a second supercell...</i>

625
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,411
<i>...moving in our direction.
I know it's hard to imagine...</i>

626
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,562
A second cell.

627
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,485
- This is gonna be bad.
- How can there be another system?

628
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,286
I've never seen anything like this.
These updrafts are insane.

629
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,484
Got downed power lines.

630
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,280
- We're stuck.
- It's all right. I'm about to make his day.

631
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,489
<i>We're gonna send it
back to Don Lemon in the studio.</i>

632
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,483
Heads up, Lucas. Live wire.

633
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,121
What else we got?

634
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,521
Activity heading toward the center of town.

635
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,727
Second cell?

636
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,041
It's organized. The hook echo is huge.

637
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,090
I wanna set up
as close to the perimeter as possible.

638
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,480
I wanna be in the middle.

639
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,210
- I'm not gonna miss it.
- I hear you.

640
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,801
- Jake, how you doing?
<i>- Never better.</i>

641
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,361
You hang in there, honey.
That was nothing. Here you go.

642
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,841
Send that to my GPS. Let's roll. Come on.

643
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,809
You want a coffee with that, boss?

644
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,526
Kaitlyn?

645
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,680
Kaitlyn!

646
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,009
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah. My leg.

647
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,525
Okay. Your leg?

648
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,731
Here, let me see it.

649
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,689
It really hurts.

650
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,207
- Ugh.
- Hold on.

651
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,160
Okay. All right, hang on.

652
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,644
- Don't touch it.
- Ow.

653
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,402
I'm gonna tie this, okay?

654
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,404
- Be careful.
- Sorry.

655
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,086
- All right?
- Yeah.

656
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,568
What was Donnie doing there
in the first place?

657
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,564
He's with Kaitlyn.
He's been in love with her forever.

658
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,847
Johnston?

659
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,641
Yeah. He's shooting this video project
thing for her.

660
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,245
Why didn't he just tell me?

661
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,563
I don't know, Dad. You're
so easy to talk to.

662
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,085
I'm just saying.

663
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,684
Whoa.

664
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,008
Oh, my God.

665
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,006
Hey, boy.

666
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,406
<i>Hey-</i>

667
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,403
Dad, that's Chester's dog.

668
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,806
Chester?

669
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,047
Chester?

670
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,769
Chester!

671
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,683
Dad, be careful!

672
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,280
- You okay?
- Had to go looking for shelter.

673
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,447
Was gonna drive.

674
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,721
Let me see.

675
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,291
- You hurt?
- Get the door.

676
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,926
The belt's stuck.

677
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,127
I gotta cut him out.

678
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,209
Hey, can I get some help over here?

679
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,811
Here.

680
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,371
- I know, I'm not supposed to have that.
- We'll talk about that later. Hang on.

681
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,970
- Put this under him.
- Yep.

682
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,969
- Right there.
- Put him down.

683
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,840
- Can you get everybody to the high school?
- Uh-huh.

684
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,803
They've got a storm shelter.

685
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,321
- You wanna go with them?
- No way.

686
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,482
- Make sure he's okay.
- You got it.

687
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,488
Oh, shit.

688
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,125
Oh, come on.

689
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,685
Try your phone again.

690
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,521
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

691
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,727
- Anything?
- There's no signal.

692
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,370
Damn it.

693
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,170
There are those idiots.

694
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,846
Pull over.

695
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,365
Hey, Pete, you can pass us.

696
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,842
- Allison, we don't have <i>time</i> to waste.
- Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

697
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,367
Hello! Your main man Reevis here.

698
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,369
- I'm with my buddy Donk.
- Badonkadonk! Heh.

699
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,040
- What just happened?
- All right, so check this out.

700
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,409
I was in a tornado, right?
And let me tell you. One word:

701
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,325
- "it sucked." Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha.
That's two words, jackass.

702
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,723
I know. Two words, but I was, like,
getting sucked up in the thing.

703
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,723
It was smart back there with the knife.

704
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,723
Thanks. I thought you'd be mad.

705
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,446
Oh, I am. Hand it over.

706
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,162
We should turn left on Main.

707
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,366
I'm gonna take the highway.

708
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,171
Dad, if we out through Main,
we can take Rosewood all the way.

709
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,368
We save like 20 minutes.

710
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,247
All right.

711
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,926
Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, guys!

712
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,650
Gentlemen!

713
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,445
It's gonna be damn head. Ha-ha-ha.

714
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,687
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey.

715
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,649
- You two need to go inside and stay there.
- Whoa.

716
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,167
You guys actually get paid to do this shit?

717
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,004
I'm in the wrong damn job, man.

718
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,730
- You don't have a job.
- Heh.

719
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,166
Let's go, Allison!

720
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,887
Grab a brew.
It's like a zombie apocalypse out here.

721
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,362
- We're wasting time.
- I don't think we can leave them.

722
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,126
- Look. They're not our responsibility.
- They're drunk.

723
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,282
- Guys.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You getting this?

724
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,081
- Look, look. Donk, Donk.
- Oh. Hell, yeah! Ha, ha!

725
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,125
Hell, yeah.

726
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,850
Look at it.

727
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,441
- Whoa, shit! Where did it go?
- Where'd it go? What?

728
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,850
Where is it...?

729
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,765
DARYL: It's moving, it's moving,
it's moving. Whoa.

730
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,246
Hey, Allison, what's happening?

731
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,411
Keep filming.

732
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,130
- Whoa!
- Guys! Look at that!

733
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,687
Reevis! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

734
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,330
- Yeah!
- You getting it?

735
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,771
No! No! Holy shit!

736
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,524
'MY truck!
'Oh' my God!

737
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,163
Dad!

738
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,650
Get out and run for the bank!

739
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,770
Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry!

740
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,001
Oh, shit!

741
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,128
- Oh, my God!
- Dad! Hurry!

742
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,367
Go inside!

743
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,327
Trey!

744
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,285
God!

745
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,325
Hang on!

746
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,007
- Oh, my God! No, no, no!
- Hang on!

747
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,685
Dad, hold on!

748
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,009
- Oh, God! Aah!
- I've got you!

749
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,207
Hold on!

750
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,044
I won't let you go!

751
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,767
Grab the door!

752
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,722
No. Dad, no!

753
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,405
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

754
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,165
Are you okay?

755
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,651
Yeah.

756
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,370
- Allison, you okay?
- Come on, Trey. Let's get in the car.

757
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,920
- Everyone here?
- Yeah.

758
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,730
This is crazy, guys.

759
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,485
Oh, shit.

760
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,250
Whoa.

761
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,844
Hey, can I use your cell?
My son's out there. I got no signal.

762
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,968
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

763
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,884
I don't either.

764
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,087
Where is he?

765
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,562
He said he was at an industrial park
on Garner Road.

766
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,926
Is that north of here?

767
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,606
- This is crazy.
- This is what we're paying you for.

768
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,250
Give me one second.

769
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,169
Guys, what's going on?

770
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,046
Daryl, can you believe this?
Your buddy here wants to quit.

771
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,767
Hey. No one's quitting here.
Just give us a minute, Pete.

772
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,445
You got a minute.

773
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,650
You'll be okay. Right?

774
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,208
This is crazy, man, all right?
I mean, a truck almost fell on us.

775
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,441
Relax.

776
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,602
Make it through today, and by next week...

777
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,804
...you got cash and you are sitting
on a beach sipping margaritas...

778
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,646
...with that beautiful girlfriend of yours.
All right?

779
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,081
- I don't even like margaritas.
- Heh. Trust me.

780
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,722
Come on, we're wasting time.
Daryl, just take his damn camera from him.

781
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,927
He's got this.

782
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,447
- Let's get ready for the next system.
- All right.

783
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,806
Another system?

784
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,088
Wait a minute. That was going north, right?

785
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,930
That's toward the paper mill.

786
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,165
I gotta get there. Can you take us?
My car is totaled.

787
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,483
- Sorry. No time.
- His son's out there.

788
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,210
Pete.

789
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,360
Just stay out of the way.

790
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,409
You guys can come in the van with me.

791
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,450
- I can take the kid with the camera.
- Really? Sweet.

792
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,489
No, no, Trey, you're staying with me.

793
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,480
Look, the <i>Titus</i> is the
safest place for him.

794
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,843
He's right. It's a tank.
We'll be right behind him.

795
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,480
- Just as far as Garner, okay?
- Right.

796
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,605
Keep that camera rolling. When this is
over, I'll give you 3 grand for your tape.

797
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,807
- Three grand?
- Yeah.

798
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,804
- Heh. You got it.
- Now we're talking.

799
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,291
Let's move!

800
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,364
How's your leg?

801
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,564
It's a bit better.

802
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,125
Here.

803
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,529
- Ah.
- All right?

804
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,284
Okay.

805
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,168
Where'd you learn that?

806
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,051
Uh, my mom was a nurse...

807
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,205
...so when we were kids, instead of
story time, we'd have, like, CPR lessons.

808
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,247
At the time I was kind of lobbying
for Cat <i>in the</i> Hat, but now...

809
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,051
Ha, ha. Yeah, thanks, Mom.

810
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,522
- Okay?
- Yeah.

811
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,289
Thanks.

812
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,163
I told my parents I was
going to the library.

813
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,607
Your dad is coming, right?

814
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,162
Someone will find us.

815
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,404
You okay?

816
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,923
Look, I waited my whole life
for a storm like this.

817
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,969
Please don't let me down.

818
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,604
Who you trying to reach?

819
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,405
My little girl, Gracie.

820
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,643
I've never been away from her
this long before.

821
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,564
Where is she?

822
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,007
She's with my parents about 200 miles
to the south.

823
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,123
They'll make sure she's safe.

824
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,046
Yeah. It just really feels wrong
to be away from her right now. You know?

825
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,809
How old is Gracie?

826
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,007
She just turned 5.

827
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,966
Wow.

828
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,801
- They're a real handful at that age.
- She's a really good kid.

829
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,803
How old is your other son?

830
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,764
Donnie? He's 17.

831
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,166
He'll be all right.
He knows everything at that age.

832
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,489
After his mom died,
I kind of lost him for a while.

833
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,404
We'll find him.

834
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,001
So is this what you guys do for a living?
Go around chasing trouble?

835
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,280
They chase. I study.

836
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,164
Makes me the grown-up. Right, Daryl?

837
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,608
I've never heard
of this many tornadoes before.

838
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,003
It's a freak occurrence.
Two storm fronts taking the same path.

839
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,607
It's not freak anymore.
Not after Katrina. Not after Joplin.

840
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,367
What used to be once-in-a-lifetime
seems to be happening about once a year.

841
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,363
Look what happened with Hurricane Sandy.

842
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,443
Whatever it is, we have to figure it out...

843
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,206
...before they start shifting to places
they've never been before.

844
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,921
- Like where?
- Like Los Angeles. Or Chicago.

845
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,646
Even London.

846
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,161
<i>Tree blocking the road.</i>

847
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,721
- We got a problem.
- Can you get around that?

848
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,361
No.

849
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,090
Moorpark. <i>Right,</i> Dad?

850
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,005
<i>It's about three miles west.
It might be clear that far out.</i>

851
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,207
Good call.

852
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,522
Doubling back to Moorpark.

853
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,448
That's a great boy you've got.

854
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,563
Do you ever think about the last thing
you said to your mom?

855
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,482
I think about it every day.

856
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,410
Um...

857
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,123
Because I was pissed at her.

858
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,363
I was always pissed at her for something.

859
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,763
For leaving Dad. For leaving me and Trey.

860
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:13,088
We used to spend the weekends with her,
so she was...

861
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,369
She was dropping us back, and she tried
to kiss me goodbye, and I just...

862
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,203
I barely looked at her,
and she walked away.

863
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,251
Yeah, that was it. That was the last time.

864
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,283
What happened?

865
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,448
It was a car accident.

866
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,962
- I'm sorry.
- No.

867
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,565
It's...

868
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,049
You hear that?

869
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,247
Hello?

870
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,129
Hey! Hey, we're down here!

871
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,089
- Hello?
- Please help us!

872
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,520
- What happened?
- I think a pipe burst!

873
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,921
Oh, my God!

874
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,960
Get on it, Donk. You see anything yet?

875
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,602
- I think the twister cloud's up ahead.
- Twister cloud?

876
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,566
Shit! Slow down, Donk!
You're busting my balls!

877
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,769
Straight over this hill!
You'll be fine! - No! Not the hill!

878
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,331
Hey! Moron!

879
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,129
Oh, my God!

880
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,124
Ugh! Damn! You dumb-ass!

881
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,442
- What the hell, man?
- Whoo! Yeah!

882
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,729
- You all right, man?
- Yes! Ha-ha-ha.

883
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,563
Whoa.

884
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,802
Aw. This thing's awesome.

885
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,086
- She's a beast.
- Absolutely.

886
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,521
Wow, this is so cool.

887
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,484
You gonna be all right?

888
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,971
Look, I know I yell at you a lot.
But listen.

889
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,803
When I first started,
I was scared shitless too.

890
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,928
We got a lot riding on this.
But when the moment comes...

891
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,048
...trust me, you're gonna be fine.

892
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,290
Yes, sir.

893
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,885
You getting this on radar?

894
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,327
I see it. It's headed
fast in this direction.

895
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,801
<i>I got three small hook echoes. Maybe four.</i>

896
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,566
- D, you getting any visual on this?
- No. Nothing.

897
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,802
I'm not seeing anything, you guys.

898
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,564
What's happening up top, kid?

899
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,089
I got nothing up here. Just clouds.
Wait, there it is. Right there on the left!

900
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,846
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

901
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,570
We got movement to the northeast.

902
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,045
Take a look at that!

903
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,041
Guys, it's splitting.

904
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,203
- We're gonna have another funnel.
- Something's happening behind us.

905
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,566
There's another one.

906
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,643
There's one to our right!

907
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,805
Two.

908
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,729
There are three. Four!
Shit, they're everywhere!

909
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,645
We have multiple vortices touching down.

910
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,525
These systems are too erratic.
We gotta get out of here.

911
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,444
No, no, no!

912
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,289
- Look at that thing!
- Aah!

913
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,771
Oh, my God!

914
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,329
Oh, God!

915
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,280
Look at the size of that thing!

916
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,006
We're gonna be YouTube stars
for the rest of our lives!

917
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,527
Ha, ha! Better than sex, Donk! Ha-ha-ha.

918
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,762
How would you know?

919
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,321
Dad!

920
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,686
Behind us!

921
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,567
Is everybody all right?

922
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:16,807
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.

923
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,604
Oh, shit.

924
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,682
- Keep filming!
- Yeah, I got it!

925
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,649
This is unbelievable!

926
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,723
- Dad!
- Are you all right?

927
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,049
I can't get out the side.
We're gonna go through the back.

928
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,362
- Trey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

929
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,527
Let's go!

930
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,405
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on. Come on.

931
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,921
- Trey!
- Over here!

932
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,771
We gotta take cover! Everybody in
the Titus! Run! Let's move! Move!

933
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,684
- Come on!
- Let's go!

934
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,330
Look out!

935
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,964
Come on!

936
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,769
Everybody head for the church!

937
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,968
- Come on, Trey, stay with me!
- Look out!

938
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,207
Holy shit!

939
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,005
Oh, my God!

940
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,761
This is amazing! I gotta get this!

941
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,887
Jake, forget it!

942
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,323
Jake, come on!

943
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,167
Allison!

944
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,570
- Jake!
- Jacob!

945
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,449
- My camera!
- Leave it!

946
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,250
But I gotta get the footage!

947
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,129
Jake, come on! Let's go!

948
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,203
Shit!

949
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,924
- No! No, no, no!
- Come on!

950
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,282
Help me! No, no, no!

951
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,922
- No! Jacob!
- No! He's gone! Allison, he's gone!

952
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,320
- Get inside!
- Shut the door!

953
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:27,891
Come on, come on, come on!

954
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,490
Get down!

955
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,130
Okay.

956
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,566
Oh, shit.

957
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,763
Trey. Trey!

958
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,644
I'm here, Dad.

959
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,325
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

960
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,441
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting my son.

961
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,881
Please, wait. It isn't safe out there.

962
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,849
What if it was your daughter?

963
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,765
Um...

964
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,445
If we can get the van back on the road, we'll
be safer than we would be on foot. Okay?

965
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,443
Pete, can you hook up...?

966
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,570
Is that all you care about?

967
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,210
No. No.

968
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,681
Jacob's dead, Pete.

969
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,170
He'd probably still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

970
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,289
You think what happened is my fault?

971
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,444
I mean, he wasn't out there shooting
for himself, was he?

972
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,321
He was getting your shot for your movie...

973
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,962
...because you told him nothing else
matters, and you wouldn't let him go.

974
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,360
No.

975
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,604
It wasn't Pete.

976
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,970
It was me.

977
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,927
I brought him here. It was my fault.

978
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,562
No. No. None of this should have happened.

979
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,529
You gotta help him find his son.

980
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,648
I will. What about you?

981
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,643
I'm gonna stay here.

982
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,524
I'll see if I can find Jacob's parents.
Get in contact with them.

983
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,931
Okay.

984
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,443
- Help me close up the gap!
- Huh?

985
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,728
Help me close it up!

986
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,088
- Can you stop it coming in?
- I'm trying!

987
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,769
Lucas, you coming?

988
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,526
Pete...

989
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,162
Suit yourself. I gotta finish this.

990
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,411
Trey, come on. Get in.

991
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,642
- Let's go find your brother.
- All right.

992
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,407
Come on, baby.

993
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,807
Come on.

994
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,964
That's my girl.

995
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,248
Dad, it's getting worse out there.

996
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,283
Still no signal.

997
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,646
My phone. It's not working.

998
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,802
<i>Try yours.</i>

999
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,608
No, there's no signal.

1000
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,202
- Try it through the gap right there.
- Okay.

1001
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,488
Your arm can fit.

1002
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,242
- Oh, my God. There's a bar, there's a bar.
- Put it on speakerphone!

1003
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,323
<i>This is Gary. Leave</i> a <i>message.</i>

1004
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,642
Dad! Dad! Please help us!

1005
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,883
The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring in...

1006
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,168
...and I don't know how long we've got!

1007
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,560
Dad!

1008
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,841
Aah.

1009
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,764
Oh, shit!

1010
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,843
Oh, shit.

1011
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,762
I'm sorry. It's dead.

1012
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,649
I'm sorry.

1013
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,289
Are you folks all right?
I'm taking these people to the shelter.

1014
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,762
- You been by the industrial park?
- Sure have. Whole place has been flattened.

1015
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,163
- Did you see anyone? A boy? A girl?
- I didn't see anybody. I'm sorry.

1016
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,324
- Maybe he made it to the school.
- What if he didn't? We gotta go.

1017
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,324
Listen. I heard on the radio,
all the warning sirens are down.

1018
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,767
If a tornado's coming,
you're not gonna know it.

1019
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,045
Okay.

1020
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,360
Mom.

1021
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,965
Dad.

1022
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,930
I just wanna thank you for everything.

1023
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,770
I was gonna come down the stairs
this morning to say goodbye...

1024
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,527
...but when I came you were already gone.

1025
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,886
I got a message.

1026
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,520
<i>Dad! Dad! Please help us!</i>

1027
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,570
<i>The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring</i> in...

1028
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,883
- ...and <i>I</i> don't know how long we've <i>got!</i>
- Oh, my God.

1029
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,721
You should know I'm not alone.

1030
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,128
Donnie's here.

1031
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,769
He's been really sweet.

1032
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:25,368
So it's kind of okay.

1033
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,442
I love you so much.

1034
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,044
Guess what.

1035
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,766
I spent the last week filming time capsules
about people's futures...

1036
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,207
...and now it looks like I don't have one.

1037
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,004
So, uh...

1038
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,682
...if there's no future...

1039
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,768
...we should talk about the past.

1040
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,561
Um...

1041
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,721
Some bad shit happened along the way.

1042
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,884
You know, like it does
to everybody, I guess.

1043
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,491
And...

1044
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,243
And I didn't move on, Dad. I blamed you.

1045
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,929
I really gave you shit,
and I wish I hadn't.

1046
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,727
I so wish I hadn't.

1047
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,688
No point in wishing now, huh?

1048
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,723
What do I wanna say? Um...

1049
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,368
Go easy on Trey.

1050
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,726
He's gonna tell you that
this is all his fault.

1051
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,844
This was his idea. But it wasn't.

1052
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,970
It's just Trey. His
attention-seeking behavior.

1053
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,129
My idea.

1054
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,164
My fault.

1055
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,563
Trey, you should be the person you always
were, dude, because you're awesome.

1056
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,721
You're awesome and I'm proud of you...

1057
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,724
...and just live every
day like it's your last.

1058
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,121
Because, shit, someday it will be.

1059
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,646
And for once, I know
what I'm talking about.

1060
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,250
And, Dad...

1061
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,729
Dad, I love you.

1062
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,964
I really love you and I'm sorry.

1063
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,009
Okay, I'm sorry.

1064
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,242
Okay. Sorry.

1065
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,601
Sorry.

1066
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,086
Come here.

1067
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,605
Okay.

1068
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,807
All right.

1069
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,283
Come on.

1070
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,171
Take a left here.

1071
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,451
Donnie!

1072
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,971
Donnie!

1073
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,246
Trey!

1074
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,243
Look!

1075
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,840
Hello?

1076
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,411
It's Donnie's!

1077
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,606
Donnie!

1078
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,807
Donnie!

1079
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,570
Where are you?

1080
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,960
Kaitlyn!

1081
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,088
Over here!

1082
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,082
He said there was water pouring in, right?

1083
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,004
Dad! Over here!

1084
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,481
Listen! Nobody move!

1085
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,688
We're over here!

1086
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,446
- Donnie!
- Dad!

1087
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,130
- Where is he?
- It's okay.

1088
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,362
- Donnie, I'm here!
- We got you.

1089
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,769
It's okay! I'm here! I got you!
It's Dad! Can you hear me?

1090
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,207
Dad! Trey!

1091
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,967
Dad!

1092
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,566
Dad, you've gotta help him!

1093
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,722
Can you swim through? There's a gap here!

1094
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,006
Now you hold on!

1095
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,281
Donnie!

1096
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,366
Gary, I can't move it!

1097
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,764
We gotta move this! We gotta move
this I-beam! Come on, push it!

1098
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,725
- It's not gonna move.
- Dad!

1099
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,840
- Donnie, you're okay.
- Help me get her out.

1100
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,967
You're doing good.

1101
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,281
We're gonna get you out.

1102
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,565
Trey, what are you doing?

1103
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,250
Watch out!

1104
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,890
Okay, I need you to duck down!

1105
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,849
We're gonna move this beam!
You understand?

1106
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,161
Got it!

1107
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,725
You guys Okay?

1109
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,610
- Kaitlyn, come on.

1110
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,082
- I got you, I got you.
- Let's go, let's go. Get her out.

1111
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,330
Donnie!

1112
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,570
Donnie!

1113
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,043
- Donnie!

1114
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,361
Pull him up!

1115
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,851
I got his head.

1116
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,365
Get him up.

1117
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,767
Donnie?

1118
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,410
Right here. Here we go.

1119
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,085

Donnie?

1121
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,722
Put this under his head.

1122
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,290
He's not breathing!

1123
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,891
Oh, God!

1124
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,649

1125
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,122
Donnie!

1126
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,929
Breathe!

1127

01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,129
Here. It's okay.

1131
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:45,607

01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,249
So much.

1139
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,369
I thought you might need some help.

1140
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,683
Never thought I'd be happy
to see your face again.

1141
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,045
Getting my hard drives.

1142
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,090
- You were down there?
- Yeah.

1143
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,322
- Camera rolling?
Uh-huh.

1144
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,764
- Mm.
- Yeah, there's the guy I know.

1145
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,888
- Guys, we gotta get out of here.
- Come on.

1146
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,451
Everybody in the Titus.

1147
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,922
<i>We are tracking</i> a <i>massive tornado.</i>

1148
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:43,326
Pete, you seeing this?

1149
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,680
<i>- There's</i> a <i>second tornado formation.
</i>- I <i>see it.</i>

1150
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,770
<i>This storm is heading northwest.
There. And it just touched down.</i>

1151
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,806
<i>We now have two very large tornadoes
moving towards the town of Silverton.</i>

1152
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,282
<i>All residents of Shaw County
should seek shelter immediately.</i>

1153
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,762
<i>They are converging, which could
generate wind speeds of up to</i> a...

1154
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,400
<i>There! There they go!
They just converged.</i>

1155
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:06,810
<i>We are looking at wind speeds inside
the funnel of over 300 miles per hour.</i>

1156
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,201
<i>This is definitely an EF5.</i>

1157
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,721
This is the biggest tornado I've ever seen.

1158
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,322
- The school.
- The whole town's in there.

1159
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,562
Warning systems are out.

1160
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,884
They're sitting ducks.

1161
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,561
Okay, everybody out. Now. Let's go.

1162
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,807
Hurry! Get out! Go!

1163
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,883
What are you doing? You out of your mind?

1164
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,647
- There is another tornado heading this way.
- And you want us to go outside?

1165
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,560
- You don't understand.
- You have to.

1166
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,682
This is the storm shelter, for chrissake.

1167
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,604
- Not for this.
- Would you believe us?

1168
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,603
We've been out there.
We know what this can do.

1169
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,684
I am not going to risk it.
I've got hundreds of people here.

1170
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:59,922
You will have hundreds of dead people
if you stay.

1171
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,327
Sir. I've studied storms all my life,
all right?

1172
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,643
This is bigger than any storm
that has ever been. Can you hear that?

1173
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,644
- It will flatten this building in seconds.
- Exactly.

1174
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,963
With or without you, we're getting
these people onto those buses.

1175
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,962
- Trey, stay with me. Stay close.
- Okay.

1176
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,250
Come on, everybody!
Get on the buses! Move!

1177
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,807
We gotta go.

1178
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,360
That one! That one over there!

1179
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,122
- Stay with us!

1180
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,127
Come on, move!

1181
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,169
Trey, put the camera down
and get on the bus.

1182
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,328
- I'm coming.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

1183
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:38,641
Come on, folks.

01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,165
Everybody on. Move, move, move.

1186
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,560
Come on, get in there.

1187
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,046
Trey, get in.

1188
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,845
- Come on, Trey, come on, come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

1189
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,284
Hold on.

1190
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,846
Holy shit. Lucas, you getting this?

1191
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,764
Yeah. We good.

1192
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,364
- How we looking?
- It's still picking up speed.

1193
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,524
Dad! Dad, the tower's coming down!

1194
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,810
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out!
- Hang on!

1195
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,243
Dad, be careful!

1196
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,609
- We can't get through. There's no way
around. We don't have any time.

1197
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,240
- We gotta go back.
- Okay.

1198
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,331
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

1199
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,768
Come in the bus.
Come in the bus with us.

1200
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,531
You guys, we gotta back up!
We gotta go back and find a road!

1201
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,281
Gary, we need cover.
We can't stay in the open.

1202
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:36,403
It's moving too fast.
We're not gonna outrun it.

1203
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,844
<i>The road's blocked. We gotta turn around.</i>

1204
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,603
- No, Dad, pull over up here.
- What?

1205
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,924
Dad, trust me, okay? I filmed here.
There's a storm drain. Right over there.

1206
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,171
- Okay, everybody get off.
- All right, come on! Come on!

1207
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,088
All right, this way!

1208

Come on, you guys. Let's go. Let's go.

1209
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,807
- Come on!
- Follow me this way!

1210
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,442
Dad! Dad! We can't get in this way!

1211
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,041
- Go in through the manhole!
- Manhole?

1212
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,043
- You got a crowbar?
- Yeah.

1213
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,847
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Lucas!

1214
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,725
Come on.

1215

01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,163
Get in.

1219
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,167

- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1226
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,611
- Give me a hand.
- I got it.

1227
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,601
- Close it!
- Come on!

1228
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,047
Oh, shit!

1229
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,807
- You guys all right?
- The truck opened the other end! Hang on!

1230
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,571
It's gonna be a wind tunnel in here!
Hold on tight!

1231
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,768
- Oh, my God, the grate's loose!
- Hold on!

1232
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,924
- We're gonna get sucked out!
- Keep your head down!

1233
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,801
Hey, this footage and data
could save lives one day!

1234
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,041
What are you doing?

1235
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,570
Pete?

1236
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,250
- No, no! Wait!

1237
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,526
Pete!

1238
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,247
Pete!

1239
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,407
Lucas! Give me that!

1240
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,164
Peter, please, come back!

1241
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,160
Gary!

1242
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,563
No! Allison! I can't reach!

1243
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,285

Okay, anchor down.

1250
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,367
- What's he doing?
- He's trying to plug the hole!

1251
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,130
Damn it. She won't stay anchored.

1252
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:34,164
Allison! Allison!

1253
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,560
<i>Can you hitch the winch to something solid?</i>

1254
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,842
- The truck!
- Yeah.

1255
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,206
- The release.
- Here.

1256
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,049
Okay, I got it.

1257
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,564
- We're good!
- All right, Pete, we're set.

1258
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,370
<i>You can tighten her up.</i>

1259
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,123
Okay, then.

1260
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,250
Titus versus tornado.

1261
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,647
- Dad, hang on!
- Gary!

1262
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,642
Hang on!

1263
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,321
Is that it? Is it over?

1264
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:41,323
Pete, what's happening? Did it pass us?

1265
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,010
It's not gonna last.

1266
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,810
We're in the eye.

1267
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,484
Oh, God.

1268
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,522
Guys, the trailing winds will be
even stronger! You've gotta hang on!

1269
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,767
Okay.

1270
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,729
Hold on tight.

1271
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,051
Hold on!

1272
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:24,202
Donnie! Get down!

1273
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,409
It's not gonna hold!

1274
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,721
Peter!

1275
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,564
No!

1276
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,244
Grab my hand! No!

1277
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,244
- No!
- Gary!

1278
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,007
<i>And let's see. We're gonna stay right here.</i>

1279
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,571
<i>We're gonna see if it re-cycles.</i>

1280
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,007
<i>It's becoming more of a barrel-shaped.</i>

1281
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,324
<i>The wedge has decreased a little bit, and it
looks like it's roping out at Air Depot Road.</i>

1282
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,970
<i>Look at the rope on that thing.</i>

1283
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:56,920
<i>Feeder band looks like it's pretty low
to the ground. It's way lower than we are.</i>

1284
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,606
<i>There it is. It's gone, Mike.</i>

1285
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,841
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

1286
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,526
- Yeah, we're good.
- You're okay.

1287
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,487
Trey?

1288
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,882
<i>This was a storm that was on the
ground for at least 10 miles before it hit.</i>

1289
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:53,283
<i>...assault by giant tornadoes.
And look how powerful they are.</i>

1290
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:56,603
<i>One tornado is already being
called the largest tornado in history.</i>

1291
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,840
<i>The intense storm
that set off the twisters...</i>

1292
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,769
<i>...dropped golf ball to
baseball-sized hail.</i>

1293
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,443
<i>There's no denying the tragedy
that we've all endured here today.</i>

1294
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,284
<i>But you know...</i>

1295
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,081
<i>...our faith will carry us through,
and we will rebuild.</i>

1296
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,288
I'm sorry about Pete.

1297
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,681
Hey, little bug.

1298
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:33,444
<i>Hey-</i>

1299
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,728
No, Mama's okay. I'm okay.

1300
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:37,325
I am. I promise.

1301
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,482
I'm coming home.

1302
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,007
Yeah, Mama's coming home.

1303
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,241
I love you too.

1304
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,326
<i>In 25 years?</i>

1305
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,768
It doesn't matter, you know?

1306
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,766
Just taking it one day at a time.

1307
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,207
Every day's just fine.

1308
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,403
Because I'm alive.

1309
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,050
That's it.

1310
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,611
Nothing else matters.

1311
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,842
Sometimes I think the human race
as a species is crazy.

1312
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,685
But when the chips are down...

1313
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,571
...ordinary people, like you and me...

1314
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,131
...are good.

1315
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,645
I like that.

1316
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,521
You know, Pete and I had our moments...

1317
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:31,926
...but I know why he got up every morning.

1318
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,048
And I know why he gave up his life.

1319
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,567
He wanted to make a difference and...

1320
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,445
Um...

1321
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,963
Well, hopefully this film
will help accomplish that.

1322
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,360
Huh?

1323
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,966
Uh, to be honest,
it didn't look good back there.

1324
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,406
But we made it.

1325
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:56,404
We stuck together, and here we are.

1326
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,085
Alive.

1327
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,127
I'm just grateful that we'll be able
to look back on this in 25 years.

1328
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,080
Twenty-five years?
Wow. You are gonna be so old.

1329
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:07,571
- Heh.
- And probably bald too.

1330
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,960
All right, you're cut off.

1331
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,566
Donnie, you have something
you wanna say?

1332
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,768
Uh, I don't think we really have
to say anything, you know?

1333
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,446
We're all here now. Together.

1334
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,924
And that's all that matters.

1335
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,889
Yeah, it is.

1336
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,323
Okay. Let's get back to work.

1337
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,690
<i>Hey! Donk!</i>

1338
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,842
<i>Donk, where are you?</i>

1339
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,764
Over here!

1340
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,285
Hey, you're upside down!

1341
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,046
No, you're upside down!
And you're in a tree!

1342
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,004
Well, so are you!

1343
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:48,207
Oh, yeah.

1344
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,283
That camera still working?

1345
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,488
- Yeah, it is!
- Ha, ha.

1346
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,723
- Man, we are gonna be so rich!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1347
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:56,967
<i>Oh, shit! Donk!</i>

1347
01:23:57,305 --> 01:24:57,408
