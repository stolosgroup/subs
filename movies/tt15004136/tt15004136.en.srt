00:00:57,397 --> 00:00:59,628
You must be
the dumbest motherfucker alive.

3
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:01,663
You kidnapped a woman
in broad daylight!

4
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:03,599
Think nobody saw that shit?

5
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:06,899
You're doin' life!
You're doin' life.

6
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,441
So, tell me where she is.

7
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,609
Tell me.

8
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:16,447
I'll make you feel so good.

9
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,780
J... just tell me where she is.

10
00:01:19,815 --> 00:01:22,849
I will snap your fucking shit.

11
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:23,850
Where is she?

12
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,853
She's fuckin' dead, man.

13
00:01:26,888 --> 00:01:28,723
She's fuckin' dead.

14
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:33,530
You killed her?

15
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:16,540
Can you um, can you just
turn it down a little bit?

16
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:19,708
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

17
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:31,324
I... I uh, stocked the fridge,
everything that you like.

18
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,591
I know, I saw.

19
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,828
I reckon
you're gonna miss me a bit.

20
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:44,205
Of course, I am.

21
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:48,473
I'm sorry, Will.

22
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:04,654
Listen, I just wanna say that...

23
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,955
I know we said we weren't gonna
talk about it, but...

24
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,463
What was his name again?

25
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:12,893
Will, just don't.

26
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,664
Anyway, just wanna say that...

27
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:22,672
I know that was hard for you
to talk about it.

28
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,478
Just in case, it's in your head
or something I just...

29
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:31,978
I just want you to know
that I forgive you.

30
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:33,881
And I'm... I'm...
I'm good with it.

31
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,983
I'm not good...
I'm not good with it...

32
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:44,298
but I appreciate you
bein' honest with me.

33
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:52,339
Finally, we're almost there.

34
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:54,935
Yeah,
I'm gonna have to pull over

35
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,969
and get some gas.

36
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,576
Almost run empty.

37
00:03:58,611 --> 00:04:01,414
Uh, it's only about 15 minutes
to my parents' house.

38
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,778
- Are you that low?
- Uh, actually, I am.

39
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,683
Unless you wanna get out
and push the car.

40
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:09,785
Mm, I do not want to do that.

41
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,326
Shut up then.

42
00:04:27,805 --> 00:04:32,005
- Are you gonna get gas?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,273
I was gonna throw it out there,
though.

44
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:37,076
What do you say, I fill her up
and we drive back to Manchester?

45
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,815
Or off into the sunset or...

46
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,080
- Off into the sunset?
- Or...

47
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,818
- I don't know. Something.
- Hmm.

48
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,523
We could go on a holiday,
we could...

49
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:47,119
Look, I... I need this break,
I need to clear my mind.

50
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,022
I need to gain
a better perspective.

51
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:53,026
This is the best I can do, okay?

52
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:54,401
Yeah.

53
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:01,738
Well... at least,
it's your mother's.

54
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:04,444
I mean after two weeks with her

55
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,711
and you're gonna be desperate
to come back and see me.

56
00:05:07,746 --> 00:05:10,879
- No?
- Uh, well, we'll see.

57
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:14,619
I'm gonna grab some water.

58
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:15,686
Get some gas.

59
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,771
Oh, fuck.

60
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:20,487
Yo, Nate. Will.

61
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,100
No, no, no, you
can't pull out of the deal.

62
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:41,468
I owe this money to my subs.

63
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:43,543
<i>Look, Will,
I understand, but you gotta say.</i>

64
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:44,907
- Hi, just this.
- That's it?

65
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,546
Yeah.

66
00:06:50,046 --> 00:06:52,211
- Thanks. You can keep it.
- Thank you.

67
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:59,625
Uh, uh, excuse me.

68
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:15,267
Thanks.

69
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,093
Lisa.

70
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:15,734
Lisa?

71
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,018
Hello?

72
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,841
Excuse me,
I'm looking for my wife.

73
00:08:56,876 --> 00:08:57,941
You didn't see a woman in here

74
00:08:57,976 --> 00:09:00,911
She's wearin' white top, jeans.

75
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,044
- No?
- Check the bathroom.

76
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:04,343
Yeah, I just...
I just checked 'em.

77
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,982
Okay, I don't know.

78
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,364
<i>Hi, you've reached Lisa.</i>

79
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,674
<i>Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.</i>

80
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:30,303
Hey, Lisa, it's me.

81
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,206
Hey, where are you?

82
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,109
I'm at the other side
of the gas station.

83
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:35,748
You gonna call me back,
I'm lookin' for you.

84
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,316
Excuse me!

85
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,989
Did you see a woman in a...
Uh, she's wearin' a white top,

86
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:49,355
blue jeans, dark hair,
walkin' around out here?

87
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,895
No, I haven't.

88
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,739
Lisa!

89
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:05,404
Lisa!

90
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:09,111
What the fuck?

91
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,819
Lisa!

92
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:18,450
Hi, you've reached Lisa.

93
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,122
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

94
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:22,190
All right, Lis,
this isn't funny.

95
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:25,391
Where'd you go?

96
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:26,832
All right, listen,
you gotta call me back.

97
00:10:26,867 --> 00:10:28,900
I'm lookin' for you,
I'm gettin' worried.

98
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,869
Wait inside the gas station.

99
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:38,206
Sure you didn't see anybody
in here?

100
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,977
White top.

101
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:41,110
- Yeah, no, you saw...
- Thick dark hair. Yeah.

102
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,045
White top, I heard you.

103
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,718
Um, what'd she buy?

104
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,984
I think she was getting water
or maybe something else.

105
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,887
- I don't know.
- All right, I don't know.

106
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:51,483
Uh, check the car maybe.

107
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:53,089
I'll check it again.

108
00:10:53,124 --> 00:10:54,354
But if you see her,
will you let her know

109
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:55,894
just stay here?

110
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:56,928
Her name's Lisa.

111
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:57,830
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah?

112
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,531
Sure.

113
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,800
Thanks. Uh.

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,364
Lisa!

115
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:08,500
Hey, you didn't see a... a...
A woman in a white shirt?

116
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,172
- Mm-mm.
- Walking around here?

117
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,207
You didn't see a woman in a...
A white T-shirt

118
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,275
with thick dark hair?

119
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,784
Guys, did you see a woman
walkin' around here.

120
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:19,313
She was wearin' a white T-shirt.

121
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:23,416
Lisa!

122
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,315
Come on, Lisa.

123
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:09,099
Lisa!

124
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,409
Will: Hey buddy, sorry
to bother you again.

125
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:24,147
I can't find my wife anywhere.

126
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:26,446
So give... give me the...
The address of this gas station.

127
00:12:26,481 --> 00:12:28,250
101, Route 64.

128
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,483
Is there a local number
for the police here?

129
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,991
Uh, 9-1-1.

130
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:34,091
9-1-1.

131
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,895
Okay, thanks.

132
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,105
<i>Sergeant Anderson, 9-1-1.</i>

133
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,843
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

134
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,977
<i>Uh, yeah, I would like to report
a... a... a missing person,</i>

135
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:53,176

136
00:12:53,211 --> 00:12:56,179
<i>Um, yeah, she...
I... I can't find her.</i>

137
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:58,247
Hey,
Roy, you mind taking line three?

138
00:12:58,282 --> 00:12:59,479
Name's Spann.

139
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,019
Said he lost his wife
at the Veldro station.

140
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:02,152
Lost his wife?

141
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,121
Yeah, that's what he said.

142
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:04,855
All right, thanks.

143
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,585
All right.

144
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,386
<i>Mr. Spann,
this is Detective Paterson.</i>

145
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,191
- Yeah.
<i>- So, uh...</i>

146
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:09,626
Hi.

147
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,293
<i>You're sayin'
you... you can't find your wife.</i>

148
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:11,127
Yeah, I can't find my wife.

149
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,394
I... we... I...
I stopped to get gas,

150
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,198
she came in to get a drink,
and...

151
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,365
And that was
like 20 minutes ago.

152
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I've been...
I can't see her anywhere.

153
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:21,204
<i>Well, it's not very long.</i>

154
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:22,403
You checked the bathroom?

155
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:23,943
Yeah, yeah,
I checked the bathroom,

156
00:13:23,978 --> 00:13:25,307
I checked
the whole damn gas station.

157
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:27,375
I've been all around the front,
and the back, and...

158
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,948
<i>Okay, Mr. Spann, okay.</i>

159
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:29,849
What's your...
What's your wife's name?

160
00:13:29,884 --> 00:13:31,280
<i>Her name is Lisa Spann.</i>

161
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:32,479

162
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:35,086
Yeah, she's 5'9",
she's uh, dark hair,

163
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,318
and she's wearin'
a pair of blue jeans,

164
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:38,221
and a... and a white T-shirt.

165
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:39,992
<i>- Short sleeves.</i>
- Okay.

166
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,653
- Is she from the area?
- No.

167
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,358
Well, originally,
she's from this area.

168
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:44,491
Yeah, I mean her parents

169
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:45,965
just live along the road
in Emerson.

170
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,429
Well,
maybe she ran into a friend.

171
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:52,004
Do you think your wife
would just run off with a friend

172
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,039
when I'm putting gas in the car?

173
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:55,106
<i>Uh, uh, all right, all right.</i>

174
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:56,668
<i>Listen, Mr. Spann, just relax.</i>

175
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,175
<i>I'll dispatch someone
as soon as possible.</i>

176
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,507
What... what...
what is soon as possible?

177
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,608
<i>Well, listen, I
don't have anyone available just now.</i>

178
00:14:02,643 --> 00:14:03,576
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>
- All right, well, I... listen,

179
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,248
we're in a bit
of an emergency here, okay?

180
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,513
There's truck drivers
everywhere.

181
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:08,251
Well,
I mean time is of the essence.

182
00:14:08,286 --> 00:14:09,318
She could be anywhere.

183
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:10,990
<i>She could be in danger.</i>

184
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,552
I understand
you're stressed out.

185
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,928
I'll send someone
as soon as possible, okay?

186
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,226
Okay, okay, okay.

187
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,359
<i>I'll come myself if I have to.</i>

188
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:19,064
Okay. Okay, thank you.

189
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:20,626
Just be as quick as you can,
okay?

190
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,463
<i>Stay by your
phone, keep your phone on,</i>

191
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:23,629
<i>and stay put.</i>

192
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,202
Oh, shit.

193
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:17,056
<i>We're
not in. Please leave a message.</i>

194
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,521
Hey, Barry, Anna, it's Will.

195
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:22,259
Can you guys call me back?
I'm lookin' for Lisa.

196
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,260
Thank you, bye.

197
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:25,757
Fuck.

198
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:51,285
Lisa?

199
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,158
I think that's them, sweetie.

200
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:55,787
- Lisa.
- You got it?

201
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:56,287
Hi, Will.

202
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,064
- Hi.
- Oh.

203
00:15:58,099 --> 00:15:59,758
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, I'm good. Where's Lisa?

204
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,694
Uh, I... I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

205
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:03,465
Is she here?

206
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,039
No, she's not... she's with you.

207
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,107
No, she was with me.

208
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:09,801
- Lisa!
- Hello.

209
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,243
- Well, she's not here.
- Okay, okay.

210
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:14,608
- Barry!
- Yes, sweetie.

211
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,309
Hi.

212
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,677
- Hey, Barry!
- Will's here.

213
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,646
- Um, I... I, uh...
- What's the matter?

214
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:20,779
I don't know. Something's wrong.

215
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,220
What?

216
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:23,353
You guys didn't hear from her?
She didn't call?

217
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:24,651
- No, she's... is it...
- What? No.

218
00:16:24,686 --> 00:16:26,257
I... I... I thought
maybe she came here.

219
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,058
Uh, no, wait a second.

220
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:28,490
No, uh... uh,
weren't you supposed

221
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,097
- to drop her off here?
- Yeah.

222
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:34,331
Uh, one minute she was here,
the next minute she was gone.

223
00:16:34,366 --> 00:16:36,069
Uh, what uh,
what do you mean by that?

224
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,303
What do you mean she's gone?

225
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:42,141
We stopped to get gas,

226
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:45,342
and she went into the market,
and...

227
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:48,081
- Right.
- She didn't come back out.

228
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:48,915
I don't...

229
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,314
She's still
in the gas station then.

230
00:16:50,349 --> 00:16:52,250
No, she's not still
in the gas station.

231
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,251
- I...
- Is she in the...

232
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:54,252
In the bathroom? Did you check...

233
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:55,649
I've looked in the restrooms,
I've looked...

234
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,189
Yes, I checked the whole damn
gas station.

235
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,421
Okay, which ga...
Which gas station

236
00:16:58,456 --> 00:16:59,554
were you're at?
Let's start there.

237
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:02,260
The Veldro on uh, you know, 64.

238
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,526
Okay, that's
about five miles from here,

239
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:06,693
so she wouldn't walk from there.

240
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:09,168
So, I have to ask you this,
Will,

241
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,632
uh, did you have a fight?

242
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,107
Is that what this is?
You had a fight and...

243
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:16,538
No, Barry,
we didn't have a fight.

244
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:18,705
We're going through some stuff
as... as you know,

245
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,245
but we did not have a fight.

246
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,609
And I can't explain...
Okay, listen,

247
00:17:21,644 --> 00:17:24,117
did she have anybody else know
she was comin'?

248
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:25,877
Any friends or anything
or anybody that...

249
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,778
Just friends.

250
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,814
But did you speak
to any of her friends?

251
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,585
No, wait a second.
Wait, wait, wait!

252
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,817
Now uh, listen,
what are you saying?

253
00:17:31,852 --> 00:17:33,819
That it's because of us?
Is that it?

254
00:17:33,854 --> 00:17:35,491
- I'm not blamin' anybody.
- Now, that's insane.

255
00:17:35,526 --> 00:17:36,225
You know,
anybody else who she was...

256
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,757
No, no, please, it's insulting.

257
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,132
What are you talkin' about,
Barry!

258
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:39,899
- I'm not blaming anybody!
- Okay.

259
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,167
- You did!
- I... I'm just...

260
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:42,268
That... that was the implication.
Do you have any friends here?

261
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:43,532
I asked if you
knew she was coming here.

262
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,139
Okay!

263
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:48,438
Okay, guys,
you can think what you want,

264
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:50,242
but this is me, Will, all right?

265
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,606
- No, I...
- I... I... and this...

266
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,410
I know,
but it's not Will and Lisa.

267
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:54,807
You see,
we were expecting Will and Lisa.

268
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,215
Yeah, okay.

269
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,679
Well, let's get
about finding Lisa, okay?

270
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:00,186
I'm uh, I gotta go by.

271
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:01,087
I called the police

272
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,650
and they're comin'
at the gas station.

273
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:04,223
- You guys stay here.
- Okay.

274
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:05,686
Just in case she comes.

275
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,589
And maybe call her friends,
see if anybody heard from her.

276
00:18:07,624 --> 00:18:08,523
- Right.
- Yeah.

277
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,789
Right? And call me
if you're hear anything.

278
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:11,230
- I will, I promise.
- Of course.

279
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:12,693
All right.

280
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:13,859
Oh my God.

281
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:14,626
No, we're gonna call the cops
right now.

282
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:15,527
What do you mean
call her friends?

283
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,269
- What the fuck is that?
- I don't ev...

284
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,203
I don't understand what he said.

285
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,804
I don't even
know if I believe him

286
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,272
that he called the cops..

287
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,702
I don't either.
I don't trust him!

288
00:18:21,737 --> 00:18:23,209
This doesn't make any sense.

289
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:24,870
Oh, it makes sense to me.

290
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:27,345
Uh, he was acting weird.

291
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,511
Did you see him?

292
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:23,401
Ooh!

293
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:25,304
Hey.

294
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:27,339
I got the steering column
workin'.

295
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,073
Oh yeah?

296
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:30,342
Yeah, cables were... were fried.

297
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,311
Oh. Hmm.

298
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,774
Maybe it's time to get her wet.

299
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:38,713
- You want a drink?
- No. No, thanks.

300
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:40,649
- Okay, I'm gonna have a beer.
- Okay.

301
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,292
You okay?

302
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:48,987
No.

303
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,329
What's the matter?

304
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:53,332
Will, um...

305
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,799
- I think we need a break.
- Oh, Christ.

306
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:09,381
W... I... I... uh, is it the work?

307
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,878
I mean I know
I've not been around so much,

308
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:13,781
but at least I'm almost finished
with this stuff.

309
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:14,482
I told you
there's gonna be a few...

310
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:15,849
I know, I know. Uh...

311
00:20:15,884 --> 00:20:17,290
I understand.

312
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:22,427
It's just...
I don't actually know what it is

313
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,161
and that's the problem.

314
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:24,924
I can't fix what I don't know...

315
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,464
Well, that's fucking great,
isn't it?

316
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:27,828
So, you don't know what's wrong.

317
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:29,698
You don't communicate to me
what's wrong. Is it...

318
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,304
I'm trying to communicate
to you right now

319
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,305
and is this how
you're gonna behave?

320
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,172
Yeah, yeah, well,
what is it this time, Lisa?

321
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,033
- Your depression?
- I'm not depressed.

322
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,607
Uh, you're unfulfilled again,
because we know what happens

323
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:38,773
when you're unfulfilled.

324
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:41,479
We've been there,
I dealt with that.

325
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:42,513
But that's not enough.

326
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:50,818
- I'm sorry.
- D... No, it's...

327
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,952
I'm sorry, I'm sorry that...
Uh. I'm sorry.

328
00:20:55,594 --> 00:21:01,026
I don't feel anything anymore.

329
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,599
It's like I'm just numb.

330
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:03,897
That's the worst part of it.

331
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,768
I can't even pinpoint why

332
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:09,771
and I think some time apart
would be really beneficial.

333
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:13,412
Get some clarity, some space.

334
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:32,728
- Detective Paterson.
- Mr. Spann?

335
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:34,499
- Yeah.
- All right.

336
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,601
- Any uh, news about your wife?
- No.

337
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,801
It's...
It's an hour and a half now.

338
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:41,506
I... I haven't seen her.

339
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,376
I... I went to her parents' house
in Emerson

340
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:45,411
and she didn't
show up there either.

341
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,907
Why would you go there?

342
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:47,908
Well,
that's where I was takin' her.

343
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:50,108
I thought maybe she...
She would go by there.

344
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,846
But we asked you to stay here,

345
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,979
'cause she could have
come back here.

346
00:21:53,014 --> 00:21:53,980
Look,
I'm clutchin' the straws here.

347
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,521
I... I don't really know
what the protocol is

348
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:57,885
for a missing wife.

349
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,458
So yeah, I took action
and I went lookin' for her.

350
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:00,525
- All right, uh...
- I don't know what the...

351
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,461
What are her parents' names?

352
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,958
Uh, Anna and Barry Adams.

353
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,795
Oh, the Adams.
I know the Adams a little bit.

354
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,665
Good people.

355
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,666
Yeah, the good people, yeah.

356
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,735
Did she um, leave behind
any personal belongings?

357
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,000
- A purse?
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,936
- I found her purse in the car.
- Okay.

359
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,975
And I have her computer as well.

360
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,976
Okay, well, hold on to that.

361
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,110
Let me just look at this.

362
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:26,144
You have her phone, do you, huh?

363
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,684
No, I think she had her phone.

364
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:30,489
I... I... I tried Find My Phone,
but it must be off.

365
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,788
All right. Let's head inside.

366
00:22:37,498 --> 00:22:38,827
Oscar.

367
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:39,993
Detective.

368
00:22:40,028 --> 00:22:41,159
Uh, what you need? Coffee?

369
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,128
No, no, I need the uh,
camera footage

370
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:44,866
from the surveillance.

371
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:46,769
Uh, the camera's been busted
a couple weeks.

372
00:22:46,804 --> 00:22:47,603
I got a guy comin' out,

373
00:22:47,638 --> 00:22:49,002
but they keep sayin'
they comin' out.

374
00:22:49,037 --> 00:22:50,443
Nobody showed up yet.

375
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:52,203
Well, this man says
his wife is missing.

376
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,743
You've been sitting here
all day.

377
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:55,712
- Did you see anybody?
- I... I didn't seen a thing.

378
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:58,484
Shoot. All right, listen,
I'ma head back to the station,

379
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:00,079
- issue out an APB.
- Yeah.

380
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:01,883
You wanna come with me?
I can take a full statement.

381
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:06,591
No, I think I...
I'm gonna stay here.

382
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,791
- Just in case she shows up.
- All right.

383
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:11,629
You mind if I... computer.

384
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:12,630
Do you know what's the code?

385
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:16,161
No, I... I...
She didn't give it to me.

386
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:17,569
Uh, don't worry.

387
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,933
I got one of them whizz kids
down there.

388
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,473
He can crack anything.

389
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:29,614
So what I just...
Do I still hang out front?

390
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:32,078
Yeah, like I said,
just be reachable.

391
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,651
Okay.

392
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:35,114
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

393
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:38,881
Hey, Oscar, yeah?

394
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:40,652
- Uh, back again, huh?
- Yeah.

395
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:47,153
Um, you said the camera's
not workin'.

396
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:48,891
Yeah, I already told you,
it's fuckin' busted.

397
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:50,255
Yeah, you said it to
me, you said it to the detective.

398
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,631
- It's 'cause it's busted.
- Right.

399
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,600
See, I know a thing
about these uh, cameras.

400
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:58,736
I've worked quite a few
and uh, that's live.

401
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:00,804
It's workin'.

402
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,103
No, it must... uh,
maybe there's a battery in there

403
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:04,302
- or something...
- What are you playin' on?

404
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,470
What are you talking about?

405
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,646
What are you playin'
on? What's goin' on here?

406
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:09,010
Buddy, I got no video here,
okay?

407
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:09,911
Yeah, you got no screen.

408
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:10,945
Yeah, what do you want from me?

409
00:25:10,981 --> 00:25:13,344
You might have no feed,
but that's recording.

410
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,016
Uh, we mind
our own fuckin' business here,

411
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:16,314
all right, man?

412
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,048
Did you say you mind
your own fuckin' business?

413
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,182
Yeah, get the fuck out of here.

414
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:19,856
We're talkin'
about my fuckin' wife here.

415
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:20,990
- Well, not my problem.
- Uh, really?

416
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:21,457
- That's how you're gonna be?
- Not my problem.

417
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:22,559
Get the fuck out.

418
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:23,393
Okay, I'm gonna need to look
at this footage, man.

419
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:25,258
Hey.
Hey, what the fuck you doin'?

420
00:25:25,294 --> 00:25:26,460
You won't mind if I hav a look.

421
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:27,060
- Hey, nobody back here.
- You won't have a problem.

422
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:28,194
Get the f... hey!

423
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,098
Get the fuck...

424
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:33,771
Filthy, little motherfucker.

425
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:35,300
What the fuck
are you playin' at?

426
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:39,172
Listen! What the...

427
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:41,075
What's the fuckin' matter
with you?

428
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,814
- You run the fuckin' place!
- I'm kidding. Man, okay, okay!

429
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:45,849
- It's right there.
- Thank you!

430
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,893
Piece of shit.

431
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,264
Fuck!

432
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,775
What the fuck is going on here?

433
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,017
Hi there.

434
00:26:22,052 --> 00:26:24,349
Um, I'm here to see uh,
Detective Paterson.

435
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,889
Paterson.

436
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:27,286
Yo.

437
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,354
We got uh, Mr. Spann here.

438
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:30,993
- Hey.
- Hey.

439
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:32,830
He's got the CCTV.

440
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:34,293
I thought it was broken.

441
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:37,197
Yeah, so did I.

442
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:38,671
Oscar gave it to me.

443
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:40,101
That damn Oscar.

444
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:41,036
Let's go plug it in.

445
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:46,074
Hey, Mike! Heads up, incoming.

446
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:54,819
One second.

447
00:26:56,757 --> 00:26:58,724
Your man Oscar is connected
with this, by the way.

448
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,693
-Okay. All right
-I'm just...

449
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:03,729
I took it out around 11:30,
so you gotta go back

450
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:06,424
to like 10 or 9:55 or something.

451
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:13,871
Back more, just go...
Go back some more.

452
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:14,839
- Back up a little bit.
- Got it.

453
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:16,676
Back up a little bit.
A couple of minutes.

454
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,042
So, that... would... that's it?

455
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:22,044
No, no. That's... that's not her.

456
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,441
No, you gotta go...
Go back some more.

457
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,380
There she... there...
That's her comin' out.

458
00:27:42,198 --> 00:27:44,363
All right, who's that man?

459
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:47,069
I don't...
I don't know who that is.

460
00:27:47,104 --> 00:27:49,203
I... I...

461
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:51,843
He seems to
know who your wife is.

462
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,174
I've never seen him in my life.

463
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,756
Oh, this fuckin' truck.

464
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:07,155
Well...

465
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,992
Come on. Come on, move it.

466
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:16,769
Okay, wait, wait, he... he...
He has her.

467
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:17,837
He's have to taken her.

468
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:18,804
- All right, all right.
- That's... that's your man.

469
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,070
We'll have some guys
look into it, all right?

470
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:22,302
- Anderson, why don't you go...
- Can you go back in on him?

471
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:23,776
Track down Oscar, all right?

472
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:24,643
Yeah.

473
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:25,478
I bet he knows who this guy is.

474
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,373
- Thank you.
- All right, thank you.

475
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:28,847
All right, in the meantime,

476
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:29,714
you mind
if we go in another room,

477
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,377
I ask you a few questions
in private?

478
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:32,477
- Yeah, sure, let's do it.
- All right.

479
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:37,856
Follow me.

480
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,522
Come on in, have a seat.

481
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:54,499
<i>Uh, some water?</i>

482
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:55,566
<i>Coffee or anything?</i>

483
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,909
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

484
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:02,111
So, you sure you don't know
who that man is?

485
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:04,542
No, I've never seen him before
in my life. Uh, no.

486
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,049
Okay, no, it's... it's okay.

487
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:09,250
I mean he just seemed
to uh, have a...

488
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:10,581
Be pretty familiar
with your wife.

489
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,583
- Th... that's all.
- I don't know.

490
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:15,322
I mean uh, doesn't look
like the kinda person

491
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:16,521
that Lisa would be friends with.

492
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,094
- Okay.
- I... I know her pretty well.

493
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:19,458
All right.

494
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,031
So Lisa's from her,
she's got friends from here.

495
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:22,329
Do you...
Do you know any of them?

496
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:26,366
No, I don't really know
any of her friends.

497
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:29,171
She... she didn't really talk
about her high school.

498
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:32,207
That's unusual.

499
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:37,883
So you were um, on your way
to Lisa's folks' house, right?

500
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:40,314
Uh, Adams, in Emerson?

501
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:42,118
Yeah. Like I said,
I was takin' her there

502
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:43,482
to drop her off, yeah.

503
00:29:45,156 --> 00:29:48,520
You know, I... I
have to ask you um...

504
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:50,027
how's your marriage?

505
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:55,164
Where are we going with this?
I don't... I don't...

506
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:10,179
We... we... we were...

507
00:30:10,214 --> 00:30:13,083
We're going
through a rough time.

508
00:30:13,118 --> 00:30:15,217
Oh, so it was gonna be a...
A separation?

509
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:16,581
No, it's not a separation.

510
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,155
She just said she needed
a bit of a break, that's all.

511
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,156
So not a divorce?

512
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:24,061
No, not... I don't get
the relevance of this.

513
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,396
Do you and your wife um...

514
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,938
- You guys fight?
- No.

515
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,073
No, there's just been
some tension.

516
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:40,407
We don't fight, we don't scream,
we don't shout.

517
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:41,375
So did you have a fight
on the way here?

518
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,410
No, we did not have a fight
in the way here.

519
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:46,611
Okay.

520
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:53,959
So, you told me that your wife
may have walked home from the...

521
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:55,653
From the station, right?

522
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,061
I mean so why would she...

523
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:59,591
I didn't know, detec...
I didn't know.

524
00:30:59,626 --> 00:31:00,658
Why do you think
she would go there without you?

525
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,066
That mean if she did,

526
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:03,331
it would imply
maybe you had an argument.

527
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:05,531
Yeah, it was a mistake,
it didn't make sense.

528
00:31:05,566 --> 00:31:07,335
I didn't know what to do.

529
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,403
But she... why would she do that
if you guys didn't have a fight?

530
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:10,173
You know, I mean we always
can get a little hot,

531
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,174
heated in the car.

532
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,472
Why are we wasting time here?

533
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:15,211
Like just...

534
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:18,984
Look, there's been some tension.

535
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,583
- My wife's an amazing woman.
- Okay.

536
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:27,388
- Best woman I ever met.
- Mm hmm.

537
00:31:27,423 --> 00:31:28,653
But she has
a darkness inside her

538
00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:30,028
and sometimes...

539
00:31:32,461 --> 00:31:34,032
...she withdraws. I don't know.

540
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:36,397
She's been there for me
through a lot of stuff and...

541
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:41,171
now she's
goin' through some stuff.

542
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:42,700
I'm just tryin'
to be there for her.

543
00:31:44,275 --> 00:31:46,308
Okay.

544
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,474
Where do you live, Will?

545
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:51,610
I live in Manchester,
New Hampshire.

546
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,416
And what do you do for a living?

547
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:00,454
I'm a real estate developer.

548
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,996
There's lots of money
in real estate, right?

549
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,462
- Lots of cash exchanges hands.
- Yeah.

550
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,167
A lot of unsavory characters.

551
00:32:10,202 --> 00:32:12,367
Yeah, there's some,
but not at a gas station

552
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:14,369
in Emerson.

553
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:17,108
Disgruntled employees sometimes.

554
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,143
- Disgruntled employees.
- No. I...

555
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:20,573
Just like you know,

556
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:21,673
they don't like the way
they've been treated,

557
00:32:21,708 --> 00:32:22,982
the way they've been paid.

558
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:29,054
I'm a good boss, okay?

559
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:32,585
I really don't see how
that going on in Manchester

560
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,719
is gonna have
any fucking bearing

561
00:32:34,754 --> 00:32:36,127
in what is happening here in...

562
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,689
You uh,
do a lot of work on the road?

563
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:41,198
You go some prospecting,
so to speak, speculating?

564
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,662
Looking at property,
lookin' at land?

565
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:45,334
Takes you away from the city
a little bit?

566
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:48,106
No, I don't leave so much.

567
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:49,536
I work a lot,
I'm away from the house a lot.

568
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,537
Work a lot...
Away from the house.

569
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:52,011
But I don't
leave town so much. No.

570
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:55,410
All right, so now it's... what?

571
00:32:55,445 --> 00:32:56,774
- No, no, no.
- What? What?

572
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:00,613
Have you ever had an affair?

573
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:05,783
There's two guys
in here talkin', right?

574
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,650
We all... we all... every...

575
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:09,094
Every guy has a wandering eye,
right?

576
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,302
No, I haven't had an affair.

577
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:20,435
Has your wife?

578
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:27,673
Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,514
How long ago was that?

580
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,815
Uh, it was about...

581
00:33:40,457 --> 00:33:41,720
six months ago.

582
00:33:44,395 --> 00:33:45,724
Do you have life insurance
on your wife?

583
00:33:50,368 --> 00:33:51,598
Yeah.

584
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,864
How much?

585
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,338
I don't know.

586
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:56,372
A couple million.

587
00:33:58,607 --> 00:34:00,541
The standard, right?

588
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,609
Well, no, I mean I...
I don't know.

589
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:03,709
I make cop money,
I don't make development money.

590
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:07,416
Okay, so I've abducted my wife
and I'm gonna kill her.

591
00:34:07,451 --> 00:34:09,451
I... I'm gonna cash out
in a huge insurance policy.

592
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:10,551
That's what this is all about?

593
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:11,218
Well, okay,
that's what's happening.

594
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:12,386
I gotta cover all the bases.

595
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:15,325
No, my wife, right now, could be
three fucking states away

596
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,722
and you're sitting in here
askin' me

597
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:19,560
ben-fuckin'-ign questions

598
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:22,497
that I've got nothing to do
with what has happened to her!

599
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:24,598
Something drastic
has to happen here, Detective.

600
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,138
I need your fucking help.

601
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:27,733
Or should I just go
and do it myself?

602
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:32,408
Why would I bring you
the evidence?

603
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,741
You might be clever
than most people.

604
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,282
- I don't know.
- Oh, Christ.

605
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,778
- You're a smart man.
- Yeah.

606
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:42,187
Developer. Make a lot of money.

607
00:34:42,222 --> 00:34:43,650
Am I free to go?

608
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:45,916
Anytime you want.

609
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,720
We have your name,
we have your number,

610
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:49,557
we'll be in touch.

611
00:34:49,592 --> 00:34:50,358
Do you have a photo
of your wife?

612
00:34:50,393 --> 00:34:51,823
Yeah, I have a photo of my wife.

613
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:00,766
Okay, be right back.

614
00:35:31,469 --> 00:35:33,964
I mean
he looks suspicious as hell, right?

615
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,306
He seems
like a little wild card.

616
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,340
I don't know.

617
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,308
Mm hmm.

618
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:52,818
<i>Morning, sleepyhead.</i>

619
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,261
- What are you makin'?
- Well...

620
00:35:56,296 --> 00:35:57,856
Are you trying
to make breakfast?

621
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:02,234
<i>Guess what I just got.</i>

622
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,400
What?

623
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:05,402
Remember Nate's contract
that I was up for?

624
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:06,436
- Yeah.
- The meeting I had.

625
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:07,932
Mm hmm.

626
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,439
I got the God job!

627
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:10,803
- No, you didn't!
- I did!

628
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:12,244
Oh, my God!

629
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,547
We got so much goin' for it.

630
00:36:18,582 --> 00:36:20,252
You just gotta look uh...
Look, look, what we have!

631
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:21,385
We have a beautiful life.

632
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,716
I know we've been through shit,
but...

633
00:36:24,324 --> 00:36:25,554
we worked hard for this.

634
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:29,294
I mean... we've got
some more gas in the tank.

635
00:36:53,518 --> 00:36:55,815
- Barry. Anna.
- Yeah, we're in here.

636
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,816
You guys hear anything?

637
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:58,719
- Yes, no.
- Yeah, yeah, right, no.

638
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,523
- You?
- Uh, the cops put out an APB.

639
00:37:00,558 --> 00:37:03,295
- Okay, I knew that.
- Okay.

640
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,626
All right, so listen,
I found something.

641
00:37:04,661 --> 00:37:05,990
- I wanna show you guys.
- Yeah.

642
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:09,466
We got it off that CCTV camera.

643
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:10,797
Okay, you know this guy?

644
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:12,469
I can't really
see very well from here.

645
00:37:12,504 --> 00:37:14,471
Anna, do you see...
I can't see without my glasses.

646
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:15,868
- Hold on.
- Um...

647
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:16,869
- You know him?
- That's hard to tell from here,

648
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,376
but it looks a little bit like...

649
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:19,509
- Oh yeah, that's Knuckles.
- A bit like...

650
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:20,972
- Yeah. He...
- That... that's Knuckles.

651
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:22,006
That's our handyman.

652
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:23,274
- He's done some work around.
- He works for you?

653
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,647
- No, he work... does odd jobs.
- This guy looks like a creep.

654
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:26,945
He's a friend of Lisa's.

655
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,584
I mean they've known each other
since school.

656
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:29,518
It's none... and he...

657
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:30,786
I wouldn't call him
a friend of Lisa's.

658
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:32,753
- They knew each other when...
- Alright, g... guys, okay, okay.

659
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:35,019
So just...
Does she know him enough

660
00:37:35,054 --> 00:37:36,427
to get in a car with him?

661
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,958
I don't know.

662
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:41,597
And do you think this guy
would do her any harm?

663
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:46,536
Wait a minute. Can I see this?

664
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,504
- Is that his car?
- Yeah, it's his car. Yeah.

665
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,099
- I've seen this car.
- Really? I don't know.

666
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:50,233
- Where did you see it?
- Yes. I did.

667
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,674
I saw... I saw it when I went up
to um, Archer Grove

668
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:53,873
- for the... the garage ser...
- Morrison?

669
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:54,775
- Yes!
- Really?

670
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,974
It was in the back.

671
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:56,741
- All right.
- Uh, in the hangar things.

672
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:57,709
Okay, good, good, good.

673
00:37:57,744 --> 00:37:58,944
Good, now is...
Where's Morrison's, tell me.

674
00:37:58,979 --> 00:37:59,945
It was right... right there.

675
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,019
Right, but so where...
Anna, just where is...

676
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:02,553
I was at the light bridge,
I stopped.

677
00:38:02,588 --> 00:38:03,916
Where is Morrison's?

678
00:38:18,603 --> 00:38:19,269
Paterson.

679
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:21,703
Hey uh, detective, it's Will.

680
00:38:21,738 --> 00:38:23,507
I'm just checkin' in.

681
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:25,575
See if you heard anything,
seen anything?

682
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,910
Not yet, but we're on it.

683
00:38:26,945 --> 00:38:29,612
<i>Okay. All
right. Well, let me know if you do.</i>

684
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:31,042
Of course.

685
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:34,419
Oh, by the way,
I just wanna say sorry

686
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:37,147
about before you know,
bein' sharp.

687
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,886
<i>You're just doing your job,
I get it.</i>

688
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:42,592
I... I appreciate that.
So, what are you up to now?

689
00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:45,463
Oh, I'm just kinda
drivin' in circles

690
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:48,895
around the edge of town,
gettin' nowhere.

691
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,733
All right, well, um,
she turns up, give us a call.

692
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,130
Yeah.

693
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,033
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear anything.

694
00:38:57,741 --> 00:38:59,411
Same here. Bye.

695
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:05,043
<i>In 12 miles take
Exit 38 towards Archer Road.</i>

696
00:39:05,078 --> 00:39:06,110
Morrison's.

697
00:39:19,928 --> 00:39:23,699
<i>In 200 feet,
your destination is on the left.</i>

698
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,135
<i>Arrived.</i>

699
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:14,579
What the fuck.

700
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,158
Come on!

701
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:38,570
You fucking come on.

702
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:13,231
Hey.

703
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:16,300
What the fuck?

704
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:19,039
You know who I am?
Where is she?

705
00:42:19,074 --> 00:42:20,876
Okay, look, uh, li... listen,

Hey, where the fuck is she?
Don't push me!

707
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:23,747
I don't know... I don't know
who you're talkin' about.

708
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:24,648
- Who?

709
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:25,515
- She who?

710
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:27,751
My wife Lisa!
You know where she is.

711
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:29,280
- Listen, you fucking calm down.
- Tell me.

712
00:42:29,315 --> 00:42:31,084
- Where the fuck is she?
- You fucking calm down.

713
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,756
- You calm down, just...
- Stay back, stay back.

714
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:33,757
Just stay the fuck back.

715
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:36,023
You're the one

716
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:37,860
- Come on.
- Stop!

717
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:38,993

Okay, stop! Stop, stop!

719
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:43,063
I swear to God
I'll smash your fucking skull!

720
00:42:43,098 --> 00:42:44,295
Where the fuck is she?

721
00:43:04,823 --> 00:43:05,888
Okay.

722
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:13,060
Oh!

Fuckin' talk to me!

724
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:16,734
I didn't wanna leave her
with Frank.

725
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:19,429
Right? He made me...

726
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:20,738
Who's Frank?

727
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:23,774
Tell me, you fuckin' prick.

728
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,273
Stop, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

729
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:06,344
Stop. Oh, stop!

730
00:44:15,993 --> 00:44:17,894
I'll get you to Frank.

731
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:21,095
She said she had a trailer.

732
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,767
Where they sell.

733
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:25,495
She's with Frank.

734
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,805
I'll take you. I'll take you.

735
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,973
Please, stop. Stop, stop.

736
00:45:11,378 --> 00:45:13,213
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Come here, you piece of shit.

737
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:18,416

738
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:20,253
I'll take you...

739
00:45:25,095 --> 00:45:27,062
I didn't wanna leave her.

740
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,965
They made me leave her.

741
00:45:31,134 --> 00:45:34,267
Okay, I'll go.

742
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:37,402
Just sto... just hold it. No.

743
00:45:39,142 --> 00:45:42,440
Okay, okay. Uh, okay.

744
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:10,039
Oscar!

745
00:46:14,243 --> 00:46:15,374
Where's Oscar?

746
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,046
He worked earlier today.

747
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:20,016
Well, listen, you tell him
he can call me at the station,

748
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:21,611
come down see me at the station,
write me at the station,

749
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:23,547
but he better come find me.

750
00:46:23,582 --> 00:46:25,582
If not, I'm comin' back
and I'm closing the place up.

751
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:26,550
You understand?

752
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:48,847
Shit.

753
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:04,390
Just shut up, okay?

754
00:47:06,163 --> 00:47:08,064
Or you and I'll both be in jail.

755
00:47:24,577 --> 00:47:26,049
How you doin' today, sir?

756
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,347
Good.

757
00:47:27,382 --> 00:47:29,151
You know why I stopped you?

758
00:47:29,186 --> 00:47:31,923
Yeah, I know I was...
I was speeding.

759
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:35,421
A little fast. 82 on a 55.

760
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:37,093
I get your license
and registration?

761
00:47:37,128 --> 00:47:40,195
Yeah, I was just in a bit of a...
You know, family emergency.

762
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:44,661
Here you go.

763
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:46,069
My... uh.

00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:50,469
That's my...

765
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,111
You don't live around here?

766
00:47:55,146 --> 00:47:57,146
- No, I live in Manchester.
- Mm hmm.

767
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,347
You had some trouble today?

768
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,088
Oh. That was uh...

769
00:48:05,123 --> 00:48:07,354
I was uh, j... just
choppin' wood up at the cabin.

770
00:48:10,656 --> 00:48:11,930
I'll be right back.

771
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:23,337
Shh! Fuck!

772
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:45,392
Would you mind steppin'
out of the vehicle please?

773
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,693
Why, officer?
It's just a traffic violation.

774
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:51,398
Hey, just step
out of the vehicle for a minute.

775
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:54,368
We'll get this over with

776
00:48:54,403 --> 00:48:55,600
Sure. Yeah.

777
00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:03,178
Thank you.

778
00:49:03,214 --> 00:49:04,642
- Can you just uh...

779
00:49:04,677 --> 00:49:07,018
- Give me a ticket?
- No.

780
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:08,580
- I'm uh...
- You just step over there.

781
00:49:20,198 --> 00:49:22,528
Whose bags are these?

782
00:49:22,563 --> 00:49:23,595
My wife's.

783
00:49:26,204 --> 00:49:27,335
That's a lot of bags.

784
00:49:29,372 --> 00:49:31,339
Yeah, she likes her clothes.

785
00:49:33,541 --> 00:49:34,705
Where's your wife?

786
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,080
Manchester.

787
00:49:55,629 --> 00:49:57,233
Do you mind poppin' the trunk

788
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:00,269
Sure.

789
00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:07,573
Hey, stop! Stop right there!

790
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,579
Dispatch, this is 5-7.

791
00:50:13,614 --> 00:50:15,680
I need a 20. Repeat, the 20.

792
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,835
Detective?

793
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,836
Yeah.

794
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,609
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

795
00:50:43,644 --> 00:50:45,413
Thanks.

796
00:50:45,448 --> 00:50:46,843
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

797
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,251
I appreciate you guys
takin' the time.

798
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:50,220
I just have to ask you
a few questions.

799
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,320
Absolutely.

800
00:50:51,355 --> 00:50:52,717
Do you know a guy named "Clint"?

801
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:58,129
Um, yeah,
it was the man Lisa was seeing.

802
00:50:58,164 --> 00:51:00,131
It was... it was briefly.

803
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,165
- Yeah.
- It was like months ago.

804
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,167
Yeah, that's what I figured.

805
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:06,401
Um, do you think your son-in-law
was straying?

806
00:51:06,436 --> 00:51:07,567
No.

807
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:09,338
No, that comes straight
from Lisa.

808
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:11,472
He had nothing to do with that.

809
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:38,468
We bypassed her password

810
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:41,469
and we saw the last three emails
came from this Clint guy.

811
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:43,240
- Right.
- He kept asking to see her.

812
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:44,835
And did she answer his emails?

813
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,837
Not once.

814
00:51:46,872 --> 00:51:49,444
Are you still seeing Clint?

815
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:50,709
Lisa:
No.

816
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:52,249
No, that was one night.

817
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:54,912
I'm... I'm alone, mom,

818
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,650
and that is exactly what I want
for the time being.

819
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:10,894
Yeah, you mean...

820
00:52:13,404 --> 00:52:14,203
You wanna be able to do

821
00:52:14,238 --> 00:52:17,208
what you wanna be able
to do again.

822
00:52:17,243 --> 00:52:21,542
So you have your break,
you have your fun,

823
00:52:21,577 --> 00:52:22,708
and I'll just go with it.

824
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:26,547
He must be mad at you.

825
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:27,911
He's not really the type
to get mad

826
00:52:27,946 --> 00:52:28,845
and you know that.

827
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:31,255
Sweetheart,
I'm sorry I don't buy that.

828
00:52:34,392 --> 00:52:36,788
Fuck. Fuck!

829
00:52:49,275 --> 00:52:51,869
We contacted Boston PD,
that's where Clint lives now,

830
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:53,904
and uh, we had some...
Some tech people

831
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:56,511
search all of his electronics
to see if he had hired anyone.

832
00:52:56,546 --> 00:53:00,746
They did a thorough search
and it came up unsuccessful.

833
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:03,881
Now um, Knuckles knew
what Lisa looked like,

834
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:05,817
because he saw the...
The pictures in your place.

835
00:53:05,852 --> 00:53:07,258
Is that right?

836
00:53:07,293 --> 00:53:08,490
Well, I mean he knew her
when they were kids,

837
00:53:08,525 --> 00:53:09,953
- they went to school together.
- Right.

838
00:53:09,988 --> 00:53:11,955
Okay.

839
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,528
And you said
you saw Knuckles' car

840
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:14,529
at the Morrison's, right?

841
00:53:14,564 --> 00:53:15,794
Yes, I drove by there
a couple of weeks ago

842
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:17,334
and I saw it there.

843
00:53:17,369 --> 00:53:18,929
And then I... I do remember
seeing it another time.

844
00:53:18,964 --> 00:53:22,273
I just... I don't recall exactly
when that was.

845
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:24,506
Doesn't matter,
I was there an hour ago.

846
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,837
- And?
- And?

847
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:27,575
His trailer's empty.

848
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:30,677
Well, can you send a chopper,
survey the area?

849
00:53:30,712 --> 00:53:33,042
I mean they... you can't let them
disappear like that.

850
00:53:33,077 --> 00:53:34,549
There's a suspect on the run.

851
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:35,781
No, there is not.

852
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:37,585
No, no, you...
Well, how do you mean?

853
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,356
Well, suspect of what?

854
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:41,523
In all logic,
Lisa should be here now.

855
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:43,393
She is not.

856
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,691
That is all we know
at this junction.

857
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:47,430
That, and she bumped
into your trusted handyman

858
00:53:47,465 --> 00:53:48,761
at the gas station.

859
00:53:48,796 --> 00:53:50,334
Technically, there's no crime.

860
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:47,754
Hey!

861
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:50,955
You lookin' to get shot?

862
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,091
No.

863
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:56,598
Then why the fuck
you touchin' it?

864
00:54:59,064 --> 00:55:01,636
I don't know...
I just uh, thought...

865
00:55:01,671 --> 00:55:02,802
I don't know.

866
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:03,869
What are you doin' here?

867
00:55:05,576 --> 00:55:08,940
I'm
lookin' for uh, lookin' for Frank.

868
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:10,513
Frank?

869
00:55:10,548 --> 00:55:11,613
Yeah, Frank.

870
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:13,648
Who sent you?

871
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:15,782
Frank's a friend of mine.
I know him from Knuckles.

872
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:17,916
Knuckles.

873
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,390
How do you Knuckles?

874
00:55:19,425 --> 00:55:20,820
Does it fuckin' matter?

875
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,624
I'm askin' a question.
Yeah, it fuckin' matters.

876
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:25,154
Well, he's a friend of mine.
He works for my family.

877
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,021
He introduced me to Frank.

878
00:55:26,057 --> 00:55:29,026
I'm here to do some business
with him.

879
00:55:29,061 --> 00:55:30,698
All right?

880
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,469
Where you coming from?

881
00:55:33,868 --> 00:55:36,440
Coming from Emerson.

882
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:37,573
Fuck you.

883
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,512
Where's your car?

884
00:55:43,713 --> 00:55:44,811
Dude, it's crazy.

885
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:46,879
My car broke down
like a couple of miles

886
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:49,717
back down the road,
so I'm fuckin' late.

887
00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:50,518
You walkin' through those woods?

888
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:51,620
Yeah, I'm walkin'
through the woods

889
00:55:51,655 --> 00:55:52,786
and Frank's waitin' for me.

890
00:55:52,821 --> 00:55:55,855
So, you wanna
let me get on my way?

891
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,186
Frank didn't tell me anyone's
comin' this way.

892
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:58,759
Well,
'cause Frank didn't fuckin' know

893
00:55:58,794 --> 00:55:59,958
I'd be runnin'
through the fuckin' woods.

894
00:55:59,993 --> 00:56:01,564
I'm supposed to be
drivin' there.

895
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,029
Calm down, give me a second.

896
00:56:06,868 --> 00:56:07,801
Hey, Frank.

897
00:56:12,643 --> 00:56:13,708
Frank, you copy?

898
00:56:18,176 --> 00:56:19,615
You say your car broke down?

899
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:22,178
Yeah, a couple of miles of back.

900
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,146
Gave me a workout.

901
00:56:23,181 --> 00:56:25,555
Yeah, no fucking kidding.

902
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,216
Frank, you copy?

903
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:28,657
You know what?

904
00:56:28,692 --> 00:56:31,594
Can we stop
fuckin' wasting time, eh?

905
00:56:31,629 --> 00:56:33,024
- You want...
- Hey.

906
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,730
I'm just doin' my fucking job.

907
00:56:35,765 --> 00:56:37,666
Fuck's sake, man.

908
00:56:37,701 --> 00:56:39,833
You know what? I'll fuckin' go.

909
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:41,472
The phone
not gonna work out here.

910
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:44,134
Oh, fuck. I can't believe it.

911
00:56:44,169 --> 00:56:45,201
You don't think I would have
fuckin' called him?

912
00:56:45,236 --> 00:56:46,939
You know what?
Enough of this shit.

913
00:56:46,974 --> 00:56:48,479
How about the worst fucking day?

914
00:56:48,514 --> 00:56:51,207
Fucking car's broken down,
now you're stoppin' me.

915
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:53,011
Why don't you explain to Frank
why this didn't happen,

916
00:56:53,046 --> 00:56:54,485
all right?

917
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,585
Can't wait to see
what happens there.

918
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,784
I'm fuckin' out.

919
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:03,087
All right, hold the fuck up!

920
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:08,928
Keep walkin' down that way.

921
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:11,700
All right. Thanks.

922
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:15,902
You better not be fuckin' me.

923
00:57:28,147 --> 00:57:30,015
Fuck you, motherfucker!

924
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,984
- Uh, no.
- Cool down, hey!

925
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:32,820
- No.
- Fuck you, man.

926
00:57:32,855 --> 00:57:33,689
Get out of here.

927
00:57:33,724 --> 00:57:35,592
Oh, oh.

928
00:58:42,023 --> 00:58:43,660
Leave this.

929
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,727
Is the truck fixed yet?

930
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,926
Yeah, man, the truck's all good.

931
00:59:22,096 --> 00:59:23,667
Larry Barry.

932
00:59:23,702 --> 00:59:25,867
Hey, yo, get back to work.

933
00:59:25,902 --> 00:59:27,198
This is the second time
I asked you, man.

934
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,336
Fuck.

935
00:59:33,371 --> 00:59:36,042
And so he just
ran off into the woods?

936
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,308
<i>Yes, but we're
in the process of setting up a perimeter.</i>

937
00:59:38,343 --> 00:59:39,144
All right, thank you.

938
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:45,755
Sergeant!

939
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,021
What the...

940
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:55,181
Come, Oscar.

941
01:01:58,483 --> 01:01:59,922
Hey!

942
01:02:04,863 --> 01:02:06,060
Yo, Oscar.

943
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:14,530
Fuck.

944
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:46,562
...right back.

945
01:02:46,597 --> 01:02:47,497
All right, I'll be right back.

946
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,341
Hey, clean this shit up.

947
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:58,244
All right. Yeah, yeah,
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm...

948
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:09,920
Get in it.

949
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,303
Hey, man, I
told Robert about that.

950
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,053
- Give me a minute with him.
- Mm hmm.

951
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:27,261
Pete Daniels.

952
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:28,295
That's your real name?

953
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,565
- Unemployed?
- Fuck you, man.

954
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,501
I fuckin' worked. Just...

955
01:05:36,536 --> 01:05:37,469
Recently?

956
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:41,011
Yeah, I fuckin' worked recently.

957
01:05:41,046 --> 01:05:41,737
Where?

958
01:05:41,772 --> 01:05:43,541
Wherever fuckin' pays me, man.

959
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:46,577
Uh, you know, put up a fence,
pull a fuckin' post, demo work.

960
01:05:46,612 --> 01:05:50,746
And sometimes you kidnap women
and hold 'em for ransom, right?

961
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,088
Why are you fuckin'...

962
01:05:52,123 --> 01:05:53,716
Why are you grilling me
like this man?

963
01:05:53,751 --> 01:05:55,487
I'm the one that got attacked,
and tied up,

964
01:05:55,522 --> 01:05:57,357
and thrown in a fucking car!

965
01:05:57,392 --> 01:05:59,128
Why am I the fuckin' bad guy?

966
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:30,291
Here's what
I'm gonna do for you.

967
01:06:31,093 --> 01:06:33,558
You tell me where Lisa is
and I'll walk in the court

968
01:06:33,593 --> 01:06:36,792
and I'll tell them
how cooperative you've been.

969
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:39,300
I'll sing your praises
to the rooftops.

970
01:06:39,769 --> 01:06:42,138
And I bet
if Will gets his wife back

971
01:06:42,173 --> 01:06:43,337
and the Adams
get their daughter back,

972
01:06:43,372 --> 01:06:45,405
I can convince them
not to press charges.

973
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,308
Fuck you, man,
I ain't no stupid.

974
01:06:47,343 --> 01:06:49,178
I know
you can't promise me shit.

975
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:50,575
I'm just telling you
what I may be able to do

976
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:51,708
to help you out.

977
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:21,474
How did you get her
into your car?

978
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:26,116
Who said I fuckin' did, huh?

979
01:07:26,151 --> 01:07:27,183
You didn't?

980
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,355
I don't recall.

981
01:07:35,124 --> 01:07:38,194
You're on
footage talking to Lisa,

982
01:07:38,229 --> 01:07:39,327
but you forgot.

983
01:07:39,796 --> 01:07:41,494
Hey, uh, excuse me.

984
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:43,232
Lisa. Lisa Adams!

985
01:07:44,499 --> 01:07:46,466
- Pete, hi.
- Knuckles.

986
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,600
- Right, hi, how are you?
- I'm good. How're you?

987
01:07:48,635 --> 01:07:50,404
I know... I...
I heard you were coming back.

988
01:07:50,439 --> 01:07:52,208
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...
- Yeah.

989
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:55,607
I... I'm doin' some work uh, uh,
up at um, at... at your...

990
01:07:55,642 --> 01:07:57,609
Your parents' house on the room.

991
01:07:57,644 --> 01:07:59,281
- Oh, that's you! Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

992
01:07:59,316 --> 01:08:00,447
- They're so happy with it.
- Oh yeah.

993
01:08:00,482 --> 01:08:01,548
- I can't wait to see it.
- Good.

994
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:03,450
Are you... are you...
Are you headin' there right now?

995
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:04,484
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Are you?

996
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:05,683
Could you do me a favor?

997
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:07,619
Could you uh, bring an invoice
that I got?

998
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:09,390
Sure.

999
01:08:09,425 --> 01:08:09,957
Just a little
something, drop off for your pops.

1000
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:10,925
- Okay.
- Real quick.

1001
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,394
- Yeah, no problem.
- Who you here with?

1002
01:08:13,429 --> 01:08:14,593
- Oh, my husband.
- Oh.

1003
01:08:14,628 --> 01:08:15,427
Yeah.

1004
01:08:15,462 --> 01:08:16,760
You look really great,
by the way.

1005
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:17,627
- Thanks, thanks.
- Yeah.

1006
01:08:17,663 --> 01:08:19,499
You have to tell your mom
I said "hi."

1007
01:08:19,534 --> 01:08:21,237
I haven't seen her for uh...
Shut the fuck up.

1008
01:08:21,272 --> 01:08:22,832
Get in the fuckin' car.

1009
01:08:22,867 --> 01:08:25,736
Don't be stupid, just get in.
Get in the fuckin' car.

1010
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,679
You're on tape talking to her

1011
01:08:34,714 --> 01:08:35,911
right before she disappeared

1012
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:37,682
and no one's seen her alive
since.

1013
01:08:37,717 --> 01:08:39,321
Yeah,
so I fuckin' talked to her, man.

1014
01:08:39,356 --> 01:08:41,653
Big fuckin' deal, all right?
I knew her.

1015
01:08:41,688 --> 01:08:43,358
I was workin'
at her fuckin' parents' house.

1016
01:09:25,996 --> 01:09:28,238
- You just keep an eye on him.
- Damn, man.

1017
01:09:28,273 --> 01:09:30,240
Close to maybe two days,
I gotta fix the shit.

1018
01:10:05,805 --> 01:10:07,607
I think it's inside the kitchen.

1019
01:10:07,642 --> 01:10:10,038
Inside. You got the key?

1020
01:10:10,073 --> 01:10:11,006
I don't have the key, man.

1021
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,415
Shit.

1022
01:10:14,518 --> 01:10:15,714
Okay, I'll go back
to the house and get the key.

1023
01:10:15,749 --> 01:10:17,551
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh, shit.

1024
01:10:17,586 --> 01:10:18,418
- The hell, man?
- Watch your hands.

1025
01:10:18,454 --> 01:10:20,422
- Watch your hands.
- All right.

1026
01:10:20,757 --> 01:10:21,786
- Back up.
- Yeah, calm down, man.

1027
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:22,721
- Back up.
- Whoa, whoa!

1028
01:10:22,756 --> 01:10:23,755
- Hey.
- What the fuck?

1029
01:10:24,758 --> 01:10:26,593
Just tell me where she is, okay?

1030
01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:29,563
- Where who is?
- My wife. Lisa!

1031
01:10:29,598 --> 01:10:31,334
Tell me where Lisa is.

1032
01:10:31,703 --> 01:10:32,863
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about.

1033
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:35,030
Calm down, man. Be easy.

1034
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:38,539
Please, please.
Tell me, all right?

1035
01:10:39,475 --> 01:10:40,674
I don't care what you guys
are doin' here,

1036
01:10:40,709 --> 01:10:44,512
I just wanna know where she is
and I will get out of here.

1037
01:10:44,547 --> 01:10:45,777
No police, no nothing,

1038
01:10:45,812 --> 01:10:46,976
but just tell me
where she fuckin' is!

1039
01:10:47,011 --> 01:10:48,417
Know what we do here?
We don't have...

1040
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:51,013
So, please tell me.
I just want my wife back.

1041
01:10:51,048 --> 01:10:53,488
- Just put the gun down, bro.
- Knuckles told me!

1042
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:56,051
I know who you are!
Please.

1043
01:10:56,086 --> 01:10:58,394
Please just tell me
where she is.

1044
01:10:58,429 --> 01:10:59,857
I don't know any Knuckles, man.

1045
01:11:01,564 --> 01:11:02,860
Fuck.

1046
01:11:02,895 --> 01:11:04,961
Okay, open that door,
let me see what's inside.

1047
01:11:04,996 --> 01:11:06,765
- You wanna see what's in here?
- I swear to God,

1048
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,339
I will shoot you
in the fuckin' face.

1049
01:11:09,374 --> 01:11:10,439
All right.

1050
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:12,672
Open the door, Larry.

1051
01:11:12,707 --> 01:11:14,476
All right, calm down, man.

1052
01:11:14,511 --> 01:11:16,577
All right. Let
me see what's in there.

1053
01:11:16,612 --> 01:11:18,381
- Easy with that, man.
- Open the door.

1054
01:11:18,416 --> 01:11:19,679
Let him take a look.

1055
01:11:21,617 --> 01:11:22,748
Okay.

1056
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,491
- Good, man.
- Shut the fuck up.

1057
01:11:35,961 --> 01:11:37,730
Easy. Easy.

1058
01:11:37,765 --> 01:11:39,468
I'm good, I'm good.

1059
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:40,931
Fuck.

1060
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:46,068
Shit.

1061
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:49,940
Fuck with me, you fucking...

1062
01:11:52,648 --> 01:11:54,549
You're fucked up now, dude!

1063
01:11:56,113 --> 01:11:58,916
I got you!
You're boxed in!

1064
01:12:00,557 --> 01:12:02,920
Where are you gonna go?

1065
01:12:14,802 --> 01:12:16,967
Shit.

1066
01:12:20,643 --> 01:12:22,478
Just tell me w...

1067
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:29,111
Fuck!

1068
01:13:45,695 --> 01:13:46,496
Shit.

1069
01:14:47,988 --> 01:14:50,021
Fuck. Fuck.

1070
01:14:50,859 --> 01:14:52,089
Come on!

1071
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:53,926
Fuck!

1072
01:15:38,137 --> 01:15:40,104
Go on. Fuck off.

1073
01:15:40,139 --> 01:15:41,611
Hey, you guys, go.

1074
01:15:42,812 --> 01:15:43,910
Go home.

1075
01:16:05,098 --> 01:16:06,262
I'm sorry, Will.

1076
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,037
Can you please
just understand this?

1077
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,676
I don't wanna be like this
I don't wanna resent you

1078
01:16:13,711 --> 01:16:15,205
and I don't want you
to resent me.

1079
01:16:16,813 --> 01:16:18,780
- You're my best friend.
- Oh.

1080
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,342
You're my favorite human.

1081
01:16:20,377 --> 01:16:22,047
- What?
- Yeah.

1082
01:16:22,082 --> 01:16:23,917
Out of all the humans,
you're my favorite.

1083
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:26,315
I love you, babe.

1084
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:38,866
Hey, get out of here! Go.

1085
01:16:41,937 --> 01:16:43,134
Go, get lost.

1086
01:16:44,775 --> 01:16:45,972
Lisa?

1087
01:16:48,977 --> 01:16:50,911
You must be
the dumbest motherfucker alive.

1088
01:16:51,313 --> 01:16:53,309
You kidnapped a woman
in broad daylight

1089
01:16:53,344 --> 01:16:55,146
and think nobody saw that shit?

1090
01:16:55,181 --> 01:16:58,116
You're doin' life!
You're doin' life.

1091
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:00,250
<i>Lisa!</i>

1092
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:01,922
So, tell me where she is.

1093
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,728
Lisa! Lisa?

1094
01:17:05,763 --> 01:17:08,258
I'm gonna make you feel so good.

1095
01:17:08,293 --> 01:17:11,833
J... just tell me where she is.

1096
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:16,332
- Where is she?
- She's fuckin' dead, man.

1097
01:17:24,177 --> 01:17:26,881
She's fuckin' dead.

1098
01:17:35,958 --> 01:17:37,023
You killed her?

1099
01:17:40,996 --> 01:17:41,764
Hey.

1100
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:44,866
What the fuck?

1101
01:17:47,035 --> 01:17:48,100
Fuck.

1102
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:54,843
I'm right in knowin'
I'd see you here.

1103
01:17:56,044 --> 01:17:57,846
Yeah, everybody
does a little meth, right?

1104
01:17:58,582 --> 01:18:00,178
I mean
that's easy fuckin' money.

1105
01:18:01,313 --> 01:18:03,247
All right,
what about kidnappin', huh?

1106
01:18:03,282 --> 01:18:05,920
- Is that good money?
- Fuck that.

1107
01:18:05,955 --> 01:18:08,824
- I didn't kidnap anybody.
- You're so full of shit.

1108
01:18:12,225 --> 01:18:13,422
You're not fuckin' kill me?
What are you gonna do?

1109
01:18:13,457 --> 01:18:15,831
You're gonna fuckin' kill me,
huh?

1110
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:17,228
You might wanna ask Frank that.

1111
01:18:18,429 --> 01:18:19,329
Eh?

1112
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:21,331
You're not a fucking killer
either.

1113
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,072
All right, put the gun down.
Lower it.

1114
01:18:26,107 --> 01:18:29,339
You put the fucking gun down!
You put it down!

1115
01:18:32,575 --> 01:18:33,849
All right.

1116
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:40,482
Okay, talk to me.

1117
01:18:41,318 --> 01:18:43,925
I think it's fucking crazy
you care so much about your wife

1118
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,158
when she's gettin' ready
to leave your ass.

1119
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:48,127
I mean, but that's divorce
for you, though, right?

1120
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:49,425
It's like gettin' fucked twice.

1121
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,559
How you know
about the divorce, huh?

1122
01:18:51,594 --> 01:18:53,396
If you're not involved
in the kidnappin'?

1123
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:56,806
Knuckles. Yeah, Knuckles.

1124
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:58,038
Listen,
that's not the fucking point.

1125
01:18:58,073 --> 01:19:00,843
The point is that I know
where the fuck she is.

1126
01:19:00,878 --> 01:19:03,439
All right, where is she?
Tell me where she is!

1127
01:19:05,014 --> 01:19:06,079
She alive?

1128
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:09,049
- Is she alive?
- 20,000.

1129
01:19:11,053 --> 01:19:13,020
Okay, 20,000
and I will fuckin' tell you...

1130
01:19:13,055 --> 01:19:14,483
- You're a lying piece of shit.
- Everything you need to know.

1131
01:19:14,518 --> 01:19:16,155
I don't believe you!

1132
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:17,860
Tell me where she is.
Show me her!

1133
01:19:19,864 --> 01:19:20,863
Hey, prove it!

1134
01:19:23,296 --> 01:19:24,097
Huh?

1135
01:19:25,562 --> 01:19:27,265
It's her fuckin' phone, right?

1136
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:33,942
Right, that's her phone, right?
That's her phone, right?

1137
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:37,143
- Yeah.
- You prick!

1138
01:19:37,178 --> 01:19:38,309
- Okay.
- You fiuckin' prick.

1139
01:19:38,344 --> 01:19:39,176
Okay, now we're talkin', right?

1140
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:40,982
- Yeah.
- Yeah, now we're talkin'.

1141
01:19:41,017 --> 01:19:42,852
- Yeah, now we're talkin'.
- You think I didn't see her?

1142
01:19:42,887 --> 01:19:44,513
I saw her when she bought
that bottle of water.

1143
01:19:44,548 --> 01:19:46,218
Yeah, I saw her.

1144
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:50,189
Come on.
$20,000 and I will tell you.

1145
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,422
Huh?

1146
01:19:54,558 --> 01:20:00,100
All right, I'll give you 20,000.
Oh, my ball's in your court.

1147
01:20:00,135 --> 01:20:02,036
- I'll give you the money.
- Okay.

1148
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:05,501
Okay,
how am I gonna get the money?

1149
01:20:05,536 --> 01:20:06,469
- How am I gonna get the money?
- I'm gonna go...

1150
01:20:07,912 --> 01:20:09,637
No, fuck that!
I want the money right now!

1151
01:20:09,672 --> 01:20:10,538
20,000 and I will get you...

1152
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,541
I'll give you the money,
just get me Lisa.

1153
01:20:12,576 --> 01:20:14,917
- I wanna see her.
- I'm coming with you.

1154
01:20:14,952 --> 01:20:16,919
- I'm coming with you!
- You're not comin' with me!

1155
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:18,481
I'm coming with you! I think
you're gonna call the cops!

1156
01:20:18,516 --> 01:20:20,087
Let me see her!
Let me see my fuckin' wife!

1157
01:20:50,988 --> 01:20:52,251
And how do you know she's dead?

1158
01:20:53,386 --> 01:20:55,254
How do you know she's dead?

1159
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:58,554
- How do you know she's dead?
- Because I dug the fucking hole!

1160
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:06,001
A couple of weeks ago, I was...

1161
01:21:06,036 --> 01:21:08,333
I was just talking shit
with Frank.

1162
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:10,533
I was just fuckin' around
about how this...

1163
01:21:10,568 --> 01:21:13,437
This fuckin' girl I knew
was coming back.

1164
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,439
She married
this fuckin' rich dude

1165
01:21:15,474 --> 01:21:17,309
and we could get a shit ton
of money

1166
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:18,574
if we snatched her, you know?

1167
01:21:18,609 --> 01:21:20,609
He'd wanna get her back,
you know?

1168
01:21:24,186 --> 01:21:26,087
I wasn't fuckin'
thinkin' straight.

1169
01:21:27,123 --> 01:21:28,287
It was fuckin' stupid, man.

1170
01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:29,651
I saw her
at the fucking gas station.

1171
01:21:29,686 --> 01:21:31,653
I just fuckin' snatched her.

1172
01:21:31,688 --> 01:21:33,226
And then I...
I took her to Frank.

1173
01:21:33,261 --> 01:21:37,329
I took her to Frank.
He got so fuckin' mad, man.

1174
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:40,200
He was so fuckin' pissed off
that I took her there,

1175
01:21:40,235 --> 01:21:42,433
'cause he knew... he knew
there were fuckin' cameras.

1176
01:21:42,468 --> 01:21:44,534
That they fuckin' saw me.

1177
01:21:44,569 --> 01:21:47,141
And Frank wouldn't let me leave
with her alive.

1178
01:21:49,244 --> 01:21:51,079
He said
I had to dig a fucking hole

1179
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:52,344
and put her in it.

1180
01:21:53,743 --> 01:21:55,743
I was diggin' the hole,

1181
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:57,987
but I knew Frank
was gonna put me in it, too,

1182
01:21:58,022 --> 01:22:00,550
so I fuckin' ran.

1183
01:22:00,585 --> 01:22:02,992
I didn't wanna hurt her.

1184
01:22:03,027 --> 01:22:04,191
Where's the hole?

1185
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:08,756
- Where is the fucking hole?
- At Frank's house.

1186
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:09,999
Up in Beckley.

1187
01:22:11,662 --> 01:22:14,366
I swear to God,
I just wanted the fuckin' money.

1188
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:27,049
Jesus, fucking.

1189
01:22:48,303 --> 01:22:50,039
Hey, turn that off.

1190
01:23:13,757 --> 01:23:15,361
Drivin' in circles, huh?

1191
01:23:19,169 --> 01:23:20,597
We found Knuckles in your trunk.

1192
01:23:25,802 --> 01:23:27,175
I'm under arrest?

1193
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,706
Stay put.

1194
01:24:58,565 --> 01:24:59,333
Hmm.

1195
01:25:14,614 --> 01:25:17,582
Lisa? Lisa!

1196
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:21,190
Lisa?

1197
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:23,390
What the fuck.

1198
01:25:23,425 --> 01:25:26,228
Okay, I'm comin'.

1199
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:34,302
Lisa. Oh shit, baby.

1200
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:43,905
What the fuck? It's okay.

1201
01:25:44,941 --> 01:25:46,512
It's okay.

1202
01:25:46,547 --> 01:25:47,942
Oh, it's okay, baby.

1203
01:25:50,012 --> 01:25:51,616
I got you.

1204
01:25:53,752 --> 01:25:56,225
It's okay.

1205
01:25:58,295 --> 01:25:59,459
You're okay, see.

1206
01:26:01,595 --> 01:26:03,628
It's okay, it's okay.

1207
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:07,401
Will, please,
get me out of here please.

1208
01:26:09,405 --> 01:26:10,668
Okay, come.

1209
01:26:24,288 --> 01:26:26,915
- I got you.
- Okay.

1210
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:13,467
As I figured,
couldn't stand the guilt.

1211
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:17,064
Knuckles signed the confession,

1212
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:19,737
but he still blames everything
on Frank, by the way.

1213
01:27:19,772 --> 01:27:21,772
But who the fuck knows?

1214
01:27:21,807 --> 01:27:23,411
I think
Oscar caught him in the act

1215
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:25,644
and tried to push himself
into the ransom money.

1216
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:28,416
Wow.

1217
01:27:29,352 --> 01:27:31,485
Look at some real salts
of the earth there, huh?

1218
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,421
One could say that.

1219
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:37,359
By the way uh,

1220
01:27:37,394 --> 01:27:39,658
we inspected
some of the remains.

1221
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:41,088
Not all of them died
in the explosions,

1222
01:27:41,123 --> 01:27:42,859
there were some shots exchanged.

1223
01:27:49,373 --> 01:27:53,903
I said to myself,
"Hey, you lived by the sword."

1224
01:28:03,046 --> 01:28:05,552
- Thank you.
- Take care of yourself.

1225
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:30,577
Can you um, give us a minute?

1226
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,115
- Hi.
- Hey.

1227
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:51,466
- Good?
- Yeah.

1228
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:54,931
Come with me.

1229
01:28:58,871 --> 01:29:01,443
Yeah.

1229
01:29:02,305 --> 01:30:02,429
