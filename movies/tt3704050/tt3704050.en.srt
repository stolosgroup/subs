2
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,456
Ruth?

3
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,759
Ruth?

4
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,416
Where's my wife?

5
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:51,919
Mr. Guttman!
You can't be sneaking up on me like that!

6
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:54,255
Where is my wife? Where is Ruth?

7
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:57,884
I'm sorry, Mr. Guttman,

8
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:01,554
your wife passed away about a week ago.

9
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,808
Ah.

10
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,572
I'm sorry. Who are you?

11
00:02:19,698 --> 00:02:21,532
My name's Paula.

12
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,910
I was Mrs. Guttman's nursing aide.

13
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,246
Your family asked me to stay on
for another week or two.

14
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,583
Let's get some breakfast.

15
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,336
You'll be feeling better after breakfast.

16
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,004
Where are your shoes?

17
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,798
Hold on, let me get you some slippers.
Tell you what.

18
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,634
Trade your hat for some slippers, okay?

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,344
All right. Now come in.

20
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,515
- Good morning, Zev.
- Good morning.

21
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:49,477
I hope you're not too hungry.
Breakfast is crummy as usual.

22
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,395
That's okay. I'm not too hungry.

23
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,857
That's Cele.
She was friends with your wife.

24
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:57,485
I know who she is. I know who she is.

25
00:03:06,495 --> 00:03:08,371
Could you give us a minute, please?

26
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,748
Oh, no problem...

27
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,583
Max.

28
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:15,044
You don't have to tell me everyone's name.

29
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:25,554
Tonight is the last night
sitting shiva for Ruth, yes?

30
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:30,351
Do you remember what you said you would do

31
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,979
when Ruth died?

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,566
No.

33
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,528
It's okay. It's okay.

34
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:42,905
I...

35
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,032
wrote everything down

36
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:46,951
so you...

37
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:48,536
could remember.

38
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,294
Come on, Mr. Rosenbaum.

39
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,647
Darling.

40
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,692
Do you know when this picture was taken?

41
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:24,405
It's from their wedding day.

42
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,574
1946.

43
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:29,118
Did you meet nanny in Germany?

44
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:31,871
Uh, no, no.

45
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:36,125
I met her in America. I met her...

46
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,461
Coney...

47
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,839
- Coney Island.
- Yeah.

48
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,800
Why don't you show this
to your brother, eh?

49
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:48,804
Adam, look at this!

50
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:54,602
Here. Put this away in your pocket.

51
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,605
Now,

52
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,482
stand up.

53
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:02,068
Tell everyone you're tired,

54
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:06,822
and go read it alone.

55
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,657
Alone.

56
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,493
You're tired.

57
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:12,036
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:13,829
Yeah. Good.

59
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,505
Forgive me, I...

60
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,008
I'm a little tired,
I think I should go to bed.

61
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:28,135
Yeah. Okay, Dad.

62
00:05:29,805 --> 00:05:31,013
It's been a long week.

63
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,641
Yeah.

64
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:34,827
- Penn Station, right?
- Yeah.

65
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:55,514
Last call!

66
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,725
49 Lake Shore Limited!

67
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,226
Last call!

68
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,105
Last call, 49 Lake Shore Limited!

69
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:09,945
Is that your mother?

70
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:11,822
Yeah.

71
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,700
She's not coming with you?

72
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,786
No. I'm going to see my dad.

73
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,122
Oh.

74
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,084
So, you're traveling all alone?

75
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,962
I'm not alone.
My brothers are right over there.

76
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:29,757
Oh?

77
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:31,634
Oh, I see.

78
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,222
Are you going to Cleveland too?

79
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,723
Yeah.

80
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:39,642
Why don't you fly? It's faster.

81
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,271
I don't know.

82
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,473
That's not a good reason.

83
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,693
You're a real whipper snapper, aren't you?

84
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,153
Why don't you fly to Cleveland?

85
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,656
Three plane tickets is too expensive.

86
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,824
That's what my mom and dad said.

87
00:07:56,326 --> 00:07:58,077
Well, that is a good reason.

88
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:03,123
I don't fly because
my friend told me to take the train

89
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,752
in the letter he wrote to me.

90
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,924
I guess that's a good reason, too.

91
00:08:12,777 --> 00:08:14,842
My name is Tyler.

92
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,345
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

93
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,806
My name's Zev.

94
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,933
That's a strange name.

95
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,852
In Hebrew, it means "Wolf."

96
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,536
Cool!

97
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,365
I have planned everything for you.

98
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,327
You must follow these steps precisely.

99
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:44,873
Cross them off as you
accomplish each task.

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,378
We've notified the police
and they've issued

101
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,798
a silver alert as well as a reverse 911

102
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,551
to the community, our...
our staff is doing all that we can.

103
00:08:55,677 --> 00:08:57,970
- It's upsetting.
- I just can't believe

104
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,180
this is happening.

105
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:03,058
I can't tell you how sorry we all are.

106
00:09:03,893 --> 00:09:05,894
We do our best
to keep an eye on everybody,

107
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,855
but... I'm sure you can understand.

108
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,940
Is there anything we can do to help?

109
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,651
Besides paying you to lose people?

110
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,070
Does your father have a credit card?

111
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,364
You can tell them
to call you if he uses it.

112
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:22,870
Listen.

113
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:28,292
Your mother's nursing aid told me that
your dad's been very confused lately.

114
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,794
Yeah, yeah.
That's because he has dementia.

115
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,714
And that's why my mother
brought them here in the first place.

116
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,426
I understand that. However, it's very
common after the death of a spouse

117
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:40,846
for more signs
of neurocognitive disorders to emerge.

118
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:44,224
Have you noticed that your father's
been having mood swings?

119
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:47,936
And he rarely plays the piano anymore?

120
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,900
I've noticed a few things, Charles.

121
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,820
I guess we were...

122
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:00,282
so busy with your mom
that I just dismissed them.

123
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,788
Let me reassure you,
we'll have him back here before you know it.

124
00:10:05,914 --> 00:10:07,748
In these situations,

125
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,084
people never wander too far.

126
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,757
Ruth?

127
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,803
Ruth?

128
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,349
Adam?

129
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,267
Where is your grandmother?

130
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:30,896
Adam?

131
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,439
Where is your grandmother?

132
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,900
Were you talking to me, Zev?

133
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,069
I asked you where your grandmother is.

134
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,281
One is in New York. One is in Ohio.

135
00:10:43,868 --> 00:10:45,202
Where is your sister?

136
00:10:46,287 --> 00:10:47,496
I don't have a sister.

137
00:10:49,124 --> 00:10:50,916
Stop playing with that thing.

138
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,292
Answer me.

139
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,338
Are... are you okay, Zev?

140
00:10:58,383 --> 00:10:59,800
Where are we?

141
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,176
We're on a train.

142
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,262
To where?

143
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:04,888
Cleveland.

144
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,015
Cleveland?

145
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,977
You're going to see a friend.

146
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,353
What friend?

147
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,940
The one who wrote you
the letter in your pocket.

148
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,113
Can I have my PSP back?

149
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:42,050
Ruth is dead.

150
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:50,058
Zev,

151
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:53,020
I'm going to sit with my brothers
for a little bit.

152
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:33,268
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

153
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:36,063
Hi. Uh... My son there
said that you were sitting

154
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,607
next to him on the train
and that you seemed a little confused.

155
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,776
Oh, yes, that.

156
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:42,611
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

157
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,404
There's no need to apologize. We...

158
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:47,741
- just want to make sure you're okay.
- Oh, yes, I'm okay.

159
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,035
Thank you. I'm okay.

160
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,995
Um... You need help getting somewhere?

161
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:55,082
No, no. Someone will be meeting me here.

162
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,001
My friend said that he had a...

163
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,962
sign with my name on it.

164
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,339
Okay. Well, we'll help you find him.

165
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,217
The cars are just down here.

166
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,139
Is your last name Guttman?

167
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,933
Yeah.

168
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,977
Looks like you're riding in style.

169
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,272
Bye, Zev.

170
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,566
Goodbye. Goodbye.

171
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:22,442
Let's go, boys.

172
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,194
- Mr. Guttman?
- Yeah.

173
00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:26,154
Good.

174
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,669
- Good evening.
- Evening.

175
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:42,838
How can I help you?

176
00:13:42,964 --> 00:13:46,133
My friend recommended your shop to me.

177
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,011
Well, tell your friend
we appreciate the recommendation.

178
00:13:49,137 --> 00:13:51,305
- What are you looking to pick up?
- Oh...

179
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:53,682
Something small.

180
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:55,892
Sure thing. Okay.

181
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,936
- Can I see your driver's license?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:07,154
Yeah...

183
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,489
Okay.

184
00:14:10,074 --> 00:14:12,242
Beachwood. Nice town.

185
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:13,952
Yes. But, um...

186
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,579
We've moved.

187
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:18,498
We live closer to my son.

188
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,960
What are you doing with my license?

189
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:26,048
I'm entering your information
into the FBI background check database.

190
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:27,341
Oh.

191
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,259
What do they look for?

192
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,887
A bunch of stuff.
Whether you're a convicted felon,

193
00:14:32,013 --> 00:14:33,597
if you've been involved
in a crime of violence,

194
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:35,307
dishonorably discharged from the army,

195
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:38,393
mentally competent.
If you've got more than one DUI offense

196
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,437
in the last five years,
if you're a fugitive,

197
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:42,356
- or currently charged with a felony.
- Fugitive?

198
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,441
Yeah, like, if you're
running from the law.

199
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:47,794
Do I look like I can run?

200
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:54,242
Uh, okay. Let me show you
some of our smaller handguns.

201
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:57,371
We got everything.
SIG Sauers, 1911s, Glocks,

202
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,039
single action, double action.

203
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,249
- Sir, do you know much about guns?
- Um...

204
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,628
- No. Why?
- It's all right.

205
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,254
We get all types in here.

206
00:15:06,756 --> 00:15:08,340
Uh, okay. Beginners...

207
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:10,467
usually go with a .22.

208
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,678
It's light. Easy to use.
Very little recoil.

209
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,641
I think that's what my friend suggested.

210
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,476
Okay. In my opinion,

211
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:22,521
you might as well get yourself a BB gun
if you get a .22.

212
00:15:23,231 --> 00:15:27,192
Look, I'm not trying
to give you the hard sell, but $500 more,

213
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:30,404
you can get yourself a gun
with real stopping power.

214
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:34,658
Now this is a 9mm Glock 17.

215
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:37,035
Glock? It is German, no?

216
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:39,579
You're in the right neighborhood.
Manufactured in Austria.

217
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:43,375
That's the most popular
law enforcement pistol in the world. Okay?

218
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:45,961
It's got very little recoil
so probably won't hurt your hand

219
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,921
but it'll definitely hurt the intruder.

220
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,590
Is it easy to use?

221
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,175
I hope!

222
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:53,719
Yeah, it's simple.

223
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,804
Yeah, but...

224
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,265
Would you mind, could you...

225
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,267
write down the instructions for me?

226
00:16:02,478 --> 00:16:05,021
Uh, sure. I mean,
I can show you how to use it.

227
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:08,817
No, that would be good.
But please, write it down for me.

228
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:11,528
Sometimes I forget things.

229
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:21,663
Yeah, we all do, right? That's no problem.

230
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:23,540
Okay, you're good to go.

231
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,500
I'll grab a pen, and, um...

232
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:27,461
write it all down for you.

233
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,388
- Mr. Guttman?
- Guttman. Yeah...

234
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:39,598
How did you know?

235
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:42,392
Your friend called earlier
and said you'd be arriving soon.

236
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,227
Your room's all ready for you.

237
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,146
We have you in...

238
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:49,149
125. Just down the hall.

239
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,612
- How much do I owe?
- It's all taken care of,

240
00:16:53,738 --> 00:16:55,363
including incidentals.

241
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:59,034
Oh, and I booked your taxi for the morning,
like your friend asked.

242
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,535
Thank you.

243
00:17:16,677 --> 00:17:18,553
- Hello?
- Hello.

244
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,764
- Zev?
- Yeah.

245
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,265
It's Max.

246
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,393
I gave the hotel some instructions.

247
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:29,272
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes, I'm okay, Max.

248
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,527
And you got the gun?

249
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,695
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:37,781
Good. Good.

251
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:40,617
You know what to do.

252
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:44,579
Just take care of yourself, yeah?

253
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:48,333
You have a good night, Max.

254
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,751
Good night, Zev.

255
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:30,667
Ruth?

256
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:33,461
Ruth?

257
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:39,467
Ruth?

258
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:42,637
Turn on the lights, please.

259
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:45,974
It's dark in here. I can't...

260
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:47,976
I can't see.

261
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,601
- Hello.
- Hi.

262
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:14,604
Is Rudy Kurlander home?

263
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,481
Yeah. He is downstairs.

264
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,102
Are you...

265
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:55,770
Rudy Kurlander?

266
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:57,647
Yes.

267
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,441
I'm Rudy Kurlander.

268
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,234
Who are you?

269
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,569
Can you, uh...

270
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:04,070
turn off the television?

271
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,803
Do I know you?

272
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,545
Now, please...

273
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,091
stand by the window.

274
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:27,927
Who are you?

275
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:31,389
Stand by the window.

276
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,517
I am not going to do anything
until you tell me

277
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:36,394
who you are and why you're here.

278
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,605
Let us not argue.

279
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,107
Just stand by the window.

280
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,682
Now what?

281
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:22,482
I need to see light on your face.

282
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:25,902
- Turn your head.
- Who are you?

283
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,529
Don't yell.

284
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:28,863
Please, don't yell.

285
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,075
Do as I say. Turn your head.

286
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:37,664
Are you German?

287
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,207
Yeah.

288
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,002
- You are also German?
- Ja.

289
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:45,797
How old are you?

290
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,091
Eighty-eight.

291
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:51,219
Were you in the German army?

292
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,055
What did you do?

293
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,851
- It is in the past.
- English. Please, English.

294
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:01,646
- I do not like to speak German.
- It's seventy years ago.

295
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:03,106
I was very young.

296
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:04,732
Answer the question.

297
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:08,695
Are you a Jew?

298
00:23:10,072 --> 00:23:11,156
Yeah.

299
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,242
- Were you at Auschwitz?
- No!

300
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:16,995
We are too old for lies.

301
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,708
I didn't know about Auschwitz

302
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,252
until after the war.

303
00:23:24,587 --> 00:23:26,171
I was in North Africa.

304
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,132
With General Rommel.

305
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:34,095
- You have proof?
- Yes.

306
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:37,056
Over there.

307
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:50,111
When I became a US citizen,
the immigration officer asked me

308
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,573
if I had ever associated

309
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,909
with the Nazi government of Germany

310
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,037
or worked at a concentration camp.

311
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:03,625
I told the officer what I'll tell you.

312
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:07,962
Yes, I served for my country.
I was a soldier.

313
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,299
I was a proud German
and that's what the men did.

314
00:24:12,635 --> 00:24:15,303
I'm still proud of my service.

315
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,229
That's Rommel.

316
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:28,650
As far as the Jews...

317
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:36,241
I didn't care about the Jews.
I thought Hitler was right.

318
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:40,328
They caused many problems for the country.

319
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,125
I thought we were deporting them
or putting them in work camps...

320
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:48,753
Not what they did.

321
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:53,716
It was shameful,

322
00:24:54,635 --> 00:24:56,010
but that was not me.

323
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:12,151
- Hello?
- Is this Max?

324
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:14,070
Yes.

325
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:15,989
This is Zev.

326
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:17,740
Uh... It was...

327
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:19,367
not him.

328
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:24,038
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

329
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,958
Then you must go on.

330
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:29,294
You must do

331
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,963
what you said you would.

332
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:49,105
There have been rumors for years

333
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:53,109
that a number of Auschwitz SS officers

334
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:57,071
stole the identities of executed prisoners

335
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:58,906
near the end of the war.

336
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:02,618
Shortly after my stroke,

337
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:06,164
evidence was found
that an Auschwitz Blockführer

338
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:10,293
emigrated from Germany in the 1940s

339
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:14,255
and was most likely living under the name

340
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:16,674
Rudy Kurlander.

341
00:26:17,301 --> 00:26:19,594
The Simon Wiesenthal Center

342
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,930
has found four Rudy Kurlanders

343
00:26:23,057 --> 00:26:25,350
who emigrated during that period.

344
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,644
However, there is not enough proof

345
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:30,688
to arrest any of them.

346
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,446
His real name is Otto Wallisch.

347
00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:43,868
You must find him.

348
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:52,460
I'm looking for my father.
He's almost 90 years old.

349
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,172
His name is Zev.

350
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:57,882
I'm looking for my father.

351
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,009
He's 90 years old.

352
00:27:00,135 --> 00:27:02,845
He went wandering a few days ago.

353
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,640
His name is Zev Guttman.

354
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:08,976
I don't know if he has
any identification on him,

355
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:11,938
or... I don't even know
if he remembers his name.

356
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:15,400
I've been wondering if anybody
has been brought into the hospital.

357
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:21,155
Do you not think
I've already called the police?

358
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,374
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're approaching the Canadian border,

359
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,627
at which point, we're all gonna have
to get off the bus for inspection.

360
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,046
If you can have your passports
and any travel documents ready,

361
00:27:37,172 --> 00:27:40,091
it'll make the process a lot faster.
Thank you.

362
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:05,032
Declaration card?

363
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:08,911
Purpose of your trip?

364
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:11,539
To see a friend.

365
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:12,832
What's your friend's name?

366
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,042
- Rudy Kurlander.
- Where does he live?

367
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,546
Foyer Des... Foyer...

368
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,346
- Can I see that?
- Yeah, of course.

369
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:32,351
- Foyer Des Pionniers Nursing Home?
- Yeah.

370
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,770
And you'll be staying
at the Queen's Motel in Hearst, Ontario?

371
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:35,897
That's right.

372
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:37,565
How long will you be in Canada?

373
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:40,902
Two nights. Maybe.

374
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,279
Passport?

375
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,050
Sir, your passport's expired.

376
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:07,220
- It is?
- Yeah.

377
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:12,141
Do you have a driver's license?

378
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,018
Oh, of course.

379
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,233
Hang on a second.

380
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:39,418
Alright, you're good to go.

381
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,379
But, sir, renew your passport.

382
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,259
I didn't think it was necessary at my age.

383
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:49,136
Have fun with your friend.

384
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:50,638
Thank you.

385
00:30:24,506 --> 00:30:25,798
Excuse me.

386
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,008
How can I help you, sir?

387
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:30,678
Rudy Kurlander. Which room is he in?

388
00:30:31,013 --> 00:30:32,513
Kurlander?

389
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,016
Yes, Kurlander. He's in room 238.

390
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:38,269
Just go down this hallway
and take the elevators.

391
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:42,023
When you exit the elevator,
make a left, then you take a right.

392
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:44,066
238 will be on your left.

393
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,694
Did you get that?

394
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,072
Why don't I just show you
where your friend's room is?

395
00:30:50,198 --> 00:30:51,198
Thank you.

396
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,063
Uh... Are you Rudy Kurlander?

397
00:31:25,108 --> 00:31:26,859
Rudy Kurlander?

398
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,235
Here.

399
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:58,099
- Are you Rudy Kurlander?
- Yeah.

400
00:32:01,144 --> 00:32:02,311
Are you German?

401
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:04,146
Yes.

402
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,569
Were you at Auschwitz?

403
00:32:14,241 --> 00:32:15,449
Yes.

404
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:22,123
I was at Auschwitz.

405
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:27,253
My whole family was

406
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,339
murdered

407
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,508
at Auschwitz.

408
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:36,595
I'm so sorry.

409
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,266
You're... you're sorry?

410
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,394
Yeah.

411
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,527
What you did is something
you cannot apologize for.

412
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:59,160
I swore I would kill the man responsible

413
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:01,120
for the death of my family.

414
00:33:11,673 --> 00:33:13,424
You're Jewish?

415
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:15,593
Homosexual.

416
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,309
It is I who am sorry.

417
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:32,193
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

418
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:53,232
Moszkowski.

419
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:55,943
You know Moszkowski?

420
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:59,113
My old piano teacher used to say

421
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:01,782
that the three greatest composers

422
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,869
were Mendelssohn, Meyerbeer

423
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:06,704
and Moszkowski.

424
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:09,957
- Do you still play?
- Oh...

425
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:14,545
No. No, I don't know, I'm not sure!

426
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:15,796
Well...

427
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:19,758
Why don't you give it a try?

428
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,386
Oh... Well...

429
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:27,266
Mendelssohn.

430
00:35:27,642 --> 00:35:28,851
Maybe.

431
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:19,420
Hello, sir. Welcome to Boise.

432
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:22,089
Do you have a reservation?

433
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:25,467
I have a note that you need
a taxi pickup at 8:00 am.

434
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:30,597
So, we have our complimentary breakfast
which starts at 6:00 a.m.

435
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,811
And if you just head through
the lobby to your left...

436
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:44,653
Here, let me help you, okay?

437
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:55,497
There is one thing.
I forgot to pack more clothes.

438
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:56,999
- Extra clothes.
- Oh!

439
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,626
We can definitely help you out with that.

440
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:02,504
So, there's a downtown shuttle
that leaves every hour on the hour

441
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,383
and it's going to drop you right off
at the mall on North Milwaukee street.

442
00:38:07,594 --> 00:38:09,803
You should be able to get
everything you need there...

443
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:18,771
Sir, would you like me to do that?

444
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:20,814
Sir, are you okay?

445
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:26,403
Would you like to head up
to your room now? Okay.

446
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:42,795
- Can I help you find anything?
- Oh, yes.

447
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,172
I want to buy a new shirt.

448
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,008
We have a great deal
on short-sleeve button downs.

449
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,051
- Yeah?
- Can I show you?

450
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,053
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

451
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,305
You can always find the best deals
at the end of the season.

452
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,848
Oh, right.

453
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,068
Excuse me, sir. You set off the alarm.

454
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,903
I'm gonna have to check your bag.

455
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:09,947
Oh. Do I look like a thief?

456
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,699
Oh, it doesn't matter, sir,
you set off the alarm.

457
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:14,993
I've got to check your bag
no matter what, so...

458
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
There's the receipt.

459
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,705
Oh, there's your problem right there.

460
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,707
They left the security tag on.

461
00:39:21,209 --> 00:39:23,043
I'll have to check
your other bag too, sir.

462
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:36,056
Is that a Glock?

463
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
Yeah.

464
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:44,660
Reminds me of my first gun.

465
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:46,525
You have a good day, sir.

466
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:50,946
- There you go. Thanks very much.
- Thank you. Thank you...

467
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:48,420
Would you like a refill?

468
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,822
- Yes. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

469
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,635
Could you tell me how far
is Bruneau is from here?

470
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:57,679
I've never actually been to Bruneau,
but it's in Owyhee County,

471
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:00,641
so, I'd say that should probably take you
about 30, 40 minutes or so.

472
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:02,893
- Oh.
- I heard it's beautiful country down there.

473
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:04,561
I never get to go but my friends...

474
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:05,812
- Oh!
- Ah.

475
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:07,105
Oh, I'm so sorry!

476
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,024
- I got coffee on your letter.
- Oh, God.

477
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,108
No, you're ruining my letter!

478
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,027
- No, no, no!
- I'm sorry.

479
00:41:12,153 --> 00:41:15,656
This letter is very important!
Stop! Stop! Stop!

480
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:25,082
"Besides me,

481
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:29,294
"you are the only person

482
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:35,008
"who can still recognize

483
00:41:38,054 --> 00:41:41,974
"the face of the man

484
00:41:42,892 --> 00:41:48,313
"who murdered our families."

485
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,406
- Nobody's home?
- No.

486
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,283
You want me to take you somewhere else?

487
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,202
- No, no, no. I will wait.
- Here.

488
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:49,249
Give me a call whenever you want me
to come back and get you.

489
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:51,335
What do I owe you?

490
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,171
Oh, you already paid me, remember?

491
00:42:56,424 --> 00:42:58,300
Just call me if you need a ride later.

492
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:49,976
Morning.

493
00:43:53,356 --> 00:43:55,599
Morning to you too, sweetie.

494
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:07,828
Yeah...

495
00:44:11,499 --> 00:44:12,999
Dinner time, Mr. Rosenbaum.

496
00:44:14,335 --> 00:44:15,335
Uh...

497
00:44:15,837 --> 00:44:17,337
Bring me back some food, yeah?

498
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,049
Are you sure? You haven't been
outside the apartment all day.

499
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:23,844
- Yes.
- Okay.

500
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:56,334
Can I help you with something?

501
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:00,005
I'm looking for Rudy Kurlander.

502
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:06,219
Well, you came
to the right place but, uh...

503
00:45:09,265 --> 00:45:11,808
My old man passed away
about three months ago.

504
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,562
Oh, I didn't know this. I am so sorry.

505
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:18,899
Hmm...

506
00:45:23,571 --> 00:45:25,071
How long have you been waiting here?

507
00:45:26,574 --> 00:45:27,574
All day.

508
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:32,287
You want a drink?

509
00:45:34,373 --> 00:45:35,540
A drink would be nice.

510
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:37,876
Come on in.

511
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,253
I could use another drink myself.

512
00:45:40,379 --> 00:45:42,881
- Thank you.
- Beer or a water?

513
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,217
Just water, please.

514
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:50,972
Oh, Eva. Good girl. Good girl.

515
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:54,601
Listen, I am a little scared of dogs.

516
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,603
Eva's all bark and no bite. Come on in.

517
00:45:56,979 --> 00:46:00,440
But I'm sure that's true
but I'm... I'm quite scared.

518
00:46:00,566 --> 00:46:02,400
Oh, I'll put her away for you. Okay.

519
00:46:02,944 --> 00:46:04,736
Here we go. Good girl.

520
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,112
Quiet, girl. Eva!

521
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:10,951
Eva, shush, quiet.
Girl, quiet. Calm down, Eva. Shush.

522
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:13,453
Eva, shush. Shush.

523
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:16,081
Eva, calm down now. Calm down.

524
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:23,088
Quiet!

525
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:42,482
That's my, um, kid's graduation.

526
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:45,360
Dad always loved that photo.

527
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:48,280
- I'm gonna get... grab your water for you.
- Yeah.

528
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:51,032
When was that taken?
Your father looks so young.

529
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,618
That was, uh, in 1997.

530
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,998
- Oh.
- Yeah. Dad aged well, didn't he?

531
00:46:58,124 --> 00:46:59,332
1997.

532
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:04,129
He always said that he was
one of the Kurlanders with good genes.

533
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,590
Here you go.

534
00:47:14,098 --> 00:47:16,391
Oh, you were thirstier than Eva.

535
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:19,352
- Another one?
- Oh, please.

536
00:47:19,687 --> 00:47:21,563
And then I won't bother you again.

537
00:47:21,689 --> 00:47:24,024
Oh, no, no. It's no bother at all.

538
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,359
Stay as long as you like.

539
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,197
Ever since, uh... since Dad died,
it's been pretty lonely out here.

540
00:47:33,534 --> 00:47:36,036
You know, I'm just driving around

541
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,291
doing my rounds, with nothing but the radio
and the occasional dispatch.

542
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:45,211
It's good to have someone to talk to
when I come home.

543
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:48,214
Eva's great and all,
but not much for conversation.

544
00:47:48,674 --> 00:47:51,051
- Here's your water.
- You're not married?

545
00:47:51,177 --> 00:47:54,179
No, no. Have a seat.
I was, you know, twice.

546
00:47:55,097 --> 00:47:57,432
The first one, uh, took my house,

547
00:47:58,392 --> 00:48:00,801
the second one left before...

548
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:02,962
the quarry takes this one.

549
00:48:03,272 --> 00:48:06,358
That was...
Ooh, hell, seven years already.

550
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:08,693
I wouldn't mind getting another one,

551
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:12,530
but Bruneau ain't exactly
the best singles scene

552
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:16,326
and, well, I ain't exactly the best single.

553
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:23,333
Did your father ever talk to you
about Germany?

554
00:48:24,585 --> 00:48:25,752
Are you kidding me?

555
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:28,088
He never stopped talking about Germany.

556
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,424
Did he ever speak to you about the war?

557
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,009
Of course.

558
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,178
You know he was a collector, right?

559
00:48:35,763 --> 00:48:36,763
Ah.

560
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:41,309
I got a bunch of his stuff.
You wanna go take a look?

561
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:43,269
Yeah.

562
00:48:44,105 --> 00:48:45,772
Watch your step. Just come down here.

563
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:56,616
Eva, quiet! Eva, shh.

564
00:48:56,742 --> 00:49:00,328
Hey, listen, uh,
it's kind of a mess in here.

565
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:02,247
Let me just move some boxes and I'll...

566
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:05,125
I'll let you in the other room.

567
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:11,297
Here we go.

568
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:14,592
There we go. There. Come on. Oh!

569
00:49:16,804 --> 00:49:17,804
Come on in.

570
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:27,772
That was, uh...
that was Dad's pride and joy.

571
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:36,156
The dealer he bought it from swore
it was flying in Berlin on November 19, 1938.

572
00:49:37,283 --> 00:49:38,533
Kristallnacht.

573
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,286
Kristallnacht... Yeah.

574
00:49:43,664 --> 00:49:46,708
Dad used to say that that flag, um,

575
00:49:47,293 --> 00:49:50,837
witnessed the beginning of history.

576
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:53,339
You know?

577
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,723
- What is in these boxes?
- Uh, just...

578
00:50:02,683 --> 00:50:05,727
a bunch more of Dad's prize pieces.
You know?

579
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:08,188
I already sold most of the collection

580
00:50:08,314 --> 00:50:13,693
but, uh, these are the things
he was sentimental about.

581
00:50:15,696 --> 00:50:19,449
Just haven't been able
to let myself get rid of 'em, you know?

582
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:25,455
You wanna look around?
You wanna look around?

583
00:50:25,581 --> 00:50:27,207
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

584
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,307
Yeah, that was a first printing.

585
00:50:45,226 --> 00:50:48,645
A guy offered me six grand for it
but I just... just couldn't part with it.

586
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:54,099
I guess I'm just as sentimental
as my old man, huh?

587
00:50:56,862 --> 00:51:00,323
You're welcome to look around
at... at anything you like.

588
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:02,742
I'm just gonna give Eva her dinner.

589
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:23,596
Quiet! Shh!

590
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:40,905
Priceless, right?

591
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:44,367
Yeah.

592
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,746
I guess I shouldn't leave it
stuffed in a box like that.

593
00:52:04,305 --> 00:52:05,430
You want another drink?

594
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,473
Yes. That would be good.

595
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:11,811
More water, or something
a little stronger?

596
00:52:12,605 --> 00:52:14,981
Maybe something a little stronger.

597
00:52:15,482 --> 00:52:16,482
All right.

598
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:19,402
Now you're speaking my language.

599
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:20,820
Yeah...

600
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,577
To Dad.

601
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,001
You know, my dad was, uh...

602
00:52:36,337 --> 00:52:37,545
My dad was there that night.

603
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,882
- What night was that?
- Um, Kristal...

604
00:52:41,008 --> 00:52:42,800
- Kristallnacht.
- Yeah. Kristallnacht.

605
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:45,637
Yeah, he said he had a hammer

606
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,431
and he broke a bunch
of jewelry store windows.

607
00:52:48,557 --> 00:52:50,475
- He ever tell you that story?
- No.

608
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:51,684
No?

609
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:54,604
I so wish you were here
when he was still alive.

610
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:58,149
You know, every once in a while,
some of his buddies would come by

611
00:52:58,275 --> 00:53:01,736
and they'd just sit around,
tell stories, drink, you know?

612
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:05,490
He loved to talk about the old days.

613
00:53:07,326 --> 00:53:08,952
You okay? You're sweating there.

614
00:53:09,662 --> 00:53:12,455
- Oh, I feel a little hot. Yes.
- Well, take your jacket off.

615
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:13,748
Come here. Mmm.

616
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:17,752
Yeah, take your jacket off
and, hey, I just want to tell you something.

617
00:53:17,878 --> 00:53:19,587
- You are more than welcome...
- Oh.

618
00:53:19,713 --> 00:53:22,799
...to spend the night if you like,
if you don't mind sleeping in dad's old bed.

619
00:53:22,925 --> 00:53:24,926
- You're very kind. No, thank you.
- No, no.

620
00:53:25,052 --> 00:53:28,012
- Well, all right, the offer's on the table.
- Oh, thank you.

621
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:30,807
Any friend of Dad's is a friend of mine.

622
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:35,603
How'd you know him?
Did you serve with my dad?

623
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:38,898
- No.
- Well, how did you know him then?

624
00:53:40,943 --> 00:53:43,736
I knew him from Auschwitz.

625
00:53:49,785 --> 00:53:50,785
Auschwitz?

626
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,913
My dad wished he served at Auschwitz.

627
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:56,916
You mean your father was not at Auschwitz?

628
00:53:58,002 --> 00:53:58,960
What are you...

629
00:53:59,086 --> 00:54:01,629
Are you serious?
My dad was a cook in the army.

630
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,511
He was not a Blockführer?

631
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:13,558
I don't even know what that is.
No, my dad was 10 when the war started.

632
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,477
Most that the Germans
let him do was, you know,

633
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:19,355
break a bunch of windows
and cook some Wiener Schnitzel, you know?

634
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:22,692
I am sorry to have bothered you.

635
00:54:22,818 --> 00:54:27,113
- I have the wrong Rudy Kurlander.
- No, no, no. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

636
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:30,992
Wait a minute, you were at Auschwitz?

637
00:54:31,118 --> 00:54:33,578
- Oh.
- None of my dad's buddies served at a camp.

638
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:35,663
I must leave you now.
I have bothered you enough.

639
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:37,665
Bothered me? No, no, no. Please stay.

640
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:40,710
Please stay. Share some stories.

641
00:54:40,836 --> 00:54:42,962
I'll grab another bottle. We'll just...

642
00:54:50,137 --> 00:54:51,554
What's that?

643
00:54:57,102 --> 00:54:58,102
What is that?

644
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:00,646
What the fuck is that?

645
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:04,817
Well... I'm sorry. I...

646
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:06,611
I, uh...

647
00:55:08,781 --> 00:55:09,989
What the fuck is that?

648
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:15,995
Are you a Jew?

649
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:19,749
Yeah.

650
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:22,710
You're a Jew?

651
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,507
What the fuck's going on here?

652
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:29,675
I'm sorry, I...

653
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:32,553
Sit the fuck down.

654
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,849
Please, let me go.

655
00:55:39,686 --> 00:55:41,646
What the fuck are you doing in my house?

656
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:45,024
I made a mistake.
Your father is the wrong man.

657
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,442
My father?

658
00:55:49,696 --> 00:55:51,614
You said you were a friend of my dad.

659
00:55:53,534 --> 00:55:54,742
You lied to me.

660
00:55:54,868 --> 00:55:59,455
- I did not lie. I did not lie!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

661
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:06,045
You said you were a friend of my dad,
you come into my house

662
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,714
and you drink my fucking whiskey,

663
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:11,759
and you're a dirty fucking Jew.

664
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:14,011
Eva, shut the fuck up!

665
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:16,556
Stop yelling!
Please, stop yelling! I will go.

666
00:56:16,682 --> 00:56:17,807
Sit the fuck down!

667
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:20,560
You gotta answer some questions
right fucking now!

668
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:28,234
Holy shit! Did you just piss on my couch?

669
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:32,238
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck?

670
00:56:32,573 --> 00:56:33,573
Stop yelling!

671
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,119
Eva, shut the fuck up!
Are you giving me a fucking order, Jew?

672
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:40,580
Eva, I said, "Shut the fuck up!"
You know...

673
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:46,586
you know what my dad would say if he knew
a fucking Jew was in his house, huh?

674
00:56:46,712 --> 00:56:49,672
He would say, "Heil fucking Hitler."

675
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:50,715
That's what he'd say. Yeah.

676
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:54,802
Heil fucking Hitler!
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!

677
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:57,054
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler, you fucking Jew!

678
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,015
Eva, goddamn it, shut the fuck up!

679
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:00,766
Shut up! What's your problem?

680
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:03,269
Huh? Shut up!

681
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,147
Stop it! Eva, quiet!

682
00:57:06,773 --> 00:57:07,857
Eva!

683
00:57:07,983 --> 00:57:10,943
Damn it, shut up! Shut up, damn it! Quiet!

684
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:12,820
Eva, settle down.

685
00:57:17,284 --> 00:57:19,160
You want to meet a real life fucking Jew?

686
00:57:19,286 --> 00:57:20,620
Huh? Huh?

687
00:57:20,746 --> 00:57:21,954
Huh? Go get him.

688
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,127
What the...

689
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,300
You fucking kike!

690
00:57:34,635 --> 00:57:35,718
You fucking...

691
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,268
You've reached John Kurlander.

692
00:59:07,394 --> 00:59:10,229
Leave me a message.
Or if it's an emergency, call my cell phone.

693
00:59:10,772 --> 00:59:11,731
Ruth?

694
00:59:11,857 --> 00:59:14,108
Where you at, John?
You're a half hour late

695
00:59:14,234 --> 00:59:15,901
and I can't cover your ass all morning.

696
00:59:16,028 --> 00:59:18,654
- I swear, you best be having car trouble...
- What are you saying?

697
00:59:51,104 --> 00:59:52,104
My God.

698
01:00:05,827 --> 01:00:07,119
Oh...

699
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:45,825
Hello.

700
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:50,204
- Max, it's Zev.
- Where have you been?

701
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:54,166
I killed a man.

702
01:00:56,336 --> 01:00:57,336
Uh...

703
01:00:58,797 --> 01:01:04,301
Now is the hardest part.
You must call the police.

704
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:06,720
- You must...
- No, no!

705
01:01:06,847 --> 01:01:09,265
He was not the man we are looking for.

706
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:16,230
- Who was he?
- It was a much younger man.

707
01:01:16,356 --> 01:01:19,442
I, uh... I saw his name on a box.

708
01:01:20,026 --> 01:01:21,986
It was John Kurlander.

709
01:01:23,155 --> 01:01:24,405
He is a Nazi.

710
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:31,120
- How do you know this?
- There were many Nazi things

711
01:01:31,246 --> 01:01:33,205
- in the house. Many things.
- Oh.

712
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:38,252
This is not what we set out to do.

713
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,380
Zev.

714
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,383
Do you want to continue?

715
01:01:45,427 --> 01:01:48,220
Yes, I must finish.

716
01:01:49,222 --> 01:01:50,222
I must.

717
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:55,060
After all, this is the man
who killed our families.

718
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:16,225
Ruth?

719
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:20,645
Ruth?

720
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,049
Ruth!

721
01:03:43,128 --> 01:03:44,128
Hello.

722
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:46,589
Yes.

723
01:03:51,052 --> 01:03:54,013
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you so much.

724
01:03:57,684 --> 01:03:58,684
Is he okay?

725
01:04:00,186 --> 01:04:02,229
No, he has dementia. Mm-hmm.

726
01:04:04,524 --> 01:04:05,524
I'm sorry. Uh...

727
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:08,319
Where are you calling from?
I can be there right away.

728
01:04:11,406 --> 01:04:13,073
Reno Memorial Hospital?

729
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:15,534
Reno, Nevada? Reno?

730
01:04:16,536 --> 01:04:18,704
Is it possible that I could
speak with my father?

731
01:04:22,709 --> 01:04:24,418
Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much.

732
01:04:24,544 --> 01:04:28,076
Guys, I gotta sneeze.

733
01:04:41,144 --> 01:04:42,186
Hello.

734
01:04:43,438 --> 01:04:44,438
Oh, hello, Charles.

735
01:04:46,024 --> 01:04:49,318
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

736
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:50,653
Thank you.

737
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:54,114
I told the doctors not to bother you.

738
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:55,449
Huh?

739
01:04:56,201 --> 01:04:58,327
Please, don't you worry about me.

740
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:02,289
No. No. No.
Don't you come to the hospital.

741
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:04,583
Your mother will pick me up.

742
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:08,587
Maybe you come with her, huh?

743
01:05:09,756 --> 01:05:14,259
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Goodbye. Goodbye.

744
01:05:24,062 --> 01:05:25,479
Do you like cartoons?

745
01:05:25,605 --> 01:05:27,231
I like Disney Channel.

746
01:05:27,774 --> 01:05:31,235
- Mickey Mouse?
- No. I like Phineas and Ferb.

747
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:32,653
Oh.

748
01:05:32,779 --> 01:05:34,363
I never heard of them.

749
01:05:35,115 --> 01:05:36,490
I'll be right back, Molly.

750
01:05:38,243 --> 01:05:40,035
You finish your homework please.

751
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,250
- Your name is Molly?
- Molly Elizabeth.

752
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:50,129
Do you like sweets, Molly Elizabeth?

753
01:05:51,464 --> 01:05:53,048
Well, uh...

754
01:05:53,466 --> 01:05:58,095
I think there are some caramels
in my coat pocket.

755
01:05:59,347 --> 01:06:02,516
I always keep some there
for my grandchildren.

756
01:06:03,143 --> 01:06:04,143
Ah.

757
01:06:05,645 --> 01:06:07,187
I can't find any.

758
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:12,151
Well, my wife will bring some
when she comes.

759
01:06:19,325 --> 01:06:21,618
- Are you Zev?
- Yes.

760
01:06:22,495 --> 01:06:24,121
Can I open your letter?

761
01:06:24,497 --> 01:06:25,497
Uh-huh.

762
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:31,545
- Whoa, you're rich!
- What?

763
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:44,141
Who's Max?

764
01:06:45,185 --> 01:06:46,185
Max?

765
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:48,687
I'm not sure.

766
01:06:52,567 --> 01:06:57,362
Wait. Why don't you read
the letter to me out loud?

767
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:04,787
"Zev, there are some difficult things
you must know.

768
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:10,209
"Firstly, Ruth has passed away.

769
01:07:10,752 --> 01:07:12,753
"She had cancer.

770
01:07:13,463 --> 01:07:18,884
"She loved you and you were with her,
holding her hand, at the end.

771
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:24,723
"Secondly, you have dementia.

772
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:28,852
"Recently you have been
forgetting many things."

773
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,232
That's normal.
Old people always forget things.

774
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:34,733
Yeah. Yeah.

775
01:07:35,735 --> 01:07:39,238
"You and I have a similar history.

776
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:43,367
"We are both Auschwitz...

777
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:46,912
- Auschwitz. Auschwitz.
- "Auschwitz survivors.

778
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:53,377
"Look at your left arm,
you were prisoner 98814.

779
01:08:00,635 --> 01:08:03,303
"When the war ended,

780
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:06,765
"I promised myself

781
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:12,604
"I would find the men responsible.

782
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:17,401
"Working with Simon Wiesenthal,

783
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:22,698
"I have helped to capture
dozens of former Nazis

784
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:25,200
"all around the world."

785
01:08:25,326 --> 01:08:28,287
- What's a Nazi?
- Nazi. Nazi.

786
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,374
A bad person.

787
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:39,840
Six months ago, God smiled upon me

788
01:08:39,966 --> 01:08:44,219
when you moved
to the senior housing community.

789
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:48,974
I immediately recognized you
from Auschwitz,

790
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:52,352
although you did not remember me.

791
01:08:54,314 --> 01:08:59,526
We are the last living survivors
from our prison block.

792
01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:03,530
Besides me, you are the only person

793
01:09:03,656 --> 01:09:08,702
who could still recognize the face of the man
who murdered our families.

794
01:09:10,622 --> 01:09:13,373
Simon Wiesenthal insisted

795
01:09:13,499 --> 01:09:17,377
that all war criminals
be given public trials.

796
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,759
However, we cannot give Wallisch
that opportunity.

797
01:09:24,844 --> 01:09:27,346
Even if there was enough proof,

798
01:09:28,014 --> 01:09:31,516
he, like us, would probably die

799
01:09:31,643 --> 01:09:34,728
before he could be extradited to Germany.

800
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:41,944
We have agreed
that Otto Wallisch must die.

801
01:09:43,321 --> 01:09:46,281
You must kill him.

802
01:09:46,741 --> 01:09:51,370
"You promised to go once Ruth died.

803
01:09:51,871 --> 01:09:55,832
"You promised me and you promised Ruth."

804
01:09:59,879 --> 01:10:01,880
You did a very good job.

805
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:04,466
Thanks.

806
01:10:06,552 --> 01:10:07,719
Who's Ruth?

807
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:09,638
My wife.

808
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,724
I thought she was bringing me candy.

809
01:10:13,768 --> 01:10:15,477
I thought so, too.

810
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,612
Yes, I need to go to Holiday Inn Express

811
01:10:26,406 --> 01:10:28,865
3961 Lake Tahoe Boulevard.

812
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:30,909
- South Lake?
- Yeah.

813
01:10:31,035 --> 01:10:32,911
That's over an hour away.

814
01:10:33,037 --> 01:10:37,624
- Oh, that's... I have money.
- Hop in.

815
01:10:57,645 --> 01:11:00,605
- Hello. Zev?
- Yeah.

816
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:04,534
Thank God.

817
01:11:04,944 --> 01:11:06,361
Where are you?

818
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:10,073
Zev?

819
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,950
Tahoe.

820
01:11:12,952 --> 01:11:16,663
You understand what you must do?

821
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:19,875
There's only one left.

822
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,712
Yeah, I understand...

823
01:11:26,466 --> 01:11:27,716
what I must do.

824
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,017
- Morning.
- Good morning.

825
01:11:37,143 --> 01:11:38,977
I'd like to check out, please.

826
01:11:40,605 --> 01:11:41,605
Thank you.

827
01:11:42,815 --> 01:11:45,400
- You hurt your hand?
- Oh, yes, yes.

828
01:11:45,526 --> 01:11:47,903
- It's... Well, I can move.
- Good.

829
01:11:48,863 --> 01:11:51,698
Okay, that'll be $106.20.

830
01:11:52,992 --> 01:11:56,453
I think I will have enough money
for the taxi.

831
01:11:58,706 --> 01:12:01,500
Oh, uh, we take credit cards, too.

832
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:03,126
Yeah.

833
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,670
Thank you.

834
01:12:07,173 --> 01:12:10,467
Tahoe? What the heck is he doing in Tahoe?

835
01:12:11,552 --> 01:12:15,847
No, I'm just picking up a rental now
and I guess I'll just drive up there.

836
01:12:15,973 --> 01:12:16,890
Yeah.

837
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:20,769
Oh, look, can you try and find the name
of the taxi company that picked him up?

838
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:23,522
Thank you.

839
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:16,775
Can I help you?

840
01:13:17,577 --> 01:13:20,245
Rudy Kurlander, he lives here?

841
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:23,665
- Yes.
- Can I speak with him?

842
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:26,668
- He's still sleeping.
- Oh.

843
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:31,089
Well, could I wait for him to... wake up?

844
01:13:32,091 --> 01:13:33,550
It's important.

845
01:13:34,635 --> 01:13:35,760
What's this about?

846
01:13:35,887 --> 01:13:37,971
Well, it's private.

847
01:13:38,097 --> 01:13:41,141
And he knows me, he knows me.
I knew him a long time ago.

848
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:46,605
- Come on in.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

849
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:52,694
- Do you want a cup of coffee, Mr...
- Guttman.

850
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:55,614
Yes, coffee would be nice. Thank you.

851
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,534
- Uh, just black.
- Take a seat in the living room.

852
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:00,952
I've got a pot brewing.

853
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:17,886
That's from our family reunion
a couple years ago.

854
01:14:18,971 --> 01:14:20,430
Oh.

855
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:22,265
You have a big family.

856
01:14:23,017 --> 01:14:26,010
My father likes to say
he fielded a soccer team.

857
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:27,520
I'm his youngest.

858
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,189
How old was your mother?

859
01:14:29,815 --> 01:14:31,983
She was a lot younger.
It was his second marriage.

860
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:36,655
- Thank you.
- Can I ask you a question, Mr. Guttman?

861
01:14:38,157 --> 01:14:40,283
Does you being here
have to do with Auschwitz?

862
01:14:42,203 --> 01:14:43,203
Yes.

863
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,915
My father's not gonna want
to talk about that.

864
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,333
Oh.

865
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:51,169
I understand.

866
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,840
Would you like to join us
for breakfast, Mr. Guttman?

867
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:57,217
I'm making baked apple pancakes.

868
01:14:57,343 --> 01:14:59,678
I'm not very hungry. Thank you very much.

869
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,347
I won't bother you for long.

870
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,933
Are you sure? It's an old family recipe.

871
01:15:05,059 --> 01:15:08,853
Mmm. Yes, I am sure,
but thank you just the same.

872
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:12,065
If you'd excuse me, I am just going
to run up and tell Dad you're here.

873
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:13,608
Yeah, yeah.

874
01:15:34,714 --> 01:15:36,006
Uh, who are you?

875
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:38,591
Oh, I am Zev.

876
01:15:38,718 --> 01:15:40,010
- Hi, Zev.
- Inge.

877
01:15:45,391 --> 01:15:46,391
Who is that?

878
01:15:47,393 --> 01:15:51,187
Well, it's an old friend
of your grandfather.

879
01:16:46,827 --> 01:16:48,078
You like Wagner?

880
01:16:50,956 --> 01:16:55,043
Yes. I have always loved Wagner.

881
01:16:56,003 --> 01:17:00,465
My daughter said someone I knew
from Auschwitz was here.

882
01:17:02,176 --> 01:17:05,203
But a survivor should not like Wagner, no?

883
01:17:06,019 --> 01:17:08,735
You can't hate music.

884
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:14,312
I, uh, didn't recognize your face
in those pictures.

885
01:17:15,815 --> 01:17:16,815
But...

886
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:24,072
Your voice...

887
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:29,828
has not changed.

888
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:37,836
I knew you would come to find me one day.

889
01:17:39,213 --> 01:17:40,505
Zev's your friend, Poppy?

890
01:17:41,132 --> 01:17:43,341
Inge, please go back into the kitchen.

891
01:17:44,343 --> 01:17:47,178
My friend and I need
to discuss some things.

892
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:52,475
I have not forgotten you.

893
01:17:53,519 --> 01:17:56,187
Please... let us go outside.

894
01:17:57,481 --> 01:18:01,151
I do not want my family to hear...
what we have to say.

895
01:18:07,366 --> 01:18:08,908
It has been a long time...

896
01:18:10,494 --> 01:18:13,037
since anyone knew who I was.

897
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:17,459
I cannot even remember when.

898
01:18:20,546 --> 01:18:24,382
Over the years people have looked at me

899
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:29,888
and I think they know, but they never do.

900
01:18:32,224 --> 01:18:37,020
Or maybe they were just
too scared to say anything.

901
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:45,403
Sometimes, I come out here
and speak my name.

902
01:18:48,407 --> 01:18:50,241
I talk to myself.

903
01:18:51,577 --> 01:18:54,204
I remind myself of who I was.

904
01:18:57,458 --> 01:19:01,419
It is the only way to know I existed...

905
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:05,840
before I became who I am now.

906
01:19:07,384 --> 01:19:13,306
Well, living a lie is not a life.

907
01:19:16,101 --> 01:19:18,937
I always knew you would find me.

908
01:19:24,944 --> 01:19:26,402
It has been too long.

909
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,072
We are old men now.

910
01:19:30,449 --> 01:19:35,119
Take your hands off of me, Otto.

911
01:19:37,957 --> 01:19:38,915
Excuse me?

912
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:42,168
I said, "Take your hands off of me."

913
01:19:46,046 --> 01:19:49,217
You called me Otto. I
think you're confused.

914
01:19:49,343 --> 01:19:53,346
No, your name is Otto Wallisch.

915
01:19:53,472 --> 01:19:57,141
You were a Blockführer at Auschwitz.

916
01:19:57,601 --> 01:20:01,104
And you killed my family.

917
01:20:03,274 --> 01:20:04,482
Are you crazy?

918
01:20:07,111 --> 01:20:12,448
You've lived a lie for so long
you've convinced yourself it is true.

919
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,076
I...

920
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:19,205
I do not understand.

921
01:20:19,331 --> 01:20:20,373
Let me help you...

922
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:24,252
understand.

923
01:20:34,388 --> 01:20:36,306
It's like we're running a hotel.

924
01:20:38,058 --> 01:20:40,101
Go tell Pop-Pop breakfast is ready.

925
01:20:43,981 --> 01:20:45,815
- Who is it?
- My name's Charles Guttman.

926
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,692
I think my father's here.

927
01:20:48,193 --> 01:20:50,570
Hi, I'm so sorry to bother you,

928
01:20:50,696 --> 01:20:54,907
but I was told that a taxi dropped
my dad off here a little while ago.

929
01:20:55,034 --> 01:20:57,076
Yeah, he's outside with my father.

930
01:20:58,537 --> 01:20:59,937
Thank God.

931
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:03,944
He's been missing for a week.

932
01:21:04,043 --> 01:21:05,168
Missing?

933
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:09,714
- I had no idea. Come on.
- Thank you.

934
01:21:22,353 --> 01:21:24,270
- Dad?
- Oh, my God.

935
01:21:24,396 --> 01:21:27,190
- Mommy?
- Please do not be frightened.

936
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:28,316
Don't be scared.

937
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:32,570
Dad, why don't you, uh, lower the gun?

938
01:21:33,739 --> 01:21:35,198
- Charles?
- Yeah.

939
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:38,242
- What are you doing here?
- Uh...

940
01:21:39,244 --> 01:21:40,745
Dad, put the gun down.

941
01:21:41,413 --> 01:21:44,499
- Put down the gun, Dad.
- No. No.

942
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,251
Not until he tells the truth.

943
01:21:50,381 --> 01:21:51,756
Why are you doing this?

944
01:21:52,466 --> 01:21:54,342
Tell them who you are.

945
01:21:54,468 --> 01:21:57,136
Please, stop this madness.

946
01:21:57,262 --> 01:21:59,597
Tell them what you did.

947
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:02,475
- Leave them alone, please.
- English!

948
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:03,643
I beg you.

949
01:22:04,144 --> 01:22:06,270
I want them to understand
what you're saying.

950
01:22:06,772 --> 01:22:08,356
Dad, what is he talking about?

951
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,776
Do not listen to him. He is crazy!

952
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:13,778
Ach so?

953
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,324
You have a very easy choice.

954
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:21,369
You can tell the truth and she lives,

955
01:22:21,495 --> 01:22:24,163
or you can lie and watch her die.

956
01:22:24,289 --> 01:22:25,248
You have three seconds.

957
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:26,332
- One.
- Please stop.

958
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:28,251
- Two.
- Please, just shoot me.

959
01:22:28,377 --> 01:22:29,335
- Dad, stop it!
- Three.

960
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:30,503
Okay. Okay.

961
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:33,689
Okay.

962
01:22:42,474 --> 01:22:44,809
During the war,

963
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,271
I was not a prisoner.

964
01:22:48,814 --> 01:22:49,814
Louder.

965
01:22:52,484 --> 01:22:54,777
- During the war I was not a prisoner.
- Louder!

966
01:22:56,155 --> 01:22:58,823
During the war I was not a prisoner!

967
01:23:09,168 --> 01:23:10,501
I was a Nazi.

968
01:23:14,214 --> 01:23:15,548
I was SS.

969
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:19,385
I was a Blockführer at Auschwitz.

970
01:23:20,846 --> 01:23:22,513
Did you kill people?

971
01:23:23,682 --> 01:23:24,682
Yes.

972
01:23:25,559 --> 01:23:30,354
- You killed people, Poppy?
- How many people did you kill?

973
01:23:31,398 --> 01:23:32,398
I don't know.

974
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:34,609
Many.

975
01:23:37,446 --> 01:23:40,531
And now tell them your real name.

976
01:23:47,748 --> 01:23:49,373
My name is...

977
01:23:52,419 --> 01:23:53,836
Kunibert Sturm.

978
01:23:54,838 --> 01:23:55,838
No.

979
01:23:56,715 --> 01:23:59,008
Your name is Wallisch!

980
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,469
No, it's Kunibert Sturm.

981
01:24:01,595 --> 01:24:04,096
You are Otto Wallisch!

982
01:24:04,223 --> 01:24:05,431
No.

983
01:24:06,725 --> 01:24:10,812
You! You are Otto Wallisch!

984
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,192
You're lying.

985
01:24:17,361 --> 01:24:18,611
No.

986
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:24,534
It's the first time
I haven't lied in 70 years.

987
01:24:26,286 --> 01:24:28,746
You are Otto Wallisch.

988
01:24:30,332 --> 01:24:34,502
I am Kunibert Sturm.
We were both Blockführers.

989
01:24:35,629 --> 01:24:37,637
No...

990
01:24:38,257 --> 01:24:39,549
I was a prisoner.

991
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:41,592
Look at your arm.

992
01:24:42,553 --> 01:24:47,223
You are number 98814. I am 98813.

993
01:24:49,226 --> 01:24:54,647
We tattooed each other.
It was our only way to escape.

994
01:25:10,831 --> 01:25:11,914
Dad?

995
01:25:13,792 --> 01:25:14,917
Is that true?

996
01:25:15,669 --> 01:25:19,255
No, it's all lies. It's all lies.

997
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,426
- It's not true.
- Lies?

998
01:25:26,638 --> 01:25:28,222
How could you forget?

999
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:32,560
You took the name Zev
because it means wolf.

1000
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:36,981
You said we were wolves!

1001
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:49,285
Oh, my God.

1002
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,675
I remember.

1003
01:26:08,472 --> 01:26:09,472
Dad?

1004
01:26:12,434 --> 01:26:13,476
Dad!

1005
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,358
Right now, we're still waiting to hear
from the Lake Tahoe Police Department.

1006
01:26:20,484 --> 01:26:23,653
They haven't spoken to reporters
or released a statement just yet.

1007
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:26,781
But they have assured us
that we will hear from them in some way

1008
01:26:26,907 --> 01:26:27,907
within the hour.

1009
01:26:28,033 --> 01:26:31,619
Residents, though, are,
as you can imagine, just stunned.

1010
01:26:31,745 --> 01:26:35,331
I've spoken to some people
who do not want to comment on camera.

1011
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:38,250
I did speak to one,
though, who told me that...

1012
01:26:38,377 --> 01:26:42,713
- Poor Zev.
- Tragic. Absolutely tragic.

1013
01:26:42,839 --> 01:26:45,383
He couldn't have known what he was doing.

1014
01:26:49,596 --> 01:26:52,431
He knew exactly what he was doing.

1015
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,560
What? What are you talking about, Max?

1016
01:27:00,983 --> 01:27:03,401
The man he killed

1017
01:27:04,528 --> 01:27:09,073
was named Kunibert Sturm.

1018
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:13,744
And Zev's name

1019
01:27:16,415 --> 01:27:19,625
was Otto Wallisch.

1020
01:27:23,422 --> 01:27:25,339
They were the men who...

1021
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:30,553
murdered my family.

1021
01:27:31,305 --> 01:28:31,435
