00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,709
It is an extremely
common mistake,

3
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,083
people think the writer's
imagination is always at work,

4
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,916
that he's constantly
inventing an endless supply

5
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,092
of incidents and episodes,

6
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:09,968
that he simply dreams up
his stories out of thin air.

7
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,846
In point of fact,
the opposite is true.

8
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,018
Once the public
knows you're a writer,

9
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,892
they bring the characters
and events to you

10
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,770
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look

11
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,318
and to carefully listen,

12
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,112
these stories
will continue to...

13
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,907
Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!

14
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:38,576
Uh, will continue to seek
you out over your lifetime.

15
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:42,129
To him who has often
told the tales of others,

16
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,956
many tales will be told.

17
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,916
Sorry.
It's all right.

18
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:49,173
The incidents that follow
were described to me

19
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,382
exactly as I present them here

20
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,967
and in a wholly unexpected way.

21
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,774
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

22
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,854
<i>while suffering from a mild
case of "Scribe's Fever,"</i>

23
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,860
<i>a form of neurasthenia
common among</i>

24
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,778
<i>the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

25
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>I decided to spend
the month of August</i>

26
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,993
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

27
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,542
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

28
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:25,589
<i>a picturesque, elaborate, and once
widely celebrated establishment.</i>

29
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,338
<i>I expect some of
you will know it.</i>

30
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,339
<i>It was off season and, by
that time, decidedly out of fashion,</i>

31
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,470
<i>and it had already
begun its descent</i>

32
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,679
<i>into shabbiness and
eventual demolition.</i>

33
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,604
<i>What few guests we were</i>

34
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,149
<i>had quickly come to recognize
one another by sight</i>

35
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,398
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

36
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,649
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

37
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,736
<i>beyond the polite nods
we exchanged as we passed</i>

38
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:55,819
<i>in the Palm Court,</i>

39
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,870
<i>in the Arabian baths,</i>

40
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,244
<i>and on board
the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

41
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,328
<i>We were a very reserved
group, it seemed,</i>

42
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,004
<i>and, without exception,
solitary.</i>

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,132
<i>Perhaps as a result of
this general silence,</i>

44
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,135
<i>I had established a casual
and bantering familiarity</i>

45
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,341
<i>with the hotel's concierge,
a West-continental</i>

46
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,552
<i>known only as Monsieur Jean,</i>

47
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,604
<i>who struck one
as being, at once,</i>

48
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,933
<i>both lazy and, really,
quite accommodating.</i>

49
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,318
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

50
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,940
<i>In any case, one evening,</i>

51
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,614
<i>as I stood conferring
elbow-to-elbow with Monsieur Jean,</i>

52
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:37,160
<i>as had become my habit, I noticed
a new presence in our company.</i>

53
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,738
<i>A small, elderly man,
smartly dressed,</i>

54
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,870
<i>with an exceptionally lively,
intelligent face</i>

55
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,078
<i>and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness.</i>

56
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,665
<i>He was, like the rest of us,
alone, but also, I must say,</i>

57
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:54,424
<i>he was the first that struck one
as being deeply and truly lonely.</i>

58
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,302
<i>A symptom of my own
medical condition as well.</i>

59
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,383
Who's this interesting
old fellow?

60
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,184
<i>I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i>

61
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,012
<i>To my surprise,
he was distinctly taken aback.</i>

62
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,473
Don't you know?
<i>He asked.</i>

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,432
Don't you recognize him?

64
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,018
<i>He did look familiar.</i>

65
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,320
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.

66
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,941
He arrived earlier this morning.

67
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,361
<i>This name will no
doubt be familiar</i>

68
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,235
<i>to the more seasoned
persons among you.</i>

69
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,913
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka,</i>

70
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,255
<i>and was still indeed the owner
of the Grand Budapest.</i>

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,417
He often comes and
stays a week or more,

72
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,753
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

73
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,305
<i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me
and I leaned closer.</i>

74
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,552
I'll tell you a secret.

75
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,100
He takes only a single-bed
sleeping room without a bath

76
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,052
in the rear corner
of the top floor

77
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,184
and it's smaller than
the service elevator!

78
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,731
<i>It was well known,</i>

79
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,476
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

80
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,608
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent.</i>

81
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,115
<i>Yet here, in his own
nearly empty hotel,</i>

82
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,818
<i>he occupied
a servant's quarters?</i>

83
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,695
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose</i>

84
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,288
<i>on a parenthetical,
domestic drama...</i>

85
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,660
Shit.

86
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,744
<i>...which required the immediate
and complete attention</i>

87
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,919
<i>of Monsieur Jean,</i>

88
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,132
<i>but, frankly,
did not hold mine for long.</i>

89
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,424
<i>However,</i>

90
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,260
<i>this premature intermission in the
story of the curious, old man</i>

91
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,891
<i>had left me,
as the expression goes,</i>

92
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,224
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen,"

93
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,730
<i>that is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

94
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,813
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning, until,</i>

95
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,776
<i>in what I have found to be its
mysterious and utterly reliable fashion,</i>

96
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,863
<i>fate, once again,
intervened on my behalf.</i>

97
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,784
I admire your work.

98
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,422
I beg your pardon?

99
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,296
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

100
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,094
Thank you most kindly, sir.

101
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,554
Did <i>Monsieur</i> Jean have a word
or two to share with you

102
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,355
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

103
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:14,067
I must confess, I did
myself inquire about you.

104
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,861
He's perfectly capable,
of course, <i>Monsieur</i> Jean

105
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,814
but we can't claim he's a first,

106
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,696
or, in earnest,
even second-rate concierge.

107
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,027
But there it is.

108
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,742
Times have changed.

109
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,956
The thermal baths
are very beautiful.

110
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,707
They were in their
first condition.

111
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,463
It couldn't be maintained,
of course.

112
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,374
Too decadent for current tastes.

113
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:42,258
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

114
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,887
How did you come to
buy it, if I may ask?

115
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,093
The Grand Budapest.

116
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,853
I didn't.

117
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,331
If you're not
merely being polite,

118
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,251
and you must tell me
if that's the case,

119
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:16,455
but if it genuinely
does interest you,

120
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,007
may I invite you to
dine with me tonight,

121
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,011
and it will be my pleasure and,
indeed, my privilege to tell you

122
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,636
"my story."
Such as it is.

123
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,810
Two ducks roasted with olives.

124
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,393
Rabbit, salad?
Mmm.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,319
Pouilly-Jouvet '52,
plus a split of the brut.

126
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,650
That should
provide us ample time

127
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,950
if I commence promptly.

128
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,159
By all means.

129
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:12,520
Well, it begins, as it must, with
our mutual friend's predecessor.

130
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,939
The beloved, original concierge
of The Grand Budapest.

131
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,401
It begins, of course, with...

132
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,876
Bring the table to the window.
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

133
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,553
Bring the tray to the table.
Right away, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

134
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,097
Right there. Have those
been brushed and blocked?

135
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,095
Of course, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.
Pack them in the hat boxes.

136
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,495
Is that from
Oberstdorf & Company?

137
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,476
I believe so, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

138
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,349
Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
I do, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

139
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
Give them to me.

140
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,601
These are in order.
Wait in the corner.

141
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,943
I'm not leaving.

142
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,194
I beg your pardon?

143
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,404
I'm not leaving.
Why not?

144
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,536
I'm frightened.
Of what?

145
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,941
I fear this may be the last
time we ever see each other.

146
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,623
Why on earth would
that be the case?

147
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,047
Well, I can't put it
into words, but I feel it.

148
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,499
For goodness sake,
there's no reason

149
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,863
for you to leave us if you'd...

150
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,467
Come with me.

151
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,052
To fucking Lutz?

152
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,347
Please.
Give me your hand.

153
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,477
You've nothing to fear. You're
always anxious before you travel.

154
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,974
I admit, you appear
to be suffering

155
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,535
a more acute attack
on this occasion.

156
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,977
But, truly and honestly...
Oh, dear God.

157
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,520
What have you done
to your fingernails?

158
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,442
I beg your pardon? This
diabolical varnish.

159
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,528
The color is completely wrong.
Don't you like it?

160
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,527
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

161
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,075
Perhaps this will soothe you.

162
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,827
What? Don't recite.

163
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,227
Just listen to
the words. Hush.

164
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,329
Please. Not now.

165
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,414
"While questing once in noble
wood of gray, medieval pine,

166
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,793
"I came upon a tomb, rain-slick'd,
rubbed-cool, ethereal,

167
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,749
'its inscription
long-vanished,

168
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,380
yet still within its
melancholy fissures..."

169
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,462
Will you light
a candle for me, please?

170
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,056
In the sacristy of Santa Maria?

171
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,934
I'll see to it
myself immediately.

172
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,018
Remember, I'm always with you.

173
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,269
I love you.

174
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,729
I love you.

175
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,823
It's quite a thing winning the
loyalty of a woman like that

176
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,033
for 19 consecutive seasons.

177
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,202
Um... Yes, sir.

178
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,170
She's very fond of me, you know.

179
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,330
Yes, sir.

180
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,461
But I've never seen
her like that before.

181
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,666
No, sir.

182
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,128
She was shaking
like a shitting dog.

183
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,546
Truly.

184
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,136
Run to the cathedral of Santa
Maria in Brucknerplatz.

185
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,059
Buy one of the plain,
half-length candles

186
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,614
and take back four
Klubecks in change.

187
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,600
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary

188
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,932
then go to Mendi's and get me
a <i>courtesan au chocolat.</i>

189
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,740
If there's any money left, give it
to the crippled shoe-shine boy.

190
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,479
Right away, sir.

191
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,605
Hold it.

192
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,655
Who are you?

193
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,528
I'm Zero, sir.
The new Lobby Boy.

194
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,953
Zero, you say?
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,406
I've never heard of you,
never laid eyes on you.

196
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,490
Who hired you?

197
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,824
Mr. Mosher, sir.

198
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,117
Mr. Mosher!

199
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,457
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

200
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,290
Am I to understand you've
surreptitiously hired this young man

201
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:29,670
in the position of a Lobby Boy?

202
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,626
He's been engaged
for a trial period,

203
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,469
pending your approval,
of course.

204
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:34,841
Uh...

205
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,341
Perhaps, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

206
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,809
You're most welcome,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

207
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,683
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

208
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,060
Should I go and light
the candle first, sir?

209
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,517
What? No.

210
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,317
Experience?

211
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,649
Hotel Kinski,
Kitchen Boy, six months.

212
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,029
Hotel Berlitz, Mop and
Broom Boy, three months.

213
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,577
Before that I was
a Skillet Scrubber...

214
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,037
Experience, zero.

215
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,113
Thank you again,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

216
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,197
Straighten that cap, Anatole.

217
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,158
The pleasure's mine, <i>Herr</i> Schneider.
The strap's busted.

218
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,118
These are not acceptable.
I fully agree.

219
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,544
Education?

220
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,913
I studied reading and spelling.

221
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,374
I started my primary school.
I almost...

222
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,582
Education, zero.

223
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,755
Now it's exploded.

224
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,003
Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber!

225
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,366
This afternoon,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

226
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,505
Without fail, <i>Frau</i> Liebling.

227
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,181
What in hell is this? Not now.

228
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,342
Family?

229
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,604
Zero.

230
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
Six, Igor.

231
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,074
Why do you want
to be a Lobby Boy?

232
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,539
Well, who wouldn't,
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

233
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,742
It's an institution.

234
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,212
Very good.

235
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,517
A thousand Klubecks.

236
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,684
My goodness.

237
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,726
Were you ever a Lobby Boy, sir?

238
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:12,935
What do you think?

239
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,067
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere...

240
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,944
Go and light the goddamn candle.
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,155
<i>And so, my life began.</i>

242
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,288
<i>Junior Lobby Boy in-training,</i>

243
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,915
<i>Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

244
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,293
<i>under the strict command
of Monsieur Gustave H.</i>

245
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,627
<i>I became his pupil, and he was
to be my counselor and guardian.</i>

246
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,552
<i>What is a Lobby Boy?</i>

247
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:42,132
<i>A Lobby Boy's completely
invisible, yet always in sight.</i>

248
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,384
<i>A Lobby Boy remembers
what people hate.</i>

249
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,390
<i>A Lobby Boy anticipates
the client's needs</i>

250
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,688
<i>before the needs are needed.</i>

251
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,983
<i>A Lobby Boy is, above all,
discreet to a fault.</i>

252
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:54,277
Our guests know
their deepest secrets,

253
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,945
some of which are,
frankly, rather unseemly,

254
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,863
will go with us to our graves.

255
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,316
So keep your mouth shut, Zero.

256
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,692
Yes, sir.

257
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,787
That's all for now.

258
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,910
<i>I began to realize
that many of the hotel's</i>

259
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,836
<i>most valued and distinguished
guests came for him.</i>

260
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,662
<i>It seemed to be an essential
pan' of his duties...</i>

261
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,088
Ah!

262
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,416
<i>...but I believe it
was also his pleasure.</i>

263
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,469
<i>The requirements
were always the same.</i>

264
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,139
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

265
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,431
<i>old,</i>

266
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,804
<i>insecure,</i>

267
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,055
<i>vain,</i>

268
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,512
<i>superficial,</i>

269
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,811
<i>blonde,</i>

270
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,514
<i>needy.</i>

271
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,725
Why blonde?

272
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,150
Because they all were.

273
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,735
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

274
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,534
<i>the most liberally perfumed
man I had ever encountered.</i>

275
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,578
<i>The scent announced his
approach from a great distance</i>

276
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,575
<i>and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone.</i>

277
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,459
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

278
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,916
<i>5:00 AM until
just after midnight.</i>

279
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,677
<i>Our meals were small but
frequent, for stamina.</i>

280
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,677
<i>Two breakfasts, two lunches
and a late supper.</i>

281
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,094
<i>Monsieur Gustave also
delivered a nightly sermon.</i>

282
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,397
Rudeness is merely
the expression of fear.

283
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,816
People fear they
won't get what they want.

284
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,520
The most dreadful and unattractive
person only needs to be loved,

285
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,151
and they will open
up like a flower.

286
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,948
I am reminded of a verse,

287
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,572
"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face

288
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,744
by ends of nimble bristles

289
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,822
and with their
blush of first color,

290
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,824
rendered her
lifeless cheek living."

291
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,082
<i>His own dinner,
he took alone in his room.</i>

292
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,466
<i>The identity of the owner of the
hotel was unknown to all of us.</i>

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,470
<i>Each month, his emissary, known
as Deputy Kovacs, arrived</i>

294
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,517
<i>to review the books
and convey messages</i>

295
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,221
<i>on behalf of
the mysterious proprietor.</i>

296
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,399
<i>On these occasions, Monsieur
Gustave and our business manager,</i>

297
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,103
<i>Herr Becker, met with him in private
consultation above Reception.</i>

298
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,376
<i>This was also when I met Agatha,</i>

299
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,555
<i>but we won't discuss that.</i>

300
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,481
What do you want?
Look.

301
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,742
Dear God.

302
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,202
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

303
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,407
We must go to her.

304
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,491
We must?

305
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,335
<i>Tout de suite.</i>
She needs me, and I need

306
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,170
you to help me with
my bags and so on.

307
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,840
How fast can you pack?
Five minutes.

308
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,041
Do it. And bring a bottle
of the Pouilly-Jouvet '26

309
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,364
in an ice bucket
with two glasses

310
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,347
so we don't have to drink the cat
piss they serve in the dining car.

311
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,517
I blame myself.

312
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,567
She tried to tell me she had a premonition.
I didn't listen.

313
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,364
All of Lutz will
be dressed in black,

314
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,487
except her own ghastly,
deceitful children

315
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,739
whom she loathed and
couldn't bear to kiss hello.

316
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,241
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

317
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,334
There's really no point
in doing anything in life,

318
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,286
because it's all over
in the blink of an eye...

319
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,381
And, the next thing you know,
rigor mortis sets in.

320
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,425
Oh, how the good die young.

321
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,596
With any luck, she's left a few
Klubecks for your old friend,

322
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,347
but one never knows
until the ink

323
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,057
is dry on the death certificate.

324
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,393
She was dynamite in the sack,
by the way.

325
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,773
She was 84, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

326
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,434
I've had older.

327
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,227
When you're young,
it's all fillet steak,

328
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,439
but as the years go by, you have
to move on to the cheaper cuts,

329
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,903
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

330
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,361
More flavorful, or so they say.

331
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,740
Why are we stopping
at a barley field?

332
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,682
Well, hello there, chaps.

333
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,309
Documents, please.

334
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,511
With pleasure.

335
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,478
It's not a very flattering
portrait, I'm afraid.

336
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,311
I was once considered
a great beauty.

337
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,989
What does the "F" stand for?
Fritz? Franz?

338
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,441
Franz.

339
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,783
I knew it!

340
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,029
He's making a funny face.

341
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,829
That's a Migratory Visa with Stage
Three Worker Status, Franz, darling.

342
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:44,119
He's with me.

343
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,999
Come outside, please.

344
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,466
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

345
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,134
I cross-referenced
them myself with

346
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,673
the Bureau of
Labor and Servitude.

347
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,721
You can't arrest him simply
because he's a bloody immigrant.

348
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,011
He hasn't done anything wrong.

349
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,560
Stop it, damn you!

350
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,854
Never mind, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave!
Let them proceed!

351
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,685
Ow! That hurts!

352
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,320
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

353
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,822
Take your hands
off my Lobby Boy!

354
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,048
What's the problem?

355
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,299
This is outrageous.

356
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,055
The young man works for me at the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

357
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,389
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

358
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,219
My name is Henckels.

359
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,602
I'm the son of Dr. and Mrs.
Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer.

360
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,566
Do you remember me?

361
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,234
I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny.
You're little Albert.

362
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,239
I'm terribly embarrassed.
Release them.

363
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,235
Release them.

364
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,241
Hmm.

365
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,285
Your colleague is stateless.

366
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,776
He'll need to apply for a
revised Special Transit Permit,

367
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,254
which at this point may be
very difficult to acquire.

368
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,416
Take this.

369
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,462
It's temporary

370
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:18,967
but it's the best
I can offer, I'm afraid.

371
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,219
And how's your wonderful mother?

372
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,346
She's very well, thank you.
I adore her.

373
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,723
Send my love.
I will.

374
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,480
Your companion
was very kind to me

375
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,474
when I was a lonely little boy.

376
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,982
My men and I apologize
for disturbing you.

377
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,230
I beg your pardon, sir.

378
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,800
You see? There are still faint
glimmers of civilization

379
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,798
left in this barbaric
slaughterhouse

380
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,670
that was once known as humanity.

381
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,297
Indeed, that's what we provide

382
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,179
in our own modest,
humble, insignificant...

383
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,678
Oh, fuck it.

384
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,800
Where is she, Clotilde?
Take me to her.

385
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,375
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

386
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,926
They've done a marvelous job.

387
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,408
I don't know what sort of cream

388
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,545
they've put on you
down at the morgue,

389
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,051
but I want some.

390
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,508
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

391
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,718
You look like you're alive.

392
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,237
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

393
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,234
Clotilde?
<i>Oui, Monsieur</i> Gustave?

394
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,445
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

395
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,949
Yes, M. Gustave...

396
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,345
...and, also, M. Serge would like to speak with you
privately in his office, please.

397
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,330
Oh.

398
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,416
All right, then.

399
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,618
I shan't be long, darling.

400
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,917
<i>We were escorted
through a green baize door,</i>

401
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,459
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

402
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,472
<i>A moment later,
the kitchen passage swung open</i>

403
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,933
<i>and a small servant dressed in
white jolted into the room.</i>

404
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,103
<i>I've never forgotten
the look on that man's face.</i>

405
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,931
What the devil is going on?

406
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,355
<i>I, myself,
had never set foot inside</i>

407
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,273
<i>a house of this kind in my life.</i>

408
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:24,232
<i>I understood very little about
the events that were to follow.</i>

409
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,410
<i>But, eventually,
I came to recognize,</i>

410
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,113
<i>when the destiny of a great
fortune is at stake,</i>

411
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,076
<i>men's greed spreads like a
poison in the bloodstream.</i>

412
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,585
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

413
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,417
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

414
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,127
<i>The old woman's
most distant relations</i>

415
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,463
<i>had come foraging
out of the woodwork.</i>

416
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,091
<i>At the head of
this congregation,</i>

417
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,264
<i>it was
a disorienting coincidence,</i>

418
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,188
<i>we discovered our
own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

419
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,149
<i>himself an important attorney,
of course.</i>

420
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,694
<i>He was the executor
of the dead widow's estate.</i>

421
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,530
This is Madame D's
last will and testament.

422
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,824
It consists of a general tontine

423
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,871
drawn up before the event of her
husband's death 46 years ago,

424
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,294
in combination
with 635 amendments,

425
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,173
notations, corrections,
and letters of wishes

426
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,471
executed during
the subsequent decades.

427
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,467
The ultimate legality
of this accumulation

428
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,847
requires further analysis,

429
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,059
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

430
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,182
that control of the
vast bulk of her estate

431
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:43,023
should be transferred,
forthwith, to her son, Dmitri,

432
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,855
with special allowances
for his sisters,

433
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,486
Marguerite, Laetizia,
and Carolina,

434
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,694
and minor gifts for various
members of the extended family

435
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,620
as shown in
the List of Recipients,

436
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,410
which I will elucidate
in due course.

437
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,867
However.

438
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,709
An additional codicil,

439
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:07,217
delivered into my possession
by post only this morning,

440
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,754
and, by all indications,
sent by Madame D

441
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,324
during the last
hours of her life,

442
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,008
contains an amendment
to the original certificate,

443
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,221
which, as prescribed by law,
I will read to you now.

444
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,667
The authenticity
of this document

445
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,882
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

446
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,066
so I ask that all parties be
patient and refrain from comment

447
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,570
until such time as our
investigations can be completed.

448
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,752
"To my esteemed friend who
comforted me in my later years

449
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,254
and brought sunshine
into the life of an old woman

450
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:47,253
who thought that she
would never be happy again."

451
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,293
<i>"Monsieur</i> Gustave H,

452
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,430
I bequeath, bestow and
devise, free of all taxation

453
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,433
and with full and absolute
fiduciary entitlement,

454
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,099
the painting known
as <i>'Boy with Apple...'</i>"

455
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,979
Wow!
"...by Johannes van Hoytl..."

456
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,741
I can't believe it.
"...the younger..."

457
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:03,890
What?

458
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,142
"...which gave us
both so much pleasure."

459
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,268
The van Hoytl?

460
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,477
Tax-free?
Can she do that?

461
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,730
Who's Gustave H?

462
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,612
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

463
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,287
That fucking faggot!

464
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,949
He's a concierge.
What are you doing here?

465
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,119
I've come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom I loved.

466
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,912
This man is an intruder
in my home!

467
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,584
It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

468
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,023
Only when probate is granted,
and the Deed of Entitlement...

469
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,484
You're not getting <i>Boy with
Apple,</i> you goddamn little fruit!

470
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,301
How's that supposed
to make me feel?

471
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,512
Call the police.
We're pressing charges.

472
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,762
This criminal has plagued my
family for nearly 20 years.

473
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,937
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con-artist

474
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,141
who preys on mentally feeble,
sick old ladies,

475
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,443
and he probably fucks them, too!

476
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:49,771
I go to bed with all my friends.

477
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,327
Where's Céline?

478
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,912
What?

479
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,039
She's dead.
We're reading her will.

480
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,504
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

481
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:10,548
If I learn you ever once laid
a finger on my mother's body,

482
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,384
living or dead, I swear to God,

483
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,128
I'll cut your throat!
You hear me?

484
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,464
I thought I was supposed
to be a fucking faggot.

485
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,764
You are, but you're bisexual.

486
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,134
Let's change the subject.

487
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:21,389
I'm leaving.

488
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,273
Wait here quietly. please.

489
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,697
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
is priceless. Understand?

490
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,399
Congratulations,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave!

491
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,367
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

492
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,659
Is it very beautiful?

493
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,869
Beyond description.

494
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,539
"E'en the most gifted bard's
rhyme can only sing

495
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,746
but to the lack of her
and all she isn't!"

496
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,370
"His tongue doth..."
Can I see it?

497
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,579
I don't see why not.

498
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,617
This is van Hoytl's
exquisite portrayal

499
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,083
of a beautiful boy
on the cusp of manhood.

500
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,915
Blond, smooth. Skin as
white as that milk.

501
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,462
Of impeccable provenance.

502
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:34,208
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably, the best.

503
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,713
It's a masterpiece.

504
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,965
The rest of this shit
is worthless junk.

505
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,973
<i>M. Gustave?</i>

506
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,147
Can I help you?

507
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,015
Yes. Serge.

508
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,939
You can wrap this up. please.

509
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,310
Wrap up...

510
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,984
Wrap up... "Boy With Apple"?

511
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,509
What did you want
to tell me, before?

512
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,838
I think I cannot say right now.

513
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,344
Write me tomorrow.
Lutzbahn Station!

514
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,312
I'll never part with it.

515
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:23,901
It reminded her of me. It will
remind me of her. Always.

516
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,825
I'll die with this
picture above my bed.

517
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,030
See the resemblance?

518
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,033
Oh, yes.

519
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,090
Actually, we should sell it.

520
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,336
Sooner rather than later, in
case they try to steal it back.

521
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,905
Plus, something about
those lunatic

522
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,259
foot-soldiers
on the express...

523
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,884
This could be a tricky war and a
long dry spell in the hotel trade.

524
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,599
For all we know, they could
board us up tomorrow.

525
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,902
Let's make
a solemn blood-pact.

526
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,423
We'll contact the black market
and liquidate <i>Boy with Apple</i>

527
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,607
by the end of the week,

528
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,067
then leave the country
and lay low

529
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,610
somewhere along
the Maltese Riviera

530
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,363
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

531
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,289
In exchange for
your help, your loyalty

532
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,283
and your services
as my personal valet,

533
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,039
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale price.

534
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,248
1.5?
Plus room and board.

535
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,128
Could we make it 10?
10? Are you joking?

536
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,095
That's more than
I'd pay an actual dealer,

537
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,598
and you wouldn't know chiaroscuro
from chicken giblets.

538
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,478
No, 1.5 is correct.
But I'll tell you what,

539
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,891
if I die first, and I most certainly
will, you will be my sole heir.

540
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,495
There's not much
in the kitty except

541
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,898
a set of ivory-backed
hairbrushes

542
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,441
and my library of
romantic poetry,

543
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,270
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

544
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,778
along with whatever we haven't
already spent on whores and whiskey.

545
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,568
This is our sacred bond.

546
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,778
I'll draw it up right now.

547
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,833
I, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave H, being of
relatively sound mind and body,

548
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,922
on this day,
the 19th of October,

549
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,916
in the year of our Lord 1932...

550
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,968
<i>He never told
me where he came from.</i>

551
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,675
<i>I never asked who
his family had been.</i>

552
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,614
Excuse me.

553
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,283
Uh-huh?

554
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,829
The police are here.
They asked for you.

555
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,710
Tell them I'll be right down.

556
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,504
Okay.

557
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,724
Have you ever been questioned
by the authorities?

558
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,331
Yes, on one occasion
I was arrested

559
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,643
and tortured by
the rebel militia

560
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,895
after the Desert Uprising.

561
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,064
You know the drill, then. Zip it.
Of course.

562
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,689
You've never heard the word "van
Hoytl" in your life. Okay, let's go.

563
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,705
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

564
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,166
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

565
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,923
"By order of the Commissioner
of Police, Zubrowka Province,

566
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,970
I hereby place you under
arrest for the murder

567
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,556
of Madame Céline Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis."

568
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,217
I knew there was
something fishy.

569
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,844
We never got the cause of death.

570
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,226
She's been murdered
and you think I did it.

571
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,892
Hey!

572
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,729
Stop!

573
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,951
What happened?

574
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,624
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

575
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,457
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski

576
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,459
who had the gall to
question my virility,

577
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,919
because if there's one thing we've
learned from penny dreadfuls,

578
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,285
it's that, when you find
yourself in a place like this,

579
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,802
you must never
be a candy-ass.

580
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,970
You've got to prove
yourself from Day One.

581
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,632
You've got to win their respect.

582
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,094
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

583
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,273
He's, actually,
become a dear friend.

584
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,975
You'll meet him, I hope.

585
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,024
So. You've talked to Kovacs?

586
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,647
I saw him last night in secret.

587
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,136
He made me take an oath on a
Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.

588
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,366
You're supposed to also.

589
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,655
I'll do that later.

590
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,990
He suspects you're innocent.

591
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,325
Of course he does.

592
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,285
What's the charge?

593
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,669
In the small hours of
the evening of 19 October,

594
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,918
an individual well-known to the house
and staff, a <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave H,

595
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:32,251
did arrive at the Desgoffe
und Taxis residence in Lutz

596
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,962
and entered by
the rear service alley,

597
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,513
alerting no one to his presence,

598
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:40,468
and did then proceed by way of
back stairs and servants' passage,

599
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,019
to deliver himself into the
private chambers of Madame D.

600
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,768
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

601
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,441
had been pre-arranged
with her or not.

602
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:53,522
The next morning Madame D was found
dead by strychnine poisoning.

603
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,891
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave was not
observed on the premises again

604
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,239
until, of course,
24 hours later.

605
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,697
The identity of
his accusers is made

606
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,116
clear in this
notarized deposition.

607
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,749
They include, essentially, all
members of the extended family,

608
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:12,674
but the key witness who actually
ostensibly saw the alleged events

609
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:15,502
appears to have
fled the jurisdiction.

610
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,383
His whereabouts are
currently unknown,

611
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,215
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

612
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,517
Who is he?

613
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,639
Serge?

614
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,765
I'm afraid so.

615
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,226
That little prick.

616
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,562
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

617
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,898
I've been dropped
into a nest of vipers.

618
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,106
You have an alibi?

619
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,488
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westphalia.

620
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,333
I can't allow her name to get
mixed-up in all this monkey business.

621
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,372
Your life may be at stake.

622
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,332
I know, but the bitch legged it.

623
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:50,288
She's already on board the <i>Queen
Nasstasja</i> halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

624
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,041
Don't give up.

625
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,639
<i>The details of the conspiracy,</i>

626
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,885
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

627
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,222
<i>were, at that time, impossible
for us to apprehend.</i>

628
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,119
I'm looking for Serge X,

629
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,167
a young man in
the service of my employer,

630
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,872
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

631
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,091
Yes, sir?
You're his sister?

632
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,674
Yes, sir.
Seen him lately?

633
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,965
No, sir.
No, sir?

634
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,049
No, sir.

635
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,268
I need to find him right away,
for his own safety

636
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,019
and everybody else's.

637
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,898
If he shows up...

638
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,855
Yes, sir?
Tell him Jopling says,

639
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,316
"Come home."

640
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,078
<i>But one thing was certain,</i>

641
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,709
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis
were a very powerful family,</i>

642
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,049
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

643
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,848
A letter from
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave. Zero.

644
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,763
You want me to?
Read it.

645
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,570
"My dear and
trusted colleagues..."

646
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,819
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

647
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,027
of my regrettable and
preposterous incarceration.

648
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,328
Until I walk amongst
you again as a free man,

649
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,906
the Grand Budapest
remains in your hands,

650
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,287
as does its
impeccable reputation.

651
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,494
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

652
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,046
Take extra special care of
every little-bitty bit of it

653
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,340
as if I were watching
over you like a hawk

654
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,010
with a horse whip in its
talons, because I am.

655
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:06,260
Should I discover a lapse of
any variety during my absence,

656
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,094
I promise, swift and merciless
justice will descend upon you.

657
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,272
A great and noble house has been
placed under your protection.

658
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,100
Tell Zero if you see
any funny business.

659
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,436
"Your devoted
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave."

660
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,964
Then there's a poem, but we
might want to start on the soup

661
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,482
since it's 46 stanzas.

662
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:28,446
"A moist, black ash dampens the
filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

663
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,747
and mingles with
the thick scent of wood rot

664
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,745
while the lark song
of a guttersnipe..."

665
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,202
I never trusted that butler.

666
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,208
He's too honest.

667
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,080
<i>- Too honest, you say?</i>
Mmm-hmm.

668
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,416
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,</i>

669
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,584
<i>find him quick
and make it snappy.</i>

670
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,486
May I offer any of you
inmates a plate of mush?

671
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,403
No? Anyone?

672
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,860
You with the very
large scar on your face?

673
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:21,123
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

674
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,377
It needs a dash of salt.

675
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,804
Good day.

676
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,640
Mush, gents?
Any takers?

677
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,317
Suit yourselves.

678
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,533
Rise and shine.
Chop, chop.

679
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,330
Good morning, Pinky.

680
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,417
Mendl's again?

681
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,714
Precisely.

682
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,917
Who's got the throat slitter?

683
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:12,928
Out of this world.

684
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,426
Mendi's is the best.

685
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,762
Well, back to work.
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave?

686
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,770
Yes?

687
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,859
Me and the boys talked it over.

688
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,533
We think you're
a really straight fellow.

689
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,906
Well, I've never been
accused of that before,

690
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,079
but I appreciate the sentiment.

691
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,656
You're one of us now.

692
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,917
What a lovely thing to say.

693
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,995
Thank you, dear Pinky.
Thank you, Günther.

694
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,625
Thank you, Wolf.

695
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,832
Anything else?

696
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,714
Tell him, Ludwig.

697
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,970
Checkpoint 19 ain't
no two-bit hoosegow.

698
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,427
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

699
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,230
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

700
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,731
You got a 325-foot drop into
a moat full of crocodiles.

701
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,903
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

702
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,856
which in this case
happens to take the form

703
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,192
of a storm-drain sewer system

704
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,698
dating from the time of the
original rock fortification

705
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,950
way back in the Middle Ages.

706
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,250
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

707
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,201
with a fine lady
and a white poodle,

708
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,040
but it's got what
you'd call "vulnerability,"

709
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,921
and that's our bread and butter.

710
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,923
Take a look.

711
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,472
Who drew this?

712
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,766
What do you mean,
"Who drew this?" I did.

713
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:39,060
Very good. You've got
a wonderful line, Ludwig.

714
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,933
This shows great
artistic promise.

715
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,516
Question, how do you intend to
penetrate this lowest rudiment?

716
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,273
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

717
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,194
Digging with
the throat-slitter,

718
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,023
I expect this would take three to
six months of continual effort,

719
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,792
during which time
several of our members

720
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,363
will have been
violently executed.

721
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,912
You hit the nail on the head,
Mr. Gustave.

722
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,706
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

723
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,285
a rope ladder made of
sticks and bunk-linens,

724
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,369
but we need digging tools,

725
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,548
which are proving hard to
come by in this flop-house.

726
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:24,569
<i>At this point in the story,</i>

727
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,275
<i>the old man fell silent and
pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

728
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:31,320
<i>His eyes went
blank as two stones.</i>

729
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,522
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

730
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,948
Are you ill,
Mr. Moustafa?

731
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,283
<i>I finally asked.</i>

732
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,576
Oh, dear me, no.

733
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,785
<i>He said.</i>

734
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,409
It's only that I don't
know how to proceed.

735
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,788
<i>He was crying.</i>

736
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,494
You see,
I never speak of Agatha,

737
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:50,297
because even at
the thought of her name

738
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:53,251
I'm unable to
control my emotions.

739
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,590
Well, I suppose
there's no way around it.

740
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,226
You see, she saved us.

741
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,353
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

742
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,477
<i>I had asked for her hand in
marriage and she had agreed.</i>

743
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,558
Will you marry me?
Yes.

744
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:14,231
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

745
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,692
<i>No one knew, of course, but,
then, who would have cared?</i>

746
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,653
<i>We were each completely
on our own in the world,</i>

747
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,781
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

748
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,424
Here.
Thank you.

749
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,468
It's a book.
I see.

750
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,171
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

751
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,619
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave recommended it.

752
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,910
I have a copy of my own as well.

753
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,891
I ruined the surprise,
I suppose.

754
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,977
I'll go ahead
and open it, anyway.

755
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,433
Read the inscription.

756
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,043
<i>Monsieur Gustave insisted</i>

757
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,497
<i>on an immediate and thorough
cross-examination...</i>

758
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,378
She's charming.
She's so charming.

759
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,006
<i>...during which he presented
Agatha with a porcelain pendant</i>

760
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,134
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

761
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,467
<i>in a box the size
of a child's coffin.</i>

762
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,971
It's not right.

763
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,389
I beg your pardon?

764
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:27,766
Why is he sulking?

765
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,970
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

766
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:33,401
I'm only interviewing this vision
of loveliness on your behalf.

767
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,195
Never be jealous in this life,
Zero, not even for an instant.

768
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,942
Is he flirting with you?

769
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,733
Yes.

770
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,360
I approve of this union.

771
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,071
Agatha, my beauty,
return to your beloved.

772
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,576
<i>Soon we learned...</i>

773
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,499
Blessings upon you both.

774
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,417
<i>...not only was Agatha
immensely skilled</i>

775
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:53,121
<i>with a palette knife and
a butter-cream flourish...</i>

776
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,331
Mendl.
Go.

777
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,501
<i>...she was also very brave.</i>

778
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,057
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

779
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,491
Something's missing.

780
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:31,166
A crucial document, either misplaced
or, conceivably, destroyed.

781
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,870
I don't know what it contains, I
don't know what it represents,

782
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,455
I don't know what it is,

783
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,758
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere.

784
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,676
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

785
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,756
and I don't expect to see
any significant change

786
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,235
in the magistrate's
ultimate decision

787
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:45,806
vis-à-vis your
own inheritance,

788
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,806
but, especially given the
circumstances of the death,

789
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,183
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness

790
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,474
in the murder case, Serge X,

791
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,523
I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

792
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,778
to the attention of
the municipal inspector

793
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,730
so that there can be
absolutely no question

794
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,316
of impropriety
at any future date.

795
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,276
Agreed?
Not agreed.

796
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,205
Not agreed?
Not agreed.

797
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,500
Can I ask you a question,
Vilmos?

798
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,164
Yes, Dmitri?

799
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,666
Who are you working for?

800
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,039
I beg your pardon?

801
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,045
Who are you working for?

802
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,005
I thought you're supposed
to be our lawyer.

803
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,677
Well, in point of fact,

804
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,595
I'm the executor of the estate.

805
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,926
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

806
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,135
Oh, yeah?

807
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,013
Yeah. A provision for my fees
was included in the...

808
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:39,022
Just wrap it up and
don't make waves. Agreed?

809
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,988
I'm an attorney.
I'm obligated to

810
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,073
proceed according
to the rule of law.

811
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,568
Not agreed.

812
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,206
This stinks, sisters.

813
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,711
Did he just throw
my cat out the window?

814
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,798
I don't think so.

815
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:05,878
No. Did he?
Jopling?

816
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,767
Shh-Shh.

817
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,865
Okay.

818
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,170
There's something
I haven't told you, Agatha.

819
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,596
Okay.
We stole a painting.

820
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,346
It's very valuable, maybe five
million Klubecks, in fact.

821
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,427
I don't know if anyone's
even noticed it's missing yet,

822
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:56,228
but if something
should happen to me...

823
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,930
You steal art?

824
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,063
One picture. Anyway, we need to
make a plan for your survival.

825
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:05,148
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

826
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,711
but it tells you exactly where
and how to find <i>Boy with</i> Apple.

827
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,779
Don't take less than half the
retail asking price. Also...

828
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,281
Zero, I'm a baker.

829
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,699
You're a pastry chef.

830
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,780
I'm not a fence,
if that's the term.

831
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:16,866
I don't trade in
stolen property.

832
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,960
I said it wrong.
She willed it to him.

833
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,338
Go to sleep.

834
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,849
Yes, <i>Herr</i> Mendl.

835
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,346
Hide this.
No.

836
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,556
Okay, but take it anyway.

837
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,773
<i>The next morning,
Herr Becker received a peculiar,</i>

838
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,692
<i>last-minute notice from the
office of Deputy Kovacs,</i>

839
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:17,364
<i>postponing their scheduled
meeting, in perpetuity.</i>

840
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,471
Let's blow.

841
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,501
How did you get out there?

842
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:01,878
Shut the fuck up.

843
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,713
These guys are trying to escape.

844
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,640
What's wrong with you,
you goddamn snitch?

845
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:08,842
Guard! Guard!

846
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,393
It's you.
Thank you.

847
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:19,604
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

848
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,468
Okay.

849
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,863
Whoa!

850
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,128
I suppose you'd
call that a draw.

851
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,264
Good evening.

852
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:31,152
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf,
Ludwig, this is the divine Zero.

853
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,202
Gunther was slain
in the catacombs.

854
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:36,198
Well, boys, who knows when we'll
all meet again, but if one day...

855
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,495
Hold it.

856
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,872
No time to gab.

857
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,499
Take care of yourself,
Mr. Gustave.

858
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,667
Good luck, kid.

859
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,798
Which way to the safe house?

860
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,391
I couldn't find one.

861
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:57,557
No safe house? Really? We're
completely on our own out here?

862
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,893
I'm afraid so. I asked around, but...

863
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:04,059
I understand. Too risky.
We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.

864
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:06,520
Let's put on our disguises.

865
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:07,733
We're wearing them.

866
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:08,855
No, we're not.

867
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,533
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

868
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:12,863
You didn't bring any?

869
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,266
I thought you were growing one.

870
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,326
And it wouldn't look
realistic, would it?

871
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,704
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

872
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,876
But I take your point.
So be it.

873
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,504
Give me a few squirts of <i>L'air
de Panache,</i> please, will you?

874
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,833
Can I not get a squirt, even?

875
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,551
I forgot the <i>L'air de Panache.</i>

876
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:32,345
Honestly, you forgot
the <i>L'air de Panache?</i>

877
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:35,516
I don't believe it.
How could you?

878
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:38,685
I've been in jail, Zero! Do you
understand how humiliating this is?

879
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,887
I smell.

880
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,767
That's just marvelous, isn't it?

881
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,235
I suppose this is to
be expected back in...

882
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,732
Where do you come from again?

883
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,439
Aq Salim al-Jabat.
Precisely.

884
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,238
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat

885
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,697
where one's prized possessions

886
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,861
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

887
01:00:56,945 --> 01:01:00,745
and one sleeps behind a tent flap and
survives on wild dates and scarabs.

888
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,452
But it's not how I trained you.

889
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,342
What on God's earth
possessed you to <i>leave</i>

890
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:06,755
the homeland where
you obviously belong

891
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,290
and travel unspeakable distances

892
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:11,965
to become a penniless immigrant in a
refined, highly-cultivated society

893
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,214
that, quite frankly, could've
gotten along very well without you?

894
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:17,132
The war.

895
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,601
Say again?

896
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:21,807
Well, you see,
my father was murdered

897
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,647
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad.

898
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,312
Our village was
burned to the ground

899
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:29,778
and those who managed to
survive were forced to flee.

900
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,779
I left because of the war.

901
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:36,452
I see. So you're, actually, really
more of a refugee, in that sense?

902
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,612
Truly.

903
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,499
Well, I suppose I'd better take
back everything I just said.

904
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:46,837
What a bloody idiot I am.
Pathetic fool.

905
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,172
Goddamn, selfish bastard.

906
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,463
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

907
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,175
I apologize on
behalf of the hotel.

908
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,861
It's not your fault. You were
just upset I forgot the perfume.

909
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:02,970
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

910
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:07,024
You are my dear friend and protégé
and I'm very proud of you.

911
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,518
You must know that.

912
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,770
I'm so sorry, Zero.

913
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:15,315
We're brothers.

914
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,492
How's our darling Agatha?

915
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,207
"'Twas first light when I saw
her face upon the heath,

916
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,050
and hence did I return,
day-by-day, entranced,

917
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,171
tho' vinegar did brine my
heart, never..."

918
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,058
Very good. I'm going to stop you
there because the alarm has sounded,

919
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,685
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

920
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,448
I want roadblocks
at every junction for 50km.

921
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:07,375
I want rail blocks at every
train station for 100km.

922
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,210
I want 50 men and 10 bloodhounds

923
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,458
ready in five minutes.

924
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,209
We're going
to strip-search

925
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,970
every pretzel<i>-Haus,
Waffel</i>-hut, <i>Biergarten</i>

926
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,134
and especially every grand hotel

927
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,836
from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.

928
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,051
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

929
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,345
At least three of
them are anyway.

930
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:23,550
Who are you?

931
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:26,970
What are you doing here?

932
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,726
Civilian personnel aren't
permitted in the cellblock.

933
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,307
This is a military
investigation.

934
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,934
This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

935
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,236
His employer's mother
was one of the victims...

936
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,738
Shut up.

937
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:40,075
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

938
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:44,204
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on 23rd October?

939
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,748
I'm aware of his disappearance.

940
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,550
His body was found stuffed in a
sarcophagus behind a storage room

941
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,248
at the Kunstmuseum
late last night.

942
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,088
<i>He was short four fingers.</i>

943
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,544
What do you know about that?

944
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,917
Nothing.

945
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,587
Escort Mr. Jopling
off the premises.

946
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,099
Mendi's.

947
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,115
Operator, get me the Excelsior
Palace in Baden-Jürgen

948
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,775
and reverse the charges, please.

949
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,868
We've no choice. There's
nowhere else to turn.

950
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,366
I'll hold.
Thank you.

951
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,289
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

952
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:31,328
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

953
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,211
Do you swear? Of course.
What is it, in fact?

954
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,537
I can't say.

955
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,959
How does one come by
front-row aisle seats

956
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:42,463
for a first night at the Opera
Toscana with one day's notice?

957
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:44,131
How does one arrange
a private viewing

958
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,134
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

959
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,476
How does one secure a corner table
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

960
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:53,936
Ivan, darling,
it's Gustave. Hello.

961
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,142
Well, I was until
about five minutes ago.

962
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,488
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear
out in a hurry if you see what I mean.

963
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:02,149
Well, through a sewer,
as it happens. Exactly.

964
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:05,036
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to cut you
off, but we're in a bit of a bind.

965
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:06,824
This is an official request.

966
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:10,160
I'm formally calling upon
the special services of...

967
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,834
<i>I'll call you back, Gustave.</i>

968
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,003
Right. Stand by.

969
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,423
I beg your pardon.
Do you prefer to walk?

970
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,504
We're right here.
It's very simple.

971
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,756
Straight down the corniche,
then left.

972
01:05:26,965 --> 01:05:28,967
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

973
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,143
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Georges
at the Château Luxe, please.

974
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,310
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

975
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,603
Take over.

976
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:42,109
<i>Happy birthday, dear...</i>

977
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:43,524
<i>Hello, Ivan?</i>

978
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,535
Got it.

979
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,530
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Dino at the
Palazzo Principessa, please.

980
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,626
Higher, goddammit, higher!

981
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:58,209
Take over.

982
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,964
<i>Monsieur Georges.</i>
Higher.

983
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,338
I see. Straightaway.

984
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,380
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Robin at
l'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please.

985
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,008
...and two and three.

986
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,145
<i>Monsieur</i> Robin. There's a call
from <i>Monsieur</i> Dino for you.

987
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,347
Take over.

988
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,067
One, two, three.

989
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,481
<i>Yes, Dino.</i>

990
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,985
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

991
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,326
Get me <i>Monsieur</i> Martin
at the Ritz Imperial, please.

992
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,905
Too much salt.

993
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,618
Not enough pepper.

994
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,202
Take over.

995
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,339
<i>Robin? Martin.</i>
Too much salt.

996
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,541
So I've heard.

997
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:47,846
Maybe.
Let me make a few calls.

998
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,429
Serge X, missing.
Deputy Kovacs, also missing.

999
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:58,439
Madame D, dead. <i>Boy with
Apple,</i> stolen, by us.

1000
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:01,067
Dmitri and Jopling, ruthless,
cold-blooded savages.

1001
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:04,521
Gustave H, at large.
What else?

1002
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,026
Zero, confused.

1003
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,444
Zero, confused, indeed.

1004
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:09,780
The plot "thickens,"
as they say.

1005
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,620
Why, by the way?
Is it a soup metaphor?

1006
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,864
I don't know.

1007
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,295
Get in.

1008
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,045
We found the butler.

1009
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,049
He's hiding out in the remote
foothills near Gabelmeister's Peak.

1010
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:30,381
Our Contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

1011
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,965
at the observatory
on the summit.

1012
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,475
Tell no one.
He'll explain everything.

1013
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,765
Your train departs
in four and a half minutes.

1014
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,392
Here's your tickets.

1015
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:39,643
Third class?

1016
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:40,807
It was overbooked

1017
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,652
but the conductor used to be a
sommelier at the old Versailles.

1018
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:45,983
He pulled some strings.

1019
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,273
You'll need these
for the dining car.

1020
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,152
One last thing.

1021
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,823
<i>L'air de Panache</i>

1022
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,498
They only had
the half-ounce.

1023
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,792
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

1024
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,254
How much money you got? 42
Klubecks and 3 postage stamps.

1025
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,463
Give me 25. Yes.

1026
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:17,552
Bless you.

1027
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,099
Please.

1028
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,578
I've got to hand it to him.

1029
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:37,814
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1030
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:41,577
I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

1031
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:47,049
<i>Talk to the club-footed sister
again, and, this time, be persuasive.</i>

1032
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,971
Goddamn son of a bitch.

1033
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,533
Holy fuck!

1034
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,750
What's the meaning of this shit?

1035
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,556
<i>Boy with Apple?</i>
I thought you'd hidden it.

1036
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,095
Why are you only noticing now? I
assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

1037
01:09:34,337 --> 01:09:36,010
Are you fucking kidding me?

1038
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,091
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1039
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,390
I believe it was removed
by <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

1040
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,394
I'm not angry with Serge.

1041
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,072
You can't blame someone for their
basic lack of moral fiber.

1042
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,240
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

1043
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,481
It's not his fault, is it? I don't know.
It depends.

1044
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,241
Well, you can say that
about most anything.

1045
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,742
"It depends."
Of course it depends.

1046
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,627
Of course it depends.
Of course it depends.

1047
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,793
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

1048
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,459
That doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

1049
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:15,258
May I officiate, by the way?
The ceremony?

1050
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:16,462
With pleasure.

1051
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,257
I must say, I find that
girl utterly delightful.

1052
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:20,967
Flat as a board,
enormous birthmark

1053
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,969
the shape of Mexico
over half her face,

1054
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,313
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

1055
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,893
while Mendl,
genius though he is,

1056
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,645
looms over her like
a hulking gorilla.

1057
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,064
Yet without question,
without fail,

1058
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:34,489
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

1059
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:35,990
Why?

1060
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,826
Because of her purity.

1061
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,156
She admires you as well,
<i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.

1062
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:44,665
Does she?

1063
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,079
Very much.

1064
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:50,084
That's a good sign, you know.
It means she "gets it."

1065
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,290
That's important.

1066
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,753
Don't flirt with her.

1067
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,057
A radio telegram was delivered
and signed for by the girl at 4:00 AM.

1068
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,900
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

1069
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:50,982
However, the telegraph
office always keeps

1070
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,809
a carbon of the ticker tape
for 24 hours.

1071
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,236
I copied it down.
It reads as follows,

1072
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,401
"Pack your things stop."

1073
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,741
"Be ready to leave
at moment's notice stop."

1074
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:02,368
"Hide-out is vicinity
of Gabelmeister's Peak stop."

1075
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,991
"Destroy this message
all my love full stop."

1076
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,870
Where's the basket?

1077
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,184
Where you headed, mister?

1078
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,240
Skiing? Sledding?
Mountain climbing?

1079
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,918
Three Klubecks.

1080
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,965
<i>By express
wireless, I wrote Agatha</i>

1081
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,800
<i>with instructions to move
to our pre-arranged hideout,</i>

1082
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,470
<i>a Gypsy caravan
on the outer Nebelsbad road,</i>

1083
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,472
<i>while Monsieur Gustave
and I continued east</i>

1084
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,099
<i>into the Zubrowkian Alps,</i>

1085
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:18,062
<i>toward our high-altitude rendezvous
with the butler Serge X.</i>

1086
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,277
<i>As a precaution,
we disembarked quietly</i>

1087
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,904
<i>in the freight yard
just outside the station.</i>

1088
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:34,334
<i>L'air de Panache.</i>

1089
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,442
It's a hell of a view. I give
them that, for what's it's worth.

1090
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,467
I agree.

1091
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:03,989
"'Tis oft'-remarked, no single,
falling-flake does any other

1092
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:07,826
in its pure and perfect form..."
Somebody's coming.

1093
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,537
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1094
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,996
Uh-huh.

1095
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,369
Get on the next cable car.

1096
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:59,333
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1097
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,538
Uh-huh.

1098
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:01,664
Switch with me.

1099
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:33,954
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave of the
Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

1100
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,539
Uh-huh.

1101
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:36,953
Put these on and sing.

1102
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,943
Psst.

1103
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:06,274
Are you <i>Monsieur</i>
Gustave of the...

1104
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,567
Yes, dammit.

1105
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,773
Confess.

1106
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,779
I'm innocent.

1107
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,826
Hmm? No, no.

1108
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:25,002
Forgive me, <i>Monsieur</i> Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

1109
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,586
They threatened my life and now

1110
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,129
they've murdered my only family.

1111
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,927
No. Who did they
kill this time?

1112
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,253
My dear sister.

1113
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:32,504
The girl with the club foot?

1114
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,093
Yes.
Those fuckers!

1115
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:35,738
I tried to warn you
at the beginning.

1116
01:16:35,925 --> 01:16:37,347
I know, darling.
Let's put that behind us.

1117
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,012
Listen, I hate to
put you on the spot,

1118
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,604
but I really must ask
you to clear my name.

1119
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:43,854
Obviously you're grieving...
There's more.

1120
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,443
To the story.
I get it. Go on.

1121
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,645
I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

1122
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,446
to the creation of a second will

1123
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:52,696
to be executed only in the
event of her death by murder.

1124
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,360
A second will?
Right.

1125
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,157
In case she got bumped off?
Right.

1126
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:57,784
Uh-huh?
But they destroyed it.

1127
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,456
Oh, dear.
However...

1128
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,159
Uh-huh?
I pulled a copy.

1129
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,495
A second copy of
the second will?

1130
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:04,999
Right.
Uh-huh?

1131
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:10,050
What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, dammit?

1132
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,249
Don't keep us in suspense.

1133
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,011
This has been a complete
fucking nightmare.

1134
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,635
Just tell us what
the fuck is going on!

1135
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:18,888
Serge?

1136
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:20,682
Serge? Serge!

1137
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:27,067
Bloody hell. They've
strangled the poor slob.

1138
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:56,046
Come on! Let's go!

1139
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:05,173
What do we do if we catch him?

1140
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:06,228
I don't know.

1141
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,730
He's a homicidal psychopath.
Let's stop.

1142
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,187
I can't. I can barely steer.

1143
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:22,634
You sick, pathetic creep.
I hate you.

1144
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,777
"'If this do be me end, farewell"

1145
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,199
cried the wounded piper-boy,

1146
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:41,902
whilst the muskets cracked

1147
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,363
and the yeomen
roared 'Hurrah!'"

1148
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:44,701
"And the ramparts fell."

1149
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:49,960
"'Methinks me breathes me
last, me fears!' said he..."

1150
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,037
Holy shit! You got him!

1151
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,211
Well done, Zero!

1152
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,728
<i>Gustave H! You are
a fugitive from justice!</i>

1153
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,564
<i>Surrender lawfully and
I will personally vouchsafe</i>

1154
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:11,849
<i>your fair treatment.</i>

1155
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,521
<i>Do not attempt to flee!</i>

1156
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,228
What do you think?
I don't know.

1157
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,816
I'd rather jump off
this cliff right now

1158
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,314
than go back to fucking prison.

1159
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,962
I say we steal that sick maniac's
motorcycle, go fetch Agatha,

1160
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,197
take back <i>Boy with Apple</i>

1161
01:20:22,276 --> 01:20:23,903
and head for the Maltese
Riviera, once and for all.

1162
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,906
Very good! You're so extraordinary, Zero.
Thank you.

1163
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,575
A moment of silence in
memoriam of a devoted servant

1164
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,544
killed violently during
the conduct of his duties.

1165
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,499
Goodbye, Serge.

1166
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,003
Okay, let's go.

1167
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,605
<i>The war began at midnight.</i>

1168
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:58,271
<i>Pffeifelstad fell by lunch
under heavy shelling,</i>

1169
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:01,824
<i>and 10 battalions surged across
the long western border.</i>

1170
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:03,822
<i>High-command
advanced to Nebelsbad.</i>

1171
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,668
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl,
for the executive staff.

1172
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:26,155
General Stieglitz requests a garden-view
sitting room with an extra roll-away.

1173
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:28,141
Let's put him in
the Duke Leopold Suite.

1174
01:21:28,342 --> 01:21:30,015
Secretary Woroniecki's
office cabled.

1175
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:33,814
He's checking in a day early.
Rooms 401 -2-3.

1176
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,645
Tell Tactical Logistics
we're moving them

1177
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,369
to a standard double
on the third floor.

1178
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,402
They'll need more
space than that.

1179
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:07,177
The beginning of the end of
the end of the beginning has begun.

1180
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:10,388
A sad finale played off-key
on a broken-down saloon piano

1181
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,186
in the outskirts of
a forgotten ghost town.

1182
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:15,347
I'd rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy.

1183
01:22:15,556 --> 01:22:16,557
Me neither.

1184
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:19,063
The Grand Budapest
has become a troops' barracks.

1185
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,737
I shall never cross its
threshold again in my lifetime.

1186
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,439
Me neither.
Never again shall I...

1187
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,693
Actually, I think we might be going
in there right now after all.

1188
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,946
Dmitri.

1189
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,624
Agatha.

1190
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,535
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
I'm <i>Monsieur</i> Chuck.

1191
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:50,883
We've booked you and your sisters
into the King Ferdinand Suite.

1192
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,059
Good evening. General Von
Shrecker asked me...

1193
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,557
Who's that?

1194
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,063
I beg your pardon?

1195
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,974
I think that girl's
got my picture. Excuse me.

1196
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,576
- Six.
- Hold it.

1197
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:21,793
Six.

1198
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,756
Compliments of <i>Herr</i> Mendl.

1199
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:43,936
Excuse me.

1200
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,303
Have you seen a pastry girl
with a package under her arm

1201
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:47,638
in the last minute and a half?

1202
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:50,213
Yep. She just got on the elevator with Mr.
Desgoffe und Taxis.

1203
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,494
Thank you.

1204
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,116
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

1205
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,906
Otto, sir, the new Lobby Boy.

1206
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,624
You haven't been
trained properly.

1207
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,952
A Lobby Boy never provides
information of that kind.

1208
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,120
You're a stone wall.
Understood?

1209
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:20,564
Pretty picture.

1210
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,391
Sixth floor.

1211
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:07,902
Where's <i>Boy with Apple?</i>

1212
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:11,107
None of your goddamn business!

1213
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:15,573
I'm going to blast your candy-ass
once and for all right now.

1214
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:26,584
Drop your weapon!

1215
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,733
Cease fire! Cease fire! Whoa!

1216
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:52,280
Stop it!

1217
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,074
Who's shooting who?

1218
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,735
That's Gustave H! The escaped
murderer and art thief.

1219
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,115
I've got him cornered!

1220
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,742
That's Dmitri
Desgoffe und Taxis!

1221
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:01,948
He's responsible for the
killing of Deputy Kovacs,

1222
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:05,001
Serge X and his club-footed
sister, plus his own mother!

1223
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,751
Nobody move.
Everybody's under arrest.

1224
01:26:10,123 --> 01:26:12,421
Who's out the window?

1225
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,586
Agatha!

1226
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:21,806
310-bis.

1227
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,227
Hang on! Here I come!

1228
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,713
Something's
on the back of the...

1229
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:57,129
Agatha!

1230
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,013
Agatha!

1231
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,216
Are you all right?
I think so.

1232
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,852
Something's on
the back of the picture.

1233
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:19,234
<i>She left everything</i>

1234
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,035
<i>to Monsieur Gustave, of course.</i>

1235
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:25,332
<i>The mansion,
known as Schloss Lutz,</i>

1236
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,920
<i>the factories, which produced
weapons, medicine and textiles,</i>

1237
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,546
<i>an important
newspaper syndicate,</i>

1238
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:38,045
<i>and perhaps
you've already deduced</i>

1239
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:44,056
<i>this very institution,
the Grand Budapest Hotel.</i>

1240
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:45,886
<i>He anointed me his successor,</i>

1241
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:49,018
<i>and as the war continued,
I served my adopted country</i>

1242
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:52,401
<i>from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room.</i>

1243
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:55,946
<i>He was the same
as his disciples,</i>

1244
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:59,533
<i>insecure, vain,
superficial, blond, needy.</i>

1245
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:02,577
<i>In the end he was even rich.</i>

1246
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:07,119
<i>He did not succeed, however,
in growing old.</i>

1247
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:13,747
"Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together..."

1248
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,798
<i>Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

1249
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,294
<i>She and our infant son would
be killed two years later</i>

1250
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:21,387
<i>by the Prussian grippe.
An absurd little disease.</i>

1251
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,137
<i>Today we treat it
in a single week,</i>

1252
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:26,806
<i>but, in those days
many millions died.</i>

1253
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:31,939
<i>On the 21st day
of the occupation,</i>

1254
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,893
<i>the morning the independent
state of Zubrowka</i>

1255
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:36,232
<i>officially ceased to exist,</i>

1256
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:38,396
<i>we traveled with
Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.</i>

1257
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:40,816
In answer to your earlier
question, by the way,

1258
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,909
of course.

1259
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,580
Zero asked me about my humble
beginnings in the hotel trade.

1260
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,083
I was, perhaps, for a time,
considered the best Lobby Boy

1261
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:52,661
we'd ever had at
the Grand Budapest.

1262
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,333
I think I can say that.

1263
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,422
This one finally surpassed me.

1264
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:59,593
Although, I must say,
he had an exceptional teacher.

1265
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:00,923
Truly.

1266
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:09,144
"Whence came these two
radiant, celestial brothers,

1267
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,641
united, for an instant,

1268
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:15,101
as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window?"

1269
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:18,107
"One from the East
and one from the West."

1270
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,022
Very good.

1271
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:22,274
Don't flirt with her.

1272
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:26,862
Why are we stopping
at a barley field again?

1273
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:38,332
I find these black
uniforms very drab.

1274
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:44,133
Well, hello there, chaps.

1275
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,805
We were just talking about you.

1276
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,845
Documents, please.

1277
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,809
With pleasure, as always.

1278
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,020
You're the first of
the official death squads

1279
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,477
to whom we've been
formally introduced.

1280
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,645
How do you do?

1281
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,903
<i>Plus ça change,</i> am I right?

1282
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:11,740
Uh, that's a migratory visa with
stage three worker status, darling.

1283
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,991
Read this.

1284
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,677
Come outside.

1285
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,178
Now, stay there.

1286
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,678
I give you my word, if you
lay a finger on this man,

1287
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:32,056
I'll see you
dishonorably discharged,

1288
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,355
locked up in the stockade
and hanged by sundown.

1289
01:30:36,681 --> 01:30:38,524
<i>There are still
faint glimmers of civilization</i>

1290
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,856
<i>left in this
barbaric slaughterhouse</i>

1291
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:43,071
<i>that was once known as humanity.</i>

1292
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:49,744
You filthy, goddamn,
pock-marked, fascist assholes!

1293
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,536
<i>He was one of them.</i>

1294
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:55,663
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

1295
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:06,044
What happened in the end?

1296
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:08,254
In the end they shot him.

1297
01:31:10,048 --> 01:31:12,050
So it all went to me.

1298
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:24,146
<i>After dinner, we went
to collect the keys to our rooms,</i>

1299
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:26,239
<i>but Monsieur Jean
had abandoned his post.</i>

1300
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,571
I expect he's forgotten
all about us.

1301
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:29,901
<i>In recent years, of course,</i>

1302
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:32,321
<i>such properties and holdings
as the Grand Budapest</i>

1303
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:36,165
<i>had with very few exceptions
become common property.</i>

1304
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,165
<i>While the precise terms
of his negotiation</i>

1305
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:41,331
<i>with the new government
had never been announced,</i>

1306
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,696
<i>the result was an open secret,</i>

1307
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,300
<i>Zero Moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune</i>

1308
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,802
<i>in exchange for one costly,
unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

1309
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,841
<i>Why?</i>

1310
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:55,139
<i>Was it merely sentimental?</i>

1311
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:59,098
<i>It was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character,</i>

1312
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,107
<i>but I felt I must know,</i>

1313
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,351
<i>for my health, I suppose.</i>

1314
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,156
Forgive me for asking.
I hope I haven't upset you.

1315
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:10,358
No, of course not.

1316
01:32:11,443 --> 01:32:14,287
Is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world,

1317
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:16,790
his world, if you will?

1318
01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:18,708
His world?

1319
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:21,954
No, I don't think so.

1320
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,214
You see, we shared a vocation.

1321
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:26,174
It wouldn't have been necessary.

1322
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:31,050
No. The hotel
I keep for Agatha.

1323
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:33,802
We were happy here.

1324
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:36,009
For a little while.

1325
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:43,645
To be frank, I think
his world had vanished

1326
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,727
long before he ever entered it.

1327
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,524
But, I will say,

1328
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:51,233
he certainly sustained the
illusion with a marvelous grace.

1329
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:55,036
Are you going up?
No, I'll sit for a little while.

1330
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,034
Good night.

1331
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,531
<i>The next week,</i>

1332
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:05,922
<i>I sailed for a cure
in South America</i>

1333
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,758
<i>and began a long,
wandering journey abroad.</i>

1334
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,844
<i>I did not return to
Europe for many years.</i>

1335
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:19,352
<i>It was an enchanting old ruin.</i>

1336
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,855
<i>But I never
managed to see it again.</i>

1336
01:33:27,305 --> 01:34:27,646
