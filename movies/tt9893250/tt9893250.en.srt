2
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,822
Look at you, sitting there.

3
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,160
You think you're good people.

4
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,872
You're not good people.

5
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:25,085
Trust me, there's no
such thing as good people.

6
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,257
I used to be like you...

7
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,470
thinking that working hard
and playing fair

8
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,598
would lead to success
and happiness.

9
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,560
It doesn't.

10
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:45,022
Playing fair is a joke
invented by rich people

11
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,358
to keep the rest of us poor.

12
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,240
And I've been poor.

13
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,328
It doesn't agree with me.

14
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,292
'Cause there's two types
of people in this world:

15
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,169
the people who take...

16
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,588
and those getting took.

17
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,592
Predators and prey.

18
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:18,013
Lions and lambs.

19
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,686
My name is Marla Grayson,
and I'm not a lamb.

20
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,524
I am a fucking lioness.

21
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,560
She's my mother. I should
be able to see her whenever I want.

22
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,604
She doesn't need
to be in a care facility.

23
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,522
She doesn't need
a court-appointed guardian.

24
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,482
She has a loving son
to take care of her.

25
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,443
I don't understand how the court

26
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,320
can entrust my mother
to this stranger.

27
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,780
Miss Grayson forced my mother
into the home

28
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,783
when she made it very clear
that she didn't wanna go.

29
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,287
And now she has auctioned off
my mother's house, her car,

30
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,955
her personal belongings.

31
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,791
And she uses the proceeds
to pay herself.

32
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:31,337
And now Miss Grayson has barred
me from seeing my mother at all.

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,256
It's a goddamn nightmare.
She has kidnapped my mother!

34
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,717
Please, sir, calm down.

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,262
Marla Grayson is a
well-respected professional guardian

36
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,015
and has been appointed
by this court, by me,

37
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,518
to look after the best interests of your
mother now that she cannot look after herself.

38
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:50,105
How is it in my mother's best interest
to have her son barred from seeing her?

39
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,191
Miss Grayson doesn't care
about my mother at all.

40
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,193
Excuse me, Your Honor.
May I speak?

41
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,654
Go ahead, Miss Grayson.

42
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:03,077
Mr. Feldstrom, sir,
I sympathize.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,579
But the court doesn't
appoint me for no reason.

44
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:07,665
Your mother couldn't cope
on her own.

45
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,502
- That is not true.
- A doctor diagnosed her with dementia

46
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:16,006
and wrote an affidavit recommending
immediate action be taken for her safety.

47
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,885
You had ample opportunity to
move your mother into a care facility

48
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,012
or into your home.

49
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,097
You did neither.

50
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,392
She didn't want to
leave her home.

51
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,102
She begged me not to...

52
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,646
You can't care for her
by doing what she wants.

53
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,815
You have to do what she needs.

54
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,359
And that is why I can care
better than a family member,

55
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,486
because I have
no skin in the game.

56
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,072
I just do what is right
for your mother.

57
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,033
I manage your mother's money
because someone has to.

58
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:45,744
She'd let it run
into quite a mess.

59
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,997
And I have to pay for
her care in the facility,

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,082
so, yes, I oversaw the sale

61
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,292
of some of her assets
to finance that.

62
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,336
And, yes, I pay myself too.

63
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,674
Because caring, sir,
is my job, it's my profession.

64
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:03,512
This is what I do.
All day, every day, I care.

65
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,974
I care for those who are
in need of protection,

66
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,894
protection from apathy,
protection from their own pride

67
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,398
and, quite often, protection
from their own children.

68
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,192
- Hey! No!
- Your Honor, you and I have seen it many times,

69
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:21,447
offspring who are willing to let
their parents starve in squalor

70
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,908
and struggle with pain

71
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,787
rather than dip into what
they see as their inheritance

72
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,206
to pay for the necessary care.

73
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,296
Mr. Feldstrom, sir...

74
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,550
I sympathize, I do,

75
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,470
but your visits
to your mother upset her,

76
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,472
and the last time
you visited her,

77
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:51,018
you assaulted a staff member
and vandalized a reception area.

78
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,771
Is that not true?

79
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:58,734
Well...

80
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,070
Your Honor,
I think it's obvious

81
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,281
why the non-visitation order
must be upheld.

82
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:09,161
This court is doing its best to
protect and help Mrs. Feldstrom,

83
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,371
and the actions of her son

84
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,210
are undermining
our every effort in that fight.

85
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,966
I agree. Order upheld.

86
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,053
What? No.

87
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,649
- You won?
- I did.

88
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,359
I knew you would.

89
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,402
Hey! Bitch!

90
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,155
You! Bitch!

91
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,698
I think he's talking to you.

92
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,118
- Then he can use my name.
- Bitch. Hey.

93
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,371
I don't know how you live with
yourself. Our lives are being ruined.

94
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,289
I'm just doing my job.

95
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,250
Your fucking job?

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,835
- Fuck you!
- Hey.

97
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,045
I hope you get raped
and murdered,

98
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,880
and I hope you get killed.

99
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,591
You fucking... fucker.

100
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:08,262
Oh! Fuck, no, motherfucker!
I'll fucking get...

101
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,681
Does it sting more
because I'm a woman?

102
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:14,268
That you got so soundly beaten
in there by someone with a vagina?

103
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,396
Having a penis doesn't automatically
make you more scary to me,

104
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,939
just the opposite.

105
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,732
You may be a man,

106
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:26,488
but if you ever threaten,
touch or spit on me again...

107
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,159
I will grab your dick and balls

108
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,786
and I will rip them clean off,
you understand?

109
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,458
I'll tell your mom
you send your best.

110
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:54,892
Thanks.

111
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,894
Curtis.

112
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,353
Hey. Good going.

113
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,690
Hi, boss.
Congrats on the win.

114
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,234
Thanks, Addie.
So, what time is it now?

115
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,403
It's 2:17. That's...

116
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,364
Door to door, that's just
over five hours. Round it to six.

117
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,742
Charge it to the
Feldstrom account, full rate.

118
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,535
Okay. Oh. Sam Rice called.

119
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,829
- Asked that you return.
- I'll take it inside.

120
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,497
Fran, call the Realtor.

121
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,374
Check progress
on the Bather property.

122
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,293
The savings account
is nearly empty.

123
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,378
It won't cover the facility
bill after this month.

124
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,463
Got ya.

125
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:45,150
- Sam's on.
- Sam. How are you?

126
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,527
Hey. I'm good, Marla.
How about you?

127
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,404
Oh, working hard, playing hard.

128
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,073
- Fucking A.
- You called.

129
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,659
Yeah, uh, I got some news.

130
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,160
Good news or bad news?

131
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,871
Uh, sort of both.

132
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:02,209
Your ward, Alan Levitt, here
at our Berkshire Oaks facility,

133
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,460
he just died.

134
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,420
- What?
- Alan died.

135
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,547
This morning. Sorry.

136
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,549
No. Alan Levitt? Really?

137
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,385
- How?
- Stroke, big one.

138
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,429
- But he was young.
- Just 69 and a quarter.

139
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,431
Oh, God.

140
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,353
Alan.
Fuck. I only had him six months.

141
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,606
I thought he'd last us
at least another five years.

142
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,775
Fuck, now I have to
cash him out,

143
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,569
turn over everything to his
inheritors. What a fucking waste.

144
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,281
Maybe he took a shine to you
and wrote you into his will.

145
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,157
Yeah, right.

146
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,867
So, what's the good news?

147
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,953
Well, due to
Alan's tragic departure,

148
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,122
we now have a vacancy.

149
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,417
His room. Huh.
That's a corner deluxe.

150
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,795
- Yes, it is.
- Hold it for me.

151
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,757
Marla, you're not the only game
in town. There's a waiting list.

152
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,969
Fuck the waiting list.
How much?

153
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,929
Two grand a week
till it's filled.

154
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,848
Two grand?
It cost 500 last time.

155
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,975
If you don't pay,
someone else will.

156
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,103
Oh, fuck you, Sam.
All right, two grand.

157
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,522
- Thanks, Sam.
- Pleasure, Marla.

158
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,626
What?

159
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,254
You know.

160
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,090
Keep your eyes on the road.

161
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,068
Hi, Petra.
Dr. Karen's expecting me.

162
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,039
Alan Levitt? Fuck.

163
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,833
Sorry. I thought he had legs.

164
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,211
I know. So, now we're
in the market for a new client.

165
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,421
Got anyone for us?

166
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,715
There's a few I wouldn't mind
getting off my books.

167
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,676
You know, the real
high-maintenance assholes.

168
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,597
But there is actually someone I have
been meaning to talk to you about.

169
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,351
I've been feeling her out,
and I think she...

170
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,646
- I think she might be...
- No.

171
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,149
- I don't even wanna say it.
- A cherry?

172
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,069
Yes. Maybe. I think so.

173
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,363
Don't tease me.
Give me the details.

174
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:40,492
Come on, Marl. I can't just
give you a cherry for free.

175
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,911
I need something in return.

176
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,664
You hold stock in
Golden Light Care Homes, right?

177
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,582
Yeah, we have a chunk.

178
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,918
Sign some over to me.

179
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,921
Come on. I'm helping you
feed the money monster,

180
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,091
but I hardly see
any of the gold for myself.

181
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,884
Give me a taste.

182
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:03,849
Done.

183
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,351
But it has to be
a real cherry, bona fide.

184
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,408
- Jennifer Peterson.
- She's in reasonably good health.

185
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,412
But recently she has shown some
signs of memory loss and confusion.

186
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,289
- Significant?
- No.

187
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,000
We can tickle that to make
an emergency hearing go our way.

188
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,253
She has no kids, no husband,

189
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,796
no living family.

190
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,092
- No family at all?
- She has very good insurance.

191
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,013
She told me she used to work in finance
in Chicago and moved here to retire.

192
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,141
Can I get a copy of this?

193
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,519
You bet,
all except her test results.

194
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,229
That wouldn't be ethical.

195
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,274
Of course.

196
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:04,659
Jennifer Peterson.
Born April 15th, 1949.

197
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,830
She lives at 41 Williams Street
in Shallcross.

198
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:13,627
It's a real nice neighborhood,
expensive.

199
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,005
She bought the house seven
years ago, owns it outright.

200
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,219
Credit check came back A1,
totally clean.

201
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:28,391
No debt, no criminal record,
never been married.

202
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:37,150
She worked at the same company
for 40 years.

203
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:42,322
Looks like she downsized
when she retired, liquidated,

204
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:44,574
and now she's sitting
on a nest egg.

205
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:49,579
Like a golden fucking goose.
Look at this.

206
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,500
From her tax records, it says that
she has three separate saving accounts,

207
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,877
all earning monster interest.

208
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,046
She likes to go during
the day to the movies.

209
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,715
She reads a lot,
likes gardening.

210
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,134
Just your regular old lady.

211
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:06,429
- And she is sitting on a pile of cash.
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,059
She's rich, independent,
literate.

213
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:14,604
That lady right there,
she's my fucking hero.

214
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,074
Karen. It's Marla.

215
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,661
Pull the trigger
on Jennifer Peterson.

216
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,163
You'll get the stock you want.

217
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,962
Miss Peterson
is often confused

218
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,007
and has exhibited
memory and coping issues.

219
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,967
Her mobility is compromised.

220
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,678
She cannot take
adequate care of herself,

221
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:50,307
and I believe she is at high
risk if left alone in her own home.

222
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,058
She has no family?

223
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,186
She has no one to care for her,
except us.

224
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,065
That's terrible. Poor woman.

225
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,736
Okay, Miss Grayson.

226
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,488
Do you think you can take
her on as one of your wards?

227
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,241
I know you have a lot
in your fold already.

228
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,492
Um...

229
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,124
Yes, Your Honor, I...

230
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:18,627
If you need me
to take care of her,

231
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,128
I can take care of her.

232
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,756
Thank you, Marla.

233
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,766
Miss Peterson?
My name is Marla Grayson.

234
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,477
I work with Dr. Karen Amos,
your physician.

235
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,063
May I speak with you
for a minute?

236
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:27,320
Good morning, Miss Peterson.
I'm sorry to disturb you so early.

237
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,406
- You're a doctor?
- No, ma'am.

238
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,824
May I show you this?

239
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,538
Oh, I'm gonna need my
reading glasses. I'll be right back.

240
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,555
You know,
I'm not sure what this is.

241
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,016
- It's a court order, ma'am.
- A court order?

242
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,227
But what's that
got to do with me?

243
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,438
That's your name, correct?
Jennifer Peterson.

244
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,400
Your date of birth, social
security number and this address.

245
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,777
Oh, my goodness.
Have I done something wrong?

246
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,988
Oh, no, ma'am.
This is to help you.

247
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,574
The court has ruled, under
the guidance of your doctor,

248
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,410
that you require assistance
in taking care of yourself.

249
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,163
The court has appointed me
to be your legal guardian.

250
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,873
What?

251
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,125
When we cease to be able
to take care of ourselves,

252
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,918
the state steps in to help.

253
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,629
We can't just sit by
while people struggle.

254
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,093
Yeah, but I'm not struggling.

255
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm fine. I'm more than fine.
I don't need help.

256
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm afraid it's not
up to you or me to decide.

257
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:42,687
The court has ruled that you do
need help and, as your legal guardian,

258
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:46,983
it's my duty to ensure that adequate
care is supplied to you at all times.

259
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068
Let me tell you something.
I never went to court.

260
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:51,196
This is the first thing
I've heard about court.

261
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,072
In emergencies,
the court can convene

262
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,116
without the presence
of the prospective ward.

263
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,076
Wow. That's crazy.

264
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,453
Well, ma'am...

265
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,246
You have to come with me.

266
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,916
- I'm not going anywhere.
- This is a court order.

267
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,878
And if you don't comply with it, I'm
afraid you may be in some trouble.

268
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,467
Oh, my God.

269
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,971
If you feel
there's been an error,

270
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,182
report it to the court,
request a hearing.

271
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,017
But, for now,

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,228
I suggest you come with me
temporarily

273
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,355
to the care facility
I've found for you,

274
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,650
and if there's been a mistake,
we can address it from there.

275
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,902
This is Frances. She will
help you pack a suitcase.

276
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,071
Good morning, Mrs. Peterson.
Pleasure to meet you.

277
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:36,157
- I don't believe this is happening.
- It's totally fine.

278
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,368
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry. I'll help you.

279
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,161
Don't touch me.

280
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,415
Beautiful house, Mrs. Peterson.

281
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,428
Let me help you with those.

282
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,473
I'll be overseeing the upkeep of
your property until you sort this out.

283
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,433
Let's go.
We just wanna make sure

284
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,811
that your property's
taken care of safely.

285
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,483
Thanks, Curtis. Seat belt.

286
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,135
Marla, how's it going? You
have to drag her out by her ankles?

287
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:40,471
No, she packed and walked.
Hardly any of them fight.

288
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,892
They see the official paper, they
see the cops, they go right along.

289
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,227
- Yeah, I'd fucking fight.
- You say that,

290
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:50,231
but at heart most of us are
weak, compliant and scared.

291
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:54,110
True. Hey, you ever hear
about the Milgram experiment?

292
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,821
Not now, Sam.
We're already in transit.

293
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,407
- All right.
- Oh, Sam.

294
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,534
I need the full works
for this one.

295
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,952
Copy that.

296
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,147
Welcome home.

297
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,775
Come on in.

298
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,736
Wow.

299
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,739
- I'd forgotten how big they are.
- Yes.

300
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,909
Why don't you take a seat?

301
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,122
So you feel at home.

302
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,375
They have all your medical
details, all your prescriptions.

303
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,961
You don't have to worry.
They'll take care of all of it.

304
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:41,134
Now, if you need me at any time,
night or day, you just ask, okay?

305
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,136
You have a cell phone?

306
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,514
Unlock it.
I'll store my number.

307
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,737
If you need to make a call,
you just ask, okay?

308
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:06,409
Now, Miss Peterson, I wanna
say I'm honored to be your guardian.

309
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,788
And remember, I'm
on your side. I'm here to help.

310
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,210
Sam, you treat this lady
like a queen. You hear me?

311
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,087
- Anything she wants.
- Absolutely.

312
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,800
You take care, Miss Peterson.
We'll talk soon.

313
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,106
Can you open the door?
I just wanna get some air.

314
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,983
- You gotta go that way.
- I just wanna get some air.

315
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,694
Could you open the door
so I can get some air?

316
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:26,030
- You gotta go back that way.
- Huh?

317
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,074
- Sorry?
- I just need to get you back...

318
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,855
Hey, can you grab those?

319
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,072
Thank you, sir.
It's been a pleasure.

320
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,124
Sold.

321
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,811
God, I love your ass.

322
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,531
Hi. I wondered
if you could help me, please.

323
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:53,367
I need my cell phone.
Could you find it for me?

324
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,956
Miss Peterson, cell phones are kept
secure for the safety of our guests.

325
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,002
- My cell phone won't hurt you.
- Our policy is to get your guardian involved.

326
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,922
No, no, no, no.
I don't want my guardian.

327
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,342
- Can I speak to the manager?
- Mr. Rice is unavailable.

328
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,094
Mr. Rice is here,
but he's unavailable.

329
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,763
Mr. Rice!

330
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,057
- Calm down.
- Don't touch me.

331
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,352
- Why are you touching me like this?
- Everything's gonna be fine.

332
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,438
Go away from me. No, no, no,
don't let her do that.

333
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,649
- Calm down.
- Don't let her do that to me.

334
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,202
Nice to see you.

335
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,959
Okay.

336
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,586
Is this the key to one of
your safety deposit boxes?

337
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,138
Taxi for Miss Peterson.

338
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,766
Oh, she doesn't live here
anymore.

339
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,392
What?

340
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,146
She moved.
Miss Peterson moved.

341
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,652
Oh. My mistake. Thank you.

342
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,867
Excuse me. Who called you?

343
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,119
Excuse me!

344
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,670
Fuck.

345
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,824
Sir, he's alone.

346
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,429
So, where is she?

347
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,766
She wasn't at the house.

348
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,227
- You were there on time?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

349
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:35,191
Mm... No. In seven years, she's
never missed an appointment.

350
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:41,530
The house was changed, uh...

351
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,158
It had been, um, cleared out

352
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:48,412
and there was
a "For Sale" sign out front.

353
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:51,040
There's people inside.
They were painting walls.

354
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,250
I spoke to a woman
with some swatches

355
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:56,629
and she said that
she didn't live there anymore.

356
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,426
I don't understand.

357
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,596
What people were in there?
Where is she now?

358
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,557
Oh, I don't know.
I came straight here.

359
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,728
You didn't think to ask?

360
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,022
Even though you know
how important this is to me,

361
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:19,151
you didn't think to get some
basic information on the situation?

362
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,766
Sir, if...

363
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,869
Please, sir... Please.

364
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,664
I figured...
I would... Before any...

365
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,667
You fucked up, Alexi.

366
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:23,882
I love my mother very much.

367
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:27,428
And these days, these rare days
that we get to spend together,

368
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,388
are a blessing for me.

369
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,765
Yes, sir. Of course.

370
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,768
So, you find her
and bring her to me.

371
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,564
- Now.
- Of course. Yes, sir.

372
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,959
And I open the pouch,
and what's inside?

373
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:02,046
Diamonds. Lots.

374
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,340
- Just loose diamonds?
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,467
This is her insurance
for the safe deposit box.

376
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:09,428
She lists the gold,
the jewelry, the bonds,

377
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,555
but not the diamonds.

378
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,308
She insures a $600 watch,

379
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,269
but not millions of dollars'
worth of diamonds.

380
00:32:17,353 --> 00:32:19,146
Do you think they're stolen?

381
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,023
Probably.

382
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,733
She doesn't seem that type.

383
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,693
Don't get fooled by old people.

384
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,446
Even sadistic,
immoral assholes get old.

385
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:33,077
But you're missing the point.
These diamonds don't officially exist.

386
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,579
So...

387
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,999
no one would ever miss them.

388
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:54,431
- You wanna steal them.
- No.

389
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,061
I wanna change their location
for a while for safekeeping...

390
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,940
and see what happens.

391
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,221
Yes?

392
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,557
Sorry, sir.
I can come back later if...

393
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,940
Did you find my mother?

394
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,819
Sort of.

395
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,239
She's in a care home?

396
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,200
As far as I can tell, sir.
I couldn't get access.

397
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,918
Sir, the latest batch of mules
arrived this morning.

398
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,635
- Did we lose any in transit?
- Three.

399
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,514
We're getting the product from
the others at the Medfield property.

400
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,600
Is that my smoothie?

401
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,151
I don't understand.

402
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:34,323
She checked herself
into a care home?

403
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,535
No. Uh, she's there
by court order.

404
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,746
She's now a ward of the state.

405
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,123
Your... Your mother's doctor

406
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:46,001
deemed her incapable
of taking care of herself.

407
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,215
But that's bullshit.

408
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,300
Yes, sir. Yes.

409
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:55,344
So how did this happen?

410
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,888
Um...

411
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,601
Marla Grayson.

412
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,814
I believe she made it happen.
She's your mother's guardian.

413
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:11,485
She now has full control of
your mother's life and assets.

414
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,778
Fuck!

415
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,418
Call Dean.

416
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,297
Get my mother out of that home
and keep her out.

417
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,842
Do it quietly,

418
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,927
do it legally, do it fast.

419
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,470
Keep me away from it.

420
00:35:38,554 --> 00:35:39,763
Yes, sir.

421
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,977
No, no, no, no.
Leave the photograph.

422
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,780
Marla Grayson?
Pleasure to meet you.

423
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,617
- Dean Ericson.
- He says he has an appointment.

424
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,661
- He's not in the book.
- I need five minutes of your time.

425
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,413
It's very important.

426
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,916
You can have two minutes.

427
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:01,595
This is a beautiful office.
Very stylish.

428
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,347
These all your wards?

429
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,683
What can I do for you,
Mr. Ericson?

430
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:10,270
That must be a hell of a
responsibility, all these people.

431
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:13,857
I imagine the paperwork
is brutal.

432
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,526
Take a seat, get to the point.

433
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,487
- I'm a lawyer.
- I don't need a lawyer.

434
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,364
I represent Jennifer Peterson.

435
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,533
- Really?
- Yes. And I think there's been a mistake.

436
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:26,620
You see, my client is very
capable of taking care of herself.

437
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,081
She has no need for the care
of a guardian like yourself.

438
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,500
Of course, this is
no reflection on you.

439
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:35,337
I'm sure you're providing absolutely
stellar care for Miss Peterson.

440
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,257
But the fact of the matter is she
does not need nor want your care.

441
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,510
She was perfectly fine
on her own.

442
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,804
- She called you?
- What?

443
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,889
Jennifer called you
from the facility?

444
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,183
She did.

445
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,561
Hmm. When did you
last see Jennifer?

446
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,105
- Not long ago.
- How long ago?

447
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,692
- Just a few weeks.
- A few? Two, three, four?

448
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:01,113
Three, maybe four... Three.
And she was fine, more than fine.

449
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:04,616
She was fitter and more focused
than I am most of the time.

450
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm afraid
that explains it.

451
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:11,623
Two weeks ago Jennifer's health
took a severe downwards turn.

452
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:14,793
She has memory loss
indicative of dementia.

453
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,837
And her doctor
was so worried about her,

454
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,840
she referred her to the courts
for emergency help.

455
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,598
That's simply not true,
Miss Grayson.

456
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:35,313
You know it, I know it. If the
doctor wrote a note, he knows it too.

457
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,773
- She.
- What?

458
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,483
She. The doctor,
she's a she.

459
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,819
Of course.

460
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,947
Now, I know what you do here.

461
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:46,074
I know your game, your hustle.

462
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,535
- You do?
- I do, and honestly, it's a good one.

463
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,454
You saw an opportunity
and you grabbed it.

464
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,748
Look at all these cash cows
on your wall

465
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,543
just leaking money into your
account one overpriced hour at a time.

466
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,754
Good for you. I'm not here
to ruin your business.

467
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:01,465
I'm happy for you to keep milking
these poor vulnerable people

468
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,009
for as long as you
damn well please.

469
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:08,430
Hell, if your whole enterprise isn't the
perfect example of the American dream,

470
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,890
I don't know what is.

471
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,894
But not Jennifer Peterson.
She's off-limits.

472
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,271
And I understand
why you targeted her.

473
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,982
I just responded to a call
from a doctor.

474
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,152
Right, sure, let's stick with
that. But her doctor is mistaken.

475
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:26,865
Understand? He...
Sorry, she fucked up.

476
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,410
Jennifer needs to be released
from your care ASAP

477
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:34,164
and you need to get that
she-doctor to write another letter

478
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,291
saying Jennifer has made
a full recovery

479
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,336
and no longer needs to be
in the care of a guardian.

480
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,965
Now, why the fuck
would I do that?

481
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:52,057
Well, I can think
of two reasons.

482
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,017
One, it is
the right thing to do,

483
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:56,186
but I doubt that means
anything to you.

484
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:01,858
And two, because she has
very powerful... friends

485
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,027
who can make life
uncomfortable for you,

486
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:07,405
extremely unpleasant
and uncomfortable.

487
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,039
- Is that a threat?
- No.

488
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:20,043
No, that's just data
for you to... collate.

489
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,004
How uncomfortable
are we talking?

490
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,800
Uh, you know, aggressively
and excessively uncomfortable

491
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,594
and then eventually, well...

492
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,559
let's just say
you'll not be comfortable

493
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,854
or uncomfortable ever again.

494
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,441
- Because I'll be dead?
- Well, I didn't say that.

495
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,196
But we all die, right?

496
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,409
Some of us die sooner in a more
horribly protracted and painful way.

497
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,622
- Who do you work for?
- Jennifer Peterson.

498
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,416
- Liar.
- Excuse me?

499
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,294
Liar. Jennifer did not call you
from the facility.

500
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,755
You think I'm stupid enough to let new
wards anywhere near a working phone?

501
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,550
And I know from her paperwork
her lawyer is a local guy

502
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,802
who deals in family law.

503
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:13,054
And that's not you.
You're a shark,

504
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:16,975
which intrigues me,
and I wanna know who hired you.

505
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,352
- Release her from your care.
- No, Dean.

506
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:21,938
I don't think I will.

507
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,785
I didn't wanna have to do this.

508
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:45,045
It's $150,000 in cash.

509
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,631
Well, that's very pretty.

510
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,507
It's yours when you release her.

511
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,221
You know what I think, Dean?

512
00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:00,060
I think if your opening gambit
is 150 grand,

513
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:03,271
then Jennifer Peterson must
be worth a lot more than that

514
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,065
to whoever it is
who sent you here.

515
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:07,609
I can go to 250.

516
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:11,112
How about... five million?

517
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,324
- Three hundred.
- Million?

518
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:19,079
Thousand. Final offer.

519
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:23,541
Dean, I have a legal duty.

520
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,753
Jennifer Peterson is in need
of my protection.

521
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,757
How can I just abandon her?

522
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:35,845
- Are you saying no?
- I'm saying no.

523
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,974
I'm saying, "No, thank you."

524
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,400
In the days to come,

525
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:52,320
you'll replay this conversation
in your head over and over,

526
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:54,864
and you're gonna wish
you played it differently.

527
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:56,616
Right now look at what you have.

528
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,036
A thriving business,
employees...

529
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:04,457
a nice face, unbroken bones,

530
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:06,543
a life.

531
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,087
When this is through,

532
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,506
you're not gonna have
any of those things.

533
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:13,758
None of them.

534
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,602
- Last chance.
- Goodbye, Dean.

535
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:27,480
Curtis will validate
your parking on the way out.

536
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:46,124
I've looked
all through her records,

537
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,376
all the way back
to her birth certificate.

538
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,087
I can't find anyone in her life
that we should be scared of.

539
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,006
Then who is this lawyer?

540
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,674
Maybe he knows about
the diamonds.

541
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:57,135
Yeah, that's my thought too.

542
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,221
Maybe he's cut in on them.
He's scared we'll find them.

543
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,308
Maybe you should just
take the money.

544
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:07,354
And give away the biggest
opportunity we ever had?

545
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,147
What if he's saying the truth?

546
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,649
- With what?
- With threats.

547
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,903
You know how many times
I've been threatened by a man?

548
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,571
Thousands.

549
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,115
You know how many of them
ever came to anything?

550
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,283
Two.

551
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,496
He made threats 'cause threats
are all he had left.

552
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,248
You can't convince a woman
to do what you want,

553
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:30,168
then you call her a bitch
and threaten to kill her.

554
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,755
I'm not scared of him.

555
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:38,760
Okay.

556
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,721
So, what are you thinking?

557
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:45,350
I'm gonna talk to someone
who has all the answers.

558
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,523
How is she?

559
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:54,943
She's been pretty
unsettled since she got here.

560
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:58,488
- They always are.
- Yeah, but she's extra extra.

561
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,741
The doctor had to adjust her
medication to calm her down.

562
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,493
- Twice.
- Hmm.

563
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,578
She's in the games room.
I have to warn you,

564
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,164
we had to bump her sedatives,
so she might be out of it.

565
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,294
Jennifer.

566
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,464
How are you feeling?

567
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:20,260
- Why do I know you?
- I'm your guardian, Marla.

568
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:24,973
Oh, thank God. I need help.
I need my cell phone.

569
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,142
- To call who?
- What?

570
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,978
- Who do you need to call?
- Why?

571
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,107
Jennifer, do you know a man
named Dean Ericson?

572
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,819
- Who? What?
- Dean.

573
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,696
Dean Ericson. You know him?

574
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,073
- Dean... No, I don't.
- No?

575
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,368
He says he works for you.
He says he's a lawyer.

576
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:46,453
Lawyer.

577
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,457
Does he look expensive?

578
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,668
Well... yeah, I guess.

579
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,254
What's the date?

580
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:57,589
The 15th.

581
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,300
Last week was the 8th.

582
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,634
Right on.

583
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,855
You're in trouble now.

584
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:16,441
- Really? Why?
- Yeah.

585
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,485
- He's coming.
- Who? Dean?

586
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,862
No.

587
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,947
He's coming.

588
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,160
- Who?
- Just you wait.

589
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,624
Jennifer, who are you?

590
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,128
So much drugs.

591
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,964
Drugs. I can't think.

592
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:41,674
Tell me who you are.

593
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:44,010
Tell me.

594
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:49,390
You know I have access
to your safety deposit box?

595
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:53,061
I know what's in there.

596
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,899
There's an envelope
inside a book.

597
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,152
Tell me who you are.

598
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:03,196
Oh, you're a robber.

599
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,740
No, I'm your guardian.

600
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,700
You're my guardian robber.

601
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:09,827
- Tell me who you are.
- Ooh.

602
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,789
Jennifer. Jennifer.
Tell me.

603
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,792
I'm the worst mistake
you'll ever make.

604
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,461
Tell me.

605
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:21,214
- Tell me.
- Cell phone.

606
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,383
Tell me.

607
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,344
You don't give me my cell phone,

608
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,013
you don't let me
get out of this place...

609
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,019
I got nothing to say.

610
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,398
- Listen to me.
- Nothing.

611
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:44,571
I control your drugs,
your food, your comfort.

612
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,366
Everything. Me.

613
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:49,951
- Not you, me.
- Yeah.

614
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,954
And I can make things
very bad for you.

615
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,330
You hear me?

616
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,041
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

617
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:02,630
Then have at it,
you little crock of cunt.

618
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:04,716
Have at it.

619
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,314
Excuse me. Uh...

620
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:26,738
Marla Grayson, my favorite lady.

621
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:29,657
Sam, I want you to adjust
Jennifer Peterson's routine.

622
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:31,409
Shoot.

623
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,411
Take her arthritis
and pain meds down to minimum,

624
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,788
push her physical exercise
to grade four level.

625
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:37,874
- Marla...
- Give her an upper at 9:00 at night,

626
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,667
then sedatives in the day.

627
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,836
Put her on
the basic food package.

628
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,963
No solids,
just oatmeal and soup.

629
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,215
No games, no TV

630
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:49,093
and only 30 minutes a day
out of her room.

631
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,971
Are you sure?

632
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,807
I'm sure as fucking sure.

633
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,311
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sam.

634
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,395
Yeah.

635
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:13,886
Your Honor, Jennifer Peterson is being
held against her will in a care facility.

636
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:17,473
She was put there by this woman
who has falsely asserted

637
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:21,769
that Jennifer is of ill health
when, in fact, she's perfectly fine.

638
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:24,564
Who are you, sir? I've not
seen you in here before.

639
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,817
Dean Ericson, Your Honor.
These are my associates.

640
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,903
We represent the interests
of Jennifer Peterson,

641
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:33,823
and I'm here to undo
a miscarriage of justice.

642
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,326
Are you saying I am responsible
for a miscarriage of justice?

643
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,329
Not deliberately, Your Honor.
You were lied to.

644
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,208
My client was not invited

645
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,462
to the original hearing, and
neither was her representative.

646
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,047
That's perfectly normal
for an emergency hearing.

647
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,341
But there was no emergency
in this case.

648
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,677
It was a fiction
created by Miss Grayson

649
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:58,055
to keep Jennifer out of sight
and trick the court.

650
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:03,478
I have an affidavit here from an
ex-employee from Dr. Amos' practice

651
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,438
who testifies to the fact

652
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:09,317
that Miss Grayson and Dr. Amos
regularly colluded on cases

653
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,860
to game the system.

654
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:16,449
I quote: "Karen would palm off
difficult patients to Marla

655
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:19,118
whether they needed
a guardian or not

656
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,872
and then embellish symptoms
to sway the court."

657
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,334
Your Honor...

658
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,464
this is scandalous.

659
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,132
Judge, may I?

660
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,393
Fiona Jacobs is your witness?

661
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:47,772
Yes. She's the employee, yes.

662
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,525
Judge, you know
Fiona hates Karen.

663
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,819
She's not an impartial witness.

664
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,904
Fiona has a vendetta
against Karen

665
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,865
because Karen fired her
for being useless at her job.

666
00:51:57,949 --> 00:51:59,951
Or maybe Karen fired her

667
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,495
because she uncovered the
true nature of your operation.

668
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,372
I know Fiona. She was useless.

669
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:11,963
Judge, can I ask why Jennifer
is again not present today?

670
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,132
Jennifer is unwell. I'm
afraid she's unable to attend.

671
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:18,636
I have submitted a letter from her
current doctor attesting to that fact.

672
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,305
Also I've been denied
any access to her, Judge.

673
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:25,017
It's as if Miss Grayson has
purposely just kept me away from her.

674
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,019
Have you denied
him access, Marla?

675
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:29,438
You can't deny an attorney
access to his client.

676
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:31,816
This man claims
to be her lawyer.

677
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:35,278
He can produce no piece of paper
to prove it. No contract, no retainer.

678
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:38,948
He just suddenly appeared in my
office making threats and accusations.

679
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,451
Your Honor, more than once you
and I have seen unscrupulous lawyers

680
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:46,414
seeking to exploit the elderly
for their hard-earned savings.

681
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:50,543
I think this is why Mr. Ericson wants
Miss Peterson out of my protection.

682
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,087
That's the exact opposite
of what is happening.

683
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,841
Can you present any paperwork that
proves you are Miss Peterson's lawyer?

684
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,010
If I could just
get access to her,

685
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,053
I guarantee you,
she would sign a retainer.

686
00:53:01,137 --> 00:53:03,389
So Jennifer Peterson hasn't
retained you as her lawyer?

687
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,850
I am acting on behalf
of concerned parties

688
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,935
who are extremely worried
about Jennifer

689
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,354
and the outrageous treatment
she's been given.

690
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:11,898
Who are these concerned parties?

691
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,150
I'm not at liberty
to reveal that information.

692
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,736
They are friends of Miss Peterson
who wish to remain anonymous.

693
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,696
Sir, we're going around
in circles.

694
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:20,573
Either you show me
some paperwork

695
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,159
that proves you are
Miss Peterson's lawyer

696
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,871
or you bring these concerned
parties into a hearing

697
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,123
and let them speak
for themselves.

698
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,334
But for now, Mr. Ericson,

699
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:35,171
your request to dissolve
this guardianship is denied.

700
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,009
Sir. Sir. Sir.

701
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,261
Look... Whoa!

702
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:45,514
Okay! It's family court, okay?

703
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:48,726
The judge is an asshole. He's
an idiot. He doesn't even know law.

704
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,313
- He drives a fucking Subaru!
- Stop talking!

705
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,565
Stop!

706
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:57,693
Fuck this.

707
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,229
Good morning.

708
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:35,064
Good morning.

709
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:37,233
My name is Walter Smith.

710
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,736
These are my brothers,
Tony and Chad.

711
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,240
I spoke to your manager,
Mr. Rice, this morning

712
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:46,659
about a tour of the facility.

713
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,370
Great. I'll get him
on the phone for you.

714
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,871
Thank you.

715
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,958
- Mr. Smith?
- Mr. Smith, yeah.

716
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,045
- Marla.
- Mm-hmm?

717
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,172
- She's dead.
- Who?

718
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,674
Jennifer Peterson's dead.

719
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:02,842
What?

720
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,762
- When?
- In 1949.

721
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:09,807
When she was three months
and nine days, from polio.

722
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:13,477
The woman we have
isn't Jennifer Peterson.

723
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,522
She just stole the identity
of a dead child.

724
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,753
And look at this.

725
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,800
I found an obituary of the
dead girl in an old newspaper.

726
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:48,387
And, of course,
we have superb medical staff

727
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:50,306
and facilities on site.

728
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:54,143
- So, any questions?
- Actually, yes.

729
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,646
My father has a friend
who's a resident here.

730
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:00,941
We'd love if we could say a
quick hello. It would mean a lot.

731
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,445
- Oh, of course. What is the name?
- Jennifer Peterson.

732
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:11,118
- Is there a problem?
- No, uh... Jennifer's been unwell. She's resting.

733
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:14,872
We'll be very quick. We promised
our father. You understand.

734
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:18,542
Of course. The thing is,
Jennifer's guardian has stipulated

735
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:21,962
that she have
only approved visitors.

736
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:28,052
That's odd. She sounds a bit
more like a prisoner than a guest.

737
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,764
No. No, um...

738
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,599
No.

739
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:36,435
Um... tell you what.

740
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:41,190
Why don't I try and get Jennifer's guardian
on the phone and see what I can do?

741
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:42,650
Of course.

742
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:52,910
- Hey! Hey, what did you do to him?
- Oh, shit.

743
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,704
- Find her! Go!
- Somebody help Mr. Rice!

744
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,248
- Help!
- Gerry!

745
00:56:58,124 --> 00:56:59,375
Oh, shit!

746
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,003
Lock it down. Lock it down.

747
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,677
- Then who do we have?
- I don't know.

748
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,471
This stolen identity
is incredibly sophisticated.

749
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,683
We're talking about passports,
driver's license, employment,

750
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,186
tax records going back 40 years.

751
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,231
They've scrubbed all trace
of the real Jennifer Peterson,

752
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,358
including her death certificate.

753
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,699
Marla Grayson. Yeah.

754
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,161
Fuck. I'm on my way.

755
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:46,297
Madam.

756
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,341
Madam?

757
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,177
Chad.

758
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,680
Thank you.

759
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,183
Madam!

760
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,228
Get down on the ground!

761
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,234
Madam?

762
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:08,611
Hello?

763
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:15,451
Out of the way!
Get out of the way!

764
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,871
About fucking time.

765
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:53,822
Open the door.

766
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,783
- You don't wanna do this.
- Open it!

767
00:58:55,866 --> 00:59:00,704
Listen to me. I am prepared
to kill you to get out of here.

768
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,082
Are you prepared to die
to stop me, hmm?

769
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:09,046
I didn't think so.

770
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:12,675
Thank you.

771
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,393
Right this way, madam.

772
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:24,270
Hi.

773
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,441
- Get the fuck off me!
- That way.

774
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,363
Fuck you.

775
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,619
- We got you. We got you.
- No, you don't.

776
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,496
Yeah, vacation is over.

777
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:51,422
Let's go.

778
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,680
Get down.

779
01:00:22,578 --> 01:00:24,288
What is your name?

780
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,712
Why'd you wanna kidnap
that little old lady?

781
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,633
Wanna make your phone call?

782
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,014
Want a doughnut?

783
01:00:47,436 --> 01:00:49,897
He doesn't know it yet,
but we found him in our system.

784
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,358
- He's done time before.
- Who is he?

785
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:55,986
Alexi Ignatyev.
Brother of Nicholas Ignatyev

786
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,947
who was once a brigadier
in the Cleveland Russian mafia.

787
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,825
- Was?
- Hmm. Nicholas died seven years ago in a fire,

788
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:04,787
along with his boss,
Roman Lunyov.

789
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,414
It was arson, a hit.
They'd been caught skimming.

790
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,625
These assholes
were drug smugglers

791
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,835
and implicated
in a bunch of murders.

792
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:15,214
We thought Alexi died in
the fire too, but here he is,

793
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,466
trying to kidnap your ward.

794
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:19,927
- Who is she anyway, your ward?
- Nobody.

795
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,762
She's a retired businesswoman.

796
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,014
- Rich?
- So-so.

797
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:27,434
Well, maybe it was just
a stickup job.

798
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:30,145
You guys did good stopping him.
This guy's a bad dude.

799
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:34,149
Do me a favor. Keep us in the
loop if you hear anything else.

800
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,443
- Hmm. Sure thing, Frankie.
- Lou?

801
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:39,488
Don't call me Frankie.

802
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:41,824
You used to like
being called Frankie.

803
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:44,034
Yeah, not anymore.

804
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,290
- Frankie?
- It used to be a thing for a second.

805
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,500
I like it.

806
01:01:51,583 --> 01:01:52,668
- Frankie.
- No.

807
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,484
Yeah. It's me.

808
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:20,737
I need something.

809
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,332
Oh. Hello.

810
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:37,004
Sorry. I'm just closing up.
Did you have an appointment?

811
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:47,931
Let's go live now to
Lucille O'Mara who is at the scene.

812
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:53,812
The well-loved family doctor was
found dead at her place of work.

813
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:57,566
Dr. Karen Amos was a highly
popular and respected doctor...

814
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:13,415
Police will not yet confirm
that it was suicide.

815
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,108
- Fran?
- Marla?

816
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,945
- You heard about Karen.
- Yeah. Oh, my God, baby.

817
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:46,490
Quick, pack a bag.

818
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,700
We gotta go. If they killed
her, they're coming for us.

819
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:51,537
We don't know they killed her.
Karen may have had trouble.

820
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:53,539
Oh, really?
Do you believe that?

821
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:59,545
Okay, then. Marla, I don't
want you to get shot in the head.

822
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:03,006
- I don't wanna get shot either.
- So we don't get shot in the head.

823
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,051
We went after Jennifer Peterson
because she was a cherry

824
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,053
with no strings attached, baby.

825
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,596
But she's a spider web,

826
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,181
and we're gonna get
trapped in it.

827
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:13,517
Well, maybe, but maybe not.

828
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,520
They brought guns into a care
home. They're the Russian mafia.

829
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:19,398
- Ex-Russian mafia.
- Marla, pack a fucking bag!

830
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:27,531
Fuck.

831
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,083
Curtis, it's Marla.

832
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,502
Yeah, we saw.

833
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:43,297
I know. I know.

834
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:48,635
Yeah, you should close the
office. Hang tight for a while, okay?

835
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:54,266
Can you send me a list
of all the empty,

836
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:57,102
unsold properties on our books
as soon as you can?

837
01:04:57,185 --> 01:05:00,314
Okay. Thanks. Goodbye.

838
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:18,206
It's gonna be okay.

839
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,154
Jennifer, how are you feeling?

840
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,280
Good.

841
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,658
Heard about Dr. Amos.

842
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:02,334
- Is Alexi your son?
- What? No. That idiot?

843
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:05,754
But you are connected
to the Russian mafia?

844
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:09,007
He'll kill you next.

845
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:13,845
I mean, that is unless
you get me out of here now.

846
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,140
Then he might let you live.

847
01:06:32,114 --> 01:06:34,116
Jennifer,
listen to me carefully.

848
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,246
I don't lose. I won't lose.

849
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,875
I'm never letting you go.

850
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:49,715
I own you.

851
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,884
And I will drain you
of your money, your comfort

852
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:54,803
and your self-respect.

853
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,680
Not because I want to,

854
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,516
not because I'll enjoy it
or because I planned for it,

855
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,644
but because your people
didn't play by the rules.

856
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:08,191
You wanna beat me? Well,
come at me fair and square.

857
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:10,569
You get me in a courtroom.
You outplay me.

858
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,446
You don't bring guns
into a care home.

859
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,823
You don't murder
one of my friends.

860
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,208
This is your life now, Jennifer.

861
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:29,171
You are just another
old lady in a care home,

862
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:33,175
with dementia,
with incontinence,

863
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:35,260
with arthritis.

864
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:39,097
With no one.

865
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:41,767
Except me.

866
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:49,816
Jennifer,

867
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,360
or whoever the hell
you really are...

868
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:55,614
you're gonna die in here.

869
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:59,659
Alone and in terrible pain.

870
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:05,207
Hey! Let her go!

871
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:07,876
Come on. Come on.

872
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,796
There you go. Let her go.
Nice and easy.

873
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,799
Don't. She's the one.

874
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:29,189
Good Lord.
Marla, are you okay?

875
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:32,818
- Did she hurt you?
- Only superficially.

876
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,323
I got lucky.
But what about next time?

877
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:41,868
As you can see, her mental
health has severely deteriorated.

878
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:45,038
As this doctor's note describes,

879
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,709
Miss Peterson has become
delusional, paranoid

880
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,545
and violent.

881
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,839
She's a danger to others
and herself.

882
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:58,009
And her doctor and I recommend
that she be moved immediately

883
01:08:58,093 --> 01:09:00,303
to a secure psychiatric facility

884
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:04,182
where her needs will be
more adequately taken care of.

885
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:06,935
I agree.

886
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,323
Don't worry.

887
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,751
This belong
to one of your wards?

888
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,378
I just need an
approximate valuation, Vee.

889
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:18,757
It's a real nice stone, not the
usual dog shit people bring in.

890
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,510
What are we talking retail?

891
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:26,765
Mm, 175, maybe 200 grand.
It's a nice one.

892
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:29,601
You mind holding on to it,
keep it in your safe?

893
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:32,604
- Is it trouble?
- Oh, no.

894
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,773
No, I have some errands to run.

895
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:36,858
I don't want it in my purse
all day.

896
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:38,068
Thanks.

897
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:44,366
Fran says hello. Oh, she told me
to ask after your brother Mikey.

898
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:51,039
- Mikey?
- Yeah. He still in the trade?

899
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:53,917
Why? You need a fence
for this?

900
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,544
In the future, maybe.

901
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,966
Michael still moves stuff
here and there.

902
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,176
Good to know.

903
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,305
Hey, how'd it go?
Did she take the bait on Mikey?

904
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,849
Oh, yeah.
He may be a solution.

905
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:12,185
- Good.
- Hey.

906
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:15,146
- Did you pack our passports?
- Passports.

907
01:11:15,230 --> 01:11:16,523
Fuck.

908
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,193
Shit, baby. No, I didn't.
Didn't you?

909
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,529
- Fuck. No.
- I'm close to the house.

910
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,572
I can go pick them up
if you want me to.

911
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:27,409
I think we should have them
just in case.

912
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,327
- But be careful.
- Okay.

913
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:32,080
- See you back at the place?
- Yeah, okay.

914
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,748
- Okay.
- Bye.

915
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,760
What happened?
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

916
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:48,680
- I don't know. I think somebody...
- Oh, my God.

917
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:27,529
Hello, Marla Grayson.

918
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:53,847
I don't like you.

919
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,184
You only just met me.

920
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:12,240
You know, you remind me of
someone I knew when I was younger.

921
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:15,368
She was fiery, like you.

922
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:17,871
Amusing, confident.

923
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:20,874
Uncooperative.

924
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,919
I cut all her fingers off
with a bread knife.

925
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:27,547
She's buried underneath
a Jimmy John's now.

926
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,758
Don't underestimate me.

927
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:32,343
Who are you?

928
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,430
A dangerous man.

929
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,766
It says that on
your business card?

930
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,227
You should be scared right now.

931
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:45,064
Why? Are you gonna make
another big fucking speech?

932
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,908
Ow. Jesus fucking Christ.

933
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,292
You stole something from me.

934
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:08,630
Something more than an old lady.
You know what I'm talking about.

935
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,965
Right now I have men
searching for what you stole.

936
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:13,176
They are tearing apart
your office, your home.

937
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:17,138
And if they do not find
what they're looking for,

938
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:20,433
I will tear you apart until
you tell me where they are.

939
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,901
Do you recognize that woman?

940
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,696
That's your mother, isn't it?

941
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:40,286
After I destroy you,
I will destroy her.

942
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:44,624
Go ahead. I don't give a shit
about that fucking sociopath.

943
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:57,887
You know, I...

944
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:01,391
I don't like being angry.

945
01:16:02,976 --> 01:16:04,602
I much prefer to be calm.

946
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:12,068
But you... have compromised a
life I spent years carefully building.

947
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,488
Do you know who I am?

948
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,865
No, but I think I can guess.

949
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:22,036
You're either Nicholas Ignatyev
or Roman Lunyov.

950
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,748
My bet is you're Roman, 'cause you
seem more like a boss than a soldier.

951
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:30,044
So, you faked your own death

952
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:33,673
and then were afraid your Cleveland friends
would use your mother to flush you out,

953
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,633
so you turned her
into Jennifer Peterson.

954
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,888
I'm going to kill you now.

955
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:44,684
Okay.

956
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:48,396
You're not afraid of death?

957
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,648
Do you remember
how scary it was in 1807?

958
01:16:50,732 --> 01:16:54,527
No, me neither
because I wasn't alive yet.

959
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,571
It'll feel the same way
when I'm dead.

960
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,573
Not even nothing.
Why be scared of that?

961
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,160
Anyway, you don't need
to kill me.

962
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:05,038
When you sent that lawyer
with a case full of money,

963
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,707
your instinct was right,
I'm willing to be bought off.

964
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,375
Your man just came in too low.

965
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,253
- Do you have a figure in mind?
- Yeah.

966
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:15,006
I want $10 million.

967
01:17:16,883 --> 01:17:18,885
Of course you do.

968
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:24,223
You are... brave,
Miss Grayson.

969
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:26,851
Stupid, but brave.

970
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:30,229
Well, to make it in this
country, you need to be brave.

971
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:33,149
And stupid and ruthless
and focused.

972
01:17:33,232 --> 01:17:38,237
Because playing fair, being
scared, that gets you nowhere.

973
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:39,864
That gets you beat.

974
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:43,743
You know that.
And I wanna be rich, Mr. Lunyov.

975
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:49,165
I wanna be very...
fucking rich.

976
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:54,837
And my bet is that $10 million,
that's not such a big deal for you.

977
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:57,131
But for me, that's a start.

978
01:17:57,215 --> 01:18:00,676
That's enough to be able
to use money as a weapon,

979
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,929
like a bludgeon,

980
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,014
the way real rich people do.

981
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,642
That's what I want.

982
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,105
- You hold no cards.
- I have your mother and your diamonds.

983
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:14,857
I've made sure that if I die,
you'll never see those diamonds

984
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:18,611
and it'll be so... complicated

985
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,781
to extricate your mother
from her situation...

986
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,910
that it'll take years
before she sees freedom.

987
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:28,913
If she even lives that long.

988
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,250
Just pay me off.

989
01:18:33,626 --> 01:18:35,044
It's the easiest way.

990
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,096
Get rid of her.

991
01:18:47,974 --> 01:18:50,143
Make sure it looks organic.

992
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,768
You got a pay phone?

993
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:27,229
I'll give you $50 if you'll let
me make a call on your cell.

994
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:47,041
Hey, it's Fran.
Leave a message.

995
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,353
Can you call me a cab?

996
01:26:57,671 --> 01:26:59,423
Oh, Fran!

997
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:04,011
Oh, baby! No!

998
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:10,100
Oh, thank God.

999
01:27:41,048 --> 01:27:42,174
Fran?

1000
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:44,093
Fran.

1001
01:27:52,434 --> 01:27:53,477
Marla.

1002
01:27:58,482 --> 01:27:59,525
I thought...

1003
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,738
I thought...
I thought we were dead.

1004
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:08,742
No, we're alive, hon.

1005
01:28:59,293 --> 01:29:01,628
- I'm scared.
- I'm so fucking sorry.

1006
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:02,963
I'm so sorry.

1007
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:15,350
It's okay.

1008
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:31,468
How are you feeling?

1009
01:30:34,888 --> 01:30:35,973
Feeling better.

1010
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:43,355
What's that, Marla?

1011
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,942
It's the license plate of the car
our Russian friend was driving.

1012
01:30:48,152 --> 01:30:50,487
Fran, say the word
and we're gone.

1013
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:53,448
We start again somewhere new.

1014
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:54,825
Just us.

1015
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:56,869
And do what?

1016
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:02,416
We lost everything.

1017
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:06,170
Not quite everything.

1018
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:43,916
We can take them and run.

1019
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:48,170
Or you can make a call
and get me the address

1020
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:50,422
that that license
is registered to.

1021
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:55,177
If we run, we'll always be
looking over our shoulders.

1022
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,597
We'll always be waiting
for him to find us.

1023
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,267
Isn't it better
to finish this now?

1024
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:06,396
You have a plan?

1025
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:11,109
I do.

1026
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:13,070
Will it work?

1027
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,323
I don't know.

1028
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:24,915
Give me the phone.

1029
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,559
Okay, here we are.

1030
01:32:44,643 --> 01:32:47,646
This is the address
for plate F8T 444.

1031
01:32:48,939 --> 01:32:50,232
That one?

1032
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,567
- Yeah.
- He can't live here.

1033
01:32:52,651 --> 01:32:54,486
Maybe the plate was stolen.

1034
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,406
No, the plate definitely
matched a black Yukon.

1035
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:02,661
Go around the back.
I wanna get a closer look.

1036
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:03,532
It's not him, it's his driver.
Go. He's on the move.

1037
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:07,994
There. Follow him.

1038
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,484
He's pulling up.

1039
01:35:56,042 --> 01:35:58,044
Sir, your car is downstairs.

1040
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:13,101
Be careful.

1041
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:37,709
Hi. Uh... I have
an appointment with, uh...

1042
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:41,129
Mr. Naylor
at Galen and Hersch.

1043
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:43,965
It's on the third floor,
I think.

1044
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:48,845
I'm actually a little early.

1045
01:36:48,929 --> 01:36:51,431
Uh, is there a restroom
I could use while I'm waiting?

1046
01:36:51,515 --> 01:36:54,851
Sure. Right around this corner
and to your left.

1047
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:55,977
Thanks.

1048
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:37,561
Hi. Can you help me?

1049
01:37:37,644 --> 01:37:40,146
I think I'm on
totally the wrong level,

1050
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,524
and I can't find the exit.
Is this B1?

1051
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:45,360
This is level 2. The exit's back
that way around the corner.

1052
01:37:45,443 --> 01:37:47,070
Can't I use that elevator?

1053
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,406
That's a private elev...

1054
01:38:13,346 --> 01:38:15,390
Where is Jackson?

1055
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,434
Hello again.

1056
01:38:17,517 --> 01:38:18,893
Sir?

1057
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:20,854
Hey!

1058
01:39:17,077 --> 01:39:18,745
Is he in there?

1059
01:39:18,828 --> 01:39:21,331
Lying in a pool
of his own urine.

1060
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:31,341
You wanna go get rid of him?

1061
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:32,717
Lead the way.

1062
01:40:07,293 --> 01:40:10,338
How much do you think
he weighs? A hundred pounds?

1063
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:11,840
110, yeah.

1064
01:40:16,886 --> 01:40:18,680
Sleep tight,
motherfucker.

1065
01:42:59,465 --> 01:43:03,011
There you are.
How are you feeling?

1066
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:09,225
Don't try to talk.
You have a tube in your throat.

1067
01:43:17,901 --> 01:43:19,402
See that?

1068
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,571
You're a John Doe.

1069
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,323
You nearly died of an overdose.

1070
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:25,450
You're lucky
they found you in time.

1071
01:43:26,576 --> 01:43:28,912
You wanna hear
an interesting fact?

1072
01:43:28,995 --> 01:43:31,372
When an incapacitated
John Doe is found,

1073
01:43:31,456 --> 01:43:34,125
the state automatically
appoints them a legal guardian

1074
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:36,377
to oversee their treatment
and welfare.

1075
01:43:37,545 --> 01:43:39,839
You know where
this is going, right?

1076
01:43:49,015 --> 01:43:51,017
I'm now your legal guardian.

1077
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:59,651
I got you, John Doe.

1078
01:43:59,734 --> 01:44:02,403
I can do whatever
I want with you.

1079
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:06,199
Let's find a nurse to get
that tube out of your throat

1080
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:10,870
so you can arrange for $10
million to be moved into my account.

1081
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:18,336
Ding-dong.

1082
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,989
How's the throat?

1083
01:44:46,072 --> 01:44:48,700
Still painful.

1084
01:44:48,783 --> 01:44:51,327
I know
you don't like losing.

1085
01:44:51,411 --> 01:44:55,873
But as your guardian, I suggest
you swallow your pride and pay me off.

1086
01:44:58,376 --> 01:45:04,507
You can have your mother,
your diamonds, your freedom.

1087
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:06,592
You'll never see me again.

1088
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:10,930
Even if I pay you off,

1089
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:13,641
are you not afraid
I'll still kill you?

1090
01:45:15,143 --> 01:45:16,936
I'm not afraid, no.

1091
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:22,316
- I can make it happen easily.
- I know.

1092
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:26,279
But I could just as easily kill you
if this thing continues any longer.

1093
01:45:32,035 --> 01:45:33,411
Okay.

1094
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:36,789
- Okay?
- Let's end this now.

1095
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:41,252
I'll give you the $10 million.

1096
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:42,795
I can arrange that.

1097
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,842
- However...
- However?

1098
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:51,763
I'd like to propose
an alternative.

1099
01:45:53,473 --> 01:45:57,226
Instead of me giving you
$10 million...

1100
01:45:59,062 --> 01:46:04,192
we become partners,
go into business together.

1101
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:07,653
- Are you fucking with me?
- No, I'm serious.

1102
01:46:07,737 --> 01:46:10,948
I mean... I hate you...

1103
01:46:12,450 --> 01:46:15,995
but, oh,
the money we could make.

1104
01:46:18,915 --> 01:46:21,250
You're a rare person, Marla.

1105
01:46:21,334 --> 01:46:24,670
Your determination is...
Frankly, it's scary.

1106
01:46:24,754 --> 01:46:27,548
But this guardianship grift,

1107
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:30,009
it's ripe,

1108
01:46:30,093 --> 01:46:32,595
but right now
it's small potatoes.

1109
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:37,308
I propose we create a monster...

1110
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:41,229
a countrywide
guardianship corporation,

1111
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:44,398
with you as CEO and co-owner.

1112
01:46:45,817 --> 01:46:48,820
Use my money, use your...

1113
01:46:51,155 --> 01:46:52,657
skills.

1114
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:57,078
Destroy the competition.

1115
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,540
Take control
of the entire market.

1116
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:02,333
You wanna start
a company with me?

1117
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:04,585
Not just one company,

1118
01:47:04,669 --> 01:47:08,548
a corporation with 80 different
companies, all registered offshore,

1119
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:11,425
charging each other invoices,
burying profit.

1120
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:13,928
A real estate arm, a legal arm,
a training arm,

1121
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:16,430
a medical arm,
a pharmaceutical arm.

1122
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:19,475
- Our own chain of care homes.
- Exactly.

1123
01:47:19,559 --> 01:47:22,854
With thousands of guardians
working for us.

1124
01:47:22,937 --> 01:47:27,441
With hundreds of thousands
of wards in our care.

1125
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:30,403
That way, you win.

1126
01:47:32,071 --> 01:47:34,157
But I win too.

1127
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,243
And we make each other
billions of dollars.

1128
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:39,620
Legally.

1129
01:47:41,747 --> 01:47:42,957
Mostly.

1130
01:47:45,501 --> 01:47:47,086
What about the diamonds?

1131
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:49,213
Fuck the diamonds.

1132
01:47:51,215 --> 01:47:53,217
Split them, 50-50.

1133
01:47:54,051 --> 01:47:55,887
How do we trust each other?

1134
01:47:55,970 --> 01:48:00,808
If we make each other rich,
the trust will follow.

1135
01:48:08,357 --> 01:48:10,359
So, are you in?

1136
01:48:22,288 --> 01:48:26,417
Every fortune ever
accumulated started with a leap of faith.

1137
01:48:28,461 --> 01:48:30,504
But before you take that leap...

1138
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:36,594
first take a long,
hard look at yourself.

1139
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:44,310
Know who you are.

1140
01:48:57,573 --> 01:48:59,367
Ask yourself:

1141
01:49:00,576 --> 01:49:02,411
am I an insider?

1142
01:49:03,412 --> 01:49:05,248
Or am I an outsider?

1143
01:49:13,506 --> 01:49:15,132
Am I a lamb?

1144
01:49:17,218 --> 01:49:18,719
Or am I a lion?

1145
01:49:21,013 --> 01:49:22,556
Am I a predator?

1146
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:26,352
Or am I prey?

1147
01:49:28,896 --> 01:49:30,898
Am I good at money?

1148
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:34,318
Or am I good at people?

1149
01:49:36,988 --> 01:49:41,367
What am I willing to sacrifice
to achieve my dreams?

1150
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:44,370
Marla Grayson, CEO and founder.

1151
01:49:45,538 --> 01:49:47,665
What lines
will I not cross?

1152
01:49:53,296 --> 01:49:54,714
Don't try to be anyone else.

1153
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:57,883
Just know who you are

1154
01:49:57,967 --> 01:49:59,552
and use that to your advantage.

1155
01:50:03,723 --> 01:50:05,057
So, who are you?

1156
01:50:06,684 --> 01:50:08,602
Me?

1157
01:50:09,687 --> 01:50:11,605
I'm just someone who cares.

1158
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:23,117
So, are you lion or a lamb?

1159
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:27,288
I'm a lioness.

1160
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:29,749
And I will do
whatever I need to do

1161
01:50:29,832 --> 01:50:32,376
to protect the people
I care about.

1162
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:41,886
You've had amazing
success in such a short period of time.

1163
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:43,804
Marla, what's your secret?

1164
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:46,515
Whoo! Whoo!

1165
01:50:46,599 --> 01:50:48,642
There is no secret, Peter.

1166
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:52,104
All it takes is hard work

1167
01:50:52,188 --> 01:50:55,816
and the courage and
determination to never give up.

1168
01:51:07,745 --> 01:51:09,997
So now you are a rich woman.

1169
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:13,417
How much are you worth? How
much do you have in the bank?

1170
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:15,711
You were great.

1171
01:51:15,795 --> 01:51:19,006
My cheeks are aching
from forcing that smile for so long.

1172
01:51:20,257 --> 01:51:21,592
I haven't counted recently.

1173
01:51:24,637 --> 01:51:28,099
But you are firmly in the
top slice of the one percent.

1174
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:31,685
- What should we do now?
- Whatever the fuck we want.

1175
01:51:31,769 --> 01:51:33,270
Hey, bitch!

1176
01:51:33,354 --> 01:51:34,814
And you're still only 39.

1177
01:51:34,897 --> 01:51:36,190
That must feel good.

1178
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:37,817
Hey, bitch!

1179
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:44,281
- Oh, listen. I don't have time...
- Marla!

1180
01:51:45,533 --> 01:51:47,159
No! Security!

1181
01:51:47,243 --> 01:51:48,494
My mom died!

1182
01:51:48,577 --> 01:51:50,746
Help! Help!

1183
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:53,833
You never let me see her! She
died in there alone! You fucking bitch!

1184
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:57,378
- Drop the weapon!
- Fucking bitch!

1185
01:51:57,461 --> 01:52:00,297
Someone call help! Marla?

1186
01:52:00,381 --> 01:52:02,883
Baby, you're gonna be fine.
No, no, no.

1187
01:52:02,967 --> 01:52:05,886
Look at me, baby.
Look at me. Look at me.

1188
01:52:05,970 --> 01:52:09,932
Listen to me. You're gonna be
fine. You're gonna be fine. Marla?

1189
01:52:10,516 --> 01:52:12,726
Help. Help!

1190
01:52:13,352 --> 01:52:14,937
Marla.

1191
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,442
No, Marla!

1192
01:52:25,531 --> 01:52:27,283
No, no, no, no, no.

1193
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:33,164
- So, with all the success...
- Help!

1194
01:52:33,247 --> 01:52:35,749
...are you still ambitious?

1195
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,793
Are there dreams
you still wanna achieve?

1196
01:52:39,503 --> 01:52:42,715
Peter, I am only
just getting started.

1197
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:46,886
Marla Grayson, CEO and
founder of Grayson Guardianships,

1198
01:52:46,969 --> 01:52:48,137
thank you.

1199
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:50,723
Thanks. It's been fun.

1200
