00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:21,805
The Innocents.

4
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,974
Henriette, have you
brought my tools?

5
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,974
What did you say?
- Did you bring my tools?

6
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,649
No.

7
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:52,374
I think it's in the car.

8
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:12,999
You know how Anna is.
She can't stand new things.

9
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:19,166
Dad can stay with Anna anyway.
Then we can go on holiday.

10
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,208
I can buy magazines
at the airport.

11
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:30,083
Dad can't take a vacation at the
moment because of his new job.

12
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:34,166
And I have a lot of work here.
Come on, it's gonna be fun.

13
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:38,083
You will make new
friends at school.

14
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,099
It's nice to have
new friends, isn't it?

15
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:43,641
But everyone is on vacation.
- No.

16
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:48,458
Not everyone.
Now you must sleep. Good night.

17
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,166
I do not want to sleep.

18
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,916
Okay then. Fine.
You can stay awake.

19
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,499
Won't you stay
with me for a while?

20
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:05,208
No, but I can leave
the door open.

21
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:09,291
So, now I can hear you.
Good night.

22
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,291
Hi.

23
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:39,624
Are you new here?
- Yes.

24
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,541
Can I show you something?

25
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,066
What?

26
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:02,874
Where I used to live, I
had built a tree house.

27
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:05,958
I also had a slingshot,

28
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:11,916
with which I shot
'all of my enemies'.

29
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,749
Did you move?
- Yes very often.

30
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:19,624
Hold on and stand there.

31
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,124
Okay.

32
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:28,374
Should I throw it?
- No, just drop it.

33
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,458
Are you ready?
- Yes.

34
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,524
Now.

35
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:44,083
We need to find
something lighter.

36
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,249
Ready?
- Yes.

37
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,358
Now.

38
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:05,999
How do you do that?

39
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:09,291
I have practiced a lot.
- Again.

40
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,124
Ready?

41
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,816
Now.

42
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:27,208
Can I try?
- Yes.

43
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,874
Concentrate well, okay?

44
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,608
Now.

45
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,733
It did not work.

46
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,441
See what I can.

47
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,983
That's just scary.

48
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,583
Can you move these?
- No.

49
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,616
I do.

50
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,098
It flew sideways.

51
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:15,333
Does he use a slingshot?

52
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,858
No. He made it move by himself.

53
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,999
Be careful with slingshots.

54
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,574
Can he do magic?
- Yes.

55
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,324
Cool.
- What is that?

56
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,449
There was also football.

57
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:42,208
Well done. Put it down.

58
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,166
I was not allowed
to participate.

59
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:46,326
The teams must
have been complete.

60
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:49,924
I'll do it.

61
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:18,499
Maybe you can help me?

62
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:22,525
I'll take that pillow.
Oh my ass.

63
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,366
A chair.

64
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,424
Look. A chair.

65
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:17,024
Come here then.

66
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,258
This way.

67
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:30,624
Dad is waiting for us.
We have to go. Always so busy.

68
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,999
Yes, you have.

69
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:47,616
My hair is a little thicker
than yours, I think.

70
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:53,124
And my hair is much
darker than yours.

71
00:12:56,291 --> 00:13:02,541
Look at the difference in color.

72
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:07,274
I am a lot darker than you.
Like this.

73
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,833
I expressed myself badly.

74
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,941
No one has more beautiful
hair than anyone else.

75
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:22,841
Sorry.
Sit still or I can't brush your hair.

76
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,641
Mama?

77
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:26,066
I myself have worked
as a registered nurse.

78
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:31,737
So I notice changes quickly.

79
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:36,066
Doesn't she say anything?
No expressive language?

80
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:41,966
No, she just makes some noises.

81
00:14:42,091 --> 00:14:44,624
She used to speak.

82
00:14:47,483 --> 00:14:52,166
Wasn't her diagnosis at the age of four?
- Yes, but it started before that.

83
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:57,958
She talked a lot and then
gradually she lost her ability to speak.

84
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:01,733
Wasn't that to get attention?

85
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:08,191
No, as a three-year-old she
talked through everything.

86
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:11,624
Can I show you around, Anna?

87
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:16,124
Do you like to play?

88
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:28,541
Hey, that's a lot of blood!

89
00:15:29,758 --> 00:15:32,041
Come... Sit down.

90
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,208
Anna? What happened?

91
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,516
But that's glass.

92
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,291
Susu.

93
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,208
Susu?

94
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,741
Would you like to go for a walk with Anna?
- No.

95
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:47,183
On the playground in front of the door.
- No, I don't feel like it.

96
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,291
Good night.
- Good night.

97
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,791
Mom? -Yes?

98
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:28,691
When I pray, may I
do so in my own words?

99
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,774
Yes, you can pray
in your own words.

100
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,516
Maybe you can
pray for daddy too?

101
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:37,316
Can I just lie down and listen?

102
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,074
What do you mean?
- Just listen?

103
00:18:42,499 --> 00:18:45,899
Yes.
But that is not the same as praying.

104
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,233
I think so.
- Okay.

105
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:53,824
But good night. Go to sleep now.
- Good night.

106
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:21,666
We go to many places.
We also go to the city.

107
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:24,999
With my friends and
their little brother.

108
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:39,541
You can't say that.

109
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,541
That is very badly done.

110
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,624
I have to tell.

111
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,674
Is that your sister?

112
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:59,283
She is autistic.

113
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:09,616
Stop.

114
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,483
Look.

115
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,841
She can see?
- Yes.

116
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,924
She's just a little weird.

117
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:36,806
Did you squeeze hard?
- Yes.

118
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,083
Should we go play?

119
00:21:53,316 --> 00:21:55,274
Will you sit here for a while?

120
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,091
We're going for a walk.

121
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:03,041
That way she can sit
for a very long time.

122
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,916
Hey. What are you doing?

123
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,883
Do you want the ball?

124
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:33,566
Do you want it?

125
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:54,416
Hi.

126
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:29,566
Is that your cat?
- No, he arrived yesterday.

127
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,008
Psst, Jabba.

128
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:37,874
I just call him Jabba.

129
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,041
Hey, Jabba.

130
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,383
Even higher?
- Yes.

131
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:30,974
Is he dead?

132
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,624
Should we finish him?
- What do you mean?

133
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:06,366
Do not.

134
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:11,083
Did you hear that?

135
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,924
He's hot.

136
00:26:24,841 --> 00:26:28,399
Where are you going?
- I have to go home.

137
00:26:56,041 --> 00:27:00,266
Anna, come on, we have to go.
Anna, come.

138
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:02,449
She wants to stay.

139
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:06,958
Yes, but we have to go. Come.

140
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,716
Do you want me to come?

141
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:35,866
Can you take her tomorrow?

142
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,249
I don't know yet.

143
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,041
Come.
- She wants that.

144
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,583
I can ask.

145
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,791
Can I take Anna with me today?

146
00:28:06,316 --> 00:28:08,624
Do you want that?

147
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,833
Would you like that?

148
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:18,199
Can we go?

149
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:23,616
Yes, if you stay
on the playground.

150
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,616
Is your phone charged?

151
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,849
Yes.

152
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:41,283
How many?

153
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,616
Five?

154
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:51,941
A castle.

155
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,974
Two.

156
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:58,583
Three. Four.

157
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,974
We have to go.

158
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:21,258
It was you?
- No she.

159
00:32:02,858 --> 00:32:04,933
That's not going to work.

160
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:09,599
It's way too big.
- We're trying. Stand there.

161
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:14,116
Stand together.
It works better together.

162
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:18,733
Are you ready?

163
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:29,187
Anna couldn't do it alone.
She can with you.

164
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:31,583
Hi, what are you doing?

165
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:43,874
Can you do that too?
- No.

166
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:46,291
So just her and me?
- But...

167
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:49,374
you can hear Anna, right?
- Yes.

168
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:54,283
And she can hear me too.
- Do you hear me?

169
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,391
No, but him a little.

170
00:33:00,874 --> 00:33:02,274
What do you hear?

171
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:12,733
Just something.
But with her I feel it all the time.

172
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,974
We think the same.
We think together.

173
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,024
Are you ready?
- Yes.

174
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,374
Banana.

175
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,964
Banana?
- Correct.

176
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,241
Did you hear that?
- No.

177
00:33:33,666 --> 00:33:37,624
Can you do the same with Anna?
- I can try it.

178
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,974
Ready?
- Yes.

179
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:04,366
No.

180
00:34:06,391 --> 00:34:07,799
Banana banana.

181
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:10,699
What does that mean?
- Two bananas.

182
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,183
Try again.
And you don't say anything, okay?

183
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:24,249
Ready?
- Yes.

184
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,762
Banana.
- Correct.

185
00:34:47,774 --> 00:34:51,208
I cheated. I used her.
It's easy with her.

186
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,974
I can't do anything.

187
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,325
You go all the way
up, then we go down?

188
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,858
Hi.

189
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,899
Okay, we're coming.

190
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:13,208
See you soon.

191
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:19,316
We forgot to eat.
We have to go home now.

192
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:22,108
Bye. -Bye.

193
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,083
How long were you gone. Was it fun?
- Yes of course.

194
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,666
What's the dessert?
- Ice cream.

195
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,258
Mama?

196
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:05,074
Shark.

197
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:20,541
Mom, can I watch TV?

198
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,558
That's bigger.

199
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:25,624
Who are you talking to?

200
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:32,124
To nobody.
I'm talking to someone who isn't here.

201
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:41,191
Answer.

202
00:38:43,149 --> 00:38:44,549
Hi.

203
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,616
Hi.

204
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:03,024
Benjamin, answer
me when I talk to you.

205
00:39:06,533 --> 00:39:08,558
Answer me!

206
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:14,708
Where are you doing?
What's this mess?

207
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:54,020
Aisha?

208
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,794
Aisha?

209
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,516
Hi?

210
00:41:13,291 --> 00:41:14,891
Is everything okay?

211
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:18,199
There was someone in the room.

212
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:22,791
No, that must have been the TV.
Come on, let's go to sleep.

213
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:26,403
I'll sit next to you
for a moment.

214
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,899
Sweetie.

215
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,583
Try to go even further.

216
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,558
Down.

217
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:20,358
Ben is a shit kid.

218
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,158
Ben is a shit kid.

219
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:42,958
You shouldn't laugh at someone.

220
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:46,224
She laughed at me.

221
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,083
No.

222
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:25,961
Are you sure?

223
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:34,399
No.

224
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:42,274
That hurts.

225
00:44:44,253 --> 00:44:45,911
Stop.

226
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:48,999
Go away.

227
00:44:55,424 --> 00:44:58,399
Go away.
- Bitch.

228
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:05,766
She doesn't feel anything.
- Yes.

229
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:10,691
Then why isn't she crying?
She never cries.

230
00:45:11,016 --> 00:45:13,033
She is crying inside.

231
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:27,399
Yes, you can.

232
00:45:29,183 --> 00:45:32,266
Just talk out loud like me.

233
00:45:34,391 --> 00:45:36,166
Yes, you can.

234
00:45:39,108 --> 00:45:41,808
You just have to
pronounce it, like me.

235
00:45:54,499 --> 00:45:56,033
No...

236
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:00,224
You can do it.

237
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,008
No...

238
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,041
Now you talk.

239
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:10,699
Now you're talking.

240
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,239
Hi.

241
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:21,999
Hi.

242
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:28,916
Does it hurt a lot?

243
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:31,124
It...

244
00:46:33,953 --> 00:46:35,811
It stings.

245
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:47,374
Mom? -Hey.

246
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,091
What happened?

247
00:46:56,716 --> 00:46:58,608
She fell.

248
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:02,091
Is everything alright?

249
00:47:06,117 --> 00:47:08,317
Come, I'll take off your shoes.

250
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:11,991
Oh my God.

251
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,891
That must hurt a lot.

252
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:20,799
What did you do?

253
00:47:21,124 --> 00:47:25,233
She fell while walking.
- On the playground?

254
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:33,916
Don't lie to me.
This is not due to a fall.

255
00:47:35,041 --> 00:47:37,466
What happened? Tell me.

256
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:43,374
I asked you something.
What happened?

257
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,991
Can I not trust you at all?

258
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:53,533
She's fine.
- Not true. She must be in a lot of pain.

259
00:47:55,999 --> 00:47:59,458
Come on, baby.
Mom will take care of you.

260
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:02,599
It'll be fine.

261
00:48:22,874 --> 00:48:24,516
Come in.

262
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:27,099
Hi.

263
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:35,274
Sorry I was so strict.

264
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:39,808
It's not your duty
to babysit Anna.

265
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:42,649
It's nice that you
want to do this.

266
00:48:44,474 --> 00:48:47,716
But that's a lot
of responsibility.

267
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:51,224
So it's my fault.

268
00:48:52,924 --> 00:48:56,799
What do you all do when
you are out for so long?

269
00:48:57,224 --> 00:49:01,683
Everything.
I don't always remember.

270
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,866
But what happened today?

271
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:13,824
You weren't on the playground, were you?
I won't get angry.

272
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:19,658
I know you wanted to babysit her.
I just want to know what happened.

273
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,066
Mama?

274
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:27,199
Anna is doing better.
- Oh yeah?

275
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:34,258
She's playing and she
can already say things.

276
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:40,033
She can talk.

277
00:49:42,033 --> 00:49:43,833
It's true.

278
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:48,066
You shouldn't joke about that.

279
00:49:48,191 --> 00:49:50,641
I'm not joking.
- Just stop it.

280
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:04,708
Say something.
- That's enough, Ida.

281
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:08,049
Who is that?
Can you tell who that is?

282
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:17,233
Mother. Mother.

283
00:50:35,466 --> 00:50:37,716
Come on, you were almost there.

284
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:40,566
Say it.
- Now stop.

285
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:45,316
Say it.
- Stop it, I said.

286
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:55,533
You get one more chance
to tell how Anna got hurt.

287
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,808
No?

288
00:51:01,774 --> 00:51:05,149
Then I can no longer
trust Anna to you.

289
00:51:05,374 --> 00:51:06,974
Understood?

290
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,099
I don't care.

291
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:52,583
Ouch. Damn.

292
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,733
You think this is funny?

293
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:02,869
Do you know how much it hurts?
What the hell is...

294
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:13,174
Aisha and I are doing well.

295
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:17,708
But I'm tired.
I work day and night.

296
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:21,441
Yes.

297
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:25,691
Mom? -What?

298
00:53:27,524 --> 00:53:29,283
You're bleeding.

299
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:33,099
You're bleeding.
- What?

300
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:35,966
You're bleeding here.

301
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:44,283
Stop.
- But you're bleeding from your forehead.

302
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:52,924
I'm not bleeding, Aisha.
Stop fooling around.

303
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:58,049
That's my daughter, Aisha.
Now I can hear you again.

304
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:13,733
I've heard about it.

305
00:57:24,016 --> 00:57:28,191
Benjamin.
You need to call someone...

306
00:57:29,474 --> 00:57:31,641
You have to call...

307
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:35,408
You have to call...

308
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,249
Hi.

309
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:34,358
Anna?

310
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:37,249
Anna?

311
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,591
We'll clean it up.

312
01:00:42,216 --> 01:00:45,758
We'll clean it up.
We are playing.

313
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:47,917
We are playing.

314
01:00:48,877 --> 01:00:53,744
We'll clean it up, Mom.
We will do that.

315
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:00,249
Everything is fine?

316
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:09,633
What is it?

317
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:18,208
Everything is fine.

318
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:23,324
What is this?

319
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,024
What is this?
What do they call that?

320
01:01:30,749 --> 01:01:33,641
What's this called? Tutu, tutu.

321
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:40,599
Give her some time.
She's a little tired.

322
01:01:41,224 --> 01:01:43,274
She doesn't like it.

323
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:46,291
What is this?

324
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:51,841
Can you tell what this is?
Where I drink from.

325
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:54,016
Glass.

326
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:56,758
Glass.

327
01:01:57,683 --> 01:01:59,566
Did you hear that?

328
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:04,033
Did you hear that? Who is this?

329
01:02:04,158 --> 01:02:05,883
Who is this?

330
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:11,183
Can you say that?
- Daddy.

331
01:02:14,158 --> 01:02:15,833
What did you say?

332
01:02:16,258 --> 01:02:17,658
Papa.

333
01:02:22,208 --> 01:02:25,324
You are so brave.
- Very good.

334
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,274
Poor boy.

335
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:25,624
That is absolutely terrible.
Poor parents.

336
01:06:31,316 --> 01:06:33,341
Do you think Ida knew him?

337
01:06:34,066 --> 01:06:39,399
Do you think they met?
- I don't think so. She is nine. He was...

338
01:06:40,724 --> 01:06:46,858
Yes, he was older.
14, isn't that far. So cruel.

339
01:06:48,291 --> 01:06:50,874
Aisha?
- Yes?

340
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:55,183
I want you to stay home today.
- Why?

341
01:06:56,008 --> 01:06:57,874
Because I say so.

342
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:02,491
Will you stay on the playground today?
- Yes.

343
01:07:04,216 --> 01:07:07,483
Have you ever been to
the pedestrian bridge?

344
01:07:09,241 --> 01:07:12,249
No, I haven't.
- Bye.

345
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:23,483
What is it?

346
01:08:40,008 --> 01:08:41,758
Everything's fine?

347
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:50,483
I can convince people.

348
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:54,024
What do you mean?

349
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,724
I can make people do things.

350
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:04,083
Like what?
- Things I want them to do.

351
01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:07,241
No way.

352
01:09:07,866 --> 01:09:10,266
I can do that.
- Then do it on me.

353
01:09:12,124 --> 01:09:13,533
No.

354
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:17,566
Yes. Come on.

355
01:09:18,191 --> 01:09:21,524
Or are you kidding?
- Okay.

356
01:09:25,866 --> 01:09:27,483
Do not look.

357
01:09:28,425 --> 01:09:29,825
Why not?

358
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,608
And promise not to laugh.

359
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:54,274
How did you do that?
- I don't know.

360
01:11:01,058 --> 01:11:02,808
This was a snake.

361
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,824
What?

362
01:11:05,449 --> 01:11:07,466
Wasn't you?

363
01:11:07,891 --> 01:11:10,241
No, that must have been you.

364
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:13,267
I wanted to put
you on the fridge.

365
01:11:14,908 --> 01:11:18,533
Are you afraid of snakes?
- Yes very much.

366
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:22,399
Keep upright.

367
01:11:24,933 --> 01:11:28,233
Like this?
- A little further from your face.

368
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:47,924
You would rather be that way.

369
01:11:48,049 --> 01:11:51,441
Look at that one.
If you look like this, what are you?

370
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:54,008
Pleased.
- Yeah, then you're happy.

371
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:58,008
Then you laugh
and clap your hands.

372
01:11:58,133 --> 01:12:02,599
You can laugh with your teeth or something.
There are those who do.

373
01:12:02,724 --> 01:12:05,358
Just smile.

374
01:12:17,874 --> 01:12:20,083
They run so fast.

375
01:12:22,258 --> 01:12:24,449
What are you going to do?

376
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,624
Just wait.

377
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:13,608
Aisha?

378
01:14:26,874 --> 01:14:29,699
Stop. What are you going to do?

379
01:14:30,824 --> 01:14:32,566
Mind your own business.

380
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,674
Oh my God.

381
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:14,874
You shouldn't just leave.
Where were you?

382
01:17:16,233 --> 01:17:18,049
Outside.
- Outside?

383
01:17:18,174 --> 01:17:21,108
Crazy kid, you can't go outside.

384
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:26,358
You can't go out alone.
Good that you found her.

385
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,241
What is it?

386
01:18:01,783 --> 01:18:03,658
We have to stop him.

387
01:18:03,783 --> 01:18:05,674
He wants to get us.

388
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:08,224
He wants to harm us.

389
01:18:11,045 --> 01:18:12,729
He does that through others.

390
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,658
But do you...

391
01:18:17,783 --> 01:18:19,766
What are you going to do?

392
01:18:19,891 --> 01:18:22,033
You are not allowed
to participate.

393
01:18:24,174 --> 01:18:26,074
We can handle that.

394
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:28,833
Together.

395
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:35,983
That boy who died

396
01:18:37,191 --> 01:18:39,508
that was because of Ben.

397
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,999
But you know that.

398
01:18:48,008 --> 01:18:51,102
Mom, can I take Anna with me?

399
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,149
What? No.

400
01:18:53,674 --> 01:18:55,758
I'll be careful. I promise.

401
01:18:56,183 --> 01:18:59,941
It's too late.
Can't you tell what time it is?

402
01:19:00,066 --> 01:19:01,908
Just a moment.
- I said no.

403
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:04,808
It's important.
- I will come tomorrow.

404
01:19:04,933 --> 01:19:08,841
Then we can play.
But now we're having dinner.

405
01:19:21,374 --> 01:19:24,091
Mom? -Yes?

406
01:19:24,316 --> 01:19:26,924
Can I sleep with you tonight?

407
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:31,591
Are you afraid?
- Yes.

408
01:19:32,416 --> 01:19:34,083
Okay, come on.

409
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:37,158
Sleep well.
- Good night.

410
01:19:44,524 --> 01:19:46,941
Mom? -Yes?

411
01:19:47,066 --> 01:19:50,766
Do you have to work tonight?
- No, not tonight.

412
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:56,008
When will you come to bed?
- I'll be here soon.

413
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:59,108
Now you must sleep. Okay?

414
01:20:03,491 --> 01:20:05,074
Mama?

415
01:20:09,774 --> 01:20:11,216
Mama?

416
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:16,433
Yes? - Can you get Boffa?

417
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:21,374
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

418
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:24,024
Okay, I'll see
if I can find him.

419
01:20:51,766 --> 01:20:53,383
Anna?

420
01:22:26,783 --> 01:22:28,283
Mama?

421
01:24:38,316 --> 01:24:39,908
Mama?

422
01:24:55,166 --> 01:24:56,666
Anna?

423
01:24:57,291 --> 01:24:59,749
Don't act like that.

424
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,541
Stop it, mom.

425
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,299
Mom? -Yes.

426
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:45,158
It'll be fine...

427
01:25:57,999 --> 01:26:02,333
I'm calling for my daughter.
She's bleeding a lot.

428
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:10,024
That's Odvar Solberg's Square 85.
Yeah, okay.

429
01:26:21,649 --> 01:26:24,983
Can I have a bandage?
- Yes, you'll get a bandage.

430
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:28,899
Aisha, they are
coming soon, please.

431
01:26:34,074 --> 01:26:38,591
Aisha, you have to stay awake.
Wake up.

432
01:27:43,366 --> 01:27:45,899
You knew her a
little bit, didn't you?

433
01:27:47,033 --> 01:27:48,474
Yes.

434
01:27:49,205 --> 01:27:52,430
Phew, that was terrible.

435
01:28:01,299 --> 01:28:06,341
But you or mom would never
do such a thing, would you?

436
01:28:06,766 --> 01:28:08,241
No.

437
01:28:09,266 --> 01:28:12,741
Ida, girl, of course not.

438
01:28:13,466 --> 01:28:15,433
You shouldn't think that.

439
01:28:16,608 --> 01:28:19,791
Of course we would
never harm you.

440
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:30,308
Her mom was sick.
Sick in her head.

441
01:28:30,633 --> 01:28:36,483
She was alone, very different from us.
We would never harm you.

442
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:39,608
You know that, right?
- Yes.

443
01:28:42,574 --> 01:28:44,233
Come on.

444
01:29:12,466 --> 01:29:14,733
Anna, are you coming?

445
01:29:24,824 --> 01:29:25,924
What...

446
01:29:30,791 --> 01:29:32,566
Let's go.

447
01:29:35,783 --> 01:29:40,458
Please. I can't do anything.

448
01:29:44,974 --> 01:29:46,858
Wake up.

449
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:50,511
He's going to get us.

450
01:29:50,836 --> 01:29:53,058
Please.

451
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,649
Sorry.

452
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:29,641
Good night.

453
01:30:29,766 --> 01:30:31,591
Mom? -Yes?

454
01:30:34,866 --> 01:30:37,824
What do you do
when someone is bad?

455
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:43,516
There's someone
being mean to you?

456
01:30:44,441 --> 01:30:46,108
No, there's not.

457
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:53,166
But what if someone is bad?
Or is going to do something bad?

458
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:58,366
Then you should tell an adult.

459
01:31:00,366 --> 01:31:02,891
And what if you are an adult?

460
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:08,916
Then you might have
to arrange that yourself.

461
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:13,308
Or tell the police
if it's really bad.

462
01:31:13,933 --> 01:31:17,249
Is there really no one
being mean to you?

463
01:31:17,474 --> 01:31:19,099
No, there's not.

464
01:31:28,574 --> 01:31:31,599
Sleep well then.
- You too.

465
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:19,083
I'm going outside for a while.

466
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:29,624
Mom? -Yes?

467
01:32:39,774 --> 01:32:41,441
Is everything alright?

468
01:32:44,533 --> 01:32:46,183
See you later.

469
01:32:47,108 --> 01:32:48,791
See you later...

470
01:33:01,783 --> 01:33:05,124
Who is there?
- It's Ida.

471
01:33:10,258 --> 01:33:12,683
Wait, I'm coming down.

472
01:33:34,191 --> 01:33:36,208
Do you want to do something?

473
01:33:36,933 --> 01:33:39,641
Where is your sister?

474
01:33:40,866 --> 01:33:44,991
She's home.
She's not doing so well.

475
01:33:51,158 --> 01:33:53,033
What have you got there?

476
01:34:20,233 --> 01:34:22,242
Come.
- Where are we going?

477
01:34:22,467 --> 01:34:24,301
It should be a little high.

478
01:34:28,733 --> 01:34:31,058
Do you want to throw?
- Okay.

479
01:34:43,608 --> 01:34:46,766
It'll break right away.

480
01:34:52,608 --> 01:34:54,108
Here.

481
01:34:56,583 --> 01:34:58,433
It's better here.

482
01:35:03,241 --> 01:35:06,558
Shit, it's going to hit a car.

483
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:13,024
Ready?
- Yes.

484
01:35:18,724 --> 01:35:22,358
Hey, get off of there.
Get off of there.

485
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:32,391
Hey, stop.

486
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,574
Hey you. Come back.

487
01:37:52,642 --> 01:37:56,458
Hey, it's mom.
You are in the hospital.

488
01:37:57,883 --> 01:38:00,649
Say, baby... are you okay?

489
01:38:04,866 --> 01:38:06,291
Yes.

490
01:38:07,216 --> 01:38:09,574
You have a concussion.

491
01:38:11,216 --> 01:38:15,858
So if you're feeling
confused, that's normal.

492
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:22,533
How's the other one?

493
01:38:25,166 --> 01:38:30,466
He's fine.
He got up and ran away.

494
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:36,299
Is he a friend of yours?

495
01:38:43,972 --> 01:38:45,697
Who is he?

496
01:38:49,699 --> 01:38:51,466
I don't know.

497
01:38:54,608 --> 01:38:59,333
That's strange, because
a witness claimed...

498
01:39:01,933 --> 01:39:04,791
that you pushed him on purpose.

499
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:08,699
What actually happened?

500
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:19,724
We were just playing.

501
01:39:26,908 --> 01:39:28,408
It'll be fine.

502
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:44,791
This way. Just give it to me.

503
01:39:49,674 --> 01:39:51,591
Is everything alright?
- Yes.

504
01:40:00,258 --> 01:40:02,824
People are coming
back from vacation.

505
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:21,124
What was that?

506
01:40:21,249 --> 01:40:22,916
Nothing.

507
01:41:56,041 --> 01:42:01,099
I forgot to buy something.
Can you babysit Anna?

508
01:42:01,924 --> 01:42:05,799
Yes that's OK.
- See you soon.

509
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,541
Hello, girls.

510
01:50:37,749 --> 01:50:43,624
There's an ambulance downstairs.
You can see him from the balcony.

511
01:50:44,874 --> 01:50:47,541
Did it go well?

512
01:50:48,066 --> 01:50:50,191
What happened to your cast?

513
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:56,716
Oh baby.

514
01:50:58,491 --> 01:51:00,266
Mama...

515
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:08,074
Calm down.

516
01:51:09,024 --> 01:51:11,133
Sweet baby.

516
01:51:12,305 --> 01:52:12,721
