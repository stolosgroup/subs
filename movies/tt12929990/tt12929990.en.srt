<i>Hey, New York, what's good?</i>

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,541
<i>It's your boy DJ Teddy P, and listen,</i>

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:17,833
<i>I'm hearin' some things.</i>

5
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:21,416
<i>I'm hearin' that there might be
a super-exclusive listening party</i>

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,333
<i>for the new Cre album tonight.</i>

7
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:27,041
<i>Now, I don't know when or where it is,
but if it's Cre, you know it'll be hot.</i>

8
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,333
<i>So if his people don't call me soon
with the invite,</i>

9
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:32,041
<i>I might have to leak this track
that just got sent to me.</i>

10
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,666
<i>You already know what time it is.</i>

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,375
<i>Yo, Cre! Hit me up! Ha-ha!</i>

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,583
<i>Yes!</i>

13
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,708
<i>Fabulous!</i>

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,750
Okay, these two pair of lashes
are weighing down my lids.

15
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:45,541
Shh. Okay. Now, tilt to the side.

16
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,375
- Okay.
<i>- </i>Yes.

17
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,041
- Now sultry, but with a holding.
- Okay.

18
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,916
Yes. Yes!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,958
- Okay, we're done. I got it.
- Okay. We good?

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,750
This is a perfect
last-Countdown-to-Epic-Music post.

21
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,250
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous.
My hands are shaking.

22
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,875
Erica, when has anyone ever not liked
a Cre album?

23
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:07,791
I know.

24
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,416
The man is a musical genius,

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,083
which is why he picked you
to sing on these tracks.

26
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:15,726
- After tonight's listening party...
- Yes.

27
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,708
...and the release of his album,
your life will never be the same.

28
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:21,250
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yes, and I cannot wait for you to hear it.

29
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,166
Because, girl...  ...I killed it.

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,875
Of course, you did! Now grab your purse.

31
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:27,666
Oh, wait. Oh, is that a snag?

32
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,000
Amber!

33
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,750
No!

34
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,541
You really don't have
anything else to wear.

35
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,958
I put everything in storage
when I came to crash with you.

36
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,916
Why isn't this in storage?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,375
- Just leave it.
- No.

38
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,375
No, seriously, come on, girl. Put it back.

39
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:51,958
- We can make this work.
- You're not cutting up my wedding dress.

40
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,166
Okay, you are never going to wear this.

41
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,416
And Jason is never coming back.

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,791
So, really, we're just making lemonade out
of relationship trauma lemons.

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
What's it gonna be?

- Thank you, girl.
- Yeah.

getting all the right people

00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,708
I'm tired of being ripped off!

64
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,708
Last time someone stole my work
and leaked one of my tracks online,

65
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:26,833
what did I say?

66
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:27,916
Huh?

67
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,958
This is my last album,

68
00:03:34,416 --> 00:03:37,458
but no one's ever gonna hear it

69
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,375
because this world doesn't deserve it!

70
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,625
You should... You should look away.

71
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,416
I mean, I really thought
my dreams were coming true.

72
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:07,000
But this...  ...this is not a dream.

73
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:10,208
No, this is...  ...this is a nightmare!

No.

75
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:16,125
He's gonna have to release the album.
The record label's gonna make him.

Because I was gonna get married last year

to that beautiful song...

91
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,166
...to a nice man, Jason.

92
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,208
But he left to Charleston,

93
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,791
and I didn't go with him.

94
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,041
You know, he was a banker.

95
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,250
And he used to make these rice bowls,

96
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,375
and I just never made it home on time
to eat them,

97
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,791
and then he called off the wedding.

98
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,208
And he took the rice maker.

99
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,583
I don't have any more rice.

100
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,041
Come on.

101
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,541
Look at me wearing my wedding dress.

102
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:42,083
And they were singing my wedding song.

103
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,166

00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,250

00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,583
Thank you.

Oh!

Wait, wait, wait.

119
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,666
Will you marry me?

120
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,291
Yes. Yes.

121
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,208
- Yes?
- Yes!

122
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,541
- You will?
- Yes!

123
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,958
Damn! Come on!

124
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,125
<i>Erica?</i>

125
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,083
Erica?

126
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,375
Erica?

127
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:07,583
That is not healthy.

128
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,541
What's the last time you went outside?

129
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,000
Outside costs money for one.

130
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:16,083
And B...

131
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:20,083
...red wine is full of antioxidants,
so it's practically like a smoothie.

132
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,333
Not really.

133
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,416
Or at least a green juice,
except it's purple.

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, look, I know it's been
a tough couple of months,

135
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,041
but that is all about to change

136
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:34,541
because you're going
to a tropical paradise!

137
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,708
Feast your eyes
on the Mer de Saphir Resort

138
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,375
on the truly,
stupidly gorgeous island of Mauritius.

139
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,500
I'm doing the social media for them,

140
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,458
and the point person mentioned
they were looking for entertainers.

141
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:51,791
So, I sent him your Instagram,
and he said, "When can she get here?"

142
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:54,625
Okay, where's Mauritius?

143
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:57,708
It's 700 miles east of Madagascar.

144
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,208
And look at the Jolly Rancher blue ocean.

145
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,375
Hmm, it's beautiful.

146
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,500
Mm-hmm.

147
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,833
And really, Amber, thank you so much
for always putting me on.

148
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,666
But this is one step up
from singing on a cruise ship.

149
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,041
What is that supposed to mean?

150
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,875
It means
I haven't been grinding my whole life,

151
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,791
chasing my dreams of making my own music,

152
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:21,166
so I can sing cover songs
in the hotel lobby.

153
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,083
It means I didn't lose a fiancé
to become a lounge singer.

154
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:27,684
It also means I didn't risk everything,
and I mean everything...

155
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,500
- Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
- What? Like to be a karaoke singer?

156
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,458
- Who am I?
- Okay. Okay.

157
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,375
I see you ramping up, but let me stop you.

158
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,875
You didn't lose a fiancé.

159
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,625
He lost you by moving to Charleston
for some boring VP job

160
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,458
in finance or whatever.

161
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,666
It's just seasonal.

162
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:47,250
Four months
and you are back here in New York.

163
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,208
- Mm-mm.
- I think you should consider this.

164
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,791
Because I'm worried
if you don't do something,

165
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,291
you may never shake this funk off of you.

166
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,375
Who do you see yourself as?

167
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,958
Someone who fuses into the couch,

168
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,625
or someone who's ready
to take another leap?

169
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,000
- Erica Wilson?
- Yes. Barrington?

170
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,958
At your service.

171
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,541
Welcome to Mauritius!

172
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,416
I was just getting some band stuff
before, uh, before I got you.

173
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,416
- Oh good.
- Yeah.

174
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,083
But, um, well, I'm in the band, your band.

175
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,166
- Oh?
- Yeah, yeah.

176
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,833
- Okay. Nice.
- Guitars.

177
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,708
- Cool.
- Uh, I'm also the, um, shuttle driver,

178
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:23,500
turtle wrangler, craft cocktail chemist.

179
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,583
- Yeah.
- Um, among other things.

180
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,666
Okay, uh, they're...

181
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,583
they're only expecting me
to sing here. Right?

182
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I pick up the extra jobs
'cause I'm saving to buy a house.

183
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,208
- Oh?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,208
I came here a few years ago and, um...

185
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:37,958
fell in love.

186
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,625
Wow, my gosh. Look at that.

187
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,875
I can see why. I mean, If you can wake up
to this every day forever, why not?

188
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,375
Yeah, the island's beautiful,
but I was talking about my girlfriend.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ooh.

190
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,625
Well, she's from here
and never wants to leave her home.

191
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,416
Oh, that's cool,

192
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,750
staying here for her.

193
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,208
Incoming.

194
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,208
Hello, Erica. I'm Claire.

195
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,625
I'm sure Barrington's brought you up
to speed with arrival procedures.

196
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:37,948
Why don't you follow me,
and I'll give you a little tour.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,250
She'll be in cabana 78.

198
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,750
Make sure her luggage
gets there, and Barrington,

199
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,916
remove your vehicle.

200
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,750
And don't be late for rehearsal.

201
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,041
As you know, we are a five-star resort,

202
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,375
and service adds brilliance
to those stars.

203
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,166
Are you prepared to be brilliant?

204
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,875
And here, we have the main pool.

205
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,916
Whoa! Wow!
It's so still and pristine.

206
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,833
I just wanna jump into it.

207
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,625
You like to disturb what is pristine?

208
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,416
Well, you can't.
The pool is off-limits to employees.

209
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,083
Well, then, where do we go swimming?

210
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,458
The beach. Oh, but not the beach
in front of the resort.

211
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,875
There's a public beach two miles up.

212
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,250
What is it?

213
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,916
Oh, it's just a gecko.
They're all over the island.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,416
They're harmless.
It's like a small dinosaur.

215
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,916
And Erica, please, no more screaming.
Only guests get to scream.

216
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,708
Hello, boys, meet Erica.

217
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,625
- Travis. Wayne, also in the band.
- Hi.

218
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,833
- And then, of course, you know Barrington.
- Yes.

219
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,083
Your sets are
from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. every night

220
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,833
and 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on weekends,
unless there's a wedding.

221
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,041
- Oh, who sings if there's a wedding?
- You do.

222
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:00,416
Wait, I mean,
no one told me I'd be singing at weddings.

223
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,708
If singing at a wedding is a problem
for you, I can organize flight options,

224
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,208
and you can make your own way back
to New York at your own expense.

225
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:21,000
Seriously? I'm supposed to take a leap
and move on from a failed singing career

226
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,333
and a failed engagement
to be a wedding singer?

227
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:25,750
What?

228
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,041
You knew.

229
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,500
It was hard to spin, so...

230
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:33,250
- It... Amber!
- Okay, but... but think of it this way.

231
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,291
You're facing your demons, which is good.

232
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,375
Oh yeah.
I am facing one right now.

233
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,666
Okay, okay, but how's the island?

234
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:49,916
I mean, well, it's beautiful,
and the air is wonderful,

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,541
and my sinuses are finally clear
after five years,

236
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,583
but I'm about to get on stage
and sing for people who are in love.

237
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,541
<i>Erica! Erica! Look into the camera.</i>

238
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:04,000
You cannot let what happened with Jason
ruin the rest of your life.

239
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:07,125
<i>And you certainly can't let him
ruin you on love.</i>

240
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:20,375
We'd like to invite Stephanie and David
to the dance floor

241
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,625
for their first dance as husband and wife.

I love this dress on you. It's so good.

260
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,458
Don't leave her.

261
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,041
People come here,
and they spend a lot of money

262
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,416
to have a happy, joyful experience.

263
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,625
So from now on,
your singing will be happy and joyful.

264
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,875
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

265
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:19,000
It's okay. It's okay.

266
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,708
We wouldn't be musicians
if we didn't feel things so deeply.

267
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,375
You'll get your sea legs back.

268
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:29,166
Barrington, I am...
I'm just not in a good place.

269
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,166
- I don't think I can do this.
- Sure, you can.

270
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,875
You just need the right song.

271
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,333

00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,958
- Hmm?
- Help! Somebody help! Help!

316
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,708
Help me, please! Help!

- Help me, please!

320
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,583
Oh, thank you!

321
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,708
Oh, thank you.

322
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
Wait, wait. My GoPro! My... My GoPro!

323
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,365
Okay.

324
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay, sir, you need to tell me
where it hurts, all right?

325
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,125
Ma'am, are you okay?

326
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,291
- Yeah.
- My camera. My beautiful camera.

327
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,500
My... my whole trip is lost, my memories...

328
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,583
I saw it on the swim out.

329
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:48,083
- You saved it!
- Okay. All right. All right. Okay.

330
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,750
Should we get a pic for the grid?

331
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,708
- What?
- No? Okay.

332
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,125
Hey, fam,
have you ever thought about the end?

333
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:58,041
I have.

334
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,101
I've had a life-changing experience.

335
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,458
Yeah, thanks.

336
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,416
Wow.

337
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,541
Hey, do you, um...

338
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,125
...know any restaurants around here?

339
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
'Cause I could use a bite.

340
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Um...

341
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,416
Yeah, and a drink too.

342
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,083
You know,
I read about this coconut water-rum thing.

343
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,000
How are you so calm?

344
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,791
That man almost drowned. I almost drowned.

345
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,333
I was just lucky I saw you
and could help out a bit.

346
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:34,541
You were so brave
just running out there with no training.

347
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,166
Yeah? Well, you ran out there, too.

348
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,125
Do you have any training?

349
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,666
US military, Special Forces.

350
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,041
Retired.

351
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,642
When you say it that way...

352
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,041
Okay. All right.

353
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,125
- Well, I guess that makes, uh, more sense.
- Caleb.

354
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,958
I... Erica.

355
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,041
Nice to meet you.

356
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,375
So, are you here on vacation alone?

357
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:02,375
Uh, not quite a vacation.
I'm here for my brother's wedding.

358
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:06,083
And I could finally make a family function
after a while. So, here I am.

359
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,000
Nice.

360
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,791
And you? I mean, what,
a fisher or amateur lifeguard?

361
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,958
No, I'm here singing at a resort.

362
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,041
- Oh?
- Yeah.

363
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,875
- A singer?
- Yes.

364
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:17,958
Wow, that's cool.

365
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,041
A spy. Well, that's cooler.

366
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:24,500
No, not a spy, just muscle for the spies.

367
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,625
Ah, okay. Well, spy security.

368
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,166
- Security for the spies. Yes.
- I like that.

369
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,250
Yes.

370
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
So, do you

371
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,791
wanna join me
for that coconut-rum drink thing?

372
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,958
Um, I actually have to...
I gotta get to work soon.

373
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:51,166
Oh, okay.
Um, well, I would love to check on you.

374
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:56,458
Gotta make sure that you're okay after
your underwater aquatic rescue mission.

375
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:02,833
You know, it's a really small island.

376
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:06,083
I'm sure we will bump into each other.

377
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:28,083
- Hey.
- Hey.

378
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,375
You're back early.
Isn't it your night off?

379
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:31,458
It is.

380
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,875
And it was a weird day,
but then I met someone I really liked.

381
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,791
And then I bailed on him.

382
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,791
Oh, Erica.

383
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,583
Oh, he was a tourist or a spy.
Uh, it's all good.

384
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:43,750
Oh, a spy.

385
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,833
No. Either way,

386
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:48,000
I probably would've never heard
from him again. Yeah.

387
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,625
Wha...

388
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:56,291
<i>♪ Sky could be blue as can be ♪</i>

389
00:23:57,041 --> 00:24:01,541
<i>♪ Grass could be green, green, too ♪</i>

390
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,541
<i>♪ My love the same as them ♪</i>

391
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:09,541
<i>♪ They're facts, it's true, it's true ♪</i>

392
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:15,333
<i>♪ Sky could be blue as can be</i>...<i> ♪</i>

393
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:17,500
I guess it really is a small island.

394
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:22,291
How did you find me?

395
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,166
Uh, I didn't.

396
00:24:25,208 --> 00:24:26,458
My brother's wedding is here.

397
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,791
Of course.

398
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,666
I mean, not just... you're not just
running around looking for me.

399
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,958
Actually, I was gonna call
every hotel in town

400
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,083
asking if they had a singer named Erica.

401
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,291
No, you weren't.

402
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,750
I would have found you.

403
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,458
Oh, and right there
is the happy couple now.

404
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,250
Oh, wow, you are very strong.

405
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,583
Wait, you're Caleb King?

406
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,041
What? How do you...

407
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:02,625
Jason mentioned his military brother
for years, but we never met.

408
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,000
You're <i>that</i> Erica?

409
00:25:07,666 --> 00:25:08,500
Jason's Erica?

410
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:09,708
Not anymore.

411
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,750
Yo, Caleb! We're taking the tour?

412
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,583
Ooh, you can bring your little friend
if you want... Oh my God.

413
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,791
What... What are you doing?
She can't be here. What...

414
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,625
- Hello Christian.
- She works here.

415
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,791
- No.
- Yes.

416
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,541
- No.
- Yes.

417
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,791
- Yeah. I work here.
- Yeah.

418
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,625
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

419
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,041
And the gift bags are stored where?

420
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,958
The gift bags are stored
in a staging area...

421
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,500
Baby, they have it handled. It's true.

422
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:36,875
Oh, and here comes my sister.

423
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:39,833
...down-home southern lady.
So when I say 100% of the packaging

424
00:25:39,916 --> 00:25:43,208
needs to be re-plantable seedlings,
I mean it.

425
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,791
All right, bye.
Okay, what's the next leg of the tour?

426
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,835
- We are waiting on the rest of your party.
- Oh, they're right over there.

427
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:51,833
With...

428
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:54,541
Erica?

429
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:58,291
Yes. Erica.
She will be singing at your wedding.

430
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,291
Oh my God.

431
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,125
- Baby, you're leaking papaya.
- Oh.

432
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:04,267
Wait, how do...
how do you know the wedding singer?

433
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:05,333
We, uh...

434
00:26:05,916 --> 00:26:07,375
We know Erica from New York.

435
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,333
What?

436
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:10,500
- Wait, what a small world.
- No way.

437
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:12,583
- Look at you.
- Come on.

438
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,541
Erica!

439
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,166
What a surprise.

440
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:19,041
Please don't say anything.

441
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:23,833
Hey, so, what are you doing here,
so far away from where you normally are?

442
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,541
I... I'm here singing. Um...

443
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,583
I think what brings you here
is way more interesting.

444
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,166
- Uh, well, Erica, this is...
- Yes, this is...

445
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,375
- I'm Beverly, Jason's fiancée.
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:26:38,458 --> 00:26:40,166
- Erica.
- Nice to meet you.

447
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,833
- Uh...
- She and Jason...

448
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:44,226
- Yeah, we... this, uh...
- You know each other from New York?

449
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,090
- Right.
- Yeah. I see you know Christian, too.

450
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,208
Hmm.

451
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,916
We all used to live in the same building.

452
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,375
- Yes! We got to know each other from, uh...
- ...when it was the club.

453
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,250
- Yeah. Yeah.
- A club?

454
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,517
- Yeah, it was a...
- Right, it wasn't really a dance club.

455
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,958
No. It was... It was...
It was a... It was a book club.

456
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,476
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

457
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,791
What luck running into Erica.

458
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:08,375
You don't often find employees
in the lobby unless they are working.

459
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:09,875
It's such a treat that you're here.

460
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,934
I never get to meet Jason's friends,
'cause you guys are all up in New York.

461
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,791
And we've been so swamped.
Can't get out of Charleston...

462
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,666
Oh, right. You moved to Charleston.

463
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,668
I was the first person he met
when he moved there,

464
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,250
right across the hall from me.

465
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:25,666
Wow, first person, huh?

466
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,166
Wasn't that, like, a year ago?

467
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,250
But didn't give you a lot of time
to plan a wedding, huh?

468
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:33,666
- Ha!
- No, he didn't. But I... I don't need it.

469
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,934
We just wanted it to be really intimate.
So, for me, that's me, my sister Janelle,

470
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,416
and, uh, Jason's parents are coming,
a few of our friends,

471
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,375
but that's it. That's all we needed.

472
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,166
That is so sweet.

473
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,166
Hey, um, why don't you take, uh, Janelle
to the spa,

474
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,166
and I'll come meet you
for cell regeneration time.

475
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,750
Thank you.

476
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,500
Okay, okay, yes,
it was so good to meet you.

477
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,183
Come on, Janelle, wanna show me
your secret plans for the weekend?

478
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,625
- Okay, bye. Okay, bye.
- Bye.

479
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,125
How could you?

480
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,083
I can't believe you're getting married.

481
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,458
I can't believe you're here!

482
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,500
What are you even...
What are you doing here?

483
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:11,166
Amber does social media for this resort.

484
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,291
They needed a singer.

485
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,833
No wonder I kept gettin' ads
about this place.

486
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,208
Wait. What happened with Cre
and the album?

487
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:19,458
Cre scrapped it.

488
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:23,208
Someone leaked one of the tracks,
and he just destroyed the whole thing,

489
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:24,541
along with my career.

490
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:27,583
Yeah, I'm sorry.

491
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,750
I didn't know.

492
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,416
Yeah, me too.

493
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:37,000
But if Beverly finds out we were engaged,
it'll cause so many problems.

494
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,833
- So please just...
- Wait, she doesn't know?

495
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:43,333
I could...
I could never seem to find the right time.

496
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:46,291
You know, I guess it's never really
a good time to tell your new fiancée

497
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,291
how you walked out on your old fiancée
a month before the wedding.

498
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:51,208
Wait a minute.
I didn't walk out on you, okay?

499
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,583
You walked out every single day
to the studio.

500
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,458
And you know what? By the time
the job offer came up in Charleston,

501
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,421
there wasn't a relationship
to even walk out on.

502
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,333
What? So you leave without talking to me,
and I'm the bad guy?

503
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:04,083
Listen, you were never there to...

504
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,541
- You know what? Rehashing this...
- Rehash?

505
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:10,291
Oh no. You know...
You know what? It was never hashed.

506
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,625
You were just gone.

507
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,000
Okay.

508
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,833
I did not do 48 hours
of therapy for this, okay?

509
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,125
Hmm.

510
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,708
- We're here for a few days.
- Mm-hmm.

511
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,458
We can avoid each other. Easy.

512
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,791
Yeah, mm-hmm. Don't expect me to sing
at your wedding.

513
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,291
Good. I don't. Tell 'em you're sick
or something. Call in.

514
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,750
- I will gladly do that.
- Well, good!

515
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,541
- But you won't tell Beverly, right?
- Go, go, go, go!

516
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,708
Morning.

517
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,250
Hi.

518
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,333
Did you just hear that?

519
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:46,666
There's an echo in here,
so, uh, I heard it.

520
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,375
Twice.

521
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,500
I guess you know now why I hate weddings.

522
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,708
Erica, why didn't you just tell us?

523
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,750
I didn't want to relive it.

524
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:12,750
- Does she really work here?
- Dude, Amber does...

525
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:14,875
It's not funny, man!

526
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,041
- What are you gonna tell Beverly?
- Nothin'.

527
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,541
Beverly finds out I was engaged
to Erica, she will lose it.

528
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:23,500
Okay, then, you gotta come clean.
Look, if you get caught lyin'...

529
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,125
Okay, listen, I know you mean well,

530
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,768
but I don't need the Honor-Duty
Captain America speech right now.

531
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,750
- Wow, Captain America?
- Okay?

532
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:32,375
Wasn't Special Forces.

533
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,500
Ooh.

534
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,583
All I'm sayin'

535
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,833
is perfect honesty isn't always possible
in 24-7 civilian life.

536
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,041
Hmm, yep.

537
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,416
And no one is expecting you to be perfect,

538
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,291
just honest.

539
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,208
And sometimes, keeping things to yourself
is the best way to go.

540
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:54,958
Otherwise,
I'll end up with two ex-fiancées.

541
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:58,958
<i>I wonder if I should try
for a wedding commission from the hotel</i>

542
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:00,708
<i>since they found it through me.</i>

543
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,875
- Amber!
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

544
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,875
<i>This is not about business.</i>

545
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:08,083
Look, I'll... I'll conveniently come down
with a cold the day of his wedding.

546
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,541
In the meantime,
we'll just avoid each other.

547
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,333
What? This is a good, sane plan.

548
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,000
Look, I gotta get ready for work.

549
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,916
It's a big resort. It can't be that hard.

550
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,291
Erica! Girl, hey!

551
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,916
Fancy runnin' into you.

552
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,666
Yes.

553
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,583
You know, it's... it's too bad.
I'm actually running late for, um...

554
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,083
The meeting about the music,
the wedding music?

555
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,000
Right. That's right now.

556
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,541
- Yes, right now.
- Yes, girl, come on. We'll go find Jason.

557
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:43,958
He's around here somewhere.
It is such serendipity that you're here.

558
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:46,000
Yeah. That's definitely a word for it.

559
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:49,416
I gotta tell you. I... I was so worried
Jason was missing his life in New York,

560
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,125
so to have you here is just...

561
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,500
Oh, wait, you should come hiking
with us tomorrow.

562
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:58,375
Oh no. You know, I'm...
I'm not much of a hiker. I... Bad arches.

563
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,041
Oh, no, girl, please. It'll be fun.

564
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,958
We usually discourage employees
from fraternizing with the guests.

565
00:32:04,041 --> 00:32:06,208
Resort rules. Right. Sorry.

566
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,000
But guest wishes always come first,
and I would hate to put two friends apart.

567
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,291
Yes, thank you!

568
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:14,583
- We... We're more like book club members.
- No. Thank you.

569
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,458
<i>Bonne journée, Erica.</i>

570
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:22,791
So, Beverly tells me you don't have
your wedding song yet? Really?

571
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,833
Perhaps I can make a suggestion.

572
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,041
- Oh please.
- Yeah?

573
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:31,625
Okay, great. How about
"Unbreak My Heart" by Toni Braxton.

574
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:35,500
- Uh, for a wedding?
- Mm. Mm-hmm. Yep.

575
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:39,875
Or, what about "Irreplaceable" by Beyoncé?

576
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,250
Uh, girl, that's a breakup song.

577
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,333
Mm.

578
00:32:44,375 --> 00:32:47,583
- I've always loved "Diamonds" by Rihanna.
- Yeah!

579
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,416
- Mm.
- Yeah, I like that.

580
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,291
Wait! Wait!
You know what will be a really good one?

581
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,083
"No One" by Alicia Keys.

582
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,458
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

583
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,291
Why?

584
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,916
Well, when you first moved in
across the hall from me,

585
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,875
you used to play that song on repeat,

586
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,208
and so loud.

587
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:10,208
I found myself humming it
before I met you, which...

588
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,208
I don't know, feels like a sign.

589
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,291
- Does it?
- Yeah.

590
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:17,208
'Cause, I kinda liked your first instinct,
Rihanna, "Diamonds," better.

591
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,125
Aw, baby, you do?

592
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,791
- Yeah.
- Mm.

593
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:26,375
So sweet. Oh...

594
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,875
Yeah. Oh!

595
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:32,166
So we're settled. We got our wedding song.
So, how many more of these we gotta pick?

596
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,708
Oh, do you mind if we, uh, pick the rest
on the hike tomorrow?

597
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:37,500
- Need to get some rest.
- Sure. Tomorrow's fine.

598
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:42,416
- Wait, what? What... What do you mean?
- Oh, I invited Erica to come hiking.

599
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
- You didn't?
- Yeah, I did.

600
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,458
Caleb.

601
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,416
- Good morning.
- Hi.

602
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,458
- It was quite a day yesterday, huh?
- Mm, don't know what you're talkin' about.

603
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,625
Did you tell Jason we met?

604
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:16,750
Yeah, I figured I would...

605
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,166
- No, I didn't.
- Ah, yes.

606
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:22,250
Okay.

607
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,166
Another thing to keep a secret. I got it.

608
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,375
Hey, would you wanna take a walk later?

609
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,166
I've got, uh, wedding stuff now.

610
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:35,750
- Breakfast and a hike, but...
- I know. I'm actually headed there.

611
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,583
Beverly invited me.

612
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,291
Wow.

613
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,791
You think that's a good idea?

614
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,166
No.

615
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,708
- Definitely not.
- Okay.

616
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,558
I can't believe you live here.

617
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:49,416
You must wake up every day
and pinch yourself.

618
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,625
I do. I do, but I'm still trying
to get used to the lizards, though.

619
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,875
- We don't have those in the city.
- Does proliferation have one "l" or two?

620
00:34:57,958 --> 00:34:58,958
Uh, one.

621
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:00,958
Do you miss New York at all?

622
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:04,375
You know, I thought I would,
but I don't mostly.

623
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:06,666
You know, there's nothing
to really go back to.

624
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,250
Yeah, I blew a good thing back there, so...

625
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,750
Too many memories.

626
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:14,333
Uh, no, you didn't.
Cre blew it by not releasing the album.

627
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:16,208
- Hmm.
- Jason told me about that.

628
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:17,291
It's just awful.

629
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:21,916
Oh yeah, I mean, there's that, too,
but I wasn't talking about my album.

630
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,833
- I was talking about my engagement.
- Hmm.

631
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,625
- You were engaged?
- Hmm, I was, but...

632
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:39,333
My fiancé got a really great job offer
in a small town,

633
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:43,000
and he wanted to settle down, have kids,

634
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:47,250
and I wasn't ready to walk away
from my dreams of becoming a singer.

635
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:50,291
A woman should never have to give up
on her dream for a man.

636
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,083
- And the right man won't make her.
- Mm.

637
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:56,416
Jason supports me
one hundred percent in my dreams.

638
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,125
Representing the great state
of South Carolina in the US Congress.

639
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,166
Ooh, okay, you're running for Congress.

640
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,416
Eventually. Right now, I work in policy
development for the city council.

641
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,416
Wow, that is amazing,

642
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,625
and with the support of your partner.

643
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,041
I am a lucky girl.

644
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:17,125
Yeah, I don't think he knew how important
my dreams were to me.

645
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,541
- Hmm.
- Or maybe he just didn't care.

646
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,583
Or maybe he thought your dreams were
way more important than he was.

647
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,000
If he was the love of her life,
he would have known.

648
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:27,958
Mm, that part.

649
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,125
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe. Maybe.

650
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,375
I don't know.

651
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,666
Wait. Do you still think
he's the love of your life?

652
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:46,285
- Morning!
- Ooh!

653
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,541
Who's ready for an adventure?

654
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,333
- I am. Y'all, let's go. Let's go.
- Yep. Okay.

655
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,125
- Oh, okay.
- That might be a bit warm.

656
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,184
Does it have any Wi-Fi there?

657
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,048
On the mountain?
Uh, probably not.

658
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:59,083
Beverly, you didn't tell me...

659
00:37:13,416 --> 00:37:15,750
Jason, look at this. Oh my gosh!

660
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,333
- It's even better than I thought.
- And we're here.

661
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:21,208
All right, you guys are gonna love
this rope bridge.

662
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:23,291
The views will make you just go, "Wow!"

663
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,500
All right? One hand
on the guide cables at all times.

664
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:28,333
Okie smokie?

665
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:30,056
- Okie smokie.
- Let's do it!

666
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,583
- Whoo!
- Okay, we got it. You first.

667
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,309
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.

668
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,166
You sure about this?

669
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,833
Caleb, this isn't summer camp, huh.
I'm a grown man.

670
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,250
All right.

671
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,958
- Whoo! Let's go.
- Yeah, let's do it.

672
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,541
You can go on and follow Beverly.

673
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,875
Nah, you... you go ahead.
I'll pull up the rear.

674
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:52,958
You know, just in case
a giant lizard comes for you.

675
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,875
I'd like to see that.

676
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,416
Guys ready?
All right, let's go.

677
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,541
Let's do it.

678
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,125
- You got this, Jay.
- Whoo!

679
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,458
Whoo!

680
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,458
That was fun.

681
00:39:17,541 --> 00:39:19,625
I can still feel the pendulum of gravity.

682
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:23,125
Mm. Mm. Mm.

683
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:27,041
- Hey.
- Hmm. What? I'm a little parched.

684
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,125
What? No. Look at Jason.

685
00:39:30,416 --> 00:39:32,000
- Camp Pulaski all over again.
- Oh.

686
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,416
What? No, he's fine.

687
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,875
- It's easy. He's enjoying the view.
- With his knees bucklin' like that?

688
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,625
Come on, don't look down.

689
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,125
Don't look down.

690
00:39:51,541 --> 00:39:52,791
Okay.

691
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:56,875
And he's frozen.

692
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,666
- I'll go get him.
- Oh.

693
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,875
I think someone's doin' that.

694
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,583
Jason.

695
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,708
It's Camp Pulaski again.

696
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:22,875
No, it's not.

697
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:26,791
Jason Xavior King, look at me.

698
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,083
You can do this.

699
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:33,750
I know you can.

700
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,583
Take my hand.

701
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,250
Just trust me.

702
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,750
Okay.

703
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:37,416
Baby!

704
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,583
- Baby, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good.

705
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,250
It was just a moment, baby.
It was just... I'm... I'm fine now.

706
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,083
Why didn't you say
you're afraid of heights?

707
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:48,208
Babe, I would have kept you
on solid ground. Oh, silly man.

708
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,958
Hey, it was just a little thing
I had when I was a kid.

709
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,666
Thought I was over it, but guess I'm not.

710
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,184
Yeah!

711
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,208
All right! Everybody ready?
We must toast to the gods.

712
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:04,375
<i>- Salud!
- Salud!</i>

713
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,458
<i>Salud!</i>

714
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,041
Jason! Are you feeling better, man?

715
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,916
I mean, that bridge had you rocked.

716
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
- Dude, I'm... I'm... I'm all right.
- He's always had trouble with heights.

717
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:17,083
Erica, you were so smooth
how you went back out on that bridge

718
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:19,000
to talk our boy back to land.

719
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,763
And you were so calm, too, before we knew
he was having a hard time.

720
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,750
- How'd you know?
- Well, I was just closer. That's all.

721
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,458
- Any of you guys would have done the same.
- Not me.

722
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:32,083
You have a knack for helping people,
like saving that guy at the beach.

723
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:35,458
- When was this?
- That's crazy.

724
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:37,958
Um, when I went
for that walk after I landed.

725
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,309
You have to come with me and Janelle
to my bachelorette night.

726
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,416
- Oh, yes!
- We need that light around us.

727
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,958
You gotta come. You gotta come.

728
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,458
♪ <i>You know you wanna do it ♪
♪ You know you wanna do it ♪</i>

729
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:50,708
Come on, please!

730
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,500
- Yes.
- Yes!

731
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,183
- Yeah!
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

732
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,000
Um, but first,
I need to get my booty to bed.

733
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,333
It's been a long day.

734
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,791
- I'll walk you back.
- Okay.

735
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:04,916
The gentleman.

736
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,333
So, what happened back there, huh?

737
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,935
Thought you were gonna keep
our first little meeting to yourself.

738
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:14,583
It slipped out.

739
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:18,875
Okay, so, you were in secret missions
in the Middle East,

740
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,875
but that just slipped out? All right.

741
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,458
Hey, look, why does it matter?

742
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:27,000
Earlier today, Beverly asked
if Jason is the love of your life.

743
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,958
- She asked if my nameless ex was...
- Well, do you?

744
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,083
What?

745
00:43:32,916 --> 00:43:35,791
Do you think
that Jason is the love of your life?

746
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,666
Because you're worried
if he knows that we met on a beach.

747
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:42,291
Why do you care?

748
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:45,958
Look, he's

749
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,291
my baby brother.

750
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,333
And we may not have been
on the best footing for a while now,

751
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:56,125
but I still want what's best for him.

752
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:02,416
Well, we were together
for four and a half years.

753
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,791
Those feelings don't just go away,
you know.

754
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:09,083
I don't.

755
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:15,166
But being in the military
wasn't ideal for long-term relationships.

756
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:20,208
I've never had that big type of love.

757
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:26,208
No international whirlwind love affairs?

758
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Affairs, yeah.

759
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,291
Yeah.

760
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Love...

761
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:37,083
no.

762
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:51,208
Did you really have to make a big deal
about that bridge thing?

763
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:52,625
Bro, you froze.

764
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:53,583
It happens.

765
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:55,809
I mean, I was
in the Coachella Ferris wheel once and...

766
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,416
Making me look like a wimp
in front of everybody.

767
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,208
There's my brother there to see it.

768
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,041
No one's thinkin' of you like that.

769
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,958
Now he's probably off
who knows where with Erica.

770
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:06,041
So what?

771
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:09,250
- So, what if I made a mistake?
- Hmm.

772
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,541
- What if I should have married her?
- You...

773
00:45:15,791 --> 00:45:17,125
You said, "Marry Erica?"

774
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,208
Bro...

I remember when you sang that song for me.

803
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,666
- What's going on, Jason?
- This is a lot, you know?

804
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,791
My parents are gonna be here tomorrow.
They haven't even met Beverly yet.

805
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:38,916
Wait, who meets their in-laws
at their wedding?

806
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,166
- Well, you know how my mom is.
- Okay.

807
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:45,875
You must really wanna marry her
to keep Naomi away until the wedding.

808
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:47,416
Mm-hmm.

809
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,000
Wish you did that for me.

810
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,583
- I should go back to the stage.
- Can we talk? Later?

811
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:06,208
I'm roped into a bachelorette party
tonight, remember?

812
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,208
See if you can get away.

813
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,375
I'll try.

814
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,541
Okay.

815
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,125
What am I doing?

816
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,166
<i>What are you doing?</i>

817
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:31,041
He said, and I quote,
"I thought I was over it, but I'm not."

818
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,708
<i>Yeah, about his fear of heights.</i>

819
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,250
Well, he...
he already called off one wedding.

820

<i>Girl. Yours.</i>

821
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,375
Okay, I gotta go. I'm meeting with Beverly
and her sister at the bar.

822
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:44,208
<i>Have you lost your damn mind?</i>

823
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,666
<i>I thought the plan was to avoid them.</i>

824
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,125
I tried.

So, Jason, this is all you wanna do?
Obviously, it's your bachelor party.

863
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,041
You know what?

864
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:52,416
Not really feelin' in a party mood
after that business yesterday.

865
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Mm.

866
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:54,958
What business?

867
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,458
Oh, no, no, no. Let's not go there.

868
00:50:56,541 --> 00:51:00,000
"What business?"
I have one little height-related episode...

869
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:01,166
And we're going there.

870
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:03,375
...and you go and you pick at it.

871
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:07,250
Jason, look,
you've always had this in your head.

872
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:10,583
I'm sorry for being born first.

873
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:14,583
You look down on me just because you're
so used to being the hero in everything.

874
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,791
Hey, hey, you know
I found a brother on 23andMe?

875
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:20,375
Look, but I am not sorry
for being good at what I like to do, man.

876
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,041
Leaving no space for me?

877
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,041
I couldn't even get past your shadow
in the chess club.

878
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,291
His name's Raymond.

879
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:31,750
It's not enough that you're this big,
bad military hero everybody can worship.

880
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:34,833
Okay, look, Jason, do you know
that Mom used to email me pictures

881
00:51:34,916 --> 00:51:36,833
of your cubicle up to your corner office?

882
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,125
She sends those to everybody.

883
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,166
She sends it to everybody
'cause she loves you. She's proud of you.

884
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,750
You are my brilliant, little brother, man.

885
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,000
And no one is judging you,

886
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:50,625
or comparing you to anyone.

887
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:53,625
Look, make your own choices
and stick by them.

888
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,666
That's what being a man is.

889
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:59,875
Okay. Don't lecture me about
what being a man is.

890
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:02,226
- I know you're not standing...
- I'm walking down the aisle.

891
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,916
- That's manly.
- No. Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Hey! Hey!

892
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,166
You're brothers!

893
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:08,750
We all want what's best for each other.

894
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,416
Let's not forget that.

895
00:52:11,458 --> 00:52:14,208
Nor should we forget

896
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:19,541
that I spent $6,000
on this 1974 single malt scotch.

897
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,500
- Okay, now, that's insane.
- Yeah, yeah, but we will drink it.

898
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,583
- We will absolutely drink it.
- Yes.

899
00:52:24,666 --> 00:52:27,958
Good, good. This cost a lot of money,
and I don't even like whiskey.

00:54:31,041 --> 00:54:32,083
Ooh!

927
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:37,125
Tequila shots for everybody!

928
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:38,958
- Especially you.
- Thank you.

929
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,041
Here you go.

930
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,291
One, two, three.

931
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,875
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

932
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,833
- You better come back.
- You better.

933
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,000
- Hey.
- Jason...

934
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:16,166
I was walking back to my room
and then your room,

935
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,208
and then I couldn't decide,
so I chose the ground.

936
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,166
Thanks.

937
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,458
Um...

938
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:32,166
Everything's happening
so fast, you know. Um...

939
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,833
And it's really...

940
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,041
It's really bringing up a lot for me.
You know?

941
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,041
Me too.

942
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:41,458
And, um...

943
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:47,250
you think I left
because I chose the job over you.

944
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:52,500
But in reality,
it's because I thought you didn't need me,

945
00:55:54,125 --> 00:55:55,583
not like you need your music.

946
00:55:56,833 --> 00:55:58,625
That's what got you through your day.

947
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,291
I didn't think I could compete with that.

948
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:06,958
Well, I'm...

949
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:11,041
I'm sorry
I made it feel like a competition.

950
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:18,000
And I'm sorry for hurting you, Erica.

951
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,041
Jason,

952
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,250
these last six weeks,
I have watched people get married,

953
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:28,291
and they all looked so happy.

954
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,750
The thought of having to watch you

955
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:34,833
get married to someone, and it's not me...

956
00:56:39,416 --> 00:56:42,541
Come here. Come here. Come here.
It's okay.

957
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:03,291
Oh my God!

958
00:57:05,916 --> 00:57:08,333
Erica! Erica, girl, where have you been?

959
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:10,291
Janelle had to step out
for a work emergency.

960
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,875
Get back up here 'cause I'm
singing "Shallow" next. Both parts!

961
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,166
Come on! Come on! Come on!

962
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,208
Where's my tiara?

963
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:26,708
Uh, you... you gifted it to the bartender
for her kindness and grace.

964
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,583
Oh, yeah.

965
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:31,000
You should probably drink
some more of your water, please.

966
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,833
Oh, I have another one back home
in Charleston.

967
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:36,583
You know I was Miss Charleston?

968
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:37,666
Mm.

969
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,125
Get out of town. Wow.

970
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:42,125
Oh my God.

971
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:44,666
- Oh my God.
- Mm.

972
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,166
I just thought of something.

973
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,375
I'm really gonna be a queen

974
00:57:49,458 --> 00:57:52,208
because I'm marrying a king.

975
00:57:52,291 --> 00:57:56,000
'Cause Jason's last name is... King.

976
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:59,125
Yep. I get it. I get it.

977
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,305
You're not gonna keep your last name, huh?

978
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:03,166
Uh, for my political career, of course.

979
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:06,041
But I think...
I think in my personal life, I'm...

980
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,333
I'm just gonna be Mrs. King.

981
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:12,791
Oh my God, I can't help it.
I am so traditional.

982
00:58:12,875 --> 00:58:15,500
I want the white picket fence.

983
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:16,875
I want two babies.

984
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,458
I want church on Sunday.

985
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,791
And I just love feeding people, you know.

986
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:25,666
My mom and dad used to have
these huge Sunday night dinners, right?

987
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,500
Every Sunday after church.

988
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:29,083
And then, when they were gone...

989
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:30,583
Um...

990
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,416
Anyway, I wanna do the same thing.

991
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:38,000
And...
And I have these two crock pots, right,

992
00:58:38,083 --> 00:58:40,625
and Jason has this one rice cooker
that he loves.

993
00:58:40,708 --> 00:58:42,208
And I... I can just

994
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,458
smell the home
I wanna make with him.

995
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:51,458
I can literally hear our kids just playing
on the swing on the wraparound porch.

996
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:54,875
I know that sounds so weird. I'm sorry.

997
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:58,625
No, no. Actually...
It's actually... It's really nice.

998
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:02,083
Here, I... I am so sorry
your fiancé broke up with you.

999
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:07,000
But you know what? Screw him.
He's lost the best thing he'll ever have.

1000
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:09,125
- I don't know about that.
- No,<i> I</i> do.

1001
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,958
You know, the men in our lives,
they <i>think</i> they're our everything.

1002
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:13,833
Although they are not.

1003
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:15,666
Amen to that.

1004
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:19,375
That actually needs to be official.
I think I wanna legislate that one day.

1005
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:22,333
I'm... I'm sure you will.

1006
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:24,833
- Okay.
- Okay.

1007
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:29,500
Oh shit! My name is Beverly Strattford,
and I approve this message. Okay?

1008
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,000
Right. Yes, girl.

1009
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:32,416
Oh, man.

1010
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:35,333
Ooh. Ooh.

1011
00:59:35,416 --> 00:59:38,291
- I'm gonna leave this here, just in case.
- Mm-hmm.

1012
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,583
- Okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1013
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:43,166
- All right. You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1014
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:44,750
Mm.

1015
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,375
Was that your phone or mine?

1016
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:52,166
- Mine.
- Oh...

1017
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,375
Who's texting you this late, Ms. Erica?

1018
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,375
Just one of the band
confirming rehearsal tomorrow.

1019
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:00,708
Oh, will I see you
at the rehearsal dinner tomorrow?

1020
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:01,791
Uh...

1021
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:03,083
I have to work.

1022
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:08,541
Well, then I will see you at the wedding!

1023
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:10,041
Okay.

1024
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:13,083
Oh, Erica.

1025
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:19,083
Girl, I'm so happy I met you.
I really feel like we're becoming friends.

1026
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,208
Good night.

1027
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,458
Oh...

1028
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:07,916
Hey.

1029
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

1030
01:01:11,375 --> 01:01:14,875
Uh, what are you...
What are you doing out here?

1031
01:01:16,875 --> 01:01:18,708
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

1032
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:24,041
Well, it is finally cool enough
to go for a run. So... here I am.

1033
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:33,083
I like to meditate
at this time of the night.

1034
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:35,458
Oh.

1035
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:38,416
How was the bachelor party?

1036
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,541
Well, we just smoked cigars,

1037
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:44,625
and sat by an infinity pool,

1038
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,416
and drank overpriced whiskey.

1039
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,666
How was your thing?

1040
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:50,291
Mine was...

1041
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,916
It was actually fun. I have to admit.

1042
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,625
Jason left us early.

1043
01:01:56,916 --> 01:02:00,958
Said he had to go work, but probably
just snuck off to be with Beverly.

1044
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:03,625
Hmm.

1045
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,500
So, do you wanna go meditate?

1046
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:15,666
Ah, let's... let's give it a try.

1047
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,416
Okay. After you.

1048
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:32,125
- No, I can't believe that. Okay, this one.
- Uh...

1049
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,500
Believe it or not...

1050
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:37,541
- The trombone.
- I knew you would say that.

1051
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,375
All right, how about this one?

1052
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,458
Yeah, that is the scar
that changed my entire life.

1053
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:47,416
- I blew it out on my last mission.
- Oh.

1054
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:51,208
And just like that,
the only life that I know... I...

1055
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,500
I knew,

1056
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:55,541
really is gone.

1057
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,500
Not many people
can see those types of scars.

1058
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:02,625
Hmm. True.

1059
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:08,041
I look at that scar and think to myself,
it has put me on a path,

1060
01:03:08,125 --> 01:03:10,041
and I don't know where it's gonna lead.

1061
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,125
Hmm.

1062
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,666
No one is coming to pick me up
to take me to my next mission.

1063
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:20,625
And I keep imagining my family and...

1064
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,208
...everyone...

1065
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:26,458
expecting me to know
what I'm gonna do next, but...

1066
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:28,666
I don't.

1067
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,208
And for the first time in my life, I have

1068
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,750
no plan.

1069
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:38,375
Maybe you should own that.

1070
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,541
Yeah. Don't worry about
what everybody expects of you.

1071
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:47,083
I don't know how to do that.

1072
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:49,708
Hmm.

1073
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:51,708
Neither do I.

1074
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:52,791
I guess.

1075
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:59,166
It's harder trying to get over
what you expect of yourself.

1076
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,333
Yeah, that's the one.

1077
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:06,083
'Cause I definitely expected
that album would be my big break.

1078
01:04:06,166 --> 01:04:08,208
Hmm.

1079
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:09,875
I'm sorry.

1080
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,166
I'm not sure that I am.

1081
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:20,166
But I do know
that the music is still with me.

1082
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,958
And though I have no plan...

1083
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,375
...I know I'm meant to sing.

1084
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,916
That's why God gave me this voice.

1085
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:36,458
Well, you can't argue with God.

1086
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,041
No.

1087
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:40,625
Especially not
when he makes a sunrise like that.

1088
01:04:45,333 --> 01:04:46,416
Wow.

1089
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,458
Okay, I...
...should go get some sleep

1090
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:50,875
before my parents get here.

1091
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:52,958
Seeing my mom
for the first time in a few years

1092
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:55,416
requires at least four hours.

1093
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Oh wow.

1094
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,958
- Um, I'm gonna go...
- Yeah.

1095
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:02,875
...hide.

1096
01:05:02,958 --> 01:05:04,208
See you later.

1097
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:07,083
- Before your mom sees me.
- Yeah.

1098
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:09,500
Then the sand's gonna hit the fan.

1099
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:11,375
- All right.
- Yeah.

1100
01:05:11,458 --> 01:05:12,708
- Good night!
- See you later.

1101
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:13,833
- Bye.
- Bye.

1102
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:29,875
Hmm.

1103
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:32,666
Mm-hmm.

1104
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:37,791
I've got to be real.

1105
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,291
Today's a very difficult day for me.

1106
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:42,541
I'm losing my baby.

1107
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,500
My blanket in the shade.

1108
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:45,958
Oh, Mom!

1109
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:49,583
I used to use his little body
as a shawl on picnics.

1110
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:52,083
Okay.

1111
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:54,083
And it's been cold without him.

1112
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,958
Attention! Attention. Attention, everyone!

1113
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,500
Oh God. Oh no.

1114
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,125
Attention, everyone!

1115
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:07,083
There's something I have to say.

1116
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:08,833
Okay.

1117
01:06:09,416 --> 01:06:10,625
I'm losing my baby...

1118
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,375
Come on, say it. Say it.

1119
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,833
...to a siren's call.

1120
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:17,541
- What?
- Oh, Jesus!

1121
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:19,416
And in times like these,

1122
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,583
I turn to Bette Midler
for the right words.

1123
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:22,541
Oh no!

1124
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,958
What does Bette Midler have
to do with anything?

1125
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,875
<i>♪ Did you ever know ♪</i>

1126
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,875
<i>♪ You're my hero? ♪</i>

1127
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:35,708
Ma.

1128
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:40,291
<i>♪ And everything I'd like to be ♪</i>

1129
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:41,666
Ma.

1130
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:45,208
<i>♪ Well I can fly higher ♪</i>

1131
01:06:45,291 --> 01:06:49,583
- <i>♪ Than an eagle ♪</i>
- Stop her!

1132
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:50,666
Mama?

1133
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,250
- <i>♪ With you as the wind beneath my wings ♪</i>
- Ma.

1134
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:00,625
Oh, is that a microphone?

1135
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:04,041
Oh my God, she's gonna ruin my wedding.
Jason, don't let her ruin my wedding!

1136
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,583
- Oh no!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1137
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:09,791
- ...for the people in the back.
- Mom, Mom. Hey, hey, hey... Um... Okay. Wow.

1138
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,976
She was just getting started, too.

1139
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,250
You've given these people
enough of your gift.

1140
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:19,000
Uh-uh. We cannot be stingy with our songs
of love and devotion, baby.

1141
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:21,666
I know, but it's my turn to toast Jason.

1142
01:07:22,416 --> 01:07:25,125
And I've really
been looking forward to it.

1143
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,958
Oh, oh, well, for you, baby.

1144
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,041
For you.

1145
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:34,458
Hello, everyone.

1146
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:36,250
I am Caleb King,

1147
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,166
Jason's older brother.

1148
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,458
Now, I don't...
I don't know much about relationships.

1149
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:47,041
I've never been married, but I know what
it's like to be committed wholeheartedly.

1150
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,708
And that is what you two
are about to do tomorrow.

1151
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,416
Commitment is

1152
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,625
an active breathing thing.

1153
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,458
Too many people walk away easily...

1154
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,125
give up easily.

1155
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:07,250
But the strength and love that it takes
to choose commitment,

1156
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,708
well, that...
that is something to look up to.

1157
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:12,583
And I do.

1158
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,250
So...

1159
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:22,625
...from everyone at this table,

1160
01:08:23,291 --> 01:08:26,458
congratulations, Beverly and Jason.

1161
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:28,041
Cheers!

1162
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,500
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

1163
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:56,083
You should really ask who's there
before you open the door.

1164
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:00,125
What are you doing here?

1165
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:02,958
It's over.

1166
01:09:03,041 --> 01:09:05,375
- Jason called off the wedding?
- What?

1167
01:09:05,958 --> 01:09:07,916
No. The rehearsal dinner.

1168
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,166
But...

1169
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:15,000
...I think he's having cold feet.

1170
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:18,958
So I figured I'd keep watch.

1171
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:23,708
In case he tries anything stupid.

1172
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,583
What do you mean by s... stupid?

1173
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,708
You have another one of those?

1174
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:35,875
Okay, "Wind Beneath My Wings"
is actually a good choice,

1175
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:40,083
but I would take Naomi for more
of a "I Will Always Love You."

1176
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,833
Yeah. That kinda mother-in-law.

1177
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,750
Just a little bit more menacing.

1178
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:45,708
Yeah, with a headscarf.

1179
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:49,333
Running off the plane like Whitney
at the end of <i>The Bodyguard.</i>

1180
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,833
- She has one of those headscarves, too.
- Yes, I bet.

1181
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,293
I bet you're glad you don't have
to deal with her?

1182
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,083
Maybe.

1183
01:10:00,125 --> 01:10:03,250
Or...
...maybe I would have grown to like her.

1184
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,791
You would have.

1185
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,875
I mean, look, she's

1186
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:08,791
crazy...

1187
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:12,958
...but all that drama
is just how she knows how to show love.

1188
01:10:13,458 --> 01:10:14,458
You know?

1189
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:19,666
Yeah. I guess things
could definitely be worse.

1190
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:20,666
Mm-hmm.

1191
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1192
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:25,333
You mind if I take these off?

1193
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:30,875
Oh, so you really are staying, aren't you?

1194
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:32,750
That is the plan.

1195
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:39,791
Hmm.

1196
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:42,791
You were expecting Jason, weren't you?

1197
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:49,625
I don't know.

1198
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:50,958
- Hmm.
- Maybe.

1199
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,333
You want me to leave?

1200
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:07,333
No, not really.

1201
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,750
You know what...

1202
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:18,958
always cheers me up?

1203
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:24,458
Okay, samurai movies
are what cheer you up?

1204
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:25,875
Yeah. Sure do.

1205
01:11:25,958 --> 01:11:27,583
All right. Okay.

1206
01:11:28,916 --> 01:11:31,708
All right. So there's one guy.
He pulls out a sword on another guy.

1207
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:35,083
And then they clash steel, and then what?

1208
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,583
What happens?

1209
01:11:37,666 --> 01:11:40,375
I mean, how does that guy know
he's slicing up the right guy?

1210
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:43,083
Well, see, they have a code of honor
that they live by.

1211
01:11:45,041 --> 01:11:47,708
- Well, okay, I wish life was that easy.
- Mm.

1212
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:49,916
Well...

1213
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,416
...it's not supposed to be.

1214
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:56,166
I mean, look,
the most interesting samurais,

1215
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,583
the ones you root for,

1216
01:11:58,708 --> 01:11:59,916
are complicated heroes.

1217
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:16,791
- Hey!
- Hey.

1218
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:19,083
- I thought you were in your sister's room.
- I was.

1219
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:22,166
- Wait. Where are you going?
- I was just gettin' some air.

1220
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,291
Okay. Um...

1221
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,875
- Can I...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1222
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:32,500
Baby, I'm sorry I didn't believe you
when you said your parents were a lot.

1223
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,000
And I'm so sorry
that I was so cranky at dinner.

1224
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:39,458
Um...

1225
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,876
I wanna marry you
more than anything in the world,

1226
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:45,708
but I can't lie.

1227
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,166
Baby, I'm nerv... I'm nervous.

1228
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,416
Hey. Hey.

1229
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:53,500
I'm nervous, too.

1230
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,708
- Really?
- Yeah, so nervous.

1231
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:06,958
Okay, I mean,
maybe we can just be nervous together.

1232
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,125
Deal.

1233
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,625
Oh.

1234
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,125
You asleep?

1235
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:38,416
I was.

1236
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:47,333
Thank you for staying.

1237
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:51,166
Of course.

1238
01:13:55,125 --> 01:13:58,000
- We should get some sleep.
- All right. Yep.

1239
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,833
Um...

1240
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,416
Um, I can take the couch.
You can have the bed.

1241
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,500
No. You...

1242
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,500
take your bed. I'll take the couch.

1243
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:09,833
Okay. Here.

1244
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,125
Ooh, yeah.

1245
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:04,500
Kidding!

1246
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,458
Oh, my goodness!

1247
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:10,458
I can't believe
you weren't going to say anything, though.

1248
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:11,708
Speechless!

1249
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:16,458
- Goodnight!
- Night.

1250
01:15:31,041 --> 01:15:33,041
Mm.

1251
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Coming!

1252
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:39,916
Erica, I need to talk to you.

1253
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,708
Jason, um,
this isn't exactly the right time. I...

1254
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,125
What are you doin' here?

1255
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:50,208
Look... Jason...

1256
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:53,666
- I knew somethin' was goin' on.
- What? No. We were...

1257
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:57,250
- We were just watching Netflix and fell...
- Oh, Netflix and chill.

1258
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,166
Now I feel real good about the situation.

1259
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:00,970
He doesn't even know
what that means, Jason.

1260
01:16:01,041 --> 01:16:03,875
I... I know what it means.
I know what it means.

1261
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:07,208
But it was... it was just Netflix,
all right? There was no chill.

1262
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:10,541
Jason, even if it was,
you're getting married today, remember?

1263
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:27,125
Erica, goin' after him isn't gonna
help either one of you right now.

1264
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:28,541
Erica?

1265
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:29,625
Erica?

1266
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:34,875
Erica, you should be
with someone who is sure

1267
01:16:35,666 --> 01:16:37,500
that you're the only choice for him.

1268
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:42,083
That man is not Jason.

1269
01:16:49,833 --> 01:16:50,833
Jason!

1270
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:58,625
Hey! Okay, you stop this right now.

1271
01:16:58,708 --> 01:17:01,375
This craziness stops right now.

1272
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:05,500
- We're not running through the sand.
- Oh, how... My brother? Really?

1273
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,666
Nothing happened.

1274
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:10,250
But are you... are you really jealous, or

1275
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,708
are you having cold feet, Jason?

1276
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,375
I don't know.

1277
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:17,791
I screwed everything up with you.

1278
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:20,541
What's gonna stop me
from screwin' everything up with her, too?

1279
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:26,541
We screwed things up for each other.

1280
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:30,041
Jason, the truth is,

1281
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,708
if you hadn't called off the wedding,

1282
01:17:34,291 --> 01:17:35,458
I probably would have.

1283
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,083
Then...

1284
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:42,708
Then what is all of this?

1285
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:46,958
Nostalgia.

1286
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,458
Coincidence. Guilt. Uh, I don't know.

1287
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,291
Maybe all of the above.

1288
01:17:54,666 --> 01:17:56,000
But if this was right...

1289
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:01,250
and you were the love of my life,
then it would not be this hard.

1290
01:18:11,416 --> 01:18:12,416
I love her.

1291
01:18:15,083 --> 01:18:17,083
I was on my over to tell you that.

1292
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:19,791
Then I saw Caleb,
and I just lost it. I just...

1293
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:22,267
Look at me. I'm gonna screw this up.
I'm gonna screw this up.

1294
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:25,375
- I know I'm gonna screw this up...
- No. Look. No. Listen. No, you're not!

1295
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,166
Beverly loves you.

1296
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:33,500
You love her.

1297
01:18:36,666 --> 01:18:38,500
Hmm.

1298
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:42,166
I feel like you're walkin' me across
another bridge.

1299
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,083
Well...

1300
01:18:45,791 --> 01:18:47,541
we got across the last one, right?

1301
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,041
Yeah.

1302
01:18:52,375 --> 01:18:53,750
- We did.
- Mm-hmm.

1303
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,333
Come on. Let's get you married.

1304
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,875
Yes, big sis.

1305
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:03,875
<i>Ma chérie. C'est trop bien.</i>

1306
01:19:03,958 --> 01:19:05,500
You look so beautiful!

1307
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:07,666
You like the sun behind you?

1308
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:09,583
Comfortable with those shadows?

1309
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,833
No, I love the shade.
These are just some candid shots. So...

1310
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:16,000
The photographers gonna come any minute.
Don't... Any second...

1311
01:19:16,083 --> 01:19:19,791
Maybe if she stands with
her better side forward.

1312
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:23,125
- Okay, careful now.
- Thank you, Ms. King.

1313
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:24,083
Thank you.

1314
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:27,208
- Wow. All right then.
- Is that Erica with Jason?

1315
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:31,000
Why on earth would my son
invite his ex to his wedding?

1316
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:32,541
His ex?

1317
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:35,541
Thank God he had the good sense
to call that off.

1318
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:38,875
But this staying friends
with your ex, ugh...

1319
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:39,958
When?

1320
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:42,791
When did he break up with her?

1321
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:46,125
- About a month before the wedding.
- Okay, "the wedding." Oh.

1322
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,333
Mm-hmm.

1323
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:50,625
- When were they engaged?
- Last year.

1324
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,375
Little hussy messed
with the wrong family.

1325
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:58,000
She's gonna curse the day she ever came
to the wedding.

1326
01:19:58,083 --> 01:19:59,875
You better call the ambulance.

1327
01:19:59,958 --> 01:20:03,125
Call the Mauritian police!

1328
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:11,583
Erica!

1329
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:13,541
Janelle?

1330
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:17,166
- You lying, scheming, two-faced...
- It's not what you think!

1331
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:19,208
I know where you live.

1332
01:20:21,375 --> 01:20:22,375
Where is she?

1333
01:20:33,083 --> 01:20:35,333
Erica! Erica, I need your help.

1334
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:38,500
Beverly's sister called all out of breath.
Beverly has canceled the wedding.

1335
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,583
Oh no!

1336
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:42,750
Yes, and she's run away.
Nobody can find her. It's terrible.

1337
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:45,541
Not for us. They still have to pay
for the wedding, but I feel bad.

1338
01:20:45,625 --> 01:20:48,208
She was breathing out a lot of emotion.

1339
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,666
If you can help,
I would be eternally grateful.

1340
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:53,083
Of course. Okay.
I'll... I'll... I'm on it. I'm on it.

1341
01:20:53,166 --> 01:20:56,458
The cabanas are the other way.
Have you forgotten your ground tutorial?

1342
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:57,583
<i>Oh, c'est impossible.</i>

1343
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:02,416
Yeah, you better run, Erica!

1344
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:12,958
- Oh, this is not a good time.
- Drive!

1345
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:16,500
Get out!

1346
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:18,666
See what I mean?

1347
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,666
You get out of this van right now!
I know that you and Jason were engaged.

1348
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,375
I know you've been lying to me
this whole time.

1349
01:21:25,458 --> 01:21:26,958
Make her get out of this van!

1350
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,625
- Wait. Let me fix this.
- How could you possibly fix this?

1351
01:21:32,708 --> 01:21:35,625
- Look, you deserve the truth. You do.
- The truth.

1352
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:39,000
But... But let me... let me share this truth
a little bit further down the road.

1353
01:21:39,083 --> 01:21:41,125
- What?
- Further down. Just keep driving.

1354
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:45,059
- Take me to the airport.
- There's been a misunderstanding.

1355
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:48,666
A mis... I saw the two of you
on the beach... Know what? Never mind.

1356
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,958
I will give you $200
if you throw her out of this van.

1357
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:53,458
Okay? Five, if it is still moving.

1358
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:55,875
Don't even think about it.

1359
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,758
If you don't throw her out of this van
right now, I'mma start swingin'.

1360
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:02,291
All right. All right.
Okay, this is not part of my job.

1361
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:05,250
Barrington.
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

1362
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,559
- I just...
- No. No, no, no, no.

1363
01:22:08,583 --> 01:22:10,083
Okay, I bruise easily.

1364
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:12,166
- Okay.
- No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

1365
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:14,392
- Barrington!
- No! Don't leave me here with her.

1366
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:17,083
- Come back! She's crazy!
- You cannot leave me here!

1367
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:18,791
- Barrington!
- Barrington!

1368
01:22:18,875 --> 01:22:20,833
You and Jason ought to be ashamed
of yourselves.

1369
01:22:20,916 --> 01:22:24,208
Beverly! Beverly, I swear,
nothing happened between us.

1370
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,833
Why should I believe you?

1371
01:22:25,916 --> 01:22:27,958
You've been lying to me this whole time.

1372
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,125
Okay, look...

1373
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,250
Okay, we have history,

1374
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,958
and we should have told you, but... but...
but we were... we were both afraid that...

1375
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:37,958
Well,<i> this</i> would happen!

1376
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,625
I feel like such an idiot.

1377
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,791
No, no. Please, please, look, look, look,
Jason and I are the idiots.

1378
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:48,083
- Maybe you do belong together, then.
- No, we don't.

1379
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,958
Because you're his perfect match.

1380
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,083
You know that dream that you have?

1381
01:22:54,875 --> 01:22:56,416
The both of you have?

1382
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,208
The... The porch swing.

1383
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,291
The children.

1384
01:22:59,833 --> 01:23:01,458
I... I got hives just listening.

1385
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:05,875
Well, why were you sneaking
behind my back, then?

1386
01:23:05,958 --> 01:23:07,875
Because we were blindsided.

1387
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:14,416
Truly, wh... what are the odds
of him showing up <i>here </i>to get married?

1388
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:18,541
Actually, they're pretty good considering

1389
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,083
Amber's really good at manipulating
social media algorithms,

1390
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:22,000
but... but still.

1391
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:24,708
I'm not some country
fried-green-tomato idiot, okay?

1392
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:25,916
No, of course, you're not.

1393
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,000
Well, the truth is...

1394
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:31,208
Beverly, I never got closure.

1395
01:23:33,125 --> 01:23:35,583
I was happy, and I was hustling,

1396
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,375
and all of a sudden, Jason was gone.

1397
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:42,583
And I was sad,

1398
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,750
but I was gonna be okay.

1399
01:23:46,291 --> 01:23:47,875
I was gonna make my music.

1400
01:23:49,208 --> 01:23:52,958
Because the love of my life
since I was a little girl was music.

1401
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:56,250
I still thought my dream was coming true.

1402
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:58,583
Mm-hmm.

1403
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:02,750
But that dream
was never getting married to Jason,

1404
01:24:02,833 --> 01:24:05,250
and that should have been my dream.

1405
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:06,541
It should have been it.

1406
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:09,250
It was my dream.

1407
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,958
Then why are you giving up so easily?

1408
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:20,875
Just the idea
that Jason wasn't sure about me,

1409
01:24:21,666 --> 01:24:23,125
even just for a moment,

1410
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:25,583
it hurts.

1411
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:32,083
I know, and I'm sorry.

1412
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:38,708
But Jason is so sure.

1413
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:42,458
And if you don't believe me,
just... just please, just go hear him out.

1414
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:47,541
Give him a chance to prove
that he is still the man of your dreams.

1415
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,583
I... I do believe you.

1416
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:00,541
I do.

1417
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:05,041
But come on, th... this isn't how
I envisioned my wedding day.

1418
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,625
Well, your wedding day isn't over.

1419
01:25:09,916 --> 01:25:13,583
Let's get you back there,
and you go marry the man that you love.

1420
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:20,666
You're coming with me.

1421
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:24,375
No. No.

1422
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,041
Yeah,

1423
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,583
because you need your closure.

1424
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,500
And I need someone to sing at my wedding.

1425
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:37,916
Okay.

1426
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:40,750
I would be honored.

1427
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:43,833
Come here.

1428
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:51,958
This hug is gonna have to wait.
I'm, uh, I'm gonna go get Barrington.

1429
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:56,281
- Everything's gonna be okay. Hang on.
- Erica!

1430
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,267
We'll... We'll get back to the resort...

1431
01:25:58,291 --> 01:25:59,291
Janelle, no!

1432
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,875
We are gathered here today
to witness the union

1433
01:26:09,958 --> 01:26:12,291
of Beverly Strattford and Jason King.

1434
01:26:12,791 --> 01:26:15,750
The bride and groom have chosen
to recite their own vows.

1435
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,375
Should be interesting.

1436
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:20,291
Jason.

1437
01:26:22,458 --> 01:26:23,458
Beverly,

1438
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,541
when people say, "I love you,"

1439
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:32,250
I think they focus on the "love" part,
and they don't recognize the "you" part.

1440
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,750
When I say "you,"

1441
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,333
I mean every moment of you.

1442
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:42,041
The you that hums when she stirs her tea.

1443
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:47,250
The you that gets so excited
by public policy.

1444
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:51,541
The you that makes me lunches every day
before I go to work.

1445
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:55,208
The one-day-mother-of-my-children you.

1446
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:58,833
And that smile,

1447
01:26:59,833 --> 01:27:04,833
that washed my heart with sun
the first day I met you,

1448
01:27:05,916 --> 01:27:09,291
I love and I appreciate that you.

1449
01:27:11,458 --> 01:27:15,500
And I am so thankful and so honored

1450
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:18,833
I get to love all of you,

1451
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:25,333
from now until eternity.

1452
01:27:26,833 --> 01:27:29,541
Beverly, I love you.

1453
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:35,333
Wow. Ooh...

1454
01:27:36,541 --> 01:27:37,541
This is...

1455
01:27:39,583 --> 01:27:41,208
Um, it was beautiful.

1456
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,958
Whoo. Beverly.

1457
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:52,083
Um...

1458
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,291
I had a poem that I wrote for you.

1459
01:27:57,166 --> 01:27:59,416
Um, and it has imagery and...

1460
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,583
Doesn't matter.

1461
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:02,666
Baby.

1462
01:28:09,541 --> 01:28:11,750
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1463
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,166
You are my dream.

1464
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,333
Sorry.

1465
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:21,125
And now, if there's anyone here
who knows why

1466
01:28:21,208 --> 01:28:24,125
these two should not
be joined together in holy matrimony...

1467
01:28:24,208 --> 01:28:26,708
Don't you even. Jason is not your husband.

1468
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:29,458
This man to the left
in the blue leisure suit,

1469
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:30,583
that's your husband.

1470
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:34,250
It's lapis.

1471
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:42,875
- Mom.
- I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1472
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,958
You may kiss, again.

1473
01:28:50,916 --> 01:28:53,583
- Yeah!
- That's my man.

1474
01:29:14,041 --> 01:29:16,708
- That went perfect!
- Come on!

1475
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:19,041
- Wow! Oh my God.
- Yeah.

1476
01:29:19,125 --> 01:29:21,250
- Okay.
- Classy for the ladies.

1477
01:29:21,333 --> 01:29:23,166
- Hey, I love you guys.
- Cheers.

1478
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:24,875
- Cheers!
- Love, prosperity...

1479
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,500
- All right. Cool, well...
- All that.

1480
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,500
You ain't even... Oh, my goodness. Okay.

1481
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:30,833
You got it on my leg.

1482
01:29:30,916 --> 01:29:33,541
I'm sorry.
I'm really excited. I'm really excited.

1483
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,916
You seem happy.

1484
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:41,875
You know, for a while there,
I doubted I'd ever be again,

1485
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,416
but look at me.

1486
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:46,750
I am.

1487
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:52,916
You know what? Hold that thought.

1488
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,500
Whoo.

1489
01:30:04,166 --> 01:30:05,000
Beverly.

1490
01:30:05,083 --> 01:30:06,083
Jason.

1491
01:30:09,458 --> 01:30:12,333
Now, I know you wanted
your wedding song to be "Diamonds,"

1492
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:15,250
and I know that's a beautiful song.

1493
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:19,500
But to me, it doesn't capture the love
that you have for each other,

1494
01:30:20,541 --> 01:30:23,708
and it doesn't express the love
that I have for the both of you

1495
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,500
as my friends, so here it goes.

1496
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:32,333
- What's she gonna do?
- Yeah...

1497
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:35,458
