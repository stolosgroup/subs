00:57:07,892 --> 00:57:09,825
or just before the bombing.

823
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:12,561
- Can you hear me?
Then pay attention.

824
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,931
Three years ago,
a UFO crashed in Chertanovo.

825
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:19,134
You claimed it was
an alien act of aggression.

826
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,603
That is a lie.
We attacked them.

827
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:24,640
And then I was treated
like a lab rat.

828
00:57:24,642 --> 00:57:26,642
My father personally
led the tests.

829
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,644
I demand that all
classified information

830
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,012
sealed by the Ministry
of Defense

831
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:31,547
be made public.

832
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:34,082
The military stole
alien technologies

833
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,819
and has used them to
secretly develop new weapons.

834
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:40,556
I know you think that
no one can stop you.

835
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,024
That is not true.

836
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:45,093
- Now what?

837
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,795
- She desperately needs
pure water.

838
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:47,797
Go and get some.

839
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:49,932
- Water?
- Yes.

840
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:51,533
Go to the store,
grab some bottles

841
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,001
and give money
to the cashier.

842
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:57,105
- Look,
I know how shopping works.

843
00:57:57,107 --> 00:57:58,874
You spent three years
away from society.

844
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:00,709
You may have lost
some skills.

845
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:04,646
- You go to the store.
- No. You go to the store.

846
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:07,483
- [Yulia] Can one of you go
or else I'll have to do it.

847
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:11,620
- You are the only one
not on the wanted list.

848
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,596
Got any cash?
- I have a job...

849
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:21,897
- [Yulia] Just go!

850
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:27,703
I thought you would understand
how dangerous it was.

851
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,288
To no avail.

852
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:30,872
Now I will do whatever
it takes to...

853
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,578
[Yulia] Is war the only
language you speak?

854
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,147
Excellent.
Then war it is.

855
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:41,116
Be ready
for more explosions.

856
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:43,685
This earth is no longer
solely yours.

857
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,853
- The question remains:

858
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,989
Why was the public
not told earlier

859
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:48,924
that the young woman
not only had contact

860
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:50,559
with the alien

861
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,193
but also received
an object from him.

862
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:54,263
Its purpose still remains
unknown.

863
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:55,597
- Where is the broadcast
coming from?

864
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,732
- From you. You're live.

865
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:58,901
- We're not on the air!
Mute the audio!

866
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:01,003
- What's wrong?
Who's on the air?

867
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:02,604
- ...Ministry of Defense.

868
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:04,740
No real progress
has been made...

869
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:05,974
- My, my!

870
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:09,278
- The broadcast center is being bypassed.
It's all over the Internet, too.

871
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,581
- What's going on?
- Is it a cyber attack?

872
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:16,184
- Unfortunately not.
At least not from this planet.

873
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,819
- Not from this planet?

874
00:59:19,156 --> 00:59:20,889
Do you mean to say that...

875
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,025
- If it is within our means
to locate the intruder,

876
00:59:23,027 --> 00:59:25,060
we will find him.

877
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,094
And retaliate according
to our defense protocols.

878
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:30,966
- Before I initiate
any protocols,

879
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,268
I'll need evidence.

880
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:37,005
Rock-solid, consistent,
indisputable facts.

881
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,107
- We'll get the facts.
But first...

882
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,045
We must disarm them.

883
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,279
No more cell phones.

884
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:46,281
No digital technology.

885
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:48,650
We have to put analog services
back in operation.

886
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:51,320
We use nothing
but landline phones

887
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:52,988
and couriers.

888
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,829
I agree. Go ahead!

889
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:04,900
ATTENTION

890
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,136
[printing press whirring]

01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,207
SEALED - DO NOT OPEN

892
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:34,062
- A special edition.

893
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,799
ATTENTION!
DO NOT TRUST DIGITAL MEDIA!

894
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:41,937
That's what comes of
all this high-tech crap!

895
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,912
- Hey! Young man!

896
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,391
- [sniffs]

897
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:06,928
Impure.

[sniffs]

899
01:01:25,315 --> 01:01:27,783
- Got a dry mouth?
- That's right.

900
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,985
[cellphone ringing]

901
01:01:29,987 --> 01:01:31,253
- Yes, Mom?

902
01:01:31,255 --> 01:01:33,288
- Who, Misha?
Say again.

903
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,357
- Hello?
- Who is Yulia?

904
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:37,759
[all cellphones ringing

905
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:38,960
- Hello.

906
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,463
- Do you collect stickers?
- No.

907
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:43,298
- Have you got our loyalty card?
- No card.

908
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,734
- Would you like one?
- I don't want a loyalty card.

909
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:47,436
- It won't take long.
- Yulia?

910
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,471
- You can register it
via the app.

911
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,907
- I get it.
No loyalty card.

912
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:54,443
No stickers.
I want pure water.

913
01:01:54,445 --> 01:01:56,411
- You can go
to our website...

914
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:58,080
- Enough!

915
01:02:01,952 --> 01:02:04,753
- Calm down.
Explain it to me again.

916
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:06,955
Which Yulia?
What apartment block?

917
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,257
- A terror attack?
Are you okay?

918
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,927
- The incident is interesting.

919
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:14,863
Yulia Lebedeva is wanted
on suspicion of extremism.

920
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:18,233
- Zora, are these your friends
doing this on the screen now?

921
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,102
- My parents said
it was up to me.

922
01:02:20,104 --> 01:02:21,803
I've made up my mind.

923
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:24,940
I want to do cybersport.
- An excellent decision.

924
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:28,477
Especially if you compare it to
studying math or physics.

925
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:30,378
Cybersport is the in-thing
right now.

926
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,315
But your top priority now
is to locate Yulia Lebedeva,

927
01:02:33,317 --> 01:02:35,784
who is charged with
several crimes.

928
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,454
- Yes, it's okay.

929
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,924
- Mom, are you calling me?
- I'm talking with your dad.

930
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,026
Who is Yulia?
Why are you telling me?

931
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,963
[cellphones ringing]

932
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,234
- Yulia Lebedeva is
still on the wanted list.

933
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,536
Any information of her
whereabouts...

934
01:02:57,107 --> 01:03:00,542
- Attention all units.
APB on Yulia Lebedeva.

935
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:02,210
Last seen...

936
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:06,948
- Why so much water?
- Water is the basis of life.

937
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:08,416
- An ID is the basis of life.
Got one?

938
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:09,518
- No ID.

939
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,786
- Where are you from?

940
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,120
- From here.
I live in Kushelevo.

941
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,489
- What is your full address?
- My full address is

942
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:18,860
Virgo Supercluster, Local Group,
the Milky Way, the Orion Arm,

01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:20,862
the Solar System,
Planet Earth,

Eurasia, Russia,

Kushelevo Village,
14 Srednyaya Street.

946
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:28,937
I have a job, a house,
and a vegetable garden.

947
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:32,474
- You can go.
Orion Arm...

948
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:40,282
- Okay, and what did she do?

949
01:03:40,284 --> 01:03:43,185
- She blew up an apartment block.
- Oh, my God.

950
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:45,086
- The whole city is up in arms.
You hear me, Lena?

951
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:47,823
- I'll call you back.
Bye.

952
01:03:57,568 --> 01:04:00,569
- Attention all units.
Searching for a gray Volvo...

953

I'd like to report Yulia Lebedeva.

- I can't talk now.
I'll call you back.

960
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:47,182
- Roma is in the hospital!
- What?

961
01:04:47,584 --> 01:04:49,084
- Our building was blown up.

962
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:51,219
I went out for a minute
and then...

963
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,321
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

964
01:04:53,323 --> 01:04:55,423
- Lena, calm down.
Where are you?

965
01:04:55,626 --> 01:04:58,059
- Your son was almost killed.

966
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,630
- I don't get it.
Why are you panicking?

967
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:03,665
- What don't you get?
We have to find her.

- Mom, is that Dad calling?

969
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,270
- Roma,
do your homework or I'll call the cops!

970

- Lena, listen to me.

971
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,607
If you see her,
call me right away.

972
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:15,410
- I'm listening but what have
we got to do with any of this?

973
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,412
I thought you were
coming home earlier

974
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,114
to spend time with Roma.

975
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:20,282
He has a concussion.

976
01:05:20,284 --> 01:05:22,284
We're in hospital.
I'll put him on.

- Hey, Dad.
- Roma!

978
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:27,022
- Did you watch the news?
That's Yulia Lebedeva.

01:05:27,658 --> 01:05:30,292
She's all over the internet,
too.

01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:33,662
- Roma, what...
- She blew up our house.

981
01:05:33,664 --> 01:05:37,032
- Why... How are you?
- I can't talk now.

982
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:38,566
The doctor is here.
I'll forward you a link.

- ...partially destroyed
a housing block...

984
01:05:47,144 --> 01:05:49,411
We can't confirm
the death toll.

985
01:05:49,413 --> 01:05:52,314
It's being updated continuously,
but the numbers are growing.

986
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:55,250
A hotline was established
by EMERCOM

987
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:58,320
which you can call to find out
if anyone in your family is,

01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,655
God forbid,
one of the victims.

MOSCOW -
CONSTRUCTION WORK ON LEVEDEV STEET

MOSCOW IS LOOKING FOR
YULIA LEVEDEVA

DO YOU KNOW YULIA LEVEDEVA?

- [exhales sharply]

994
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,717
- Local Police Officer,
Senior Lieutenant Fillipov.

995
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:30,685
- Hello.
- Hello.

996
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:34,022
A classmate of yours?
- Yes.

997
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:36,992
- Where and when
was the last time you saw her?

998
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,394
- At university.
- Who's at the door?

999
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:41,897
You're here!

1000
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,465
I've been waiting for you
for two years.

1001
01:06:43,467 --> 01:06:47,035
When are you going to shut down
the disco on the ground floor?

1002
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:49,471
- We will look into the matter.
- Please, do.

1003
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:51,439
- Let me know if you hear
anything about your friend.

1004
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:53,575
- We will.
We certainly will.

1005
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:57,078
- Grandma,
what are you doing?

1006
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,481
Have a rest.
- How can I rest?

1007
01:06:59,483 --> 01:07:02,083
Either I'm all alone,
or it's Grand Central Station here.

1008
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,019
Where did you hide
your friends?

1009
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:13,728
- Hello.
My name is Hariton.

1010
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:40,455
- So, is it helping?

1011
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:46,594
- Yes, she'll survive.

1012
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:51,332
But she is no longer
one of you.

1013

[water trickling]

1014
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:06,481
The pain is changing her.

1015
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:10,752
She's getting stronger
because of it.

1016
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:15,323
But the force that's growing
inside of her

1017
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:16,624
could become a risk
for us all.

1018
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,599
- Is that why Ra
wants to kill her?

1019
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:26,668
- Ra is an artificial
intelligence.

1020
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,136
It does not want anything.

1021
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:31,739
It analyzes event probabilities
and follows a defense protocol.

1022
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:36,544
- A protocol?

1023
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:39,414
- A mathematical one.

1024
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:43,418
One death is better
than multiple deaths.

Authorities are doing
their best...

1029
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:14,582
- What did she do?

1030
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:16,684
- Nothing much.

1031
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:19,671
- They're false accusations.

1032
01:09:19,672 --> 01:09:21,455
- I see.
Is she a political activist?

1033
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,791
- Something like that.
- What about you?

1034
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,228
- He's not from around here.
- I have a job, a house and...

1035
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:30,398
- He's trying to get her out...
of the country.

1036
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,534
And I'm just helping a bit.

1037
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:35,236
- That'll get you eight years
in prison.

1038
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:37,172
We can share a cell.

1039
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:39,240
- Is he also...

1040
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:41,209
- No, he is...

1041
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,746
- I am the only one here
to suffer for no reason.

1042
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:47,849
Nothing but stress since then.

1043
01:09:48,385 --> 01:09:50,285
You have anything
to whet my palate?

1044
01:09:51,888 --> 01:09:53,488
- Let me see.

1045
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,457
- What's the deal with her?

1046
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,459
Will she rat on us?

1047
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:01,963
- Let's drink to our meeting.

1048
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:07,268
Here you are.

1049
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,337
- So, your people...

1050
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:13,241
Can't they just strike us
with a death ray?

1051
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:16,811
- You have something like that, right?
- Even you don't do that.

1052
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:18,913
There are more effective
methods.

1053
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:20,982
- We've got missiles, too.

1054
01:10:20,984 --> 01:10:23,585
And we can strike back.
- Oh yes, we can!

1055
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:25,954
- That is a bad option and
could aggravate the situation.

1056
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:29,390
- So the idea
of annihilation is bad.

1057
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,228
But hiding for the rest
of one's life...

1058
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,396
Is a good one?

1059
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,368
- I will not do anything
that could hurt her.

1060
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:43,371
- Me neither.

1061
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:51,012

- How was that?
You okay?

1066
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:22,710
So you think
we should hide in the woods

1067
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:25,313
for the rest of our lives?
- We have no other choice.

1068
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:26,848
This stuff inhibits
your reflexes

1069
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:28,650
and impedes vital functions.

1070

- That's the point.

01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:32,587
So let's drink!

To the intergalactic union.

- Firstly,
I'm from the same galaxy.

01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,692
What's more,
there is no connection

between drinking alcohol

1076
01:11:39,396 --> 01:11:40,795
and the probability
of the realization

of the words you just
spoke aloud.

- Smartass!

This is just...

- To whom?
- The authorities.

You have no choice.

1090
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:39,987
Or you will go to jail...
as an accomplice.

It's either him...

Or us.

are you fighting for?

- He's heavy.
- Make an effort.

No one will believe us

if we don't bring
the alien in alive.

Put your hat on his head!

will he be joining?

- The Aerospace Forces.

1107

- Don't shoot.

1108
01:13:53,463 --> 01:13:54,996
It's pointless.
- Shut up.

They make you.

It's not that bad.

military officials,
and/or members of EMERCOM.

And above all:

Do not react to any

No judge, no trial.

- What's going on
with the internet and TV?

Was that your lot?
- Ra is after Yulia.

It decided to kill her
in order to keep peace.
