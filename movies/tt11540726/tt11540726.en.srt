00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,412
I really like him.

3
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:43,348
I just...

4
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:46,483
I don't know,
sometimes he just...

5
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:50,355
he just makes these jokes
that are kind of...

6
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,159
cutting.

7
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:53,853
Like...

8
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,163
kind of like he's
making fun of me.

9
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,695
He makes jokes at your expense.

10
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,171
Um... well, I think
he's just trying to be funny.

11
00:01:04,206 --> 00:01:07,207
But, um, yeah, I don't know
if I'm supposed to...

12
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:10,243
joke back or just...

13
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,608
Have you asked him to stop?

14
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,544
Yeah. Sort of.

15
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,547
And what did he say?

16
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:19,219
Um...

17
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:24,191
well, he said that I was
being overly sensitive

18
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:26,358
and that they're just jokes.

19
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:29,262
So he continues even
though he knows it hurts you.

20
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:35,268
Well, nobody else
seems to mind, I guess.

21
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,831
But if he cares
about you, he would stop.

22
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:40,570
You should tell him to stop.

23
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:43,705
I think he'd just say that...

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,839
it's my problem
and I should just get over it.

25
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:47,511
Well, then tell him to fuck off.

26
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:49,777
This guy's a sadist,
he likes to cut people down.

27
00:01:49,812 --> 00:01:52,186
You can tell him that.

28
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:55,420
He'd just say
I'm not getting the joke.

29
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:57,917
A sadist never understands
why others

30
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,656
aren't enjoying his sadism
as much as he is.

31
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:08,466
You should find someone
who makes you feel good.

32
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:10,435
Can you do that?

33
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,733
Yeah.

34
00:02:12,835 --> 00:02:14,571
Okay, yeah.

35
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,508
Okay.

36
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:18,707
See you tomorrow.

37
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,743
- Um, Margaret.
- Hmm?

38
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:24,944
Can you just promise not to...

39
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:28,288
to say anything about this
to anyone?

40
00:02:28,323 --> 00:02:30,851
Of course not.

41
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:32,292
Fort Knox.

42
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,434
- Good night.
- Good night.

43
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,751
- Good night.
- Good night.

44
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:45,491
Abbie is out for the night.

45
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,699
How's the wife?

46
00:04:56,999 --> 00:04:58,097
Fair.

47
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:00,539
I'm gonna go with "fair."

48
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,640
Mm-hmm. Could be worse.

49
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:06,776
Yeah, that's our motto.

50
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:09,581
We had that inscribed
in our wedding bands.

51
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:11,110
Hmm.

52
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,848
Peter.

53
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:14,014
Mm-hmm.

54
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:16,115
Do you ever draw?

55
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,658
- Do I draw?
- Yeah.

56
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,793
You know, drawing.

57
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:28,699
I mean, yeah.

58
00:05:28,734 --> 00:05:32,065
Uh... Chloe likes me
to draw with her sometimes.

59
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,001
Yeah?

60
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:38,071
The other day, she made me
draw Peppa Pig, 47 times.

61
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:42,812
Yeah. I...

62
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:45,947
I made a drawing the other day.

63
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:47,982
A nude? Of me? A nude of me?

64
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:49,621
No, it was abstract,

65
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:51,051
a geometric thing.

66
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:53,724
Can I see it?

67
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,793
No.

68
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:02,062
I hadn't drawn anything

69
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:03,569
in 22 years.

70
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:07,441
I used to do it all the time.

71
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,905
Constantly, hours and hours.

72
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,809
Forget to eat,

73
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:14,679
forget where I was.

74
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,948
Never told me that.

75
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,654
Well, it's not really

76
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:23,886
very important.

77
00:06:23,921 --> 00:06:25,855
So, what do you think,
further sex,

78
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,626
or you got to get home?

79
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:48,515
Hey, wakey, wakey.

80
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,451
Time to get up.

81
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:54,081
If you get up,
I'll make you breakfast.

82
00:06:54,116 --> 00:06:55,621
Hell no.

83
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,887
Oh, thank you.

84
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,658
Steamroller?

85
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:00,824
No.

86
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:03,530
Hmm.

87
00:07:03,565 --> 00:07:06,929
No! Mom, please stop!

88
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:09,129
Mom!

89
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:24,584
Good morning.

90
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,752
Through cell membrane
reorganization,

91
00:07:27,787 --> 00:07:31,217
1037 can play a significant part

92
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:34,594
in inhibiting metastasis
and tumor cell proliferation,

93
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,027
so, in short, it's potentially
pretty fucking great.

94
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,734
Interns, you guys
didn't hear that.

95
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:02,523
Hi, smidgen.

96
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,132
Seriously, Abbie?

97
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,073
Are you hungry?

98
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:26,206
I was gonna cook.

99
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,944
No need.

100
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:30,914
Well, you should eat something.

101
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:32,751
Are you having cereal?

102
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:33,884
Maybe.

103
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,589
Yeah, well, it's not a meal.

104
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:37,888
It's fine, I'm going to Lucy's
in a little bit anyway.

105
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:39,593
You are?

106
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,793
Were you planning on telling me
that you're going out?

107
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:44,059
I'm telling you now.

108
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:46,996
Yeah, but it would have been
nice to know in advance.

109
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:49,603
You know,
just a one-sentence text.

110
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:51,297
Is that too much of an ask?

111
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,875
I'll take it into serious
consideration for next time.

112
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,647
- Come on, let me make you something.
- Mom! It's fine!

113
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:02,880
I'll just get something
with Lucy.

114
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:05,784
They always have...

115
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,688
snack bars at these orgies,
anyway.

116
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:15,662
Wanna see something?

117
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:17,829
Um... I don't know.

118
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:19,028
Do I?

119
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:29,907
What the...? Oh, my God.

120
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,139
Abbie, is that your tooth?

121
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,978
No, it is, in fact,
not my tooth.

122
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,683
What on Earth is it?

123
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,245
I don't know,
I found it in my wallet.

124
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,148
You found it...
What are you talking about?

125
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:43,118
Seriously, just like appeared
in the change pouch today.

126
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,252
Look, it's got like...

127
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:46,924
tartar on it and shit.

128
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,025
Well, where the hell
did it come from?

129
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:56,131
Smidge.

130
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:03,105
Promise me that you'll be
careful on your own at school.

131
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,844
Gonna be reckless, ma.

132
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,748
Some frat guy hands me a pill,
I'm just gonna take it.

133
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:09,980
No questions asked.

134
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,883
That's not funny.

135
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:13,918
Sorry it's not funny.

136
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:39,812
<i>Now, let's
get busy. Come on, Jean-Louis.</i>

137
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,814
<i>Come along. Oh, that's fine.</i>

138
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,080
<i>- Who gets your vote?
- Scobie.</i>

139
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,346
<i>- He's the one who objected.</i>
- Hello.

140
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,249
<i>I'll take Tex's room
here and Gideon's.</i>

141
00:10:48,284 --> 00:10:50,152
<i>You take Jean-Louis with you...</i>

142
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:52,891
Oh, really?

143
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,993
Well, my friend, you're in luck.

144
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:09,303
They've got these, uh...

145
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:12,372
rustic individual bungalows
in the middle of the woods.

146
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,242
I'll send you a link.

147
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:15,749
What, in New Hampshire?

148
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:17,179
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:19,214
It's quaint,
it's maximum quaintness.

150
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:20,787
I'm listening.

151
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:22,789
I figure we can go up on...

152
00:11:22,824 --> 00:11:24,417
- Mm-hmm.
- ...uh...

153
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:25,924
on Friday night.

154
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,839
Hi, Mom.

155
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:41,302
Oh, smidge.

156
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:43,843
Hey. Hey.

157
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:46,307
Honey.

158
00:11:46,342 --> 00:11:47,946
It's no big deal.

159
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:51,180
Yeah. How'd it happen?

160
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,413
Riding bikes with Lucy.

161
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,020
You don't know how
to ride a bike.

162
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:57,923
Yeah, you never let me.

163
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,518
I let you. It's just...

164
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,927
it's dangerous, that's all.

165
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,489
Evidently.

166
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,527
Had you been drinking?

167
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:12,432
A little bit.

168
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,908
Okay.

169
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,976
All done.

170
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:30,087
Mom, can you please stop
tucking me in?

171
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:32,892
You have nothing,
nothing to be scared of.

172
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:34,487
- I'm not scared.
- No, I know.

173
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:37,589
It's just, everything
is going to be all right.

174
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,261
I know.

175
00:12:42,035 --> 00:12:44,563
Look, I'm...

176
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,940
I'm sorry that I didn't
respond to your text sooner.

177
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,604
I was at work and my phone
was in the other room.

178
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,276
I know. It's fine.

179
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:57,015
No, it's not fine.
It's stupid, it's just stupid.

180
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,984
Jesus, Mom, if you're gonna
eat shit about this,

181
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,491
can you please do it
in the other room?

182
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:03,087
I'm kind of sleepy
from bleeding all evening.

183
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,386
Abbie, what the hell?

184
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,861
Sorry.

185
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:12,195
Don't curse, please.

186
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:17,134
So I said, "Can't you just
do this one thing for me?"

187
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:20,907
And, uh, he asked
what he'd get in return.

188
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:22,942
And then what happened?

189
00:13:22,977 --> 00:13:26,077
I said he'd be happier

190
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:29,410
knowing that I'm happy.

191
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:32,578
Was that enough?

192
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,382
No.

193
00:13:35,517 --> 00:13:37,154
He wanted me to...

194
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:39,354
to do something for him.

195
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,259
Things for him.

196
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,196
What did you say?

197
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:49,331
I told him
that he's a piece of shit.

198
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,072
And I told him
that he didn't deserve me.

199
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,304
And I left.

200
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,504
- You said that?
- Yeah.

201
00:14:01,312 --> 00:14:04,115
You did good, hear me?

202
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,414
You're tougher than leather.

203
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,418
Just don't tell anyone I...

204
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:13,025
Of course I won't.
I would never.

205
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,290
I promise.

206
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:18,030
It's gonna be
a happy ending for you.

207
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:23,937
...typically
with replacement therapies,

208
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:28,469
such as different types
of therapeutic enzymes.

209
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:31,241
We have also benefited

210
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:34,475
from novel biologic platforms,

211
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,445
such as gene therapies,

212
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,678
which have proven successful

213
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,022
as part of
our development pipeline.

214
00:14:43,057 --> 00:14:46,487
The overall goal is to develop

215
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,490
a robust manufacturing process

216
00:14:49,525 --> 00:14:52,427
that aligns
with our recent focus

217
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:54,968
on product attributes

218
00:14:55,003 --> 00:14:57,366
and is critical in generating

219
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:00,204
quality target product profiles

220
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:04,241
for novel candidate compounds
in development.

221
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:07,079
Of course this requires

222
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,642
a tremendous effort...

223
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:32,203
Sorry, sorry.

224
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:33,633
Excuse me, excuse me.

225
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,635
Sorry. Excuse me.

226
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,346
Abbie!

227
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,743
Abbie!

228
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:19,514
What the fuck?

229
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:24,123
It's okay. It's okay.

230
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:25,421
Um...

231
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:27,192
Are you okay?

232
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,688
Yeah, are<i> you</i> okay?

233
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,459
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

234
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:31,823
I just...

235
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:34,562
I just thought something
might have, um...

236
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,204
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, honey, it's fine.

237
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,239
- What happened?
- Nothing.

238
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,374
I just feel a bit off.

239
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:48,477
I'm going to go take a shower.

240
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,743
Don't go anywhere, okay?

241
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,448
I love you.

242
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,595
- Hey.
- Hey.

243
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:44,698
Are you sure you're all right?

244
00:17:46,603 --> 00:17:48,240
I threw up.

245
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,374
Must have been something I ate.

246
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,245
I'm feeling much better now.

247
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,742
Do you wanna, like,
lie down or something?

248
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,579
Hmm-mm. What do you want
for dinner?

249
00:17:57,614 --> 00:17:59,284
Don't wanna cook.

250
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,715
I was gonna go to Lucy's.

251
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,487
I'm gonna need you to stay here.

252
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:07,391
I'm not gonna go biking. Okay?

253
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,228
You go out too much.

254
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,857
I go to Lucy's.
We play Elder Scrolls.

255
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,595
No, you get drunk
and then you carve up...

256
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,466
- Mom, I am 18 years old.
- In two weeks.

257
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,272
Stay home.

258
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,615
<i>This used to be quite a place.</i>

259
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,804
<i>It's been deserted
for a long time now.</i>

260
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,774
<i>- Will you take me in?
- Goodness no.</i>

261
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,249
<i>It isn't safe out there anymore.</i>

262
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:31,844
<i>That's why they put up
this barrier.</i>

263
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:35,947
<i>It would be very easy
to step around it.</i>

264
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,588
<i>What attraction could
there be for you out there?</i>

265
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:41,491
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

266
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:44,494
<i>I'm a reasonable person,
I don't know.</i>

267
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,694
<i>Maybe I wanna satisfy myself...</i>

268
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:14,875
- Margaret?
- Yes.

269
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,581
Um, I was just wondering

270
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,583
if you could sign off
on my hours...

271
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:23,081
It's not a good time. I'm not
available every second, okay?

272
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:26,887
Okay.

273
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:41,935
What are you doing?

274
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,511
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

275
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,942
That's fine, keep going,
keep going. Keep going.

276
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:52,077
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
- What is it?

277
00:21:52,112 --> 00:21:53,584
Just, just, just...

278
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:55,080
Here, here, here.

279
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:56,587
Come on, come on.

280
00:21:56,622 --> 00:21:58,083
- No, no, stop, stop, stop!
- What?

281
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:00,690
Okay, just stop.
I'm just not...

282
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:03,495
into this whole... thing.

283
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,398
- Okay?
- It happens.

284
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,829
No, no, no, it's not that.
It's not that.

285
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:10,568
I mean, you know me.
It's just...

286
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,473
Since when do we fuck
in the bathroom?

287
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:15,738
What's with the urgency?

288
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:16,937
I just felt like it.

289
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:18,136
Well...

290
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,907
it's not my thing.

291
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:26,012
If it's not your thing, you
shouldn't have agreed to do it.

292
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:33,052
Do you wanna go for a crawl
and get some loot?

293
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,119
I'm low.

294
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,859
You wouldn't.

295
00:22:37,894 --> 00:22:39,091
What the fuck?

296
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,862
Hold on.

297
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:44,965
Okay, now you're just
being creepy.

298
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,133
It's not creepy
to want to look at your child.

299
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,839
No, but you're doing it
in a creepy way.

300
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:53,446
Sorry.

301
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,008
Mom, what is going on?

302
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:59,012
You're being like... even more
suffocating than usual.

303
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,113
Just gonna miss you.

304
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:04,655
I'm... only gonna be
like two hours away.

305
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,788
I know, but...

306
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:09,792
who's going to protect you?

307
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:11,992
I don't need protection.

308
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:15,930
No. You're very strong.

309
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,536
But know that if anyone

310
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:20,671
so much as touches
a hair on your head,

311
00:23:20,706 --> 00:23:23,542
I will find them
and I will hurt them.

312
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:27,546
Mom, when you say things
like that,

313
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:29,581
I mean...

314
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:32,782
that's for you, not me.

315
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,521
I don't need to hear that.

316
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:39,756
But you seem to need
to say it an awful lot.

317
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,088
Yeah, well, I'm...

318
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:44,255
I'm just trying
to tell you that I love you.

319
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,026
Then just say "I love you."

320
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,832
I love you.

321
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,100
There you go.

322
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:56,003
It's that easy.

323
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:58,170
Hey, hey, hey.

324
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:00,645
What?

325
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,779
You wanna drink whiskey?

326
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,749
What?

327
00:24:05,784 --> 00:24:09,588
I figure if you're gonna drink,
I better show you how.

328
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:14,890
There.

329
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,531
Ready?

330
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,994
Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

331
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:27,298
What the hell is that?

332
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,707
Nothing.

333
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:31,544
1, 2, 3...

334
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,913
Come on, I raised you
tougher than that.

335
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:39,178
Again.

336
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,335
Nope. No.

337
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,679
- Nnn... no.
- Abbie, I haven't even picked out anything yet.

338
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,055
- Can you stop, please?
- It doesn't matter. I'm not gonna wear it.

339
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,255
Yeah, well, you can't wear
a sweat shirt every single day.

340
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,587
- Apparently I can.
- No, you can't.

341
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:17,194
If you go to school dressed like
that, people will think you're weak,

342
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,592
and that is not something
that you want to project.

343
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:22,628
Oh, is it not
something I want to project, huh, Mom?

344
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:26,962
Well, then maybe a cracking new
jumper would do just the trick.

345
00:25:26,997 --> 00:25:29,030
It would be just my ticket.

346
00:25:32,134 --> 00:25:33,573
What?

347
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:41,614
Stay here.

348
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:26,351
- Abbie.
- Are you okay?

349
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:27,957
- Come on, let's go.
- Why?

350
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:29,222
Mom!

351
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:30,960
You're hurting me, stop!

352
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:33,798
What are you... Why?
What's going on?

353
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,866
Why are you being weird?

354
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,232
Come on. Just come with me.
Come on, hurry up. Quick!

355
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,069
- No.
- Move it, Abbie, now!

356
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:43,940
- You're being fucking crazy.
- Abbie, just... just trust me.

357
00:26:43,975 --> 00:26:45,777
Just get in the fucking car.

358
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,009
Ow!

359
00:26:51,147 --> 00:26:52,410
Abbie!

360
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,887
Stop being fucking crazy!

361
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,322
Go away!

362
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:04,862
Abbie.

363
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:07,766
Look... this is just a...

364
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:11,297
it's a challenging time
for me right now.

365
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:15,070
There are factors
creating stress in me.

366
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:19,074
Your going away,
and work, and...

367
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:22,308
Don't be scared.

368
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:25,916
I'm on top of it.

369
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:29,755
Can you hear me?

370
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:06,528
...a clean data profile
showing anti-amnesic properties

371
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,827
and some neuroprotection
in some models.

372
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:11,522
I'll kick it to Margaret to
break down the trials for you.

373
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:13,227
Margaret?

374
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,363
- Margaret?
- Hmm?

375
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,333
The trials.

376
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,172
Right. Right.

377
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:25,844
It's, um...

378
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,542
Uh, if the phase, the phase...

379
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:35,249
a phase-one single
ascending dose, um...

380
00:28:37,121 --> 00:28:38,318
phase...

381
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:39,517
It's, um, it's in the packet.

382
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,859
It's, uh...

383
00:28:42,456 --> 00:28:44,423
It's, uh, it's in the packet.

384
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,194
Margaret, are you okay?

385
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,031
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

386
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,164
- Fuck!
- Oh!

387
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:51,133
I'm sorry. Sorry.

388
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:54,037
I mean, I... I apologize.

389
00:28:54,072 --> 00:28:55,302
I should go.

390
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:56,435
I...

391
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,309
So sorry for that, everybody.

392
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:05,983
Andrew, could you please get someone
to help us clean this up? Thanks so much.

393
00:30:26,934 --> 00:30:28,230
Go away.

394
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:32,531
Please, David.

395
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,874
Go away.

396
00:30:37,175 --> 00:30:39,505
You heard me.

397
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,276
Are you speaking to me?

398
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:45,313
Of course I'm speaking to you.
Why are you here?

399
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,644
What, in the park?

400
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:51,550
Stay away from me and my kid.

401
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,486
Well...

402
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,455
you approached me, madam.

403
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,193
I don't know who you are.

404
00:30:57,228 --> 00:30:59,129
Don't play fucking games.

405
00:30:59,164 --> 00:31:00,933
Why are you here? Why now?

406
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:04,134
Okay, you are mistaking me
for someone else.

407
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:05,630
You piece of shit.

408
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:09,337
You mother fucking
goddamn piece of shit.

409
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:11,141
Ben is with me.

410
00:31:14,113 --> 00:31:17,444
Right now, here.

411
00:31:20,218 --> 00:31:21,646
That is a lie!

412
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:24,286
Madam, if you're
going to raise your voice,

413
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,222
we're going to go...

414
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:29,555
we're going to go
back to the Boulevard.

415
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,997
Don't walk away from me.
What do you intend to do?

416
00:31:32,032 --> 00:31:34,659
I intend to go home, Margaret.

417
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:37,101
So you do know who I am.

418
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:39,202
You introduced yourself to me.

419
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:41,171
You came up to me,
you shook my hand.

420
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,470
You told me about Abbie.

421
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,639
Don't you remember?

422
00:31:58,652 --> 00:32:00,586
Stay away from my daughter!

423
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,495
"You introduced yourself to me."

424
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,662
"You told me about Abbie."

425
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,239
"We shook hands."

426
00:32:16,274 --> 00:32:17,735
"Shook hands."

427
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,118
Do you know this man?

428
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,647
Yes.

429
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:30,550
We were...

430
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:33,520
involved once.

431
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:36,292
Uh, when did you split up?

432
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:38,063
Twenty-two years ago.

433
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,231
- Twenty-two years?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,299
I haven't seen him
since I was 19,

435
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:46,665
and then about a week ago,
he just, uh, he just appeared.

436
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,667
At your home?

437
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:50,669
Or a place...?

438
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,507
No, at a conference,

439
00:32:53,542 --> 00:32:55,311
and then in a store,

440
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:56,609
and then again in a park.

441
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:57,808
Public places.

442
00:32:57,843 --> 00:33:00,547
Yes, but places
where I happened to be.

443
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:02,384
- It's not a coincidence.
- I understand.

444
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:04,716
I'm just trying
to get the facts.

445
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:09,325
Has this man accosted you,
harassed you?

446
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,130
Not exactly, no.

447
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:16,035
Okay, has he
initiated contact at all?

448
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:19,236
No.

449
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:23,603
But I know him.

450
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:28,278
I know what he's capable of.

451
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:29,345
Well, um...

452
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,380
what would you like us to do?

453
00:33:31,415 --> 00:33:34,251
I want you to issue
a protection order.

454
00:33:34,286 --> 00:33:36,616
At the very least,
I want you to contact him

455
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,255
so that he knows
that the police...

456
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,653
Those aren't really
options at the moment.

457
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:44,261
You're free to file a complaint,
and I can provide you guidelines

458
00:33:44,296 --> 00:33:47,363
on how to deal
with a potential stalker,

459
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,169
but unless you have something concrete
to show this man's harassing you...

460
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:54,337
Officer, I can't do nothing. I can't
just sit around and wait for him to...

461
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:56,273
There's nothing we can do.

462
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:58,209
So just...

463
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:01,773
be smart, be careful,

464
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:03,841
and don't hesitate to contact us

465
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,382
if the situation
escalates, okay?

466
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,444
Hey.

467
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,314
It's dark in here.

468
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:15,253
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:35:15,288 --> 00:35:18,817
There's only nine days left.

470
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:21,292
It all went so fast.

471
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,460
Um... I was wondering

472
00:35:24,495 --> 00:35:27,397
if you're going to be doing
my recommendation

473
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:28,926
or maybe somebody else?

474
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,632
- Me.
- Okay. Cool.

475
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,340
Um... good night.

476
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,343
Gwyn.

477
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:41,378
Yeah?

478
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,448
Do you think you could
kill someone?

479
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,585
Um...

480
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,422
I mean if you had to.

481
00:35:52,457 --> 00:35:54,424
Them or you?

482
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,957
Uh...

483
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,399
No, I don't think I could.

484
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,402
Why?

485
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,902
- It's nothing.
- Are you okay?

486
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:14,345
You know, if you need
to talk to somebody, I'm...

487
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,414
I'm actually,
I'm a really good listener.

488
00:36:19,044 --> 00:36:21,880
Have you ever done anything bad?

489
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:25,422
Like... like bad?

490
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:28,986
Yeah.

491
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,988
I have.

492
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,792
Why?

493
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:36,994
I did something bad.

494
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,897
When I was young.

495
00:36:40,703 --> 00:36:42,373
Unforgiveable.

496
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:45,310
Well, what was it?

497
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,643
I won't tell anyone.

498
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:50,546
I promise.

499
00:36:52,484 --> 00:36:53,945
Fort Knox.

500
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,689
I was 18.

501
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:03,724
And I, well...

502
00:37:05,024 --> 00:37:07,695
...my parents,
they were biologists.

503
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,698
They're dead now.

504
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:14,339
But after school,
I took a gap year

505
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:16,539
and traveled with them
from London

506
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:19,938
to a research facility
on the Queen Charlotte Islands,

507
00:37:19,973 --> 00:37:22,512
off the western coast of Canada.

508
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:25,944
I drew a lot back then.

509
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:30,454
I wanted to be an artist.

510
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:33,985
Thought that being in nature
would inspire me creatively.

511
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,659
It didn't.

512
00:37:37,694 --> 00:37:39,430
It was cold and boring

513
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,333
and there was hardly
anybody there.

514
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,996
But there was this...

515
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,933
man.

516
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:53,345
Another biologist
from some university up north.

517
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,809
David was his name.

518
00:37:58,011 --> 00:38:01,881
And he was handsome
and charismatic.

519
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,917
And he noticed me.

520
00:38:07,394 --> 00:38:08,690
Of course he noticed me,

521
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:11,022
an 18-year-old
in that remote place.

522
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:15,763
And he went about it right.

523
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:19,998
Charmed mom and dad first.

524
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:24,475
Oh, they just fell
in love with him.

525
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:29,909
Before you knew it, it was
the four of us all the time.

526
00:38:29,944 --> 00:38:33,484
He'd entertain us,
tell us stories.

527
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,684
Give me wine.

528
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,521
Pills.

529
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:44,462
After a few weeks,
I moved in with him.

530
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,401
My parents, they were...
they were hippies.

531
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:52,096
Naive, stupid.

532
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:55,506
I told them I was grown up,
and they believed me.

533
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,511
At first it was wonderful.

534
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,481
I was his muse, I inspired him.

535
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:05,681
He said he was on the verge
of a breakthrough.

536
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:06,979
I didn't question it.

537
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:09,179
All I knew was
that for the first time,

538
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:12,754
I felt important
and appreciated.

539
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:17,759
So I didn't object
when he started asking me

540
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:20,465
to do things.

541
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,468
"Kindnesses," he called them.

542
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:25,866
They were little things
at first.

543
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:27,967
Cooking, cleaning.

544
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,870
He told me not to draw.

545
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:32,037
Told me not to wear shoes.

546
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,006
Even outside.

547
00:39:36,714 --> 00:39:39,044
But the kindnesses,
they evolved.

548
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,618
Became tests.

549
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:43,587
Endurance tests.

550
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:46,953
Meditation for hours.

551
00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:48,592
Fasting for days.

552
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:50,088
Poses.

553
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:52,189
Stress positions.

554
00:39:54,226 --> 00:39:55,830
After a kindness,

555
00:39:55,865 --> 00:40:00,098
he would shower me
with praise and affection.

556
00:40:00,133 --> 00:40:04,905
The more I did,
the more inspired he became.

557
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,545
Said he could see the future.

558
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,581
Said he could hear God
whispering his name.

559
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,783
And I believed him.

560
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,953
I believed every
goddamn thing he said.

561
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:26,223
And whatever he requested,
I could hack it.

562
00:40:27,963 --> 00:40:29,259
And if I couldn't,

563
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,999
he'd tell me to burn myself
with cigarettes.

564
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,067
But I could hack that, too.

565
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:42,547
Winter came and my parents left.

566
00:40:42,582 --> 00:40:43,878
But I stayed.

567
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:47,211
I was so stupid and fucked up.

568
00:40:47,246 --> 00:40:51,116
It was five months before I even
realized that I was pregnant.

569
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:57,254
David told me
not to tell anyone.

570
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,993
He forbade me from giving birth.

571
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,568
I tried to stop it.

572
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,165
It kept growing.

573
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,641
And whatever I did,

574
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,775
no matter how much
I could take...

575
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:17,142
David wasn't inspired anymore.

576
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:24,050
I gave birth on the bed.

577
00:41:24,085 --> 00:41:25,623
No drugs.

578
00:41:25,658 --> 00:41:27,086
No doctors.

579
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,795
I looked at my baby and...

580
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,700
immediately I realized
why I'd been put on this Earth.

581
00:41:38,737 --> 00:41:40,836
I named him Benjamin.

582
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:46,809
For a few weeks
it was all right.

583
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:49,911
David didn't pay much attention,
but I cared for him.

584
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:55,884
I didn't think I could love
anything more than I loved David.

585
00:41:55,919 --> 00:41:58,051
But Ben proved me wrong.

586
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:02,825
David, David knew that.

587
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,602
One day he asked me
to go into town for supplies.

588
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:13,704
I'd never let my baby
out of my sight until then.

589
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:20,139
When I came back, two of Ben's
fingers were on the counter.

590
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:22,075
That's all that was left.

591
00:42:24,277 --> 00:42:27,817
I begged David to tell me
what he'd done with him, but...

592
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:32,591
all he'd say was
that he'd eaten him up.

593
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:37,255
"He's in my belly now, Maggie."

594
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,698
That's what he'd say.

595
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:43,866
Over and over.

596
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:47,969
So I went to bed
and stayed there.

597
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:50,774
I stopped eating,
my baby was dead.

598
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,647
But David, David just kept
saying he wasn't.

599
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,815
He was...

600
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:01,983
inside.

601
00:43:04,724 --> 00:43:06,119
Said he could feel him moving,

602
00:43:06,154 --> 00:43:08,792
said he could hear him crying.

603
00:43:08,827 --> 00:43:10,860
Crying out for me.

604
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,766
And after a while...

605
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:20,001
I could hear him, too.

606
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:25,138
Suffering.

607
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:26,678
Trapped.

608
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,176
But alive.

609
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:35,280
It went on for weeks.

610
00:43:35,315 --> 00:43:38,184
David wouldn't let me
come near him unless...

611
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:43,090
The kindnesses,
they became very hard.

612
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,423
And I did my best.

613
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:52,462
But I guess I wasn't
as tough as we thought.

614
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:55,971
So I ran.

615
00:43:56,006 --> 00:43:58,809
Stole some money,
the truck, and ran east,

616
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,713
to America, where I thought
he'd never find me.

617
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:09,446
I've never told anyone that
in my whole life.

618
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:11,151
You should be honored.

619
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,965
I don't understand.

620
00:44:24,804 --> 00:44:26,034
I let it happen.

621
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:27,772
I let him hurt me.

622
00:44:27,807 --> 00:44:30,236
I let him poison
my brain with lies

623
00:44:30,271 --> 00:44:32,436
and then I let him
kill my child,

624
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:34,339
and then I ran.

625
00:44:39,082 --> 00:44:41,181
I don't get it.

626
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:42,952
Is this...

627
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:44,415
Is this some kind of joke,

628
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,824
or is this a test for me?

629
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,024
Because that's horrible.

630
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,421
I'm sorry.

631
00:44:52,997 --> 00:44:54,931
I'm sorry, I...

632
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:58,033
I shouldn't have said anything.

633
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:01,102
Just go home
and forget it ever happened.

634
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:04,402
Okay.

635
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:07,504
Feel better.

636
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,755
"We shook hands."

637
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:19,318
"Shook hands."

638
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:20,891
"Then we went to..."

639
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,520
"I went to the Boulevard."

640
00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:25,764
Boulevard.

641
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:28,767
Boulevard.

642
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,322
- Thanks, hon.
- You're welcome.

643
00:47:02,357 --> 00:47:04,192
Good morning, Maggie.

644
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:08,229
Take a seat, darling.

645
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,474
You're beautiful.

646
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:24,674
Still beautiful.

647
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:26,379
You look like shit.

648
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:29,250
I know.

649
00:47:29,285 --> 00:47:31,252
Distinguished shit, all right?

650
00:47:31,287 --> 00:47:33,683
Get out of town. Now.

651
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:38,127
If you don't go, I will do
whatever I have to do.

652
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:39,326
I will.

653
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:40,690
Relax.

654
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,362
We'll be fine.

655
00:47:42,397 --> 00:47:43,627
All of us.

656
00:47:43,662 --> 00:47:45,464
Me, you...

657
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:46,938
Abbie.

658
00:47:46,973 --> 00:47:49,303
Are you threatening my daughter?

659
00:47:49,338 --> 00:47:52,471
Threaten? God no.
I don't make threats.

660
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,616
Seems to me, you're the one
making threats at this table.

661
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,113
You're goddamn right I am.

662
00:47:59,678 --> 00:48:01,612
So where's the father?

663
00:48:01,647 --> 00:48:03,317
She doesn't have one.

664
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:04,483
Oh.

665
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:06,122
Well, that's quite a trick.

666
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:07,519
No, it's not.

667
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:11,193
I went to bars, I met men.
It was easy.

668
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:13,063
Does she have your magic?

669
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:16,000
Your gifts?

670
00:48:16,035 --> 00:48:19,267
She's certainly not
a gifted cyclist, right?

671
00:48:19,302 --> 00:48:22,501
I went to the police. I can
have you arrested at any time.

672
00:48:22,536 --> 00:48:24,074
Arrested? For what?

673
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,208
Drinking tea in a diner
or sitting in a park?

674
00:48:26,243 --> 00:48:28,309
- What?
- Why are you here?

675
00:48:28,344 --> 00:48:32,511
Because he's still inside me.

676
00:48:32,546 --> 00:48:34,249
Here.

677
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:36,185
- Suffering.
- Don't.

678
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:38,220
- Every day he cries...
- Just stop it now.

679
00:48:38,255 --> 00:48:39,683
...he screams,
"Where is Mother?"

680
00:48:39,718 --> 00:48:41,388
- "Why did she abandon me?"
- Shut up.

681
00:48:41,423 --> 00:48:43,720
I tell him to let go,
I say, "Your mother ran."

682
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,722
- "She ran from her baby."
- No, lies!

683
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,065
But he refuses,
he just hangs on.

684
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,627
- He should hate you...
- You lying...

685
00:48:49,662 --> 00:48:52,069
- ...but he yearns for you.
- ...insane, fucking pig!

686
00:48:52,104 --> 00:48:54,434
You protest too much.

687
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:56,238
I know you know.

688
00:48:56,273 --> 00:48:57,470
He's alive.

689
00:48:57,505 --> 00:48:59,274
I've kept him so.

690
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,441
I took good care.

691
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:05,478
He's here, thanks to my charity.

692
00:49:05,513 --> 00:49:07,744
Any minute,
I could change my mind.

693
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,713
I could purge the boy,

694
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:12,353
put him out
of his fucking misery.

695
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:17,160
Thought you didn't make threats.

696
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:19,657
Well, if the boy's dead,
where is the threat?

697
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,332
What do you want?

698
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,136
I want...

699
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:28,567
a kindness.

700
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,538
It would be, I think,

701
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:37,411
right if, from now on,
you didn't drive to work.

702
00:49:37,446 --> 00:49:39,512
Instead you walk.

703
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:42,746
Barefoot, no shoes, no socks,

704
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:45,188
you know, every day.

705
00:49:45,223 --> 00:49:47,652
And then what, hmm? Then what?

706
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:49,720
I'm giving you a gift.

707
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:51,161
You see that, right?

708
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,131
Do this simple thing

709
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:56,694
and life goes on undisturbed.

710
00:49:56,729 --> 00:49:59,466
Till the next thing, and then
the next. I know how this works.

711
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,072
No, no, no, no, no.
I promise.

712
00:50:01,107 --> 00:50:02,634
You just do as I ask.

713
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,834
You don't follow me,
you don't meddle in my affairs.

714
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,837
You just do this and I vanish.

715
00:50:07,872 --> 00:50:09,410
You arrogant, fucking...

716
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:12,446
I don't do what you say anymore,
you understand?

717
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:13,744
I don't negotiate.

718
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:16,450
I don't take orders,
I don't look away.

719
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:17,682
So whatever you think

720
00:50:17,717 --> 00:50:18,848
that you're doing,

721
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,553
it'll fail,

722
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:23,292
because I'll be there ready.

723
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:24,524
Come after me,

724
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,295
come after my child,

725
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,264
I swear to God,

726
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:30,464
I will kill you.

727
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:36,239
You kill me, you kill him.

728
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:40,243
There is no him.

729
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:45,842
I just want you to be happy.

730
00:50:49,419 --> 00:50:51,188
That's why I'm here.

731
00:50:55,227 --> 00:50:57,392
Barefoot, every morning.

732
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:01,330
We wouldn't want
any more accidents.

733
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,130
Oh, fuck.

734
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:14,865
Happy now, you piece of shit?!

735
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,801
Now, you disappear.

736
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:18,902
Now, you fucking disappear!

737
00:52:28,485 --> 00:52:30,485
Naan?

738
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,322
I think you need
to see somebody.

739
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,488
Oh?

740
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:39,527
I think you're having
an episode.

741
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:42,266
What? Oh, no.
Everything's fine.

742
00:52:42,301 --> 00:52:44,334
You've got nothing
to worry about, I promise.

743
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,797
There.

744
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,304
There you go.

745
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:50,835
That said...

746
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:52,903
I'm gonna need you
to help me out

747
00:52:52,938 --> 00:52:54,872
by being extra careful
for a little bit.

748
00:52:54,907 --> 00:52:56,412
Okay?

749
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,447
If anyone approaches you
that you don't know,

750
00:52:58,482 --> 00:53:00,482
tries to talk to you,
you don't engage,

751
00:53:00,517 --> 00:53:02,352
you go away immediately.

752
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:04,849
Why?

753
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:12,329
Because someone is
behaving erratically.

754
00:53:13,563 --> 00:53:14,595
Who?

755
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,267
Someone from work.

756
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:18,797
Okay? Someone I had to let go.

757
00:53:18,832 --> 00:53:20,766
Is making trouble.

758
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:22,735
What's his name?

759
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,704
This guy?

760
00:53:27,577 --> 00:53:29,709
David Moore.

761
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:32,008
David Moore?

762
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:34,043
Yeah. British guy.

763
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:35,616
About 60.

764
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:38,289
You never mentioned

765
00:53:38,324 --> 00:53:40,291
any other British people
at your work.

766
00:53:40,326 --> 00:53:42,788
I did, I'm sure I did.

767
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:46,627
Okay, then I'll...

768
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:49,366
stay away
from old Brit David Moore.

769
00:53:49,401 --> 00:53:50,961
Stay away from anyone
you don't know

770
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:53,370
until I say "all clear."

771
00:53:55,605 --> 00:53:58,034
Here. That's chicken.

772
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,039
<i>...who was killed
in an invasion of his own home</i>

773
00:54:36,074 --> 00:54:38,778
<i>by a high-powered rifle shot
from some distance away.</i>

774
00:54:38,813 --> 00:54:41,550
<i>Seems to have come to some
sort of a conclusion here.</i>

775
00:54:41,585 --> 00:54:43,684
<i>The fugitive, wanted
for two and a half years,</i>

776
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:45,983
<i>James Cobb,
in part wanted because...</i>

777
00:54:46,018 --> 00:54:48,953
Why are you here?

778
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:51,923
I'm visiting a friend.

779
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,531
Come here.

780
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,573
What friend?

781
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:09,908
His name is, uh, David Moore.

782
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:12,680
No David.

783
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:14,748
No, there is.

784
00:55:14,783 --> 00:55:16,552
No David here.

785
00:55:16,587 --> 00:55:18,048
I know that he's staying here.

786
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:20,490
Rent room or get out.

787
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:27,365
Rent room or get out!

788
00:55:30,062 --> 00:55:31,534
How much?

789
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,165
Get out! Get out!

790
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,970
Now! Now, now, now, now, now!

791
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,940
Get out! Get out!

792
00:59:09,314 --> 00:59:11,985
Text me, on the hour,
every hour.

793
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,921
Just to let me know
that you're okay.

794
00:59:13,956 --> 00:59:17,793
Just, just write "okay."
Can you do that?

795
00:59:17,828 --> 00:59:21,357
How about I, uh,
I'll make it worth your while?

796
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:24,360
$20 a text, hmm?

797
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:27,231
That's a pretty good way
to make some pocket money.

798
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:28,903
Don't you think, smidge?

799
00:59:30,038 --> 00:59:31,136
Smidgen?

800
01:01:17,948 --> 01:01:19,178
Pow.

801
01:01:47,274 --> 01:01:48,746
What is this?

802
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,277
What the hell
are you doing here?

803
01:01:52,312 --> 01:01:53,982
- Margaret.
- What is he doing here?

804
01:01:54,017 --> 01:01:56,116
Relax. Why don't you
take a seat?

805
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,019
Can you answer
the question, Abbie?

806
01:01:58,054 --> 01:01:59,955
- I called him.
- You did... did what?

807
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,122
She's concerned.
All right, I'm concerned.

808
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:05,059
You haven't been to work in a
week, and Abbie says you're out...

809
01:02:05,094 --> 01:02:07,963
- You let a total stranger into our house.
- ...every night, all night.

810
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:10,207
- He's your boyfriend, isn't he?
- I don't have a boyfriend.

811
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:13,331
Don't treat me like I'm a fucking
infant, I know what you two do.

812
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:15,872
- Don't cuss.
- The point is, we're here to help.

813
01:02:15,907 --> 01:02:17,104
I'm fine.

814
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:21,075
You are not fine!

815
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,813
I need to talk to you
on our own.

816
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:24,474
Abbie, can you give us a minute?

817
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:26,982
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Can you go to your room now?

818
01:02:27,017 --> 01:02:28,049
- Please!
- Now.

819
01:02:28,084 --> 01:02:29,215
- Please?
- Abbie.

820
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,986
Go to your fucking room.

821
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:45,231
How dare you come
to my house uninvited?

822
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:47,563
It's important that I know
that you're all right.

823
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:50,346
Well, I am all right. As far as
you're concerned, I'm always all right.

824
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,437
Look, we're friends.
Okay, no, we are friends,

825
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,604
and when I see a friend
that's in trouble...

826
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,243
I am handling it, okay?

827
01:02:57,278 --> 01:03:00,015
I'm doing what I have to do
to protect myself

828
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,412
and my daughter from harm!

829
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:03,348
What harm? Margaret?

830
01:03:04,582 --> 01:03:06,417
It's none of your business.

831
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:07,957
Look...

832
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,190
I, uh...

833
01:03:10,225 --> 01:03:13,160
I have a number here.

834
01:03:13,195 --> 01:03:15,096
It's for a good woman, okay?

835
01:03:15,131 --> 01:03:16,526
- A psychiatrist.
- What the fuck?

836
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:18,902
No, just stop.
You are overstepping.

837
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:20,629
I owe you nothing!

838
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:22,939
If I don't return your calls,
you suck it up.

839
01:03:22,974 --> 01:03:25,601
You don't pop in and you
certainly don't discuss me

840
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:28,076
or anything else
with my goddamn daughter.

841
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:30,914
- What harm, Margaret?
- If you think that I would let anything

842
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:32,509
happen to her, you are mistaken!

843
01:03:32,544 --> 01:03:34,412
I would do anything,

844
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:36,953
sacrifice anything
for my children.

845
01:03:36,988 --> 01:03:40,286
For them, I'm unstoppable.
I'm a goddamn champion!

846
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:42,552
Children?

847
01:03:42,587 --> 01:03:45,489
When was the last time
you slept?

848
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:51,099
You need to get out.

849
01:03:51,134 --> 01:03:52,199
Oh, come on.

850
01:03:53,268 --> 01:03:54,498
- Get out.
- All right.

851
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:55,906
All right.

852
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,011
- This is the person I was talking about.
- Get the fuck out!

853
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:13,616
If that buzzer rings,
you don't answer for anyone.

854
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:15,288
Do not open that door.

855
01:04:15,323 --> 01:04:18,225
Do not leave this apartment,
ever, for anything,

856
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,996
unless I'm with you,
do you understand?

857
01:04:20,031 --> 01:04:22,460
You can't keep me as a prisoner,
I'm an adult.

858
01:04:22,495 --> 01:04:24,575
No, you're a child, and you'll
do what I fucking say!

859
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:38,146
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to yell.

860
01:04:38,181 --> 01:04:39,378
Hey, I'm sorry.

861
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:40,643
Mommy, you lied to me.

862
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:44,218
I called your office.

863
01:04:44,253 --> 01:04:46,924
Nobody named David Moore
ever worked there.

864
01:04:48,389 --> 01:04:50,224
Yeah.

865
01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:52,061
He's not from work.

866
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:55,394
He's from when I was young,
and he wants to hurt us.

867
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:57,528
But I won't let that happen.

868
01:04:57,563 --> 01:05:00,069
And I'm sorry
that I couldn't tell you.

869
01:05:02,601 --> 01:05:04,601
You're lying to me again.

870
01:05:04,636 --> 01:05:05,976
I'm not.

871
01:05:06,011 --> 01:05:07,538
Mom, there's no guy.

872
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:09,441
You're just...

873
01:05:11,148 --> 01:05:12,411
You're just saying all this.

874
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:14,545
You're just making this up
to keep me here,

875
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,645
to control me.

876
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,020
No, no, I'm not.

877
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,682
Mom, I'm... I'm all grown up,

878
01:05:19,717 --> 01:05:22,388
and I'm gonna go away
and you can't take it.

879
01:05:22,423 --> 01:05:25,490
No, smidge, that's...
that's not right.

880
01:05:25,525 --> 01:05:27,162
You have to stop.

881
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:29,692
It'll all be over soon...

882
01:05:29,727 --> 01:05:32,002
Whatever this is, Mom...

883
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:34,400
you have to stop,
it has to stop.

884
01:05:34,435 --> 01:05:35,698
I can't take it.

885
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:38,470
It'll all be over,
it'll all be over soon.

886
01:05:40,672 --> 01:05:42,573
It has to be over now.

887
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:46,313
Or I'm gonna leave.

888
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,746
I'll go.

889
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,715
I will.

890
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,783
And you won't be able
to stop me.

891
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:56,785
No, no.

892
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,556
Shh! It's all right.

893
01:05:58,591 --> 01:06:00,525
You're safe here.

894
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,626
I don't feel safe with you.

895
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:10,436
Come here. Come here.

896
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:11,701
Come here.

897
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,773
It'll all be over.

898
01:06:19,546 --> 01:06:20,743
Tomorrow.

899
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:23,680
I promise.

900
01:07:29,781 --> 01:07:31,649
You kill me, you kill him.

901
01:08:11,922 --> 01:08:13,889
Don't move.

902
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,495
I have a gun.

903
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,929
You know he's here?

904
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:23,536
He's right here.

905
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:25,307
That's why you couldn't fire.

906
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:27,903
He's dead,
and you fucking killed him.

907
01:08:27,938 --> 01:08:31,181
You know, he's very upset
that we're arguing.

908
01:08:31,216 --> 01:08:32,545
Listen.

909
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:34,778
Listen.

910
01:08:34,813 --> 01:08:36,351
You hear him cry?

911
01:08:37,453 --> 01:08:39,783
Shh!

912
01:08:39,818 --> 01:08:41,587
Listen.

913
01:08:41,622 --> 01:08:43,259
Can you hear?

914
01:08:44,757 --> 01:08:46,196
Can you hear?

915
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:49,595
Get the fuck off me, you fuck!

916
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,729
Listen. Listen!

917
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,238
Listen.

918
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:57,471
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.

919
01:08:57,506 --> 01:08:59,638
- Shh-shh-shh-shh!
- He's dead.

920
01:08:59,673 --> 01:09:01,508
Listen to your son.

921
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:20,956
He can't understand why
you allowed this to happen,

922
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:25,367
why you let him get hurt,

923
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:27,897
why you ran.

924
01:09:27,932 --> 01:09:29,998
What kind of a mother

925
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:33,639
abandons her child
when he needs her most?

926
01:09:35,511 --> 01:09:39,810
Are you going to fail him,
Maggie, again?

927
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:43,814
Is Ben inside me?

928
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,991
Stay away from my daughter.

929
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:00,732
She's just a substitute.

930
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,274
I held up my end.

931
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:07,343
But you, you followed me,
you tried to kill me,

932
01:10:07,378 --> 01:10:08,806
in breach of our deal.

933
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:10,676
I think...

934
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,843
I think this calls
for a kindness.

935
01:10:12,878 --> 01:10:14,977
Assume the position.

936
01:10:15,012 --> 01:10:17,914
In the park, Washington Park,
two o'clock till dawn,

937
01:10:17,949 --> 01:10:20,521
every night
until further notice.

938
01:10:20,556 --> 01:10:21,621
Right?

939
01:10:21,656 --> 01:10:23,392
Go near her, I'll kill you.

940
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:26,428
If you want to keep her safe,
then you do as I ask.

941
01:10:26,463 --> 01:10:27,726
It's that simple.

942
01:10:27,761 --> 01:10:30,927
I hold up my end, Maggie,
always have.

943
01:10:30,962 --> 01:10:33,699
This is not the time
for recklessness.

944
01:10:33,734 --> 01:10:36,636
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.

945
01:10:36,671 --> 01:10:38,033
I'll fucking kill you...

946
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:52,685
Mom.

947
01:11:00,398 --> 01:11:01,826
Happy birthday.

948
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,928
Don't come after me.

949
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:07,766
Don't call me.

950
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:10,967
Baby, I fucked up.

951
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,378
I just left him there...

952
01:11:15,413 --> 01:11:17,776
with that man.

953
01:11:17,811 --> 01:11:21,109
I should burn in hell
for what I did.

954
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:23,045
Go to the doctor.

955
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,322
You'll be okay.

956
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:29,689
What?

957
01:11:29,724 --> 01:11:31,889
Abbie.

958
01:11:31,924 --> 01:11:33,627
Abbie, no!

959
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:35,057
No!

960
01:11:36,896 --> 01:11:40,799
Abbie! Abbie, talk to me.
Come on, please don't do this.

961
01:11:40,834 --> 01:11:41,965
Just talk to me!

962
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,100
Abbie? Abbie!

963
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,839
Abbie, stop!

964
01:11:47,874 --> 01:11:50,578
He wants to hurt you!

965
01:11:50,613 --> 01:11:52,008
Abbie, don't!

966
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:53,812
Abbie! Abbie, open the door.

967
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:56,650
- Drive! Now, please! Drive the car!
- You Abigail?

968
01:11:56,685 --> 01:11:58,553
- Yes, I'm Abigail. Start the car!
- Please!

969
01:11:58,588 --> 01:12:00,621
- Look at me! Abbie, don't go!
- Drive! Drive!

970
01:12:00,656 --> 01:12:01,820
Abbie, don't go!

971
01:12:01,855 --> 01:12:03,789
Abbie!

972
01:12:37,055 --> 01:12:39,121
Motherfucker.

973
01:12:40,795 --> 01:12:42,960
What the fuck
are you doing here?

974
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:45,028
You fucking piece of shit.

975
01:12:45,063 --> 01:12:46,436
- Margaret? Hey!
- Shit!

976
01:12:47,604 --> 01:12:48,804
Were you fucking spying on me?

977
01:12:48,836 --> 01:12:50,132
- Huh?
- Stop it!

978
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,607
- Were you fucking spying on me?
- Fuck! Margaret!

979
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:54,004
Goddamn it.

980
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:57,513
- Why are you here?
- I was worried about you.

981
01:12:57,548 --> 01:12:59,713
What did I tell you? Huh?

982
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:02,782
What did I tell you? Stay away
from me. My children are in danger.

983
01:13:02,817 --> 01:13:04,217
I don't have time
for your bullshit.

984
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,752
You are sick, all right?

985
01:13:05,787 --> 01:13:07,556
You're sick
and you need help and...

986
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,689
And what?

987
01:13:08,724 --> 01:13:10,625
And I am in love with you.

988
01:13:12,024 --> 01:13:13,661
Are you fucking kidding me?

989
01:13:13,696 --> 01:13:14,992
Didn't you know?

990
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:16,631
Fucking men.

991
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:18,468
You can't stick your dick
in anything

992
01:13:18,503 --> 01:13:20,800
without deciding that you
love it or you hate it.

993
01:13:20,835 --> 01:13:24,067
You don't love me,
you just annoy me.

994
01:13:24,102 --> 01:13:27,741
Impede my mission once more and
I'll beat you till you're dead.

995
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:36,013
Okay.

996
01:13:36,048 --> 01:13:37,718
Okay.

997
01:13:37,753 --> 01:13:39,489
Fuck.

998
01:13:42,725 --> 01:13:44,153
Don't worry!

999
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:45,957
They're coming.
They're coming for you.

1000
01:13:45,992 --> 01:13:47,761
They're...

1001
01:13:47,796 --> 01:13:49,664
They're coming for you.

1002
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:55,164
No, no, no.

1003
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,572
No.

1004
01:14:05,682 --> 01:14:09,519
Abbie? Abbie, it's nearly 1:30,
and I don't know where you are.

1005
01:14:09,554 --> 01:14:10,718
Will you call me?

1006
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:13,182
Please, call me.

1007
01:14:13,217 --> 01:14:14,920
Just, when you get this,
just call.

1008
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:17,087
<i>Just, please, just...</i>

1009
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:18,792
<i>just let me know
that you're okay.</i>

1010
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:22,191
Shh! I can protect you.

1011
01:14:22,226 --> 01:14:24,666
I will keep you safe.

1012
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,097
I will not fail you again.

1013
01:15:58,256 --> 01:15:59,860
Yes?

1014
01:15:59,895 --> 01:16:01,961
<i>Uh, there's
a man here to see you.</i>

1015
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:09,199
All right.

1016
01:16:17,176 --> 01:16:18,879
Ballion.

1017
01:16:18,914 --> 01:16:21,915
The girl at the desk
said your name was Ballion.

1018
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:26,051
Ballion. What is that,
French or something?

1019
01:16:26,086 --> 01:16:28,350
I mean, what's wrong
with "Walsh"?

1020
01:16:28,385 --> 01:16:30,022
Maggie Mary Walsh.

1021
01:16:30,057 --> 01:16:31,661
It's a fine name.

1022
01:16:33,863 --> 01:16:37,128
So tell me,
how was it last night?

1023
01:16:37,163 --> 01:16:40,769
They still work, don't they,
the kindnesses?

1024
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:44,168
Ease the pain, quiet the noise.

1025
01:16:44,203 --> 01:16:46,269
Make you proud.

1026
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:53,749
Look at them.

1027
01:16:53,784 --> 01:16:57,280
They have no idea.

1028
01:16:59,383 --> 01:17:01,218
You do realize that I'm

1029
01:17:01,253 --> 01:17:04,188
the only person
that can see you,

1030
01:17:04,223 --> 01:17:06,993
who really knows who you are.

1031
01:17:07,028 --> 01:17:10,128
These people, they don't
have the first inkling

1032
01:17:10,163 --> 01:17:11,965
of what you're capable of.

1033
01:17:13,804 --> 01:17:16,134
You're a warrior.

1034
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:18,004
You're a champion.

1035
01:17:21,911 --> 01:17:23,042
Well...

1036
01:17:28,819 --> 01:17:31,182
I'm the only one that knows.

1037
01:17:31,217 --> 01:17:34,757
I'm the only one that can
see the hole right there

1038
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:37,859
in the center of your heart.

1039
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:40,862
This... life,

1040
01:17:40,897 --> 01:17:42,732
this...

1041
01:17:42,767 --> 01:17:45,097
character that you've created,

1042
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:47,869
Ballion, did you think
that she would fill it?

1043
01:17:47,904 --> 01:17:51,774
Did you... did you think
that this job would fill it?

1044
01:17:51,809 --> 01:17:54,271
You made a daughter
to fill the hole,

1045
01:17:54,306 --> 01:17:56,405
but even that didn't work,

1046
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,409
because nothing will heal you.

1047
01:18:02,083 --> 01:18:04,853
Nothing except him.

1048
01:18:11,356 --> 01:18:13,257
Come to this room tonight.

1049
01:18:14,997 --> 01:18:16,359
Ten o'clock.

1050
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,837
It's been 22 years.

1051
01:18:21,872 --> 01:18:23,773
Maggie.

1052
01:18:23,808 --> 01:18:25,742
Be with your son.

1053
01:18:32,476 --> 01:18:33,750
Fine.

1054
01:18:39,351 --> 01:18:40,856
Hey, boss.

1055
01:18:43,861 --> 01:18:45,322
Hey.

1056
01:18:45,357 --> 01:18:47,357
I... I just wanted
to say, I'm...

1057
01:18:47,392 --> 01:18:49,557
I'm glad you're feeling better.

1058
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,163
Thank you.

1059
01:18:53,035 --> 01:18:54,364
Tomorrow's my last day.

1060
01:18:56,874 --> 01:18:59,567
You haven't seen
that guy again, have you?

1061
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:01,272
What?

1062
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,077
You know, the asshole.

1063
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,081
Oh.

1064
01:19:08,116 --> 01:19:11,953
- No.
- Good. You're very strong.

1065
01:19:11,988 --> 01:19:13,416
Thanks.

1066
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:18,388
All right, see you tomorrow.

1067
01:19:18,423 --> 01:19:20,390
I helped.

1068
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:22,029
Excuse me?

1069
01:19:23,461 --> 01:19:25,395
I helped, right?

1070
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:30,037
I helped you with...
with things.

1071
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:33,007
Yeah.

1072
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:36,142
Of course.

1073
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:38,980
A lot of things.

1074
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,281
Good.

1075
01:19:44,922 --> 01:19:47,054
I'll make sure
your letter is glowing.

1076
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,555
Abbie, if you're watching this,
it means...

1077
01:20:08,077 --> 01:20:10,275
Abbie, smidge.

1078
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,947
If you're watching this,

1079
01:20:11,982 --> 01:20:14,081
it means that
something went wrong.

1080
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:20,417
I... I wrote everything down
in a letter a long time ago.

1081
01:20:20,452 --> 01:20:23,420
I hoped I'd never have
to give it to you.

1082
01:20:23,455 --> 01:20:26,258
<i>It is what happened to me.</i>

1083
01:20:26,293 --> 01:20:28,359
<i>Every word is true.</i>

1084
01:20:28,394 --> 01:20:31,934
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.</i>

1085
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:36,169
<i>I'm sorry I lied to you.</i>

1086
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:40,635
I thought that I
could make it all okay, but...

1087
01:20:40,670 --> 01:20:43,572
I was unlucky in what happened.

1088
01:20:45,444 --> 01:20:48,577
<i>But, Abbie, I was...
I was so lucky,</i>

1089
01:20:48,612 --> 01:20:53,923
<i>so, so, so very lucky
to have you.</i>

1090
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,060
A million deaths

1091
01:20:59,095 --> 01:21:02,690
would be worth the 18 years
that I spent with you.

1092
01:21:02,725 --> 01:21:05,264
I love you.

1093
01:21:05,299 --> 01:21:08,432
<i>I admire you.</i>

1094
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:12,139
<i>I hope that you understand
why I needed to do what I did.</i>

1095
01:21:12,174 --> 01:21:14,537
<i>And if you don't...</i>

1096
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:16,308
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1097
01:21:16,343 --> 01:21:20,345
But I know that when you have
children of your own...

1098
01:21:22,514 --> 01:21:25,350
you'll understand.

1099
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:28,386
<i>When you become a mother,</i>

1100
01:21:28,421 --> 01:21:30,553
<i>your own life doesn't mean
so much anymore.</i>

1101
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:36,966
You become disposable.

1102
01:21:39,432 --> 01:21:42,202
<i>Gloriously disposable.</i>

1103
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,655
Maggie.

1104
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:08,558
So glad you could come.

1105
01:22:26,545 --> 01:22:28,776
You look wonderful.

1106
01:22:28,811 --> 01:22:31,515
I tried to find
something elegant,

1107
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:32,747
but, you know...

1108
01:22:32,782 --> 01:22:35,057
there's a view.

1109
01:22:36,555 --> 01:22:38,555
And I got some wine.
Do you want a glass?

1110
01:22:38,590 --> 01:22:40,722
- Where is it?
- Hmm?

1111
01:22:40,757 --> 01:22:42,427
The gun, show it to me.

1112
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:43,791
It's in the river.

1113
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:45,727
No more of that now.

1114
01:22:48,369 --> 01:22:51,304
I got you a little something.

1115
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:52,569
Here.

1116
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:13,623
I saved it for you.

1117
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:30,541
I remember you drawing it
when I first laid eyes on you,

1118
01:23:30,576 --> 01:23:32,609
on the beach.

1119
01:23:32,644 --> 01:23:35,678
Every morning,
there you'd be on that beach

1120
01:23:35,713 --> 01:23:38,384
with your pad,
no matter the weather,

1121
01:23:38,419 --> 01:23:42,487
working for hours
on that same drawing.

1122
01:23:42,522 --> 01:23:45,226
You didn't know
but I was watching you.

1123
01:23:45,261 --> 01:23:47,195
I knew.

1124
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,131
I always knew.

1125
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,298
Of course, you always
saw right through me.

1126
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,795
You just watched and watched.

1127
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:55,764
Never said anything.

1128
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:58,173
And then there you were
at our place,

1129
01:23:58,208 --> 01:23:59,636
getting my parents shit-faced

1130
01:23:59,671 --> 01:24:01,704
on that disgusting
homemade wine.

1131
01:24:01,739 --> 01:24:04,608
- Oh, yeah.
- It was very clever what you did.

1132
01:24:04,643 --> 01:24:07,281
You knew exactly
what you wanted.

1133
01:24:07,316 --> 01:24:09,844
Yeah. But so did you.

1134
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:11,780
I was a child.

1135
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:14,387
A stupid child.

1136
01:24:14,422 --> 01:24:16,554
And you just kept coming
over and over.

1137
01:24:16,589 --> 01:24:20,822
But then one night,
there you were, at my door,

1138
01:24:20,857 --> 01:24:24,430
and within minutes,

1139
01:24:24,465 --> 01:24:29,369
a world that had seemed
so cruel, so disordered,

1140
01:24:29,404 --> 01:24:31,437
became...

1141
01:24:31,472 --> 01:24:34,275
immaculate.

1142
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:38,576
Do you remember
how stunned we were

1143
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:41,348
when the sun came up
and we realized

1144
01:24:41,383 --> 01:24:43,416
it had all been real?

1145
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:45,781
Of course I remember.

1146
01:24:45,816 --> 01:24:50,621
That time, the life we made was

1147
01:24:50,656 --> 01:24:52,590
holy.

1148
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:54,526
It was perfect.

1149
01:24:57,663 --> 01:25:01,500
God, Maggie,
I've missed you so much.

1150
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:09,838
It's too bright.

1151
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:24,754
We both missed you, Maggie.

1152
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:30,430
Yeah.

1153
01:25:31,664 --> 01:25:33,268
He's awake.

1154
01:25:33,303 --> 01:25:35,798
He's moving.

1155
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,503
Would you like to feel?

1156
01:25:40,904 --> 01:25:42,442
Come here.

1157
01:25:43,445 --> 01:25:44,708
It's okay.

1158
01:25:54,918 --> 01:25:56,456
There.

1159
01:25:56,491 --> 01:25:59,591
Feel the little hand
reaching out for you?

1160
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:01,230
Hmm?

1161
01:26:06,633 --> 01:26:08,303
You wanna talk to him?

1162
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:11,240
Talk to him.

1163
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:14,705
He can hear you.

1164
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,311
It's all right.

1165
01:26:17,677 --> 01:26:19,644
Nothing will happen, I promise.

1166
01:26:25,685 --> 01:26:27,916
Ben?

1167
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:30,655
Whoa, whoa.

1168
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:32,921
It's okay. It's okay.

1169
01:26:34,331 --> 01:26:35,726
Yeah?

1170
01:26:35,761 --> 01:26:37,827
He says hello.

1171
01:26:37,862 --> 01:26:39,829
Put your hand right here.

1172
01:26:41,767 --> 01:26:43,371
He needs you, Maggie.

1173
01:26:44,572 --> 01:26:46,275
It's okay.

1174
01:26:49,445 --> 01:26:51,808
Do you want to say hello?

1175
01:26:51,843 --> 01:26:53,744
To your son?

1176
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:55,251
Hmm?

1177
01:26:56,716 --> 01:26:58,551
Say hello to your boy.

1178
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:03,820
Hi...

1179
01:27:06,022 --> 01:27:08,022
baby.

1180
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:09,892
My baby.

1181
01:27:12,864 --> 01:27:14,699
Tell him how you feel.

1182
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:18,901
An-an-anything you want,
he's here.

1183
01:27:22,104 --> 01:27:23,675
Ben.

1184
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,843
Ben, I...

1185
01:27:28,814 --> 01:27:30,044
I'm sorry.

1186
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:34,884
I'm sorry for...

1187
01:27:36,492 --> 01:27:38,492
for being a bad mom.

1188
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:41,726
It's all right.

1189
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:43,662
He forgives you.

1190
01:27:43,697 --> 01:27:44,894
Maggie.

1191
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:46,467
No, no, no.

1192
01:27:47,701 --> 01:27:49,635
You're forgiven.
You're forgiven.

1193
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,834
You're forgiven.

1194
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:53,606
He loves you.

1195
01:28:11,824 --> 01:28:12,955
No, no...

1196
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:15,859
No, no!

1197
01:28:20,437 --> 01:28:21,568
Oh, David.

1198
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:25,440
David, he's alive?

1199
01:28:27,103 --> 01:28:29,972
My son is alive.

1200
01:28:30,007 --> 01:28:33,415
He is, yes. He's...

1201
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:34,878
He's inside you?

1202
01:28:34,913 --> 01:28:36,077
Yes.

1203
01:28:38,983 --> 01:28:40,752
- Suffering.
- No, no, no.

1204
01:28:40,787 --> 01:28:42,985
He's happy now.
He's happy now. You're here.

1205
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,624
He knows that you love him.

1206
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:46,725
- He needs to be fed.
- No.

1207
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:48,727
- He needs to be held.
- No.

1208
01:28:48,762 --> 01:28:51,400
- He needs his mother.
- He has his mother.

1209
01:28:51,435 --> 01:28:52,929
You're right here with him.

1210
01:28:58,574 --> 01:29:01,036
You just... you need to relax.

1211
01:29:01,071 --> 01:29:02,774
- I failed him.
- No.

1212
01:29:02,809 --> 01:29:05,040
No, he loves you.

1213
01:29:05,075 --> 01:29:08,109
I left him,
and you put him inside.

1214
01:29:08,144 --> 01:29:10,144
I had no choice, you know that.

1215
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:12,850
But I brought him back
here to you.

1216
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:15,919
Thank you.

1217
01:29:15,954 --> 01:29:18,152
Thank you for bringing him back.

1218
01:29:19,595 --> 01:29:21,958
I have him now.

1219
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:23,696
And he has me.

1220
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,029
And I think...

1221
01:29:29,935 --> 01:29:32,771
I think that we don't
need you anymore.

1222
01:29:35,644 --> 01:29:37,446
What are you doing?
Maggie. Maggie.

1223
01:29:37,481 --> 01:29:40,207
Just... come and sit
and we'll talk.

1224
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:43,650
I will do anything
for my children.

1225
01:29:46,523 --> 01:29:48,116
Shit!

1226
01:29:51,759 --> 01:29:52,890
Ah...

1227
01:29:52,925 --> 01:29:54,595
Maggie.

1228
01:29:55,994 --> 01:29:57,664
You need to calm down.

1229
01:29:57,699 --> 01:30:01,569
Baby's crying. He doesn't
like that we're arguing.

1230
01:30:01,604 --> 01:30:03,098
No, no, please!

1231
01:30:03,133 --> 01:30:05,100
Let's just talk,
let's just talk.

1232
01:30:16,586 --> 01:30:19,917
Don't move or I'll stab you
in the fucking neck.

1233
01:30:31,194 --> 01:30:32,699
Why?!

1234
01:30:32,734 --> 01:30:34,536
Why did you do that?

1235
01:30:35,704 --> 01:30:37,704
I can't fathom this.

1236
01:30:37,739 --> 01:30:39,904
I came to you
with the greatest gift,

1237
01:30:39,939 --> 01:30:42,137
and this is what you do.

1238
01:30:42,172 --> 01:30:45,745
Without me, there is no him.
Can't you see that?

1239
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:48,583
We're one, and we love you!

1240
01:30:50,246 --> 01:30:52,246
Stop that, Maggie!

1241
01:30:52,281 --> 01:30:54,182
Just... no more.

1242
01:30:54,217 --> 01:30:56,822
Just stay where you are!

1243
01:31:03,897 --> 01:31:05,732
Drop it! Just...

1244
01:31:05,767 --> 01:31:08,229
Just drop it! Yaaah!

1245
01:31:29,923 --> 01:31:31,285
No, Maggie.

1246
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,990
Please, no more.

1247
01:31:36,028 --> 01:31:37,665
No more, Maggie.

1248
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:41,900
We need to go to a hospital.

1249
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:44,100
Together, we can do it.

1250
01:31:44,135 --> 01:31:46,773
We can... fix this.

1251
01:31:46,808 --> 01:31:48,808
We can fix this, Maggie.

1252
01:31:57,819 --> 01:32:00,281
Oh, God, someone's hurt you.

1253
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,691
But I'll save you.

1254
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,154
I'll save you.

1255
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:10,863
We can be family.

1256
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:48,835
No. No, Maggie, please.

1257
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:50,034
Don't.

1258
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,037
You're killing him.

1259
01:32:55,437 --> 01:32:57,173
You're murdering your own son.

1260
01:32:59,210 --> 01:33:02,981
God, it stinks!
It stinks in here!

1261
01:33:05,282 --> 01:33:08,151
He was wrong, yes, so wrong.

1262
01:33:10,089 --> 01:33:11,990
You're a terrible mother.

1263
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:17,699
I am a good mother.

1264
01:33:19,428 --> 01:33:21,802
You're a murderer.

1265
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:28,072
You kill me, you kill him.

1266
01:33:28,107 --> 01:33:30,877
Then I'll have to do it
while you're alive.

1267
01:33:39,723 --> 01:33:41,316
Don't do it, Maggie.

1268
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,219
Please, please don't do it.

1269
01:33:43,254 --> 01:33:45,353
Don't do it, Maggie.

1270
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:49,357
Don't do it, Maggie.
Don't do it.

1271
01:33:49,392 --> 01:33:51,799
Don't do it, don't.
Don't, Maggie, don't do it.

1272
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:52,932
Don't do it!

1273
01:33:52,967 --> 01:33:54,428
Please don't do it!

1274
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,705
Arggh!

1275
01:33:59,171 --> 01:34:01,369
It's not my fault.

1276
01:34:02,438 --> 01:34:04,713
I just did what you wanted.

1277
01:34:06,277 --> 01:34:07,683
I would have done anything.

1278
01:34:09,049 --> 01:34:11,951
I came back, I came back.

1279
01:34:17,959 --> 01:34:20,091
Because I see you, Maggie.

1280
01:34:21,226 --> 01:34:22,764
I see you.

1281
01:34:28,299 --> 01:34:29,837
I see you.

1282
01:35:45,013 --> 01:35:46,078
Hey.

1283
01:35:49,919 --> 01:35:51,314
Hey, you.

1284
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:09,530
It's good to see you again.

1285
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:17,945
I saved you.

1286
01:36:37,395 --> 01:36:39,032
I saved you.

1287
01:36:40,233 --> 01:36:41,595
I saved you.

1288
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,442
Oh, shh, shh, shh!

1289
01:36:53,477 --> 01:36:56,445
Oh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

1290
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:58,249
Oh!

1291
01:37:41,195 --> 01:37:42,293
I'm all packed.

1292
01:37:47,333 --> 01:37:49,135
You want to hold him?

1293
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:54,536
Okay.

1294
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:58,980
Shh! Shh, shh, shh!

1295
01:37:59,015 --> 01:38:00,212
You got the head?

1296
01:38:00,247 --> 01:38:01,576
There you go.

1297
01:38:03,283 --> 01:38:05,250
Shh, shh, shh!

1298
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:20,001
Thanks, Mom.

1299
01:38:27,769 --> 01:38:30,077
Hey, little fat-ass.

1300
01:38:30,112 --> 01:38:31,980
Hey, you.

1301
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:35,346
Shh!

1302
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,052
Abbie-pooh.

1303
01:38:38,087 --> 01:38:39,713
And the claw!

1304
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:42,386
The claw!

1305
01:38:43,455 --> 01:38:45,026
Mom.

1306
01:38:45,061 --> 01:38:48,128
What? What is it?

1307
01:38:53,564 --> 01:38:58,171
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not scared anymore.

1308
01:39:01,374 --> 01:39:03,110
You made everything okay.

1309
01:39:04,707 --> 01:39:06,443
So I'm not scared.

1310
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:12,713
Oh, shh!

1311
01:39:12,748 --> 01:39:15,518
It's okay, huh?

1312
01:39:15,553 --> 01:39:18,422
It's okay.

1313
01:39:18,457 --> 01:39:20,259
It's okay.

1313
01:39:21,305 --> 01:40:21,213
