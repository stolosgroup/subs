2
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,062
That's my dad.

3
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,401
I remember that day.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,863
And believe it or not, I remember that hit.

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,617
I remember it because of the smile
that spread over my dad's face.

6
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,336
Yeah, I'd have stood there all day
just to sink one.

7
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,256
Just to see that smile.

8
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,302
You see, to Pop, sports were a religion.

9
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,471
To me, it was about purity.

10
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:40,809
Sports was a place
where all wrongs could be made right.

11
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:46,106
I thought if I filled the whole house
with trophies for him, he'd stick around.

12
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,567
Well, I did.

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,819
He left before my tenth birthday.

14
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,077
The Championship
has come down to this final play.

15
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,247
The Sun Devils trail by four.
The ball on the Aztec 15.

16
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,999
Seven seconds left on the clock.

17
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,836
Settle it down.
Pro-right tiger. This is your game.

18
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,507
Now, let's go. Let's go get 'em.
Now, let's go! Let's go!

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,010
Sun Devils' ball.
First down and ten yards to go.

20
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,846
Here we go, men, last play.
It's fun time!

21
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,268
Pro-right tiger. Wide check. 532 double fly
on two, Scottie. Guaranteed TD.

22
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,229
We gotta worry about one thing, men.

23
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,607
After we win this game
they'll be putting cameras in your faces.

24
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,443
Don't give them "Hi, Mom's and shit."
It's overused.

25
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,238
You gotta thank somebody, thank me.

26
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,157
- I'll see you in the end zone, men. Ready?
- Break!

27
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,077
I was a quarterback
since peewee football -

28
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,706
set high-school records, won
state championships. This was perfect.

29
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,292
Coming at you, 57.

30
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,380
Bowl game, national TV,
there were pro scouts in the stands,

31
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,924
and I knew exactly
what was gonna happen next.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,761
Lang has led the Sun
Devils to four comebacks this season.

33
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:01,723
Can he do it?
Win their first bowl game in 12 years?

34
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:06,395
Lang barks the signals. The Aztecs have
eight in the box. They're showing blitz.

35
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,939
Lang takes the snap,
fades back into the pocket.

36
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,900
He looks for Ravis on the right.
Sherman breaks through.

37
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:15,028
Lang's in trouble. He shakes Sherman off,
nearly goes down.

38
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:20,242
He's looking to throw. Two seconds to go.
There he goes. He's going to run it.

39
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,704
He's got to get in the end zone.
And that safety is stepping up.

40
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,123
Can he make it?

41
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,627
- Touchdown!
- Argh!

42
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,258
My first thought was I could tape it
and play next week. Then I puked.

43
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:45,934
When do I play again, Doc?
What's the rehab time?

44
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,270
I'm not sure, son.

45
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,661
Football wasn't a sport.

46
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,997
It was my life.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,750
And I wasn't gonna give up now.

48
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,044
I would play again.

49
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,507
In the meantime I needed a job
to hold me over between tryouts.

50
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,842
Then one day, and it didn't take long,

51
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,429
six years had passed
and I woke up at the bottom.

52
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,973
"You have reached
the Jessica Simpson hotline."

53
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,018
Jessica will tell you
about Nick's birthday party,

54
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,813
and a whole lot more about
her rocking new panty line at Wal-Mart.

55
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,485
But first here's a little fan trivia
to win a VIP gold-package backstage pass

56
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:39,112
"to Jessica's Omnicon Hotel summer tour."

57
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,532
- Lang.
- "The question..." I'm taping, boss.

58
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,452
Look. I got a job for you. Bauer's sick.
I can't update his betting line.

59
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:48,247
- You know anything about sports?
- Yeah, a little.

60
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,418
900 numbers, audio text.
The racket had a lot of names.

61
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:58,590
This guy's gig was sports handicapping -
predicting winners for people who bet.

62
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,301
I was supposed to just record his picks.

63
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,346
Thing was, I didn't agree with them.

64
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,306
No, they're not.

65
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:12,729
Living in Las Vegas, it was easy to gauge
the temperature of the betting public.

66
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,148
The problem is they're usually wrong.

67
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:18,652
What's up, Stu?
Where's all the action this weekend?

68
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,530
Tampa-Oakland.
Everyone's jumping on Oakland.

69
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,574
- That's crazy.
- You think?

70
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,702
Yeah, man.
That game's gonna be won by coaching.

71
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,997
Gruden put that Oakland team together
before he came to Tampa.

72
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,082
He knows every strength and weakness.

73
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:37,212
Brown catches to his left, so he'll have
him double-teamed to the defender's right.

74
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,506
Gannon throws on a three-step drop.

75
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,093
He'll stack the midfield with line backers,
take away the short pass.

76
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,470
Gannon will throw three or four NTs Sunday.

77
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,556
Fuck me.

78
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,184
- You took Oaktown?
- Yeah, what do you think?

79
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,437
I think I gotta
save your ass one more time.

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,066
Take Tampa Bay on the money line.
They're gonna win this game outright.

81
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,068
- Bet 'em big.
- Thanks, B.

82
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,031
Stu did bet 'em big,
and he won ten grand.

83
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,827
I was quickly becoming
the biggest 900 line in Vegas.

84
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,415
"Kansas City is seven to one against
point spread v division opponents"

85
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:17,544
"coming off a Monday night game.
Take KC minus the six."

86
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:24,426
"Call tomorrow for my pro-football game
of the year. That's here at 900-656-3100."

87
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:29,765
"Until then, this is Brandon Lang
saying good night and good gambling."

88
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,268
Big plans this weekend?

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,395
There you go.

90
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,651
Steve. I went nine and two
on pro football Sunday,

91
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,278
and hit my third straight
Monday-night parlay.

92
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,990
- It's worth 12 bucks an hour.
- Hey, I don't make 12 an hour.

93
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,409
You're not picking 75%.

94
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,663
If you're that good, why don't you
bet your own games, get rich?

95
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,873
Send me a postcard from the Riviera.

96
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,339
What's going on, Denny?

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,466
Hey, man. What's up?

98
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,845
Big bro's making them greenbacks.
How about you, bro?

99
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,973
I scrounged up some old headers, B.
Check it out. Fire it up.

100
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,891
All right, here goes.

101
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:20,107
Jeez, I'm late. Honey, dinner's in the oven.
Where the hell's my lucky crucifix?

102
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,820
Oh, I forgot to tell you. The mail came
and there's a letter for you from Chicago.

103
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,656
You just went there
for your tryout last week.

104
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,786
Another rejection letter.
"...strength of your knee in question."

105
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,083
I only had two Arena teams left,
and after that there was always the CFL.

Should I ride shotgun
or do you want to hop on the handlebars?

112

Hey, the packaging's not that great,

00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,631
This is Brandon.

120
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,968
Congratulations, you went nine and two
last Sunday. This is Walter Abrams.

121
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,722
I don't know if you know me. I run
the biggest sports service in the country,

122
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,682
and I'm a big fan of yours, Brandon.

123
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,644
As a matter of fact,
I've got a poster of you on my wall.

124
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,523
- This is a joke, right?
- No, this is not a joke. This is a job offer.

125
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:47,861
In your top drawer- go ahead, open it up -
there's an envelope with your name on it.

126
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:52,533
Now, that's travel cash and an airline
ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon.

127
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,326
I paid someone to put it there,

128
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,288
who told me that the place you're in
reminded him of a Turkish prison.

129
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:01,375
Now, all I'm asking you to do
is come up with a number.

130
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,795
You write down the number
of what you make now, you cross it out,

131
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,922
you write what you should be making,

132
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,385
and then toss in how much it's gonna take
to get you to fly to New York first-class

133
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,595
and come work for me.

134
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,056
Now, focus, Brandon, focus.

135
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,769
With your bum knee, a comeback
is just a dream. My offer is real.

136
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,105
- Run the numbers, do the math.

137
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,774
Hold on a second. Yeah.

138

Mom holding two jobs,
Denny going to college,

139

this looked like a chance
to make some real money.

140
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,451
And besides, I'd never seen New York
and New York had never seen me.

141
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,328
Oh, goodness. Hey.

- Two weeks.

146

♪ "I'm your pusherman"

151
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,821
♪ "I'm your pusherman"

152
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,839
That's OK.

153
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,926
All right, double it. Triple it.

154
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,470
No, everything's about money.

155
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:41,767
Listen, this Sunday my little girl,
an angel, turns six.

156
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,685
This is not likely to happen again.

157
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,523
She loves elephants.
Your circus has ten. I only need one.

158
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:52,903
Now, my little girl's happiness
is in your hands.

159
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,531
I don't need advice
from a guy who doubles as a clown.

160
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:59,034
I need a fucking elephant.
Now, I'm willing to pay.

161
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:04,122
What'll it take to grease your wheels
and get one here this weekend? Hello?

162
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,416
Fuckwad!

163
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,128
Find Ringling Brothers. Get someone
who understands profit. Whoa!

164
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,005
Brandon Lang.

165
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,174
The Marlboro man here.

166
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,969
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, you're in great shape.

167
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,556
- I've been in better.
- You're modest too. Oh!

168
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,434
Modesty - not a virtue.
Could be a vice. Sit down.

169
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,770
There are rules to success, my friend.

170
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:30,315
Rule number one is know what you know,
know what you don't know,

171
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,986
and know that I gotta know everything
you know as soon as you know it.

172
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,363
- Sooner.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,907
- You ever sell before?
- No.

174
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,327
- Are you religious?
- I believe in God.

175
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,496
Hey, Liz.

176
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,500
This is me 30 years ago, right?
It's remarkable the resemblance.

177
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:51,461
I mean, he's a little taller. I'll give him that.

178
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:57,050
Oh, boy, you know, I'm not supposed
to do this. It's bad for my... condition.

179
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,762
Nobody knows this, Liz, OK?

180
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,640
So before I die...

181
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,727
Did you do anything
other than sports phone in Vegas?

182
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,688
Just the 900 recordings,
you know, 10 bucks a call.

183
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,148
That's chump change.

184
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,026
I mean, we're going after
much bigger fish here.

185
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:18,030
You know, networks don't talk about it,
government can't tax it,

186
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,617
but sports betting
is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year business.

187
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,784
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:25,913
A lot of gamblers out there, man,
and they have needs.

189
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:32,127
And come Monday morning after a losing
weekend, they got big needs. Gargantuan.

190
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,633
See that? That's every
football game played last Sunday.

191
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,303
You know why Monday-night football's
the most watched game of the week?

192
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,557
Monday's the last chance bettors have
to climb out of the hole they got in

193
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,601
to pay their bookies on Tuesday.

194
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,772
Sports betting's illegal in 49 states,
including this one.

195
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,815
But what we do is not.

196
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:57,903
We are 100% legal, like stockbrokers,

197
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:02,157
only instead of counting stocks,
we advise people on how to bet.

198
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:07,538
Now, if a client wins by taking our advice,
we get a percentage, or we ask for one,

199
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,708
which they will gladly give us because
they want to keep getting the advice.

200
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,920
But if they lose, we get zip.

201
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:21,677
So the object here, my dear,
tall, athletic, religious friend, is to win.

202
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,137
I can do that.

203
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,185
- Hello. This is Walter...
- Hello, Walter.

204
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,939
That's my cable show.

205
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,234
Now, after a nice
five-day vacation on my yacht...

206
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:42,030
Airs Saturday and Sunday morning
nationwide. We tape Thursday and Fri...

207
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,907
What's going on with my hair?

208
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,702
He did it again, Liz.

209
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,247
I got one part of my head in Cleveland,
the other's in Chicago.

210
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,209
What are we gonna do with this guy?
My barber. Should be shot. I want him dead.

211
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,628
For the first time,

212
00:13:56,712 --> 00:14:01,800
I'm gonna release our three-team
college and pro parlays absolutely free.

213
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:06,638
If all the picks are free,
how'd you get the yacht?

214
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:08,599
There's no yacht.

215
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,559
Next question.

216
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:15,480
Why give any picks for free?
Why not charge a fee up-front initially?

217
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,609
You make a good point. Next.

218
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,652
What's on the second floor?

219
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,697
That's where we print the money.

220
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,576
- Anything else?
- Of course not.

221
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,205
No, I think I've got it.
I think everything's crystal clear, Walter.

222
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:35,501
I like you, you know that?
You and me - this thing's gonna work.

223
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,087
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

224
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,173
Ringling Brothers on one.

225
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:45,177
Tell them to hold that elephant.
You ever have a manicure?

226
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,012
There's a girl you gotta meet.

227
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:52,100
- Yeah? What's she like?
- She's beautiful. You're gonna like her.

228
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,727
Is this Barnum or Bailey?

229
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,485
- I've got it.
- He's all yours.

230
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,362
- Brandon?
- Yeah.

231
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,239
- Hi. I'm Toni.
- Nice to meet you.

232
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,366
Walter said you'd stop by.

233
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,785
- This was his idea.
- Yeah, I know.

234
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,287
Does he make
all of his employees do this?

235
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,373
- Yep. Every one.
- How often?

236
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,959
Once. Before they start work.

237
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,211
- Weird.
- You think?

238
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,797
I never had my nails done before.

239
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,259
Yeah, I can see that,
but you've got strong hands. That's nice.

240
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,135
Do you drink?

241
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,512
Excuse me?

242
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:32,140
- Alcohol. Are you a drinker?
- I have a beer every once in a while.

243
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,852
- Do you smoke?
- No.

244
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,855
- What about gambling?
- What about it?

245
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit pressed for time.

246
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,652
- I asked, do you bet? Are you a bettor?
- No.

247
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,821
Really?

248
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,656
Why not?

249
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,909
Toni, huh?

250
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:56,665
- Are you here full time?
- Yeah, no, this is my shop. I better be.

251
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,209
So why don't you gamble?

252
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:03,589
Well, I did once.
I wagered everything I had and I lost.

253
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,007
So?

254
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,093
I just swore I'd never do it again.

255
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,304
- You're sticking to that story?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,015
I'm not gonna start
this relationship off by lying.

257
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:18,020
That's good. Walter could definitely use
someone with a little resolve in his life.

258
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,982
Hey, Toni.

259
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,443
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

260
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,445
What do you say?

261
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,489
- He didn't tell you.
- Tell me what?

262
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,867
Brandon, Walter and I are married.

263
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,039
Oh. Oh, bogey. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

264
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,957
He said to come to meet a nice lady...

265
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,835
I'm sure he did.
That's OK. I'll kill him when I get home.

266
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,465
He has a big, bright, beautiful spirit,
though, and you will love working for him.

267
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,425
But he is held together by meetings.

268
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,553
If it has "anonymous" at the end,
he goes. He has to.

269
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:54,264
He also has to be careful
who he lets into his life.

270
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:58,268
Most ways, Walter's brilliant,
but he can be bullshitted and I can't.

271
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,270
He sends them to me before hiring them.

272
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:02,940
- So this was my interview.
- Oh, you're swift.

273
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,733
How'd I do?

274
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:08,278
Except for an illegal forward pass, perfect.
Congratulations.

275
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,655
Thank you very much.

276
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,282
1-800-238-6648.

277
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,744
1-800, bet on it. Absolutely free.

278
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,623
This is the first floor,
and it's all yours.

279
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:24,002
The TV's satellite, and it swivels.

280
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,213
Your bedroom.

281
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:30,092
Got a Jacuzzi in there
the size of a kiddy pool.

282
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,596
You know what this is?
Looks like weights to me.

283
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,765
Yeah, baby.

284
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:40,143
Now, I'm gonna put your copy here...

285
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,688
on your desk.

286
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,648
Walter, this is sweet ass.

287
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,819
- A man's chair.
- That's what I'm talking about.

288
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:54,449
OK. I'm gonna start you on the 900 numbers.
Same gig you had in Vegas.

289
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:58,787
Make your picks, record them each day.
Monday through Friday, once a day.

290
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,873
- Five times a day on a weekend.
- Mm-hm.

291
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,959
Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot.

292
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:07,337
Now, we're doing about
three dozen hits a week. That's nothing.

293
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,047
We should triple that.

294
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:14,595
Now, before you get into your test copy
here, I got a few words for you.

295
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:17,014
Your pitch sucks. No offense.

296
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:21,143
But you got potential,
so we gotta find a way to bust you out.

297
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:22,728
- Bust me out?
- Yeah.

298
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:26,231
We're gonna start
by giving you a new name.

299
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:30,152
John Anthony. Just came to me.

300
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,697
John Anthony, the million-dollar man.

301
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,574
What's wrong with Brandon Lang?

302
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:40,120
Nothing's wrong with Brandon Lang.
It's just that he's still living with his mommy.

303
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:42,039
John Anthony's living large.

304
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,417
He don't hold back.
He's got a direct line to God.

305
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:50,339
And for a measly 25 bucks a call,
he's gonna let the world's losers listen in.

306
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,716
"Hello, sports fans."

307
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,887
"This is John Anthony in the Big Apple
with my big-money picks."

308
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,515
"The action starts Saturday
with college ball,"

309
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:03,060
"and our first match-up
is Michigan against Indiana."

310
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,437
"The Wolverines..."

311
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:06,897
I already hung up.

312
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,400
John Anthony here, ready to make
all your betting dreams come true.

313
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:13,654
That's right.
Call me right now and let me win for you.

314
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,533
The point spread
in the Indiana-Michigan game is at...

315
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,535
- I think it's all right.
- Wrong.

316
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,914
Mm-hm.

317
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,666
OK, what's your sales pitch?

318
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:29,461
My sales pitch is I'm picking 80% winners.

319
00:19:30,546 --> 00:19:32,548
Stats is not enough.

320
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm telling you, you need a voice.

321
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:39,721
These are gamblers ready to risk what
they can't afford for what they can't have.

322
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,224
You're selling
the world's rarest commodity.

323
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:44,810
You're selling certainty...

324
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,354
in an uncertain world.

325
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:59,032
John Anthony here,
the million-dollar man.

326
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:03,537
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood. All
your big money stays and plays with me.

327
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,584
Sit back and relax. It's a Scud attack this
weekend. I am shelling your bookmaker.

328
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,379
Follow his block and cut to the right.
Going in, Liz. Going in.

329
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,799
That's it, isn't it? Huh?

330
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,678
- It's a start.
- It's a start?

331
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,306
What can I tell you?

332
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:26,476
That's not what you want,
then you need to find somebody else to sell

333
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,687
and let me just pick.

334
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,939
It's not about what I want.

335
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,400
You understand?
It's about what Brandon wants.

336
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,778
If I hear that, I'm calling this number.

337
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

338
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,619
What is it? What is it? What is it?

339
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,162
Shh.

340
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,123
Should I call somebody?

341
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:50,959
Not unless they got a spare heart.

342
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,630
Shh.

343
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,843
Oh, it's a small one. It's a teeny one.

344
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,845
Breathe it out.

345
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,431
- What do you need? Some water?
- I'll be all right.

346
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,309
Oh, I know what I want.

347
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,645
I know what I want.

348
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:15,150
Be a good boy and get me a light.
Right there.

349
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,166
What are you doing?

350
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:35,838
Courage wants to laugh.

351
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,425
He makes the snap,
looks right, he throws.

352
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,302
Phillips in for the touchdown!

353
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:47,891
...clearly in the defense
that does not give up the big plays.

354
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:53,021
...23 over West Virginia.
Pittsburgh on a 47-yard field goal

355
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,898
leads Virginia 10-7.

356
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:57,526
North Carolina and Florida are scoreless.

357
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:02,406
25th ranked Kansas trails Mississippi 7-3.
We'll be back with more scores...

358
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,909
Back to the one-yard line...

359
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,496
...and it will go against Utah again.

360
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,541
With time-out on the field,
let's go to our studios in New York

361
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,793
for an update on today's college football.

362
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,964
- Brandon!

363
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,966
How we doing?

364
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,302
Down here.

365
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,598
...while Michigan
just put the hammer to Illinois. 44-12.

366
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,976
Florida - no problem
beating North Carolina 42 to 7,

367
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,062
while Northern Washington
upset Iowa State 28-21.

368
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:38,108
Pennsylvania
manhandled Kentucky 31 to 3.

369
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,235
Bullshit!

370
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,696
...with a 17-7 win at Idaho.

371
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,699
And this just in. Arizona is hot.

372
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,577
All right! All right!

373
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,122
This guy is a machine. I mean, he...

374
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:56,126
All he does is work out and pick winners.

375
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,422
Talk about fit.
You should see him with his shirt off.

376
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:04,092
Really. I did. A serious side of beef.

377
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:07,262
Enjoy your daughter's birthday. Come on.

378
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,892
What do you mean?
You should check him out.

379
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,269
- I know you want to.
- Walter.

380
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:16,980
Get out of your head.
It's a bad neighborhood.

381
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:19,858
- Touchdown!

382
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,915
I'm gonna have the bruchetta here,
and this right here.

383
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,293
Very good.
And may I say, sir, an excellent choice.

384
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:42,881
I think it's pronounced "bruschetta."
"Bruschetta."

385
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,926
They're little pizzas,
but they don't have cheese in them.

386
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,262
- Bruschetta?
- Perfect.

387
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:53,892
Who cares? Anyone who goes 20 for 24
college football, 12 for 14 professional,

388
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:59,231
175 calls on the 900 number, you can
call bruschetta anything you want, son.

389
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,650
Ever have
a thousand-dollar bottle of wine?

390
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,318
- No.
- Steward!

391
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:07,573
- Walter, it's a waste. He hardly drinks.
- It's a celebration. Steward.

392
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,449
- Walter, it's...
- Toni, come on.

393
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:13,161
Just 'cause he's with reformed drunks
doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.

394
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:16,164
I was a lot of things, Walter,
I was never a drunk.

395
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:18,417
Actually, truth be told,

396
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,004
I've never had
a 12-dollar bottle of water either.

397
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,715
- He thinks we're fighting.
- Yeah.

398
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,888
No, I don't. Look, hey, this is great,
all of this. Thank you, Walter, Toni.

399
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,599
Watch out, Walter. He's a fixer.

400
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:38,103
- I should've ordered two.
- What did the doctor say? Come on.

401
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:42,357
Well, if you really want to know - I've been
meaning to tell you - I went yesterday,

402
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,610
and he seemed very concerned.

403
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:48,488
Afterwards, he sat me down
and looked into my eyes, and he said:

404
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:51,200
"Walter...

405
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:54,077
"who do you like
in the Buffalo-Oakland game?"

406
00:24:56,413 --> 00:25:01,084
- You tell him Buffalo?
- Shit, Walter. It wasn't funny.

407
00:25:01,168 --> 00:25:05,672
You didn't know I was joking?
It's a joke. Jokes are funny.

408
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:12,679
Wow, what a meal.
You haven't touched your sauce.

409
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,349
It's chocolate. I hear it's good for you.

410
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:19,311
- I'm not raising a kid alone, Walter.
- Come on, don't be dramatic, Toni.

411
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,690
In biblical times, you'd just move in
with my brother Morty, anyway.

412
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,737
Oh, look at that.

413
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:31,907
Beauty and the beasts.
What do you think?

414
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,910
I like her, man.
I think she's extremely cute.

415
00:25:34,952 --> 00:25:37,829
Brandon, she's looking at you.

416
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,749
Yeah, but so are
those two guys she's with.

417
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:46,755
I tell you what. I'll bet you ten to one
on a thousand you can't pick her up.

418
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:50,259
That's 10,000 cash
if you leave this restaurant with that girl.

419
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,429
I have a better idea. Why don't we go to
Atlantic City and open a house account?

420
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,265
You know you can't gamble. Come on.

421
00:25:56,306 --> 00:26:01,562
Who's gambling? I haven't flipped a coin
since the '80s. This is just a challenge.

422
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,772
A challenge?

423
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:06,483
10,000... to one.

424
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:09,278
- Cash?
- Mm-hm.

425
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:12,364
What are you gonna do?

426
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,450
- I'm gonna introduce myself.
- Before...

427
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,286
Before you make your move, sit.

428
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,872
- Where are you going?
- No problem. Don't worry.

429
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:22,291
You sit here and rest your little self.

430
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:27,171
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt
or anything, but I just gotta know this.

431
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:30,465
We're sitting over there
with my friends and I'm thinking...

432
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,594
You are drop-dead gorgeous,
and we just want to know...

433
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:37,514
Your dates look like they haven't
missed a meal since Christ died.

434
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:41,143
Seriously, you're eating
like you got a date with the electric chair.

435
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,478
What is going on? No, no, no.

436
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,814
It's all over. Sit, sit, sit.

437
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,858
Just joking. Sorry.

438
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,320
- I don't want to get wounded with a fork.
- Jerk. Moron.

439
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:55,657
- I'm gone. Thank you very much.
- What the hell was that?

440
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,701
- I went too far.
- Oh, yeah.

441
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:01,788
- I'll buy them a bottle of champagne.
- You'll pick up their check.

442
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:04,082
The voice of reason.

443
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:07,252
Thank you. Uh-oh.

444
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:10,672
Your date's going to the bathroom.

445
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,804
I don't think that
helped me out too much, do you?

446
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,847
Well...

447
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:22,017
But, hey, thanks for the introduction.

448
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:24,937
Hey, I was just raising the bar a little.

449
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,689
John Anthony could close her.

450
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:35,697
You are beautiful.

451
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:38,867
- Excuse me.
- Hang on a second.

452
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:42,538
I want to get to know you.

453
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,832
You just want to get in my pants.

454
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:51,004
No. No, no, no, no, no. I want to get
in your mind and your heart and your soul,

455
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:55,384
and I don't see you
wearing any pants in that equation.

456
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,138
Do you?

457
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,184
Let me ask you something.

458
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,602
OK, forget the 900 numbers.
Now you're ready.

459
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,313
We're moving up.
We're going to the second floor.

460
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:53,609
This is where we print the money.
Put your ear to the door.

461
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,485
Wow.

462
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,739
That's the sound of possibilities.

463
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:02,242
This is it. This is where
the sales people turn a ten-dollar bettor

464
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,495
into a 1,000-dollar bettor
before he knows he made the call.

465
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:08,957
I'm asking do they use
Astroturf or AstroPlay?

466
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,668
Tammy. Give it up, baby.

467
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,962
- You know what I need.
- Sure do.

468
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,673
- Tammy, this is Brandon.
- How are you, Tammy?

469
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:20,219
OK, this is our phone sheet.
The losers who need us.

470
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:22,221
The more they bet, the more we win.

471
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,683
We take 10% of a winning bet
anywhere from 500 to 500,000.

472
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:30,687
- That's Southie.
- Let's make some serious money.

473
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,273
- What's the game plan?
- You know what?

474
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:37,402
You're a private security guard.
Bang a cheerleader, extract the information.

475
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:42,533
Well, it was a substantial sum.
Walter, he's a little miffed at our picks.

476
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,117
Just do what you got to do.

477
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,496
It says right here
that the minimum bet is five grand.

478
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,167
Reggie Hawks. Best salesman ever. Ever.

479
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:55,671
I don't have time for this kind of shit,
Jimmy. I know you're a loser.

480
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,340
If you were a big winner,
you wouldn't pay to call me.

481
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:02,302
You got your head
outta your ass yet?

482
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,639
Is this my office?

483
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:09,977
- Well, do you like it?
- What's not to like, Walter? Thank you.

484
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,647
Miami New York point spread
just went up to ten.

485
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,151
- What do you think?
- Miami is a lock. Are you kidding me?

486
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:22,698
This is Jerry, my top handicapper.
Came to me straight out of grad school.

487
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:26,076
Whoa. Phone boy makes good, huh?
It's a big jump from 900 numbers.

488
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,705
Make sure you don't get
a nosebleed up here. I'm just kidding.

489
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,958
- Nice meeting you. Gotta get to work.
- Nice meeting you too.

490
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,420
Say, by the way, tonight's game...

491
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,881
New York wins that outright.

492
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:40,257
Really?

493
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,468
They always play the Fish tough
and tonight it's foregone.

494
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:47,890
I wish I had a pen because I would
never write that down. You know...

495
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,517
college is right for you.

496
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,770
You have to work your way up
to pro ball around here. Good luck.

497
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:57,608
Rookie's got balls.
I almost like it, but I don't. Good luck.

498
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,276
I get that all day.

499
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,072
You know, I got three guys who can
pick games, I got 20 who can sell.

500
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:06,617
I never had one who could do both.

501
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,536
- What? You mean me?
- No, not you.

502
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,496
I'm talking about John Anthony.

503
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,458
John Anthony doesn't exist.

504
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,251
Oh? Well, I'm shocked,

505
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:20,589
because I'm standing in his office
and you're sitting in his chair.

506
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,258
So you want me to sell.

507
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,512
- Like those guys out there?
- Yes.

508
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:30,724
Big bettors don't want middlemen.
They want the guy giving them the picks.

509
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,602
- You got a problem with selling?
- No. I don't have a...

510
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,771
There's a few choice phrases we use here.

511
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,524
You just start with those.
Now, here's an easy one.

512
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:42,069
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's fucking money.

513
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,239
Give it back to me.

514
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,908
I don't want your money.

515
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,743
I want your bookie's money.

516
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:53,205
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's money.

517
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,207
That's not bad.

518
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,751
- What happened to "fuck"?
- What about it?

519
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,420
- I said it. You don't use it?
- Nah.

520
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:04,091
- Really? A religious thing?
- No, it's not a religious thing. I just...

521
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:07,386
It was all right for Chaucer 600 years ago.

522
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:11,306
Hey! I don't want to embarrass you,
but I gotta do this.

523
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,351
I got someone here
who has a problem saying "fuck."

524
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:17,312
- Hold on.
- Fuck you!

525
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:22,943
Look at that.
A lot of brunettes.

526
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:24,778
Where are we headed?

527
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,322
We're gonna continue your education.

528
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,495
- Hi. Is this the meeting?
- Yes, yes. Come on in. Hi.

529
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:39,209
You'd think with two mortgages out,
the repo guys staking out my car,

530
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:43,672
my job on the line, and my wife
threatening to leave, that I'd stop,

531
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,091
instead of staying in the chase,
doubling down.

532
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:48,051
It's a disease, Leon.

533
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:51,847
Yeah, man. Look, admitting
you have a problem is the first step.

534
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,432
Yeah.

535
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:57,978
I guess I must be doing pretty good
because I've got one big problem.

536
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,981
- Don't worry about it, Leon.
- It's OK, Leon.

537
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,817
- Hang in there, Leon.
- Hey.

538
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:06,320
My name is Walter
and I'm new to this group...

539
00:33:06,403 --> 00:33:07,529
Hey, Walter.

540
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:11,366
...but I am not new to these meetings.
I've been coming 18 years now.

541
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:15,746
As a matter of fact, friends,
this is my 936th consecutive meeting.

542
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:18,582
- Hey, man, well done.

543
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:21,543
Well done is right.

544
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:27,424
And in all that time I haven't once been
to a track or a casino or bet on a game.

545
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,760
Hand to God, not a cent.

546
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:33,138
So I know where you're coming from, Leon.

547
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:37,226
Believe me, I know. I heard your story,
and it's something I relate to,

548
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,189
but I gotta say, if I learned anything,
it's that gambling is not your problem.

549
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,024
- It's not?
- Not even close.

550
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:49,738
I don't know how to say this without
sounding rude, but you're a lemon, Leon.

551
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:54,326
Like a bad car, there is something
inherently defective in you.

552
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,288
And you. And you. And me.
And all of us in this room.

553
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:01,875
We're all lemons.
We look like everybody else,

554
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:06,046
but what makes us different is our defect.

555
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:09,925
You see, most gamblers,
when they go to gamble, they go to win.

556
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:13,470
When we go to gamble,
we go to lose, subconsciously.

557
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:18,684
Me, I never feel better, or more alive,
than when they're raking the chips away,

558
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:22,020
not bringing them in, and everybody
knows what I'm talking about.

559
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:26,149
Hell, even when we win, it's just
a matter of time before we give it all back.

560
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:29,361
But when we lose,
now, there's another story, when we lose.

561
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,613
I'm talking about the kind of loss

562
00:34:31,697 --> 00:34:34,992
that makes your asshole pucker up
to the size of a decimal point.

563
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:39,705
You know what I mean? You've just
recreated the worst possible nightmare

564
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:43,876
this side of malignant cancer
for the 20th goddamn time,

565
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:46,712
and you're standing there
and you suddenly realize:

566
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:50,174
"Hey, I'm still here."

567
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,884
"I'm still breathing."

568
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:54,094
"I'm still alive."

569
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:57,014
Us lemons, we fuck shit up
all the time on purpose,

570
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,726
because we constantly
need to remind ourselves we're alive.

571
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:03,729
Leon, gambling's not your problem.

572
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:06,481
It's this fucked-up need

573
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,317
to feel something,

574
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,153
to convince yourself you exist.

575
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,490
That's the problem.

576
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:28,462
Hey, you're the guy I see on TV
every weekend selling betting picks.

577
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,215
- So what?
- Oh, yeah, he's right. This guy...

578
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,509
This guy peddles a tout service on TV.

579
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,595
You read the charter, buddy?
We all left our jobs at the door.

580
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:40,557
Are you gonna throw an ex-alcoholic
bartender out of an AA meeting?

581
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,018
- What?
- You're gonna do that? That's bogus.

582
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,771
- Hey, didn't you come in with this jerk?
- Come on.

583
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,940
I don't like the feeling I'm getting.

584
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,901
If you rethink things, here's my card.

585
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:53,946
We're topping 80% this season.
Put it in your wallet.

586
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,865
- You never know when you'll relapse.
- Get out!

587
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,161
What the fuck was that?

588
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:04,873
- What did you just say?
- That was bullshit.

589
00:36:04,915 --> 00:36:08,168
- You gave your business card...
- No, no. You said fuck.

590
00:36:08,252 --> 00:36:12,506
- So what?
- Brandon. So what? That's great, man.

591
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,050
It was all worth it just from that one word.

592
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:20,264
From the one word fuck, I could feel
your frustration, I could feel your anger.

593
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,723
Man, I'm proud of you.

594
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,694
His name is Amir.

595
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:35,320
He's a dime bettor.

596
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:36,613
Owns a dry cleaners.

597
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:40,033
- We got him for the subscription.
- Amir...

598
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:43,537
He's on line one. Mm, ding, ding.

599
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,587
Mm.

600
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,130
Good morning.

601
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:56,133
Walter wanted
your first call to be special.

602
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,011
- OK. Go get 'em, tiger.
- You got it.

603
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:02,681
Me-me-me-me-ow-ow-ow!

604
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,308
Mm-hm.

605
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:07,603
- Amir, my man. John Anthony here.
- Yes. Hello.

606
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:10,022
Yes, hello to you, sir.
How's your morning?

607
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:14,776
Mine started off outstanding.
Not as outstanding as I plan my weekend being.

608
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,446
Billy, listen.
Thanks for the $15,000 FedEx.

609
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:20,449
It's called a three-team parlay.
It pays six to one.

610
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,868
How much can you lay? 20 grand?

611
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,912
Are you crazy?

612
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:28,498
No way. Listen,
I was betting a thousand a game.

613
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:32,920
I've got a game that I'm calling
my lock of the decade, OK? Texas v OU.

614
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,672
Now, Texas is receiving
six points in this game.

615
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:39,259
- They're gonna win it by two touchdowns.
- Really?

616
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:42,137
- I like Oklahoma in that game.
- You do?

617
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:44,681
I shouldn't have called.
Thank you for your time.

618
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,725
Hold on. I've got Vegas on the line.

619
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:51,438
When we get our 30 grand from last night,
then I tell you who he likes next week.

620
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:55,776
The only thing you gotta know about any
of our clients is that they're all in a hole.

621
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,320
The second they pick up the phone,
you got 'em.

622
00:37:58,362 --> 00:38:02,241
I'll tell you once. Green Bay, Dallas,
Cleveland. 100,000 across the board.

623
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,661
Get to the point, you're above them.

624
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:09,498
Let 'em know it. Let 'em feel it.
More John Anthony.

625
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,416
Amir.

626
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,379
- What's your favorite drink, my man?
- Favorite drink?

627
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,339
I don't know.

628
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:19,132
- Piña colada.
- Whoa.

629
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:25,138
Tomorrow, we gotta get you a new drink,
but today, here's what you're gonna do.

630
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:28,308
You're gonna go down to your bookie
and lay 20 large on Texas.

631
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:31,520
Then you'll go home,
put on your favorite Hawaiian shirt,

632
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,147
and you'll sit back,
twirl your little umbrella

633
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:39,361
after you've made that rum concoction
with the orange slice and the cherry,

634
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:42,364
and you'll watch Texas
rip those Okies a new asshole.

635
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:45,868
And after you win the 20 grand,
you're gonna call me back

636
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:49,162
and you're gonna tell me,
"Thank you, sir. May I have another?"

637
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:53,417
McNeil lost his dog last week
to a hunting accident.

638
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,420
You don't mess with a man
who just lost his dog.

639
00:38:56,503 --> 00:38:59,840
Western Union me ten thou
and let's ride this wave into Sunday.

640
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:03,093
Denny, boy!
I've got something good for this weekend.

641
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:07,181
Green Bay against Minnesota. I want
you to lay $500 on the Cheeseheads.

642
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:10,475
Let Stu in on that too,
and take care of Mama. Talk to you later.

643
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,727
Tammy, who's on four?

644
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,062
Forget the other games you wanted to bet.

645
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:17,608
Let's throw that 4,000 on this 1,000
and make it five,

646
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:20,152
take it money line and turn it into 12,000.

647
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,237
John Anthony here.

648
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:26,825
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to "Football Tonight."

649
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:30,996
...ten-yard
line, he passes and that's a blind throw...

650
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,040
He's in the end zone!

651
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:36,001
- Touchdown!
- Yes!

652
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,881
Good ball game.
10-7. Oakland upsets New York.

653
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:56,313
OK. No, that sounds good.
Actually, you know what? Monday...

654
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,982
Go, Daddy, go! Can't you go any faster?

655
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,902
Hey! Ten and two, pro football?

656
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:05,489
85% weekend. You're a mutant!

657
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:08,408
I definitely want to be there with him.
Put it on a plate.

658
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:13,288
Oh, my God. Thank you. You saved my life.
That is beautiful.

659
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,124
What... What's going on?

660
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:20,337
Walter's doctor - this is good news -
finally put him on an exercise program.

661
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,005
I want to be there the first time

662
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:26,385
to make sure the trainer understands
his aversion to consistency. Excuse me.

663
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:28,720
- Aversion to consistency?
- Mm-hm.

664
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,765
That's Walter. He's always been that way.

665
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:36,562
- Well, that's consistent.
- Well, that's true.

666
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,773
You are cute. Take a bite.
Tell me what you think.

667
00:40:39,857 --> 00:40:42,359
Life is fucking good.

668
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:47,322
So... let's talk about making it better.

669
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:50,158
Uh-oh. Duck, Brandon. Here it comes.

670
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:56,081
I'm thinking of putting
John Anthony on TV this week.

671
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,500
If you do this, from here on out,

672
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:01,336
you're gonna have to eat, sleep,

673
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,172
drink, breathe,

674
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:07,009
talk, walk and fart John Anthony.

675
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:10,095
That's the way it is.
There's no holding back.

676
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:13,265
You gotta be it,
completely, or it doesn't work.

677
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:18,020
That's right, and just think it over.
Don't decide now.

678
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:21,273
It's the only move.
If it means I've gotta act, that's cool.

679
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:24,735
No. No acting. This is living.

680
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:27,779
You didn't hear me.

681
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:30,032
From here on out,

682
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:33,076
Brandon Lang and his fettuccine knee,

683
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,874
and his self-fucking-pity,
is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair.

684
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:44,880
And John "I Can Walk On Fucking Water"
Anthony has taken his place.

685
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:47,633
Now, listen
to what he's asking you, Brandon.

686
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,302
I'm gonna build an empire around you.

687
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:53,722
It's gonna cost me.

688
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:59,436
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Hell, yeah, I understand.

689
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,440

I want you to meet him, a substantial find,

OK, we're entering week six
in professional football.

736
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,796
This is when the cream rises to the top.
This is when things get hot.

00:44:30,879 --> 00:44:34,716
This is oven-mitt time. Am I right?
This is big-time ball season.

So let's get right into it with the wizard

00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:05,247
enough Viagra
to make Chuck's head blow off,

747
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,541
than picking these things on your own.

748
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:11,712
You call me absolutely free. I got five
picks this weekend that are incredible.

749
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:15,340
1-800-238-6648. Give me a call.

750
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:19,636
How many gamblers did I bail out
last weekend with my game of the year?

751
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,431
A 100-dollar bettor made $10,000.

752
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:26,435
A 500-dollar bettor made $50,000.

753
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:30,522
Well, I got six games on Sunday
that I'm releasing absolutely free.

754
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:34,568
These games are a burial,
a blowout, a human lock.

755
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:40,616
You can bet your children's unborn
children's children on these six games

756
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,036
absolutely free!

757
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:46,205
Whoa, whoa, I believe, I believe!

758
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:49,249
I believe you're trying to make me deaf.

759
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:53,670
I've never seen a color on a man like that.
Would you say that's chartreuse?

760
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:59,218
So Saturday comes before Sunday, and
looking at Saturday's college match-ups

761
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:02,846
is the last, but certainly not least,
member of the sports advisors.

762
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,725
- And here he is, Mr. John Anthony.
- Thank you, Walter.

763
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:11,563
This is John Anthony, the million-dollar
man with the billion-dollar plan.

764
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:13,482
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood,

765
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:16,360
all your big money
is gonna stay and play with me.

766
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:20,364
That's right. That's why
they call me the million-dollar man.

767
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:24,535
The million-dollar man, the million-dollar
man, the million-dollar man.

768
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:27,079
I can't say that, man.

769
00:46:28,288 --> 00:46:31,166
- Uh...
- No, no.

770
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,170
Somebody wrote
some very clever stuff for me here,

771
00:46:35,212 --> 00:46:37,589
like the million-dollar man.

772
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,592
So let's just call me John.

773
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:43,846
I played quarterback, division one.

774
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:50,143
Every QB knows that the secret,
the key, to victory is anticipation.

775
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:53,063
The ability to see the future and react to it.

776
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:54,940
Now, that is what I do.

777
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:56,900
And that is the truth.

778
00:46:56,984 --> 00:47:01,947
So I'm not gonna sell you today, all right?
I'm just gonna tell you the facts.

779
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,157
For over one year,

780
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:07,870
I have been picking 80% winners.

781
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,289
Unbelievable?

782
00:47:10,372 --> 00:47:12,040
Used to be.

783
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:14,835
I know the leagues. I know the teams.

784
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:19,047
I know these players.
I know this wonderful game called football.

785
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:22,176
Call the number
on the bottom of your screen,

786
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,344
and ask for John.

787
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:26,930
Let's make some money.

788
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,164
Walter.

789
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:57,085
- I'm not here. Go back to sleep.
- Walter, it's four in the morning, honey.

790
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,087
What a show.

791
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:01,590
Come to bed.

792
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,926
Man, you should have seen him.

793
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:07,262
I just sat there and watched him roll.

794
00:48:07,346 --> 00:48:10,599
I swear he made me
want to pick up a phone and call.

795
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:14,895
I took the sales boys down the Smith and Wo's
to get them primed for the weekend,

796
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:21,944
and Chuck got so drunk he took a swing
at one of the deer heads on the wall.

797
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:25,280
I don't know what we're gonna do.
I'll hire more guys on Monday.

798
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,783
I got to. I gotta get more phones.

799
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,410
- Everything's amping up.
- Yeah?

800
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,663
This guy, I'm telling you,

801
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:36,708
I'm gonna do this whole dot-com thing
around him, you know?

802
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:40,879
I swear, if I had me when I was his age...

803
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:43,257
you know, I never had a mentor.

804
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,884
Now I got a protégé. You know?

805
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:49,179
Someone you hand it all down to.

806
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:52,724
If anything happens to me, he steps in.

807
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:55,310
He steps in.

808
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:58,146
Just knowing that,
with this thing, you know.

809
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,692
- It's like having a son.
- Walter, come here.

810
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:05,279
It's beautiful. It's beautiful, beautiful.

811
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:09,408
- You gotta go back to sleep.
- What are you doing?

812
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:13,412
- I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go for a run.
- No. Walter...

813
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,790
- See the sunrise.
- Come here. Just for a second.

814
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,500
Come here. You're exhausted.

815
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:24,256
No, I'm not. I wanna go do the bridge
thing, you know, up-up-up Fifth?

816
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:29,219
Walter, I haven't seen you all day.
Just come to bed for one minute.

817
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:32,973
Just for a minute, 'cause, you know,
I've got the trainer tomorrow.

818
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:36,018
- The trainer wants me to run.
- I know, baby.

819
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,354
- He wants me to run in place, you know?
- I know, honey.

820
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:41,857
Run from one place to another place.

821
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:46,695
No time to sleep, just because you're so
exhausted, I mean, that's no time to sleep.

822
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,531
You're right. No time for sleep.

823
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,826
I'll be right here
when you get back from your run.

824
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,453
That's nice of you.

825
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:58,624
- I'll be right here right beside you, Walter.
- Oh, that's nice of you.

826
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:01,168
I'm not going anywhere.

827
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,545
It's OK.

828
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:08,592
Just close your eyes
for one second before you go, OK?

829
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:14,890
Know about Stokey
being out against New York?

830
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:18,519
- A knock would be nice, Jerry.
- I'm kinda underwater here, man.

831
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,939
- A yes or no would be great.
- No, I don't.

832
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,734
If you know something, or if you
hear anything, you gotta let me know,

833
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:27,861
'cause that's the way we work.

834
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:30,781
I'll rush right over, stat.

835
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,534
I've been here six years.
You've been here one.

836
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:38,288
What are you doing in here?
Hit the phones, man. Do some damage control.

837
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:40,499
Rewrite that friggin' computer program.

838
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:43,210
- Hey, it was a fucked weekend.
- For some people.

839
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:46,421
There's a 50-dime bettor
who wants to talk to John Anthony.

840
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:50,300
- What's his name?
- Carl. He owns McDonald's franchises.

841
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:53,178
Wait a minute.
I landed that lead. He's my guy.

842
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:55,013
- Was.
- He's raiding my list now?

843
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:58,934
Your clients are jumping ship,
you lactose-intolerant fuck. Get out.

844
00:50:58,976 --> 00:51:00,686
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

845
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:05,065
We're home! We're home!
We're home! We're home!

846
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:11,280
- Can we play princess?
- Oh, yes, can we play princess.

847
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:14,157
You go get in your princess outfit.
Everything, OK?

848
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,994
I'll put the groceries away,
then I'll come and play.

849
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:19,830
- OK!
- You go ahead.

850
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:22,416
You got it made. You gotta admit that.

851
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,961
I got a little cab fare.

852
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,631
That... that won't hurt. Hey, baby.

853
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:32,885
I can explain this. It's...

854
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:36,054
- Gail, that's my wife, Toni.
- Hi.

855
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,724
- Thank you.
- It's OK, really.

856
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:43,520
- Walter, I'll talk to you later, OK? Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

857
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,606
What the hell's going on here, Walter?

858
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:49,193
You don't seriously think
I had something to do with that girl, now?

859
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:53,363
I just brought her up here to pay her off.
I got her for John. Come on.

860
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,532
- Don't bullshit me, Walter.
- Oh, no.

861
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:58,952
You can't be serious.
You think I slept with this girl?

862
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:02,581
- Who the hell's John? Who's John?
- John. John Anthony. Ring a bell?

863
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,583
You got Brandon a hooker?

864
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:10,297
He's working late, he's in a new city,
he has no friends. Yes, I got him a hooker.

865
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,633
Are we gonna have this conversation?

866
00:52:12,716 --> 00:52:16,011
Are you completely,
completely clueless, Walter?

867
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:18,639
- Why are you so angry?
- Why am I so angry?

868
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:22,768
Look at you.
You're jealous. Look at you.

869
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:27,940
- Oh, God. Jealous of what? Of what?
- I don't know. Brandon getting laid.

870
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:31,860
You really are crazy.
'Cause that sick thought never entered my mind.

871
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:35,072
Oh, that's not where those thoughts enter.

872
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,366
OK, I'm done. I'm done. That's it.

873
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:42,913
You'll be happy to know, he didn't
sleep with her. I just paid her for coming.

874
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:45,415
- Pardon the pun.
- Oh, you're hysterical.

875
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:47,459
- Daddy!
- Oh!

876
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:49,294
- Daddy!
- Where's my baby?

877
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:51,338
Look at her! Look at her! Look at her!

878
00:52:52,089 --> 00:52:57,219
Coming up, week-seven predictions
with our new star John Anthony,

879
00:52:57,302 --> 00:53:01,348
who went an amazing 24 and six
in last weekend's games.

880
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,184
- Jerry.
- Yeah.

881
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,687
John's up first tonight.

882
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:11,108
- What?
- John Anthony is leading off tonight.

883
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:14,528
- John Anthony's leading off?
- Is there an echo in here?

884
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:17,865
Engineer! Sound!
Help me, I'm hearing everything twice.

885
00:53:17,948 --> 00:53:21,702
Two years I lead off and you bury me
in the deck over a couple lousy weekends?

886
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:24,955
- This is bullshit, Walter.
- ...three, two...

887
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:28,000
Welcome to week seven.

888
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,544
- I'm in the garage.
- Hook it up?

889
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:33,213
- Yeah. You wanna hear it?
- Man, let me hear it.

890
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:36,091
- OK.

891
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:43,765
- It is the bomb.
- Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

892
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:46,351
That's what I'm talking about, my man.

893
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:48,896
I'm about to head out.
Everything else cool?

894
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:51,398
Yeah, sort of. Did Dad reach you?

895
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:55,777
- Dad? No. Why?
- Must be out of money. He keeps calling.

896
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:57,654
He saw you on TV and wants to talk.

897
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:01,241
I gave him your work number, but
he says they won't put him through.

898
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,827
I don't know what that's about.
I'll check into it.

899
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,538
Let's walk.
You could use the exercise.

900
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:09,875
Stop worrying. We're set for life.
We got Jimmy the Greek here.

901
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:16,048
He makes Nostra-fucking-damus look like
a novelty act. Brandon, to the right.

902
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:17,758
You love that, don't you?

903
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:20,719
- Let me ask you a question, Walter.
- Shoot.

904
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:23,972
Have you been blocking any of my calls?

905
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:27,809
Of course. You don't need
distractions right now, my boy.

906
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:31,813
- Lot of crazies out there.
- Does that include my father?

907
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:36,527
You're asking me,
I'm gonna tell you. Yeah.

908
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:38,737
You son of a bitch.

909
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,324
How long?

910
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,159
- About two weeks.
- Walter.

911
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:48,330
Come on. Brandon, would you
have taken the call if I put it through?

912
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:52,000
That's not the point. That's not the point.

913
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:56,463
What is the point? I'd like to know.
What's the story with you and your father?

914
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,591
- You tell me. You seem to know.
- Well, I know pieces.

915
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:01,802
That's about all.

916
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:06,056
- Hey, man, I was just trying to spare you.
- Who are you gonna spare me from, huh?

917
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:09,476
He was a drunk, left when I was nine.
I couldn't compete with the bottle.

918
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,271
End of fucking story.
So you won't spare me nothing.

919
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:16,942
If I want to talk to him, I will.
Spare me. You fuck.

920
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,319
Is that it? Is that all you got?

921
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:24,908
I will match my dysfunctional childhood
and Toni's against yours any day.

922
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:29,830
My father - five foot, arms like this.
He had a cock like a Hebrew National.

923
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:34,209
If I even looked at him the wrong way
he'd smack me like Jake LaMotta.

924
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:38,088
By the time I was five, he yelled at me
so much I thought my name was asshole.

925
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:40,048
Broke my nose three times.

926
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,426
Toni, tell him about you. Come on.

927
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:45,888
- I didn't have a great childhood either.
- Great?

928
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,432
Tell him about the uncle.

929
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,267
Well, I think he gets the idea now.

930
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:54,479
Come on. Suffice it to say, she was
abused by everybody but the family pet.

931
00:55:54,563 --> 00:55:56,273
OK, Walter, please.

932
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,860
Your father was a drunk.
He was a jerk. So what?

933
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:03,530
It happens. I'm glad
I blocked those calls. You know why?

934
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:06,408
You need a new image of a man.
How about me?

935
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:12,706
- She's laughing.
- Cause that's a scary fucking thought.

936
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:14,583
Hey, Brandon, listen to me, man.

937
00:56:14,625 --> 00:56:18,212
The shit that happened to you,
to me, to Toni, you know what that is?

938
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,380
It's just that, shit that happened,

939
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,884
because after the therapy
and the psychiatry

940
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,637
and the meetings,
you know what it all comes down to?

941
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,889
We're all fucked up.

942
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:31,433
We are all just so fucked up.

943
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,019
Now, you gotta just say that shit out.

944
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,897
"I am fucked up
and I ain't gonna take it anymore."

945
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,692
Come on. You too, Toni. Let's do it.
All of us. Wallow with me here a minute.

946
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:44,488
We are so fucked up,
we're not gonna take it anymore.

947
00:56:44,571 --> 00:56:48,075
I am so fucked up with all of you

948
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,410
that I'm not gonna take it anymore.

949
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,954
How's that?

950
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:55,332
Hey! I'm trying to sleep here, asshole.

951
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,501
- That you, Dad?
- OK, Walter.

952
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,503
I'm gonna kick your fucking head in.

953
00:56:59,586 --> 00:57:01,755
- Let's go.
- Don't wait up.

954
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:05,592
Amir, you've got to be kidding me, huh?

955
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:10,556
Are you gonna haggle over 50 grand
after the 250,000 I just made you last weekend?

956
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,102
Look, don't get me wrong, John.
50,000 seems slightly steep.

957
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:18,313
Steep. Amir, let's rewind a second.

958
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:22,734
First time you call... No cuff.
...you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon,

959
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:25,195
crying about having
to hock your fiancée's ring.

960
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:29,658
Now, today, you're calling me from
a red, convertible F1 Ferrari, isn't that it?

961
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,619
Right? Candy red?
Yeah, you doing the math?

962
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,663
I am. All right? I'm gonna cut you off.

963
00:57:34,705 --> 00:57:36,999
- Oh, come on, John.
- I'm coming on.

964
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:40,544
If we keep working together,
I'll charge a 10% aggravation tax.

965
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,629
Get your ass to Western Union tonight.

966
00:57:42,713 --> 00:57:45,465
Wire me 75 grand
and maybe we can kiss and make up.

967
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:47,801
OK, OK, John. Now, let's...

968
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:49,761
John Anthony. Talk to me.

969
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:52,806
- May I please speak to Brandon Lang?
- Mom?

970
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,602
- Hey, honey, is that you?
- Yeah, it's me!

971
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:59,438
- Are you OK?
- Mom, I have never been better.

972
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:02,024
I'm kicking ass and taking names.

973
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:05,485
- Did you get the money that I sent you?
- Yeah. That's why I'm...

974
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:09,239
I talked to Denny. I'm flying you and him
out here next month, first-class.

975
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:12,242
I'll put you up at the Plaza.
You'll meet Toni and Walter.

976
00:58:12,326 --> 00:58:14,161
You are gonna love this joint, Ma.

977
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:19,625
That sounds great, honey.
About the money, all that money, it's- it's too much.

978
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:22,085
Ma, but it-it-it's not too much!

979
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,506
I made that money. I earned that money,
every fucking cent of it.

980
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:29,218
- Listen to you.
- Ma, it's just how people talk out here.

981
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:31,220
Look, no cuff.

982
00:58:31,303 --> 00:58:33,514
No cuff, Francesco.

983
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:36,016
Now, who's this John Anthony person?

984
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:40,103
Those checks I've been sending you,
those checks you've been cashing,

985
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:41,855
those are from John Anthony.

986
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:45,108
- And he talks like that?
- Mom, they are from me.

987
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:47,861
- We gotta go to Puerto Rico.
- I gotta put you on hold.

988
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:50,364
- What's in Puerto Rico?
- CM Novian called.

989
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:54,618
He lives in Puerto Rico.
He's the biggest sports bettor in the world.

990
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:59,206
We've hit the jackpot. He wants to sit
and talk, in person, with John Anthony.

991
00:58:59,289 --> 00:59:02,709
- Got it. How much time we got?
- 45 minutes plane leaves La Guardia.

992
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,045
Whoa, pronto, OK. Mama?

993
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,714
Mom? Ma?

994
00:59:10,467 --> 00:59:13,011
My mom just hung up on me. Um...

995
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:20,561
- What do you know about him?
- Not much, but he's a world-class prick.

996
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:24,231
Wouldn't return my call. Treated me
worse than my Hong Kong tailor.

997
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:26,942
You know how long
I've been trying to bag this guy?

998
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:29,278
Have you any idea
what this thing is worth?

999
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:32,072
Nope, but I want a bonus
if we pull this off.

1000
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:35,576
- No "if." It's only "when."
- I got you.

1001
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:38,495
You understand?
Remember, he called us.

1002
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,998
- You hooked him.
- Mm-hm.

1003
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:44,084
- Know that. Sweat that.
- You got it.

1004
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:48,630
Relax, my man.
I'll get in character in the car, huh?

1005
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:50,591
Oh, fuck!

1006
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:54,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1007
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,848
Hey! Uh-oh. Easy, baby. Easy, easy.

1008
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:01,894
Is it your heart?
Where's your vial? Easy, easy.

1009
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:05,564
Somebody get a doctor! Get me a doctor,
and get me some water now.

1010
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,483
Here we are. Hang on, baby.
Yeah, breathe it out.

1011
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:12,738
Here's one, two. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you suck on them. Suck on them, man.

1012
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:14,907
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1013
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:17,242
Easy, easy, easy.

1014
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:18,952
- Yeah, baby.
- Brandon?

1015
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:20,787
- Yeah? I'm here.
- You love me?

1016
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:24,917
Shh. Oh, I love you. You know I love you.
Shh. You ain't going nowhere.

1017
01:00:24,958 --> 01:00:29,379
Somebody get some help!
Get me some water now!

1018
01:00:29,463 --> 01:00:30,506
Shh.

1019
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:34,259
- Brandon?
- Yeah? Talk to me, my man. Come on.

1020
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,346
Would you love me...

1021
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,307
if this was a joke?

1022
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:42,726
I'm OK.

1023
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:46,355
I was just practicing. It's OK.

1024
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:48,565
It's OK.

1025
01:00:48,649 --> 01:00:52,736
Look at me. I'm all right. Oh, I got a crowd.

1026
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:57,032
Little indigestion.
Too many peanuts on the plane. I'm OK.

1027
01:00:57,115 --> 01:01:00,369
Thank you for your concern.
He's had a little problem. Whoa.

1028
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:03,330
Don't- don't- don't- don't you do that to me.

1029
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:07,334
- Walter, that's pushing it too far.
- Now, you listen to me.

1030
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:11,713
Now, you pay attention to me right now.
There's no such thing as too far.

1031
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:15,342
Understand?
You push everything as far as you can.

1032
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:19,054
You push and you push and you push
until it starts pushing back

1033
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,265
and then you push some goddamn more.

1034
01:01:21,348 --> 01:01:25,310
Remember that
when you're with this guy today.

1035
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:26,603
OK?

1036
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:33,360
Oh, man. If I start to die again,
forget the hospital, I wanna croak here.

1037
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:40,075
- Walter.
- Mr. Novian, it's an honor. My associate...

1038
01:01:40,158 --> 01:01:42,661
- John Anthony.
- How are you?

1039
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:45,372
These sports services of yours...

1040
01:01:45,956 --> 01:01:49,042
complete fucking scam, huh?

1041
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:56,091
I hear your boy here's having quite a season.
What's your system, Walter?

1042
01:01:56,175 --> 01:01:59,678
- System?
- Let's start with how much you bet.

1043
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:02,222
Million a game, across the board.

1044
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:05,726
OK, is that the most we're working with?

1045
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:11,190
It depends. Shit, Benny, check your wallet.
See if you have any cash.

1046
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:14,276
Maybe he'll talk about the weekend.
How do you feel about it?

1047
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:17,696
- Do you rent that yacht?
- No, no. I own it.

1048
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:20,532
Well, that's how I feel about this weekend.

1049
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:24,703
And I'm not being cocky. I'm talking
straight commerce with you, Mr. Novian.

1050
01:02:24,745 --> 01:02:29,041
- I didn't come down here to bullshit you.
- Wow, you got steamed.

1051
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:31,960
Or maybe
a little inside information, maybe?

1052
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:36,381
I know these teams
better than they know themselves.

1053
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:39,968
I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend
including the Monday-night parlay.

1054
01:02:40,052 --> 01:02:43,222
Wow. Should we believe him?

1055
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:45,557
- What do you think?
- I don't believe him.

1056
01:02:45,641 --> 01:02:47,893
You cannot afford not to.

1057
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:50,729
- No, I can afford.
- Can you?

1058
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:54,233
Honest question, Mr. Novian. Can you?

1059
01:02:54,274 --> 01:02:56,485
Hell, can anyone, for that matter,

1060
01:02:56,568 --> 01:03:00,447
afford to lose as much
as a man like you needs to bet

1061
01:03:00,531 --> 01:03:02,824
to actually feel a win?

1062
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:07,079
Winning's a funny thing.

1063
01:03:07,162 --> 01:03:12,251
It's one of those rare commodities
that money cannot buy, until you called me.

1064
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,754
I didn't call you. I called your boss.

1065
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,923
And he called me.

1066
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:23,929
The price is $250,000 up-front,
plus 10% of every game you win.

1067
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:26,682
Well, that's wild.

1068
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:31,937
I never paid up-front before, did I?

1069
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:33,856
We've never charged it before.

1070
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:38,360
Considering whose picks you're getting,
and the amount of money you're betting,

1071
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:41,280
250's a bargain. You know it and I know it.

Come in.

- They need it, Mr. Anthony.
- What's your mother's name, Mitchell?

1077
01:04:11,268 --> 01:04:12,352
Sheila.

1078
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:15,189
- What street did you grow up on?
- Atlantic Avenue.

1079
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:18,192
- Who do you like Monday night?
- Oh, I don't know.

1080
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:20,736
- Pick one.
- Well, that's your job.

1081
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:24,489
I'll do your job tomorrow.
Today you do mine. Who do you like?

1082
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:27,159
- What are you talking about?
- Mitchie.

1083

Seattle v New Orleans.
Stop stalling. Who do you like?

1084
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:38,754
I don't know. I mean,
I guess I like Seattle, plus the two points.

1085
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:42,257
- Over or under?
- No, you can't... Don't... You can't do that.

1086
01:04:42,341 --> 01:04:46,720
No, I can do this.
Over or under? It's 44 points. Come on.

01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:49,348
Um...

Seattle in the over. Nice.

1090
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,939
I won't hand that in.
A million dollars are riding on that game.

Oh, there's a whole lot more than that.

The outcome will be the same.

1093
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:10,077
- OK. And... what if I'm wrong?
- There's no "if."

1094
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:14,706
Are we running to the field goal?
We don't need a field goal.

1095
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,750
We need a touchdown.

01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:46,455
♪ "Somebody to love"

1186
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:54,922
- You know what time it is?
- It is 8:37 in the a.m.

1187
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:57,049
Wrong. It's time to press, my man.

1188
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:00,552
We're gonna yank out all the stops.
When you're winning, you press.

1189
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:04,097
You don't rest on your laurels.
What are you doing?

1190
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:08,101
I've got a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot
with a client - that Howell guy.

1191
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:10,395
So don't call me unless the lines change.

1192
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,776
The salmon are running, my man.
You gotta stay here. Gotta field phone calls.

1193
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:18,070
You can't go out playing golf, having fun.

1194
01:11:18,111 --> 01:11:20,906
Fun? Señor, you have obviously
never played Wingfoot.

1195
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:25,035
Come on, stop playing around here.
Let's go. You got work to do this week.

1196
01:11:25,118 --> 01:11:29,998
I'm not asking you if I can leave, Walter.
I'm telling you that's how it is. All right?

1197
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:33,252
You want my picks, I can give you those.

1198
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:36,630
Washington minus eight against Miami,
Washington.

1199
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:39,341
Saint-Louis, KC.
Out of your mind? Las Vegas.

1200
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:42,594
You're gonna start picking
on Tuesday for the weekend, huh?

1201
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,431
Philadelphia. I love it. Look at that. Cinci.

1202
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:52,187
We'll be advising in the neighborhood
of 20 million dollars this week.

1203
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:56,233
That's a nice neighborhood.
We should be doing double that by week ten.

1204
01:11:56,316 --> 01:11:59,611
I see. You're gonna make the picks.
No study, no analysis.

1205
01:11:59,653 --> 01:12:01,655
You're just gonna pick 'em.

1206
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:03,949
Locked in, Walter. I don't really need it.

1207
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:07,452
Look at that. You've got to be kidding me.
Vegas, Monday night.

1208
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:09,204
There's my picks for this week.

1209
01:12:09,288 --> 01:12:13,458
Now, if you want next week's picks,
I can give you those by Friday.

1210
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:16,545
- If you wanna join us, you can.
- No, I'm getting the drift.

1211
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:20,007
Tell you what. We'll keep these on ice
and go over 'em tomorrow.

1212
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:22,634
- I won't be in tomorrow.
- Well, then, the next day!

1213
01:12:22,676 --> 01:12:25,679
Uh, we'll talk about it.

1214
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:29,224
Hey, Brandon!

1215
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:31,268
- Toni!
- Hey!

1216
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,729
- Where you headed?
- Some of us have to work.

1217
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:37,149
- Oh, oh, oh. There we go.
- Baby.

1218
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:40,194
- Hey, you look great.
- Nice ride.

1219
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:43,822
- "900 K-I-N-G." Did you see the plates?
- Yes, I did.

1220
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:59,046
- You feel that? You feel that?
- Don't. Slow down, Brandon.

1221
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:03,050
- Oh, this car was made to go fast.
- No. Not with me in it. Slow down.

1222
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,052
Loosen up, will you? Hey.

1223
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:08,013
Let me ask you a question.

1224
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:11,225
When you're not at the salon,
or running Julia to play dates,

1225
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:16,813
or keeping Walter in line, which I know
is a full-time job, what do you do for you?

1226
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:20,859
- I stay busy. You're gonna turn here, so...
- That's not what I asked.

1227
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:25,572
What do you do for you, for Toni?

1228
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:31,078
I was a junkie, Brandon. OK?

1229
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,956
So every day I get up and I wonder,
"Is this the day?"

1230
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:38,210
"Is this the day I slip,
end up back on the street?"

1231
01:13:38,293 --> 01:13:42,089
Just keeping it all on track,
that's what I do for me.

1232
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:45,300
Well, that's not living, Toni.
That is not living.

1233
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:49,429
That is maintaining.
That's cashing in. That is not living.

1234
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,849
What the hell does that mean?

1235
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:55,227
Are we talking perfection?
You wanna talk perfection?

1236
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,479
No. Nobody's perfect.

1237
01:13:57,563 --> 01:14:02,067
Oh, except for me last weekend,
going 14 and 0, huh?

1238
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:11,827
- This is your stop.
- Well, thanks for the ride... John.

1239
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:24,131
In other action, Washington melted down
in Miami, losing 24 to 12.

1240
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,550
Saint-Louis shocked KC 34-14,

1241
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:30,721
and Philadelphia
smacked Pittsburgh 23-10.

1242
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,432
- I'm gonna go work out.
- No, you're not.

1243
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,642
There's half a dozen games left here.

1244
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:40,439
I want you to watch every second
of every minute of every one of them.

1245
01:14:40,522 --> 01:14:42,191
All right, so sit down.

1246
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:44,610
Oakland is having a miserable time.

1247
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:47,196
Berman.

1248
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:51,158
You know how you go
three and 11, don't you?

1249
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,204
You go three and 11 when
you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday.

1250
01:14:55,287 --> 01:14:58,123
'Cause it rained in Cincinnati on Saturday.

1251
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:01,251
Two starting quarterbacks
never got to play.

1252
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:04,713
That's how you go three and 11.
You're a handicapper, not a psychic.

1253
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:08,133
- We still got Monday and the parlay.
- Fuck Monday and the parlay.

1254
01:15:08,175 --> 01:15:11,970
This isn't about that. This is about me.
It's about the commission thing.

1255
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:15,390
- Oh, no. I don't know.
- Oh, don't bullshit me. Come on.

1256
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:19,478
All right, listen.
I'm gonna bump you. 10%. OK?

1257
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,730
You earned it.

1258
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:27,069
This is dangerous territory we're getting into.
You understand? But I'll bump you.

1259
01:15:27,152 --> 01:15:29,488
Now, talk to me about Monday night,

1260
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:33,825
because everyone, I mean everyone,
will double down after the hole you put 'em in.

1261
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,161
- It's fine.
- You'd bet your mother's house?

1262
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:38,330
- I don't bet, Walter.
- If you did?

1263
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:41,708
- I like the pick, Walter.
- On your mother's house or not?

1264
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:43,585
With my mother in it.

1265
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:47,714
Another Monday-night
thriller comes down to the final seconds.

1266
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:50,759
Carolina has to get at least
into field-goal range here.

1267
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:52,678
High snap, pulled down nicely.

1268
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:55,013
And a beautiful punt by Feuderday.

1269
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:57,558
He drills it. Thompson has to retreat.

1270
01:15:57,599 --> 01:16:01,562
And Thompson dropped the ball. The ball
is on the turf, and the scramble is on.

1271
01:16:01,603 --> 01:16:03,981
It's heading toward the Carolina goal line.

1272
01:16:04,064 --> 01:16:07,734
A couple of guys jump on it.
It might be changing hands right now.

1273
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:09,486
Fuck!

1274
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:13,240
The call goes to Cleveland.
Carolina won't have a shot...

1275
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:15,450
- Fuck!

1276
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:21,248
This one is over.
An unbelievable finish.

1277
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:28,338
You don't switch to
a three-four halfway through the season.

1278
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:30,799
No, what defense
are they running in practice?

1279
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:34,511
Jones is on the field. Sunday.
We're still leaning heavy on the overs.

1280
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,221
Thank you, thank you, sir.

1281
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,098
You are the man. I'll talk to you...

1282
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:43,520
His improvement's been great, but he got
out of surgery two and half weeks ago.

1283
01:16:43,604 --> 01:16:46,982
I know he's had a good week of practice,
but his knee's swollen.

1284
01:16:47,065 --> 01:16:50,360
Help me out. Game-time decision.
That's what coach always says.

1285
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:54,656
Are we talking game-time probable, huh?
Or doubtful?

1286
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:57,993
Tell me. You're going into...
It's raining, it's snowing.

1287
01:16:58,076 --> 01:17:00,454
Can his knee hold up in that?

1288
01:17:00,495 --> 01:17:02,998
Will the doc let him play?

1289
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:05,542
Yes, he is a gamer. Thank you.

1290
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:08,462
I can read between the lines. You got it.

1291
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:11,340
Unbelievable! Yee-ha!

1292
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:14,885
Takes the snap, drops the throw.

1293
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:24,853
Whoa!

1294
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:27,648
Hell of a swing.

1295
01:17:30,108 --> 01:17:32,236
Sport of kings, right?

1296
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:35,614
- No, no. That's horse racing.
- What are you doing here?

1297
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:39,243
- Southie told me where I could find you.
- Yep.

1298
01:17:39,326 --> 01:17:42,037
I wanted to get out. Clear my head.

1299
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,207
So talk to me. How'd we do?

1300
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,210
- You haven't seen the scores?
- Nope.

1301
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:53,298
That's how I wanted it.
Make my picks, get the results later.

1302
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:59,721
- Well... highest sales volume ever.
- Yeah?

1303
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:03,684
- Take a guess how we did.
- I think we kicked ass.

1304
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:08,730
- It was amazing.
- Yeah, last week was nothing, Walter.

1305
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:15,612
You're right. It was nothing
compared to what we lost today.

1306
01:18:17,447 --> 01:18:18,615
What'd I go?

1307
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:23,370
I got an idea. Why don't I give you
a glimpse of what happened,

1308
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:26,665
and then you take a stab
on how you went?

1309
01:18:26,748 --> 01:18:28,417
Just give me the numbers.

1310
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,420
You don't wanna play?
Too bad. Would've been fun.

1311
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:33,547
Grown men crying on the phone.

1312
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:35,841
Their wives screaming in the background.

1313
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:38,886
Three salespeople quit -
couldn't take the pressure.

1314
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,680
- Fuck.
- No, no, no.

1315
01:18:41,722 --> 01:18:45,350
You lose ten out of 12,
"fuck" doesn't quite cover it.

1316
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:48,896
You know what would be more appropriate?
"Holy Fucking Shit!"

1317
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:53,108
Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"

1318
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:56,570
- I got the picture, Walter.
- You're right.

1319
01:18:56,612 --> 01:19:00,449
You go two for 12
on our highest volume weekend ever,

1320
01:19:00,532 --> 01:19:02,826
and...

1321
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:04,745
what's left to say?

1322
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:07,789
Except maybe
we keep the phone number,

1323
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,876
only we switch it over
to a fucking suicide hotline.

1324
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:14,546
Tomorrow morning, Brandon,
bright and early,

1325
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,508
we start all over again.

1326
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:37,736
- Mr. Novian wants to see you.
- Argh!

1327
01:19:38,695 --> 01:19:41,657
Tell him... to call me. Argh!

1328
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,076
You tell him.

1329
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:48,705
- I didn't recognize you without the suit.
- This is my time off.

1330
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:51,250
If you want to talk, make an appointment.

1331
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:54,086
Or should I call you Brandon?

1332
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:58,006
Someone costs you 30 mill,
you do research, right?

1333
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,008
I mean, I got more than your name now.

1334
01:20:00,092 --> 01:20:04,054
I know where you live, where you're from,
where your family lives.

1335
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:07,057
Hey, your mother,
there's a sweet lady, man.

1336
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:12,271
I just come from Vegas. Dealt me
three blackjacks in a row. She's a good woman.

1337
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:17,985
Where's the cocky motherfucker
who come to my house? Where's John?

1338
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:21,196
If you don't like my picks,
use somebody else.

1339
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:29,371
Come here. It's all right. It's all right.

1340
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:35,836
I just come for an apology. That's it.
Just look me in the eye and say you're sorry.

1341
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:39,965
I mean, say it so as to make me
believe you mean it. Come on.

1342
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,718
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck that. I'm not going to accept that.

1343
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:45,804
Come on, one more time. I'm sorry. Hey?

1344
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:50,726
- I'm sorry.
- You motherfucker. You're not even close.

1345
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:53,312
You're not even close.

1346
01:20:53,395 --> 01:20:56,523
No, it's not gonna work.
It's not gonna work.

1347
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:59,818
I'm gonna get my satisfaction.
I'm gonna get something I want.

1348
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:02,154
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
No-no-no.

1349
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:04,323
What do you mean, "No-no-no"?

1350
01:21:04,364 --> 01:21:07,492
No, look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

1351
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:09,453
- Brandon?
- OK.

1352
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:11,038
I'm sorry.

1353
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:14,416
Come on, you're not gonna tell me
you're scared of dying, are you?

1354
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:16,710
Mr. Novian, it was a bad fucking weekend.

1355
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:19,213
- It was a bad weekend?
- Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.

1356
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,883
Well let's make it a fun day.

1357
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,801
Come here.

1358
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:26,553
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:29,097
Yeah. Yeah.

1360
01:21:29,181 --> 01:21:30,891
- Come here.
- Argh!

1361
01:21:30,974 --> 01:21:32,768
There.

1362
01:21:38,106 --> 01:21:39,691
- Walter.
- I'm busy.

1363
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:44,238
Listen, I think I should lead off tonight.
I got some really strong stuff, man.

1364
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:46,657
Jerry, you got a good hole. Stay in it.

1365
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:49,701
I went eight for 12 last week.
I'm hot. I'm feeling it.

1366
01:21:49,785 --> 01:21:51,662
You had one good weekend.

1367
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:54,915
What do you mean?
SYKES system revolutionized this industry.

1368
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,417
Am I wood?

1369
01:21:57,501 --> 01:22:01,380
Where's my fucking ad? I...

1370
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:03,257
- Take a hike.
- What?

1371
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,384
- You're fired.
- I'm not fired.

1372
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,427
- You're out of here.
- You need me.

1373
01:22:07,511 --> 01:22:10,389
Get outta here, you cut-rate parasite.

1374
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,474
In six years, my worst weekend

1375
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:16,061
was never as bad
as any of this guy's last three weeks.

1376
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:20,190
You're not hearing me.
You don't work for me anymore. It's over.

1377
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:22,442
- What the hell are you doing, Walter?
- Oh!

1378
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:25,821
Am I doing something wrong?
Am I not communicating? Is that it?

1379
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:30,158
Am I not projecting enough?
He doesn't understand. You all know what I just did.

1380
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:33,203
- I fired you!
- Come on, this is me! All right?

1381
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:37,291
I've been here for you. I'm consistent
and you know it. The other guys, fuck 'em.

1382
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:41,587
- They come, they go. I'm the guy.
- No, they don't. Not him.

1383
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,131
That's true talent! Get it?

1384
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:48,385
You can't see it, I can't explain it to you.
That's why you're fired.

1385
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:50,304
Think about what you're doing.

1386
01:22:50,387 --> 01:22:54,141
You couldn't pick your nose without
a fucking computer. You're small.

1387
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:56,643
- You belong in a can.
- You've lost it!

1388
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,812
You don't touch him.

1389
01:22:58,896 --> 01:23:03,317
Now, why don't you have
some self-respect and leave?

1390
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:10,532
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Maybe I am.

1391
01:23:10,616 --> 01:23:12,951
Maybe I am.

1392
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:15,370
Good luck!

1393
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:20,334
Asshole.

1394
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:23,837
Doesn't realize I'm trying
to build an empire around you.

1395
01:23:23,879 --> 01:23:26,256
I hope you do.

1396
01:23:26,340 --> 01:23:30,677
OK, everyone. Let's go. Back to work.
Big playoff weekend coming. Chop-chop.

1397
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:05,462
Hey, Toni. This is not a good time.

1398
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:09,633
I know, but, Brandon,
I need to talk to you. It's important.

1399
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:16,390
- Not right now.
- Brandon, you have to... you have to go.

1400
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:22,521
No, I gotta... get back on track.

1401
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:24,773
It won't matter.

1402
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:29,278
You could win 100 games in a row
and it won't be enough. It'll never be enough.

1403
01:24:29,361 --> 01:24:32,489
He will ride you into the ground.

1404
01:24:33,574 --> 01:24:35,617
I'll figure it out.

1405
01:24:35,701 --> 01:24:37,536
No.

1406
01:24:39,079 --> 01:24:41,206
Brandon, please.

1407
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:13,739
John Anthony.

1408
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:17,159
- I'm wiped out, John.
- Amir.

1409
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:20,245
My business, my house,

1410
01:25:20,329 --> 01:25:23,624
my credit... everything.

1411
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:25,459
Amir?

1412
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:30,297
It's gonna be OK, all right?
We're gonna get back on track this weekend.

1413
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:33,425
- You hear me?
- Still you talk like this.

1414
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:35,802
Who the fuck are you?

1415
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:39,640
Like this is some kind of game.
You ruined me!

1416
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:44,436
I was betting a few thousand a Sunday
when I called you, but you pushed me.

1417
01:25:44,478 --> 01:25:47,481
Every call, all the time, with your talk.

1418
01:25:48,524 --> 01:25:52,110
I lost 380,000 this weekend.

1419
01:25:53,153 --> 01:25:55,739
I was going to get married.

1420
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,160
I had a life!

1421
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:05,082
Oh, no words now, huh?

1422
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:08,252
No more money to squeeze
so you shut up.

1423
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:12,965
- How do you fucking live with yourself?

1424
01:26:19,596 --> 01:26:22,015
Come on.

1425
01:26:32,651 --> 01:26:33,735
That's it!

1426
01:26:33,819 --> 01:26:35,571
Coming, Walter!

1427
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:38,490
I know what the problem is.

1428
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:41,159
- He's OK.
- I'll come back later.

1429
01:26:41,201 --> 01:26:43,036
No, no, stick around. Stay, stay.

1430
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,331
These guys are finished.
You guys want anything before you go?

1431
01:26:46,415 --> 01:26:50,377
Something to eat?
You leave the way you came in, fellas. Thank you.

1432
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:52,796
Shut the door.

1433
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:58,385
- Who's that?
- We need a Bat Light or something.

1434
01:26:58,468 --> 01:27:02,723
One of them signals you shoot up
into the clouds, so that no matter where you are,

1435
01:27:02,806 --> 01:27:05,350
you just look up, you say,
"Hey, Walter needs me."

1436
01:27:05,434 --> 01:27:08,270
Because I must've beeped you
a hundred fucking times.

1437
01:27:08,353 --> 01:27:11,732
- Who were they, man?
- The Salvation Army.

1438
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:15,277
How does someone go one for eight?

1439
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:19,823
A fucking monkey tossing darts
could do better than that.

1440
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:22,993
- What's with all the money, Walter?
- I got a plan.

1441
01:27:23,076 --> 01:27:25,370
We take your picks,
we reverse everything.

1442
01:27:25,412 --> 01:27:29,166
Like one of them "Twilight Zone"
episodes where everything is opposite.

1443
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:31,335
You say black, we go white.

1444
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:34,838
- How much is that?
- Peanuts.

1445
01:27:34,922 --> 01:27:37,966
275,000. That's how desperate I am.

1446
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:41,094
- What happened to the two mill?
- Two mill?

1447
01:27:41,178 --> 01:27:45,682
Man, I was carrying twice that in red ink
before you even showed up.

1448
01:27:45,766 --> 01:27:48,477
Look around. Everything you see
is smoke and mirrors.

1449
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,313
I got three mortgages on this house.

1450
01:27:51,396 --> 01:27:55,108
What do you wanna know?
I'm gambling again!

1451
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:00,781
To cover my losses,
I just got a loan from a guy

1452
01:28:00,864 --> 01:28:03,575
who works out of a bar
on 106th and Broadway.

1453
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:07,538
Trouble with me is, I start
betting you heavy after you went 100%,

1454
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:10,916
and I rode you right into the fucking toilet.

1455
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:15,337
I do know what the problem is, man.
We're gonna take care of all this shit.

1456
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,840
Check this out, man. I'm Brandon Lang.

1457
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:20,467
I'm the kid who played sports
and loved sports.

1458
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:23,804
I'm the kid who can pick winners.
I'm the kid you called in Vegas.

1459
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:26,265
Along the way, I lost something in here.

1460
01:28:26,306 --> 01:28:30,269
I don't know what, but I know I gotta
go back to being me, to being Brandon.

1461
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:33,939
- If I get back to being Brandon...
- You can pick again. Of course.

1462
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:37,776
- Forget John Anthony. Burn the suits.
- Mm-hm.

1463
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:40,737
My fault. I fucked with you.

1464
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:46,034
- Only two games. Two over-unders.
- That's right.

1465
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:51,623
If I get you to crunch the numbers,
sprinkle a little Brandon magic over it.

1466
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:54,459
We get the salespeople
burning up the phones...

1467
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:57,379
- Come Monday we go four for four.
- Four for four.

1468
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:59,298
- That's something.
- How's that sound?

1469
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:03,218
- This is important, you know?
- I know it is. Pressure doesn't help.

1470
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:06,096
Let's go eat something.
Let's go to Smith and Wo's.

1471
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,473
Brandon's gotta stay
and do some homework.

1472
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:11,602
The Brandon thing.
You see, I'm forgetting.

1473
01:29:21,236 --> 01:29:23,864
Two games. Two games. Two games.

1474
01:29:27,701 --> 01:29:30,662
Two games. Two games. Two games.

1475
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:32,039
Hey, what... Ho!

1476
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:38,420
People living in the zone.
What does that mean?

1477
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:50,140
His hair was all over.

1478
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,917
Brandon made these picks?

1479
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,253
You're looking at him.

1480
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:23,382
New York in the under.
Tennessee in the over.

1481
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:25,884
Sell 'em hard.

1482
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:30,055
Hello and welcome. The Conference
Championship game is underway.

1483
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:33,392
- Can I watch, Daddy?
- Come to Daddy.

1484
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,727
My angel. I need you to root for me.

1485
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:40,065
You see that team? Those are the bad guys.
We don't want them. That's Atlanta.

1486
01:30:40,107 --> 01:30:43,068
We want the good guys, the blue team.
That's New York.

1487
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:46,196
And New York has gotta win
by more than five points,

1488
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,740
only you gotta root for a low score, OK?

1489
01:30:48,824 --> 01:30:53,120
Because both teams together
have to make less than 42 points, total.

1490
01:30:53,203 --> 01:30:57,040
All right, so it's New York
in under 42 points.

1491
01:30:57,124 --> 01:30:58,959
All right?

1492
01:30:59,042 --> 01:31:03,088
Smith is wide.
Cohn changing the play, audible lies.

1493
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:05,924
At the line of scrimmage.
He doesn't like the defense.

1494
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:09,303
Robinson in motion to the left.
Jones alone in the backfield.

1495
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:12,514
Cohn back to passer. He's got the rookie.

1496
01:31:12,598 --> 01:31:15,100
- Anderson is in the middle...
- Go, go, go!

1497
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:17,269
- In the end zone.
- Yeah!

1498
01:31:17,311 --> 01:31:20,772
Touchdown, New York,
and they take the early lead.

1499
01:31:20,856 --> 01:31:22,900
Midway through the second quarter now.

1500
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:27,196
Atlanta down 10-0, but they're making
their first serious threat of the game.

1501
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,531
- Thomas, delay action...
- Get him!

1502
01:31:29,615 --> 01:31:32,326
Over the top.
Touchdown, Atlanta!

1503
01:31:32,409 --> 01:31:36,997
10-7 and New York is on the move.
Cohn now back to throw.

1504
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:39,333
He's over, he's over, he's over.

1505
01:31:39,416 --> 01:31:42,961
Simpson's got it!
He fumbles it. He's in the end zone!

1506
01:31:43,003 --> 01:31:46,965
That's a touchdown!
It's now 17-7 New York.

1507
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:49,301
- And we'll be right back.
- Whoo!

1508
01:31:49,384 --> 01:31:52,471
Less than a minute to go.
New York seconds away

1509
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,806
from making their third trip
to the big game.

1510
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:59,728
A New York score here and this game
is all but over. He's got Simpson.

1511
01:31:59,811 --> 01:32:02,731
- Touchdown, New York!

1512
01:32:02,814 --> 01:32:06,735
24-14. Now it is out of reach.

1513
01:32:06,818 --> 01:32:11,198
New York ready to take on the winner
of our next game, KC against Tennessee.

1514
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:13,992
The boy is back. First of two, baby!

1515
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:17,162
Atlanta may just take a knee here.

1516
01:32:17,246 --> 01:32:18,914
Way to do it!

1517
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:22,918
Why not throw it long?
He puts it up for grabs. It's a Hail Mary.

1518
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:26,338
- Knock it down! Knock it down!
- Oh, no.

1519
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:28,674
A wall of blue shirts...

1520
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:30,801
Come on! No!

1521
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:35,180
It is tipped in the air.
It's still loose. It is bouncing all around.

1522
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:38,684
- Jesus!
- Peterson comes down.

1523
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:41,937
- He's at the 20.
- Come on!

1524
01:32:42,020 --> 01:32:46,859
Across the ten. Mackey
dives to keep him out of the end zone.

1525
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:48,694
No!

1526
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:52,197
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1527
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:55,075
New York wins it 24-21.

1528
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:07,379
That wraps up
our doubleheader playoff coverage,

1529
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:10,883
as Kansas City tops Tennessee 33 to 13

1530
01:33:10,966 --> 01:33:14,178
and heads for Super Forty.

1531
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,722
I'm finished, Walter.

1532
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:19,808
Oh, that's great to hear.

1533
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:21,768
Yeah.

1534
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:24,062
- I'm done, man.
- Yeah?

1535
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:26,106
I don't eat.

1536
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:28,692
I'm not sleeping.

1537
01:33:28,775 --> 01:33:32,404
What you saying? You got insomnia,
indigestion, you're gonna quit?

1538
01:33:32,446 --> 01:33:34,865
Hail Mary pass. These things happen.

1539
01:33:34,948 --> 01:33:38,368
Listen to me, man.
I'm telling you. It's over.

1540
01:33:39,453 --> 01:33:43,624
What use is John Anthony
gonna be to you now anyway, huh?

1541
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,751
With the streak he's been on?

1542
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:48,504
Come on.
I won't listen to this defeatist bullshit.

1543
01:33:48,587 --> 01:33:51,465
Hot streaks go cold. Cold streaks go hot.

1544
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:55,511
They know you went 80%
for half a season. They know.

1545
01:33:55,594 --> 01:33:58,180
They're gonna remember
as soon as you win a game.

1546
01:33:58,263 --> 01:34:00,641
Then we go into
March Madness, baseball.

1547
01:34:00,724 --> 01:34:02,684
Next year, this won't even be a memory.

1548
01:34:02,768 --> 01:34:05,229
Who said anything about next year, Walter?

1549
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:09,733
You made a career choice, buddy,
and I bankrolled it.

1550
01:34:12,277 --> 01:34:14,071
Mm-hm.

1551
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:18,242
OK?

1552
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:21,203
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

1553
01:34:22,829 --> 01:34:25,582
Of course you stick up for him. Of course.

1554
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:27,960
Oh, Walter.

1555
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:31,004
- Meaning what?
- I don't know. Meaning what?

1556
01:34:31,046 --> 01:34:33,799
Meaning whose side are you on?

1557
01:34:36,468 --> 01:34:39,513
I didn't realize I had to choose, Walter.

1558
01:34:41,515 --> 01:34:43,058
Brandon.

1559
01:34:43,141 --> 01:34:48,522
You're a champion. A champion
goes down 86 times, he's up on the 87th.

1560
01:34:48,605 --> 01:34:50,899
I'm not gonna let you stay down. No way.

1561
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:54,903
Because this is not about you. Or you.

1562
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:57,865
Or me. It's about your gift.

1563
01:34:58,949 --> 01:35:01,702
Your gift transcends all this shit.

1564
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:05,163
Your gift is cosmic. It's metaphysic.

1565
01:35:05,205 --> 01:35:08,208
It's eternal. It is God!

1566
01:35:09,835 --> 01:35:12,254
Besides, we have a contract.

1567
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:18,594
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Bullshit, bullshit.

1568
01:35:19,136 --> 01:35:22,431
- Walter, you can't own someone.
- Who owns him?

1569
01:35:22,514 --> 01:35:25,559
I created the greatest sports tout
this country's seen.

1570
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:28,187
I hooked him up with every major client.

1571
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:31,773
I built a fucking
television show around him.

1572
01:35:31,857 --> 01:35:34,026
I took out full-page ads.

1573
01:35:34,109 --> 01:35:37,154
I introduced him
to the major clients of the world.

1574
01:35:37,237 --> 01:35:41,325
I did that.
I hooked you up with everybody.

1575
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:44,286
Think you're gonna walk out the door,
take that with you,

1576
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:47,122
leave me here
holding the fucking sack? Bullshit!

1577
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:50,626
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
What has this got to do with you?

1578
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:53,879
This is between me and him.
What are you doing in this office?

1579
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:55,964
What are you doing here? Get outta here!

1580
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:58,842
Don't talk to her like that, Walter.

1581
01:36:00,093 --> 01:36:03,138
- It's between me and you.
- It is between you and me.

1582
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:07,893
Are you telling me how to talk to my wife?
You shut your fucking toilet.

1583
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:11,939
Leave. Leave, please, Brandon. Go. Go.

1584
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,233
Please. Go. Leave.

1585
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:17,653
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

1586
01:36:17,736 --> 01:36:21,240
Don't you ever talk to me like that, ever.

1587
01:36:22,658 --> 01:36:24,409
I'm sorry.

1588
01:36:30,123 --> 01:36:32,125
Hey, Brandon! Hoo!

1589
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:34,920
It's Walter. Don't get excited.

1590
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:37,506
All is forgiven.

1591
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:39,424
Hey.

1592
01:36:41,134 --> 01:36:44,179
- What time is it?
- It's 6am.

1593
01:36:44,263 --> 01:36:48,350
I gotta fly to Vegas, meet with
some clients - hand-holding thing -

1594
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:52,855
and just keep them aboard for the last game,
because you can do this thing.

1595
01:36:52,938 --> 01:36:56,483
End of the season's the perfect place
to turn a streak around.

1596
01:36:56,567 --> 01:36:59,945
I'll be back tonight.
We'll go out. We'll have a good meal.

1597
01:36:59,987 --> 01:37:04,950
You know, get you
back in the groove again. 9:30, Nobu.

1598
01:37:04,992 --> 01:37:08,620
We're turning it around.
I'll see you tonight.

1599
01:37:15,169 --> 01:37:17,754
Hey, Brandon.

1600
01:37:17,838 --> 01:37:19,464
Hey, Toni.

1601
01:37:19,548 --> 01:37:23,385
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Walter was delayed.

1602
01:37:23,468 --> 01:37:27,848
He'll be back in the morning.
Asked if I'd fill in.

1603
01:37:28,891 --> 01:37:30,893
You know what's funny?

1604
01:37:30,976 --> 01:37:33,353
He didn't call me.

1605
01:37:36,523 --> 01:37:39,151
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1606
01:37:39,234 --> 01:37:41,486
Julia did her...

1607
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:52,039
I'm sorry.

1608
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:58,337
He's gambling.

1609
01:38:00,172 --> 01:38:02,216
- Yep.
- Yeah.

1610
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:06,345
I just can't believe I'm here again.

1611
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:08,680
I just...

1612
01:38:08,722 --> 01:38:11,934
I just can't believe it, you know.
I saw it coming.

1613
01:38:12,017 --> 01:38:14,520
I just couldn't stop it.

1614
01:38:20,234 --> 01:38:22,778
I gotta win one more game.

1615
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:26,114
You can't fix this, Brandon.

1616
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,451
You can't fix it.

1617
01:38:57,437 --> 01:39:00,148
- Come here for a second.
- What?

1618
01:39:00,941 --> 01:39:05,195
I'm gonna kiss you right now, OK?
Trust me on this.

1619
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:36,518
OK, Daddy, open the present.

1620
01:39:40,606 --> 01:39:42,399
Oh!

1621
01:39:42,482 --> 01:39:46,737
Oh, look at this. It's so beautiful.

1622
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:49,781
Daddy, not the paper! In there.

1623
01:39:50,282 --> 01:39:52,743
Oh!

1624
01:39:52,826 --> 01:39:55,454
Oh, man.

1625
01:39:55,495 --> 01:39:57,122
Beautiful.

1626
01:39:57,164 --> 01:39:59,458
Baby, this is beautiful.

1627
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:01,793
- Happy anniversary.

1628
01:40:02,252 --> 01:40:04,713
- I'll get it.
- OK.

1629
01:40:04,796 --> 01:40:08,133
Oh, thank you, honey.
What am I gonna do with this?

1630
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:11,762
- It's a dangerous thing to give me.
- Brandon!

1631
01:40:11,845 --> 01:40:14,014
- Hello.
- Look who's here.

1632
01:40:14,097 --> 01:40:17,392
- Oh, you're back from Vegas.
- Join the celebration.

1633
01:40:17,476 --> 01:40:19,728
- What's going on?
- Well...

1634
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:23,273
Toni and I were married
12 years ago today.

1635
01:40:23,357 --> 01:40:25,651
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1636
01:40:25,734 --> 01:40:28,820
Angel, give Mommy her gift.

1637
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:39,164
It's OK, baby. I saved for it.

1638
01:40:39,248 --> 01:40:41,875
We got enough, believe me.

1639
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:46,171
We're not broke yet, honey. Put 'em on.

1640
01:40:46,630 --> 01:40:50,425
Come on. I wanna see them on you.
Let me see them.

1641
01:40:50,884 --> 01:40:52,970
Ooh!

1642
01:40:53,053 --> 01:40:56,473
I got beautiful taste, don't I?
Brandon, I couldn't leave you out.

1643
01:40:56,557 --> 01:41:00,310
It's sort of our anniversary,
anyway, isn't it?

1644
01:41:01,603 --> 01:41:03,689
They're made for car racing.

1645
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:08,527
The guy who wore this
won six straight times at Le Mans.

1646
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:11,113
Put it on.
Maybe you'll start winning again.

1647
01:41:11,196 --> 01:41:13,365
Walter, I can't take this, man.

1648
01:41:14,950 --> 01:41:17,536
- Why not?
- It's too much.

1649
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:21,081
We all love each other here, right?
You're family.

1650
01:41:21,164 --> 01:41:24,293
I'm like your father, you're like my son.

1651
01:41:24,918 --> 01:41:28,380
That would make you his mother,
wouldn't it, Toni?

1652
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:33,177
Oh, I said something wrong, didn't I?

1653
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:36,221
What are you doing? Keep 'em on.

1654
01:41:37,097 --> 01:41:41,643
- They're for evening, Walter.
- So what? Wear 'em to bed. Come on.

1655
01:41:41,727 --> 01:41:44,062
Brandon, I got you.

1656
01:41:44,146 --> 01:41:45,939
Who do you like in the big game?

1657
01:41:46,023 --> 01:41:49,401
- Turn that off, Walter.
- Why? What, are you camera shy?

1658
01:41:49,484 --> 01:41:52,529
- Turn that off.
- Hey, man, surprise me.

1659
01:41:52,613 --> 01:41:54,740
We'll break it
when we do the live TV show.

1660
01:42:12,299 --> 01:42:17,137
Coming up on "Sports Advisors,"
John Anthony's Super Forty selections.

1661
01:42:17,221 --> 01:42:20,390
It's live, and it's next.

1662
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:24,478
I know he's supposed to be here.
I know where he is. He's in the bathroom.

1663
01:42:30,067 --> 01:42:31,818
Fuck!

1664
01:42:31,902 --> 01:42:36,031
- Two minutes till we go live.

1665
01:42:38,575 --> 01:42:40,661
What the hell is he doing?

1666
01:42:55,175 --> 01:42:57,427
Heads, New York, tails, Kansas City.

1667
01:42:59,847 --> 01:43:02,015
Heads, over, tails, under.

1668
01:43:03,517 --> 01:43:05,394
John Anthony!

1669
01:43:12,693 --> 01:43:15,612
- Here he is.
- 40 seconds till we're live.

1670
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:18,365
40 seconds.
Come on, come on, come on.

1671
01:43:23,328 --> 01:43:26,832
- We're at 30.
- Uh, New York, minus one and a half

1672
01:43:26,915 --> 01:43:29,084
and the over, 36.

1673
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:32,129
Wanna know about those picks?

1674
01:43:32,212 --> 01:43:34,882
- 20 seconds to air.
- Hold on.

1675
01:43:34,965 --> 01:43:37,342
What should I know about 'em?

1676
01:43:37,426 --> 01:43:39,928
I flipped a coin to decide.

1677
01:43:42,514 --> 01:43:45,851
- Ten.
- Push it all the way, Southie.

1678
01:43:47,853 --> 01:43:50,272
And five, four,

1679
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:52,733
three, two...

1680
01:43:52,816 --> 01:43:57,112
Live from the WDIX studios
high above Manhattan,

1681
01:43:57,196 --> 01:43:59,406
here's your host, Walter Abrams.

1682
01:43:59,489 --> 01:44:02,826
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to the big weekend.

1683
01:44:03,285 --> 01:44:07,956
Never before in the history of this industry
has an offer been made

1684
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:10,584
like the one I'm about to present
to you now.

1685
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:15,422
I am so confident
in John Anthony's picks for this Sunday,

1686
01:44:15,506 --> 01:44:20,219
I'm so sure of the skills
he's brought to bear,

1687
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:23,096
and so anxious for you
to get on the phone

1688
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:25,807
and dial the toll-free number
on your screen

1689
01:44:25,891 --> 01:44:29,853
that for the first time
in sports-service history,

1690
01:44:29,937 --> 01:44:33,732
I am going to guarantee our picks
this weekend.

1691
01:44:34,525 --> 01:44:38,987
- What's that mean?
- What does that mean? It means this.

1692
01:44:39,071 --> 01:44:43,283
You tell us how much you're betting
with your bookie,

1693
01:44:43,367 --> 01:44:46,328
you lose, we cover.

1694
01:44:47,412 --> 01:44:50,582
You heard me right. That's risk-free.

1695
01:44:50,624 --> 01:44:53,252
Now let's go to the oracle,

1696
01:44:53,335 --> 01:44:55,462
God's gift, John Anthony.

1697
01:44:55,546 --> 01:44:59,091
Wow. That's all I can say.

1698
01:44:59,132 --> 01:45:03,595
The phones are gonna be flooded, Walter,
and they should be.

1699
01:45:03,637 --> 01:45:08,267
Hey, John, why don't you run down
the pitfalls facing the average bettor?

1700
01:45:08,308 --> 01:45:13,605
I mean, when you think about it, a game
this huge, all the added dynamics...

1701
01:45:13,647 --> 01:45:16,358
I mean, uh, without your expertise,

1702
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:21,280
I guess the average bettor might as well
just, what, flip a coin.

1703
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:25,450
Walter? No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1704
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:30,747
Hang on. You can't guarantee that they're gonna win.
That's insane. Come on.

1705
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:35,669
I say if you can flip a coin to make a pick,
I can guarantee the game.

1706
01:45:35,752 --> 01:45:39,464
- What if we lose?
- Ah, fuck it. I'm ruined anyway.

1707
01:45:39,506 --> 01:45:43,969
Look, man. Cover your ass, all right.
At least cap the thing out, right?

1708
01:45:44,052 --> 01:45:47,514
- Oh, Brandon, can't you feel it?
- What?

1709
01:45:47,556 --> 01:45:51,310
- Can't you just feel it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

1710
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:54,688
Oh, I think you do. I think you do.

1711
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:58,275
You know, the best part of the best drug
in the world ain't the high.

1712
01:45:58,358 --> 01:46:01,403
It's the moment just before you take it.

1713
01:46:01,486 --> 01:46:03,697
The dice are dancing on the table.

1714
01:46:04,698 --> 01:46:07,409
Between now and the time they stop,

1715
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:10,871
that's the greatest high in the world.

1716
01:46:11,705 --> 01:46:15,834
Made up your mind yet?
It's the last minute! I'm here to make you money!

1717
01:46:15,918 --> 01:46:19,338
New York's the one-and-a-half point
favorite, the over and under is 36.

1718
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:21,548
I want you to bet New York in the over.

1719
01:46:21,632 --> 01:46:24,676
- Come on, guy, it's a fucking lock.
- It's New York in the over.

1720
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:28,639
You can parlay it, tease it,
do whatever you want, 'cause it's guaranteed.

1721
01:46:28,722 --> 01:46:31,016
- Our reputation is the guarantee.
- Tammy!

1722
01:46:31,099 --> 01:46:32,267
I'm coming.

1723
01:46:32,351 --> 01:46:35,312
28 years in the business,
we're not going anywhere.

1724
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:40,192
- Can we please get some air in here?
- You gotta make up your mind.

1725
01:46:40,234 --> 01:46:43,195
OK, that's it. Kill the phones. Come on.

1726
01:46:43,237 --> 01:46:45,656
Right now. Let's go, let's go.

1727
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:48,534
They come from New York
and Kansas City in this match-up.

1728
01:46:48,617 --> 01:46:51,161
The opening kickoff is coming up next.

1729
01:46:58,293 --> 01:47:02,756
We are under way in Super Forty. It's
a high end-over-ender. Down the middle.

1730
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:06,802
Jackson gets it, a short one for the 15,
tries to angle over to the right side,

1731
01:47:06,885 --> 01:47:09,346
stripped away from...

1732
01:47:10,055 --> 01:47:12,391
- Kansas City comes up with it.
- Ah, man.

1733
01:47:12,432 --> 01:47:17,396
Harris getting to the outside, turns,
clear path. Boy, does he have blocking.

1734
01:47:17,479 --> 01:47:19,815
- Touchdown, Kansas City.
- Shit.

1735
01:47:19,898 --> 01:47:23,235
- Sets out for the pocket. Simpson.
- He's open.

1736
01:47:23,277 --> 01:47:27,239
Guns one over the middle, Simpson
on the completion. It's second and 15.

1737
01:47:27,322 --> 01:47:29,575
- Setting up, he's got time again.
- Go, go.

1738
01:47:29,616 --> 01:47:32,160
Looks down field
and the slam intercepted.

1739
01:47:32,244 --> 01:47:35,038
- What the fuck is that?
- Dawkins finds a wave of blockers.

1740
01:47:35,122 --> 01:47:40,460
Over to the near side, he's going to go
the distance. Touchdown, Kansas City.

1741
01:47:40,544 --> 01:47:43,505
14-nothing, Kansas City over New York.

1742
01:47:45,132 --> 01:47:48,302
New York's got it now
for the third time in the game.

1743
01:47:48,385 --> 01:47:51,597
Back to throw once again,
pocket collapses and down it goes.

1744
01:47:51,638 --> 01:47:55,517
Oh, man. You better hold on
to that coin you flipped,

1745
01:47:55,601 --> 01:47:59,688
because this game keeps up like this,
I'm gonna have to borrow it.

1746
01:47:59,771 --> 01:48:02,691
Well, it's not over yet, Walter.

1747
01:48:02,774 --> 01:48:04,818
I wouldn't change my bet. Hm?

1748
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:11,116
And second and long,
second and about a dozen.

1749
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:13,785
Can they get something started?

1750
01:48:16,496 --> 01:48:19,750
What are they counting on today?
Do they have to get away

1751
01:48:19,833 --> 01:48:22,294
from the balanced attack
we've seen all season?

1752
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:27,090
Will they lose the ground game now?
Will they go over to the pass?

1753
01:48:27,174 --> 01:48:32,346
Well, there is no way they'll be able
to run when they're 14 points down.

1754
01:48:45,025 --> 01:48:49,446
Handoff goes to the second man through.
It's Jones, fullback, off the right side.

1755
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:52,491
He's got room, downfield he goes.
Will anybody catch him?

1756
01:48:52,533 --> 01:48:55,786
Deep into the secondary now.
Touchdown, New York.

1757
01:48:56,870 --> 01:49:00,707
Extra point makes it 14-7, Kansas City.

1758
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,381
Kansas scores on the eight-play
drive, capped with Rogers's 32-yard run.

1759
01:49:07,464 --> 01:49:13,554
And that's the end of the third quarter.
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, ten.

1760
01:49:13,637 --> 01:49:16,849
Back to throw once again.
Post available...

1761
01:49:16,932 --> 01:49:19,893
- Let's go!
- ...beats the safety down the right side.

1762
01:49:19,935 --> 01:49:21,937
He's in!

1763
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:23,856
All right!

1764
01:49:23,939 --> 01:49:29,570
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, 17. What
a final four minutes we're going to have.

1765
01:49:29,653 --> 01:49:31,321
- Where's Brandon?
- I don't know.

1766
01:49:31,405 --> 01:49:33,365
Where's Brandon?

1767
01:49:34,575 --> 01:49:37,077
We're back in it, babe!

1768
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:40,330
New York touchdown
and we win both bets!

1769
01:49:41,415 --> 01:49:43,166
Hey!

1770
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:46,378
- Hey, Brandon?
- I believe this'll be their final possession.

1771
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:50,299
Can they do it? Can they get it done
like they have all year long?

1772
01:49:50,382 --> 01:49:55,220
They're trailing by four. Don't forget,
the new rule doesn't apply here.

1773
01:49:55,304 --> 01:49:57,890
They've gotta get into the end zone.

1774
01:49:58,807 --> 01:50:01,727
- He left.
- I know.

1775
01:50:01,768 --> 01:50:03,979
You didn't tell me?

1776
01:50:08,108 --> 01:50:09,985
How about that?

1777
01:50:10,068 --> 01:50:13,238
No goodbye, no... no nothing.

1778
01:50:13,322 --> 01:50:17,576
- I'm sure it's all there in the letter.
- I'm sure it is.

1779
01:50:17,701 --> 01:50:20,913
I wonder what's not in here.

1780
01:50:20,954 --> 01:50:23,457
What do you mean?

1781
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:29,338
- What do you mean, what do I mean?
- He had enough. He wanted his life back.

1782
01:50:29,421 --> 01:50:31,381
He said that to you?

1783
01:50:31,465 --> 01:50:34,384
Well, loud and clear, by leaving.

1784
01:50:35,969 --> 01:50:39,765
- I think it was something else.
- Yeah? Tell me.

1785
01:50:40,557 --> 01:50:42,684
You know.

1786
01:50:43,310 --> 01:50:44,770
No.

1787
01:50:44,811 --> 01:50:47,481
You have no idea?

1788
01:50:49,525 --> 01:50:53,529
- You're missing the game, Walter.
- Oh, no. This is the game.

1789
01:50:53,612 --> 01:50:55,781
On first down,
the handoff is to Jones.

1790
01:50:55,864 --> 01:50:58,951
He's on the right side.
He's got a blocker. And a first down.

1791
01:50:58,992 --> 01:51:01,286
- But he's dropped inbounds.
- Nice.

1792
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:04,289
I guess Brandon was homesick.
I don't know.

1793
01:51:04,331 --> 01:51:07,167
Or maybe he had
such deep feelings for me

1794
01:51:07,251 --> 01:51:11,421
that he couldn't face saying goodbye.

1795
01:51:16,009 --> 01:51:17,970
Wait a minute.

1796
01:51:19,888 --> 01:51:22,850
I just got an idea. Just came to me.

1797
01:51:22,891 --> 01:51:25,477
I mean, out of the blue.

1798
01:51:25,561 --> 01:51:27,563
What about this?

1799
01:51:28,438 --> 01:51:33,277
Brandon didn't tell me
he was gonna leave because...

1800
01:51:34,278 --> 01:51:36,947
you let him fuck you.

1801
01:51:38,991 --> 01:51:42,911
Back to pass, rolls under the left side.
Guns it over the middle, it's complete.

1802
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:45,747
Edwards has it, all the way
down to the 44, Kansas City.

1803
01:51:45,831 --> 01:51:47,958
Oh, God.

1804
01:51:48,542 --> 01:51:51,128
- You deny it?
- Oh, my God.

1805
01:51:52,504 --> 01:51:54,548
Do I have to, Walter?

1806
01:51:54,631 --> 01:51:56,800
You know you did.

1807
01:51:56,884 --> 01:51:59,219
Oh, you...
Another lock of the year?

1808
01:51:59,303 --> 01:52:01,263
I saw you, Toni.

1809
01:52:01,346 --> 01:52:04,224
I saw you and him, that night.

1810
01:52:04,308 --> 01:52:06,685
I never went to Vegas.

1811
01:52:06,768 --> 01:52:09,229
You mean you lied to me about the trip.

1812
01:52:09,313 --> 01:52:11,523
Oh, don't talk to me about lying.

1813
01:52:11,565 --> 01:52:15,694
- I guess you had the whole thing set up.
- Oh, don't make this about me.

1814
01:52:15,736 --> 01:52:20,032
- Just put me out there on a tray?
- I put a tray out there.

1815
01:52:20,115 --> 01:52:25,204
You didn't have to shove a fucking apple
in your mouth and sit on it!

1816
01:52:25,245 --> 01:52:29,082
He's looking for his hot receiver.
Edwards, again, got it! Kansas City, 23.

1817
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:30,876
Admit it!

1818
01:52:31,752 --> 01:52:33,545
You played me, Walter.

1819
01:52:33,629 --> 01:52:36,715
You're fucking-A I did.

1820
01:52:37,549 --> 01:52:40,719
It worked. Didn't it?

1821
01:52:40,802 --> 01:52:44,389
With eight seconds left, New York
has to spend their final time-out.

1822
01:52:44,473 --> 01:52:46,725
Brandon was right.

1823
01:52:46,767 --> 01:52:50,437
- But you don't deny it?
- It's the best pick he ever made.

1824
01:52:51,355 --> 01:52:53,649
I don't know what that means.

1825
01:52:53,732 --> 01:52:58,570
Deep drop sets up in the pocket. Fires
over the middle. Batted down at the line!

1826
01:52:58,612 --> 01:53:02,824
So after everything,
it all comes down to one final play.

1827
01:53:04,993 --> 01:53:08,997
You were gambling with me that night, Walter.
With me!

1828
01:53:10,290 --> 01:53:12,584
Brandon knew it,
because he knew you.

1829
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:15,170
He told me he was sure
you were watching somehow.

1830
01:53:15,254 --> 01:53:19,299
So he asked me in to spend the night
and put on a little show for you, Walter.

1831
01:53:19,383 --> 01:53:23,387
But I didn't believe him, Walter.
Oh, God, I didn't believe him.

1832
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:27,266
I mean, after all we've been through.
So I figured, you know, "What the hell?"

1833
01:53:27,307 --> 01:53:29,893
He slipped out the back, no big deal.

1834
01:53:29,977 --> 01:53:32,354
He never even stayed here.

1835
01:53:32,855 --> 01:53:34,398
And you.

1836
01:53:34,481 --> 01:53:37,317
You were in such a good mood
the next day.

1837
01:53:37,401 --> 01:53:39,987
I figured, "Thank God,
because he must've been wrong."

1838
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:43,448
"Otherwise, why wouldn't he confront us,
confront me?"

1839
01:53:43,532 --> 01:53:44,992
Oh, Walter.

1840
01:53:45,075 --> 01:53:49,955
So it all boils down to this.
Can New York find the end zone?

1841
01:53:50,038 --> 01:53:52,624
This is what players dream of.

1842
01:53:52,708 --> 01:53:56,295
The chance to win it on the final snap.

1843
01:53:56,336 --> 01:54:00,841
You wanted to lose! Like I was something
you could just toss on the table!

1844
01:54:00,924 --> 01:54:03,468
Only we booked your bet, Walter,
Brandon and me,

1845
01:54:03,552 --> 01:54:07,389
who evidently love you
more than you love yourself.

1846
01:54:08,765 --> 01:54:11,393
Spreads the defense.
Drops back to throw.

1847
01:54:11,476 --> 01:54:14,146
Here comes the pressure.
He bounces to the right side.

1848
01:54:14,188 --> 01:54:17,524
Your fantasy is to end up alone
with nothing!

1849
01:54:19,526 --> 01:54:21,528
I won't let that happen.
Understand?

1850
01:54:21,612 --> 01:54:24,406
I will never let that happen to you.
This is it.

1851
01:54:24,489 --> 01:54:27,659
He's on the run,
picks up a big block downfield.

1852
01:54:27,701 --> 01:54:32,706
This is real, Walter.
You and me and Julia, we're all that's real.

1853
01:54:34,666 --> 01:54:36,001
One man to beat.

1854
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:39,171
This is it, Walter.

1855
01:54:39,213 --> 01:54:41,340
He goes airborne from the five.

1856
01:54:41,381 --> 01:54:43,675
- Does he get in?
- He's in! He's in!

1857
01:54:45,219 --> 01:54:48,055
Touchdown, New York!

1858
01:55:54,162 --> 01:55:57,624
Apaches, win this game, a-whoosh!

1859
01:55:58,417 --> 01:56:01,545
Giants, with me! Over here with me!
This side, this side,

1860
01:56:01,628 --> 01:56:04,089
this side, right in front of me, right here.

1861
01:56:04,131 --> 01:56:06,341
Take a knee, take a knee, take a knee.

1862
01:56:06,425 --> 01:56:10,596
We got a tough team we're playing today,
y'all know that. Toughest on our schedule.

1863
01:56:10,637 --> 01:56:15,434
Now, most important thing
we're gonna do today is have fun.

1864
01:56:15,517 --> 01:56:20,147
I mean, have some serious fun.
We're gonna play loose and enjoy ourselves.

1865
01:56:20,230 --> 01:56:22,691
We're gonna play
this wonderful game of football.

1866
01:56:22,774 --> 01:56:24,818
- Do we wanna win?
- Yeah!

1867
01:56:24,902 --> 01:56:27,446
- What are we gonna do, play?
- Play!

1868
01:56:27,529 --> 01:56:28,947
- Huh?
- Play!

1869
01:56:28,989 --> 01:56:32,659
- Ah, let's go do it!
-

1870
01:56:38,999 --> 01:56:41,001
What's going on, chief?

1871
01:56:41,084 --> 01:56:44,129
Coach, do you really think
we can win today?

1872
01:56:44,213 --> 01:56:46,256
Ho!

1873
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:47,674
