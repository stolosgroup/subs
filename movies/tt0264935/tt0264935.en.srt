2
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,682
Should we say it one last time?

3
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,895
One cannot live fully
without embracing suicide and crime.

4
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,688
Say it.

5
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,151
A pact made with relentless fire
that requires that some live...

6
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,903
...others die.

7
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,780
On three.

8
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,240
One...

9
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,911
...two...

10
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,163
...three!

11
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,670
Each of us has within us
a weak aspect...

12
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,131
...eager to give up freedom
to be dominated.

13
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,553
But we also have a will that
desires freedom, that insists...

14
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,390
...on deciding for ourselves,
each of us individually...

15
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,934
...what is good...

16
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,644
...and what is evil.

17
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,023
Are there any questions?

18
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,906
Doesn't anyone want to challenge
Justin's thesis?

19
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:22,202
Do you all submit to this
Darwinian struggle of egos?

20
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,871
I got a question.

21
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,582
Mr. Haywood, you're awake!

22
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,208
Let's hear it.

23
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,421
What's a dork like you
know about power?

24
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,799
What would an ass like you
know about philosophy?

25
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,426
Keep it civil.

26
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,013
Are you talking about crime?

27
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,557
You should wake up more often.

28
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,560
-What about it?
-All freedom risks crime.

29
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,231
Freedom is crime. It thinks of itself
and not of the group.

30
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,944
-Thank you, Justin. Very daring.
-Thank you.

31
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,242
For those of you interested
in the source of his report...

32
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,286
...take a look at Nietzsche.

33
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,915
You really need to get laid,
Bonaparte.

34
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,805
Hey, Justin.

35
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,647
-Remember me?
-What do you want?

36
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,442
I want to blow your brains out.

37
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,654
And I'll make it look like a suicide.

38
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:42,824
Everyone would believe that
you killed yourself.

39
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,826
You won't get away with it.

40
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:49,623
Your shoe prints are unique.
They'd be traced back to you.

41
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,751
The fibers on your shirt
are all over me.

42
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,378
Your hair too.

43
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,630
It's called transference.

44
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,179
More importantly, your fingerprints...

45
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,182
...on my neck...

46
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,018
...where you touched me.

47
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:16,149
-You can't get them off skin.
-You can with a Magna-Brush...

48
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:21,488
...or a fingerprint cam or an iodine gun
and silver transfer sheets.

49
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:25,868
You don't have the discipline
to commit a murder.

50
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:28,328
Is that right?

51
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,998
Let's see.

52
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,129
Bang!

53
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,047
You're dead.

54
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:44,094
What took you so long?
I've been waiting.

55
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,055
No, I have something better.

56
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,561
-What is it?
-Absinthe. Wormwood-infused alcohol.

57
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:57,149
The molecular structure is almost
identical to tetrahedral chlorine.

58
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,568
Tetra what?

59
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,155
The active ingredient in marijuana.

60
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,243
Where did you get it?

61
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,829
Poets drank it for inspiration.

62
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,041
It's been illegal since
the turn of the century.

63
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,542
Even better.

64
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,881
To the systematic derangement
of our senses.

65
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,008
Forget the senses.

66
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,927
Let's derange the world.

67
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,721
We will.

68
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,057
When?

69
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,019
Soon.

70
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,069
What about tonight?

71
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:47,533
-What about right now?
-I have a biology--

72
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,576
Fuck your biology!

73
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,413
You always have excuses.

74
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,501
Let's forget it.

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,921
We've been planning this for months.

76
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,633
I'm sick of planning.
That's all it is with you.

77
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:08,637
It's talk and plans and dreams.
You're a jerk-off.

78
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,597
So jerk off.

79
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,475
Richard, wait.

80
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,817
Just be patient.

81
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,920
Here comes The Hyena.

82
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,800
Why can't I go inside the perimeter?

83
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,636
I told them not to let anybody in.

84
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:54,308
It's your first homicide. I didn't
want you stepping on your tongue.

85
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:00,480
Take this.

86
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,609
-What is it?
-Important tool. Hey, boys!

87
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,029
Snack time! Set up a staging area.

88
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,907
This place will be crawling
with people...

89
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,867
...including our chief.

90
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,203
-Rod?
-Yeah, Rod is not a cop.

91
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,291
Darnell, get out of my crime scene!
Come on!

92
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,669
Sorry, Cassie.

93
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:25,339
There's only one way
into a crime scene.

94
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:29,218
Put your foot where mine goes
and nowhere else.

95
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,928
Ready?

96
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,691
Ever do this in vice?

97
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,193
No.

98
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,237
Right there.

99
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,740
Looks like some kind of boot.

100
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:24,064
What's that smell like?

101
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,400
Smells like vomit.

102
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,611
That's what I thought.
Bag some for the lab.

103
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,574
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

104
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,505
-Notice the hemorrhaging?
-She was strangled.

105
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,633
Finger-shaped marks around the neck.

106
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,093
Look at this.

107
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,429
Clean cut.

108
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:39,640
-Trophy?
-That'd be my guess.

109
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:41,934
Defensive wounds.

110
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,019
She put up a fight.

111
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,063
Good for you.

112
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,149
This is a secondary crime scene. Why?

113
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:54,196
This wound would produce lots
of blood. There's very little here.

114
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,031
What about these?

115
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,450
-Piquerism.
-Pre or postmortem?

116
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,494
Post, no blood.

117
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,995
Not bad, vice.

118
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,873
Probably aced your detective's exam.

119
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,794
The wind is picking up,
we'll lose evidence.

120
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,879
Hold on to everything we find.

121
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,467
-Any idea who she is?
-No. No car, no l.D.

122
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,052
Jane Doe.

123
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,710
Hey, Bonaparte.

124
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,093
What's the matter?

125
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,055
Miss Mills?

126
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,935
Time's up. Put your pens down.

127
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,771
Exchange your test with a neighbor.

128
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,110
Number 20 is C...

129
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,112
..."Burnt Norton."

130
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,115
I suppose you find it funny.

131
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,534
What?

132
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,954
Me flunking a pop quiz.

133
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:30,751
You didn't flunk. You got 1 9 out of 20.

134
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,589
Please pass the tests forward.

135
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:42,763
Wait up, I want to talk to you.

136
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,766
-Why did you do that?
-I have motives.

137
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,309
Like what?

138
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,979
I need your help
for my physics midterm.

139
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,483
Why me?

140
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,860
Because you're a genius, okay?

141
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,781
I live at 1 1 08 Chandler.

142
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,992
Can you remember that?
Around 5?

143
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,165
Hi, Lisa.

144
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,752
-This friend--
-Turn right.

145
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,299
-It's right here.
-A houseboat. Neat.

146
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:21,009
Neat indeed.

147
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,221
I like it out here.
Not too many people.

148
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,641
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

149
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:34,439
-You gonna see me to the door?
-Of course.

150
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,317
You made detective in four years?

151
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,779
-Must be smarter than you look.
-Thank you.

152
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,365
It'll only get worse, I warn you.

153
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,870
-You been talking to the boys?
-I heard a few things.

154
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,206
They tell you why
I was called The Hyena?

155
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,085
-Why?
-Female hyenas have a mock penis.

156
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:59,131
-Draw your own conclusions.
-Does that bother you?

157
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,885
I just wear loose slacks.
It's really not a problem.

158
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:08,891
See you later.

159
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,073
No prints.
The killer must have worn gloves.

160
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,076
-So it's not a husband or boyfriend.
-Why?

161
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,954
You don't use gloves
to kill your wife.

162
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,581
Unless you've thought about it.

163
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,252
Missing ring finger.
Ritual? Serial killer?

164
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,755
-Maybe a comment on matrimony.
-A negative one.

165
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,593
Maybe we should investigate
every bad marriage in the county.

166
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:30,514
-Why don't you get on that?
-Let's start with you.

167
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,599
-Ever been married?
-Nope.

168
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,603
What's this?

169
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,066
An old murder case I was involved in.

170
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,611
The guy's up for parole,
they want me to testify.

171
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,446
What do we have on Jane Doe?

172
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:49,408
I'm checking missing persons
nationwide.

173
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,953
Run her prints,
have an artist do a sketch.

174
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,793
I got it.

175
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:03,589
Bonaparte!
I didn't think you'd show. Come in.

176
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,971
Who did these?
They're quite good.

177
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,973
Thank you.

178
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:16,018
-You did them?
-Don't look so surprised.

179
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,936
I modeled for them too.

180
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,149
Bonaparte, you're blushing.

181
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,693
Why do you call me that?

182
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,447
Ever take a career aptitude test?

183
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:29,990
No.

184
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:35,162
If you ever did, they'd recommend
you a career as a dictator.

185
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,040
Why?

186
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,959
Who would listen to me?

187
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:43,879
Where's your physics book?

188
00:16:56,058 --> 00:17:00,354
You're overfeeding that thing.
It'll get as fat as you are.

189
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:04,650
I hope this is better
than that other stuff.

190
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,068
It's KGB.

191
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,655
For $400,
it better put me on the moon.

192
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,075
You'll be totally satisfied,
I guarantee it.

193
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:14,660
Money back?

194
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,579
Come on, can't we cut a deal?

195
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,666
-You don't want it?
-I want it.

196
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,251
Richie Rich.

197
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,046
-I hate it when you call me that.
-It's a deal.

198
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:30,008
Bring me a couple
pigtailed cheerleaders...

199
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,636
...then I give it to you free.

200
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:37,182
-How can I trust that?
-I love this part.

201
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:43,230
Can I just get the product already?

202
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,107
Check this out.

203
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,861
-Come on--
-You'll get it. Hang on.

204
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,200
Listen to her. She loves it.

205
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,616
We got our Jane Doe.

206
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,787
Her name was Olivia Lake.
She missed three days of work.

207
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:25,332
Her supervisor
found the place like this.

208
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,129
What do we know about the supervisor?

209
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,675
Married, two kids, solid alibi.

210
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:41,765
Maybe she caught somebody in the
middle of a 459, and he panicked?

211
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,935
And what, took the body with him?

212
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,482
Where did these mud prints come from?

213
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:55,654
There's a planting bed out here.

214
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,870
Looks dry as a bone.

215
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,664
Maybe she watered the lawn.

216
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,712
We got a time of death?

217
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,842
Based on stomach content,
between 9 and 1 0 Thursday night.

218
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:19,678
How about 9:27?

219
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,438
Can we come in?

220
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,523
Let the games begin.

221
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,696
Sam Kennedy, AI Swanson.

222
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,867
New assistant D.A.
and former member of our department.

223
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,996
Nice to meet you.
Miss Mayweather, always a pleasure.

224
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:50,918
Heard you finally passed the bar.
Did they make it true or false?

225
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,045
She hasn't lost her sting.

226
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,089
-What are you doing here?
-Staying informed.

227
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,384
Really?
Sam, please keep him informed.

228
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,684
Thank you.

229
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,729
What do we got here?

230
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:15,692
Sorry.

231
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:41,093
-Can I have you sign off?
-Okay.

232
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:03,240
Sam, it's me. I'll be a little late.
Why don't you get started?

233
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,093
Looks like a body dump.

234
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,983
Jesus, she's alive!

235
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,544
Nice detective work.

236
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,129
How'd you find me?

237
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,007
Rule one: Talk to the neighbors.

238
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:49,137
You said a little late,
and it's been three hours.

239
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:04,903
This about that D.A., Swanson?

240
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,822
That asshole? No.

241
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,993
-He seemed okay.
-Yeah, well, try dating him.

242
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,414
He got rough with me,
so I broke his nose with a cat.

243
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,249
A cat?

244
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:19,084
Well, a ceramic cat.

245
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,094
No, thanks.

246
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,183
-Good. Then you can walk me home.
-Sure.

247
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,947
Thank you.

248
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,074
Sit down.

249
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:06,840
I should get going.

250
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,759
What's the rush?

251
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,271
Can I ask you a personal question?

252
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,315
I can hardly wait.

253
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:27,152
How did you get into this work?
Why homicide?

254
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:32,241
Someone I knew was murdered,
and I got interested.

255
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,451
-Really?
-No.

256
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,746
I'm just bullshitting you.

257
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,333
It's just the kind of crap
people like to hear.

258
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:52,344
Wait.

259
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:53,929
What are you doing?

260
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:58,100
It's called sex.
It's fun, you should try it.

261
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,150
We gotta work together.
This is a bad idea.

262
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,195
Don't worry, I won't get possessive.

263
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,532
Wait.

264
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,202
-Why are you doing this?
-Because I want to.

265
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,247
What about what I want?

266
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:21,957
What do you want?

267
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,127
-Right now?
-Yeah.

268
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,422
This.

269
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,319
Wait. Slow down.

270
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:03,290
No, no, leave that on.
Just that. Please.

271
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,667
Sure.

272
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,404
What's the matter?

273
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,449
-You gotta get up, you gotta go.
-Why?

274
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,119
Because I gotta get some sleep.

275
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,248
-Can we sleep together?
-Bed's too small.

276
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:48,293
-No, it's not.
-Come on, you gotta go.

277
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,631
Jesus!

278
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,019
I'll see you tomorrow. Good night.

279
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:34,131
The evidence is so tiny,
you wouldn't recognize it.

280
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,218
A few red and yellow carpet fibers,
some hair.

281
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,012
That's it.

282
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:45,142
The fibers will be tested to find
generic and subgeneric classes...

283
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:49,646
...then compared to a database
for the manufacturer.

284
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:54,735
Fibers consistent with a mass-produced
variety, made in Denver.

285
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:58,989
Distributed in the United States
under several names.

286
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,159
-No help.
-Same with the red fibers.

287
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,204
Several trilobal nylon fibers...

288
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:09,917
...along with other fibers
will be matched with a brand.

289
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:14,254
It's sold by Hanover Sampson
for several discount stores.

290
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,174
That narrows it down.

291
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,552
They sold 50,000 in that color last year.

292
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,848
Examination of the cuticle,
cortex and medulla of the hair...

293
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:27,434
...will reveal them to be human.

294
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:31,104
Two brown human hairs.
Definitely not the victim's.

295
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,232
All but one.

296
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,407
At first, it will baffle them.

297
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:47,913
One hair of nonhuman origin, scale
matches Cynocephalus maimon.

298
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,250
It's a freaking baboon hair.

299
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,964
No fingerprints, no murder weapon.
They have their work cut out for them.

300
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:00,467
That's what they're paid for.

301
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:06,598
Coroner said strangulation was slow.
Perhaps the victim was being tortured.

302
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,727
The postmortem stab wounds
barely broke the surface.

303
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,405
Okay, that's it.

304
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:26,118
They'll decide that, given the sloppy
nature of the crime scene...

305
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,120
...the postmortem mutilation...

306
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,874
...the profile will be that
of a disorganized offender.

307
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,792
Poor social skills.

308
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,669
Nocturnal by nature.

309
00:30:35,836 --> 00:30:37,629
Probably into pornography.

310
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,090
Intelligent, but uneducated.

311
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:42,759
Lives alone,
few relations with women.

312
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,180
Attack was spontaneous.

313
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:48,432
Unplanned.

314
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,146
He didn't drive down close
to the dump spot. That is planning.

315
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,065
But he left the footprints.

316
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:01,570
No evidence will lead to the suspect,
but they'll damn him.

317
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,408
-When will they have a suspect?
-They're eating out of our hands.

318
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:09,203
Poor Ray. He'll never see it coming.

319
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,538
Cassie, look at this.

320
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,669
Vigi boots.
What the hell are Vigi boots?

321
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,715
There he is, in the black coat.

322
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,510
Don't let him charm you too much.

323
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,720
Richard Haywood?

324
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:33,727
Cassie Mayweather, Sam Kennedy,
police. Can we talk to you?

325
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:36,271
Yeah, sure.

326
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,694
You're willing to speak
without an attorney?

327
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,446
Sure.

328
00:31:45,405 --> 00:31:48,617
Where were you last Thursday night?

329
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,706
-What is this about?
-Answer the question.

330
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:59,837
I was cramming for this calculus
midterm. I was with a study group.

331
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:04,550
-How long?
-From about 7 until 3 Friday morning.

332
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:08,637
-That's quite a cram session.
-Yeah, well....

333
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:14,518
I got kind of a spotty record, and I
gotta keep my grades up for college.

334
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,776
Can you give us the names
of the other people there?

335
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,029
Sure. Am I in some kind of trouble?

336
00:32:26,822 --> 00:32:30,200
You seem very particular
about your appearance.

337
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:32,870
Thanks.

338
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:35,998
I like your outfit too.

339
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,917
She looks good.
It's, like, feminine...

340
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:42,337
...but it still manages
to be professional.

341
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:44,590
Is that like a pleather?

342
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,092
Kmart.

343
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,428
We're interested in your shoes.

344
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,930
Let's talk about these.

345
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,893
-Vigis?
-You own a pair of these?

346
00:32:57,728 --> 00:33:02,941
You bought them at Scarlatti's,
downtown Santa Barbara, for $637.50...

347
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,986
...on your platinum bankcard.

348
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,655
Size 1 2D.

349
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:13,494
This can't be about my shoes.

350
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,287
Why not?

351
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:19,249
This is about my shoes?

352
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:26,673
You got me freaked out
like I did something.

353
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:29,343
Did you find them or what?

354
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:33,680
I reported them stolen
three weeks ago.

355
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,392
I even filed a report
with the front office.

356
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,438
Did you find the shoes or not?

357
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:47,236
I think you should tell me
what's going on.

358
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:50,322
Because I'm spinning out here.

359
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:55,118
Shoe prints matching these were found
at a murder scene last week.

360
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,830
-The Covington woman?
-That's right.

361
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:02,376
You think the person who stole
my shoes committed this murder?

362
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,879
I'll cooperate in any way I can.

363
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,173
Any idea who stole your boots?

364
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:11,385
No, I don't. I wish I did now, though.

365
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:15,180
-Any enemies at school?
-Well, it's high school.

366
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,140
What does that mean?

367
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:21,228
Not to sound arrogant,
but there are people who envy me.

368
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,105
-Really?
-Yeah.

369
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,107
Why would they do that?

370
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:29,570
Well, let's just say
that I'm very fortunate...

371
00:34:29,778 --> 00:34:33,115
...and that I've been blessed
in many ways.

372
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,911
-Must be nice being you, Richard.
-I got no complaints.

373
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,584
It all checked out.
He filed a report about the boots.

374
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,587
And made a big fuss to the principal.

375
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,673
Yeah, I bet he was a pain in the ass.

376
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:55,470
-She didn't say that.
-No, believe me. I hate kids like that.

377
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,931
Like what?

378
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:04,229
What about the study session?

379
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,652
Six kids were at his house with him
from 7 or 7:30 Thursday evening...

380
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:14,031
...till 3 a.m. Friday.
I talked to all of them.

381
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:16,950
He was there except for 1 5 minutes...

382
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:20,078
...he went to an ATM
to get cash for a pizza.

383
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:25,876
-Did you check that out?
-Yeah, he withdrew $40 at 9:1 9.

384
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,256
Get that enhanced.

385
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,551
-Why?
-Because I can't see his face.

386
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,178
It's him.

387
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,640
I can't see his face.

388
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,686
-You really think he's involved?
-I don't know.

389
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,649
But something's not right
with that kid.

390
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:52,444
Fifteen minutes.
It doesn't give him enough time.

391
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:57,032
He has to drive to Covington,
kill her, dump her body, get back.

392
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,827
He'd need at least an hour.

393
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,068
-They questioned me.
-And?

394
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:36,071
-It was so cool!
-Did they go for the shoes?

395
00:36:36,238 --> 00:36:40,200
They grabbed it. I was so good.
I really was. Listen.

396
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:42,369
This can't be about my shoes.

397
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,580
-Why not?
-Did you find them?

398
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:49,293
You sure they didn't suspect anything?
You didn't overdo it?

399
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:54,423
A little bit.
I overdid it a little bit.

400
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:59,178
You think the person who stole
my shoes committed this murder?

401
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:04,057
I want you to know
I'm gonna cooperate in any way I can.

402
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,853
Meet me at the bluff tonight.

403
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,813
I can't.

404
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:17,112
-Why not?
-I have something to do.

405
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:22,743
-Like what?
-I'll tell you later. I should....

406
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:32,419
-Know who his father is?
-I wanna search his house.

407
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,506
Lawrence Haywood. He built the mall.

408
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:38,467
-Big campaign contributor?
-That's right.

409
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:41,720
And I won't fuck
with that guy on this.

410
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:47,226
I've grown much too fond of my own ass
to do anything that goddamned stupid!

411
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,104
And what is your problem?

412
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:54,274
Where are you on this, Sam?

413
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:59,321
-I don't care who his father is.
-I don't mean that.

414
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:02,533
Do you think we have enough
to go after him?

415
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:09,915
No. And if we go in too soon,
we could burn the whole case.

416
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,251
Really? And why is that, vice?

417
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:16,088
No judge would sign a warrant
based on what you have.

418
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:17,840
Shut up, Swanson!

419
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:21,552
-This kid with his attitude--
-Attitude isn't a crime.

420
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:25,097
-It's an indicator--
-But he doesn't fit the profile.

421
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,516
The profile doesn't fit!

422
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:32,896
The killer was smart. He didn't drive
to the site, he used Richard's boots...

423
00:38:33,105 --> 00:38:36,900
-...but the attack was unplanned?
-But if we push too soon--

424
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,486
-Whose case is this?
-Just calm down.

425
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:43,866
No, I've been trying to find
Olivia's killer, busting my ass--

426
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,784
-Who's Olivia?
-The victim.

427
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:49,746
-Is this still my case?
-It's a coordinated effort!

428
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:54,251
You're getting way too involved
in this, Cassie.

429
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,005
-Cassie!
-What?

430
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:01,049
-You called her by her first name.
-What?

431
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:04,803
You said, "I've been trying
to find Olivia's killer."

432
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,638
No, I didn't.

433
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:10,309
Did l?

434
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:16,899
You're supposed to be identifying
with the killer, not the victim.

435
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:20,527
Remember that?

436
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:29,745
You don't have any witnesses
or fingerprints or powder burns....

437
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,580
I almost forgot.

438
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:37,127
Tobias always kept a gun,
right here. Loaded.

439
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,338
Can I come in?

440
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,807
Listen, I'm sorry
I didn't back you up in there.

441
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,269
I'm a big girl.
You said what you thought, right?

442
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,147
-Yes, but--
-Then you did the right thing.

443
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:02,486
-We can't just bust in there--
-I know. I heard you.

444
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:06,573
-So can you get out of the way?
-Know what your problem is?

445
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:10,452
Yeah, you're blocking Matlock.
Out of the way. Please.

446
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:13,914
I'm trying to apologize here.

447
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:18,961
All right, apology accepted.

448
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,005
You want to sit down?

449
00:40:24,258 --> 00:40:26,426
You want to have a cookie?

450
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:49,116
-Hi.
-Hi.

451
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,418
-What's going on?
-We're making up.

452
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,130
-We're still friends, right?
-What's this?

453
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,424
I don't know, let's find out.

454
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:10,596
-We do this and you throw me out again?
-Or you stay. Or you leave.

455
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:13,807
I don't know.
It's hard to tell in advance.

456
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,936
What do you want?
You want promises? You want a ring?

457
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:21,607
-Is that what you want? A ring?
-Don't!

458
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:28,780
Look, it's not just about sex, okay?
I really respect you as a person.

459
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:32,701
Is that what you--?

460
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,580
Why do you always want to hurt people?

461
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,459
I wouldn't say always.
It kind of happens sometimes.

462
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:44,630
You're so good at breaking
other people down...

463
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:47,799
...but you never stop
and look at yourself.

464
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:47,359
-Where are you taking me?
-No peeking, we're almost there.

465
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:49,111
Step up.

466
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,366
Okay.

467
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,535
Open your eyes.

468
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,957
My God, Justin, this is beautiful!

469
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,336
Did you grow these?

470
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:16,346
What happened? You're different.

471
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,932
Yeah, I am different.

472
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,582
Mayweather.

473
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:48,587
Collect call from an inmate
in a corrections facility.

474
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:51,673
-The name of the inmate is....
-Carl Hudson.

475
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,635
If you wish to accept, press--

476
00:44:07,773 --> 00:44:10,984
-I do not wish to accept any calls--
-Cassie?

477
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,529
-What?
-It's Sam.

478
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:17,199
Hi, I'm sorry. What can I do for you?

479
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:21,036
-Remember the puke at the body dump?
-Yeah.

480
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:24,122
Most of it was unidentifiable...

481
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:28,293
...but Kevin managed to isolate
some partially digested eggs.

482
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,420
-Fish eggs.
-Caviar?

483
00:44:30,629 --> 00:44:36,552
Apparently so. I've compiled a list
of the local vendors selling caviar.

484
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:45,310
-What was his name?
-Richard Haywood.

485
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:48,939
Miles Haywood's kid?
He came in once around Christmas.

486
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,774
Not last week? Thursday?

487
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:53,735
I rarely see
any high-school kids here.

488
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:55,988
-Except Justin Pendleton.
-Who?

489
00:44:56,196 --> 00:45:00,075
He used to come with his father,
but his parents split.

490
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,620
Now he comes in alone.
He's a senior at Jefferson.

491
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:07,499
Richard's a senior at Jefferson.
Justin eats alone?

492
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:11,211
He always brings a book.
He's a bit of a loner.

493
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,673
But a brilliant kid,
you should hear him talk.

494
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,009
When was he in here last?

495
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,513
The 5th. 7:30 p.m.

496
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:25,559
-What time did he leave?
-About 9.

497
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:28,020
Do you know what he ate?

498
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,319
Justin?

499
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:38,906
Cassie Mayweather,
with the San Benito Police.

500
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:44,369
-You're a police officer?
-I'm a homicide investigator.

501
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:48,832
-Can I ask you a couple questions?
-Sure.

502
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,544
You had dinner
at Maison Saint Croix on the 5th?

503
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:56,590
-Maison Saint Croix.
-Thank you.

504
00:45:56,798 --> 00:46:01,845
The 5th was a Thursday, and they had
a caviar appetizer. Did you have it?

505
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:07,851
Yeah, I might have.
Can you tell me what happened?

506
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,854
-Do you know Richard Haywood?
-Everyone knows him.

507
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,232
Is he involved in this?

508
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:15,984
-Is he a friend of yours?
-No.

509
00:46:16,193 --> 00:46:22,241
I mean, I tutored him for his bio
SAT last year, but we're not....

510
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:25,494
We don't have much in common.

511
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:29,748
-Are you in his study group?
-No. What study group?

512
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,836
When you left the restaurant,
did you take leftovers?

513
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:38,549
You didn't give your friends
at the study group leftovers?

514
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:43,929
Look, I told you, I barely know him.
He makes fun of me in class.

515
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:47,808
-Why would he do that?
-Because...

516
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:51,061
...he's like that.
He makes fun of everyone.

517
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,438
He's one of the cool kids.

518
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,941
What makes him cool?

519
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,487
You know, he's smart, he's rich...

520
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:03,198
...he's witty, and everyone likes him.

521
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:05,450
And you don't.

522
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:11,623
Yeah, I knew kids like that.
Superstars of high school.

523
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:15,794
Five years from now,
nobody will care who they are.

524
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:18,964
Well, Richard will always be cool.

525
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:23,468
His daddy's rich and I hate
to admit it, but he's actually smart.

526
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:28,140
He's lazy and didn't study,
but he got a 71 0 on that bio SAT.

527
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:31,894
-It kind of spun me out.
-Spinning out, huh?

528
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:36,440
You seem to know him well.

529
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:39,318
You can tell by his behavior in class.

530
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,278
Sorry.

531
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:48,577
Cassie, where have you been?
Sam l.D. 'd the suspect.

532
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:53,123
-Who is it?
-Ask Sam. He's in charge of the case.

533
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,919
S.I.D. is over there now
collecting evidence.

534
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:08,847
-Hi, Cass.
-Hi.

535
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:11,141
Look at this, sir.

536
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:13,852
-Could be a match.
-Log that.

537
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:19,817
I want samples of fabrics, soils,
any molds, plants in here and outside.

538
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:22,778
John's found a stash
of marijuana buds.

539
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:26,698
-You mind if we smoke up while we work?
-Yes, I do.

540
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:33,288
-So who is he?
-Raymond Lee Feathers.

541
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:35,624
He's a janitor at Jefferson.

542
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:40,754
I compiled a list of everyone
who might have stolen Richard's boots.

543
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:46,134
Then I cross-indexed that against
carpet purchases and up came this.

544
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:51,473
Apparently he sold grass
to the kids at school.

545
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:55,394
-Good work.
-Thank you.

546
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:57,271
Where is he?

547
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,732
I don't know. Seems like he took off.

548
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:06,280
-Did you run him for priors?
-A couple DUls, one pot bust.

549
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:11,410
But he hasn't shown up for work since
the day we talked to Richard there.

550
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:13,537
Did you find the boots?

551
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:17,875
Not yet, but we may have a match
on the yellow carpet fibers.

552
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:22,004
We've nothing on the vehicle fibers
till we find his car...

553
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:25,507
...but he's got a stash
of porno films, mostly bondage...

554
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:28,385
...just like the profile.

555
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:30,053
What?

556
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:38,562
-He's not a neatness freak.
-What are you saying?

557
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,775
Sloppy enough to leave footprints, but
smart enough to steal shoes in advance?

558
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:47,946
-This is our guy, no question.
-You find any caviar jars?

559
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,240
Come on, wait a minute.

560
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:53,494
You're ticked that I got him,
aren't you?

561
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:56,163
No. If you got him, I'm happy for you.

562
00:49:56,371 --> 00:50:01,210
After we close this case, maybe we
should look for different partners.

563
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,420
Might be better.

564
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,214
Whatever you want.

565
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,300
Good.

566
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:13,680
-Nice work, guys.
-I gotta take a piss.

567
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:17,309
Don't worry,
I won't contaminate any evidence.

568
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:20,854
-She pees standing up, that one.
-Al.

569
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:23,732
Don't talk about her
like that, please.

570
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:25,734
You've slept with her already?

571
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:28,862
-What?
-You will. That's Cassie's m.o.

572
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:31,949
She lets you get close,
then pushes you away.

573
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:36,578
Ask her what's wrong, she picks
a fight. You're working with her...

574
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:39,081
...because no one else will.

575
00:51:33,343 --> 00:51:36,013
Looks like a body dump.

576
00:51:57,326 --> 00:52:00,704
Now we know where
that baboon hair came from.

577
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:04,458
It's okay.

578
00:52:26,355 --> 00:52:28,106
Hey, Lisa.

579
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:31,819
-You want a ride?
-We already did that.

580
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:36,198
That's not what I'm talking about.
I want to talk to you.

581
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:40,035
-Want me to beg? Please.
-You'll get in an accident.

582
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:42,913
Please. I don't care.

583
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:47,543
You make me sad. Come on.

584
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,092
Come on. It's fun in here.

585
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:23,704
Hello, Justin.

586
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:25,581
How you doing?

587
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:33,172
What are you--?

588
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,674
What are you doing here?

589
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:46,018
-You stood me up for that slut?
-Lisa? She's not a slut.

590
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:50,522
-Did you tell her anything about us?
-Of course not.

591
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,774
-Of course not.
-You fuck her?

592
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:57,404
-I was helping her with her physics.
-You fucked her, and I saw you.

593
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:02,284
We kissed.

594
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:08,040
-You kissed.
-That was it, I swear.

595
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,211
Oh, Justin.

596
00:54:13,754 --> 00:54:17,132
You helped Lisa,
and you didn't even get laid?

597
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,221
-What a schmuck.
-She's not like that.

598
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:26,016
Bullshit. She spreads
like peanut butter.

599
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:42,533
You'd be surprised what a girl without
a dad will do for male attention.

600
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:06,390
Lisa.

601
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:34,626
Do you hate me?

602
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,670
I had to do it.

603
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:43,177
I don't want to hurt you, but I had
to show you what she's really like.

604
00:55:45,971 --> 00:55:48,056
She's not good enough for you.

605
00:55:48,307 --> 00:55:53,479
She doesn't appreciate you. She's
like your mom, dad and everyone else.

606
00:55:54,229 --> 00:55:57,900
I'm the only person
who really cares about you.

607
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:03,113
I think I'm the only person who sees
how incredible you really are.

608
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:06,783
Don't go away, Justin. Come on.
What we did...

609
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:10,078
...together...

610
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,457
...how many people have done that?

611
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:17,586
We proved something to each other.

612
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:21,048
We showed what we're capable of.

613
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:25,385
There's no limits for men like us.

614
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:34,144
Did you hear about Ray?

615
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,524
They're onto him.

616
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:44,488
Just one last thing to do
and we're home free, right?

617
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:47,366
Do we have to?

618
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:50,410
You tell me.

619
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,497
Do we have to?

620
00:56:54,305 --> 00:57:54,638
