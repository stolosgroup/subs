5
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,920
Okay, now what?

6
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:54,720
TED: Cup my balls.

7
00:00:54,964 --> 00:00:57,592
ANNlE: Okay, yes.

8
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,068
TED: Oh! There it is.
ANNlE: There we go.

9
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:02,131
That feels good.

10
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,539
You know what to do.

11
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:08,776
Okay, you know what?
Slow it down, slow it down.

12
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:10,743
Okay.
Slow it down.

13
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,573
There we go.
How's that?

14
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:16,516
That's good, nice and slow.
See? Doesn't that feel good?

15
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:17,813
Yeah.
No, l want to go fast.

16
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,684
You want to go fast?
Fast.

17
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,457
Yeah. No.. .

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,891
Oh, yeah.
That feels good.

19
00:01:25,995 --> 00:01:27,292
Oh, Yeah.

20
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:28,523
Yeah.

21
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,160
Okay.
You know what?
l think.. .

22
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,065
l think maybe
we are on different
rhythms here.

23
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:23,950
l was having a nightmare.
l was so scared.

24
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:26,455
Good morning.

25
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:27,523
Good morning.

26
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:31,120
You look beautiful.

27
00:02:31,227 --> 00:02:32,558
No, l'm sure
l look terrible.

28
00:02:32,662 --> 00:02:34,596
l just woke up.
Are you kidding?

29
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,426
l'm sure l'm a mess.

30
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,691
You slept over.

31
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,462
l did.

32
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,130
l thought we had
a rule against that.

33
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,340
Oh.

34
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:46,303
l'm kidding.
Oh.

35
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:47,768
That was funny.
l'm kidding.

36
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,708
You're funny
in the morning.

37
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:51,370
l like hanging out
with you.
Oh. Yeah.

38
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:54,882
l love hanging out with you.
l think we get
along really well

39
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:58,647
and you're so sexy.

40
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,555
l know.

41
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:05,954
l just have a lot
coming up at work

42
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,690
and l don't want
to make promises
l can't keep.

43
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,559
You know what l mean?
l know you do.

44
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,634
Yeah.
We're on the same page.

45
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,670
l'm not looking for
a relationship right now,
either. Let's just say that.

46
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:18,570
Whatever you wanna.. .
l can do.. .

47
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:22,576
l'd rather just.. .
l like simple.. .
l'm not like other girls.

48
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:25,738
l'm not like,
''Be my boyfriend!''
Unless you were like, ''Yeah!''

49
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:27,816
Then l'd be like,
''Maybe.' '

50
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,215
Mmm. But let's not.

51
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,310
l don't want that either.

52
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,557
Wow, this is so awkward.
l really want you to leave,

53
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:49,434
but l don't know how to say it
without sounding like a dick.

54
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:51,230
Come on!
Hands behind your heads!
Let's go! Sit-ups!

55
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:54,761
You're looking
like pieces of bacon
on a plate.

56
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:57,772
lt's disgusting!
l smell the fat!

57
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,439
He scares me.
Me, too.

58
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,635
LlLLlAN: But he's
an excellent motivator.

59
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,937
That's true.

60
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:04,979
What are you looking at?

61
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:07,238
Oh, Shit, he sees us.
Oh, God.

62
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,077
Hey! Hey!

63
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,009
lf you want to
take this class,

64
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,187
you're going to
have to pay for it

65
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,290
like the rest
of these bitches!

66
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,451
What, are you dancing?
ln the park.. .
Dance class?

67
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:21,425
You are not dancing.
You are not
dancing in the park!

68
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,394
Go, go, go, go!
lNSTRUCTOR: Freeloaders!

69
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,655
l'm coming over there.

70
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:26,298
ls he coming?
lNSTRUCTOR:
l'm coming after you!

71
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:28,768
Sorry, Rodney.
We're on a budget.

72
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,169
lNSTRUCTOR: Oh, come on!
lt's only 12 bucks!

73
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,771
Oh, my God!

74
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,408
Come on!
You fucking freeloaders.

75
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,841
We are out
of our minds.
l know.

76
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:41,940
That's okay.
l'm so glad that
we got to do this.

77
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,211
l feel like l haven't
seen you in forever.

78
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:44,844
Mmm. l've been
in Chicago a lot.

79
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,954
l know.
Sleeping at Dougie's house.

80
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,648
Well, it's just
closer to work.

81
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,220
How is it going
with him anyway?

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,191
l don't know.
l mean, it's fine,

83
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:55,227
but l just feel
like he's been
distant lately.

84
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,026
And l don't know.. .

85
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,601
He calls me
''dude'' a lot.

86
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:00,760
That doesn't mean anything.

87
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:02,265
l think everything is fine.

88
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:03,770
l don't know.
Anyway,

89
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:05,598
what did you
do last night?

90
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:07,565
Umm.. .

91
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:09,110
What did you
do last night?

92
00:06:11,514 --> 00:06:13,106
You are not
telling me something.

93
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,550
l hung out with
Ted for a little bit.

94
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:19,550
l knew it!
We had fun.

95
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,717
lt was fun.
Here's what l
don't like about it.

96
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:25,084
You hate yourself
after you see him,
every time.

97
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:27,424
And then we go through this,
and then you feel like shit,

98
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,929
and it's almost
like you're doing it

99
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,531
because you feel
bad about yourself.

100
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:34,332
He called me late,
and we hung out.

101
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,031
lt wasn't a big deal.
And you know what?
lt was fun.

102
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,465
Ew! You had
sex with him.

103
00:06:40,543 --> 00:06:43,842
We had an
adult sleepover.

104
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,539
Ooh. Did you let him
sleep over in your mouth?

105
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:51,609
Annie!
l'm sorry!

106
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:55,657
You're unbelievable.
He kept putting
it near my face.

107
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:57,116
They do that,
don't they?

108
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,317
Why do they do that?
Let us offer.

109
00:06:58,694 --> 00:06:59,661
lf we don't offer.. .

110
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:00,796
Please.
You're supposed
to slap it away.

111
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:01,863
l couldn't.

112
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,726
You don't want to
look right at it.

113
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,027
No.

114
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:10,162
lt's too aggressive.
lt's like.. .

115
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:11,604
''Hello.' '

116
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:12,731
That's my impression.

117
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:13,809
Those are the balls?

118
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:15,433
Yeah.
l'm trying to make it round,

119
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,135
but l can't
because l have elbows.

120
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:20,838
He is so hot, though.

121
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,214
Look, l know
you say he's cute
and all that stuff,

122
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,255
but it makes you feel
like shit, you know?

123
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:29,324
You're a total catch,
and any guy

124
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,460
would be psyched
to be your man.

125
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:33,889
You should just
make room

126
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:36,422
for somebody who
is nice to you.

127
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,523
You know what?
He's honest!

128
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:40,329
He told me that
we are what we are

129
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,232
and we're just having fun.
And l like that.

130
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:45,501
He also told you that
you need dental work.
He's an asshole.

131
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:51,401
l don't need dental work.

132
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,040
You're right.

133
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:54,375
There is nothing
wrong with my teeth.

134
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,348
You are so beautiful.

135
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,654
Will you marry me?
Yes.

136
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:02,691
l love you.

137
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:03,825
l love you.

138
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:07,687
l don't want to
go to work today.
Mmm-mmm.

139
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:09,822
Let's see how many
times Terry's called me.

140
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:10,899
Oh! Only 15!

141
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,562
You know what, Terry?
l don't want

142
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,431
to pick up your
monkey lamps.
Sorry!

143
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:16,595
Monkey lamps?

144
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,539
Ugh. l cannot wait
to never work for
a psychopath again.

145
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:22,135
Oh! Annie!

146
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:25,179
l'm sorry. l should
have gone down Mason.

147
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:28,847
ANNlE: Well, l'm the genius
that opened a bakery
during the recession.

148
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,284
They were good cakes,
Annie.

149
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,684
Thank you.

150
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:35,884
Come on. Look away,
look away, look away.

151
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,755
Do you have any
ideas of styles?

152
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:42,990
Oh, l don't know.
What do you think, honey?

153
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:44,291
Whatever you want.

154
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,400
Look at how you guys
are making this
decision together.

155
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,627
That's sweet. You guys
love each other, huh?

156
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:50,205
Yeah.
Yeah.

157
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:53,071
Ohh! That's sweet.
That will go away.

158
00:08:56,112 --> 00:09:00,845
You cannot
trust anybody, ever.

159
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,147
Especially someone
you're in a
relationship with.

160
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,651
'Cause they're
living with you,
you don't

161
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,253
know who you're
sleeping next to.
lt is scary.

162
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:09,949
l mean, look at him.
He may not even be Asian.

163
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,125
lt is scary.

164
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,024
So did you guys
want to look at
these engagement rings?

165
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,364
We're going to browse.
Okay, sure.

166
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:20,762
l'll be here.

167
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:25,970
Thank you.

168
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:27,876
What was that about?

169
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,739
Umm, nothing.
They had to run.
They had to go somewhere.

170
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,008
And no wonder.
You're selling
lifelong happiness.

171
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,141
You're not telling everyone
about your problems

172
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,719
and how your
boyfriend left you,

173
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:39,377
and maybe marriage
will work out.

174
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:42,022
Show me your
''love is eternal'' face.

175
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:47,656
No, that's two years,
four years tops.
That is not eternal.

176
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,527
Kahlua, can you
come over here
for a second, please?

177
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,328
What's up, Don-Don?

178
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:54,995
You make up
the best nicknames.

179
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:57,901
You don't need
a nickname because
Kahlua is so delicious.

180
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't sue me
for touching you.

181
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,804
Show Annie your
''love is eternal'' face.

182
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,012
That looks like you
have menstrual cramps.

183
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,577
Thank you so much,
Kahlua.

184
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,252
Now, why can't you
be more like Kahlua?

185
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:20,385
Look, l'm trying
really hard.

186
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,587
You've just
got to try harder.

187
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,494
The whole reason
you have got this job,
Annie,

188
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:26,534
is because your mom
is my sponsor in AA,
and l'm doing her a favor.

189
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,602
l understand.

190
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:31,205
Oscar, get back to work.

191
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,103
You shouldn't be
behind the counter.

192
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,077
MAN ON TV: <i>Andrew,</i>
<i>you are not the father!</i>

193
00:10:46,222 --> 00:10:47,917
That's great. Yeah.

194
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,753
Stop that.
Don't do that.

195
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:55,991
Hey, Brynn.

196
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:57,463
Oh, hey, roomie.

197
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,234
Guess what
happened to me today.
Hmm. What?

198
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,460
l got a free tattoo.
You did what?

199
00:11:02,738 --> 00:11:05,400
l could not believe it.
The guy said,
''Do you want a tattoo?''

200
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:06,475
Just a random.. .

201
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:08,304
Yeah, opened up
the side of his van.
No.

202
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,810
He said, ''lt's for free!''
And l said, ''Sure.' '

203
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,247
You said yes?
Yeah!

204
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,714
Yeah. Look.
See here?

205
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,148
What is it?

206
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,284
See that?

207
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:20,888
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Brynn!

208
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,288
lt's a Mexican drinking worm.

209
00:11:23,425 --> 00:11:26,622
lt's a Native American
symbol meaning ''wasted.' '

210
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,720
Okay, Brynn,
just so you know,
it's.. .

211
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,423
Gil, hi.
Hello. How are you?

212
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,161
Have you seen
your sister's tattoo?
lt's really infected.

213
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:34,393
Better get
a little bit of ice on it.

214
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,662
Yeah, a little bit.

215
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,102
Stick some
frozen peas on there.

216
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,231
Yeah. lt can't hurt.
All right.

217
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,605
So, l just wanted
a quick word.

218
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,541
You know that
tomorrow the rent is due.

219
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:45,773
l was getting my check,
and l wondered

220
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,108
if l could get
your check, too?

221
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:49,476
Yes.
l'm getting
the money.

222
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:52,247
lt's been
a little slow.

223
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:58,215
You have to
keep it in the bag
and put the bag on it.

224
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,892
So, the check?

225
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,066
Yes. Yes.
Yeah.

226
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,503
Because it's a kind of,
like, ''needing it
today''-type situation.

227
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,665
lt's coming.

228
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:16,341
LlLLlAN: Who is it?
ANNlE: Me!

229
00:12:16,478 --> 00:12:17,502
Who is it?

230
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,472
Oh, my God.
Hurry up, your creepy
neighbor asked me

231
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:21,072
if l wanted to
watch the news again.

232
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:22,707
Sorry.
He is so gross.

233
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:25,252
Please, come on in.
Let me take your magazines.

234
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:28,414
Welcome to the magazine
and wine party. Ooh!

235
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,391
Have a seat.

236
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,722
l'm very happy
that you are here.

237
00:12:32,828 --> 00:12:35,820
What?
Because l want
to eat an apple.

238
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,463
Would you like
some apple?

239
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,728
What is that?
l got engaged.

240
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,400
What?
He asked me last night.

241
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,133
What?
l know!

242
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,706
That's why he's
been acting so weird

243
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,971
'cause he's a terrible liar,
and he thought he
was gonna blow it.

244
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,068
He was ignoring
me and l thought

245
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,270
he was going to
break up with me.

246
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,473
Oh, my gosh.

247
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:56,818
Oh, my gosh!

248
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:57,975
l know!

249
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,584
Lil!

250
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,120
l'm shocked, still.

251
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:02,722
But l'm happy.
Can you believe this?

252
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,589
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, l just got hot.

253
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:06,917
You did?
Are you okay?

254
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:07,996
Yes. My pits
are sweating.

255
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:09,655
My stomach hurts. l'm hot.
What does that mean?

256
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,893
Oh, my God!
What is happening?

257
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,128
l don't know.
l'm wearing a ring.

258
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:16,797
l can't believe it.

259
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,065
Lil, you're getting married.

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,434
l'm getting married.

261
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,043
And you'll be
my maid of honor.

262
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,677
God, of course l will!

263
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,111
lt will be super fun.
lt's gonna be really fun.

264
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:28,240
Yeah. You know,
we can plan
everything together.

265
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,841
My God!
Planning your wedding.. .

266
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,214
Are you sure
you're up for it?

267
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:34,551
l know it's a lot to ask
and to put on your plate.

268
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:37,592
And you're going
through a tricky time,
and you're super-busy.. .

269
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,183
Stop.
lt's a lot to ask.

270
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,283
Stop.
Okay.

271
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:44,127
lt's fine. And l'm
more than happy to do it,
and it's not too much.

272
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:47,467
Oh! Look at that.
lt's my fiancי calling.

273
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:49,035
Oh, your fiancי.

274
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:50,662
Hi, baby,
what's up?

275
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,142
lt's Annie.
l just told her!
Yeah, she's so happy.

276
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:56,506
No, l'm not!

277
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:58,775
''Yay,'' she said.

278
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:01,816
What, baby?

279
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:04,218
l know,
l miss you, too.

280
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,851
Yeah,
l'll meet you in an hour.

281
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:10,022
l love you, too.

282
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:34,806
ANNlE: <i>Wow.</i>

283
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,050
Wynonna Judd.

284
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:38,876
That's really good.

285
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:42,718
Painting those giant bangs
was a royal pain in my can.

286
00:14:42,825 --> 00:14:45,851
And those teeth!
l should have
painted her mouth shut.

287
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:48,326
Can you just get dressed?
We're gonna be late
for the engagement party.

288
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,522
Oh, l forgot
to tell you, honey.
What?

289
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:50,757
Forgot to tell you.
What?

290
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:54,666
l signed up to
speak at AA tonight,
and l just have to.

291
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,964
Mom!
No.

292
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,539
l forgot. l'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

293
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,074
l keep telling you,
you're not supposed
to go to those things.

294
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:02,234
You're not an alcoholic.

295
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:04,278
Only because l've
never had a drink.

296
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,478
What?
They are inspiring.

297
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:10,183
There is this one story
l've just got to tell you.
Sit down.

298
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,616
Okay.

299
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,152
This gentleman

300
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:16,383
who started
blow-jobbing to get crack.
His name is Marvin Johnson.. .

301
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:20,253
Mom, anonymous.
You keep.. . lt's no names.
Okay, okay.

302
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,589
Forget it.
Marvin J. Whatever.

303
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,263
Too late.
Well, he became
a gay prostitute.

304
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:27,665
And he realized that
he had hit his bottom.

305
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,295
And l have been thinking,
honey,

306
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:33,238
that maybe this
is your bottom.

307
00:15:33,442 --> 00:15:37,139
l'm telling you,
hitting bottom
is a good thing.

308
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,974
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

309
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,877
Because there's
nowhere to go but up.

310
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,382
Right?
Yep. That's what you say.

311
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:44,675
Yeah, a positive message.
Yeah.

312
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,850
Yeah. Thanks for
the pep talk, Mom.

313
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,014
Honey. Anytime, anytime.

314
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,820
All right. l guess l'm
going to Lillian's party
by myself, then.

315
00:15:52,394 --> 00:15:54,225
Don't talk to me
about being by yourself.

316
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,626
l go everywhere
by myself.

317
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:58,256
Thanks to that
new whore, Barb.

318
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:00,130
Mom, come on.
No, l don't like to say it.

319
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,032
They've been
married 12 years.

320
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,967
Okay.
But she's still a whore.

321
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:07,530
l'm sure she greets
him in the evening,
beaver first.

322
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:11,623
l don't want to
think about that.

323
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:14,760
l bet she got that car
by giving your dad
something sexually.

324
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,997
'Cause there was
one thing l would
never do,

325
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,539
and l'm sure Barb
is a champion at it.

326
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,732
l don't want to know.

327
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,742
lt's called
a ''chicken coop.' '
Of course it is.

328
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:23,709
You start at the back
and you peck your way

329
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:25,177
to the front like
you have a beak.

330
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,511
And then you end up
with two eggs
in your mouth.

331
00:16:30,285 --> 00:16:31,343
That's gross.

332
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,079
Well, l'm sure
your dad likes it.

333
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:35,452
Of course,
he grew up on a farm.

334
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,524
Okay.

335
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:38,720
You sure you don't want
to move in with me?

336
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:42,256
Mom, thanks,
but no way.

337
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:43,795
No way in hell.
Yeah?

338
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:44,866
No, thanks.

339
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,356
Think about it.
Okay.

340
00:16:48,152 --> 00:16:48,846
You don't need
your own place.

341
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:50,079
Yeah, l kind of do.
Okay.

342
00:16:50,188 --> 00:16:51,155
All right,
l'm going to go.
All right.

343
00:17:13,211 --> 00:17:14,610
Holy shit.

344
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,276
Ohh. Valet. Perfect.

345
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,754
Sorry.
Needs a wash.

346
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,962
You have to
punch it a few times.

347
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,037
Annie!

348
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:49,977
Oh, my God!

349
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,973
Oh, my God,
Lillian.
l know.

350
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:55,175
This is your
engagement party.
lsn't that crazy?

351
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:56,913
lt's so beautiful.

352
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,989
l can't believe
Dougie's boss
is a member here.

353
00:17:59,156 --> 00:18:02,648
l know,
and his parents, too.
And Dougie, l guess.

354
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:04,958
Gosh, and me,
l guess, too, now.

355
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,964
Come on, let's go
say hi to the rest
of the bridal party!

356
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:10,659
You remember
my cousin Rita?

357
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,799
Rita.
Annie.

358
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,662
l haven't seen you
since you
graduated high school.

359
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:18,033
She has
three kids now.

360
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,268
Three boys.
LlLLlAN: They're so cute.

361
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:23,002
They are cute,
but when they
reach that age,

362
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:24,475
they are disgusting.

363
00:18:24,582 --> 00:18:26,482
They smell,
they are sticky,

364
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:28,649
they say things
that are horrible,

365
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:31,779
and there is semen all
over everything, okay?

366
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,448
Disgusting.

367
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,625
l cracked
a blanket in half.

368
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,452
Do you get where
l'm going with that?
l do.

369
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:38,722
l cracked it
in half.

370
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:40,056
What?

371
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,798
LlLLlAN: Annie,
this is Becca,
my friend from work.

372
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,889
We are in
the trenches together.

373
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,093
Hey. lt's great
to meet you.
Hey, how are you?

374
00:18:45,336 --> 00:18:46,428
Nice to meet you.

375
00:18:46,604 --> 00:18:47,730
This is my husband,
Kevin.

376
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:48,998
Hi.
''Husband.' '

377
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,300
l like to say it.
We are newlyweds.

378
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:51,632
Wow. Congratulations.

379
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:52,867
Thank you so much.

380
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:55,571
We went on
a sweetheart honeymoon.
Oh.

381
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:57,943
Where did you guys go?

382
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,414
Disney World.
Disney World.

383
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:00,848
We finish each
other's sentences.
Sorry.

384
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:06,583
Sorry.
ls this your husband?

385
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,357
No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,156
l don't know him.
l'm sorry.

387
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,998
Do you want to go
for a walk later?

388
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:16,693
Oh. l can't.

389
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:18,963
All right.
l can't. l'm sorry.

390
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,359
l'm so sorry.

391
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:22,530
l'm not with anybody.
l'm here solo.

392
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:26,604
Let's start it again.
l'm Becca.
Rewind.

393
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:29,680
This is my husband.
You don't have a husband.

394
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:31,774
Sorry.

395
00:19:31,882 --> 00:19:34,680
And this is
Dougie's sister, Megan.

396
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:35,843
Hey.
ANNlE: Hi.

397
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,420
My grandma is not
supposed to have wine.
l'll be right back.

398
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,450
Hey.
Hey. How is it going?

399
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,496
lt's going great.
lt's going great.
l'm on the mend.

400
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:48,394
l just got some
pins in my legs.

401
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,599
Believe it or not,
pins in my legs,
l can still do this. Right?

402
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,137
l fell off a cruise ship,
but l'm back.

403
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,763
Oh, shit.
Yeah, ''Oh, shit.' '

404
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,501
Yeah, ''Oh, shit.' '

405
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:03,043
Took a hard,
hard, violent fall.
Kind of pinballed down.

406
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:05,308
Hit a lot of railings,
broke a lot of shit.

407
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:08,450
l'm not going to
say l survived,
l'm going to say l thrived.

408
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,544
l met a dolphin down there.

409
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,856
And l swear to God,
that dolphin looked
not at me,

410
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,118
but into my soul.

411
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:16,887
lnto my goddamn soul, Annie.

412
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:19,628
And he said,
''l'm saving you, Megan.' '

413
00:20:20,064 --> 00:20:24,296
Not with his mouth,
but he said it,
l'm assuming, telepathically.

414
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:29,001
We had a connection
that l don't even
know if l can.. . Jesus.

415
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,676
Hey, shut my mouth.
Look at.. . Unbelievable.

416
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:34,904
You must be Annie's fella.

417
00:20:35,646 --> 00:20:37,170
l'm Megan.
lt's a pleasure.

418
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,343
He's not.. .
l'm not.. . He's not.. .
l'm not with him.

419
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:41,883
Sorry.
All right.

420
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:45,181
l'm glad he's single,
because l'm going to
climb that like a tree.

421
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:49,354
Okay. You have
to meet Helen.

422
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,087
There she is. Helen.

423
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,196
LlLLlAN: Come here!

424
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:02,435

425
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,507

There she is.
Maid of honor.

427
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,671
So lovely to meet
Lillian's childhood friend.

428
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:12,542
You are so pretty.

429
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,680
You are so cute!
You are so sweet.

430
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:20,756
Helen is married
to Dougie's boss,
Mr. Harris. Perry.

431
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:22,723
Perry. And they
are so close now,

432
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,522
they are literally
joined at the hip.

433
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:26,391
Which is good,
because so are we.

434

436
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:34,596
Well, excuse me,
l better go check on
the hors d'oeuvres.

437
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,400
But it was great
to finally meet you.

438
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:38,208
lt's a great party.

439
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:39,606

Bye.
HELEN: Bye.

441
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:45,404
She's great, isn't she?

442
00:21:45,683 --> 00:21:47,150
She's awesome.

443
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:51,848
LlLLlAN'S DAD: <i>And l really</i>
<i>look forward to having</i>
<i>Doug as part of our family.</i>

444
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,156
So much so
that you two should
get married right now

445
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:55,691
and save me
a shitload of money.

446
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,417
Dad.

447
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:01,361
Everybody always
laughs at that,
but l'm not joking.

448
00:22:03,768 --> 00:22:04,757
l'm not joking.

449
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:06,637
Anyway, l want
to thank all of you
for coming.

450
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:09,504
Anyway, l want

Annie?

Umm. Hi.

Thank you, Annie.
That was so sweet.
Thank you.

466
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:54,573
Lil, remember that trip
we took to
Miami with the boys?

467
00:22:55,653 --> 00:22:57,382
And they were
working the entire weekend,

468
00:22:57,488 --> 00:23:00,048
and we just sat
and drank wine
and ate peanut brittle.

469
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:04,059
And l shared things with you
that l've never
shared with anyone.

470
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:09,332
And you made me realize
how l can trust people again.

471
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,357
So let me just say,

472
00:23:12,403 --> 00:23:14,701
Lillian,
you are my best friend.

473
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,774
And l'm
so proud of you.

474
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:22,302
Sorry. And, Dougly.. .

475
00:23:22,613 --> 00:23:24,478
l'm sorry, inside joke.

476
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:29,382
You better not
keep my Lil on a leash

477
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,351
because l still
need my drunken
Saturday nights

478
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:33,582
at Rockin' Sushi, okay?

479
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,687
Everybody raise your glasses
to the couple of the decade,

480
00:23:40,064 --> 00:23:41,656
Doug and Lillian.

481
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:50,469
Have a great night.
Dessert wine is out.

482
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:53,065
Dessert wine, yummy.
Excuse me.

483
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:55,245
Umm.. .

484
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,671
l just wanted to
say really quick that

485
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:02,274
you are so special
to me, because.. .

486
00:24:02,386 --> 00:24:05,321
Well, one of the reasons is
because l've known you
my whole entire life.

487
00:24:06,123 --> 00:24:09,388
And you've really
helped shape who l am.

488
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:13,823
l just want to thank you
for carefully selecting me

489
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:15,660
as your maid of honor.

490
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:18,633
l know you had
some other choices,

491
00:24:19,503 --> 00:24:22,097
but you are like my sister,
and l love you.

492
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,964
Well, that concludes
the speeches for the night.

493
00:24:25,342 --> 00:24:27,071
Thank you.
One last thing.

494
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,442
lt's rare to meet
someone as an adult
who you really connect with,

495
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:31,605
and that's you, Lil.

496
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:34,348
l went to Thailand recently
with my husband, Perry,

497
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:37,784
and there is
a beautiful saying
that l learned there.

498
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:47,727
lt means,
''You are a part of me,

499
00:24:48,332 --> 00:24:50,323
''a part that l could
never live without,

500
00:24:50,434 --> 00:24:54,234
''and l hope and l pray
that l never have to.' '

501
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,545
And that's it for tonight.
Thank you for coming.

502
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:03,840
Really quick,
Thank you all for coming.

503
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:05,540
l just wanted to
say really quick.. .

504
00:25:05,716 --> 00:25:07,308
Dessert wine is out.
Consuelo?

505
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,749
Really quick.
Speaking of Consuelo,

506
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:13,118
Lillian and l took
Spanish together in school.

507
00:25:13,657 --> 00:25:17,058
And so, l would just
like to say to you,
and to everyone here.. .

508
00:25:39,249 --> 00:25:40,944
Thank you.

509
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:43,918
Thank you.
l feel so close to you
and can trust you.

510
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,319
You are my
angel and soul mate.

511
00:25:46,423 --> 00:25:51,520
And l feel l can
communicate with you
with simply a look.

512
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:56,465
Thank you for coming.

513
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,967
Here, l'll take that.
l'll take that.

514
00:26:00,571 --> 00:26:02,095
Yep, l got it.

515
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,167
Lillian.. .

516
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:16,951
<i>Keep smiling, keep shining</i>

517

519
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,290
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

520
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:27,557
<i>ln good times and bad times</i>

521
00:26:27,731 --> 00:26:28,891

00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:31,832

523
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:34,869

524
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:36,633
<i>That's what friends are for</i>

525

<i>That's what</i>
<i>friends are for</i>

526
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:53,783
LlLLlAN: Man,
engagement parties rule.

527
00:26:54,158 --> 00:26:55,819
lt made me feel awesome,

528
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,588
like l can go out
and catch another
dude to marry.

529
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:04,431
So, what's up with her,
anyway? With Helen?

530
00:27:05,436 --> 00:27:06,801
What?
l'm just like.. .

531
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,638
l don't know.
She's in your wedding

532
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:10,866
and you've only
known her eight months,
though, right?

533
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:12,904
Come on.
Get it out,
get it all out.

534
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:18,710
l'm just.. .
Like, the whole gown,
and the.. .thing.

535
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:20,647
lt's just weird, right?
You know what?

536
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:23,083
She's actually
really cool, Annie.

537
00:27:23,187 --> 00:27:25,485
She's really.. .
She's a good one.
l'm telling you.

538
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:28,916
Well, l'm sure if you
like her, l will like her.

539
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,485
You have to just
get to know her.

540
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:33,358
Yeah.
Which l think
you really should.

541
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:35,295
And.. . Will you
just do me a favor?

542
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:36,866
Would you just hang
out with her once,

543
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:38,501
just the two of you.
All right?

544
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:40,160
As a favor to me.

545
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,396
Okay, l will.

546
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:43,664
l love you, Annie Lou.
l love you, too.

547
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:44,763
Bye.
Bye.

548
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:47,202
Oh. Hi, l'm Helen.

549
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:50,075
You live in Milwaukee?
l'm sorry.

550
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:52,713
Have you met Lillian?
She's my best friend.

551
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:54,647
Yeah, l know.
We've only known each other
for five minutes.

552
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:56,010
Oh! Oh!

553
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:02,956
Oh! Cute.

554
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,452
No. No. Come on.

555
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:15,332
See? Okay?
l'm not drunk. l told you.

556
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,602
So, you are just
a terrible sober driver?

557
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,006
Ha ha. Very funny.
Can l stop walking now?

558
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,010
You can stop walking
when l tell you
to stop walking.

559
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:23,511
Hey, look.
lf l was drunk,

560
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,241
would l be able to do this?

561
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,230
Stop it. Stop it.
Please, stop.

562
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:48,031
Please, stop.
l believe you.
You are not drunk.

563
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,870
But l'm still gonna
have to give you a ticket.

564
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:51,471
What? Why?

565
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:54,635
lt's a funny thing
about brake lights.
You have to have them.

566
00:28:55,012 --> 00:28:57,776
l knew it.
God, those have
been out for a year.

567
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,573
l'm so stupid.

568
00:28:59,683 --> 00:29:00,911
Look, please.

569
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:03,277
Please, l promise
l will get them fixed.

570
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:08,083
This week, l promise.
Please. Do you have
to give me a ticket?

571
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:12,554
Yes. License
and registration,
please.

572
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:21,197
Thanks.

573
00:29:23,006 --> 00:29:25,372
Look at that,
you live on
Wynnewood Drive.

574
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:26,806
Yep.
We are neighbors.

575
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:29,370
l just live
over on Ashley.
Ahh.

576
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:32,745
l used to work on Ashley.

577
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,976
You did? Where?

578
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:39,886
l had a bakery
on the main part
of the street there.

579
00:29:41,225 --> 00:29:42,988
Oh. Cake Baby.

580
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:46,821
You are Cake Baby!
Yeah!

581
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:49,893
Yeah, you had your sign.
lt was your face.

582
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:51,829
Yeah!
That was you?

583
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:52,924
That was me.

584
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:55,332
You made good cakes.

585
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,129
Thanks.

586
00:29:58,242 --> 00:30:01,336
You used to make these
little pastry things,

587
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:05,176
and you'd put
something in them,
like a cream or a custard.. .

588
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:06,605
Cream puffs.

589
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,981
Cream puffs,
that's what you call them.
Delicious.

590
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,681
l used to get served
by this tall, broad guy,

591
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,280
with, like, a wormy face.

592
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:18,086
Yeah, that was my boyfriend.

593
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:21,653
Sorry.
No, no. lt was.. .

594
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:25,030
He was my boyfriend,
and then he left me

595
00:30:25,135 --> 00:30:28,764
when the business
went under. So, anyway.. .

596
00:30:28,872 --> 00:30:30,362
You're kidding?

597
00:30:31,742 --> 00:30:33,107
What a dick.

598
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:36,278
l'm glad
l never tipped him.

599
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:42,777
You know what?
Let's forget about this.

600
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,585
Let's just
forget this one.
Really?

601
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:47,316
Under one condition.
What? What?

602
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:48,516
Get your
taillights fixed.. .

603
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,490
l promise.
l promise l will.
l promise. Thank you.

604
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:51,686
...before you kill someone.

605
00:30:51,862 --> 00:30:52,954
l'm not going to
kill anybody.

606
00:30:53,063 --> 00:30:54,496
All right.
Here, there's your lD.

607
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:56,098
And l'm going
to give you this.

608
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,793
lt's a buddy of mine.
He has a body
shop in Milwaukee.

609
00:30:58,902 --> 00:31:00,563
He'll fix those
right up for you.

610
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:03,032
Bill Cozbi?

611
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:04,569
Yeah, with a ''Z.' '

612
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:06,837
Different guy.
Yeah.

613
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:09,309
And don't mention
the whole ''Bill
Cosby'' thing to him.

614
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,813
lt drives him nuts.
l mean it.

615
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:14,213
Okay, l get it. Thanks.

616
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:17,116
You know what?
lf you mention my name,
that l referred you,

617
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,017
he'll give you
a particularly
good deal.

618
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:21,249
My gosh. Thank you.

619
00:31:21,358 --> 00:31:23,553
l really appreciate it.
Thanks.

620
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,254
Okay. Well,
l appreciated your cakes.

621
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:28,126
So, we are even.

622
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:30,358
That's me, there.
Rhodes. Officer Rhodes.

623
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,593
That's really
nice of you.

624
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:37,467
Thank you.

625
00:31:37,574 --> 00:31:39,064
We are not all bad.

626
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:40,404
What?

627
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,875
l was just saying,
we are not all bad!

628
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:43,544
Oh. Yeah.

629
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:46,309
Actually, the rest of
them are, but not me.

630
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,906
l'm the best of them.

631
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:49,311
Okay. Thank you.

632
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,247
Anyway.

633
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:52,744
Thank you.

634
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:43,831
l didn't know
you played tennis.

635
00:33:43,934 --> 00:33:45,799
Yeah, l played
a little in
high school.

636
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:47,696
l'm so glad we
were able to do this.

637
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:50,166
l'm really glad we
could do this, too.
lt's nice we get to hang out.

638
00:33:50,273 --> 00:33:51,467
l know, right?
Yeah.

639
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:53,440
lt's too bad
Lillian couldn't play
with us today.

640
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,669
Poor thing, she is so busy.

641
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,005
Ohh. l know.

642
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,807
But she's not really
that into sports.

643
00:33:59,082 --> 00:34:00,447
Even when we were little,
she didn't like anything

644
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,915
that was too competitive.

645
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:05,019
She certainly enjoys
playing tennis now.

646
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:06,816
lt's funny how
people change, isn't it?

647
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:10,193
Yeah. l mean, l don't know.
Do people really change?

648
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:11,850
l think they do.

649
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:15,222
Yeah, but, l mean,
they still stay
who they are, pretty much.

650
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,863
l think we change
all the time.

651
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:22,429
l think we stay the same,
but grow,
l guess, a little bit.

652
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,969
l think if you are growing,
then you are changing.

653
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:28,408
But, l mean, we are changing
from who we are,
which we always stay as.

654
00:34:28,512 --> 00:34:30,002
Not really,
l don't think so.

655
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,704
l think so.
l don't.

656
00:34:33,016 --> 00:34:34,506
Annie! These are my kids.

657
00:34:34,618 --> 00:34:36,415
Step-kids.
Step.

658
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:39,611
They are so hilarious.

659
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:40,813
Funny.

660
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:43,654
Excuse me,
my husband's kids.

661
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,152
HELEN: What are
you guys up to?

662
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:46,420
Going to the snack bar.

663
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,395
Awesome. You need
a ride home later?

664
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:50,131
Fuck off, Helen.

665
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,763
Okay. Put a quarter
in the swear-jar.

666
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:56,569
Good to see you.

667
00:34:56,673 --> 00:34:57,662
They are so cute.

668
00:34:57,841 --> 00:34:58,865
Sweet kids.

669
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:32,098
Carol!

670
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:33,969
Get your shit together, Carol!

671
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:47,880
Yes!

672
00:35:50,427 --> 00:35:53,863
l've seen better
tennis playing in
a tampon commercial.

673
00:35:58,368 --> 00:35:59,335
Umm.. .

674
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:01,700
l've been thinking, and.. .

675
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:04,566
Brynn needs to start
paying rent. That's it.

676
00:36:04,674 --> 00:36:05,971
She's been here
long enough.

677
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:08,977
The three of us live here,
it's not fair for
me to be paying half.

678
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,647
We split it three ways.
What do you say?

679
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:14,216
Well, she can't work.
She's on a tourist visa.

680
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:16,945
Yeah. So, technically,
l'm only allowed to tour.

681
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:18,315
Well, you know.. .

682
00:36:18,488 --> 00:36:19,750
l have no way
of earning money,

683
00:36:19,856 --> 00:36:22,484
unless l just
go and prostitute
down on the street.

684
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,287
l don't want you
to do that, no.

685
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:26,156
''Hello, fellas.
Here l am.' '

686
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,661
Yeah, but we.. .
''Put your American sausage

687
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:29,231
''in my English McMuffin.' '

688
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:30,424
No, we did that.
All right.

689
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,865
Okay, l don't even know
what you're
talking about anymore.

690
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,832
There's three
people living here.
Yeah.

691
00:36:34,938 --> 00:36:36,803
lf she doesn't
start paying.. .

692
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,032
BRYNN: l'm not.
...she has to leave.

693
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:39,898
ls this about
the diary again?

694
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,068
What diary?

695
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,006
Your diary proved
very interesting to read.

696
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:46,179
You read my.. .
You read my journal?

697
00:36:46,282 --> 00:36:49,445
At first, l did not know
that it was your diary.

698
00:36:49,552 --> 00:36:52,578
l thought it was
a very sad,
hand-written book.

699
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,551
What? That does not
make any.. .

700
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,386
But, because of
the deep personal details

701
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,928
and the bits that
mentioned Gil and Brynn.. .
ANNlE: No, no, no, no.

702
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:01,723
Don't read my journal!
GlL: And the crumbs.

703
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:03,059
Then.. .
Don't go in my room!

704
00:37:03,166 --> 00:37:07,262
Well, hello! l think,
before you make
those sort of demands,

705
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,667
you need to,
maybe, think about

706
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:10,135
putting a note on
your door saying,

707
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:13,504
''Do not come into my room,
read my diary and
wear my clothes.' '

708
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:26,547
BECCA: Wow, l've never been
to this part of town before.

709
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,081
Look, you can get
your checks cashed
next door.

710
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:30,625
l know it looks
a little scary
on the outside,

711
00:37:30,727 --> 00:37:33,025
but the food
is really good,
authentic Brazilian.

712
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:35,593
ANNlE: l'm telling you,
this is where
Brazilians come to eat.

713
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,030
l got to say, Annie's
really good at this.

714
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,760
She always drags me
to the weirdest places

715
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:40,596
and the food is
always incredible.

716
00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:42,399
And plus, you get
a lot for your money, too.
So that's good.

717
00:37:44,015 --> 00:37:44,982
All right.
Let's do it.

718
00:37:45,082 --> 00:37:46,777
Let's do it.

719
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:48,818
Somebody likes
Brazilian food.

720
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:54,617
To my bridesmaids.

721
00:37:54,725 --> 00:37:56,454
Cheers.
ALL: Cheers.

722
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:58,661
Cheers to Lil!

723
00:37:58,763 --> 00:38:02,756
This is such a stone-cold
pack of weirdos,
and l'm so proud.

724
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:05,062
And l just want to toast
all of you ladies.

725
00:38:05,169 --> 00:38:06,727
l'm so happy to
get to know you guys,

726
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:09,738
and happy to say
that l have four
new friends.

727
00:38:10,107 --> 00:38:11,597
Absolutely. Cheers.

728
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,640
So, Annie,
do you have a date
for the wedding?

729
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:16,780
Um.. .

730
00:38:18,115 --> 00:38:21,551
l don't.. . l don't think
l'm bringing anybody,
l guess.

731
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,916
Please, can l
set you up? Please?

732
00:38:24,055 --> 00:38:26,489
Annie, you can't go
to the wedding alone.
Please?

733
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,717
lf you go alone,
people might think
you're a prostitute.

734
00:38:28,826 --> 00:38:29,952
Maybe.

735
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:32,386
l'm sorry.

736
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:39,132
l hope that you're all hungry
for <i>churrasco Brasil.</i>
What would you like?

737
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:40,800
Yeah, l'll have
some of that, please.

738
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:41,963
l'll start with this.

739
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,541
l'd say yes.
Hello, chicken.

740
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:46,405
This is crazy
good, ya'll.

741
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:48,378
Helen, aren't you
eating any meat?

742
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:52,877
lt's not good
to eat a big meal
before a fitting.

743
00:38:52,983 --> 00:38:54,314
l feel a bit
bloated, so.. .

744
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,407
Not me.

745
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:57,714
HELEN: No?
No. Physically,
l don't bloat.

746
00:38:58,656 --> 00:38:59,953
Lucky.
That is lucky.

747
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,019
lt's a gift.

748
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:05,889
l can't wait to be married
for as long as you've been
married.

749
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:07,122
And to have kids.

750
00:39:10,367 --> 00:39:11,959
And be a mom.
Becca?

751
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:14,128
Yeah?

752
00:39:14,238 --> 00:39:16,399
The other night,
l'm slaving away,

753
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:18,600
making a beautiful
dinner for my family.

754
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:22,069
My youngest boy
comes in and says
he wants to order a pizza.

755
00:39:22,346 --> 00:39:24,007
l said, ''No, we're not
ordering pizza tonight.' '

756
00:39:24,115 --> 00:39:26,583
He goes,
''Mom, why don't you go
and fuck yourself?''

757
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:28,415
He's nine.

758
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:31,418
Okay, now that Lillian's
in the bathroom,

759
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:33,854
l just wanted to
talk to you guys
about the shower really quick.

760
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:37,359
l was thinking
it could be French-themed,

761
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,951
since she's always
wanted to go to Paris
her whole life.

762
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,138
So l figured we
could bring Paris here

763
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:47,308
and have champagne
and little cookies.

764
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,886
They'd say ''Lillian
and Dougie'' on them.

765
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,544
We can dip them in
chocolate fondue,

766
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:53,284
and get cheese from
the nice part of the store.

767
00:39:53,726 --> 00:39:55,193
l love that.
Good idea, Annie.

768
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:57,285
We can have
French invitations,
the whole thing.

769
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,488
Don't you think
that'd be nice?

770
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,565
That's adorable!
That's really cute.

771
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,327
Good. Great.

772
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,095
l don't know.
lt's really cute.

773
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:06,171
But l feel like,
personally, the Paris theme's

774
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,329
a bit,
''Been there, done that.' '

775
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,802
l just feel
like we can top it.

776
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,239
We should throw
some ideas around.

777
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:13,538
See if anyone else
has a theme they had in mind

778
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,169
or something
they'd been thinking of.

779
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,512
What about
a Pixar-themed shower?

780
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,477
And we all come dressed
as our favorite
Pixar character.

781
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:24,952
That, and l'll just
snowball on top of that,
also <i>Fight Club.</i>

782
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,682
Female fight club.

783
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:30,761
We grease up,
we pull in.

784
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:34,492
Lillian doesn't know,
so it's, ''Surprise!
We're going to fight!''

785
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,258
We beat the shit out of her.

786
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,626
She's not going
to forget that.

787
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,768
We just fucking attack.

788
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,036
Can l be honest?
No.

789
00:40:43,142 --> 00:40:46,305
l'm at home with
three boys all day,
every day.

790
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:47,709
What about
the bachelorette party?

791
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,206
That's what's more important.

792
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,809
l've got a new tube top,
l want to cut the tags off.

793
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:53,817
l'd like to take
advantage of this opportunity.

794
00:40:54,353 --> 00:40:56,150
Where are we going?
MEGAN: l'm going
to second her.

795
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:57,847
We'd better
blow this shit out.
Yeah.

796
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,584
That poor girl, Lillian,
who we're all here for,

797
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:03,058
is in the bathroom
probably bawling her
fucking eyes out.

798
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:05,227
Because she's realizing,
''Holy shit!

799
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,059
''l've got to spend
the rest of my life
with Doug.' '

800
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:10,294
He's my brother. l love him.
But he is a fucking asshole.

801
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:12,097
l think we can all
agree on that, right?

802
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,536
We can.. .
We'll figure it out.

803
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:18,075
l mean, l can think of stuff,
and it will be great.

804
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:20,372
We just have to make sure
it's really, really special.

805
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:28,015
Belle en Blanc?
This is the place.
Great job, Annie.

806
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,747
Thanks.
Annie.

807
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,221
<i>Belle en Blanc.</i>
<i>Reservation name?</i>

808
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:38,160
l don't have one.
We're just here to shop,
just to try on some dresses.

809
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:39,890
<i>Okay. Well, the next</i>
<i>available appointment</i>

<i>Absolutely no walk-ins.</i>

812
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,498
Whitney? lt's Helen.

813
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:47,262
<i>Helen Harris?</i>
Yeah!

814
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:48,396
<i>Hi!</i>
Hi.

815
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,372
<i>Oh, my God. Hi. Listen,</i>

Great, thanks.
<i>Okay.</i>

817
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,113
Hello. Welcome, come in.

818
00:41:56,215 --> 00:41:57,307
You look wonderful.
Great to see you.

819
00:41:57,416 --> 00:41:59,350
Welcome to Belle
en Blanc, ladies.

820
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,214
Welcome to heaven.
LlLLlAN: Thank you.

821
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,617
MEGAN: Oh, man!

822
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:06,617
This is some
classy shit here.

823
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,386
Jesus, Megan!

824
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:09,961
l'm sorry,
l want to apologize.

825
00:42:10,062 --> 00:42:13,327
l'm not even confident
on which end that came out of.

826
00:42:13,432 --> 00:42:15,457
Whitney, back to you.
l'm sorry.

827
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:18,593
Anyway, take a look around.
Get to know the dresses.

828
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,403
lf you need anything,
l'll be in my office.

829
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:21,997
Have fun.

830
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,905
Oh, my God.

831
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,775
lt's a Fritz Bernaise.

832
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,037
Ladies, l.. .
Oh, my God!

833
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:30,547
l just don't think
we can do any better.
This is.. .

834
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,583
This is beautiful.
That is gorgeous.

835
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,379
lt's unique,
it's special, it's couture.

836
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,181
This is made in France.

837
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:38,084
Helen, this is $800.

838
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,953
Are you kidding?
lt's on sale.

839
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,150
LlLLlAN: Are you serious?
Oh, my gosh.
What a perfect combination.

840
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:43,660
HELEN: You guys,
it was meant to be.

841
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:45,127
Oh. That's nice.

842
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:49,358
There's other dresses
we should be looking at.

843
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:51,163
Nope, not that one.

844
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,805
Lillian,
Lillian, look at this one.

845
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:56,431
lsn't this pretty?
Yeah.

846
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:58,703
lt's really pretty
and sweet, and.. .

847
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,974
We don't want to
upstage Lillian
with a big fancy dress.

848
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,605
Maybe we should
just get something
kind of simple.

849
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:05,750
Oh.

850
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:09,316
Please do not worry
about upstaging me.

851
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:12,390
Because guess who
Helen is friends with

852
00:43:12,558 --> 00:43:15,550
and who's
designing my wedding dress.

853
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:18,425
Lady St. Petsois JuJu.

854
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,296
l just sent my
measurements to France, y'all.

855
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,366
RlTA: No, you didn't.

856
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:24,958
Where were you when l
was getting married?

857
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,096
Ladies, let's not decide
on this bridesmaids'
dress straight away.

858
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:29,538
Let's let
our bodies decide.

859
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:32,206
Try some things on
and have some fun, okay?

860
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,476
Yeah, let's have
some fun, girls.

861
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,546
Ladies,
start your ''engines.' '

862
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:38,806
RlTA: Oh, yeah.
BECCA: Lil, Lil.

863
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,715
LlLLlAN: Amazing.
This is so cool.

864
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,131
Ladies. Ladies,
if l may interject.

865
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:56,633
l just want to say
you all look stunning.

866
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:58,496
That's a given. Head to toe.

867
00:43:58,604 --> 00:44:01,539
But, sadly,
we need to agree on one.

868
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:04,039
Well, l mean, ladies,
you all look beautiful.

869
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,703
But l just think,
personally, the
Fritz Bernaise is just.. .

870
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:09,143
l mean.. .
lt's a Bernaise.

871
00:44:09,248 --> 00:44:11,648
HELEN: This is
one of a kind.
l just.. .

872
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:12,750
l don't think
there is a question.

873
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:13,851
No. No question.

874
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,253
There might be a question.

875
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:18,155
l might.. .
l might have a question.

876
00:44:18,257 --> 00:44:20,054
l think this
dress would look great
on everybody.

877
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,217
lt's a great color.
lt's a great length.

878
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,761
lt's fun. You can twirl.

879
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,888
You can move in it.

880
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,660
You can spread
your legs apart.

881
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,065
And it's a great price.

882
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,928
This is designer as well.

883
00:44:34,306 --> 00:44:35,534
ls anyone else hot?

884
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:36,935
lt is like an
oven in here.

885
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:40,172
Okay, well,
maybe this might
help you decide.

886
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:42,008
While you gals were
in the changing room,

887
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:46,481
l happened to rustle up
a two-year-old Lady
JuJu dress in storage.

888
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:48,246
l had Lillian put it
on so you could see

889
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,081
what you'll be
standing next to.

890
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,621
Lillian, honey.

891
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,350
My God.

892
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:56,958
Beautiful length.

893
00:44:57,129 --> 00:44:58,494
Breathtaking.

894
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:02,294
Holy shit!
You look amazing.

895
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:03,901
That's a dress.
That dress is so pretty

896
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:04,969
it makes my stomach hurt.

897
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,800
Lillian,

898
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:11,534
l don't know what to say.
You look.. .

899
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,701
Megan, are you okay?

900
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,939
MEGAN: l think.. .

901
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:23,277
My dress was
probably just tight.

902
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,685
Oh, my God.

903
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,054
You got food poisoning
from that restaurant,
didn't you?

904
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:30,623
No, l had the same thing
that she had and l feel fine.

905
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:32,327
Oh, my.. . Okay.
Oh, no.

906
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:34,031
Why is this happening?
Nothing is happening.

907
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,460
Oh, my God.

908
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:38,898
RlTA: l don't really care
which dress we get.

909
00:45:39,004 --> 00:45:41,063
lt doesn't matter to me.
l just need to get
off this white carpet.

910
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,606
Oh, God.
Okay. No,
not the bathroom.

911
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:45,404
Everybody go outside.
l'm serious!

912
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,410
There is a bathroom
across the street.

913
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:51,843
l think everybody
has the flu.

914
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,577
Shit!

915
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:59,149
l need the toilet!
l need the toilet!

916
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,892
l need the toilet!

917
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,461
No!

918
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,260
No. No, Megan.
No! No!

919
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:10,028
Look away!
Megan, no!

920
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,226
Look away!

921
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:18,836
You don't look
very well, Annie.

922
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,067
l feel fine.

923
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:25,280
Are you sure?
lt wasn't that
gray kind of lamb?

924
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:27,113
You ate a lot of
that weird chicken.

925
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:29,076
Was it that?

926
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:31,451
No. l'm.. .

927
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:32,682
l.. . l feel fine.

928
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,655
l think you'd just feel
better if you threw up.

929
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,691
l don't have.. .
l don't have to throw up.

930
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:44,424
l am so sorry.

931
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:45,503
Get away from me!

932
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:47,460
You're not sick?

933
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:48,561
No.
No?

934
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,733
ln fact, Helen, l'm hungry.

935
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,970
And l wish l had a snack.

936
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:55,201
You're hungry?

937
00:46:56,248 --> 00:46:57,681
l'm starving.

938
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:00,242
What did we eat?

939
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,485
The sink is a goner.
What are you doing?

940
00:47:03,622 --> 00:47:05,214
lt's coming out
of me like lava!

941
00:47:06,158 --> 00:47:07,489
Oh, my God.

942
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,990
Don't you
fucking look at me!

943
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,397
Hmm?

944
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:13,898
Jordan almonds.

945
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:15,333
These are great.

946
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:17,431
Thank you.

947
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,139
Better?

948
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,576
l was.. .
l was just hungry.

949
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,978
Yeah.

950
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,651
Annie, everybody
is really sick
from that restaurant.

951
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:39,981
But it wasn't
the restaurant.
No, no, no, no.

952
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,490
Lillian,
where are you going?
No.

953
00:47:41,593 --> 00:47:42,617
l need a bathroom.

954
00:47:43,662 --> 00:47:44,651
Lil!

955
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:45,730
No. No.

956
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:46,855
Lil, where are you going?

957
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,627
HELEN: Be careful.
What are you doing?

958
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:52,262
lt's happening.
lt's happening.

959
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:54,098
lt's happening.
lt's happening.

960
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:59,004
lt happened.
ANNlE: What are you doing?

961
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,475
lt happened.

962
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:04,171
No. Don't you
dare ruin that dress!

963
00:48:05,183 --> 00:48:06,673
Ohh. You're really
doing it, aren't you?

964
00:48:06,852 --> 00:48:08,376
You're really
shitting in the street.

965
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:20,492
We'll just take five
of the Fritz Bernaises.

966
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,191
Thank you, Whitney.
They really do look better.

967
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,790
Right.
Thank you.

968
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,369
You okay?

969
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,368
l crapped
my wedding dress.
l crapped.. .

970
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:38,141
l.. . l crapped
my wedding dress.

971
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,276
Lunch was fun,
though, right?

972
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,046
lt was a good time,
all the girls together.

973
00:48:45,156 --> 00:48:47,021
ls this a sign, Annie?

974
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,449
No. l'm just
going to pull over

975
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,322
really quick,
though, because.. .

976
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,428
What?

977
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:52,621
...my tire just
feels a little.. .

978
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,788
Where are you going?

979
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:54,990
My tire just feels
a little low.

980
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,964
l just want to check
my tire real quick.

981
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,724
Oh. Could l borrow
your razor, please?

982
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,201
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

983
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,630
Have a good date.
Thank you.

984
00:49:33,771 --> 00:49:37,036
ls the guy that
you're going out
with also over 40?

985
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,108
l'm not over 40.
Forget it.

986
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,835
Lift up your arm.
Point up.

987
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:45,381
Ow!
Sorry.

988
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,492
Hi.
Annie.

989
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,295
Pete?
Yeah.

990
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,419
Come on in.

991
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:01,498
All right. Thank you.

992
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:06,863
Oh. This is
my son, Tyler.

993
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,035
Hi, Tyler.
Hi.

994
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,870
These things are
always so awkward.
Yeah.

995
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,840
l'm not really a setup guy.
Me, either.

996
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,468
But Becca spoke
so highly of you.

997
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,305
She had a lot of
really nice things
to say about you, too.

998
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,473
That's nice to hear.

999
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,244
l'm going to go upstairs,
throw on a couple
of finishing touches.

1000
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,254
The babysitter's not here yet,
so just hang out with Tyler

1001
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,517
and l'll be
right back down.
Okay.

1002
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,592
Okay.

1003
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,533
So, how old are you?

1004
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,404
Do you watch movies?

1005
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,849
Are you afraid of dying?

1006
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:56,920
Hmm?

1007
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:59,251
Are you afraid of dying?

1008
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:00,991
Um.. .

1009
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:04,157
l don't know.

1010
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:09,025
l mean,
l guess everybody is.
l don't know. Why?

1011
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,134
Because my mom is
going to kill you.

1012
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,839
You're making me
uncomfortable.

1013
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,617
Your hair looks burned.

1014
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:35,825
Okay.

1015
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:40,659
Are you going to make
a baby with my father?

1016
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,634
l don't.. .
l don't know.

1017
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,933
My grandma died
where you're sitting.

1018
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,672
She died right here?

1019
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,340
Right where your
underpants are.

1020
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,679
You wanna
watch me dance?

1021
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:06,256
Sure.

1022
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,439
PETE: l can't do this.

1023
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,904
Listen to me.
l miss you so much.

1024
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,183
l'll come over right now.

1025
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:36,412
Okay, l'm not over
you yet, that's why.

1026
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,112
She's not even pretty.

1027
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:41,491
l'm not doing it.
l can't. No.

1028
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:51,731
What are you doing?
Did you eat one of those?

1029
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,860
Did you eat
one of those?

1030
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,665
l ate Saturday.

1031
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,134
Okay. Oh, boy.
You know what?

1032
00:52:58,242 --> 00:53:00,836
Something's going
to happen to you.
l don't know what it is,

1033
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,845
but something's
going to happen
to your body.

1034
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:10,083
That was fun.
Oh, my gosh.

1035
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:15,423
You know what
l was thinking?

1036
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,256
You should come with me
to Lillian's wedding, maybe.

1037
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,696
Not like that.
Not like anything serious.

1038
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,595
But just like
a fun time, you know?

1039
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:27,261
We can get dressed up,
and we can go dancing
and have a drink.

1040
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,633
lt'll be fun, right?

1041
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,037
No. l mean, l don't want to
make you have to explain

1042
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,906
to all those people
what our relationship is.

1043
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:38,804
That would suck
for you. Right?

1044
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,114
Yeah. l guess so.

1045
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,145
l'm just thinking of you.
Yeah.

1046
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,778
No, it's okay.

1047
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,154
l have someone else
l can ask, anyway. So.. .

1048
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,585
Really?
Yeah.

1049
00:53:53,379 --> 00:53:54,038
Who?

1050
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:55,340
Umm.. .
This guy, George.

1051
00:53:56,682 --> 00:53:58,309
George Glass.

1052
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,778
Okay.

1053
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,858
Who is this George?

1054
00:54:07,593 --> 00:54:11,495
He is a very hot, nice guy

1055
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,088
who likes me a lot,
and would probably
love to be my date.

1056
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,189
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

1057
00:54:16,302 --> 00:54:17,269
Mmm-hmm.

1058
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:24,200
Well, let me ask you this.

1059
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:28,144
Can this George Glass

1060
00:54:29,748 --> 00:54:32,114
do this to you?

1061
00:54:42,995 --> 00:54:44,257
Probably.

1062
00:54:45,097 --> 00:54:47,895
You know what?
lt's getting really late.

1063
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,401
You should probably go.
l'm going to miss you so much.

1064
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:12,457
Oh.

1065
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:16,650
Annie Walker.

1066
00:55:16,829 --> 00:55:17,818
Hi.

1067
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,124
Hey.
Hey.

1068
00:55:19,431 --> 00:55:21,661
What brings you
in here so early?

1069
00:55:21,767 --> 00:55:24,827
l've just had a bad night.
Boy stuff.
Ohh.

1070
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:27,562
Do you want me
to arrest anybody?

1071
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:28,640
l could do that.

1072
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:29,774
Actually.. . No.

1073
00:55:30,142 --> 00:55:33,236
Do you want to talk
to a cop about it?
We are just like priests.

1074
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:37,040
Except we can
tell everybody
about it afterwards.

1075
00:55:37,149 --> 00:55:38,138
Oh.
l won't, though.

1076
00:55:38,684 --> 00:55:39,878
Doesn't sound very inviting.

1077
00:55:41,553 --> 00:55:42,679
You want a carrot?

1078
00:55:44,656 --> 00:55:45,918
Right now?
Yeah.

1079
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:48,686
l'll share.
l've got plenty.

1080
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:50,786
Sure, l'll have a carrot.

1081
00:55:50,963 --> 00:55:52,021
Yeah?

1082
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:53,325
Okay.

1083
00:55:54,033 --> 00:55:55,967
Ohh. Yeah,
that sounds rough.

1084
00:55:57,336 --> 00:55:58,394
lt's going to
get better, right?

1085
00:55:58,504 --> 00:55:59,493
l wouldn't have
thought so.

1086
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:02,597
You know, my sister
was a maid of honor
at our cousin's wedding,

1087
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:06,269
and she found it so stressful,
her hair started falling out.

1088
00:56:06,545 --> 00:56:08,274
That's terrible.
Yeah.

1089
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,473
lt grew back,
but it was.. .

1090
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:12,483
lt was pretty gross.

1091
00:56:13,052 --> 00:56:14,383
Planning a wedding
should be fun.

1092
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:17,114
You know what?
lf l ever had a wedding,

1093
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:19,917
l'd want everybody
to be stress-free.

1094
00:56:20,025 --> 00:56:21,720
l'd like it to be
like a carnival.

1095
00:56:22,194 --> 00:56:26,255
Like, people win prizes
for guessing
the bride's weight.

1096
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:27,696
Dunk tanks.

1097
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,858
Yeah.
You know?

1098
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:30,625
Mmm-hmm.
You could have elephants,

1099
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:33,068
and the bride and groom
can walk on
a little tightrope.

1100
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:35,970
Okay, what you are
talking about there,
that's a circus wedding.

1101
00:56:36,075 --> 00:56:37,702
lt's a totally different.. .
Right.

1102
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,175
You missed it.
Yeah.

1103
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,139
Hey, you know,
instead of stressing
out about this wedding,

1104
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:45,808
you know what you
should be doing?

1105
00:56:45,918 --> 00:56:47,852
Setting up a new bakery!

1106
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,687
Hmm.

1107
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:52,320
No, l'm kind of
done with that.

1108
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,980
What?

1109
00:56:54,693 --> 00:56:56,524
l don't do it anymore.

1110
00:56:56,895 --> 00:56:58,192
All right.

1111
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:02,194
Ew.
Oh!

1112
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:03,798
You got the ugly carrot.
What?

1113
00:57:04,536 --> 00:57:06,527
There is one in every bag.
You have to eat it.
lt's good luck.

1114
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:07,696
l'm not eating this.

1115
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:08,931
Yeah! l'll eat it.

1116
00:57:09,108 --> 00:57:11,406
lt's the lucky carrot?
No, don't eat it!
Don't eat it. Don't eat it!

1117
00:57:12,444 --> 00:57:16,608
Well, don't litter!
l'll fine you.
l'm sorry.

1118
00:57:17,116 --> 00:57:18,640
You know what?
Actually,
l'm going to pick it up.

1119
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,012
lt really bothers me.
Sorry.

1120
00:57:20,119 --> 00:57:24,283
l'm sorry.
lt's just that l'm anal
about that kind of thing.

1121
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:32,797
l didn't know that
you could be a cop here
if you weren't a citizen.

1122
00:57:33,732 --> 00:57:34,790
You can't.
No?

1123
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,731
No. No, you can't.

1124
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:38,700
But they made
a special dispensation

1125
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:40,771
because l'm so
tough and strong.

1126
00:57:40,873 --> 00:57:42,306
Oh. Right.
And handsome.

1127
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:43,669
Okay.

1128
00:57:43,775 --> 00:57:45,299
You're pretty.. .
You're pretty tough.

1129
00:57:46,378 --> 00:57:48,369
l am tough.
You're tough.
You're a tough cop.

1130
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,606
Look. You're saying it,
but you're laughing.

1131
00:57:49,781 --> 00:57:50,907
No, you're.. .
You're.. .

1132
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:52,176
You didn't let
me flex that time.

1133
00:57:52,351 --> 00:57:53,511
That was unfair.
l'm really tough.

1134
00:57:53,752 --> 00:57:55,549
So am l.
No.

1135
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:57,882
Yeah. l could be a cop.

1136
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,057
You think
you could be a cop?
Yeah.

1137
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,149
Okay.
Yeah.

1138
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,092
Let's see.
You know what?

1139
00:58:04,196 --> 00:58:07,222
The sun is nearly up.
Let's go and see if
you've got what it takes.

1140
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:10,201
That's right.
Now, plant your feet.

1141
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:11,336
ANNlE: Okay.

1142
00:58:11,436 --> 00:58:12,425
Good.

1143
00:58:13,105 --> 00:58:14,572
And take aim.

1144
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:19,507
Now, put your left
hand behind your head.

1145
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:22,376
Yeah. And just
drop your left hip.

1146
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:28,052
l'm kidding. Put your
arms out straight.
Okay.

1147
00:58:28,554 --> 00:58:30,385
You want to hit the middle
of the license plate.

1148
00:58:30,489 --> 00:58:31,956
That's where you get
the most accurate reading.

1149
00:58:32,057 --> 00:58:34,116
Okay.
Okay, here we go.
You ready?

1150
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:35,215
Okay.

1151
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:39,729
Fifty-eight.
What's the speed limit?

1152
00:58:39,831 --> 00:58:41,025
Fifty-five.

1153
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:43,761
Okay, they were all right.
We'll let them go.

1154
00:58:43,869 --> 00:58:46,463
You were born
to do this.
Look at you.

1155
00:58:47,439 --> 00:58:48,770
Okay.
All right,
here we go.

1156
00:58:50,776 --> 00:58:52,368
Sixty-three.

1157
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:54,211
You are missing
some good ones here.

1158
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:57,578
People are on
their way to work.
Why ruin their day?

1159
00:58:58,283 --> 00:58:59,750
Okay, watch this. 48.

1160
00:59:01,553 --> 00:59:02,542
Forty-eight.
How did you do that?

1161
00:59:02,654 --> 00:59:03,780
lt wasn't!
Yes, it was.

1162
00:59:03,889 --> 00:59:05,288
That's never happened.
Are you serious?

1163
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:06,823
lt was 48?
Yes, 48!

1164
00:59:06,925 --> 00:59:08,552
Yeah.
l'm so impressed.

1165
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,820
l'm pretty impressive.

1166
00:59:09,928 --> 00:59:11,828
l'm very impressed by you.

1167
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:13,698
Whoa!

Whoa!

1169
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,633
Whoa!
Damn!

1170
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:18,595
That was 91 .
91?

1171
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:19,693
Yes. Can we go?

1172
00:59:19,805 --> 00:59:20,772
We can go.

1173
00:59:22,007 --> 00:59:23,031
Come on, hot dogger.

1174
00:59:25,444 --> 00:59:26,570
RHODES: Let's get that fucker.

1175
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:27,905
ANNlE: Oh, my God!

1176
00:59:29,014 --> 00:59:30,345
Oh, my God!

1177
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:42,851
...family lake house. Perfect.

Hello?

Lake house?

Yeah.

1180
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:59,607
Yeah, it's
Lillian's parents' house.

1181
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:02,202
We used to go there
all the time in the
summers and everything.

1182
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,849
<i>lt's one of...</i>
A bachelorette in a cabin?

1183
01:00:05,217 --> 01:00:07,378
Wait. Can you.. .
Hold that thought. Hold on.

1184
01:00:07,486 --> 01:00:08,475
Hello?

1185
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,888
Fucking Helen. Hello?

1186
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:12,848
Annie, it's Rita.

1187
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:14,183
Hi.

1188
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:17,558
Listen, l need a trip
that l can fantasize forever

1189
01:00:17,663 --> 01:00:19,563
so that l am able to
have sex with my husband.

1190

<i>That's why</i>

Vegas?

1192
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:24,736
Hang on. Hey!

1193

<i>Shut your filthy</i>
<i>fucking mouths! l'm sorry.</i>

l'm surrounded by savages.

1195
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:31,973
You know what?
l should probably run.
My other line is ringing.

1196
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:34,307
You know, l can get cocaine
from my hairdresser.

1197
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:36,877
Okay, bye. Hello?

1198
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:38,238
Annie.
Yeah?

1199
01:00:38,417 --> 01:00:41,477
l'm so excited.
Helen just called.
She said we can go to Vegas.

1200
01:00:41,753 --> 01:00:44,551
You know.. .
Yeah, but we have to.. .
We have to fly there, and.. .

1201
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,818
Okay, Annie, l know
you are afraid of flying,

1202
01:00:47,926 --> 01:00:50,895
<i>but l want to see Criss Angel,</i>
<i>but l'm scared.</i>

1203
01:00:51,663 --> 01:00:53,028
Which l sort of love.

1204
01:00:53,532 --> 01:00:54,760
Can you just hold on
for one second?

1205
01:00:54,866 --> 01:00:57,027
<i>Oh, sure, sure, sure. l...</i>
Thanks. Hold on.
God damn it.

1206
01:00:57,235 --> 01:00:59,135
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, Annie, it's Megan.

1207
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:00,260
Hey.

1208
01:01:00,372 --> 01:01:02,704
l just had some thoughts
about the bachelorette party.

1209
01:01:02,874 --> 01:01:04,398
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

1210
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,041
Easy-peasy. Vegas it is.

1211
01:01:07,245 --> 01:01:08,234
Helen called you,
didn't she?

1212
01:01:08,413 --> 01:01:09,971
Yeah, she got the jump on you.

1213
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,441
l want balls in my face.

1214
01:01:13,652 --> 01:01:14,880
Honestly, l think it's Vegas.

1215
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:16,918
l love puppets.
Balls.

1216
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:18,313
l guess we are undecided.

1217
01:01:48,353 --> 01:01:50,344
l feel so bad Annie's
stuck back in coach.

1218
01:01:50,555 --> 01:01:51,886
l know, l offered
to pay for her

1219
01:01:52,057 --> 01:01:53,422
so she could sit
in first class,

1220
01:01:53,525 --> 01:01:55,686
but she said no.

1221
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:56,886
She's too proud.

1222
01:01:56,995 --> 01:01:58,553
lt was nice of you to offer.

1223
01:02:01,366 --> 01:02:02,424
No carry-on, huh?

1224
01:02:03,301 --> 01:02:05,030
No.
Yeah, l noticed.

1225
01:02:05,137 --> 01:02:07,469
l noticed you
didn't put anything
in the overhead bin either.

1226
01:02:07,572 --> 01:02:08,561
And l get it.

1227
01:02:08,807 --> 01:02:12,208
l get it. l want you to know,
protect and serve

1228
01:02:12,444 --> 01:02:13,843
Air Marshal-style.

1229
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:15,505
What?

1230
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:17,615
l don't want to
infringe on your privacy, man.

1231
01:02:17,716 --> 01:02:20,082
l just.. . l really appreciate
what you do for this country.

1232
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:22,483
And l respect
the hell out of you.

1233
01:02:24,623 --> 01:02:25,647
That's great.

1234
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:28,451
l'm not an Air Marshal.
l'm going to take a nap.

1235
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,618
Awesome.
Cool.

1236
01:02:29,895 --> 01:02:32,125
l'll take the first watch.

1237
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:35,930
l'm not an Air Marshal.
You don't need
to take a watch.

1238
01:02:36,034 --> 01:02:37,194
Okay.

1239
01:02:38,203 --> 01:02:40,296
l've got the first watch.

1240
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:41,869
PlLOT: <i>Please check</i>
<i>your seatbelts</i>

1241
01:02:41,973 --> 01:02:44,100
<i>and that your seat backs</i>
<i>are in an upright</i>
<i>position before takeoff.</i>

1242
01:02:44,209 --> 01:02:45,198
Gosh.

1243
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:48,702
l am really hoping
this flight is quick,

1244
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:50,871
and we get there on
the ground safely.

1245
01:02:50,982 --> 01:02:52,006
l'm not a good flyer,
l'm sorry.

1246
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,284
l had a dream last
night that we went down.

1247
01:02:55,387 --> 01:02:58,151
Yep. lt was terrible.
You were in it.

1248
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,724
What?
lt sounds like
something's happening.

1249
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,666
Annie, what are you
doing up here?

1250
01:03:11,837 --> 01:03:13,168
You are supposed
to be in your seat.

1251
01:03:13,271 --> 01:03:14,602
l know.
l'm freaking out
a little bit.

1252
01:03:14,706 --> 01:03:17,504
Ma'am, we're still ascending.
You're gonna need to
return to your seat.

1253
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:18,937
Okay, l was just.. .

1254
01:03:19,044 --> 01:03:22,013
Annie, l have something.

1255
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,774
Take two, you'll fall asleep,
wake up and we'll be there.
Here.

1256
01:03:26,418 --> 01:03:28,784
Ma'am, you're going
to have to return to
your seat, please.

1257
01:03:29,054 --> 01:03:30,487
lt's fine.
Okay. All right.

1258
01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:32,557
STEWARDESS: Ma'am!
All right. All right.

1259
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:37,023
Oh, my God, l feel terrible.
l should be sitting
back there with her.

1260
01:03:37,128 --> 01:03:40,029
l shouldn't be up
here in first class.
l feel like such a jerk.

1261
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:42,031
Lil, this is
your weekend, okay?

1262
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,100
You are
treating yourself.
Just relax.

1263
01:03:44,336 --> 01:03:45,860
She will be fine.
She will make friends.

1264
01:03:45,971 --> 01:03:48,064
There is much more sense
of community in coach,
l promise you.

1265
01:03:48,173 --> 01:03:49,231
She'll be fine.

1266
01:03:52,644 --> 01:03:55,340
l can't believe
you've never been
with anybody else.

1267
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:57,407
Just Kevin.

1268
01:04:00,986 --> 01:04:02,419
l'm sorry. l just.. .

1269
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:05,087
Becca, l just can't
help but feel bad for you.

1270
01:04:05,524 --> 01:04:07,856
You don't even
know what you want.

1271
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:09,856
l got to know where
you keep the gun, man.

1272
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:12,460
l mean, is it ankle,
hip, lower back?

1273
01:04:12,697 --> 01:04:15,291
You don't.. .
Between the cheeks, do you?

1274
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:20,393
No, l don't stick
a gun up my butt.
That's stupid.

1275
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:21,597
l didn't say ''up.' '

1276
01:04:21,873 --> 01:04:25,434
l just knew of a guy,
that guy did a lot
of undercover work.

1277
01:04:25,744 --> 01:04:29,612
And all l know is
he had tape marks
all up and down his cheeks.

1278
01:04:30,482 --> 01:04:31,608
That can't be true.

1279
01:04:31,917 --> 01:04:34,010
People don't keep
guns up their asses

1280
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:36,553
because if you
needed to use it,
how are you going to get it?

1281
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:38,120
He cut a hole in his pocket.

1282
01:04:38,323 --> 01:04:40,120
What?
ln his back pocket.

1283
01:04:40,592 --> 01:04:41,854
You have got to get
something out of your ass

1284
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,951
and you cut a hole in
the back of your jeans,

1285
01:04:44,062 --> 01:04:45,927
you want to tell me
you can't get to something?

1286
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:49,657
l don't have a gun
for you to put up my ass
to make your point.

1287
01:04:49,768 --> 01:04:51,861
l can put my Nano.
l will show you.

1288
01:04:51,970 --> 01:04:53,335
l will.. .
lf you get me scissors,

1289
01:04:53,505 --> 01:04:54,870
l will cut
a hole in my pocket.

1290
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:59,275
And you will
never find this again
until l want you to find it.

1291
01:05:00,545 --> 01:05:04,982
Kevin can only have sex
in bed, in the dark,
under the covers,

1292
01:05:05,083 --> 01:05:06,414
only after
we have showered

1293
01:05:07,018 --> 01:05:08,383
separately.

1294
01:05:09,521 --> 01:05:11,546
And sometimes,
by the time
we are finished

1295
01:05:11,723 --> 01:05:13,782
cleaning ourselves,
he's too tired.

1296
01:05:14,726 --> 01:05:19,390
And then l pretend l'm tired,
but l'm not tired.
l'm not tired. l'm not tired.

1297
01:05:19,598 --> 01:05:22,567
That's why every girl needs
those slutty college years.

1298
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:26,362
To experiment,
get it out of your system,
find out what you like.

1299
01:05:27,138 --> 01:05:30,437
Excuse me, could l
have a glass of alcohol
when you get a chance?

1300
01:05:31,376 --> 01:05:34,209
Two double
Seven and Sevens.

1301
01:05:35,146 --> 01:05:36,613
ls that.. .

1302
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:38,942
You will like it.
lt's sweet.

1303
01:05:39,651 --> 01:05:40,618
l have to go
to the bathroom.

1304
01:05:40,819 --> 01:05:43,720
But l heard about
a woman who went to
the bathroom on a plane.

1305
01:05:43,922 --> 01:05:45,913
She got sucked
into the toilet.

1306
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:48,550
Sucked right in.

1307
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,822
Are you okay?

1308
01:05:52,998 --> 01:05:54,124
Yes.

1309
01:05:54,332 --> 01:05:57,768
Yeah, l just think
that what you gave me
didn't really do anything.

1310
01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:01,461
l just have too much adrenalin
or something. But, thanks.

1311
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,868
Why don't you take
my scotch?

1312
01:06:05,076 --> 01:06:07,943
lt will just give the pill
a little kick that it needs.

1313
01:06:08,146 --> 01:06:09,773
Honestly,
l do it all the time.
Yeah?

1314
01:06:09,981 --> 01:06:12,415
Yeah, and l'm much
smaller than you,
so you'll handle it.

1315
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:14,641
Well, thanks.

1316
01:06:14,853 --> 01:06:16,252
Yeah?
Okay.

1317
01:06:29,801 --> 01:06:30,859
Yummy?

1318
01:06:31,036 --> 01:06:32,128
Yeah, it's good.

1319
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:34,430
You should just toss it back.
Don't waste any more time.

1320
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:35,663
Okay.

1321
01:06:40,545 --> 01:06:41,671
Ohh. Look at that.

1322
01:06:43,848 --> 01:06:47,113
Okay, that'll do it.
That'll do it.

1323
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:49,280
So you don't even
have sex anymore?

1324
01:06:49,487 --> 01:06:51,785
No, l have sex constantly.

1325
01:06:52,123 --> 01:06:53,420
The sex is constant.

1326
01:06:53,625 --> 01:06:56,253
But he hasn't
kissed me in five years.

1327
01:06:56,461 --> 01:06:57,826
What are you doing
when you are
having sex, then?

1328
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,828
Thinking about other things
and wishing it would stop.

1329
01:07:02,667 --> 01:07:04,601
You know, sometimes
l just want to watch

1330
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:06,703
<i>The Daily Show</i>
without him entering me.

1331
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:10,105
lt's the Wet
Republic Ultra Pool.
No.

1332
01:07:10,308 --> 01:07:11,275
Are you kidding?

1333
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:12,773
What is it again?

1334
01:07:12,877 --> 01:07:14,504
HELEN: There is a bar in
the pool and a tiger.

1335
01:07:14,679 --> 01:07:16,306
LlLLlAN: What?

1336
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:18,311
HELEN: lt's crazy.
lt's Vegas at its best.

1337
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:22,008
Wait a minute.
ls this that place
that was on <i>The Real World?</i>

1338
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:24,814
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God. lt's.. .

1339
01:07:25,023 --> 01:07:27,457
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

1340
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:31,527
l'm good.
l'm so much more relaxed.
Thank you, Helen.

1341
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:36,224
l just feel like
l'm excited,
and l feel relaxed.

1342
01:07:36,434 --> 01:07:38,493
And l'm ready

1343
01:07:38,703 --> 01:07:42,298
to party

1344
01:07:42,507 --> 01:07:45,738
with the best of them!

1345
01:07:45,944 --> 01:07:50,313
<i>And l'm going to</i>
<i>go down to the river</i>

1346
01:07:50,515 --> 01:07:55,248
Wow! lt looks like somebody
is really relaxing now.

1347
01:07:55,587 --> 01:07:58,579
What are you guys
talking about up here?

1348
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:01,418
We are going to
a restaurant tonight.
l know the owner, so.. .

1349
01:08:01,626 --> 01:08:03,059
You do?

1350
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:07,022
Ohh. Helen knows the owner.

1351
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:09,100
Uhh!

1352
01:08:11,269 --> 01:08:12,395
Big whoop.

1353
01:08:12,604 --> 01:08:14,572
Let's go take a nap.
What do you say?

1354
01:08:14,773 --> 01:08:16,764
Miss, you cannot be up here.

1355
01:08:16,975 --> 01:08:19,273
Hello, grandpa.

1356
01:08:20,378 --> 01:08:22,141
l'm sorry.
l just want
to be here with

1357
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:24,076
my friends,
because l'm
with this group.

1358
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:27,080
The sign just went off.
Can't she stay up here
for a minute and just talk?

1359
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:28,274
STEWARD: Absolutely not.

1360
01:08:28,486 --> 01:08:30,386
Coach passengers
are not allowed
up here in first class.

1361
01:08:30,588 --> 01:08:31,885
lt's policy.
l'm sorry.

1362
01:08:32,123 --> 01:08:33,090
Ooh!

1363
01:08:33,324 --> 01:08:37,556
This is a very
strict plane
that l'm on.

1364
01:08:37,762 --> 01:08:39,389
Welcome to Germany.

1365
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:44,594
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,</i> asshole.

1366
01:08:44,803 --> 01:08:45,792
All right.

1367
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:46,971
Why don't you go lay down?

1368
01:08:47,172 --> 01:08:49,436
l'm going to go take a nap.
l'm tired.

1369
01:08:49,607 --> 01:08:50,631
l think it's a good idea.

1370
01:08:50,842 --> 01:08:53,970
Catch you on the flip side,
motherfuckers.

1371
01:08:55,113 --> 01:08:56,080
l'm sorry.

1372
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,205
l'm leaving.

1373
01:08:57,348 --> 01:08:58,337
Thank you.

1374
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:02,083
This should be open,
because it's civil rights.

1375
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:03,549
This is the '90s.

1376
01:09:03,755 --> 01:09:06,724
Right. lt's not.
You're in the wrong decade.

1377
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:08,586
You are.
Okay, l am.

1378
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:09,782
Thank you.

1379
01:09:10,195 --> 01:09:12,595
Holy shit.
What did you give her?

1380
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:32,205
Miss?

1381
01:09:33,985 --> 01:09:36,078
No. lt's not me.

1382
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:38,619
Yes, it is you.
Please go back
to your seat.

1383
01:09:38,823 --> 01:09:40,814
Yes, l am with him.

1384
01:09:41,025 --> 01:09:43,323
l am Mrs. lglesias.

1385
01:09:43,528 --> 01:09:44,495
No, you are not.

1386
01:09:44,662 --> 01:09:47,426
You were just out here
and you put sunglasses on.
Out.

1387
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:48,833
But l don't want to.

1388
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,366
Sir, she can
have my seat, okay?

1389
01:09:51,469 --> 01:09:53,630
Everyone should
experience first class
at least once in their lives.

1390
01:09:53,738 --> 01:09:55,968
And Annie shouldn't
miss out just because
she can't afford it.

1391
01:09:56,174 --> 01:09:57,698
No, ma'am, l'm
afraid that's not allowed.

1392
01:09:57,909 --> 01:09:59,809
Help me, l'm poor.
LlLLlAN: No, listen,

1393
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:02,673
we're a whole wedding party.
l'm the bride.
l'm getting married.

1394
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:05,714
This seat is empty.
She's obviously nervous.
We'll calm her down and.. .

1395
01:10:05,917 --> 01:10:07,509
l understand.
But Claire is right.

1396
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:09,050
Everybody,
go back to your seats.

1397
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:10,687
Okay, you especially.

1398
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:12,823
You have three seconds
to get back to your seat.

1399
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:16,117
You can't get
anywhere in three seconds.

1400
01:10:16,327 --> 01:10:17,385
Well, you'd better try.

1401
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:18,926
You are setting me
up for a loss already.

1402
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:20,019
Thank you.

1403
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,700
Whatever you say, Stove.

1404
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:25,233
lt's Steve.

1405
01:10:26,604 --> 01:10:28,333
''Stove.' '
What kind of name is that?

1406
01:10:28,539 --> 01:10:30,336
That's not a name.
My name is Steve.

1407
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:31,735
Are you an appliance?

1408
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:33,707
No, l'm a man,
and my name is Steve.

1409
01:10:33,912 --> 01:10:35,243
You are a flight attendant.

1410
01:10:35,446 --> 01:10:38,040
That's absolutely
accurate.

1411
01:10:39,951 --> 01:10:42,215
You can close that.
Thank you.

1412
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:48,419
Hey, not-Air Marshall Jon.

1413
01:10:48,626 --> 01:10:51,186
You want to get
back in that restroom
and not rest?

1414
01:10:51,396 --> 01:10:53,261
No, l have to get
back to my seat.

1415
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:56,024
Yeah, you gotta
get back on my seat.

1416
01:10:58,136 --> 01:10:59,103
You get it?

1417
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:00,737
Yeah,
l definitely
got it.

1418
01:11:00,939 --> 01:11:02,406
Oh-oh. What's that?

1419
01:11:04,575 --> 01:11:07,408
l got to get back to my seat.
Could you just
move your leg, please?

1420
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:09,079
l got to go.

1421
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:11,348
Oh-oh.
Oh-oh.

1422
01:11:11,449 --> 01:11:13,576
Somebody found a souvenir.

1423
01:11:14,118 --> 01:11:17,747
You feel that
steam heat coming?
That's from my undercarriage.

1424
01:11:18,156 --> 01:11:20,317
That can go up
and higher.

1425
01:11:20,525 --> 01:11:21,890
Okay.

1426
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:25,424
Jon, get us a blanket.

1427
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:26,961
No.

1428
01:11:27,165 --> 01:11:29,793
l got to take a whiz
and l'll be right back.

1429
01:11:30,835 --> 01:11:31,824
Cool.

1430
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:37,835
l don't want you to be
a big fuck-up like me.

1431
01:11:38,042 --> 01:11:39,339
How do you think l feel?

1432
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:42,138
Like me.
You can still
turn it around.

1433
01:11:42,347 --> 01:11:43,678
No, don't.

1434
01:11:45,016 --> 01:11:46,142
Stop it!

1435
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:49,013
You are more
beautiful than
Cinderella.

1436
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:53,424
You smell like
pine needles and you
have a face like sunshine.

1437
01:12:07,005 --> 01:12:08,131
What?

1438
01:12:11,309 --> 01:12:12,469
Oh, no.

1439
01:12:13,678 --> 01:12:15,043
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1440
01:12:15,246 --> 01:12:18,374
<i>as you can see,</i>
<i>the captain has turned on</i>
<i>the ''fasten seatbelt'' sign.</i>

1441
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,642
<i>lt appears we've run into</i>
<i>a rough patch of weather...</i>

1442
01:12:20,752 --> 01:12:21,980
ANNlE:

<i>There is a Colonial woman</i>
<i>on the wing.</i>

1446

Steve.
All right.

1447
01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:29,318
<i>There's a Colonial woman.</i>

1448

<i>She was churning</i>

Steve, get her.

1449
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:32,685

Shit!

1450
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:35,127
Everyone, remain calm!
l'm an Air Marshal.

1451
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:38,695
Yes! l knew it.
l got your back, Jon!

1452

Let's get out!
Let's open the doors
and get out!

1455
01:12:44,008 --> 01:12:46,568
<i>She is dressed in</i>
<i>traditional Colonial garb.</i>

1456

Say goodbye!
We are going down!

1457
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:50,004
Stay calm.

1458
01:12:50,114 --> 01:12:51,376
ANNlE: There is something
they are not telling us.

1459
01:12:51,482 --> 01:12:53,109
There is a Colonial
woman on the wing.

1460
01:12:53,751 --> 01:12:54,740
l will cover the pilot!

1461
01:12:59,424 --> 01:13:01,449
Who is she?
What does she want?

1462
01:13:32,723 --> 01:13:34,816
Just let me make it
up to you, please.

1463
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:37,692
l'm telling you,

1464
01:13:37,895 --> 01:13:40,523
your shower is
going to be amazing.

1465
01:13:40,731 --> 01:13:42,631
l have so many ideas.

1466
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:44,461
l want to talk to
you about the shower.

1467
01:13:44,669 --> 01:13:47,001
l feel like

1468
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:51,164
it has been really
overwhelming for you.

1469
01:13:52,009 --> 01:13:53,636
lt's just starting
to make you crazy.

1470
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:56,313
No, Lil, l'm fine.
l mean.. .

1471
01:13:57,682 --> 01:13:59,240
Lil, l'm fine.

1472
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:00,975
No, you're not fine.

1473
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:03,050
You are not fine, Annie,

1474
01:14:03,254 --> 01:14:06,280
and we need things to just

1475
01:14:07,859 --> 01:14:09,451
flow smoothly from now on

1476
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:13,096
and Helen just knows
how to do this kind of stuff.

1477
01:14:13,297 --> 01:14:15,128
She does it all the time.

1478
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:17,198
She is good at it.
She likes doing it.

1479
01:14:17,802 --> 01:14:20,270
This way you don't have to

1480
01:14:21,072 --> 01:14:24,769
plan any more
lunches or trips.

1481
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:26,773
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

1482
01:14:26,978 --> 01:14:28,275
l get it.

1483
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,777
l think it'll be
best here on out

1484
01:14:30,982 --> 01:14:33,815
for the shower
and for everything.

1485
01:14:34,318 --> 01:14:36,616
Yeah,
whatever you want.

1486
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:39,449
l mean,
it's probably best.

1487
01:14:39,657 --> 01:14:41,682
l think so, right?

1488
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:43,190
Yeah.
l just want you
to be happy.

1489
01:14:43,394 --> 01:14:45,487
l think that
will make me happy.
lt will be good.

1490
01:14:45,696 --> 01:14:47,687
Okay.
Okay.

1491
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,826
Good.

1492
01:15:13,958 --> 01:15:14,925
Hey.

1493
01:15:15,393 --> 01:15:16,360
Hey.

1494
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:18,995
Do you want to hang out?

1495
01:15:26,871 --> 01:15:28,270
ANNlE: lt's not funny!
Stop laughing.

1496
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:29,838
RHODES: lt's a little funny.

1497
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:32,805
None of those girls
are laughing, believe me.

1498
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:35,171
lt's not funny.
Have you ever been
kicked off a plane?

1499
01:15:35,379 --> 01:15:36,346
l can't say that l have.

1500
01:15:36,514 --> 01:15:37,481
Thank you.

1501
01:15:37,682 --> 01:15:41,345
All of the girls
hate me right now.

1502
01:15:41,552 --> 01:15:43,713
You are like
the maid of dishonor.

1503
01:15:46,257 --> 01:15:48,885
l hope Lillian isn't
going to be mad at me
for too long.

1504
01:15:49,093 --> 01:15:50,754
No, she will be all right.

1505
01:15:50,962 --> 01:15:52,327
l don't know,
l just wish things were

1506
01:15:52,496 --> 01:15:53,895
the way that they
used to be, you know.

1507
01:15:54,098 --> 01:15:55,861
l feel like her
life is going off

1508
01:15:56,067 --> 01:15:59,400
and getting perfect,
and mine is just like.. .

1509
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:02,570
lt will turn around,
you know.

1510
01:16:02,773 --> 01:16:04,536
l have been hearing
that for a long time.

1511
01:16:04,742 --> 01:16:06,266
lt's going to turn around.
l just know it.

1512
01:16:06,477 --> 01:16:08,035
Anyway.

1513
01:16:09,113 --> 01:16:10,239
You got to bake.

1514
01:16:10,448 --> 01:16:12,109
l don't really do
that anymore, l told you.

1515
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:13,442
Why?

1516
01:16:13,618 --> 01:16:14,778
l don't know,
it's just.. .

1517
01:16:16,587 --> 01:16:19,556
l don't know,
after it just went under,
l just, kind of,

1518
01:16:21,225 --> 01:16:22,624
stopped, l guess.

1519
01:16:22,827 --> 01:16:24,795
lt doesn't make
me happy anymore.

1520
01:16:24,996 --> 01:16:26,657
Just because you didn't
make any money at it,

1521
01:16:26,764 --> 01:16:27,788
doesn't mean that
you failed at it.

1522
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,395
l lost a lot of money.

1523
01:16:30,601 --> 01:16:32,535
All my money.

1524
01:16:32,803 --> 01:16:34,270
But you are so good at it.

1525
01:16:34,472 --> 01:16:35,905
Oh, well.
Let's change the subject.

1526
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,233
No more baking.
l'm done.

1527
01:16:38,442 --> 01:16:40,569
l don't know how
you just can't do it anymore.

1528
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:44,043
lf l wasn't a cop anymore,
l would still.. .

1529
01:16:44,248 --> 01:16:45,215
Arrest people?

1530
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:47,384
...go out with
a gun and shoot people.

1531
01:16:48,219 --> 01:16:50,687
l probably wouldn't do that.
l'm just trying to
make you feel better.

1532
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,517
You are okay, you know.

1533
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,727
You don't
know me very well.

1534
01:16:56,927 --> 01:16:59,122
l know you well enough
to know that
you're not so bad.

1535
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,922
You got some stuff.
Oh, yeah.

1536
01:17:01,132 --> 01:17:02,861
You got bits and
pieces going on.

1537
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:03,991
Thanks.

1538
01:17:04,101 --> 01:17:06,035
l have been thinking
about you a little bit.

1539
01:17:06,237 --> 01:17:07,898
About me? Really?

1540
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:09,538
There is something
about you.

1541
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:12,238
Something about
you that sticks.

1542
01:17:17,915 --> 01:17:19,712
ANNlE: l hate buttons.

1543
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,450
Where is the bedroom?

1544
01:17:27,258 --> 01:17:29,920
Sorry. lt's a mountain bike.
Are you okay?

1545
01:17:30,127 --> 01:17:31,492
Do you like mountain biking?
Uh-huh.

1546
01:17:36,133 --> 01:17:37,259
Take this off.

1547
01:17:37,468 --> 01:17:38,833
l'm so glad
this is happening.

1548
01:17:39,036 --> 01:17:40,230
So am l.

1549
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:56,943
Hello.
Morning.

1550
01:17:57,152 --> 01:17:58,676
Sorry, l didn't
mean to freak you out.

1551
01:17:58,887 --> 01:18:00,081
No, it's okay.

1552
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:02,347
l haven't been
sitting here that long.
Oh.

1553
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:08,194
Sorry, l guess l fell asleep.

1554
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:11,365
l didn't mean to sleep over.

1555
01:18:12,333 --> 01:18:13,300
Don't be silly.

1556
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:15,936
l made you a cappuccino.

1557
01:18:16,137 --> 01:18:18,435
Made it?
Yeah.

1558
01:18:19,474 --> 01:18:21,305
So, last night was fun.

1559
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:25,106
lt was.
lt was very fun.

1560
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:27,648
l had fun.

1561
01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:29,441
lt was fun.

1562
01:18:30,819 --> 01:18:33,481
lf you care to
accompany me to the kitchen,

1563
01:18:33,688 --> 01:18:35,417
the fun may continue.

1564
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:37,648
A different kind of fun.

1565
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,420
But why don't you
just get dressed
and whatever, and.. .

1566
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:42,926
l left your
clothes over there.

1567
01:18:43,097 --> 01:18:44,394
Okay.

1568
01:18:44,599 --> 01:18:45,861
And l'll see you in there.

1569
01:18:46,034 --> 01:18:47,331
Okay.

1570
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:53,568
RHODES: There she is.

1571
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,239
Your workshop awaits.

1572
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:58,309
l know it's a bit crazy,
but l popped out

1573
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:01,244
and l got a few little
baking bits and pieces.

1574
01:19:01,449 --> 01:19:02,507
Butter, milk.

1575
01:19:02,717 --> 01:19:05,242
Because l thought
that it would be fun
for us to bake together today.

1576
01:19:05,453 --> 01:19:07,250
Obviously, you will
be doing the baking.

1577
01:19:07,455 --> 01:19:09,013
l will be doing the eating.

1578
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,351
Because you are the expert.

1579
01:19:11,826 --> 01:19:13,350
Yeah, l don't.. .

1580
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:15,426
l don't really wanna.. .

1581
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,121
Sorry. You went to
all this trouble, but.. .

1582
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:20,767
Come on, l know you haven't
done it in a while,
but it'll be great.

1583
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:24,029
Don't be silly,
just get into it.
You are so good at it.

1584
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:27,603
All right. l get it.

1585
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:30,300
lt was a bit of a curve ball.

1586
01:19:30,578 --> 01:19:32,443
Yeah, l think
l'm going to go.

1587
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:36,139
l'm sorry.
l should just
probably go.

1588
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:37,707
Annie,

1589
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,445
l don't know what
you are getting
so upset about.

1590
01:19:40,655 --> 01:19:42,020
Because you don't know me.

1591
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,318
You don't know anything
about me or my life or.. .

1592
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:48,325
Well, no, because.. .
l don't know what
you're trying to do here.

1593
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:50,555
l don't need you to fix me.
To fix you?

1594
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:53,131
l don't need any help.
l mean, who do
you think you are?

1595
01:19:53,334 --> 01:19:56,030
Jesus, Annie,
we had a really good time.
And now you are being all.. .

1596
01:19:56,237 --> 01:19:58,728
lt's my fault.
l shouldn't have
come here last night.

1597
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,965
Last night was a mistake.

1598
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:02,506
Fucking hell. All right.

1599
01:20:18,526 --> 01:20:21,324
<i>Hey, it's Lillian.</i>
<i>Leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

1600
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:24,721
Hey, Lil, it's me.

1601
01:20:25,166 --> 01:20:26,133
Umm.. .

1602
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:31,534
l'm sure you're probably still
a little bit mad at me,
but l hope not.

1603
01:20:32,273 --> 01:20:36,403
Anyway, the excitement
still continues with me.

1604
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:41,576
l just slept with
a cop that pulled me over

1605
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:46,880
and l woke up today,
and he was really
sweet and nice and cute.

1606
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:50,418
So, naturally,
l ran out
as fast as l could.

1607
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,252
What's wrong with me?

1608
01:20:52,827 --> 01:20:53,816
Umm.. .

1609
01:20:53,928 --> 01:20:56,954
Anyway, l know you
are busy and stuff,

1610
01:20:57,131 --> 01:21:00,191
so just call me
when you get a chance.

1611
01:21:00,401 --> 01:21:04,531
l'd love to talk
this out with you
when you can.

1612
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:06,604
Okay, bye.

1613
01:21:14,816 --> 01:21:17,444
BRYNN: Annie! Annie, wake up.

1614
01:21:17,652 --> 01:21:19,381
lt's 11 :00 a.m .

1615
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:22,784
Oh, shit.

1616
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:24,583
You got a package.

1617
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:28,284
l'd bring it to you,
but you said,
''Don't touch my things.' '

1618
01:21:57,892 --> 01:21:59,655
<i>Please join us for</i>
<i>a Parisian brunch</i>

1619
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:01,456
<i>at the home of</i>
<i>Helen Harris lll</i>

1620
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:04,690
<i>to celebrate the marriage</i>
<i>of Lillian Donovan</i>
<i>and Douglas Price.</i>

1621
01:22:05,233 --> 01:22:10,136
<i>Let us shower Lillian</i>
<i>with gifts and love.</i>
Rיpondez s'il vous plaמt. <i>Yay!</i>

1622
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,777
Excuse me.
Oh. Hi.

1623
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:23,316
l'm looking for a birthday
gift for my best friend.
Oh.

1624
01:22:23,418 --> 01:22:25,943
l want to get her
a necklace that says,
''Best Friends Forever.' '

1625
01:22:26,754 --> 01:22:28,221
You sure you want
it to say ''Forever''?

1626
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:30,215
Yeah, why?

1627
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:32,018
Come on. ''Forever''?

1628
01:22:32,927 --> 01:22:33,916
Forever.

1629
01:22:34,028 --> 01:22:36,189
l don't think you guys
will be best friends forever.
No offense.

1630
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:37,695
But you know.. .

1631
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:39,823
The friends you have
when you are
younger sometimes.. .

1632
01:22:40,101 --> 01:22:42,126
Sometimes you grow apart
when you get older.

1633
01:22:42,236 --> 01:22:43,726
Maybe she'll find
a new best friend.

1634
01:22:43,938 --> 01:22:45,633
And maybe she
will be more
successful than you are

1635
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,935
and prettier and
richer and skinnier

1636
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:50,339
and they end up doing
everything together.

1637
01:22:51,512 --> 01:22:52,740
You are weird.

1638
01:22:53,047 --> 01:22:54,605
l'm not weird. Okay?

1639
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:56,272
Yes, you are.

1640
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,351
No, l'm not,
and you started it.

1641
01:22:57,552 --> 01:22:59,042
No, you started it.

1642
01:22:59,253 --> 01:23:01,084
Did you forget
to take your Xanax
this morning?

1643
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:02,756
God, l feel bad
for your parents.

1644
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:03,879
l feel bad for your face.

1645
01:23:04,225 --> 01:23:06,250
Okay, well,
call me when
your boobs come in.

1646
01:23:06,394 --> 01:23:08,021
You call me
when yours come in.

1647
01:23:08,196 --> 01:23:10,096
What, do you have
four boyfriends?
Exactly.

1648
01:23:10,298 --> 01:23:13,165
Yeah, okay, have fun
having a baby at your prom.

1649
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:14,857
You look like an old mop.

1650
01:23:15,069 --> 01:23:16,866
You know what?
You're not as popular
as you think you are.

1651
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:17,971
l am very popular.

1652
01:23:18,272 --> 01:23:20,206
l'm sure you are.

1653
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:21,766
Very popular.

1654
01:23:22,009 --> 01:23:23,601
Well, you're an old,
single loser

1655
01:23:23,778 --> 01:23:25,370
who is never going
to have any friends.

1656
01:23:26,214 --> 01:23:27,476
You're a little cunt.

1657
01:23:35,556 --> 01:23:36,750
l'm sorry.

1658
01:23:40,561 --> 01:23:42,620
Let me tell my mom, okay.

1659
01:23:43,264 --> 01:23:44,891
l already told her.

1660
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:46,626
Was she mad?

1661
01:23:55,476 --> 01:23:57,740
<i>Hi, Annie,</i>
<i>it's Rhodes again.</i>

1662
01:23:57,945 --> 01:23:59,344
<i>Since you're not</i>
<i>returning any of my calls,</i>

1663
01:23:59,514 --> 01:24:00,913
<i>l assume that</i>
<i>you're not interested</i>

1664
01:24:01,115 --> 01:24:03,310
<i>in spending any</i>
<i>more time with me,</i>
<i>which is fine.</i>

1665
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:06,919
<i>So don't worry,</i>
<i>l won't be bothering</i>
<i>you ever again.</i>

1666
01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:09,450
<i>Get those taillights fixed.</i>

1667
01:24:17,298 --> 01:24:21,496
We'd like to invite you
to no longer live
with us anymore.

1668
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:24,699
What? What do you mean?
l don't get it.

1669
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:27,940
The thing is,
we decided that it was
actually a bit immature

1670
01:24:28,042 --> 01:24:29,373
for a grown-up
brother and sister to

1671
01:24:29,544 --> 01:24:30,875
still be living
together with a roommate.

1672
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:33,943
At our age, it's a bit
ridiculous, isn't it?
Yeah.

1673
01:24:34,048 --> 01:24:36,141
We look a bit silly,
don't we?
Pathetic.

1674
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,409
So we are actually
going to live together alone.

1675
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,014
Without you.

1676
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:41,721
You're moving out.

1677
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:46,585
She's not moving.

1678
01:24:46,694 --> 01:24:47,922
She will move.

1679
01:24:48,129 --> 01:24:49,357
Eventually.
Eventually.

1680
01:24:49,463 --> 01:24:50,521
She has to.

1681
01:24:50,798 --> 01:24:51,856
She is taking it in.

1682
01:24:51,966 --> 01:24:53,490
You have to leave.

1683
01:24:53,701 --> 01:24:55,032
Oh! That's prickly.

1684
01:25:00,341 --> 01:25:01,865
Hi.
Hi.

1685
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:06,345
Remember when you
thought l hit bottom?

1686
01:25:07,248 --> 01:25:08,545
That wasn't bottom.

1687
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,577
Come here.

1688
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:14,252
We're gonna have fun.
l, for one,
am really glad you're here.

1689
01:25:14,755 --> 01:25:16,017
And guess what?

1690
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:18,149
Good timing.

1691
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:20,923
You know what
just came in today
on the Netflix?

1692
01:25:21,395 --> 01:25:23,488
<i>Cast Away.</i> Tom Hanks.

1693
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:25,666
lt's like <i>Forrest Gump,</i>
but on an island.

1694
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,926
Honey, you are gonna love it.

1695
01:25:56,497 --> 01:25:58,897
My God.

1696
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,833
This is her driveway?

1697
01:26:02,403 --> 01:26:04,394
Who is that man?

1698
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:10,804
Are you a guest of
Helen Harris lll?

1699
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,772
Yes. Technically. l guess.

1700
01:26:13,981 --> 01:26:15,949
An attendant will
meet you at the stables.

1701
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,376
Where?

1702
01:26:17,551 --> 01:26:18,711
The shower is over
the second bridge.

1703
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:21,753
Pink lemonade?
Thank you.

1704
01:26:21,956 --> 01:26:24,948
l don't have a cup holder.
Can l just give that.. .

1705
01:26:28,863 --> 01:26:31,957
Pink lemonade.
Nice. Nice touch.

1706
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:34,934
Shit.

1707
01:26:42,777 --> 01:26:44,972
God damn it, that's good.

1708
01:26:45,079 --> 01:26:46,046
Mmm.

1709
01:26:47,982 --> 01:26:49,779
Shit, that is fresh.

1710
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,800
GlRL 1 : This is the most
beautiful shower
l have ever been to.

1711
01:27:09,236 --> 01:27:11,704
GlRL 2: Yes, and Helen
is giving out the
cutest party favors.

1712
01:27:11,806 --> 01:27:14,639
GlRL 1 : l know,
l love their pink berets.

1713
01:27:30,257 --> 01:27:32,020
Would you like
some champagne?
Yes.

1714
01:27:32,493 --> 01:27:33,482
lt's French.

1715
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:36,594
Annie. Hey.

1716
01:27:37,031 --> 01:27:37,998
Hi.

01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,997
How are you doing?
You're here.

01:27:41,569 --> 01:27:44,003
Yeah, l'm here.

1719
01:27:44,438 --> 01:27:46,804
Of course you were invited.
l just meant you have arrived.

1720
01:27:46,907 --> 01:27:49,535
No, l was just joking.
Okay.

1721
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:52,103
Can you believe this?
lsn't it amazing?

1722
01:27:52,947 --> 01:27:54,005
Yep.

1723
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:55,739
Yeah. lt's nice.

1724
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,884

1725
01:27:58,552 --> 01:27:59,951
Are we okay?

1726
01:28:00,121 --> 01:28:01,554
Yes, l'm sorry
l haven't called.

1727
01:28:01,756 --> 01:28:04,190
l just didn't want
to bug you, but.. .

1728
01:28:04,291 --> 01:28:06,589
Forgive me.
lt just got crazy.

1729
01:28:06,694 --> 01:28:09,492
There has been lots
of organizing, and.. .
l have so much to tell you.

1730
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:12,088
l have to say hi to my aunt
or she will get mad at my mom.

1731
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:13,598
No, you gotta go do
your party rounds.

1732
01:28:13,768 --> 01:28:15,201
Yeah.

1733
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:16,529
l'll see you in a minute.

1734
01:28:16,704 --> 01:28:17,830
Yeah. Okay.

1735
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:19,700
Oh! Rita,
you got all our towels.

1736
01:28:19,807 --> 01:28:22,071
Yes, l did.
Because l love you, kitten.

1737
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:24,344
All right,
let's see what's next.

1738
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:26,503
Another one,
another one, another one.

1739
01:28:26,714 --> 01:28:30,013
l know who this is from.
l can tell by the wrapping.

1740
01:28:30,217 --> 01:28:31,548
ls that you?

1741
01:28:34,088 --> 01:28:36,386
Annie, you made this.

1742
01:28:37,425 --> 01:28:38,449
Look.

1743
01:28:38,726 --> 01:28:40,387
Oh, man.
LlLLlAN: Oh, my gosh.

1744
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:42,152
lt's us, Annie.

1745
01:28:42,763 --> 01:28:44,731
MEGAN: Oh, my God.
Let me see.

1746
01:28:46,233 --> 01:28:47,666
Oh, my God.

1747
01:28:48,669 --> 01:28:53,663
This is all my
favorite stuff from all the
stores l love in Milwaukee.

1748
01:28:53,774 --> 01:28:56,766
Annie!
This is so unbelievable.

1749
01:28:57,278 --> 01:28:58,267
Wilson Phillips.

1750
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:00,941
Man, l love Wilson Phillips.

1751
01:29:01,182 --> 01:29:03,173
We listened to <i>Hold On</i>
probably 10,000 times

1752
01:29:03,284 --> 01:29:05,013
when l got my
driver's license.

1753
01:29:05,252 --> 01:29:08,119
This is such an amazing gift.

1754
01:29:08,456 --> 01:29:09,821
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1755
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:12,585
l feel really bad, Lil,

1756
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:14,752
l didn't get a chance
to actually get you a present

1757
01:29:14,862 --> 01:29:16,853
because l have been so busy
organizing the shower.

1758
01:29:16,964 --> 01:29:19,455
Helen, please.
lt's more than enough.

1759
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:21,931
Here is a card to
say congratulations.

1760
01:29:22,036 --> 01:29:25,802
Thank you.
Gosh, you have
really outdone yourself.

1761
01:29:28,175 --> 01:29:29,540
Oh, my God, Helen.

1762
01:29:31,512 --> 01:29:33,104
WOMAN: Honey, what is it?

1763
01:29:33,848 --> 01:29:36,214
Helen's taking me
to Paris.

1764
01:29:39,019 --> 01:29:40,281
HELEN: Your face!

1765
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:41,988
l got you. l fooled you.

1766
01:29:42,089 --> 01:29:43,056
Look at your face.

1767
01:29:44,225 --> 01:29:47,353
lt's just a little
pre-wedding vacation.
And while we're there,

1768
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:49,691
we're gonna meet
the designer of her dress
and have a fitting.

1769
01:29:49,864 --> 01:29:52,355
LlLLlAN: You are
taking me to Paris?

1770
01:29:52,533 --> 01:29:55,058
Oh, my God! This is
the best present ever!

1771
01:29:55,703 --> 01:29:57,193
Thank you so much.

1772
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:58,305
HELEN: <i>ְ Paris!</i>

1773
01:29:58,472 --> 01:29:59,461
LlLLlAN: Oh, my God.

1774
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:01,264
Are you fucking kidding me?

1775
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:04,340
Annie!
No, Mom.

1776
01:30:04,445 --> 01:30:05,707
Motherfucking Paris?

1777
01:30:05,913 --> 01:30:06,902
LlLLlAN: Annie,
what are you doing?

1778
01:30:07,047 --> 01:30:10,346
l told you about Paris, Helen.
l told you about
this whole idea!

1779
01:30:10,451 --> 01:30:11,748
Annie, calm down.
ANNlE: No, Lillian!

1780
01:30:11,886 --> 01:30:14,411
What, you're gonna
go to Paris with Helen now?

1781
01:30:14,588 --> 01:30:16,647
What, you guys are
gonna ride around
on bikes

1782
01:30:16,757 --> 01:30:18,349
with berets and
fucking baguettes

1783
01:30:18,526 --> 01:30:20,153
in the basket of
the front of your bikes?

1784
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:21,387
How romantic!

1785
01:30:21,695 --> 01:30:24,994
What woman
gives another woman
a trip to Paris?

1786
01:30:25,132 --> 01:30:27,032
Am l right? Lesbian.

1787
01:30:27,268 --> 01:30:28,826
We're all thinking it,
aren't we?
l'm not.

1788
01:30:28,936 --> 01:30:31,234
Okay? Yes, we're all
thinking it, right?
l was.

1789
01:30:31,438 --> 01:30:34,236
Annie.. .
Lillian, this is not
the ''you'' that l know.

1790
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:35,738
The ''you'' that l
know would have

1791
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,207
walked in here
and rolled your eyes

1792
01:30:37,378 --> 01:30:38,845
and thought
this was completely

1793
01:30:39,013 --> 01:30:40,480
over-the-top,
ridiculous and stupid.

1794
01:30:40,581 --> 01:30:44,073
Look at this shower!
Look at that fucking cookie!

1795
01:30:44,318 --> 01:30:46,309
Did you really think
that this group of women

1796
01:30:46,487 --> 01:30:48,512
was going to
finish that cookie?

1797
01:30:48,689 --> 01:30:50,213
Really? You know what?
That reminds me, actually.

1798
01:30:50,457 --> 01:30:53,915
l never got a chance
to try that fucking cookie!

1799
01:30:55,629 --> 01:30:57,426
Stupid fucking cookie!

1800
01:31:01,101 --> 01:31:03,899
Delicious! Stupid cookie.
l think l'll.. .

1801
01:31:05,172 --> 01:31:08,141
Maybe it's better if l
dip it in the chocolate.

1802
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:16,409
ls this what
you want, Lillian?

1803
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,652
This is so awesome.

1804
01:31:24,758 --> 01:31:31,095
All right,
let's have some nice,
hot, unsanitary chocolate!

1805
01:31:38,038 --> 01:31:40,165
Ahh! lt's hot!
Jesus! God!

1806
01:31:40,274 --> 01:31:42,936
Christ, Annie.
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

1807
01:31:43,043 --> 01:31:44,874
What are you doing?
What am l doing?

1808
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:47,038
You wouldn't know,
would you?
Where have you been?

1809
01:31:47,147 --> 01:31:49,274
You would have no idea.
Let me fill you in, okay?

1810
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:52,075
Ever since you got engaged,
everything has turned to shit!

1811
01:31:52,186 --> 01:31:54,848
You know what?
This is supposed
to be about my time!

1812
01:31:55,022 --> 01:31:57,081
You have managed
to ruin every event

1813
01:31:57,258 --> 01:31:59,351
in my wedding.
Thank you very much.

1814
01:31:59,493 --> 01:32:00,790
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

1815
01:32:00,961 --> 01:32:02,292
lt's all her fault.
lt is not mine!

1816
01:32:02,429 --> 01:32:03,623
And you would know that,

1817
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,700
if you got your
beautiful haired head
out of your asshole.

1818
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,998
ln fact, out of her asshole,
which l'm sure is
perfectly bleached.

1819
01:32:11,138 --> 01:32:12,765
You know what? lt is!

1820
01:32:12,873 --> 01:32:14,135
And you know how l know?

1821
01:32:14,241 --> 01:32:16,106
Because l went to
the fucking salon with her

1822
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:18,177
and l got my
asshole bleached, too!

1823
01:32:18,512 --> 01:32:21,345
And l love my new asshole!

1824
01:32:22,283 --> 01:32:24,877
You know what?
Why can't you
just be happy for me

1825
01:32:24,985 --> 01:32:28,580
and then go home and
talk behind my back later,
like a normal person?

1826
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:32,715
l am happy for you, Lillian.
l am very happy for you.

1827
01:32:32,826 --> 01:32:36,387
l wish you well.
l won't bother
you anymore.

1828
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:40,094
Are you kidding me? Annie!

1829
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,861
Go, go, go, go, go!

1830
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:44,633
LlLLlAN: Get back here! Stop.

1831
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,831
No, no! She does
not get a party favor.

1832
01:32:49,109 --> 01:32:50,940
She does not get a dog!

1833
01:32:53,547 --> 01:32:55,139
And if you are
going to act like this,

1834
01:32:55,249 --> 01:32:57,615
then don't even bother
coming to my wedding!

1835
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:07,418
l'm proud of you, Lil.

1836
01:33:07,594 --> 01:33:08,652
Shut up, Helen!

1837
01:33:10,064 --> 01:33:12,931
Anybody else have anything
they want to share today?

1838
01:33:15,235 --> 01:33:18,466
l took two dogs already.
They're in the back of my van.

1839
01:33:36,957 --> 01:33:38,219
What?

1840
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:50,326
What? Where are you going?

1841
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:52,595
Hit and run! Classy!

1842
01:33:52,873 --> 01:33:54,272
Perfect! Okay.

1843
01:33:55,409 --> 01:33:58,936
l'm gonna find you!
l'm coming!

1844
01:33:59,146 --> 01:34:03,480
Come on! Come on! Come on.

1845
01:34:06,987 --> 01:34:08,955
No!

1846
01:34:24,271 --> 01:34:26,535
Shit.

1847
01:34:30,177 --> 01:34:32,338
l can't say
l'm surprised.

1848
01:34:32,546 --> 01:34:34,673
l did tell you to
get your lights fixed.

1849
01:34:34,882 --> 01:34:36,349
Yeah, l know.

1850
01:34:36,517 --> 01:34:38,576
And now here we are.

1851
01:34:40,187 --> 01:34:43,554
Look, l have
had a horrible day.

1852
01:34:43,757 --> 01:34:46,089
l don't need a lecture
from you right now, okay?

1853
01:34:46,293 --> 01:34:47,817
l just.. . Helen just.. .

1854
01:34:48,295 --> 01:34:49,262
Oh! Don't.. .

1855
01:34:49,696 --> 01:34:51,425
This didn't happen
because of Helen.

1856
01:34:51,799 --> 01:34:54,495
This happened
because you didn't get
your taillights fixed.

1857
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:56,134
lt's pretty simple.

1858
01:34:59,673 --> 01:35:01,937
Do you have any idea
how frustrating it is

1859
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:04,407
to see you,
night by night,
drive past me

1860
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:07,273
with your fucking
taillights still broken?

1861
01:35:07,481 --> 01:35:09,574
Do you have any idea
how crazy that makes me?

1862
01:35:09,783 --> 01:35:12,149
lt's a simple solution!

1863
01:35:12,286 --> 01:35:13,344
Your problem, Annie,

1864
01:35:13,454 --> 01:35:16,321
is that you just
don't understand
that you can hurt people

1865
01:35:16,657 --> 01:35:18,648
with these broken lights.

1866
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,019
Don't you see how
irresponsible this is?

1867
01:35:22,129 --> 01:35:25,826
Yes, l should have
gotten my fucking
taillights fixed.

1868
01:35:26,033 --> 01:35:27,933
But l didn't, okay?
l didn't.

1869
01:35:28,135 --> 01:35:30,262
Listen,
don't worry about it.

1870
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:32,962
Seriously.
Your message
was received.

1871
01:35:33,173 --> 01:35:35,971
No, look, please,
l don't know what's
going on with me right now.

1872
01:35:36,076 --> 01:35:39,842
Look, it's fine. Don't bother.
Really, what's done is done.

1873
01:35:40,047 --> 01:35:41,537
That's it?
Where are you going?

1874
01:35:41,682 --> 01:35:44,276
That's it! That's it.
That's how this works.

1875
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:45,440
Come on. l didn't.. .

1876
01:35:45,552 --> 01:35:49,283
For the record, Annie,
you flirted with me.

1877
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:53,626
You made me feel like
you really liked me,

1878
01:35:53,727 --> 01:35:55,058
which was really unfair.

1879
01:35:55,429 --> 01:35:58,865
And then you came home with me
and we did stuff, fun stuff,

1880
01:36:00,067 --> 01:36:02,331
and then you just left,
just like it was nothing.

1881
01:36:02,903 --> 01:36:06,430
Oh, please. l know
how guys do this thing.

1882
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:08,007
l know how guys act.

1883
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:10,733
One minute,
it means something.
The next minute, it doesn't.

1884
01:36:10,878 --> 01:36:11,867
Right, yeah, you've
got it all figured out.

1885
01:36:12,045 --> 01:36:13,069
Yeah.

1886
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:15,842
How is that
working out for you?
Pretty good?

1887
01:36:19,186 --> 01:36:20,346
Boom!

1888
01:36:20,454 --> 01:36:22,752
What's up, fuck-buddy?
You call for some
roadside assistance?

1889
01:36:27,628 --> 01:36:31,155
Thanks, officer.
l can handle it
from here on out.

1890
01:36:36,236 --> 01:36:37,260
Come on!

1891
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:40,231
l didn't have
anyone else to call!

1892
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:41,671
l didn't know that
you were gonna show up!

1893
01:36:41,775 --> 01:36:43,174
That's the problem
with cops, Annie.

1894
01:36:43,343 --> 01:36:44,742
We're just never
there when you need us.

1895
01:36:46,914 --> 01:36:47,903
That cop talks weird.

1896
01:36:54,888 --> 01:36:58,221
TED: Come on, dingus.
Tick-tock. l got shit to do.

1897
01:36:59,293 --> 01:37:01,625
Check it out.
Look what's steering the car.

1898
01:37:07,901 --> 01:37:09,493
Thanks again
for picking me up.

1899
01:37:09,603 --> 01:37:11,070
Not a problem.

1900
01:37:11,672 --> 01:37:13,003
Were you busy?

1901
01:37:13,273 --> 01:37:15,400
Well, it is Friday.

1902
01:37:17,644 --> 01:37:20,340
You know,
you look tired.

1903
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,539
lf you're tired,
you can totally

1904
01:37:22,716 --> 01:37:24,809
lay down in my lap,
if you want.

1905
01:37:25,385 --> 01:37:26,409
What?

1906
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,715
Just take a little lap-nap.

1907
01:37:34,995 --> 01:37:36,394
lf you want.

1908
01:37:37,230 --> 01:37:38,595
Open for biz.

1909
01:37:38,799 --> 01:37:40,289
Okay, can you just pull over?

1910
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,400
Yeah, actually,
that's an even better idea.

1911
01:37:42,502 --> 01:37:45,903
No, no, no, can you
please just stop the car?
l want to get out.

1912
01:37:46,006 --> 01:37:47,166
No, it's super gravelly.

1913
01:37:47,274 --> 01:37:49,208
Please pull over!
Why?

1914
01:37:49,309 --> 01:37:51,675
Because l would rather
get murdered out here

1915
01:37:51,778 --> 01:37:53,905
than spend the next
half-an-hour with you.

1916
01:37:54,014 --> 01:37:55,606
Can you please
just pull over?

1917
01:37:56,016 --> 01:37:58,075
Come on, Annie.
lt's called humor.

1918
01:37:58,285 --> 01:38:00,082
Learn about it.

1919
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:02,888
Besides, l would
never last a half-hour.

1920
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:08,553
Goodbye, Ted.

1921
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:15,897
lf you're trying to
turn me on, it's working.

1922
01:38:18,038 --> 01:38:19,630
You used me!

1923
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,105
No big deal.
You are no longer
my number three!

1924
01:38:36,123 --> 01:38:37,249
<i>Wilson!</i>

1925
01:38:40,694 --> 01:38:44,255
<i>Wilson! l'm sorry!</i>

1926
01:38:46,133 --> 01:38:47,998
<i>l'm sorry, Wilson.</i>

1927
01:38:49,002 --> 01:38:51,163
<i>Wilson, l'm sorry!</i>

1928
01:38:51,972 --> 01:38:52,939
<i>l'm sorry!</i>

1929
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:54,302
Oh, no, Wilson.

1930
01:38:54,508 --> 01:38:55,634
<i>Wilson!</i>

1931
01:38:57,878 --> 01:38:59,505
l'm coming in.

1932
01:38:59,713 --> 01:39:01,681
Let's go, let's go.
And we're walking.

1933
01:39:02,149 --> 01:39:03,980
Okay, we're walking.
Heel. Heel!

1934
01:39:04,418 --> 01:39:06,716
No pee. No!
Not on the carpet!

1935
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:09,047
Okay, we're coming.. .
We're coming in.

1936
01:39:09,156 --> 01:39:11,488
Everybody is in
and having fun.

1937
01:39:11,692 --> 01:39:13,922
We're having fun.
And heel! We're heeling.

1938
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:15,628
Heel!

1939
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,495
How many of
those did you take?

1940
01:39:17,664 --> 01:39:19,063
l took nine.

1941
01:39:19,266 --> 01:39:20,290
l took nine.

1942
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:25,233
Yeah, l did
slightly over-commit
to the whole dog thing.

1943
01:39:25,338 --> 01:39:28,205
lt turns out, l'm probably
more comfortable with six.

1944
01:39:28,408 --> 01:39:31,468
lt's a lot.. . That's
a lot of energy to deal with.

1945
01:39:31,678 --> 01:39:33,202
But you wouldn't know
anything about that,

1946
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:34,904
because you haven't
been returning my calls.

1947
01:39:36,616 --> 01:39:38,641
And say what, Megan?

1948
01:39:38,752 --> 01:39:41,687
Say, ''Hi, l can't
get off the couch.

1949
01:39:41,922 --> 01:39:45,358
''l got fired from my job.
l got kicked out
of my apartment.

1950
01:39:45,459 --> 01:39:48,690
''l can't pay any of my bills.
My car is a piece of shit.

1951
01:39:48,795 --> 01:39:51,320
''l don't have any friends.
The last time l.. .' '

1952
01:39:51,431 --> 01:39:53,763
You know what l
find interesting
about that, Annie?

1953
01:39:53,867 --> 01:39:56,802
lt's interesting to me
that you have
absolutely no friends.

1954
01:39:56,903 --> 01:39:58,336
You know why
it's interesting?

1955
01:39:58,538 --> 01:39:59,835
Here's a friend
standing directly

1956
01:40:00,006 --> 01:40:01,337
in front of you,
trying to talk to you.

1957
01:40:01,508 --> 01:40:02,873
And you choose to
talk about the fact

1958
01:40:03,043 --> 01:40:04,442
that you don't
have any friends.

1959
01:40:04,544 --> 01:40:05,875
You know what l mean.

1960
01:40:06,046 --> 01:40:07,411
No, l don't think
you want any help.

1961
01:40:07,514 --> 01:40:09,505
l think you want to
have a little pity party.
That's not true.

1962
01:40:09,616 --> 01:40:11,709
l think Annie wants
a little pity party.

1963
01:40:11,818 --> 01:40:13,843
You're an asshole, Annie!
Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

1964
01:40:13,954 --> 01:40:16,514
You're an asshole. l'm life.
ls life bothering you?

1965
01:40:16,623 --> 01:40:17,647
Yes! What are you doing?

1966
01:40:17,824 --> 01:40:18,848
l'm life, Annie.
l'm life, Annie.

1967
01:40:19,092 --> 01:40:21,492
You have got to
fight back on life.

1968
01:40:21,595 --> 01:40:22,789
Megan!

1969
01:40:22,963 --> 01:40:24,191
You better learn to fight.

1970
01:40:24,464 --> 01:40:25,453
Megan!

1971
01:40:25,565 --> 01:40:27,328
l'm life and l'm going
to bite you in the ass!

1972
01:40:29,503 --> 01:40:31,403
Megan.. .
lt's not me.
l'm your life. Turn over!

1973
01:40:31,505 --> 01:40:32,665
My God!

1974
01:40:32,773 --> 01:40:36,641
l'm trying to get you to fight
for your shitty life,
and you won't do it!

1975
01:40:36,743 --> 01:40:37,732
You just won't do it.
Stop it.

1976
01:40:38,011 --> 01:40:40,172
You stop slapping yourself.
Stop slapping yourself.

1977
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,814
l'm your life, Annie.
l'm your shitty.. .

1978
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,218
l'm sorry.

1979
01:40:46,353 --> 01:40:47,320
Nice hit.

1980
01:40:50,157 --> 01:40:51,146
All right.

1981
01:40:51,258 --> 01:40:53,453
l'm glad to see
you've got a little
bit of spark in you.

1982
01:40:54,327 --> 01:40:56,158
l knew that Annie
was in there somewhere.

1983
01:40:56,596 --> 01:40:58,029
l think.. .

1984
01:40:58,231 --> 01:41:01,530
l think you're ready now
to hear a little
story about a girl.

1985
01:41:01,735 --> 01:41:03,726
A girl named Megan.

1986
01:41:03,937 --> 01:41:05,404
A girl named
Megan that didn't have

1987
01:41:05,572 --> 01:41:07,062
a very good time
in high school.

1988
01:41:07,274 --> 01:41:10,300
l'm referring to
myself when l say ''Megan.' '

1989
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:12,410
lt's me, Megan.
Yeah, l got that.

1990
01:41:12,612 --> 01:41:14,079
l know you look at
me now and think,

1991
01:41:14,181 --> 01:41:16,149
''Boy, she must have
breezed through high school.' '

1992
01:41:16,249 --> 01:41:17,739
Not the case, Annie.

1993
01:41:17,851 --> 01:41:21,685
No, this was not easy
going up and down the halls.
Okay?

1994
01:41:21,788 --> 01:41:23,312
They used to
try to blow me up.

1995
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:25,014
They threw
firecrackers at my head.

1996
01:41:25,692 --> 01:41:26,659
Firecrackers.

1997
01:41:27,093 --> 01:41:29,493
l mean literally.
l'm not saying
that figuratively.

1998
01:41:29,596 --> 01:41:32,258
l got firecrackers
thrown at my head.
They called me a freak.

1999
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:34,061
Do you think l
let that break me?

2000
01:41:34,501 --> 01:41:36,765
Do you think l went home
to my mommy, crying,

2001
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:39,600
''l don't have any friends.
Megan doesn't
have any friends''?

2002
01:41:39,706 --> 01:41:42,072
No, l did not.
You know what l did?

2003
01:41:42,175 --> 01:41:44,666
l pulled myself up,
l studied really hard.

2004
01:41:44,778 --> 01:41:46,905
l read every book in
the library. And now?

2005
01:41:47,013 --> 01:41:48,378
l work for the government.
l have

2006
01:41:48,548 --> 01:41:49,947
the highest possible
security clearance.

2007
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:51,574
Don't repeat that!
l won't.

2008
01:41:51,685 --> 01:41:52,674
l can't protect you.

2009
01:41:53,019 --> 01:41:55,249
l know where
all the nukes are
and l know the codes.

2010
01:41:57,290 --> 01:41:58,279
l won't say anything.

2011
01:41:58,558 --> 01:42:00,651
You would be amazed.

2012
01:42:00,961 --> 01:42:02,223
A lot of shopping malls.

2013
01:42:02,495 --> 01:42:03,655
Don't repeat that!

2014
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:05,024
l won't.

2015
01:42:05,232 --> 01:42:06,290
l have six houses.

2016
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,726
l bought an 18-wheeler
a couple of months
ago just because l could.

2017
01:42:09,836 --> 01:42:11,030
Okay, you lost Lillian.

2018
01:42:11,137 --> 01:42:12,434
You got another best friend

2019
01:42:12,539 --> 01:42:14,166
sitting right in front of you,
if you would notice.

2020
01:42:15,141 --> 01:42:16,130
Huh?

2021
01:42:16,243 --> 01:42:17,938
Now, you got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

2022
01:42:18,645 --> 01:42:20,203
Okay, 'cause l do not
associate with people

2023
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:21,972
that blame the world
for their problems.

2024
01:42:22,082 --> 01:42:23,811
'Cause you're
your problem, Annie.

2025
01:42:24,017 --> 01:42:26,349
And you're also
your solution.

2026
01:42:27,921 --> 01:42:29,445
Right? l mean, that's.. .

2027
01:42:29,556 --> 01:42:31,649
You get that?

2028
01:42:32,859 --> 01:42:34,292
l just miss her, l guess.

2029
01:42:35,228 --> 01:42:37,321
Yeah, l know you do.

2030
01:42:37,831 --> 01:42:39,731
l know you do.

2031
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,134
All right, come on.
Bring it in.

2032
01:42:42,235 --> 01:42:43,634
There's the Annie.. .

2033
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:45,398
There's the Annie l
knew was there, okay?

2034
01:42:45,572 --> 01:42:47,767
All right.
Man, you have got
to wash your hair.

2035
01:42:47,941 --> 01:42:48,908
l'm sorry.

2036
01:42:49,042 --> 01:42:50,407
You've got to
wash that hair.

2037
01:43:16,102 --> 01:43:17,364
What's wrong?

2038
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:18,867
Nothing.

2039
01:43:23,877 --> 01:43:24,866
l love you.

2040
01:43:38,425 --> 01:43:40,859
Looks great. Thank you.

2041
01:43:41,127 --> 01:43:44,893
Rhodes and l worked out
a deal way back when,
so it's on the house.

2042
01:43:45,632 --> 01:43:46,690
Are you serious?

2043
01:43:46,933 --> 01:43:49,197
Yeah. l owe him big time.

2044
01:43:49,469 --> 01:43:51,198
That's really nice.

2045
01:43:58,645 --> 01:43:59,873
Hey, Mom?

2046
01:44:02,082 --> 01:44:03,344
This is my mom, Judy.

2047
01:44:03,450 --> 01:44:05,418
Hey, how are you?
Nice to meet you.

2048
01:44:05,518 --> 01:44:07,418
Good to meet you, too.

2049
01:44:08,455 --> 01:44:10,423
Wait a minute,
don't l know you from AA?

2050
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:14,089
BlLL COZBl: Oh, my gosh.
You made that artichoke dip,
didn't you?

2051
01:44:14,294 --> 01:44:15,761
lt's good, huh?

2052
01:44:15,862 --> 01:44:16,886
lt's just delicious.

2053
01:45:21,795 --> 01:45:22,784
Come in.

2054
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,425
Are you sure
you're not gonna
come with me today?

2055
01:45:29,736 --> 01:45:31,226
lt's Lillian's big day.

2056
01:45:31,337 --> 01:45:33,066
Mom, she doesn't
want me there.

2057
01:45:36,776 --> 01:45:38,710
l'll fix you
a tuna fish sandwich.

2058
01:45:39,045 --> 01:45:40,273
Mom, it's 8:00
in the morning.

2059
01:45:40,447 --> 01:45:41,846
You can put syrup on it.

2060
01:45:51,858 --> 01:45:53,223
l know.

2061
01:45:54,427 --> 01:45:55,394
Hi.

2062
01:45:55,762 --> 01:45:56,786
What do you want?

2063
01:45:56,996 --> 01:45:59,021
l was wondering
if you knew
where Lillian was.

2064
01:45:59,432 --> 01:46:01,332
No, why would l.. .
What do you mean?

2065
01:46:01,734 --> 01:46:04,328
l can't find her.
We've looked everywhere.

2066
01:46:04,537 --> 01:46:05,561
What?

2067
01:46:05,672 --> 01:46:07,833
She is missing.
Can you help?

2068
01:46:08,374 --> 01:46:10,001
Okay, just wait here.
l think l know

2069
01:46:10,176 --> 01:46:11,803
someone that
might be able to help.

2070
01:46:12,045 --> 01:46:14,172
l'll get my keys.
Can l just use.. .

2071
01:46:17,383 --> 01:46:21,251
l mean, l just don't know
what could have
possibly gone wrong.

2072
01:46:21,354 --> 01:46:22,946
Everything was going smoothly.

2073
01:46:23,056 --> 01:46:24,956
The dress looked fantastic.
lt had come in from Paris.

2074
01:46:25,391 --> 01:46:27,586
Dougie was being
great and very helpful.

2075
01:46:27,694 --> 01:46:32,324
l had organized everything
to the last final detail.

2076
01:46:32,432 --> 01:46:33,865
l just.. .

2077
01:46:34,067 --> 01:46:35,659
l don't know
what's happened to her.

2078
01:46:35,935 --> 01:46:38,028
l don't know.
You should know, right?

2079
01:46:38,138 --> 01:46:41,403
You're her best friend.
lt's weird that
you don't know.

2080
01:46:41,608 --> 01:46:42,802
You guys are so close.

2081
01:46:46,946 --> 01:46:50,404
Annie, l want to
apologize to you personally

2082
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:53,279
for all of the things
that have gone down.

2083
01:46:53,386 --> 01:46:55,320
l know that l hurt you,

2084
01:46:55,421 --> 01:46:57,889
and that l created a distance
between you and Lillian.

2085
01:46:57,991 --> 01:46:59,822
l want to
apologize for that.. .
l don't want to hear.. .

2086
01:46:59,926 --> 01:47:01,416
...and everything
that happened

2087
01:47:01,594 --> 01:47:03,084
at the shower.
And with Las Vegas.. .

2088
01:47:03,196 --> 01:47:04,959
Okay, l don't want
to hear any more,
honestly.

2089
01:47:05,064 --> 01:47:07,123
l don't even
want to talk to you.

2090
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,030
Harry never really
wants to talk to me, either.

2091
01:47:10,136 --> 01:47:12,832
He travels a lot.
Like, all year.

2092
01:47:12,939 --> 01:47:15,533
l'm basically just by myself.

2093
01:47:15,642 --> 01:47:18,634
l don't want to.. .
l don't feel sorry for you.

2094
01:47:19,846 --> 01:47:21,541
l really liked
that original dress

2095
01:47:21,714 --> 01:47:23,409
you picked at
the bridal store.

2096
01:47:23,516 --> 01:47:26,417
l thought it was beautiful.
You have really lovely taste.

2097
01:47:26,519 --> 01:47:29,955
Thanks, but it's
a little too late for that.

2098
01:47:30,156 --> 01:47:31,282
And l know.. .

2099
01:47:31,391 --> 01:47:34,360
l don't think
that Brazilian food
really gave us food poisoning.

2100
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:35,427
No, it did.

2101
01:47:35,595 --> 01:47:36,562
No, l don't think it did.

2102
01:47:36,663 --> 01:47:38,631
lt was the food.
l shit my pants
on the way home.

2103
01:47:38,731 --> 01:47:40,130
l don't think it
was your fault.

2104
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,429
That was my fault.

2105
01:47:43,336 --> 01:47:45,964
l think people just
ask me to their weddings

2106
01:47:46,139 --> 01:47:48,767
because l'm good at
organizing parties.

2107
01:47:50,877 --> 01:47:53,573
l don't have any
female friends.

2108
01:47:54,681 --> 01:47:56,148
l'm so sorry.

2109
01:47:56,549 --> 01:47:58,642
Why are you smiling, Annie?

2110
01:47:58,851 --> 01:48:00,478
lt's just.. .
lt's just.. .

2111
01:48:00,687 --> 01:48:03,087
lt's the first time l've
ever seen you look ugly.

2112
01:48:03,289 --> 01:48:05,018
And that makes
me kind of happy.

2113
01:48:05,792 --> 01:48:09,159
l look ugly? No, l don't.
l don't really look ugly.

2114
01:48:09,262 --> 01:48:11,560
A little bit.
You're an ugly crier,
but that's okay.

2115
01:48:11,664 --> 01:48:13,325
No, l'm not really
an ugly crier.

2116
01:48:13,566 --> 01:48:14,999
Maybe just
a little bit.
No.

2117
01:48:15,201 --> 01:48:16,498
Just a little bit.

2118
01:48:17,403 --> 01:48:19,337
lt's just my makeup.

2119
01:48:19,539 --> 01:48:21,530
But l still look pretty good.

2120
01:48:25,178 --> 01:48:26,338
ANNlE: Rhodes!

2121
01:48:27,647 --> 01:48:28,614
Rhodes.

2122
01:48:29,382 --> 01:48:30,644
Rhodes.

2123
01:48:31,818 --> 01:48:33,251
Come on! Rhodes!

2124
01:48:33,586 --> 01:48:35,076
He's ignoring you.
Let me.
Yes, he is.

2125
01:48:35,188 --> 01:48:37,122
Officer!
Roll down your window!

2126
01:48:37,323 --> 01:48:40,190
Excuse me! Please!

2127
01:48:41,261 --> 01:48:43,923
Rhodes,
l know you can hear me,
and l know you're mad at me,

2128
01:48:44,397 --> 01:48:46,729
but l need your help. Please!

2129
01:48:49,602 --> 01:48:51,229
You know this guy?

2130
01:49:00,446 --> 01:49:01,504
What are you doing?

2131
01:49:01,614 --> 01:49:03,206
l just want to
get his attention.

2132
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:06,575
Annie! Oh, my God.

2133
01:49:09,389 --> 01:49:11,118
ANNlE:
Reckless driving!

2134
01:49:13,459 --> 01:49:17,190
Annie, my hair!
What are you doing?

2135
01:49:17,330 --> 01:49:19,491
l'm speeding!
You better pull me over!

2136
01:49:22,735 --> 01:49:23,724
Really?

2137
01:49:23,936 --> 01:49:25,733
Here comes
the litter-bug!

2138
01:49:30,276 --> 01:49:32,176
Let's see what
Marmaduke's doing.

2139
01:49:32,512 --> 01:49:34,980
Just texting.
Talking on the phone
while l'm driving.

2140
01:49:35,081 --> 01:49:37,515
Not even using my hands.
Oh, hi!

2141
01:49:39,652 --> 01:49:40,619
Mmm! Yum! Yum!

2142
01:49:40,853 --> 01:49:42,320
Beer!

2143
01:49:42,488 --> 01:49:43,455
Yum! Yum! Yum!

2144
01:49:44,257 --> 01:49:45,246
ldiot.

2145
01:49:47,627 --> 01:49:49,458
ANNlE: Hey, what's up, man?

2146
01:49:59,706 --> 01:50:01,799
l don't care. l don't care.

2147
01:50:07,347 --> 01:50:09,941
l'm going to hurl.
l feel really sick, Annie!

2148
01:50:11,718 --> 01:50:13,948
Hey, who's driving that car?

2149
01:50:16,723 --> 01:50:17,747
Can we go up now?

2150
01:50:18,725 --> 01:50:20,556
That's not clever.

2151
01:50:20,927 --> 01:50:21,985
Hey!

2152
01:50:22,095 --> 01:50:23,562
l'm topless!

2153
01:50:24,897 --> 01:50:26,364
l'm totally topless.

2154
01:50:35,975 --> 01:50:37,135
Really?

2155
01:50:39,245 --> 01:50:41,110
Wow. Unbelievable.

2156
01:50:41,481 --> 01:50:43,142
What the fuck are you doing?

2157
01:50:43,349 --> 01:50:44,373
l don't know.

2158
01:50:44,484 --> 01:50:45,974
Hey! Are you crazy?

2159
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:47,411
Are you crazy?

2160
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:50,521
All of that stuff,
that would have been
dangerous for a good driver.

2161
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:53,759
l'm sorry. l just.. .
l really need your help.

2162
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,052
We can't find Lillian.

2163
01:50:56,496 --> 01:50:57,690
How long has she been gone?

2164
01:50:57,864 --> 01:50:59,058
She's been
missing for 12 hours.

2165
01:50:59,265 --> 01:51:00,493
12 hours?

2166
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:03,191
lt's not a missing person
until it's at least 24 hours.

2167
01:51:03,302 --> 01:51:05,497
Have you ever seen <i>CSl?</i>
24 hours.

2168
01:51:05,972 --> 01:51:08,167
Let me get on
with my job, Annie.

2169
01:51:08,374 --> 01:51:11,070
Nathan, please?

2170
01:51:11,277 --> 01:51:12,301
l really need your help.

2171
01:51:14,414 --> 01:51:15,676
Please, Nathan.

2172
01:51:16,349 --> 01:51:17,316
Who is this one?

2173
01:51:17,784 --> 01:51:18,808
This is Helen.
l'm Helen.

2174
01:51:19,018 --> 01:51:20,144
What?

2175
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:21,479
lt's Helen.

2176
01:51:21,854 --> 01:51:25,813
Hello, Helen.
l've heard wonderful things.

2177
01:51:29,028 --> 01:51:32,054
Okay, thanks, buddy.
Bye-bye.

2178
01:51:32,265 --> 01:51:33,823
Okay, we've traced
her cell phone

2179
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,558
to the corner of
Craner and Rose.

2180
01:51:36,436 --> 01:51:37,767
Do you know where that is?

2181
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:39,861
Yes. That is her apartment.

2182
01:51:40,706 --> 01:51:41,832
l thought you said
you looked there.

2183
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:43,030
We did. We did.
Last night.

2184
01:51:43,209 --> 01:51:44,198
Okay.

2185
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:47,240
So you're saying
she's at her apartment?
That's what you're telling me?

2186
01:51:47,346 --> 01:51:49,007
She must have gone
back after you left.

2187
01:51:49,115 --> 01:51:50,377
God, that was crazy of her.

2188
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:51,810
Thank God! Thank you.
Let's go. Let's go.

2189
01:51:51,984 --> 01:51:53,144
Okay.

2190
01:51:56,656 --> 01:51:58,021
We found her!

2191
01:52:01,828 --> 01:52:04,456
l am so sorry.
l didn't mean to
waste your time.

2192
01:52:04,564 --> 01:52:06,327
That's embarrassing.

2193
01:52:07,567 --> 01:52:09,432
Thank you.
No, you are welcome.

2194
01:52:09,535 --> 01:52:11,526
lt's this kind of
high-octane stuff

2195
01:52:11,704 --> 01:52:13,695
that really made me
want to become a cop.

2196
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:16,099
''Missing girl found
at her apartment.' '

2197
01:52:16,309 --> 01:52:17,708
lt's.. .

2198
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:19,844
lt's adrenalin-pinching.

2199
01:52:22,415 --> 01:52:23,814
lt's nice to see you.

2200
01:52:27,887 --> 01:52:30,651
l'm glad that you got
your taillights fixed.

2201
01:52:30,857 --> 01:52:32,757
Means l won't have
to stop you again.

2202
01:52:37,697 --> 01:52:38,686
Okay.

2203
01:52:40,466 --> 01:52:42,058
Annie, let's go.

2204
01:52:44,103 --> 01:52:46,162
Anyway,
go and save your friend
from her apartment.

2205
01:52:46,839 --> 01:52:48,067
Bye-bye.

2206
01:52:48,274 --> 01:52:49,571
Bye.

2207
01:53:17,603 --> 01:53:20,231
Do you mind actually
if l go by myself?

2208
01:53:21,908 --> 01:53:23,739
Sure.
Okay.

2209
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:26,569
Lil?

2210
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,213
Lillian?

2211
01:53:31,050 --> 01:53:32,039
Lil?

2212
01:53:32,151 --> 01:53:33,118
LlLLlAN: Go away.

2213
01:53:42,094 --> 01:53:43,118
What happened?

2214
01:53:46,165 --> 01:53:49,259
This whole
wedding is fucked up.

2215
01:53:49,669 --> 01:53:51,899
Helen just took
over everything, and

2216
01:53:54,307 --> 01:53:55,865
everything's got
out of control.

2217
01:53:55,975 --> 01:53:58,842
And my dad can't
afford the wedding.

2218
01:53:59,812 --> 01:54:03,248
This has been really
hard to do without you.

2219
01:54:04,383 --> 01:54:07,250
lt's been shitty.

2220
01:54:09,488 --> 01:54:11,080
l'm sorry.

2221
01:54:12,124 --> 01:54:13,955
Nope. l'm sorry.

2222
01:54:14,493 --> 01:54:16,256
l'm sorry l kicked
you out of my wedding.

2223
01:54:18,097 --> 01:54:19,155
lt's my fault.

2224
01:54:19,265 --> 01:54:20,254
No, it's my fault.

2225
01:54:20,399 --> 01:54:23,266
l think l'm the one
with the mental problems.

2226
01:54:23,536 --> 01:54:24,696
Yeah, wasn't it my
turn to be crazy?

2227
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:26,064
The bride's
supposed to be crazy.

2228
01:54:26,172 --> 01:54:27,161
Yes, technically.

2229
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,136
You kind of
stole all the crazy.
l out-crazied you.

2230
01:54:32,445 --> 01:54:33,844
Everything's
going to be okay.

2231
01:54:34,113 --> 01:54:36,274
Yeah? How do you know that?

2232
01:54:39,318 --> 01:54:41,843
l left the rehearsal
dinner last night.

2233
01:54:42,054 --> 01:54:44,113
l told Dougie l
had to go get Q-tips.

2234
01:54:44,323 --> 01:54:45,688
And

2235
01:54:46,792 --> 01:54:49,886
all of a sudden,
l realized l was
driving here.

2236
01:54:49,996 --> 01:54:51,054
l came here.

2237
01:54:53,799 --> 01:54:57,929
l realized this
is the last time
l'm going to be here

2238
01:54:58,137 --> 01:54:59,798
in this apartment

2239
01:55:00,006 --> 01:55:01,234
with that couch,

2240
01:55:01,641 --> 01:55:02,869
and this bed,

2241
01:55:03,075 --> 01:55:04,940
and take a bath in my bathtub.

2242
01:55:05,144 --> 01:55:06,941
Because you know
how much l love my bathtub.

2243
01:55:07,213 --> 01:55:08,202
lt's a good tub.

2244
01:55:08,314 --> 01:55:10,908
l slept in there on my
30th birthday, remember?
Uh-huh.

2245
01:55:12,018 --> 01:55:13,645
Everything's gonna change.

2246
01:55:15,254 --> 01:55:17,154
l mean, l'm not
going to get to

2247
01:55:17,323 --> 01:55:19,223
live five
minutes away from you.

2248
01:55:22,428 --> 01:55:23,986
And it makes me so sad.

2249
01:55:28,534 --> 01:55:29,501
Well, don't be.

2250
01:55:30,169 --> 01:55:33,104
Don't be sad.
Because things
are going to change,

2251
01:55:33,205 --> 01:55:36,641
but they'll be better.

2252
01:55:38,377 --> 01:55:39,537
You know?

2253
01:55:39,979 --> 01:55:43,506
You're gonna take
this huge, great,
beautiful step.

2254
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:46,814
And Dougie loves you
more than anything.

2255
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:49,146
And so do l.

2256
01:55:53,325 --> 01:55:55,953
But what about you?
What's gonna happen to you?

2257
01:56:01,767 --> 01:56:03,962
l'm gonna be fine.

2258
01:56:06,439 --> 01:56:09,135
So don't worry, okay?
l'm gonna be.. .

2259
01:56:09,341 --> 01:56:10,899
l'm gonna be fine.

2260
01:56:11,277 --> 01:56:12,801
l am fine.

2261
01:56:16,449 --> 01:56:19,850
And besides, you need
to blaze the trail for me.

2262
01:56:20,052 --> 01:56:22,953
And then report back
and tell me what's coming.

2263
01:56:23,856 --> 01:56:25,983
Whatever you say, boss.

2264
01:56:28,461 --> 01:56:30,361
All right, let's get
your dress on,

2265
01:56:30,529 --> 01:56:32,463
okay, and let's go
to your wedding.

2266
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:35,690
Oh, yeah.

2267
01:56:36,602 --> 01:56:37,967
That's the other problem.

2268
01:56:48,414 --> 01:56:52,475
Don't you dare laugh.

2269
01:57:00,426 --> 01:57:01,450
Okay.

2270
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,721
l cannot wear this dress!

2271
01:57:03,996 --> 01:57:05,486
Okay, don't panic.

2272
01:57:06,699 --> 01:57:08,166
This is a nightmare.

2273
01:57:09,034 --> 01:57:10,524
We'll fix it.

2274
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:12,360
We'll tweak it.

2275
01:57:13,072 --> 01:57:14,596
l will not let you
walk down that aisle

2276
01:57:14,707 --> 01:57:16,538
unless you look
perfect and beautiful,
l promise.

2277
01:57:16,876 --> 01:57:20,004
Do you have a chainsaw
and a blowtorch?

2278
01:57:22,815 --> 01:57:25,079
l think this wedding
is gonna be a disaster.

2279
01:57:25,184 --> 01:57:26,242
No, don't say that.

2280
01:57:26,652 --> 01:57:28,620
lf Helen had anything
to do with this wedding,

2281
01:57:28,721 --> 01:57:32,282
it is going to be perfect
and tasteful and beautiful.

2282
01:57:32,391 --> 01:57:33,358
That's true.

2283
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:37,156
MlNlSTER: Will you, Douglas,
take Lillian to be your wife?

2284
01:57:37,429 --> 01:57:40,364
Will you love her,
comfort her, and keep her

2285
01:57:40,533 --> 01:57:43,468
and, forsaking all others,
remain true to her

2286
01:57:43,569 --> 01:57:45,537
as long as you
both shall live?

2287
01:57:45,638 --> 01:57:46,627
l do.

2288
01:57:47,006 --> 01:57:49,531
MlNlSTER: And will you,
Lillian, take Douglas
to be your husband?

2289
01:57:49,642 --> 01:57:51,940
Will you love him,
comfort him, and keep him

2290
01:57:52,144 --> 01:57:53,406
as long as you
both shall live?

2291
01:57:54,747 --> 01:57:56,009
l do.

2292
01:57:57,883 --> 01:58:00,010
MlNlSTER: By the powers
vested in me
by the state of lllinois,

2293
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:02,048
l pronounce you
husband and wife.

2294
01:58:02,321 --> 01:58:03,379
You may now kiss the bride.

2295
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:15,790
Ladies and gentlemen,

2296
01:58:15,901 --> 01:58:20,304
here with us tonight is
Lillian's favorite band
singing her favorite song.

2297
01:58:20,506 --> 01:58:24,704
Put your hands
together for
Wilson Phillips!

2298
01:58:29,014 --> 01:58:29,981
Hi, everybody!

2299
01:58:32,518 --> 01:58:33,746
How we doing tonight?

2300
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,220
l am not paying
for this shit.

2301
01:58:38,357 --> 01:58:39,551
Really?

2302
01:58:41,293 --> 01:58:42,624
lt's the last one,
l promise.

2303
01:58:42,728 --> 01:58:44,423
The last one.
The last one.

2304
01:58:45,097 --> 01:58:47,998
<i>l know this pain</i>

2305
01:58:49,368 --> 01:58:53,429
<i>Why do you lock yourself</i>
<i>up in these chains?</i>

2306
01:58:55,274 --> 01:58:58,539
<i>No one can change</i>
<i>your life except for you</i>

2307

l put a loaded gun
in Dougie's carry-on.

2337
02:00:43,749 --> 02:00:47,583
The TSA is going to

02:01:08,774 --> 02:01:09,832
lt was great, right?
Yeah.

2346
02:01:10,075 --> 02:01:11,235
lt was perfect.

2347
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:13,138
lt was great.

2348
02:01:13,312 --> 02:01:14,540
Yeah, it was great.

2349
02:01:18,083 --> 02:01:20,017
lt was really
nice meeting you.

2350

Yeah, it was.. .

2351
02:01:22,821 --> 02:01:25,449
Helen, it was really
nice meeting you, too.

2352
02:01:29,561 --> 02:01:31,188
Hey, you know, maybe

2353
02:01:31,296 --> 02:01:34,891
sometime the three of us
could go to
Rockin' Sushi together.

2354
02:01:36,735 --> 02:01:39,568
Thank you, Annie.

2355
02:01:39,772 --> 02:01:41,433
l would love that.

2356
02:01:47,846 --> 02:01:49,746
Your ride is here.

2357
02:02:06,198 --> 02:02:08,132
Hey, how did everything go?

2358
02:02:10,369 --> 02:02:11,393
Strangely well.

2359
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:12,594
Good.

2360
02:02:15,641 --> 02:02:17,233
So, l ate your cake

2361
02:02:18,277 --> 02:02:19,676
that you left.

2362
02:02:19,812 --> 02:02:20,779
You did?
Yeah.

2363
02:02:21,046 --> 02:02:22,206
l mean, l had to
fight some raccoons off.

2364
02:02:23,282 --> 02:02:25,443
But that's okay.
l'm pretty strong and tough,

2365
02:02:25,617 --> 02:02:27,778
so it wasn't
much of a contest.

2366
02:02:27,986 --> 02:02:29,044
So that might have been.. .

2367
02:02:29,154 --> 02:02:30,451
l'm just going to
kiss you now
rather than just.. .

2368
02:02:43,502 --> 02:02:44,867
<i>Officer Rhodes,</i>
<i>please report to...</i>

2369
02:02:44,970 --> 02:02:45,937
Oh! l'm on duty.

2370
02:02:46,805 --> 02:02:48,432
And l need to
put my uniform on.

2371
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:50,405
lf l drive like this,
they're gonna think
l just stole a car,

2372
02:02:50,509 --> 02:02:51,669
which wouldn't be great.

2373
02:02:52,978 --> 02:02:55,310
You could ride
with me if you want.

2374
02:02:55,547 --> 02:02:57,447
You want to come?
Yeah, l do.

2375
02:02:57,716 --> 02:02:58,705
Come on.

2376
02:02:58,817 --> 02:02:59,784
All right.

2377
02:02:59,985 --> 02:03:00,974
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

2378
02:03:01,153 --> 02:03:02,177
l'm getting in the car.

2379
02:03:02,287 --> 02:03:03,914
No, no, no, you got
to get in the back.
What?

2380
02:03:04,123 --> 02:03:06,250
You can't sit in the front,
it's against regulations.

2381
02:03:06,358 --> 02:03:08,417
Come on. Come on.

2382
02:03:08,627 --> 02:03:10,288
You're going to make
me sit in the back seat?

2383
02:03:10,529 --> 02:03:11,791
Yeah, come on.

2384
02:03:11,897 --> 02:03:12,921
Sorry. Habit.

2385
02:03:13,298 --> 02:03:14,492
All right.

2386
02:03:14,666 --> 02:03:15,860
lt's a force of habit.

2387
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:21,036
Can l please get
in the front seat?

2388
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:24,209
Actually, no, l'm afraid
there's a warrant
out for your arrest.

2389
02:03:24,409 --> 02:03:26,036
What? Why?

2390
02:03:26,145 --> 02:03:28,773
Reckless driving,
littering, texting,

2391
02:03:28,981 --> 02:03:30,846
consuming alcohol
while operating a vehicle.

2392
02:03:31,049 --> 02:03:32,073
You didn't
think l was going to

2393
02:03:32,184 --> 02:03:33,742
let you get away
with that, did you?

2394
02:03:34,553 --> 02:03:36,783
Could we put the siren on?
Please?

2395
