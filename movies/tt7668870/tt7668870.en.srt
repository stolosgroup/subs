00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,727
Oh.
No, look over there.

4
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,795
- Look over there. Okay.
- All right. Look over there.

5
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:41,401
Let's take a picture.
One...

6
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,869
- You say "cheese," okay? One, two...
- Say "cheese."

7
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,937
- Cheese!
- ...three.

8
00:02:30,182 --> 00:02:32,650
The four and the one.
No, that's your two.

9
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,752
There you go. Four, one.

10
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,488
Four, one. Four, one.
And then five, one.

11
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,956
When you're ready,
you can switch to five.

12
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:50,168
- Look what I got!
- What is that?

13
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,538
What, you don't know Pokémon?

14
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,556
Come on.

15
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,958
- Faster, faster.
- Smile! Oh, sorry. This is video.

16
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,195
- Just slide the thing.
- Slide the...

17
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,952
Video log 3.7.

18
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:41,553
I have reason to believe
my wife is a robot.

19
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,958
Can seemingly run for miles.
Wait up.

20
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,824
Stop. Don't!

21
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,229
Everybody's grounded!

22
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,031
Whee!

23
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,970
Yes! Bravo!

24

<i>Video log 6.7.</i>

25
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,186
I think we can,
I think we can, I think we...

26
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:49,621
Pam?

27
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:51,824
Pam.

28
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:05,388
Hey, Dad.

29
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,326
Hey, sweetheart.
How's it going?

30
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:08,791
Um...

31
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:09,627
Good.

32
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,493
What's up with the FaceTime?

33
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:12,928
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

34
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,299
What is wrong
with this picture?

35
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:16,732
I'm about to be in trouble,
aren't I?

36
00:07:16,734 --> 00:07:18,135
Yes.

37
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:21,570
Yup.

38
00:07:21,572 --> 00:07:23,239
Maybe we should
keep the trash in your room?

39
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,807
Huh?

40
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,811
Maybe the smell will remind you.

41
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:29,814
I'm sorry, Dad.
It won't happen again.

42
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:33,217
Okay. Where are you,
by the way?

43
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:36,319
- Study group.
- Ah. Whose house are you at?

44
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,687
Uh, one of my friends in bio.
You haven't met her yet.

45
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,156
Oh, Miss Popular.
When are you gonna be home?

46
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,092
Uh, I think we're gonna go late.

47
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,693
Late like 9:00-ish or...

48
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,962
- Late, like...
- all night, probably.

49
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,797
I thought we were gonna
eat dinner together.

50
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,834
We ate together on Monday.

51
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:53,104
Didn't know
you were counting.

52
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:56,171
Okay.

53
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,107
- I should get back.
- Right. Oh, one more thing.

54
00:07:58,109 --> 00:07:59,478
- I want to know about the final you...
- Bye, Dad!

55
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:01,579
...took today.

56
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:23,860
Uh, yo, what am I looking at?

57
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,862
Exactly.

58
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,231
I cannot remember the name
of this thing.

59
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:33,504
Uh, it was like a kimchee,
okra, mussel stew.

60
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:34,871
Pam used to make it.

61
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:39,640
- Oh. The kimchee gumbo.
- Gumbo, gumbo.

62
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:42,077
- Yeah.
- That's it. Do you have the recipe?

63
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,282
- 'Cause I'm definitely forgetting something.
- Yeah, I might.

64
00:09:45,682 --> 00:09:47,418
But I can definitely tell
you there's no pot in it.

65
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:56,160
Oh. This healthy and organic jar
of oregano?

66
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,329
How much are you smoking?

67
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,630
You doing every day or...

68
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:02,199
- Do you do it at work?
- Dude.

69
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:04,602
Can we not do this right now?
Please?

70
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,102
It's been a long day.

71
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,142
Uh... edamame.

72
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,312
I'm pretty sure
there's edamame in it.

73
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,516
Let me find the actual thing.

74
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:20,950
What's, uh...

75
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:22,752
What's Margot up to tonight?

76
00:10:24,087 --> 00:10:25,989
She's at a study group
all night.

77
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,725
- Wait, all night tonight?
- Yeah, just got off the phone with her.

78
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:33,663
She's got a bio final
next week. Why?

79
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:36,500
Oh, nothing.
She's good, though?

80
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,799
Yeah. Why do you ask?

81
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,801
Making sure you guys
are both talking to each other,

82
00:10:40,803 --> 00:10:43,006
both happy,
et cetera, et cetera.

83
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,010
Everything's fine, Peter.
Thanks for asking.

84
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:52,282
Hey. Look, Davy.

85
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,653
- Do you think that maybe you should just...
- Dude, everything's fine.

86
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,197
Hey, I got to go.
But send me that recipe. Please?

87
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:08,597
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

88
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,499
Love you.

89
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,165
- Bye.
- Bye.

90
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,495
- Make sure to get all the water out.
- Are these ready?

91
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,431
Yeah, they're ready. Go on.

92
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,572
Stop. You got to drain
all the water.

93
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,976
Turn it off.

94
00:11:58,214 --> 00:11:59,447
Let's stir it in.

95
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:00,917
We got to mix those up first.

96
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:02,385
Okay.

97
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,685
- You gonna try mixing it?
- Yeah.

98
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:05,655
Okay. Here.

99
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,957
Okay.

100
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,960
Good. Gentle. Do it slowly.

101
00:12:13,196 --> 00:12:14,861
Do you see
how those are all done?

102
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:16,399
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

103
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:29,996
<i>Hey, you've reached
Margot's phone.</i>

104
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:31,500
<i>Leave me a message
or text me back.</i>

105
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:34,903
Hi, sweetheart. Sorry I missed your call.
I was asleep.

106
00:14:35,504 --> 00:14:38,873
Um, just checking in 'cause it looks like
you already left for school this morning.

107
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,176
Um... Also, what time did
you get in last night?

108
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,910
All right, give me a text
when you get this.

109
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:45,914
No need to call.
We both know you usually...

110
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,618
forget.

111
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,753
...map their topography

112
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:28,788
across all the tiers
in the application system,

113
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,023
and then in real time
and on continuous basis,

114
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:32,127
measure them end to end...

115
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:34,763
David, you with us?

116
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:36,997
Yeah. Sorry. I'm here.

117
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:39,933
Do you have the integration
report on the Bellington system?

118
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,001
Um...

119
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,236
Engineering is still
running tests,

120
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,137
but I should be able
to integrate by Monday.

121
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:46,842
Put some pressure on them,
all right?

122
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:48,944
Yep. Pressure.

123
00:15:49,678 --> 00:15:51,611
Okay, team. Anything we forgot?

124
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,178
- I think that's it.
- I don't think we did.

125
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,514
All right. Have a good weekend.

126
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:55,748
- See you.
- Cool. Take care.

127
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,785
- Bye.
- All right. See ya.

128
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:29,014
<i>Hey, you've reached
Margot's phone.</i>

129
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,415
<i>Leave me a message
or text me back.</i>

130
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,786
Hey, Margot. Dad again.

131
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:35,655
Not sure if you've been
checking your messages,

132
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:38,325
but, um, I'm starting
to get a little...

133
00:16:39,293 --> 00:16:41,128
Why did you leave
your laptop at home?

134
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:47,165
Okay, uh, it is 3:30,
one hour after school ended

135
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,803
on Friday, May 12.

136
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,441
Duh. Okay. It's Friday.

137
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,211
I know where you are. All right.

138
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,915
Ignore this message.
I love you. Bye.

139
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:35,982
<i>Hello?</i>

140
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:38,150
- Hi. Mrs. Shahinian?
- <i>Yes?</i>

141
00:17:38,152 --> 00:17:40,686
This is David Kim,
Margot's father.

142
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:43,522
<i>Yes. I'm in the middle of a lesson.
May I call you back afterwards?</i>

143
00:17:43,524 --> 00:17:45,524
Right.
No, this'll just take a second.

144
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:48,529
Can you put my daughter
on the phone just for a second?

145
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,830
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Kim. I'm confused
what you're calling about.</i>

146
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:55,235
My daughter, Margot Kim, is in
a lesson with you right now.

147
00:17:57,972 --> 00:18:01,076
<i>Margot Kim canceled her classes
six months ago.</i>

148
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:04,511
What?

149
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:07,681
<i>Is she looking
to restart lessons?</i>

150
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:14,254
Hold on. That... doesn't make any sense.
She loves piano.

151
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:21,362
<i>Mr. Kim, is everything okay?</i>

152
00:18:22,296 --> 00:18:25,030
Yes. Um...
Everything's fine.

153
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:26,598
Thank you.
Thank you, Mrs. Shahinian.

154
00:21:10,496 --> 00:21:13,766
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

155
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:18,002
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, hi. I'm David Kim.

156
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:19,603
- I'm Margot Kim's...
- <i>Pam's husband.</i>

157
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:21,071
- Yeah.
- <i>Of course I remember.</i>

158
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,741
- <i>How are you doing?</i>
- I'm good. I'm good.

159
00:21:23,743 --> 00:21:25,545
Listen, the reason I'm calling
is that, um...

160
00:21:26,312 --> 00:21:28,280
I haven't been able to reach
Margot for a little bit.

161
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,481
And I'm sure
her phone is dead,

162
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,783
but I was just wondering if I could
speak to Isaac and see if...

163
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:34,487
<i>Well, it's got to be more of
a reception problem, right?</i>

164
00:21:35,388 --> 00:21:37,321
Uh... What do you mean?

165
00:21:37,323 --> 00:21:38,825
<i>You know, if they're
all in the mountains.</i>

166
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:41,260
Sorry, what mountains?

167
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:44,697
<i>Camping. Isaac is camping
with his friends.</i>

168
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:46,799
<i>Margot was definitely invited.</i>

169
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,668
She was.

170
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,268
<i>I'm pretty positive
she's there, too.</i>

171
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,472
<i>Did she not tell you?</i>

172
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,341
Sh... She did.

173
00:21:56,909 --> 00:21:59,844
I'm, um... Yeah, I'm looking
through her texts now.

174
00:21:59,846 --> 00:22:02,179
She didn't mention mountains,
that's why. Yeah.

175
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:04,849
<i>Yeah. They've been planning this for a
while. I can't imagine she just couldn't...</i>

176
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:07,383
Do you happen to know when they left?
The reason I'm asking

177
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:10,054
is that school has her
marked as absent today.

178
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:11,822
<i>Did they all ditch school?</i>

179
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,791
<i>I'll tell you something,
if that's what they did,</i>

180
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:15,226
<i>Isaac is in big trouble.</i>

181
00:22:15,228 --> 00:22:17,161
That's...

182
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,098
That's definitely what happened.

183
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,198
- Kids.
- <i>Tell you what.</i>

184
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
<i>They're planning on heading back
tomorrow morning anyway.</i>

185
00:22:23,202 --> 00:22:24,902
<i>Once they get reception,</i>

186
00:22:24,904 --> 00:22:26,670
<i>I will let Isaac know
to have Margot give you a call.</i>

187
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:28,739
Perfect. That is perfect.
Thank you.

188
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:30,406
- <i>Is everything okay with you two?</i>
- Thank you so...

189
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:32,209
- What do you mean?
- <i>Well, I...</i>

190
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:34,745
<i>I just haven't spoken to you
since Pam's...</i>

191
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:36,881
Oh. Oh. Thank you.

192
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:39,819
Everything is great.
Margot and I are great.

193
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,567
- Hello?
<i>- Hey. Mr. Kim? This is Isaac. My mom told me to...</i>

194
00:23:31,569 --> 00:23:35,605
- Isaac! Yes, hi. Sorry to have you call me so early.
- <i>It's okay.</i>

195
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:37,442
<i>Just wanted to say I'm sorry
I couldn't be of more help.</i>

196
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:40,612
Yeah. Can you put my daughter
on the phone, please?

197
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,448
<i>Did my mom not tell you?</i>

198
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:45,418
What... What do you mean?

199
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:48,987
<i>She never came.</i>

200
00:23:50,289 --> 00:23:51,456
What? What are you...

201
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,023
- Isaac, what do you mean?
- <i>I mean she never came.</i>

202
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:56,459
<i>I even reached out to her
after school on Friday</i>

203
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:58,630
<i>when we were all heading out and
my car still had an extra seat.</i>

204
00:23:59,198 --> 00:24:00,065
What did she say?

205
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,903
<i>She... didn't respond.</i>

206
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:12,644
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

207
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:14,978
<i>Hi. I'm calling
about a possible...</i>

208
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,515
<i>I'm calling to report
a missing person.</i>

209
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,417
- <i>Okay, who is this regarding?</i>
<i>- Uh, my daughter.</i>

210
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,353
<i>I know I should've called sooner.
I just thought that...</i>

211
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:24,187
- <i>That's okay, sir.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

212
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,689
<i>The first thing
we need to do is file a report.</i>

213
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:29,694
<i>After that, I'll put out a call to a detective
in the area who will be in touch with you.</i>

214
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:32,862
- <i>All right.</i>
<i>- Now, let's start with her name.</i>

215
00:24:32,864 --> 00:24:37,168
<i>Margot Kim. M-A-R-G-O-T.</i>

216
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:38,837
<i>Kim. K-I-M.</i>

217
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,978
- Hello?
<i>- Hi. Is this David Kim?</i>

218
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,482
Yes, this is David Kim.
I'm assuming this is...

219
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:54,183
<i>Good morning, Mr. Kim.
My name is Rosemary Vick.</i>

220
00:24:54,185 --> 00:24:56,919
<i>I'm the detective sergeant
assigned to your daughter's case.</i>

221
00:24:56,921 --> 00:24:58,955
Yeah. Good morning.
I've been waiting for your call.

222
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,925
<i>Of course.
We're working as fast as we can.</i>

223
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:04,193
<i>I'm currently 35 minutes away
from your house.</i>

224
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:07,699
<i>But while I have you, do you feel
comfortable telling me what you know?</i>

225
00:25:08,099 --> 00:25:09,832
I just told every detail I know

226
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:12,035
to whoever I got off
the phone with an hour ago.

227
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:14,137
- I don't know what you guys are doing.
- <i>I promise you, Mr. Kim,</i>

228
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,706
<i>we are taking this
very seriously.</i>

229
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:20,111
<i>And as a parent myself, I can only
imagine what you must be feeling.</i>

230
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,948
<i>But for me to help you, I do need
to know how everything unfolded,</i>

231
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:25,350
<i>from your eyes.</i>

232
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:27,385
Understood...

233
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,553
Detective.

234
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,261
<i>Okay, let's see
if I got this right.</i>

235
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:40,229
<i>One: after
a group study session,</i>

236
00:25:40,231 --> 00:25:43,501
<i>Margot, with her car, didn't
return home Thursday evening.</i>

237
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,074
<i>Two: she called three times
at 11:00 p.m.</i>

238
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,245
<i>Three: she didn't attend school
on Friday.</i>

239
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:59,716
<i>And four: she's been skipping piano
classes for the last six months.</i>

240
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,418
- <i>Was all of that correct?</i>
- Yes.

241
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,191
<i>Okay. Mr. Kim, I am going to find
out what happened to your daughter.</i>

242
00:26:06,657 --> 00:26:09,058
<i>But I'll need to know
a lot more about her, okay?</i>

243
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,360
Yes, yes.
What do you want me to do?

244
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,795
I'll go talk
to neighbors. I'll...

245
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:17,033
<i>We'll handle the ground investigation,
Mr. Kim. That's our job.</i>

246
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,967
<i>But if there's something
a parent can do,</i>

247
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:21,839
<i>it's shedding light for us
on who your daughter is</i>

248
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:23,841
<i>and the people she talks to.</i>

249
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,614
<i>Is that something
you can help us with?</i>

250
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,251
Yes.

251
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:37,322
I can help with that.

252
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:50,487
<i>Okay. It's already been 36
hours since Margot's last call,</i>

253
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,422
<i>so we've got to move
a little quickly.</i>

254
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:58,928
<i>We'll be taking a copy of
Margot's hard drive to Forensics.</i>

255
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:00,930
<i>But in the meantime...</i>

256
00:29:02,165 --> 00:29:04,301
<i>any information
you can give me about her</i>

257
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,271
<i>or the people
around her will help.</i>

258
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:11,573
<i>Wait, you can't find Margot?</i>

259
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:14,743
No, I can't. Do you mind
answering some questions for me to help?

260
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:17,845
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, when was the last time you saw her?

261
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:20,450
Um... Tuesday.
Her locker's near me.

262
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,651
All right, on Thursday evening,

263
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:24,586
she attended a study group
for her biology class.

264
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:27,289
- Do you know anything about that?
- She's probably in AP Bio, right?

265
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:30,160
- Yes. She is.
- Yeah, no, I'm in regular.

266
00:29:31,093 --> 00:29:32,494
What were you doing
Thursday night?

267
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:36,231
Thursday night,
I was at my dad's house.

268
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,300
Yeah, he picked me up
after finals that day.

269
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:39,969
All right.
Thank you, Jonah.

270
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:43,707
How does, uh...
how does this look?

271
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,614
Perfect. Hey, update me whenever
you learn something. Big or small.

272
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:54,482
Okay.
Where are you going?

273
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:56,353
To find out what the rest
of her Thursday looked like.

274
00:29:57,321 --> 00:29:58,187
Oh. Oh.

275
00:29:58,722 --> 00:29:59,855
And share that with me, too.

276
00:30:09,332 --> 00:30:10,600
<i>And what about Thursday night?</i>

277
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,734
<i>Thursday night,</i>

278
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,736
<i>I was finishing up
my final paper for English.</i>

279
00:30:14,738 --> 00:30:17,541
<i>I don't know.
Xbox, dinner, some Netflix?</i>

280
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,607
<i>I just finished my last final,</i>

281
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,911
<i>which means I was
at Carmen's house playing pong.</i>

282
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:24,046
<i>Ping... Ping-pong.</i>

283
00:30:29,385 --> 00:30:31,686
<i>What about study group?
Do you know who hosted that?</i>

284
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:34,021
- <i>I took bio last year, so no.</i>
<i>- No idea.</i>

285
00:30:34,023 --> 00:30:35,523
She and I
are on different AP paths,

286
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,857
so it was
kind of hard to keep tabs.

287
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,160
But you guys are friends.

288
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,628
Kind of.

289
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,062
What are you talking about?

290
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:43,265
You invited her
on a camping trip.

291
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,200
Well, yeah.
I mean, you know my mom.

292
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:47,169
Yes. So?

293
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:50,239
She was really good friends
with Margot's mom.

294
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:51,842
Okay, so?

295
00:30:53,342 --> 00:30:54,310
She felt bad...

296
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:57,246
about everything
that happened to you guys.

297
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:00,817
But she has friends, right?

298
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,685
- <i>Define "friends."</i>
<i>- Do people invite her to things?</i>

299
00:31:04,687 --> 00:31:06,887
<i>I think people
occasionally invite her to things.</i>

300
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:09,323
- <i>She just never comes.</i>
<i>- She keeps to herself a lot.</i>

301
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,892
- <i>She's quiet.</i>
<i>- I did see her eat lunch alone.</i>

302
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:12,763
<i>On Thursday?</i>

303
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,231
<i>Every day.</i>

304
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:21,001
David, look,

305
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:22,804
I know you don't want
to hear this from me right now,

306
00:31:22,806 --> 00:31:24,505
but you got to take it easy.

307
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,573
I can help with everything
that you're looking through.

308
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:29,076
Are there any Facebook friends
you haven't talked to yet?

309
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:31,147
Yes. Ninety-four.

310
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:34,281
And, apparently, since nobody
was actually her friend,

311
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,719
I don't know who to talk to without
calling every name I read online.

312
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:40,489
What about offline?

313
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,214
- <i>Yeah, that was at my place.</i>
<i>- That was your place?</i>

314
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,784
<i>- You hosted the study group on Thursday night for bio?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

315
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:13,187
<i>So you were with Margot for
the majority of the night. Did you...</i>

316
00:32:13,189 --> 00:32:14,890
<i>Well, the study group
only went till 9:00.</i>

317
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,259
<i>No, no.
She said it was going all night.</i>

318
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:19,595
No, she definitely left at 9:00.

319
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:20,830
Maybe even earlier.

320
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:24,733
Did she say
where she was going?

321
00:32:25,534 --> 00:32:27,568
- Not really.
- How'd she look?

322
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,470
Was she worried? Did she look scared?
Was she talking?

323
00:32:29,472 --> 00:32:32,171
Honestly, I don't know.
We're not really that close.

324
00:32:32,173 --> 00:32:33,809
Well, then why did you
invite her to study group?

325
00:32:36,645 --> 00:32:38,112
I'm trying to get into Berkeley
next year.

326
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:41,317
Okay, you were...

327
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:43,517
You were in her class, though.

328
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,353
Did she mention anything unusual
going on lately?

329
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,691
- Was she acting strange?
- Uh...

330
00:32:49,859 --> 00:32:51,660
You know,
she did go on Tumblr a lot.

331
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:53,896
What? What is a "tumbler"?

332
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:33,368
First, she fills up her gas.

333
00:33:37,806 --> 00:33:39,507
Then exits off the 101.

334
00:33:42,443 --> 00:33:45,046
And then turns onto
the 152 East.

335
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:46,715
10:02 p.m.

336
00:33:49,384 --> 00:33:51,185
152 East?

337
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:03,933
That exit leads out of town.

338
00:34:04,632 --> 00:34:06,699
She took it alone.

339
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:09,201
That doesn't make sense. This
does not sound like my daughter.

340
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:10,837
She's acting like
a totally different person.

341
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:12,740
Okay, hold on, hold on.
You just gave me an idea.

342
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:16,877
In the meantime,
start expanding

343
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,914
from only the people
she communicated with.

344
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:21,416
Look into her behavior also.

345
00:34:57,885 --> 00:34:59,821
- Oh, my God.
- What?

346
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:04,423
She's been depositing her piano
cash into her checking account every week.

347
00:35:04,425 --> 00:35:05,994
The hell was she doing
with all that money?

348
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,334
Six days ago, she made an
outgoing transaction of $2,500

349
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:15,103
to "Venmo."

350
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,472
The payment service?

351
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,175
There it is. $2,500.

352
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,778
Six days ago.

353
00:35:24,312 --> 00:35:25,711
Does it say what it was for?

354
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:27,313
Nothing but a peace sign.

355
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:28,349
Who did she send it to?

356
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:35,488
Doesn't say.

357
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,358
Okay. That's weird.

358
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:39,060
That's really weird.

359
00:35:41,194 --> 00:35:44,499
You don't think she's involved
with anything serious, right?

360
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:47,867
Davy.

361
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:49,202
I don't know. I got to go.

362
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:03,976
<i>Sir, I don't
have to tell you anything.</i>

363
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:06,979
I just want to know where you were
the night my daughter went missing.

364
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:09,848
<i>Like I said,
I had a prior engagement.</i>

365
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,183
- What are you hiding?
- <i>I was busy.</i>

366
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:12,584
- What are you hiding?
- <i>Nothing!</i>

367
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:14,220
Then answer the damn question

368
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:16,021
before there's a cop
knocking on your door.

369
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:18,025
Where were you the night
my daughter went missing?

370
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:49,454
Hello?

371
00:37:49,456 --> 00:37:50,924
<i>Does the name
Rachel Jeun ring a bell?</i>

372
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:56,463
No. Why?

373
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:03,635
- It's Margot.
- <i>You mentioned earlier</i>

374
00:38:03,637 --> 00:38:05,570
<i>she was acting like
a different person,</i>

375
00:38:05,572 --> 00:38:08,473
<i>so I had our Forensics team look
through any deleted contacts</i>

376
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:09,976
<i>on the copy of her hard drive.</i>

377
00:38:10,977 --> 00:38:13,745
<i>One of those contacts was
a local forger.</i>

378
00:38:13,747 --> 00:38:16,316
<i>He said Margot picked up an ID
a few days ago,</i>

379
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:19,252
<i>around the same time
she withdrew all that money.</i>

380
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:21,321
"Withdrew"?

381
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:24,823
What? Withdrew what money?

382
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:27,360
<i>David, I also spoke
to security at Venmo</i>

383
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:31,462
<i>to find out more about the account
Margot sent the $2,500 to.</i>

384
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:32,799
Yeah. Do they know
who it belonged to?

385
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:34,768
<i>It belonged to Margot.</i>

386
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:38,538
She...

387
00:38:40,106 --> 00:38:41,675
She sent the money
to herself?

388
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:44,374
What was she doing,
running a laundering scheme?

389
00:38:44,376 --> 00:38:45,645
<i>That's what it looks like.</i>

390
00:38:47,147 --> 00:38:49,113
<i>I'd see this a lot
in narcotics.</i>

391
00:38:49,115 --> 00:38:50,949
<i>People who know their money
is being watched</i>

392
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:54,185
<i>just transfer their funds to
somewhere much less monitored.</i>

393
00:38:54,187 --> 00:38:55,255
"Less monitored." Like where?

394
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:58,390
<i>The Internet.</i>

395
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:08,867
She gets a fake ID,
she sends money to herself.

396
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:09,803
What does this mean?

397
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:13,874
<i>That it's time to start
considering the possibility...</i>

398
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:17,143
<i>that Margot ran away.</i>

399
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:22,115
Why would she do that?

400
00:39:22,816 --> 00:39:24,150
<i>That's what we don't know.</i>

401
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:28,552
Why would she do that? She called me
three times in the middle of the night.

402
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:29,854
Three times she called me. Why?

403
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:31,789
<i>We are going to figure out why.</i>

404
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,992
- <i>So what I want to look for now...</i>
- No, no, no.

405
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:35,028
No, no, no.

406
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:36,930
I know my daughter.

407
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:38,629
She did not run away.

408
00:40:37,957 --> 00:40:40,592
Ooh. This is a good angle.

409
00:40:41,294 --> 00:40:44,297
Also, to all my fans, I know this
vlog is a little late, but...

410
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:48,934
Favorite concert in the last year?
Definitely Twenty One Pilots.

411
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:52,104
Well, thank you
for the compliment, Lucy.

412
00:40:54,274 --> 00:40:57,509
Oh, this is a Fearless Core shirt.
Cost me, like, 40 bucks.

413
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:00,980
Um...

414
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,115
How... how would I be able
to see you?

415
00:41:06,752 --> 00:41:09,320
Well, you know what?
You guys, you keep commenting,

416
00:41:09,322 --> 00:41:10,622
but honestly if it's kind...

417
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:53,292
Hold on.

418
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,142
It's Uxie.

419
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,313
It can wipe out memories.
And it's kind of cute.

420
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:16,781
How'd you know I like Pokémon?

421
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:21,487
A lot of people, actually.

422
00:43:22,121 --> 00:43:23,388
I mean,
ever since they started chang...

423
00:43:33,198 --> 00:43:34,500
This one I took at a lake.

424
00:43:37,735 --> 00:43:39,904
This one I took at a forest.

425
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:43,242
That...

426
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:51,115
I'm Margot.

427
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:57,288
I'm 15. Almost 16.

428
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:01,993
Student.

429
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:06,030
San Jose.

430
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,901
What's that like?

431
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:19,578
Trust me,
it's probably better than this.

432
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:24,480
This is it.

433
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:28,286
Best place in the world
to do nothing.

434
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:36,727
You work 25 hours
on top of school?

435
00:45:25,109 --> 00:45:27,678
My dad doesn't know
I stopped going to piano.

436
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:37,622
He wouldn't get it.

437
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:45,563
Anyway, don't you guys have...

438
00:45:57,874 --> 00:45:58,842
So...

439
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:02,647
today is this mega babe's birthday.

440
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,352
Happy Birthday.

441
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:15,459
You know,
if she were still here today,

442
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:17,992
a hundred percent,
she'd be making us all her...

443
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:24,167
Come in!

444
00:46:28,104 --> 00:46:29,407
Hey, sweetheart. Um...

445
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:34,345
I... I...

446
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:37,113
forgot to say earlier...

447
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:39,417
Um...

448
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:45,454
It's, uh...

449
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:47,625
- Yeah, it's...
- Tuesday.

450
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:50,260
So, <i>The Voice...</i>

451
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:51,429
Um...

452
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,464
Elimination round.

453
00:46:56,734 --> 00:46:58,132
Yeah, of course.

454
00:46:58,134 --> 00:46:59,200
Still on?

455
00:46:59,202 --> 00:47:01,171
Yeah. Megan's gonna get cut.

456
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:03,873
Yeah, she is.
I'll see you...

457
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:06,009
- Bye.
- ...downstairs.

458
00:47:29,032 --> 00:47:30,801
<i>I'm sorry, David.
It's another dead end.</i>

459
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:34,839
You're sure you looked into
every one of them?

460
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:38,707
Every one. None of the YouCast
users Margot interacted with

461
00:47:38,709 --> 00:47:40,508
have a connection
to her disappearance.

462
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,178
- Even f...
- Even fish-n-chips.

463
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,713
Using the information
on her account,

464
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:47,281
we traced her
to a Kirchick's Diner,

465
00:47:47,283 --> 00:47:49,386
ten miles outside Pittsburgh.

466
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,721
I spoke to her and her manager,

467
00:47:52,021 --> 00:47:55,425
who confirmed with CCTV
that she was on a shift.

468
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:57,594
Checks out.

469
00:48:05,502 --> 00:48:06,469
I didn't know her.

470
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,107
I didn't know my daughter.

471
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:21,718
Couple years ago,

472
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,321
an angry neighbor
starts banging on my door.

473
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:27,889
When I asked her
what the trouble was,

474
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:32,295
she said she wanted the $25
that my son had stolen from her.

475
00:48:33,029 --> 00:48:34,631
Now, I didn't know
what she was talking about.

476
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:36,299
I know my son,

477
00:48:37,066 --> 00:48:39,135
and that did not sound like
the Robert I raised.

478
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,239
But as it turned out,
it was true.

479
00:48:44,474 --> 00:48:50,111
My son had gone house-to-house in
the neighborhood for two weeks,

480
00:48:50,113 --> 00:48:52,315
telling people
that he was my son

481
00:48:53,216 --> 00:48:59,287
and that he was raising money
for a fictional police charity

482
00:48:59,289 --> 00:49:01,157
called "Moms and Dads in Blue."

483
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:02,625
Hmm.

484
00:49:04,394 --> 00:49:05,462
Point is...

485
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,432
you don't always know your kid.

486
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:14,771
And that is never your fault.

487
00:49:18,575 --> 00:49:21,642
I have NCIC searching
for her vehicle in 16 states.

488
00:49:21,644 --> 00:49:24,077
Let's both try and catch up
on some sleep tonight.

489
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,047
Talk in the a.m.

490
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:26,816
What'd you do after?

491
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:30,386
With your son,
once you found out?

492
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:36,359
Um, I told my neighbor that...

493
00:49:37,326 --> 00:49:40,495
I had in fact
founded the charity,

494
00:49:40,497 --> 00:49:41,764
and I thanked her for the money.

495
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:47,336
But I will deny it
if you ever bring that up.

496
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:49,104
Okay.

497
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:55,310
Look, I hope you know how thankful
I am that you were assigned to us.

498
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:00,215
I just wish there wasn't
a case to be assigned to.

499
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:05,454
All right.
Shutting down.

500
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:06,856
- Yeah.
- Talk soon.

501
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:56,538
This is it.

502
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:01,743
Best place in the world
to do nothing.

503
00:51:04,313 --> 00:51:05,180
This is it.

504
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:20,820
<i>You've reached Detective
Sergeant Rosemary Vick.</i>

505
00:52:20,822 --> 00:52:22,357
<i>Leave a message.
I'll get back to you.</i>

506
00:52:22,658 --> 00:52:23,959
Vick, wake up!

507
00:52:24,526 --> 00:52:25,992
I know why
she was at that intersection.

508
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:28,461
She wasn't leaving town.

509
00:52:28,463 --> 00:52:31,033
She was driving to the spot she's been
visiting for the past five months.

510
00:52:31,833 --> 00:52:34,870
It's 3:45 a.m.
I'm headed there now.

511
00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:44,880
Hey.

512
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:46,682
Where are you?

513
00:52:48,617 --> 00:52:50,116
You told me she ran away, Vick.

514
00:52:50,118 --> 00:52:51,185
Are...

515
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:52,621
Are you at the lake?

516
00:52:53,487 --> 00:52:56,522
You told me she ran away.

517
00:52:56,524 --> 00:52:57,993
Okay, I'm heading there
right now.

518
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:01,562
Robert, honey,
just go back to sleep, okay?

519
00:53:02,097 --> 00:53:04,831
Okay. I need you
to stay calm, all right?

520
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,400
We're gonna figure this out
together.

521
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:11,505
What are you showing me?

522
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:14,843
This is her key chain.

523
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:17,713
Oh, my God.

524
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:22,683
Did you call the cops?

525
00:53:24,152 --> 00:53:25,754
I'm heading... I'm on my way!

526
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:29,290
You told me she ran away, Vick!

527
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:35,661
Good morning, Bay Area.
I'm Natalie Boyd.

528
00:53:35,663 --> 00:53:37,563
A terrifying development today

529
00:53:37,565 --> 00:53:40,900
as a vehicle matching that
of a missing San Jose teenager

530
00:53:40,902 --> 00:53:44,572
was discovered late last night
underneath a Santa Cruz lake.

531
00:53:45,207 --> 00:53:49,677
An operation is currently underway to
recover Margot Kim's Toyota Camry.

532
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:52,311
But at this moment,
we still don't know

533
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,850
whether the Evercreek High sophomore
is actually inside the vehicle.

534
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:17,805
Okay, doesn't look like there's
anyone at the front seat.

535
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:24,643
And now it looks like they're...

536
00:54:24,645 --> 00:54:25,946
Okay,
they're checking the trunk.

537
00:54:42,563 --> 00:54:45,231
Good morning. Thank you for
being here on such short notice.

538
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:47,399
I'm Detective Sergeant
Rosemary Vick,

539
00:54:47,401 --> 00:54:49,034
lead investigator on this case.

540
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,306
I am joined by David Kim,
Margot's father.

541
00:54:53,107 --> 00:54:55,574
We've provided you all
with a timeline of events,

542
00:54:55,576 --> 00:54:58,410
starting with last Thursday,
May 11th,

543
00:54:58,412 --> 00:55:00,445
when Margot first went missing.

544
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:01,682
That is yours to circulate.

545
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:04,618
But focusing on the events
of this morning,

546
00:55:04,952 --> 00:55:06,819
the Silicon Valley
Police Department

547
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:09,454
was able to recover
Miss Kim's vehicle.

548
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:11,056
And to answer
the most pressing question,

549
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,828
Margot Kim was not inside.

550
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:18,630
However, our examination
of the vehicle did reveal

551
00:55:18,632 --> 00:55:20,132
a small amount of blood

552
00:55:20,134 --> 00:55:22,801
on the passenger-side dashboard,

553
00:55:22,803 --> 00:55:26,339
blood that points
to a physical altercation,

554
00:55:26,974 --> 00:55:29,340
meaning that this case is now

555
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:32,079
officially being considered
an abduction.

556
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,647
Good afternoon.

557
00:55:35,649 --> 00:55:38,482
A search through the Santa
Cruz forest is now underway

558
00:55:38,484 --> 00:55:41,954
for a local teen whose car
was found dumped in a lake.

559
00:55:41,956 --> 00:55:44,555
Authorities are
asking anyone with information

560
00:55:44,557 --> 00:55:47,558
to please call the hotline
or 911 immediately.

561
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,628
Starting at 1:00 p.m.,

562
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,297
we'll be assigning every
volunteer to a search team.

563
00:55:52,299 --> 00:55:55,000
Each team is in charge
of a single section

564
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:57,503
of the critical
12-square-mile radius.

565
00:55:58,172 --> 00:55:59,437
Because of the steep ravines

566
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,439
and otherwise
unsafe topography

567
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,108
on the west side of the lake,

568
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,213
we have already cleared
the following zones.

569
00:56:07,014 --> 00:56:09,817
But still, there's a lot
of ground to cover.

570
00:56:12,552 --> 00:56:14,385
- Margot!
- Margot!

571
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:17,289
- Margot!
- Margot!

572
00:56:20,693 --> 00:56:23,394
It's been four
days since Margot Kim was last seen,

573
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:25,696
and so far,
nothing to show for it

574
00:56:25,698 --> 00:56:28,568
except for the torturous mystery
at its center.

575
00:56:30,037 --> 00:56:35,107
$2,500 in cash
was found in a manila envelope

576
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:36,643
on Margot's passenger seat.

577
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:39,177
Was it a runaway fund,

578
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:40,981
like the lead detective is
suggesting,

579
00:56:41,814 --> 00:56:43,050
or was it something more?

580
00:56:45,052 --> 00:56:48,821
We covered about, um,
half the search zone already,

581
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:52,792
and, um, tomorrow is a full day.

582
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,462
And the more people came,
the faster it went.

583
00:56:57,264 --> 00:56:58,098
Um...

584
00:56:58,531 --> 00:56:59,366
Can I?

585
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:02,136
So, if you have
some time tomorrow,

586
00:57:02,769 --> 00:57:05,538
we would... love the help.

587
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:15,846
This is obviously not
the outcome we wanted,

588
00:57:15,848 --> 00:57:17,715
but we will resume the search

589
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:20,421
the moment it is safe to
walk through the forest again.

590
00:57:21,288 --> 00:57:23,155
In the meantime, however,

591
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:25,758
the investigation will not stop

592
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:28,195
until we find Margot.

593
00:57:41,442 --> 00:57:43,342
I mean, listen,

594
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:45,645
I do not think it is my place
to say anything. I just...

595
00:57:45,979 --> 00:57:49,383
I feel that these problems
usually start in the household.

596
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,933
<i>She was...</i>

597
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,267
I'm sorry.

598
00:58:12,473 --> 00:58:13,873
She was my best friend.

599
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,483
I'm just a big believer
in community service.

600
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,816
Looking at all the things
that happened to Margot,

601
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:27,284
I just thought to myself,

602
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:29,088
"I think they could use
my help."

603
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,512
Don't lie to me.
Don't lie to me.

604
00:59:26,812 --> 00:59:29,115
You can't assist
in the investigation anymore.

605
00:59:31,117 --> 00:59:33,119
What? What does that...
What does that mean?

606
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,252
It means that
we can't have someone

607
00:59:35,254 --> 00:59:37,756
this close to the case
helping investigate it.

608
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:41,060
It's my fault for getting you
involved in the first place.

609
00:59:41,693 --> 00:59:44,228
I did it because we had
already lost so much time.

610
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:46,230
You're cutting me off?

611
00:59:46,232 --> 00:59:49,469
Every professional who should
be working on this case

612
00:59:50,236 --> 00:59:51,935
is working on this case.

613
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:54,305
All I'm trying to do
is to help you find my daughter!

614
00:59:54,307 --> 00:59:56,908
I know. But you can't
see things clearly.

615
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,313
Who's the one
who brought you to the car?

616
01:00:00,745 --> 01:00:03,847
Who's the one who found the lake
and brought you to the car?

617
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:06,118
If it wasn't for me... not you...

618
01:00:06,452 --> 01:00:08,051
you and I would both be thinking

619
01:00:08,053 --> 01:00:09,886
that my Margot ran away,
but because of me, we...

620
01:00:09,888 --> 01:00:11,390
We don't know
that she didn't run away.

621
01:00:11,723 --> 01:00:14,260
She had cash in her car.

622
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:16,360
But what we do know

623
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,430
is that a 17-year-old boy
is in the hospital...

624
01:00:19,432 --> 01:00:21,365
- He's gonna be fine.
- You broke his jaw!

625
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,602
- Mom?
- Robert! What...

626
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:28,173
Sweetheart, let me take care of this.
Please.

627
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:41,887
If you have a suspicion
about someone, that's fine.

628
01:00:43,088 --> 01:00:45,056
But then it is the police's job

629
01:00:46,124 --> 01:00:47,657
to look for proof,

630
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:51,129
not yours to act
on flakes of evidence.

631
01:00:56,268 --> 01:00:57,470
Vick,
I shouldn't have done that.

632
01:00:59,871 --> 01:01:01,840
From now on,
you just tell me what you need.

633
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:03,208
We need nothing from you.

634
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:09,481
I'm going back to the field.
Do not call me until I call you.

635
01:01:10,315 --> 01:01:13,151
- Vick, please.
- Get some sleep, Mr. Kim.

636
01:01:24,362 --> 01:01:26,429
Don't lie to me.
Don't walk away from me.

637
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:27,832
Don't walk away. Hey.

638
01:01:43,548 --> 01:01:44,416
Oh, shit.

639
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:48,751
- Hey! Stop!
- Stop! Stop! Hey!

640
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:50,086
- Hey! Stop!
- Son of a bitch!

641
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:51,056
Shit!

642
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,625
- Oh, shit!
- Get off!

643
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:56,261
What'd you do to her?

644
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:57,761
What'd you do to her?

645
01:02:57,821 --> 01:03:02,126
Has anyone even considered the possibility
that it was an absolute stranger?

646
01:03:02,594 --> 01:03:07,064
Some sick perv in the middle of
the woods sees a little girl...

647
01:05:50,928 --> 01:05:51,961
Looking for
something to drink?

648
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:54,229
- Yeah.
- Coffee?

649
01:05:54,231 --> 01:05:55,630
Yeah, coffee would be
awesome, thanks.

650
01:05:55,632 --> 01:05:56,600
All right.

651
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,305
No, you know what,

652
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:04,040
you've been probably straight-chugging
caffeine the last three days.

653
01:06:04,675 --> 01:06:07,642
I am going to make you
some tea.

654
01:06:07,644 --> 01:06:09,780
Herbal.

655
01:06:10,747 --> 01:06:14,585
Um, I got to go to my car for a minute.
I'll be right back, yeah?

656
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:10,506
Hmm.

657
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:12,675
How's the detective?

658
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:16,412
She working on any new leads?

659
01:07:19,115 --> 01:07:19,983
No.

660
01:07:20,349 --> 01:07:21,317
She's not.

661
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:35,331
What was your relationship
like with Margot?

662
01:07:38,001 --> 01:07:38,869
What do you mean?

663
01:07:39,468 --> 01:07:40,503
You guys hung out,
right?

664
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:44,206
Sure.

665
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:47,810
You know, it was, um...

666
01:07:51,213 --> 01:07:52,748
You know,
we didn't hang out much, but...

667
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:56,152
You know, it was just...

668
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:57,955
When's the last time
you saw her, by the way?

669
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:03,125
Um...

670
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:05,225
You know what,
I'd have to think...

671
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,398
I think this needs some honey.

672
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:21,611
Who was that?

673
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:24,447
Work.

674
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,216
Oh, yeah. Uh...

675
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,950
What have they been saying
to you this whole time?

676
01:08:29,952 --> 01:08:31,251
Going back to
the previous question,

677
01:08:31,253 --> 01:08:32,421
when's the last time
you saw her?

678
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:36,124
Dude...

679
01:08:36,592 --> 01:08:37,927
I can barely remember.

680
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:40,761
But you know what, let's...

681
01:08:40,763 --> 01:08:42,598
let's get our minds off this
for a sec, huh?

682
01:08:43,466 --> 01:08:47,069
I feel like we're just gonna drive
each other crazy talking about it.

683
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:49,105
Hey, is your tea okay?

684
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:51,040
You still want that coffee?

685
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:53,976
- "Last night was fun."
- What was that?

686
01:09:00,516 --> 01:09:02,217
"I feel so weird
doing this."

687
01:09:05,253 --> 01:09:06,455
"Don't tell your father."

688
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:10,191
"He'd kill me."

689
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,294
"Seriously,
he'd murder me."

690
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:17,533
And then
seven different times:

691
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:19,502
"See you tonight."

692
01:09:21,403 --> 01:09:22,538
What'd you do
to my daughter?

693
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:28,044
What'd you do
to my daughter?

694
01:09:31,914 --> 01:09:33,348
I can explain, all right?

695
01:09:35,417 --> 01:09:37,618
But you know what,
let's calm down.

696
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,155
- Let's grab a seat.
- What'd you do to my daughter?

697
01:09:39,855 --> 01:09:40,823
Wait.

698
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:42,290
Stop!

699
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:44,524
What the...

700
01:09:44,526 --> 01:09:45,993
What'd you do to her?

701
01:09:45,995 --> 01:09:47,861
- Please!
- What'd you do to her?

702
01:09:47,863 --> 01:09:50,966
What'd you do to her?
What were you doing with her?

703
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:54,070
Weed!

704
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:05,047
- What?
- Weed!

705
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:09,952
I was smoking her out.

706
01:10:27,335 --> 01:10:29,368
When you guys all came back
from New Year's...

707
01:10:30,672 --> 01:10:32,041
...she found my piece.

708
01:10:33,675 --> 01:10:35,343
She wanted to try it, and...

709
01:10:36,544 --> 01:10:37,679
it just kept happening.

710
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:40,216
You gave drugs to my daughter?

711
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:43,549
I promised her
I wouldn't tell.

712
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:45,485
So she would come to you
in the middle of the night

713
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:47,754
and you would give her weed
and do God knows what else?

714
01:10:47,756 --> 01:10:48,890
That's it.

715
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:52,560
We'd get high and talk. I swear.

716
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:57,133
Look, I know
how wrong all this sounds,

717
01:10:57,365 --> 01:10:59,267
and I know I should've
told you sooner, but...

718
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:02,971
Look, I didn't think it had
anything to do with this.

719
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:06,441
What kind of a brother are you?

720
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:10,879
You're asking me?

721
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:17,583
You come in here and accuse me of
something un-fucking-speakable,

722
01:11:17,585 --> 01:11:19,687
and you're wondering
what kind of family I am?

723
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:25,927
Do you want to know why
she hated those piano lessons?

724
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:29,929
It's because
every time she would walk in,

725
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:32,767
she would see that thing and she
would think about her mother.

726
01:11:34,769 --> 01:11:35,670
She told you that?

727
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,109
She told you that
and not me? Why?

728
01:11:41,309 --> 01:11:44,078
Because you never asked.

729
01:11:45,246 --> 01:11:46,648
Ever since Pam,

730
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:49,549
you stopped talking to Margot
about the only thing

731
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:51,352
that's been on her mind
the last two years.

732
01:11:54,289 --> 01:11:56,124
She needed you
to talk to her...

733
01:11:57,926 --> 01:11:59,027
not the other way around.

734
01:12:14,275 --> 01:12:15,877
I just thought
it would fix itself.

735
01:12:30,325 --> 01:12:31,192
<i>David.</i>

736
01:12:32,026 --> 01:12:33,328
<i>We... We got him.</i>

737
01:12:34,762 --> 01:12:36,396
<i>His name is Randy Cartoff.</i>

738
01:12:55,515 --> 01:12:56,383
Davy?

739
01:12:56,617 --> 01:12:58,452
Oh, God.

740
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:01,956
- Davy.
- Oh, God.

741
01:13:07,527 --> 01:13:12,566
<i>This is Eyewitness
News with live breaking news.</i>

742
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,500
Good morning. I'm Faustine Rea.

743
01:13:15,502 --> 01:13:17,836
A parent's worst nightmare
comes true this morning

744
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:18,772
for David Kim.

745
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:20,273
In a shocking and thoroughly

746
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:21,908
mind-boggling conclusion

747
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,842
to a story that's captivated
the Bay Area,

748
01:13:23,844 --> 01:13:26,546
Margot Kim,
missing now for five days,

749
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,549
has just been
tragically declared dead.

750
01:13:30,051 --> 01:13:32,419
Why? A taped confession.

751
01:13:32,853 --> 01:13:35,587
Randy Cartoff,
released just six years ago

752
01:13:35,589 --> 01:13:38,359
for felony drug possession
and sexual assault,

753
01:13:38,592 --> 01:13:42,696
uploaded the confession online
before taking his own life.

754
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:44,397
We're going to show you

755
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,563
a segment of

756
01:13:45,565 --> 01:13:46,598
the three-minute video now,

757
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,734
but please be warned:

758
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:49,235
the following contains

759
01:13:49,237 --> 01:13:50,336
graphic descriptions

760
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:51,872
and disturbing content.

761
01:13:52,273 --> 01:13:54,208
Viewer discretion is advised.

762
01:13:57,945 --> 01:13:59,314
Dear girl in the green car,

763
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:02,115
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

764
01:14:03,384 --> 01:14:05,953
And I'm sorry for not listening to
you when you begged me to stop.

765
01:14:08,755 --> 01:14:11,959
I'm sorry for beating you
and crushing you

766
01:14:13,126 --> 01:14:16,331
and tossing you with your suitcases
so no one would ever find you.

767
01:14:19,466 --> 01:14:21,501
I thought this would be easy,
but it isn't.

768
01:14:26,473 --> 01:14:28,441
When we arrived
at his Morgan Hill residence,

769
01:14:28,443 --> 01:14:30,241
Mr. Cartoff was deceased,

770
01:14:30,243 --> 01:14:32,447
seemingly by
a self-inflicted gun wound.

771
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,480
Sometimes these confessions
are hoaxes,

772
01:14:35,482 --> 01:14:37,082
but based on his story,

773
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:39,150
we were able to return
to the lake site,

774
01:14:39,152 --> 01:14:43,424
where we discovered trace DNA
matching that of Mr. Cartoff

775
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:46,693
in critical areas
of the search zone.

776
01:14:48,429 --> 01:14:50,263
I've already spoken
to her father.

777
01:14:51,665 --> 01:14:53,531
But at this point
in the investigation,

778
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:55,335
we are very confident...

779
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:58,872
that Miss Kim's life was taken

780
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:01,375
on her way out of town.

781
01:15:01,775 --> 01:15:04,109
<i>A private vigil
will be held for Miss Kim</i>

782
01:15:04,111 --> 01:15:06,211
<i>in downtown San Jose this week.</i>

783
01:15:13,687 --> 01:15:15,022
It still doesn't make sense.

784
01:15:18,225 --> 01:15:19,993
Where's the car that he took her in?
Where's the...

785
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:21,862
the suitcases?

786
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:24,364
Did he...
did he clean up the blood?

787
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:27,200
Vick, who is this guy?

788
01:15:28,135 --> 01:15:29,102
I don't know.

789
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:30,670
I wish I had an answer.

790
01:15:32,806 --> 01:15:35,409
All I know,
and all you need to know,

791
01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:38,677
is that this had
nothing to do with you.

792
01:15:43,549 --> 01:15:44,484
Yes, it did.

793
01:15:54,528 --> 01:15:56,027
I am so sorry for everything

794
01:15:56,029 --> 01:15:57,097
that happened to your daughter.

795
01:15:58,298 --> 01:15:59,797
And I am so sorry for everything

796
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:00,666
that happened to you.

797
01:16:03,036 --> 01:16:04,002
And if there's anything

798
01:16:04,004 --> 01:16:04,871
I can do for you,

799
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:07,773
please do not hesitate to call.

800
01:16:14,281 --> 01:16:15,482
- Okay.
- Okay.

801
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:20,779
- Make sure to get all the water out.
- Are these ready?

802
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:33,359
Go wake up Daddy.

803
01:17:37,129 --> 01:17:38,964
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

804
01:17:39,665 --> 01:17:41,965
Wake up.

805
01:17:41,967 --> 01:17:43,335
- Wake up.
- Okay, all right.

806
01:17:43,603 --> 01:17:45,738
Margot, show Daddy
what you made in school.

807
01:17:55,681 --> 01:17:56,682
That's not...

808
01:19:28,773 --> 01:19:29,742
I'm Margot.

809
01:20:21,092 --> 01:20:23,326
<i>Hello?</i>

810
01:20:23,328 --> 01:20:25,462
<i>Hi. I'm wondering
if I could speak to Hannah?</i>

811
01:20:25,464 --> 01:20:26,431
<i>Speaking.</i>

812
01:20:26,665 --> 01:20:28,030
<i>Hi, I'm calling in regards</i>

813
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,566
<i>to my daughter, Margot Kim.</i>

814
01:20:29,568 --> 01:20:31,901
<i>You spoke to her online
as "mkmania."</i>

815
01:20:31,903 --> 01:20:33,069
<i>Oh. Um...</i>

816
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:34,303
<i>You must have the wrong number.</i>

817
01:20:34,305 --> 01:20:36,272
<i>I'm talent, not representation.</i>

818
01:20:36,274 --> 01:20:37,840
<i>But I can connect you
to my agent if you'd like.</i>

819
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:39,175
<i>So you work as a waitress</i>

820
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:40,476
<i>part-time, then?</i>

821
01:20:40,478 --> 01:20:41,778
<i>You told the detective you were</i>

822
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:42,980
<i>on a shift when she called.</i>

823
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:44,849
<i>Uh, what detective?</i>

824
01:20:45,516 --> 01:20:47,416
<i>I don't understand.
Detective Vick.</i>

825
01:20:47,418 --> 01:20:49,686
<i>She called you four days ago,
and you told her</i>

826
01:20:49,688 --> 01:20:52,855
<i>- you were on a shift.
- Sir, I never got a call from the police.</i>

827
01:20:52,857 --> 01:20:53,991
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

828
01:20:54,425 --> 01:20:55,593
<i>Maybe I'm not being clear.</i>

829
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:59,964
<i>On YouCast, you've been chatting
with my daughter for months.</i>

830
01:21:00,498 --> 01:21:02,735
<i>Your username is "fish-n-chips."</i>

831
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:04,703
<i>Your mother was in the hospital.</i>

832
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:06,839
<i>Right?</i>

833
01:21:09,507 --> 01:21:10,908
<i>What's YouCast?</i>

834
01:21:17,148 --> 01:21:19,248
<i>You've reached Detective
Sergeant Rosemary Vick.</i>

835
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:21,484
<i>Leave a message. I'll get back to you.</i>

836
01:21:21,486 --> 01:21:24,553
Vick, this is David Kim.
Something doesn't add up.

837
01:21:24,555 --> 01:21:26,088
Call me back
as soon as you get this, okay?

838
01:21:34,499 --> 01:21:36,999
- <i>SVPD.</i>
- Hi. Yes. This is an emergency.

839
01:21:37,001 --> 01:21:39,402
I need to speak
to Detective Rosemary Vick.

840
01:21:39,404 --> 01:21:42,371
- Can you connect me, please?
- <i>I'm sorry, sir, that's not possible.</i>

841
01:21:42,373 --> 01:21:45,574
- <i>Uh, what is this regarding?</i>
- No. Um... This is David Kim.

842
01:21:45,576 --> 01:21:47,943
I need to speak to Detective
Rosemary Vick. V-I...

843
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:51,382
<i>Mr. Kim. I am so sorry
to hear about Margot.</i>

844
01:21:51,783 --> 01:21:54,216
- Thank you.
- <i>We are all so torn up about it here.</i>

845
01:21:54,218 --> 01:21:56,252
- Yeah, thank you.
- <i>Especially Rosemary.</i>

846
01:21:56,254 --> 01:21:58,587
<i>I have never seen someone
so invested in a case.</i>

847
01:21:58,589 --> 01:22:00,955
- Yeah, I know.
- <i>From the moment she volunteered to lead it,</i>

848
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:03,058
- <i>the way she handled the investigation...</i>
- Wait.

849
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:05,060
<i>...and really dealt with
the media, I mean...</i>

850
01:22:05,062 --> 01:22:07,231
- Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
- She...

851
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,169
- Did you say "volunteered"?
- <i>Sorry?</i>

852
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:14,172
Y-You said she volunteered.

853
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,908
No. I was led
to believe that she...

854
01:22:17,442 --> 01:22:19,610
she was assigned to the case, right?
She was assigned.

855
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:22,780
<i>No. She definitely volunteered.</i>

856
01:22:27,785 --> 01:22:29,387
<i>Unfortunately, though, I...</i>

857
01:22:29,587 --> 01:22:31,756
<i>I still can't patch you
through dispatch.</i>

858
01:22:32,055 --> 01:22:35,091
<i>She's probably on her way
to Margot's vigil, though.</i>

859
01:22:38,262 --> 01:22:41,332
<i>If you'd like, I can connect you
to her work voice mail instead.</i>

860
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:53,276
<i>Mr. Kim?</i>

861
01:23:07,257 --> 01:23:08,258
<i>Mr. Kim?</i>

862
01:23:18,435 --> 01:23:19,369
Actually, can you...

863
01:23:20,771 --> 01:23:22,405
connect me to
the deputy sheriff, please?

864
01:26:25,655 --> 01:26:29,791
Ms. Vick, as your counsel was
informed, by signing this document,

865
01:26:29,793 --> 01:26:32,827
you hereby verify
the confession you provide today

866
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:34,628
pertaining to the crimes
you are accused of

867
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:36,498
after your arrest one week ago.

868
01:26:37,433 --> 01:26:39,366
The DA's office
will then consider leniency

869
01:26:39,368 --> 01:26:41,236
on any charges related
to the case,

870
01:26:42,604 --> 01:26:44,339
including first-degree murder.

871
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:48,142
Excuse us.
We're taking you now

872
01:26:48,144 --> 01:26:49,643
to San Jose, California,

873
01:26:49,645 --> 01:26:50,878
where we're getting word now

874
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,014
that a law enforcement officer

875
01:26:53,016 --> 01:26:56,717
has just been taken into custody
at the vigil for a local teen

876
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,687
who's been missing
since last Thursday.

877
01:27:02,826 --> 01:27:06,261
<i>Let's start with Thursday,
May 11th, when Margot Kim went missing.</i>

878
01:27:07,163 --> 01:27:08,330
What happened that night?

879
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:11,700
- I got a phone call.
- And who was calling?

880
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,337
My son.

881
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:19,508
<i>Mom.</i>

882
01:27:20,309 --> 01:27:21,510
<i>I made a big mistake.</i>

883
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:24,013
<i>I think I need to call 911.</i>

884
01:27:24,214 --> 01:27:25,912
<i>What did you do
after hearing the call?</i>

885
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:28,517
- <i>I met him.</i>
<i>- Where?</i>

886
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:31,820
<i>Near Barbosa Lake. He was
standing on the edge of a ravine.</i>

887
01:27:33,089 --> 01:27:34,923
<i>What did Robert
tell you when you got there?</i>

888
01:27:35,924 --> 01:27:37,457
He said,
"There's a girl down there.

889
01:27:37,459 --> 01:27:39,661
I accidentally pushed a girl
down there."

890
01:27:40,362 --> 01:27:41,231
I asked him why.

891
01:27:41,563 --> 01:27:42,464
What did he say?

892
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,965
You need to understand
that my son

893
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:46,767
is not like other kids.
He's different.

894
01:27:46,769 --> 01:27:47,701
He can be very...

895
01:27:47,703 --> 01:27:49,505
What did he say?

896
01:27:52,741 --> 01:27:55,308
<i>Six months ago,
Robert recognized Margot</i>

897
01:27:55,310 --> 01:27:56,678
<i>on a live blogging website.</i>

898
01:28:01,984 --> 01:28:03,852
<i>He'd liked her
since grade school.</i>

899
01:28:09,057 --> 01:28:10,260
<i>Knew all about her life.</i>

900
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:16,031
<i>Her interests.</i>

901
01:28:19,902 --> 01:28:20,969
<i>So, what did he do?</i>

902
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:24,807
<i>Made up a story.</i>

903
01:28:26,942 --> 01:28:27,843
<i>A new identity.</i>

904
01:28:28,577 --> 01:28:30,644
This one I took at a forest.

905
01:28:30,646 --> 01:28:32,579
<i>For six months,
they were friends.</i>

906
01:28:32,581 --> 01:28:35,250
You work 25 hours
on top of school?

907
01:28:37,219 --> 01:28:39,353
<i>It was just role-playing.
It was harmless.</i>

908
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,991
<i>Until the money.</i>

909
01:28:44,793 --> 01:28:46,662
<i>She found his username
on Venmo.</i>

910
01:28:47,796 --> 01:28:51,533
<i>She sent $2,500
to cover hospital expenses.</i>

911
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,303
<i>Expenses that didn't exist.</i>

912
01:28:55,403 --> 01:28:56,572
<i>She was a good kid.</i>

913
01:28:57,606 --> 01:28:59,440
<i>So he decided
to give her money back.</i>

914
01:29:00,909 --> 01:29:02,476
He had to come clean.
It was over.

915
01:29:03,912 --> 01:29:05,547
Why didn't he just
give it to her at school?

916
01:29:06,615 --> 01:29:09,184
Margot could've reacted
the wrong way in public.

917
01:29:10,518 --> 01:29:12,520
Robert does not like
that kind of attention.

918
01:29:15,924 --> 01:29:16,959
<i>So he followed her.</i>

919
01:29:18,593 --> 01:29:19,527
<i>He followed her.</i>

920
01:29:20,762 --> 01:29:22,394
<i>And what was Margot doing</i>

921
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:24,297
<i>when your son arrived
at the lake?</i>

922
01:29:24,299 --> 01:29:25,868
<i>Getting high in her car.</i>

923
01:29:26,134 --> 01:29:27,903
- Then what happened?
- He got in.

924
01:29:28,804 --> 01:29:30,371
She screamed. She hit him.

925
01:29:30,671 --> 01:29:32,839
Before he could even realize
that he was bleeding,

926
01:29:32,841 --> 01:29:35,507
she was running, calling for
help, and he ran after her.

927
01:29:35,509 --> 01:29:37,244
<i>It was pitch-black.</i>

928
01:29:41,216 --> 01:29:44,253
<i>He was not trying to hurt her.
He was trying to explain.</i>

929
01:29:44,752 --> 01:29:49,421
But she was punching him and
screaming, and he just... he reacted.

930
01:29:49,423 --> 01:29:51,126
He... he pushed back.

931
01:29:52,593 --> 01:29:53,527
And she fell.

932
01:29:55,463 --> 01:29:56,298
Just...

933
01:29:57,665 --> 01:29:58,597
just disappeared.

934
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:02,971
So, your son calls you,

935
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,537
asks you to help
cover up a murder...

936
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:06,574
No. No.

937
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,311
It was my decision.

938
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,945
Baby?
I don't want you calling anyone.

939
01:30:11,947 --> 01:30:13,714
Mommy's gonna take care
of everything.

940
01:30:14,016 --> 01:30:15,317
<i>It was my decision.</i>

941
01:30:16,918 --> 01:30:17,919
<i>Not his.</i>

942
01:30:19,388 --> 01:30:20,922
<i>So, now you're
looking down a ravine.</i>

943
01:30:21,622 --> 01:30:23,491
<i>- Did you go down?
- I tried.</i>

944
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:26,425
But it was narrow, jagged,
impossible without SAR.

945
01:30:26,427 --> 01:30:29,229
- So, how did you figure that sh...
- That she was dead?

946
01:30:29,231 --> 01:30:33,268
It was narrow, jagged, and at
least 50 feet to rock bottom.

947
01:30:34,535 --> 01:30:36,003
And it was dead quiet.

948
01:30:37,071 --> 01:30:40,407
So you helped your son.

949
01:30:40,409 --> 01:30:43,778
<i>I dumped the car in the lake
and took charge of the investigation.</i>

950
01:30:45,213 --> 01:30:47,148
<i>I convinced David
his daughter ran away.</i>

951
01:30:48,716 --> 01:30:50,918
<i>Said forensics had
Margot's hard drive.</i>

952
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,020
<i>And told
the law enforcement team</i>

953
01:30:55,022 --> 01:30:57,223
<i>we'd already cleared the zone
I knew her body was in.</i>

954
01:30:57,225 --> 01:30:58,891
<i>But still,
it was only a matter of time</i>

955
01:30:58,893 --> 01:30:59,894
<i>before they'd find the spot.</i>

956
01:31:02,063 --> 01:31:03,831
Which is why
I needed a confession.

957
01:31:06,435 --> 01:31:08,502
It was the only thing
that would make it stop.

958
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:12,006
So you drugged up
an ex-con you knew

959
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:13,607
and fed him a script.

960
01:31:16,378 --> 01:31:17,645
Was it really a suicide?

961
01:31:24,051 --> 01:31:24,986
He's my son.

962
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:32,526
<i>Do you know what prison would do
to someone like him?</i>

963
01:31:39,233 --> 01:31:40,368
He made a mistake.

964
01:31:47,507 --> 01:31:50,843
For those of you just joining,
we are now following the police SUV

965
01:31:50,845 --> 01:31:54,313
transporting Detective Vick
and the father of Miss Kim...

966
01:31:54,315 --> 01:31:56,782
<i>So, after your arrest,
on the way to the station,</i>

967
01:31:56,784 --> 01:32:00,019
<i>you didn't say a word to anyone
until Mr. Kim asked you</i>

968
01:32:00,021 --> 01:32:01,722
<i>was his daughter actually dead.</i>

969
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,691
What did you tell him?

970
01:32:04,025 --> 01:32:05,224
I said even if Margot

971
01:32:05,226 --> 01:32:06,358
had survived the fall she took

972
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:07,560
it wouldn't have mattered.

973
01:32:07,795 --> 01:32:08,961
She still would've had to live

974
01:32:08,963 --> 01:32:10,498
five days without water.

975
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:12,733
And how did David respond?

976
01:32:14,902 --> 01:32:16,603
<i>He told them
to turn the car around.</i>

977
01:32:18,739 --> 01:32:19,672
<i>Why?</i>

978
01:32:21,909 --> 01:32:23,444
<i>He said it'd been two days.</i>

979
01:32:23,878 --> 01:32:25,980
And hold on a second.

980
01:32:26,646 --> 01:32:29,517
<i>She'd only have to live
without water for two days.</i>

981
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:31,682
And it looks as though

982
01:32:31,684 --> 01:32:32,987
they're making
a U-turn right now.

983
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:34,687
<i>There was a storm
on Monday.</i>

984
01:32:35,423 --> 01:32:37,256
They're heading off
in the other direction.

985
01:32:45,299 --> 01:32:47,332
We're currently
watching live footage

986
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:49,001
from our affiliates
in the Bay Area

987
01:32:49,003 --> 01:32:50,469
of a recovery operation

988
01:32:50,471 --> 01:32:52,371
for missing teen Margot Kim,

989
01:32:52,373 --> 01:32:54,373
who authorities now believe
is at the bottom of

990
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:56,208
this Northern California ravine.

991
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:58,177
Presumed dead only hours ago,

992
01:32:58,179 --> 01:33:01,413
the search for Margot Kim
is revitalized this evening

993
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:03,348
after a suspect in custody

994
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:07,052
has provided authorities
with Miss Kim's exact location.

995
01:33:07,054 --> 01:33:08,853
The only question that remains:

996
01:33:08,855 --> 01:33:11,292
is Margot still alive,

997
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:13,724
or is it already too late?

998
01:33:13,726 --> 01:33:15,860
We are continuing
to monitor the ground,

999
01:33:15,862 --> 01:33:18,896
as it appears that everyone
is still just waiting

1000
01:33:18,898 --> 01:33:20,898
for any update
on the operation below.

1001
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,867
But hold on. Hold on.

1002
01:33:22,869 --> 01:33:24,403
We are just getting word now

1003
01:33:24,405 --> 01:33:26,338
that rescue responders
are beginning an ascent.

1004
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,240
Again, for our viewers,
we do not know

1005
01:33:28,242 --> 01:33:30,708
what we're about to see here
as we get a peek around...

1006
01:33:30,710 --> 01:33:32,110
And there she is.

1007
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:33,678
We are getting
a closer look now,

1008
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,713
as two rescue responders are
pulling up

1009
01:33:35,715 --> 01:33:39,284
what appears to be Margot Kim
in a body basket

1010
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:42,521
- to the top of this ravine here.
- Again, we just want to warn our viewers

1011
01:33:42,523 --> 01:33:45,257
that we do not know
what state she's in,

1012
01:33:45,259 --> 01:33:47,292
as we get a look
at Margot's father there.

1013
01:33:47,294 --> 01:33:49,595
But they are making their way
up to the top.

1014
01:33:49,597 --> 01:33:51,798
And it looks like
responders have gotten her up.

1015
01:33:52,065 --> 01:33:54,132
Again, no word yet
as to her status.

1016
01:33:54,134 --> 01:33:55,900
And there
you can see her father,

1017
01:33:55,902 --> 01:33:57,569
as it appears
that Search and Rescue

1018
01:33:57,571 --> 01:34:00,238
is now preparing
to lift Margot's body basket

1019
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:02,006
onto a stretcher
they've just prepared.

1020
01:34:02,008 --> 01:34:04,075
Again, this is
live footage here,

1021
01:34:04,077 --> 01:34:07,311
as Margot Kim, who has been
missing for the last week,

1022
01:34:07,313 --> 01:34:10,148
is now being lifted
onto an emergency...

1023
01:36:53,154 --> 01:36:58,154
