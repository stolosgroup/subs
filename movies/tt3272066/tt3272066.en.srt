00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,417
<i>The past
can haunt a man.</i>

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,333
<i>That's what they say.</i>

5
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,083
<i>And the past is just a series
of moments.</i>

6
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:02,333
<i>Each one... perfect.</i>

7
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>Complete.</i>

8
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,292
<i>A bead on the necklace of time.</i>

9
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:38,000
<i>The past doesn't haunt us.</i>

10
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,292
<i>Wouldn't even recognize us.</i>

11
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:45,542
<i>If there are ghosts
to be found...</i>

12
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,417
<i>it's us who haunt the past.</i>

13
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,625
You lost your queen.

14
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,375
Care to find her again?

15
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,417
Maybe another time.

16
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,458
You're late.

17
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:22,375
"Late" is a construct
of linear time.

18
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,542
We don't deal in that.

19
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:28,750
And yet, we charge by the hour.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,833
Your first appointment's
already in.

21
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:34,167
Who is it?

22
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,542
Your old pal from the forces.

23
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,167
The one who never pays.

24
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,708
Hank.

25
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,917
Hey, Bannister.

26
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,542
How you been?

27
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,958
Got turfed out of the place
I was crashin' at.

28
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,500
Land baron?

29
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,708
You know it.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,958
They stealin' all the drylands.

31
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,792
I've been missin' my old place.

32
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,875
I'd like to see Angie again.

33
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,417
'Course.

34
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,083
<i>It used to be
you couldn't go back again.</i>

35
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,083
<i>But time is no longer
a one-way stream.</i>

36
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:17,208
<i>Memory is the boat
that sails against its current.</i>

37
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,625
<i>And I'm the oarsman.</i>

38
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,875
<i>When the waters rose
and war broke out...</i>

39
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:27,500
<i>there wasn't a lot to look
forward to...</i>

40
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:30,833
<i>so people began looking back.</i>

41
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:34,417
<i>The tank started
as an interrogation tool...</i>

42
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,792
<i>and since then...</i>

43
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,042
<i>nostalgia's become
a way of life.</i>

44
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,333
Mic.

45
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:41,958
<i>But for Watts and me,
it's a living.</i>

46
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,083
Synaptic map complete.
Ready for the lull.

47
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,500
You're going on a journey.

48
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,833
A journey through memory.

49
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,292
Your destination?

50
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,583
A place and time
you've been before.

51
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,917
To reach it...

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,333
all you have to do
is follow my voice.

53
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:13,083
It's summer. 13 years ago.

54
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,167
You're in the fields
behind your father's house.

55
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,375
You pick up the ball.

56
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,083
<i>Ah!</i>

57
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,417
<i>Come on, Angie. Drop it.</i>

58
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,125
Come on, drop it, Angie.
Come on.

59
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:48,625
Yeah, you're a good girl.

60
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay. You ready? You ready?

61
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,167
<i>Go get it.</i>

62
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,500
<i>Come here, baby. Come here.</i>

63
00:05:58,583 --> 00:06:00,083
<i>Come here, drop it.</i>

64
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:04,792
<i>Aww! That's a good girl. Yeah.
You're such a good girl.</i>

65
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,083
<i>Come on, you ready?</i>

66
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,333
You wanna go again?

67
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,667
Go get it.

68
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:14,083
<i>Go get the ball, Angie.</i>

69
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,833
I love that damn dog.

70
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,333
I'm cash-strapped,
but I got these.

71
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,333
You know what baca will do
if you don't get off it, right?

72
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,750
Well, nothin' worse than
what the world's already done.

73
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,250
You know how it was.

74
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,500
You two served.

75
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,875
I heard you were
a damn good shot.

76
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:35,500
Mm. Only after
a couple of drinks.

77
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,583
And if I aimed
one man to the right.

78
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not quite enough, but...

79
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:45,292
- I can get you back next time.
- No, it's on the house.

80
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,750
Thank you.

81
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,333
You keep putting shit
on the house

82
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:52,708
for your war buddies...

83
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,500
the roof's liable to cave in.

84
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,958
We'll be fine, Watts.
Nostalgia never goes out of style.

85
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,958
<i>Truth is, nothing is more
addictive than the past.</i>

86
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:07,250
<i>Who wouldn't want to be
reunited with a loved one?</i>

87
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,583
<i>Or relive the most meaningful
moments of their life?</i>

88
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,667
<i>Look at those toes.</i>

89
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:17,833
Can Mommy kiss the toesies?

90
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:22,000
<i>Mommy's special girl.</i>

91
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:26,042
<i>But memories, even good
ones, have a voracious appetite.</i>

92
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,708
<i>If you're not careful,
they consume you.</i>

93
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:35,583
Don't worry, my flower.
I love you.

94
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>I'll always take care of you.</i>

95
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,625
Hey, Elsa.

96
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,125
Here. Take it home.

97
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,500
You always revisit
the same memory.

98
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,208
This way, you can
watch it anytime...

99
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,833
instead of wasting your money
on the tank every week.

100
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:53,958
Thanks.

101
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,750
But it's not the same.

102
00:07:55,833 --> 00:08:00,250
In the reminiscence,
I can feel his arms around me.

103
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,625
Nothing compares.

104
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,708
Thought you were worried
about the roof caving in.

105
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,583
I'm tired of staring
at his pasty ass.

106
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:12,375
She needs to quit being
sentimental and move the hell on.

107
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,125
I'm headin' home.

108
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,667
Here. Have some.

109
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,125
It'll help with the pain.

110
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,792
You think I can't tell
when you're hurting?

111
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,250
Well, I have the leg.
What's your excuse?

112
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:52,792
I work for you.

113
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,167
We have another appointment?

114
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,250
No.

115
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,000
We're closed.

116
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,125
I'm sorry. I know it's late.

117
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,167
I lost my keys on the way home
from work.

118
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,583
I've looked for hours,
but I can't find them anywhere.

119
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,333
Call a locksmith.

120
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,917
<i>It's bad for
business, but it's true.</i>

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,500
<i>There are certain moments
that never leave you.</i>

122
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,583
<i>Like the moment
I first saw her.</i>

123
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,375
We can give her a quick nudge.

124
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:27,583
Thank you.

125
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,458
What is that for?

126
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,500
Protects everyone.

127
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:40,250
Ensures that we don't have you remember
anything you don't want us to know.

128
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,083
Do you think you can
find my keys?

129
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:45,292
That depends.
Are they lost or forgotten?

130
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,750
Forgotten things can always be
fished up and dusted off.

131
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,250
But the lost, those things people
never really took much notice of...

132
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,708
till they were gone.

133
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,625
They're defined
by their absence.

134
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,583
You can't remember something
that never made an impression.

135
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:01,250
Let's say the keys
are misplaced.

136
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,667
It's your money.

137
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,125
Just take a seat.

138
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:13,042
Thiopental. Relaxes the neural
pathways for the prompts.

139
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,125
It won't hurt.
Just a little pinch.

140
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:17,875
Okay?

141
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,208
Sedative will kick in soon.

142
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,792
If you'd liked to get undressed,
we provide modesty suits...

143
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,000
so I can slip out while you...

144
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,792
You're gonna see it all anyway,
aren't you?

145
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,792
You'll have to lose those.

146
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,625
So, we never go over 30 volts.

147
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:49,625
You don't need much to unlock
a flood of memories.

148
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,125
Trick is finding the right one.

149
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,542
Relax. It always
works out fine.

150
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't say "always."

151
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,167
"Always" makes promises
it can't keep.

152
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:05,917
I'm Mae, by the way.

153
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,958
Nick.

154
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:14,375
Let's get this over with,
shall we?

155
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:22,333
You're going on a journey.
A journey through memory.

156
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,500
Your destination?

157
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,208
A place and time
you've been before.

158
00:11:26,292 --> 00:11:29,958
To reach it, all you have to do
is follow my voice.

159
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:32,250
It's last night.
The sun is setting.

160
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,833
You're beginning your day.

161
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,958
Oh.

162
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,750
Okay.

163
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,542
Sunken Coast?

164
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,917
She decent?

165
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,208
Like she'd care.

166
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,375
There. She put the keys
in her bag.

167
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,833
When did you next take your
keys out of your purse?

168
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,042
<i>She's still got 'em.</i>

169
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
<i>Here you go. Bye.</i>

170
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,042
Reset.

171
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,542
<i>Have you seen my earrings?</i>

172
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,417
- Which ones?
- My lucky ones. The jade?

173
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,500
We got 'em.

174
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,750
Reset.

175
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,792
Why bother?
She left the keys in the dressing room.

176
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,833
Nick, come on,
let's pull her out of the tank.

177
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,833
In a sec.

178
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,333
What the hell's
wrong with her?

179

Hey.

194
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,292
Miss Fancy left something.

195
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,417
<i>When the sun rises...</i>

196
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,708
<i>Miami turns into a ghost town.</i>

197
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,750
<i>To escape the heat of day,
the city's become nocturnal.</i>

198
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,042
<i>But sleep doesn't come easy.</i>

199
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,083
<i>We're all haunted by something.</i>

200
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,667
<i>Years ago, the battles
at the border ended...</i>

201
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,833
<i>but the battles at home
had just begun.</i>

202
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:11,375
<i>We try to go on like
nothing's changed...</i>

203
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:14,667
<i>but underneath,
the city simmers with unrest...</i>

204
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,500
<i>which means the DA's office
is never short of work.</i>

205
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,083
Walter Sylvan is gravely ill.

206
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,125
Walter Sylvan is the most
notorious land baron in Miami.

207
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:32,125
He wanted to buy the land cheap,
so he burned it to the ground.

208
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,875
Sorry I'm late.

209
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:35,333
It's all right.

210
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,875
The DA won't be needing your
services after all.

211
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,083
Isn't that right, Avery?

212
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,083
I'll contest this
at a higher court.

213
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,792
I'm sure they'll agree my client's
in no shape to get in the tank.

214
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:48,167
If you wanna depose him, you'll
have to do it the old-fashioned way.

215
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,167
You can't convict me for being
a good businessman, sweetheart.

216
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,833
No, but I could convict you
for murder.

217
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,708
There were families in that
building, Mr. Sylvan.

218
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,125
Not all of them made it
out on time.

219
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,667
I never burned
any buildings.

220
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,125
No, of course not.
Your lackeys did it for you.

221
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,750
I suppose you and your associate
will have to put me in the tank...

222
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,500
to prove that little theory.

223
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,667
But it appears that won't be happening.

224
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,375
Case is going well, then.

225
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,542
Nothing we can do.

226
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,625
The law doesn't apply to men
like Sylvan.

227
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,375
Come on, Dad. Let me take you
home to your medicine.

228
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,833
I have to get my affairs
in order.

229
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,292
Have you found her yet?

230
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,083
No, Dad. Not yet.

231
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:35,625
<i>Avery's right.</i>

232
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,542
<i>Arson, bribery, murder.</i>

233
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,792
<i>The whole city is rotten
with corruption.</i>

234
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,375
<i>Both united, one voice!
Down with the Sylvans!</i>

235
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:47,250
<i>During the war, barons like Walter
Sylvan bought up all the drylands...</i>

236
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,583
<i>for pennies on the dollar.</i>

237
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,583
<i>They profited off
the desperate</i>

238
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,375
<i>and left them to live
at the mercy of the tides.</i>

239
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:58,833
<i>The displaced carry on
the best they can.</i>

240
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,917
<i>One day, the ocean
will reclaim all of this.</i>

241
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,458
<i>Until then...</i>

242
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,833
<i>the Sunken Coast is

Thank you.

250
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,375
You have a great voice.

251
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,625
Four years I've worked here.

252
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:30,000
And you're the first man
to notice my voice.

253
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,208
Will you tell me something
I've been wondering about?

254
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:35,250
Before you performed last
night, you were crying.

255
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:36,792
Why?

256
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,167
That was my memory.

257
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,208
Shouldn't you have just seen
the things I was looking at?

258
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,750
Close your eyes.

259
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:49,542
It's a little demonstration
to answer your question.

260
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,500
So, you have a boyfriend

261
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,208
- or someone you're involved with?
- Oh.

262
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,667
- What does that...
- Answer the question.

263
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,875
Eyes closed.

264
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:05,042
No, I'm not involved right now.

265
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:09,375
Then for the purposes of this experiment,
we'll use something more elemental.

266
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:10,583
Your first kiss.

267
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,125
Picture that moment.

268
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,542
Charlie Mulvaney.

269
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,292
Okay. The way
young Charlie approached.

270
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,458
And the kiss itself.

271
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,875
Not just the beginning...

272
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,292
the whole kiss.

273
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,125
Until the moment
you break away.

274
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:39,667
And by the end, you saw yourself
as well as him, didn't you?

275
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,792
Happens with everyone.

276
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,750
Your turn to answer
my question.

277
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,542
Why were you crying?

278
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,292
Nerves.

279
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,042
Happens before every gig.

280
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,417
I step onto that stage...

281
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,833
and they don't wanna see a
woman in a thrift store dress...

282
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:02,917
wondering how she's gonna
make rent.

283
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,250
They want something perfect.

284
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,542
They want to be lied to.

285
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,667
You don't seem
like you're lying.

286
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:18,583
Well, I guess it's working.

287
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,833
Would you escort me home?

288
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:29,833
All right.

289
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,250
Don't bother. Bulb's out.

290
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,833
Would you like some water?

291
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,375
- Sure.
- Okay.

292
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:29,708
That machine of yours...

293
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:36,542
How close can you get
before the illusion's broken?

294
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,458
Can you get this close?

295
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,375
This close?

296
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,708
How about...

297
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,083
this close?

298
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:05,875
Aren't you tired of watching
from the shadows?

299
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:21,583
You're up early.

300
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:23,792
I like it this time of day.

301
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,625
Before the sun sets
and the city wakes up.

302
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,458
Tea?

303
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:32,167
I can't find my mug.

304
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,708
It's under your sink,
next to a lipstick, a stocking...

305
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:36,750
and...

306
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:38,875
your neck massager.

307
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,292
You were snooping.

308
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,167
I saw it in your reminiscence.

309
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:48,333
How come I don't remember
the mug?

310
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:52,333
People tend to notice the same things
they were focused on in the moment.

311
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,500
I mean, it's possible,
if you revisit the same memory enough

312
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:58,000
to notice new things, but...

313
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,292
if you're not careful,
you can get burned.

314
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,792
Have that moment seared in
an endless loop in your mind.

315
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:05,875
That's why you
never go in the tank?

316
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,125
Memories are like perfume.

317
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,625
Better in small doses.

318
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,458
Maybe you haven't made
the right memories.

319
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,708
Jesus Christ.
You're in here again?

320
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:40,875
No, no, no! Put me back!
Put me back!

321
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,750
For months now,
you've been hitting this tank,

322
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,708
reliving every damn memory
you had with her.

323
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,625
You have to get your head
out of the past

324
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,917
and into the here and now.

325
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,375
God damn it!

326
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,250
Oh, shit.

327
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,208
It's been months, Nick.

328
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:05,250
I can't keep turning
a blind eye to this.

329
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,875
I'm the boss, not you.

330
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,125
And I've turned a blind eye
to plenty.

331
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:12,250
Well, the difference is I know what I'm
gonna find at the bottom of a bottle.

332
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,750
And it's not answers.

333
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:16,250
We were happy.
We were planning for the future.

334
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:19,583
She wouldn't just disappear,
not without a word.

335
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:23,667
She settled up with her landlord.
She emptied her apartment.

336
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,792
She would have told me.

337
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:26,958
Why didn't she tell me?

338
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:32,750
All I know is, wherever she is,
she has moved on. And you should, too.

339
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,625
People don't just vanish.

340
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:37,375
Okay? She must be
in some kind of trouble.

341
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,583
We're the ones
in trouble, Nick.

342
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:43,375
Pods poaching our business,
regulars jumping ship.

343
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,250
Even Elsa hasn't popped by
for her usual in months.

344
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,000
I never thought I'd miss the sight of
that old man's pasty ass, but here we are.

345
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,833
Every business
has its ups and downs.

346
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,917
No, no, no. This is different.

347
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,125
We've gotten by
in the Spill-Zone for years.

348
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,083
But pretty soon that dam
is gonna break,

349
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:01,333
and we'll be underwater with
no funds to fish ourselves out.

350
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:04,208
So, what do you
expect me to do, hmm?

351
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:07,042
Avery called. She's got
a day job for us.

352
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,292
So, go home and get some sleep.

353
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:10,792
'Cause you look like shit.

354
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,625
<i>I try to forget.</i>

355
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:21,333
<i>But even without the tank,
she haunts me.</i>

356
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,667
<i>That book.</i>

357
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,917
<i>I see you reading it sometimes
when you can't sleep.</i>

358
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,625
What are those?
Are those memories?

359
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:34,500
They aren't mine.
They belong to the people I interrogated.

360
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:37,958
During the war?

361
00:28:40,417 --> 00:28:42,667
You can't find one memory
without moving through others.

362
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:46,125
I couldn't just see the things
I was asked to find.

363
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,833
I saw why they ran
in the first place.

364
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,708
When the waves came for them...

365
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,333
they had no walls
to hide behind.

366
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,417
And the people,
what happened to them?

367
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,958
The world moved on.

368
00:29:02,542 --> 00:29:04,667
Trying to pretend like
none of this happened.

369
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,375
But there are some things
we should never forget.

370
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:15,333
And some things we can't forget
even if we want to.

371
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:18,917
<i>Where did she go?</i>

372
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:21,917
<i>Why did she leave?</i>

373
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,250
<i>People don't just disappear.</i>

374
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,292
All right.

375
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:37,458
Look, man. I'll tell you the
same thing I tell you every time.

376
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,708
Mae isn't here.

377
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:45,708
If there's something you know,
please, anything.

378
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:48,292
I'm not sure Mae was the person
you thought she was.

379
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,208
<i>You're going on a journey.</i>

380
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,708
<i>A journey through memory.</i>

381
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,250
<i>Your destination?</i>

382
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,708
<i>A place and time
you've been before.</i>

383
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,292
<i>Are you awake?</i>

384
00:30:25,417 --> 00:30:26,458
<i>No.</i>

385
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,042
Then I must be dreaming, too.

386
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,250
This bruise, what happened?

387
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:40,750
Oh, occupational hazard.

388
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:44,208
You try waiting tables
in 6-inch heels.

389
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,583
Oh.

390
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,833
How did you smuggle us
into baron country anyway?

391
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,833
Called in a favor
from an old client.

392
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,375
You do this to impress
all the girls?

393
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:56,875
Only the one I'm in love with.

394
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:03,583
You don't love me. We've only
known each other a few months.

395
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:06,500
You know how many sunsets
I saw in the trenches?

396
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,500
1,458.

397
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,333
I counted them, every minute.

398
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:17,167
Sunset was the last few minutes
before the fighting began again.

399
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,125
I used to wonder how I could
spend those moments better.

400
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,167
Now I know.

401
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,708
Come with me.

402
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:45,500
There's somewhere
I wanna take you.

403
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,417
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

404
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,333
<i>A story?
What kind of story?</i>

405
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,958
One with a happy ending.

406
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,417
No such thing
as a happy ending.

407
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:10,625
All endings are sad.

408
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,083
Especially if the story
was happy.

409
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,375
Then tell me a happy story,
but end it in the middle.

410
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,667
Ever hear of Orpheus
and Eurydice?

411
00:32:28,917 --> 00:32:30,000
Jesus.

412
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,833
We're closed!

413
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,083
Shit.

414
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,708
She came back for me.
I know she did.

415
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:31,167
She could've lost that earring
months ago.

416
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,958
All kinds of shit
gets swept up in the gutter.

417
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,167
- You're late, Bannister.
- You're not gonna take me in again!

418
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,458
- Relax.
- Not again!

419
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,958
Ah, shit. Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

420
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,292
Saw a lot of runners
at the border.

421
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:54,458
There are more elegant ways of
stopping a man than a bullet.

422
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:56,000
Yeah?

423
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:59,000
I heard your partner didn't
share the same philosophy.

424
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,583
Only philosophy I had
was "don't die."

425
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,542
And I went through plenty of
bullets trying to keep it that way.

426
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,875
- Oh, they're here.
- Okay, good.

427
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,250
It's about time.

428
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,542
I haven't seen a rig like this
since the war.

429
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:18,167
Government cutbacks.

430
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,333
2D's all they spring
for now for offsites.

431
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:23,333
Meet Mr. Falks.

432
00:34:23,417 --> 00:34:25,667
Drug dealer, recently OD'd
on his own supply.

433
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,792
Rumor is, he was working for a baca
kingpin out of New Orleans named Saint Joe.

434
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:31,583
Joe is the one we're after.

435
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,667
Could be the only thing left
in there is jambalaya, but...

436
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,833
if you do find anything,
the warrant gives us a window of 10 years.

437
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:39,167
At least it saves us
on thiopental.

438
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:51,042
It's been 12 goddamn hours.
Still no sign of Joe?

439
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,417
Well, you should have invested
in a better rig.

440
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,917
It's not just that.

441
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,625
His mind's fighting my prompts
because he's dying.

442
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,542
Dying men always want closure.

443
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:04,417
Some last, happy thought
to cling to before they die.

444
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,542
I need another approach.

445
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,042
Do you enjoy
a good party, Falks?

446
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,833
Oh, here we go.

447
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,750
<i>What's up?</i>

448
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:36,750
Where is this?

449
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,333
Looks like New Orleans.

450
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,417
That's Lorenzo.
That's Joe's main muscle.

451
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,250
<i>Lorenzo, what's happenin'?</i>

452
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,583
All right.

453
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:48,917
Is that anyone?

454
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,208
<i>Keep 'em coming.</i>

455
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,542
Did you see any other
old friends?

456
00:35:57,042 --> 00:36:00,000
Holy shit, that's him.
We got him. That's Saint Joe.

457
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,000
'Sup, Joe?

458
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,875
I got a big shipment
comin' in soon.

459
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,875
Gonna need your friends on the
force to look the other way.

460
00:36:18,792 --> 00:36:20,458
That could be arranged.

461
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:21,917
He's making
some kind of deal.

462
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,458
Who's that
Joe's talking to?

463
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:25,167
Some lowlife.
Who cares?

464
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,500
<i>♪ Whispered something
In your ear ♪</i>

465
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,000

00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,625

467
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,500

<i>♪ But I said it anyway ♪</i>

00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,042

00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,750

476
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,458
Warrant doesn't cover Joe's booty
calls. We need to move on from this.

477
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,375
The girl, when did you
next see her?

478
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:44,833
Hey, Joe. This is Mae.

479
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,000
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

480
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:52,875
The pleasure, <i>shi wo de.</i>

481
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,000
Hmm.

482
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:01,917
No, no, no,
not that pastel shit. Hmm.

483
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,792
Ever tried baca?

484
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,333
They're a little strong
for my taste.

485
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:13,583
Listen, you're gonna sing
at his club, party in his pad...

486
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,417
but you're too good
for his baca?

487
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,042
Easy, Falks.

488
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:20,542
A girl like you needs
to be put in her place.

489
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,750
Let go! No, no. No!

490
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,125
<i>What the hell, Joe?</i>

491
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,125
<i>Apologize to the lady.</i>

492
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,583
Apologize to her?

493
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,417
You misapprehend your place
in the world, Falks.

494
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,250
See, a <i>niu</i> like that
is one of a kind.

495
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:43,417
Whereas men like you
are replaceable.

496
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,958
Wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on.

497
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,500
I recommend doing it outside.

498
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,083
Easier to hose down
the brain matter.

499
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,250
No. Please.

500
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,417
<i>Please! You can't do this.</i>

501
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,042
Sure, I can. Probably get
a medal for it.

502
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,750
<i>Stop, stop, stop!
Don't shoot.</i>

503
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,167
<i>See how simple it would be?</i>

504
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,042
All NOLA cops
are dirty. Focus on Joe.

505
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,500
- Just wait.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

506
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,667
<i>You all right?
You look shaken.</i>

507
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,708
- <i>It's okay?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

508
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,875
<i>You sure you don't want one?</i>

509
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,667
<i>It's good for the nerves.</i>

510
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,042
Jesus, don't.

511
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,250
What are you doing, Mae?

512
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,833
Who gives a shit
about this girl?

513
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,542
- Get back to the collusion case, Nick.
- Hang on.

514
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,125
- Tell us about Saint Joe.
- Hey. Hey.

515
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
- Look, he sent you here...
- Don't do that.

516
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:29,792
...because he's expanding his baca
business into Miami, isn't he?

517
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:36,042
- Whoa, whoa, whoa... What the hell is that?
- He's blanking.

518
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,958
You really should let the
professionals do the prompting.

519
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,125
- I just asked a question.
- A leading question.

520
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:43,000
You presupposed Joe sent Falks here
to help with a Miami expansion.

521
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,583
You were wrong. There's no
memory to access, you hit static.

522
00:39:45,667 --> 00:39:48,542
He blanks for more than a couple of
minutes and he'll get brain damage.

523
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,917
Bannister. God damn it,
just do it.

524
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,583
All right.
Come here, quick.

525
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,000
It's all right, Falks.

526
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:02,125
You took a misstep.

527
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:04,083
You just traveled
down the wrong path.

528
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:05,708
But now you're back...

529
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:08,875
back to somewhere you've been,
with someone you know.

530
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,875
The girl you sent to Joe,
when was the last time you saw her?

531
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:24,542
<i>Hey.
Sorry to bother you.</i>

532
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,917
<i>I'm just here to pick up
the weekly drop.</i>

533
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:31,875
<i>Had to go anyway,
baby. Be good, huh?</i>

534
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,125
Mm-hmm.

535
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:36,875
Joe's leaving. Move on, Nick.

536
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:38,875
<i>Have a seat, Falks.</i>

537
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,500
<i>I really shouldn't.</i>

538
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:42,542
<i>Joe won't mind.</i>

539
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:44,708
Do you remember
the first time we met?

540
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,375
<i>I was broke. Alone.</i>

541
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,500
<i>I thought I had nothing
left to lose.</i>

542
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,875
<i>But I was wrong. I still had...</i>

543
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:57,083
a shred of innocence,
a glimmer of hope.

544
00:40:59,708 --> 00:41:02,125
And then I...

545
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,250
<i>I tried baca. And it took
everything away.</i>

546
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,375
The innocence, the hope.

547
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:12,083
<i>But also the fear, the hurt...</i>

548
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,583
<i>the guilt.</i>

549
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:18,292
<i>I became invincible...</i>

550
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,667
<i>because nothing mattered.</i>

551
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:27,375
<i>Nothing but these</i>
<i>little pearls.</i>

552
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,750
<i>I should go.</i>

553
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,833
Joe's expecting his baca drop.

554
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:33,542
What the hell?

555
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,833
You stealing from Joe?

556
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:40,417
Why?

557
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,833
Because I have nothing
left to lose.

558
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:45,417
Get your head
in the game, Nick.

559
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,917
You're growing gills
in the tank for that junkie?

560
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,292
She's not a junkie. She's not.

561
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:53,292
Oh, shit. You didn't even know.

562
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:57,208
- She never touched baca. Ever. Right?
- God damn it.

563
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:02,625
You knew and you never said?

564
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,792
Wasn't my place.

565
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:10,125
Baca is a drug that
you don't kick. Ever.

566
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:12,167
She'll keep going back to it
and to whoever she gets it from.

567
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,667
Then I know where to find her.

568
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:18,833
Nick!

569
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:34,500
<i>Who was she?</i>

570
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,583
<i>Who was she when not with me?</i>

571
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:45,750
<i>Was she the woman I knew?</i>

572
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,000
<i>Or that stranger I saw?</i>

573
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,792
<i>Was she running
from the past...</i>

574
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:01,333
<i>or racing back towards it?</i>

575
00:43:01,417 --> 00:43:04,375
<i>To find where she'd gone,
I had to know where she'd been.</i>

576
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,292
<i>I had to look back...</i>

577
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:09,542
<i>to New Orleans.</i>

578
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,875
The hell do you want?

579
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:33,417
I'm looking for Saint Joe.
Lorenzo referred me.

580
00:43:35,417 --> 00:43:36,875
Friend of Lorenzo's.

581
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:46,625
He said he's a friend
of Lorenzo's.

582
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,167
Friends with Lorenzo, eh?

583
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,208
You got <i>guanxi</i> with me, pal?

584
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:05,583
Business transaction.

585
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,583
I'd rather discuss it
in private.

586
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,708
Vet, huh?

587
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,208
You folks even starch
your sentences.

588
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,292
What brand of henchman
were you?

589
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,750
I was in the navy. Then I was
drafted for border patrol.

590
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:24,333
Drafted. Huh.
I know how that goes.

591
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,708
Government forced your hand.

592
00:44:27,792 --> 00:44:29,583
Forced mine, too,

593
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,708
only God-fearing citizens like me
weren't drafted for border patrol.

594
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,625
We were rounded up
and put in little camps.

595
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:37,542
You were interned.

596
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:40,542
Right here in Louisiana.
9th Ward.

597
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,750
Were you there
when the levees broke?

598
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,583
How do you think
I got this name?

599
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:49,125
Sure as hell ain't
my sense of piety.

600
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,750
<i>"Jiu"</i> means "ninth."

601
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:54,125
"Saint" 'cause they figure
my ass walks on water.

602
00:44:55,708 --> 00:44:58,625
But that's all blood
under the bridge now, <i>pengyou.</i>

603
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,958
And this is business, right?

604
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:04,625
Right. I need vermillion baca,
10 pallets.

605
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,458
Bulk, eh?

606
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:10,625
You got balls. Bocce-sized.

607
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,583
Fine. Let's discuss payment.

608
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:18,542
Alas, payment is not the <i>wenti</i>
holding up this transaction, <i>pengyou.</i>

609
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,625
It's trust.

610
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:25,833
For instance,
your pal Lorenzo's been dead for years.

611
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:27,833
Work-related injury.

612
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:32,958
Which means you're not
who you say you are. Are you?

613
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,542
Right.

614
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:49,875
People say it's peaceful
to drown...

615
00:45:49,958 --> 00:45:52,042
but that's <i>gou pi.</i>

616
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:56,250
I learned that in the camps when your kind
left us to die after the levees burst.

617
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,042
Here, I'll show you.

618
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:14,250
Now, <i>gao su wo,</i>
why are you really here?

619
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:15,708
I'm looking for a woman.

620
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:20,375
Some <i>niu</i> ran out on you?

621
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,208
I guess your balls
ain't so bocce-sized after all.

622
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:24,750
She stole your baca.

623
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:26,000
Goes by the name Mae.

624
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:28,708
Hmm.

625
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:31,792
You've seen
my favorite chanteuse.

626
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,583
So, you come to my <i>jia</i>
thinking she boomeranged back?

627
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,375
Sorry, <i>pengyou.</i>

628
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:44,750
I haven't seen Mae since
she skipped out years ago.

629
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:49,917
Don't feel bad. She fooled me
just like she fooled you.

630
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,125
Hey, I know exactly
what she took from me.

631
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,542
Drugs, money, time.

632
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:58,833
But what did she take from you?

633
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:01,750
Hmm?

634
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,708
Oh, poor <i>guisunzi.</i>

635
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:10,042
You've been had,
and you don't even know why.

636
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:16,250
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry, <i>pengyou.</i>

637
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,375
The pain will be over soon.

638
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:20,917
But not too soon.

639
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:54,042
Watts?

640
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,417
Let go and I'll
shoot you myself.

641
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,875
My tank.

642
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:32,958
Shit, I'm out.

643
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,833
Good thinking,
shooting the tank.

644
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,375
I was aiming for Joe.

645
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,792
I've seen this kind
of hit before.

646
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,958
Your lungs will fill with blood.
You'll suffocate before you bleed out.

647
00:50:34,875 --> 00:50:36,750
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

648
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:40,500
Don't let me die...

649
00:50:41,542 --> 00:50:43,167
like they did in the camps.

650
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,208
We'll part as friends, then.

651
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:09,917
Why do you put yourself
through this, Nick?

652
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,792
<i>Mae.
What was she hiding?</i>

653
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:23,333
You still have me in there?

654
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,958
Locked away with all those
other memories?

655
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:27,708
You and your lost keys.

656
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:31,042
Ever think the best thing
would be to destroy them?

657
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:34,792
Why would I do that?

658
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:37,167
Maybe memory fades
for a reason.

659
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,458
If we just dwelled on the bad things
in the past, we'd never get over them.

660
00:51:41,542 --> 00:51:44,750
And if we just dwelled
on the good...

661
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:46,458
we might never match it again.

662
00:51:46,542 --> 00:51:48,833
There aren't any memories
you wanna hold on to?

663
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:52,000
- I guess there's one.
- Hmm?

664
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,542
When London sank,
I fled to New Orleans.

665
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:57,417
But New Orleans had a lot of...

666
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:00,833
bad associations.

667
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:04,875
So, I got a one-way ticket
out of there to here.

668
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:08,000
When I arrived in Miami,
I had no plan whatsoever.

669
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,083
I had no savings,
I had no place to stay.

670
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:14,375
So, I found a dinghy in a canal
and crawled in it for a nap.

671
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:18,667
And while I was sleeping,
some asshole cuts me loose.

672
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,917
<i>I drifted south past the Keys
and would have drifted forever...</i>

673
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,583
if I hadn't found Frances.

674
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:26,958
Frances?

675
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,750
<i>At first, I thought
it was a mirage.</i>

676
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,500
She was smoking a cigarette
on the stoop

677
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,000
of a white clapboard house...

678
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,958
<i>in the middle of the waves.</i>

679
00:52:34,042 --> 00:52:37,333
<i>It was like something
out of a dream.</i>

680
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:41,833
And she took me in
and got me on my feet again.

681
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:48,750
So, when I'm feeling scared
or lost...

682
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:50,792
then that is
what I think about.

683
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,292
I think of a song.

684
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:59,833
- My grandfather used to hum it.
- Oh.

685
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:03,375
After he died, didn't hear
that song for a long time.

686
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,917
And then I heard it again.

687
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,542
You sang it so sweetly,
it was like I'd never...

688
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,292
never truly heard it before.

689
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:23,750
<i>♪ You are smiling
You were smiling then ♪</i>

690
00:53:25,583 --> 00:53:28,583
<i>♪ Can't remember where ♪</i>

691
00:53:29,542 --> 00:53:31,500
<i>♪ Or when ♪</i>

692
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,792
What are you even
looking for in there?

693
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,333
What she took from me.

694
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,542
She was a grifter, playing me,
looking for something.

695
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:50,833
No offense, Nick,
but what would she want to take from you?

696
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:53,042
The only thing of value I have
doesn't belong to me.

697
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:57,250
Right. Some bullshit memories.
You're reaching.

698
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,917
Come on, think. You were here with
her the last time she was here.

699
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,042
Of course I was.

700
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,625
Were you with her
the whole time?

701
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:11,542
Oh. Nick's not around
for another hour.

702
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:15,583
No, I brought these for him,
but this is for you.

703
00:54:16,792 --> 00:54:18,583
I was hoping
we could talk a bit.

704
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,125
You don't like me, do you?

705
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,042
Why?

706
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,250
Nick's good at seeing people
in the tank.

707
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,708
My eyes are clearer out here.

708
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,667
You're hiding something.

709
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm an addict.

710
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:02,500
I was.

711
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,750
In New Orleans,
I got hooked on baca.

712
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,000
And you haven't told Nick.

713
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,708
He wouldn't judge you.

714
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:15,958
He wouldn't look at me
the same way, either.

715
00:55:17,042 --> 00:55:18,625
Why are you telling me?

716
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,917
Because you will judge me.

717
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:26,583
But it won't change
the way you see me.

718
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,292
I'm not one to judge.

719
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,292
You know how I got my name?

720
00:55:34,375 --> 00:55:37,833
"Watts"? Figured it was
from the...

721
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,292
During the war...

722
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:43,292
after my stint on the front,
I worked in munitions.

723
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:47,667
Soldering lithium batteries
into drones. It was a shit job.

724
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,583
But I needed money
for me and my daughter.

725
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,542
You have a child?

726
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,542
She's grown now.

727
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:57,917
We're not in touch.
I'm not exactly the maternal type.

728
00:55:59,208 --> 00:56:00,958
Though...

729
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:02,458
I tried for a while.

730
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,625
Even gave up drinking.

731
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:09,708
The problem with going dry
is the mind is clear.

732
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:11,542
But the hands...

733
00:56:13,167 --> 00:56:14,958
they shake.

734
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:17,292
All it took
was one wrong spark.

735
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:20,208
Lit up that whole place
like Independence Day.

736
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,833
Afterward, my daughter
went north...

737
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:25,333
- to stay with some relations...
- Sorry.

738
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:26,958
...and I went back
to the bottle.

739
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:33,125
Only thing stopped me
drowning in it was Nick.

740
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:35,542
That's why you stayed
all these years.

741
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,208
Loyalty.

742
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:40,875
That, and he doesn't pay me
enough to drink myself to death.

743
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,542
Men are strange, aren't they?

744
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:48,125
They don't see
what's right in front of them.

745
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:49,708
There's nothing to see.

746
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,417
We both know that's not true.

747
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,333
Excuse me for a sec.

748
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,375
It's okay.
I was gonna go anyway.

749
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,292
Whatever you saw in there...

750
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,708
please don't
jump to conclusions, Nick.

751
00:57:22,792 --> 00:57:24,500
What am I supposed to think?

752
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,542
I mean, this whole time,
you've been keeping this from me?

753
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:31,208
It's complicated.

754
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,708
I didn't wanna ruin things
between us.

755
00:57:35,792 --> 00:57:37,542
You were supposed to
watch over this place.

756
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:41,417
Instead, you got drunk,
you let her walk into the vault.

757
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,500
- What are you talking about?
- Look.

758
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,708
No, no, it's impossible.

759
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:54,583
Even with the keys...

760
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,542
she wouldn't have known
the code to the vault.

761
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,583
- Even I don't know the code to the vault.
- It's not a code...

762
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:00,167
it's a tune.

763
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,792
She studied me for months.
She must have figured it out.

764
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:21,625
Everything in my batch
is here.

765
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:23,208
Wait a minute, look.

766
00:58:23,292 --> 00:58:25,292
Look at this.
Cameron, Campbell, Caplan, Cummings.

767
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,958
- What is it?
- There's no Carine.

768
00:58:27,042 --> 00:58:28,417
Elsa Carine's files.

769
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,292
<i>They're all gone.</i>

770
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:33,708
What would Mae want with Elsa?
She barely had enough to pay us.

771
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,125
To the floating market
at the park.

772
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:57,125
Sir, I'm looking
for this woman.

773
00:58:57,208 --> 00:59:00,500
- Sir, have you seen this woman? Elsa?
- No.

774
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,958
- Sir, have you seen this woman?
- No.

775
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:05,708
Hey, uh, I'm looking for Elsa
Carine, I think she works here.

776
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,792
Just wanna have a word.

777
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,292
Yeah. Talk to that rat
over there.

778
00:59:11,708 --> 00:59:13,208
Thank you. Hey.

779
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,083
Hey, hey!

780
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Hey!

781
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:29,917
Just wanna talk to you.

782
00:59:40,542 --> 00:59:41,625
Just wanna talk.

783
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,500
- Hey!
- I've got papers, pig!

784
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
Hey, I'm not a cop, okay?

785
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,250
I'm a friend of Elsa's and I want to help.
I think she's in trouble.

786
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,500
How the hell are you supposed
to help her now?

787
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:54,833
She's dead.

788
00:59:57,042 --> 00:59:58,250
Dead?

789
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:00,792
What happened?

790
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,292
Told the cops.

791
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:04,000
But they don't care
what happens to people like us.

792
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,458
What did you see?

793
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:07,042
Elsa was packing up
for the day...

794
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,542
<i>when some guy decides to get
in her face.</i>

795
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:12,083
<i>All I know is
Elsa didn't stand a chance.</i>

796
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,708
He killed her.

797
01:00:14,792 --> 01:00:16,833
I haven't seen
Freddie since.

798
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,208
Freddie?

799
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:20,500
Elsa's kid?

800
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,958
<i>Elsa had a child.</i>

801
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:25,917
Did the man hurt Freddie, too?

802
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,792
He left that to his girlfriend.

803
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:30,792
Some redheaded bitch.
She grabbed him.

804
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:33,292
Wouldn't let him go
no matter how much he screamed.

805
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,667
<i>Who was she?</i>

806
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,250
<i>Who was she when not with me?</i>

807
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:46,708
<i>A liar.</i>

808
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,500
<i>An addict.</i>

809
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:51,792
<i>A killer.</i>

810
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,083
<i>I had to find her.</i>

811
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:59,125
<i>But it turns out,
she was already looking for me.</i>

812
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,917
Mae?

813
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,583
Forget about Mae.

814
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,167
She's moved on.

815
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,167
And I suggest you do the same.

816
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,583
It's me.

817
01:01:41,667 --> 01:01:44,083
Loverboy won't be
bothering us no more.

818
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,833
- Again.
- No.

819
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:55,167
You wanna get burned?

820
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,875
Have this beatdown
in your brain forever?

821
01:01:57,958 --> 01:02:00,958
- You're gonna have to let this go.
- No.

822
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:03,375
He must have left some clue of who he is.
I just need to remember.

823
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:04,833
- Nick!
- What are you doing?

824
01:02:04,917 --> 01:02:06,917
I am saving your junkie ass.

825
01:02:08,917 --> 01:02:10,667
Okay.

826
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,958
I was hoping you'd drop this,
but I can't let you burn yourself.

827
01:02:13,042 --> 01:02:15,708
I found something
in your peripheral vision.

828
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:18,208
Anything about this face
strike you as familiar?

829
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,625
- He's the dirty cop who worked for Saint Joe.
- Yeah.

830
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,042
Let's go see what we can
find out from Avery.

831
01:02:35,917 --> 01:02:37,542
Break up the barons!

832
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,583
Murderers!

833
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:41,083
Town's ready to riot.

834
01:02:41,167 --> 01:02:42,250
What happened?

835
01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:43,875
Man, you're
in the tank so much,

836
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,500
you don't even know?

837
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,375
The land baron,
Walter Sylvan...

838
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:51,042
the guy you were supposed to depose,
he died a couple of days ago.

839
01:02:51,125 --> 01:02:53,875
These folks were hoping the
courts would bust his monopoly.

840
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:58,750
But his widow and son
will inherit everything.

841
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:01,417
It's late.
Someone might see us.

842
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,458
Come on, Mom.
You're just confused.

843
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,042
Do they think
this is a mistake?

844
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,708
Old fling of yours, Nick?

845
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:15,750
Yeah, we met a long time ago,
back when I first opened shop.

846
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,667
She came to me for a session.

847
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,375
<i>Seeing Tamara
stirred a memory.</i>

848
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,875
<i>A clue that had been
in my mind all along.</i>

849
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:35,708
I thought I told you
not to get back in the tank.

850
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:39,250
Well, Mae stole all of Elsa's
files, but there was another copy.

851
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:40,542
What did you find?

852
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:43,083
Well, I talked to Avery.

853
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:46,333
She's still pretty pissed about
you blowing her deposition.

854
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:48,125
But she did give me some intel.

855
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,375
His name is Cyrus Boothe.

856
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,000
Cyrus Boothe.

857
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:55,292
He used to work for Saint Joe,
but they had a falling out.

858
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:56,958
So, he moved to Miami.

859
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,625
And until recently,
he's been working for...

860
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:02,125
- Walter Sylvan.
- Yeah.

861
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:04,625
See, look at this. Listen.

862
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:08,333
<i>Don't worry, my flower.
I love you.</i>

863
01:04:09,792 --> 01:04:11,792
<i>I'll always take care of you.</i>

864
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,500
I mean, that voice
always bothered me.

865
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,958
I just couldn't put my finger
on it.

866
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:17,125
And then I remembered
where I'd heard it.

867
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,458
Tamara Sylvan's reminiscence.

868
01:04:19,542 --> 01:04:20,708
Walter's widow.

869
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:22,292
It was years ago.

870
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:24,083
I never forgot that voice.

871
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:27,000
- <i>Did anyone see you?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

872
01:04:27,083 --> 01:04:30,417
<i>Thank God.
Everyone's mad enough as it is.</i>

873
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,042
<i>They think this is a mistake.</i>

874
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:33,458
Listen.

875
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:36,875
<i>Don't worry, my flower.
I love you.</i>

876
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:38,833
<i>I'll always take care of you.</i>

877
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:46,625
They say you can't tell yet,
but I know it's a boy.

878
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,958
Are you happy?
Tell me you're happy.

879
01:04:53,042 --> 01:04:55,625
I'm so happy I could dance.

880
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,625
There's no music.

881
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:01,042
Remember the song that
was playing the first night we met?

882
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,667
On the count of three,
I want you to imagine it.

883
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,083
<i>Can you hear it?</i>

884
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,583
<i>I hear it, Walter.</i>

885
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:08,292
Elsa's lover
was Walter Sylvan...

886
01:05:08,375 --> 01:05:09,333
<i>I hear it.</i>

887
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:10,500
...and they had a son.

888
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,375
And Walter wanted him dead.

889
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:16,000
He knew he was dying. He sent Boothe
to tie up the loose ends with Mae.

890
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:18,917
We can't prove it.
Not with this.

891
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,625
The only files on Elsa are in your memory.
That's hearsay.

892
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:25,042
Avery can't use it, but I can.

893
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,458
If I find Boothe,
I'll find Mae.

894
01:05:27,542 --> 01:05:28,583
Nick, wait.

895
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:34,625
In all the time that you knew Mae,
how much did you really know her?

896
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,542
How much did you
really love her?

897
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:39,125
- Why the hell do you care?
- Because I know how blind you can be.

898
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:42,792
You're hurt because
you thought you were in love.

899
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,208
But it wasn't real.

900
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:46,167
She was an idea
wrapped in a tight dress.

901
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,167
An absence you wanted to pour
all your broken pieces into.

902
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:51,750
You think I'm chasing an absence?
Well, at least I'm chasing something.

903
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,958
I'm not just running away
all the time.

904
01:05:54,042 --> 01:05:55,292
What's that supposed to mean?

905
01:05:55,375 --> 01:05:58,000
You ran away
from your own daughter.

906
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:00,208
You can be a real son of a
bitch, you know that?

907
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:01,958
But it's true, isn't it?

908
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:05,375
Everything you cared about,
your ex, your kid, your job...

909
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:06,958
you left.

910
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,083
I never left you.

911
01:06:09,167 --> 01:06:11,125
Well, maybe you should have.

912
01:06:11,208 --> 01:06:13,125
'Cause I'm no better than the bottle
for you. I'm just another place to hide.

913
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:14,750
You'd be better off
working a pod.

914
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:15,958
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

915
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:17,250
- No.
- Watts.

916
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:20,333
What you have with me
isn't a life.

917
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,750
It's barely a living.

918
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,583
Maybe it's best
if you moved on.

919
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:26,667
You're firing me?

920
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,208
I'll call one of the pods
on your behalf.

921
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:29,750
I'll set you up
with a good gig.

922
01:06:29,833 --> 01:06:32,917
Screw you and your charity.
This isn't about me.

923
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,583
This is about you
and your goddamn obsession.

924
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:38,250
She is responsible for the
murder of an innocent woman

925
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,708
and the kidnapping
of a little boy.

926
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,500
And she used my files
to do it.

927
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:43,125
Then go to the police.

928
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:44,917
We both know the police don't
care about cases like this.

929
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:48,375
I'm asking you.

930
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,875
I am begging you.

931
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:52,583
Don't go down this path.

932
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:56,167
Stay here in this life.

933
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,833
Stay here with me.

934
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,292
I'm sorry, Watts.

935
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:07,958
I have to do this.

936
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,875
Fine.

937
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:18,000
You made your choice.

938
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:20,042
I just hope to hell
that you survive it.

939
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,292
'Cause I won't be around
to save your ass the next time.

940
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:45,417
<i>For your safety,
please stand behind the yellow line.</i>

941
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:56,583
<i>The Sylvans, like all other
barons, live in the drylands.</i>

942
01:07:57,958 --> 01:08:00,292
<i>They build dams
to insulate themselves...</i>

943
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:04,333
<i>pushing the waves
into the surrounding areas.</i>

944
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:10,125
<i>The barons stay afloat
by drowning everyone else.</i>

945
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:14,583
<i>They say the only ones to survive the
Titanic were the rich and the rats.</i>

946
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,292
<i>The barons are both.</i>

947
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,125
I'd like a word with
Ms. Sylvan regarding the...

948
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,542
I know exactly
what it's regarding.

949
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,000
And you're an hour late.

950
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:30,625
Little tall, aren't you?

951
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:09,292
Try to stick to the script,
and fix the tie.

952
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:38,958
Did anyone see you?

953
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:41,625
Oh, thank God.

954
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:44,167
Everyone's mad enough as it is.

955
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,292
They think this is a mistake.

956
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,208
<i>Most burners are torn apart
by the worlds they straddle...</i>

957
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:55,542
<i>the real one around them</i>

958
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:58,750
<i>and the one
playing in their mind.</i>

959
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:02,292
<i>Only the rich mold the world
to meet their delusions.</i>

960
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:05,000
Do you remember me?

961
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:07,125
We met once.
I'm Nick Bannister.

962
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,000
Walter, please.

963
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,708
They say
you can't tell yet...

964
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,792
but I know it's a boy.

965
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:24,042
Your boy's grown now.

966
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,667
We need to talk
about Cyrus Boothe.

967
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:29,500
Boothe works security
for you, right?

968
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,333
Where is he? Tell me.

969
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,875
I hear it, Walter.

970
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:37,958
I hear it.

971
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:39,792
All right, I'm done playing.
Your husband is dead. Come here.

972
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,208
Nonsense.

973
01:10:41,292 --> 01:10:43,542
Walter and I are expecting
our baby any day now.

974
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,042
When are we?

975
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,208
It's been years, Tamara.

976
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,083
When did I change?

977
01:10:57,167 --> 01:10:59,625
You ever hear of a girl
named Elsa Carine?

978
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:02,375
She and Walter
were having an affair.

979
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,875
One of many flowers.

980
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:07,208
Only this one was different.
She had a child.

981
01:11:07,292 --> 01:11:09,250
Walter never liked sharing.

982
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,000
That's why he told Boothe.

983
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:13,375
Told him what?

984
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:16,292
To kill them. Both of them.

985
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:17,708
You heard him say that?

986
01:11:17,792 --> 01:11:20,917
He's not the man
I thought he'd be.

987
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,292
When you're young,
you think the future will be one thing.

988
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:30,042
You see it play out
like a string of dominoes.

989
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:32,708
You have no idea...

990
01:11:32,792 --> 01:11:34,542
the things that are lined up.

991
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,083
Boothe...

992
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,708
was he working with anyone?

993
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,000
There was a woman.

994
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,333
Some whore from New Orleans.

995
01:11:46,042 --> 01:11:47,375
Where are they now?

996
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
Tamara, where are
Boothe and Mae?

997
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:54,292
Where do you think?

998
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:56,458
With all the other trash
you can't throw away.

999
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:00,417
You're the man
from the deposition.

1000
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:02,292
Security!

1001
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:03,375
I just have
a couple of questions.

1002
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,458
He's harassing my mother!

1003
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:05,667
I'm not. I'm not harassing her.

1004
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:06,667
- It's all right. Hey.
- Come on.

1005
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,125
I know you.

1006
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:11,083
You're the man who remembers
everyone else's memories.

1007
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:13,208
What do you want us
to do with him, ma'am?

1008
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,875
Exactly what Walter
would have done with him.

1009
01:12:25,125 --> 01:12:26,375
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait!

1010
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:27,458
You're so happy.

1011
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:28,417
Tamara!

1012
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,833
You're so happy...

1013
01:12:33,875 --> 01:12:34,958
Hey!

1014
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:37,083
Sorry, buddy.
I'll make it fast.

1015
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:44,958
You served?

1016
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Two tours on the Gulf.

1017
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:50,583
Three tours. Western line.

1018
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,250
Next time, I won't miss.

1019
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,125
I wanna buy your boat.

1020
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:29,792
<i>I didn't get much from the
Sylvan widow, but it was enough.</i>

1021
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,500
<i>There's only one place
where the trash piles up...</i>

1022
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:35,208
<i>alongside all the city's
lost souls.</i>

1023
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:39,417
<i>The old recycling plants.</i>

1024
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,583
<i>To find Boothe and Mae,
I had to go to Hell itself.</i>

1025
01:14:41,292 --> 01:14:43,417
Say it.

1026
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,750
Say "People like us don't fall in love.
We plummet."

1027
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:50,167
Then touch me here.

1028
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,500
Don't move.

1029
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:03,750
Hello, Mae.

1030
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,292
Get out of here.

1031
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:13,583
Go.

1032
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,583
Tenacious fella, ain't you?

1033
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:29,917
Tell me where I can find her.

1034
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,792
I bet you thought
that was fate, huh?

1035
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:49,333
- What?
- Some kind of sign...

1036
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:52,667
that she should sing that song
from when you was a kid.

1037
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:55,625
But nothing's an accident
with Mae.

1038
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:57,833
Everything's researched...

1039
01:15:57,917 --> 01:16:00,250
meticulously calculated.

1040
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,417
You can hate her for it.

1041
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,333
But who are you to judge?

1042
01:16:06,417 --> 01:16:09,042
Mae and me,
we're from a different world.

1043
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:10,625
The one that sank.

1044
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,667
When the waves came,
they washed away our lies.

1045
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:21,500
Revealed what this world
has always been.

1046
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:24,250
A wilderness with one rule.

1047
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:29,000
Survive or die.

1048
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:33,917
A place like that
is beyond good and evil.

1049
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:38,333
Only sin left
is self-deception.

1050
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:41,458
Telling yourself that you're
better than everyone else.

1051
01:16:41,542 --> 01:16:44,542
That you deserve
to be standing...

1052
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:47,125
while everyone else sinks.

1053
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:51,375
I've never labored
under that delusion.

1054
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:53,500
Always seen myself...

1055
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,875
exactly for what I am.

1056
01:16:57,542 --> 01:16:59,167
And I see you, too.

1057
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:01,875
Where is she?

1058
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:05,208
You think
you're some avenging hero.

1059
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:07,833
Where is she?

1060
01:17:07,917 --> 01:17:12,333
You're just an empty man
looking for a woman to blame.

1061
01:17:14,125 --> 01:17:15,958
Come on, shoot me.

1062
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:17,625
You won't get
what's in my head.

1063
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,583
You'll never get to Mae.

1064
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:10,417
Shit.

1065
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:10,708
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

1066
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:17,292
<i>A story?
What kind of story?</i>

1067
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,292
<i>One with a happy ending.</i>

1068
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:29,083
<i>No such thing
as a happy ending.</i>

1069
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,833
<i>All endings are sad.
Especially if the story was happy.</i>

1070
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:37,208
<i>Then tell me a happy story...</i>

1071
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:38,958
<i>but end it in the middle.</i>

1072
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,625
People love their secrets.

1073
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:54,000
They think secrets are the one thing
they can take with them when they go...

1074
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,292
but not you, Boothe.

1075
01:23:55,375 --> 01:23:57,958
You don't get to
keep your secrets or hers.

1076
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,375
You think you want answers...

1077
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:05,458
but you don't.

1078
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,458
You're blind with rage.

1079
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:11,833
And there's safety in that.

1080
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:14,542
Your ignorance protects you.

1081
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:18,250
'Cause when you finally see
Mae for who she really is...

1082
01:24:18,917 --> 01:24:20,542
the truth...

1083
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:22,917
ain't gonna set you free.

1084
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,333
It's gonna damn you.

1085
01:24:26,292 --> 01:24:27,583
Like me.

1086
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:39,792
You're going on a journey.

1087
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:41,625
Your destination?

1088
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,167
A place and time
you've been before.

1089
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:46,833
You were sent to Miami
to find Mae.

1090
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:48,667
Show me when you found her.

1091
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,417
Stay away, asshole.

1092
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,583
Is that any way
to treat an old pal?

1093
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:07,875
I don't know you, "pal."

1094
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,708
But I know you.

1095
01:25:09,792 --> 01:25:11,583
You're Saint Joe's old <i>niu.</i>

1096
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,833
Don't know who that is.

1097
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:16,458
Joe's still
got a hard-on for you.

1098
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:18,917
Especially when you took off
with all of his baca.

1099
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:23,000
You're the dirty cop
he used to run with.

1100
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:25,042
He sent you
to bring me back?

1101
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:26,542
He did.

1102
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:28,958
But I'm an independent
contractor now.

1103
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:34,000
Those scars a courtesy of Joe?

1104
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:36,333
Guess I'm not the only one
who stole from him, then.

1105
01:25:36,417 --> 01:25:39,792
I'm gonna look like the goddamn Mona Lisa
compared to what he's gonna do with you...

1106
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:41,667
if I hand you over.

1107
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,083
- Baca's gone. I sold it a long time ago.
- I'm not here for that.

1108
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:46,292
<i>I got a new proposition.</i>

1109
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:48,583
Unless you want Joe
paying you a visit...

1110
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:50,625
I suggest you cooperate.

1111
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:53,000
What do you want me to do?

1112
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,583
I want you...

1113
01:25:54,667 --> 01:25:55,958
to do what you do best...

1114
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,125
to this guy.

1115
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,458
It was all a setup.

1116
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:06,792
<i>Tell me about your friend
from the war again.</i>

1117
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:07,792
<i>Nick.</i>

1118
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,458
Baca?

1119
01:26:10,542 --> 01:26:11,792
What do you
want to know?

1120
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:14,875
Hank? Oh, shit.

1121
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:17,167
<i>Anything that
comes to mind, really.</i>

1122
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:21,458
Kind of women he likes,
kind of music he listens to...

1123
01:26:21,542 --> 01:26:24,792
There's this song he used
to whistle in the trenches.

1124
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:36,083
<i>♪ And so it seems... ♪</i>

1125
01:26:36,167 --> 01:26:37,292
<i>She planned everything.</i>

1126
01:26:37,375 --> 01:26:39,208
<i>♪ ...that we've met... ♪</i>

1127
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:40,292
The song.

1128
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:42,958
<i>♪ ...before ♪</i>

1129
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:43,958
<i>The earring.</i>

1130
01:26:46,292 --> 01:26:48,417
Oh, my God,
even the lost keys were a setup.

1131
01:26:49,625 --> 01:26:50,833
<i>Do it again!</i>

1132
01:26:51,875 --> 01:26:52,958
<i>You drop the keys!</i>

1133
01:26:57,375 --> 01:26:59,208
You're gonna do it again.

1134
01:26:59,292 --> 01:27:02,625
This whole time,
I was nothing but a mark.

1135
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:04,500
<i>It has been
three months.</i>

1136
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,208
<i>These things take time, okay?
His partner's got the key.</i>

1137
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:07,750
<i>I can't figure out
his combination.</i>

1138
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,875
Liar! You're stalling!

1139
01:27:12,542 --> 01:27:13,458
Why?

1140
01:27:15,792 --> 01:27:17,792
Ugh!

1141
01:27:17,875 --> 01:27:21,875
Don't tell me this gimp
screwed a conscience into you?

1142
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,750
<i>I'm touched.</i>

1143
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,333
<i>But remember,
in this line of work,</i>

1144
01:27:26,417 --> 01:27:28,250
<i>a conscience
will get you killed.</i>

1145
01:27:29,667 --> 01:27:31,125
This bruise,
what happened?

1146
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,833
I want those files.

1147
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:38,917
Show me.

1148
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:41,333
<i>Here they are.</i>

1149
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:49,208
The guy she's with,
he's that baron, isn't he?

1150
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:50,750
What are you gonna
do with them?

1151
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:54,792
I'm gonna destroy them.

1152
01:27:54,875 --> 01:27:57,250
And all other proof
of their little tryst.

1153
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,208
What other proof?

1154
01:28:00,292 --> 01:28:04,042
No one ever told you about
the birds and the bees, Mae?

1155
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:07,542
The rich, they really don't
like it when a bastard branch

1156
01:28:07,625 --> 01:28:10,042
sprouts off of their
precious family tree.

1157
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:19,458
The boy,
what happened to him?

1158
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:25,958
<i>Hello, Elsa.</i>

1159
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,542
Oh! Sorry,
do I know you?

1160
01:28:30,625 --> 01:28:32,875
We have
mutual friends.

1161
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:37,583
How's Freddie?
Is he here today?

1162
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:40,458
Uh... what... what
do you want with Freddie?

1163
01:28:43,417 --> 01:28:45,167
Oh, hey.
Hey, Freddie.

1164
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,375
Can, can you tell me
what this is about?

1165
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:51,417
You screwed
the wrong guy.

1166
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,750
No. No.

1167
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,083
He loved me.

1168
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:01,667
Said he'd take care of me.

1169
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,125
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:04,833
He's gonna take care of both of you.

1171
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,333
I did you first.
Be grateful for that.

1172
01:29:11,667 --> 01:29:13,083
Mom?

1173
01:29:13,167 --> 01:29:14,458
Hey, Freddie.

1174
01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:16,000
<i>Can you help me, please?</i>

1175
01:29:16,083 --> 01:29:17,375
- Mommy?
- Come on.

1176
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,250
- Stop! Freddie, don't!
- Don't be afraid.

1177
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:21,042
- Come here, kid. Come on.
- No, don't!

1178
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:22,583
- No, I want my mommy!
- Don't! No!

1179
01:29:22,667 --> 01:29:24,292
<i>The hell are you doing?</i>

1180
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:25,917
What I should have
from the start.

1181
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,208
Go! Go ahead!

1182
01:29:27,292 --> 01:29:28,333
<i>Go to the boat!</i>

1183
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:30,208
Get in!

1184
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:31,875
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1185
01:29:34,167 --> 01:29:35,792
- Mommy!
- Get down!

1186
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,958
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Mommy...

1187
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:55,792
She saved him.

1188
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,917
She got away from you,
you son of a bitch.

1189
01:30:09,417 --> 01:30:12,125
It's all right. It's all right.
You took a misstep.

1190
01:30:12,208 --> 01:30:14,375
I led you down
a path never taken.

1191
01:30:18,125 --> 01:30:19,292
Let's try again.

1192
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:25,208
Oh, my God, you did see Mae
again, didn't you?

1193
01:30:35,792 --> 01:30:36,958
Oh, my God.

1194
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:40,792
We're closed!

1195
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,250
I figured you'd come back.

1196
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:44,542
What was the plan, huh?
Run away together?

1197
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:47,042
Play mom and dad
to the little boy?

1198
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:48,958
<i>Guess I'm gonna have to take
both of you out now.</i>

1199
01:30:49,042 --> 01:30:51,667
- <i>No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait.</i>
- <i>Let's get lover boy out here.</i>

1200
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,917
Nick doesn't know anything.

1201
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,542
<i>Take me. I'll come with you and I'll
tell you everything you need to know.</i>

1202
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:56,958
Please, just don't hurt him.

1203
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:00,917
Get in the car.

1204
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,208
The earring.
You wanted me to find it.

1205
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,167
I love you.

1206
01:31:27,042 --> 01:31:28,042
Mae.

1207
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
She came back.

1208
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,250
Because of me.

1209
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,042
What the hell
did you do to her?

1210
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:49,583
<i>Let's not make this more
difficult than it has to be, huh?</i>

1211
01:31:50,417 --> 01:31:51,417
<i>Swallow.</i>

1212
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,958
<i>Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!</i>

1213
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:55,708
- <i>No more. No.</i>
- <i>Undiluted baca.</i>

1214
01:31:55,792 --> 01:31:58,750
Now, tell me,
where is the boy?

1215
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,792
<i>Soon, the baca
is gonna kick in</i>

1216
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:07,042
and bring back
the Mae I used to know.

1217
01:32:07,833 --> 01:32:09,458
And when it does...

1218
01:32:09,542 --> 01:32:11,625
there's nothing
you'll hold back.

1219
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,500
Nothing you won't do.

1220
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:15,542
No one you won't betray.

1221
01:32:15,625 --> 01:32:16,792
<i>Not the kid...</i>

1222
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,708
- not your boyfriend.
- Oh, God.

1223
01:32:19,792 --> 01:32:22,417
You'll tell me everything you know.
Understand?

1224
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:32,208
<i>Now, tell me
where the kid is.</i>

1225
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:46,292
You already know.

1226
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:51,667
<i>You know.</i>

1227
01:32:52,292 --> 01:32:53,292
Mae?

1228
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:59,667
<i>I told you once,
don't you remember?</i>

1229
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:03,333
<i>At first, I thought it was a
mirage floating in the waves.</i>

1230
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:07,625
White clapboard house.

1231
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:12,167
<i>It saved me once.
And maybe, maybe it can save Freddie, too.</i>

1232
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,792
What are you talkin' about?

1233
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:14,792
Mae.

1234
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:22,875
<i>I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier.</i>

1235
01:33:27,792 --> 01:33:29,375
<i>But you're here now,
aren't you?</i>

1236
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:35,125
<i>We have this one last chance.</i>

1237
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:38,708
Yes, Mae, I'm here.
I'm right here.

1238
01:33:38,792 --> 01:33:41,500
<i>There are so many things
I wanted to tell you.</i>

1239
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:45,708
<i>But I was scared.</i>

1240
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:50,958
<i>You looked at me in a way
no one's ever looked at me.</i>

1241
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:53,375
<i>I wanted to be
that person you saw.</i>

1242
01:33:55,667 --> 01:34:01,875
<i>It's so stupid of me to think
falling in love could save me.</i>

1243
01:34:01,958 --> 01:34:05,083
People like us
don't fall in love.

1244
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:09,500
We, we plummet
to places...

1245
01:34:09,583 --> 01:34:11,208
deep and dark.

1246
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,833
But love?

1247
01:34:14,458 --> 01:34:17,875
<i>Love is the thing
we climb to.</i>

1248
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:22,208
<i>Rung after rung, we,
we pull ourselves out of ourselves...</i>

1249
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:24,417
<i>reaching for something greater.</i>

1250
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:29,542
<i>If we could
just hold on.</i>

1251
01:34:51,375 --> 01:34:54,792
<i>I wish I could've
held on longer.</i>

1252
01:34:57,542 --> 01:35:00,083
Stay. Stay.

1253
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:01,458
<i>I love you...</i>

1254
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,542
Nick.

1255
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:05,625
Nick?

1256
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:08,667
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

1257
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:10,875
The man who's gonna kill you!

1258
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,958
<i>There's only one way out.</i>

1259
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:18,958
Mae, don't. No, no, no.
Wait, no.

1260
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:20,958
- <i>No, no, no.</i>
- Where do you think you're going?

1261
01:35:21,042 --> 01:35:22,958
Mae!

1262
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:25,125
No, no, Mae.
Mae, Mae, Mae, no, no...

1263
01:35:26,417 --> 01:35:27,875
<i>I can't let him
find Freddie.</i>

1264
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:29,042
Stay. Don't...

1265
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:30,167
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1266
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:33,375
No, no...
No. No!

1267
01:35:33,458 --> 01:35:35,167
No, no, no!

1268
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:24,250
Mae was wrong,
I'm not gonna kill you.

1269
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:27,542
'Cause dying is easy.

1270
01:36:27,625 --> 01:36:30,208
A few moments of suffering
and then nothing.

1271
01:36:30,292 --> 01:36:33,708
You deserve more than nothing.
You deserve to remember.

1272
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:37,708
We're going
on a journey.

1273
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:41,083
A journey down a path you tried
to forget but never could.

1274
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:45,083
A journey to your worst fear,
your worst pain.

1275
01:36:45,167 --> 01:36:47,375
How did you get
your scars, Boothe?

1276
01:36:53,083 --> 01:36:55,250
They call 'em
rats of the sky.

1277
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:58,583
They're just doves...

1278
01:36:58,667 --> 01:37:00,000
with dark wings.

1279
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,667
They are as
they're made to be.

1280
01:37:07,167 --> 01:37:08,250
Freak.

1281
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:10,042
I told Joe
we couldn't trust you.

1282
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:12,417
- Ah!
- You been skimmin' off his sales.

1283
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,708
Of course I did.

1284
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,750
This whole town is bent.
Be crooked not to.

1285
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,625
Feel that fire?

1286
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:32,500
Burning like it did
that night.

1287
01:37:32,583 --> 01:37:34,292
But this night will never end.

1288
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:37,375
This night will be with you
for the rest of your life!

1289
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:39,750
This is where
your journey ends!

1290
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,500
They say you can't tell yet...

1291
01:38:06,583 --> 01:38:08,583
but I know it's a boy.

1292
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,792
Don't bother calling security,
all right? We need to talk.

1293
01:38:17,083 --> 01:38:18,083
Sit.

1294
01:38:24,042 --> 01:38:27,500
For a long time, you've known about
your father's affair, haven't you?

1295
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:30,667
Must've been quite a shock to learn
that he'd fathered another child.

1296
01:38:32,708 --> 01:38:34,250
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1297
01:38:34,333 --> 01:38:35,833
Sure you do.

1298
01:38:35,917 --> 01:38:37,167
<i>He was in love
with Elsa.</i>

1299
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:38,708
Don't worry,
my flower.

1300
01:38:38,792 --> 01:38:40,458
<i>And vowed to protect her
and her son.</i>

1301
01:38:40,542 --> 01:38:42,208
I'll always
take care of you.

1302
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:43,792
He was looking for them.

1303
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:46,333
He wanted to make things right
with them before he died.

1304
01:38:46,417 --> 01:38:48,208
- Have you found her yet?
- No, Dad.

1305
01:38:48,292 --> 01:38:50,292
Didn't wanna split
your fortune, did you?

1306
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,000
So, you hired Boothe
to kill them

1307
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:54,208
so you could keep
the money to yourself.

1308
01:38:54,292 --> 01:38:55,333
Bullshit.

1309
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:56,667
Your own mother
tried to tell me.

1310
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:58,208
Walter never liked sharing.

1311
01:38:58,292 --> 01:39:00,042
She just confused
you and your father.

1312
01:39:01,042 --> 01:39:02,333
It's easy to see how.

1313
01:39:03,417 --> 01:39:04,667
Mother gets confused.

1314
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,958
Not about this.

1315
01:39:06,042 --> 01:39:08,125
Boothe proved it
with a phone call.

1316
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,125
It's me.

1317
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,292
I thought he was conspiring
with a woman I knew.

1318
01:39:13,375 --> 01:39:15,250
But I was wrong.

1319
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:17,125
And he couldn't have been
calling your father.

1320
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,250
Your father was
already dead.

1321
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:22,583
And the dead
don't take phone calls.

1322
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:24,417
But you do.

1323
01:39:27,667 --> 01:39:28,917
Should've tossed your phone.

1324
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:35,792
Name your price.

1325
01:39:37,292 --> 01:39:40,542
I'll have as much as you need
once the estate clears.

1326
01:39:40,625 --> 01:39:42,458
I doubt that.

1327
01:39:42,542 --> 01:39:44,583
Your half-brother Freddie, though,
he'll, he'll be quite comfortable.

1328
01:39:46,375 --> 01:39:48,625
- Freddie, he...
- Alive, yeah.

1329
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:51,292
Police picked him up
early this morning.

1330
01:39:51,375 --> 01:39:55,917
<i>Visited a white clapboard house off the
coast of the Keys where they found him...</i>

1331
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,125
<i>safe and sound.</i>

1332
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:02,792
Won't be long before the cops
piece together what happened.

1333
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,125
They'll be here
for you soon.

1334
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:13,375
Go ahead. Do it.

1335
01:40:35,208 --> 01:40:36,792
I won't let them
take me.

1336
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:38,500
Between memory
and oblivion...

1337
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:41,500
I know which torture
I'd choose.

1338
01:40:43,208 --> 01:40:45,750
But you've never done
your own dirty work.

1339
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:47,667
I doubt you have it
in you to start now.

1340
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:54,750
On the count of three,
imagine it.

1341
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:00,042
One, two...

1342
01:41:10,417 --> 01:41:12,042
I hear it, Walter.

1343
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:14,708
I hear it.

1344
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:23,833
Don't worry.
Your father is in great hands.

1345
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:26,125
The tank will keep his body
sustained for years.

1346
01:41:26,208 --> 01:41:27,708
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

1347
01:41:27,792 --> 01:41:29,333
- I'll give you guys a few minutes.
- Thank you.

1348
01:41:34,042 --> 01:41:37,208
If you're thinking about checking
in, trust me, you cannot afford it.

1349
01:41:37,292 --> 01:41:39,375
I burned someone
on purpose.

1350
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:43,958
Such a kidder.

1351
01:41:45,375 --> 01:41:47,083
Joking about something
like that.

1352
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,875
Everyone knows that would get
you more time than murder.

1353
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:50,542
- It's not a joke.
- Okay.

1354
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:57,375
You got a death wish?

1355
01:41:57,458 --> 01:42:00,500
The DA will pluck that little confession
right out of my head with the tank.

1356
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,417
- I want them to.
- What?

1357
01:42:05,708 --> 01:42:07,583
- What are these?
- Reminiscences.

1358
01:42:07,667 --> 01:42:11,292
They belong to Elsa Carine and Cyrus
Boothe, the man who killed Elsa...

1359
01:42:12,208 --> 01:42:13,208
and Mae.

1360
01:42:14,167 --> 01:42:15,208
Mae is dead?

1361
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,625
I'm sorry.

1362
01:42:19,708 --> 01:42:21,750
Take these. I need you
to get them to Avery.

1363
01:42:22,792 --> 01:42:24,667
She'll depose me.

1364
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:26,083
She'll ask about you.

1365
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:27,083
I'm counting on it.

1366
01:42:29,417 --> 01:42:31,083
Sorry, Watts.

1367
01:42:31,167 --> 01:42:33,708
I'd ask someone else, but,
turns out, you're my only friend.

1368
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,167
Yeah.

1369
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,292
I wish I'd fired you
a long time ago.

1370
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,542
Gee, thanks.

1371
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:50,042
I see clearer now all
the things that I missed.

1372
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:55,958
Your best moments
aren't behind you, Emily.

1373
01:42:56,042 --> 01:42:58,000
They're waiting
for your arrival.

1374
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:01,667
Your daughter...

1375
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:04,917
go find her.

1376
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:08,250
There's still time.

1377
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:12,167
You're acting like
I won't see you again.

1378
01:43:13,458 --> 01:43:16,292
You'll see me.
I'll see you.

1379
01:43:16,375 --> 01:43:18,375
You've always
been there for me.

1380
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:21,375
I don't expect
that will change.

1381
01:43:21,458 --> 01:43:23,875
But first, you're gonna
have to hear my confession.

1382
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:29,333
Okay.

1383
01:43:31,708 --> 01:43:34,250
It started,
as you know...

1384
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,125
with a set
of lost keys.

1385
01:43:36,208 --> 01:43:38,500
Only, they were never really
lost in the first place...

1386
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:39,917
not even misplaced.

1387
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:42,667
It started as a con...

1388
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,125
<i>but by the end,
it was something real.</i>

1389
01:43:50,458 --> 01:43:55,542
<i>The city reacted swiftly
to word of Sylvan's crimes.</i>

1390
01:43:55,625 --> 01:43:58,750
<i>Their rage against the barons
had been pent up too long.</i>

1391
01:44:00,583 --> 01:44:02,333
<i>No walls could contain it.</i>

1392
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,500
<i>A trickle became a flood.</i>

1393
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,083
<i>Maybe this time
it would wash the world clean.</i>

1394
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,375
<i>Either way...</i>

1395
01:44:18,458 --> 01:44:19,500
<i>I won't know.</i>

1396
01:44:32,917 --> 01:44:36,542
<i>For my role in exposing
the Sylvan conspiracy...</i>

1397
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,042
<i>Avery cut me a deal.</i>

1398
01:44:40,292 --> 01:44:41,708
<i>I didn't get to walk...</i>

1399
01:44:42,958 --> 01:44:44,333
<i>but I got what I wanted.</i>

1400
01:44:59,583 --> 01:45:00,958
<i>You're going on a journey.</i>

1401
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:04,542
<i>A journey through memory.</i>

1402
01:45:06,417 --> 01:45:08,542
<i>Your destination?</i>

1403
01:45:08,625 --> 01:45:11,417
<i>A place and time
you've been before.</i>

1404
01:45:14,542 --> 01:45:16,042
<i>To reach it...</i>

1405
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:19,333
<i>all you have to do
is follow my voice.</i>

1406
01:45:26,417 --> 01:45:28,292
<i>The past can haunt a man.</i>

1407
01:45:29,792 --> 01:45:30,958
<i>That's what they say.</i>

1408
01:45:33,833 --> 01:45:37,167
<i>That the past is just
a series of moments.</i>

1409
01:45:38,333 --> 01:45:40,625
<i>Each one perfect.</i>

1410
01:45:41,667 --> 01:45:42,792
<i>Complete.</i>

1411
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:47,417
<i>A bead on the necklace of time.</i>

1412
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:57,375
We're closed.

1413
01:45:57,458 --> 01:45:59,417
I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

1414
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,625
I lost my keys on the
way home from work.

1415
01:46:03,042 --> 01:46:04,875
<i>The past
doesn't haunt us.</i>

1416
01:46:06,417 --> 01:46:08,875
<i>Wouldn't even recognize us.</i>

1417
01:46:08,958 --> 01:46:11,875
<i>♪ It seems we stood
And talked ♪</i>

1418
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:14,500
<i>If there are ghosts
to be found...</i>

1419
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,917
<i>it's us who haunt the past.</i>

1420
01:46:19,667 --> 01:46:21,208
<i>We haunt it...</i>

1421
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:22,625
<i>so we can look again.</i>

1422
01:46:24,583 --> 01:46:26,333
<i>See the people we miss...</i>

1423
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:30,083
<i>and the things
we missed about them.</i>

1424
01:46:35,208 --> 01:46:36,917
<i>I see you fully now.</i>

1425
01:46:38,583 --> 01:46:40,542
<i>Your darkness and your light.</i>

1426
01:46:42,583 --> 01:46:44,708
<i>Shimmering...</i>

1427
01:46:44,792 --> 01:46:47,958
<i>like the city at dusk
when it's most beautiful.</i>

1428
01:46:49,042 --> 01:46:50,250
Tell me a story.

1429
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:54,333
A story? What kind of story?

1430
01:46:56,083 --> 01:46:57,833
One with a happy ending.

1431
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:01,083
No such thing
as a happy ending.

1432
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:03,375
All endings are sad.

1433
01:47:03,458 --> 01:47:05,417
Especially if the story
was happy.

1434
01:47:08,208 --> 01:47:11,042
Then tell me a happy story,
but end it in the middle.

1435
01:47:27,667 --> 01:47:28,958
- Grandma?
- Mm?

1436
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:31,875
You miss him...

1437
01:47:31,958 --> 01:47:33,792
don't you?

1438
01:47:33,875 --> 01:47:36,250
Missing people
is a part of this world.

1439
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,125
Without that sadness...

1440
01:47:40,292 --> 01:47:41,917
you can't taste the sweet.

1441
01:47:44,333 --> 01:47:46,958
A long time ago,
we both chose our endings.

1442
01:47:47,833 --> 01:47:49,042
He turned back...

1443
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:51,125
and I looked ahead.

1444
01:47:52,667 --> 01:47:56,750
I like to think that we both
chose right for ourselves.

1445
01:47:56,833 --> 01:47:58,708
<i>As I held her
in my arms,</i>

1446
01:47:58,792 --> 01:48:00,292
<i>I thought of a story.</i>

1447
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,958
<i>It's a tragedy...</i>

1448
01:48:04,042 --> 01:48:05,792
<i>but only if you
stop at the end.</i>

1449
01:48:07,083 --> 01:48:09,250
Ever hear of Orpheus
and Eurydice?

1450
01:48:11,167 --> 01:48:13,042
They were a couple
very in love.

1451
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,583
Until one day Eurydice died.

1452
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:18,250
That's a horrible story.

1453
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:19,708
I'm not in the middle yet.

1454
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:22,792
Orpheus descended to Hell...

1455
01:48:22,875 --> 01:48:25,083
begged the Devil
to release her, until...

1456
01:48:26,167 --> 01:48:28,292
finally, the Devil agreed...

1457
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:29,708
with one condition.

1458
01:48:31,333 --> 01:48:33,667
He couldn't look back
until they had escaped.

1459
01:48:35,542 --> 01:48:36,792
And what happened?

1460
01:48:39,708 --> 01:48:41,208
Orpheus took her by the hand...

1461
01:48:42,125 --> 01:48:44,292
and led her back to life.

1462
01:48:44,375 --> 01:48:46,500
And they lived
happily ever after?

1463
01:48:51,042 --> 01:48:52,667
What other ending
could there be?

1464
01:49:29,676 --> 01:49:34,676
