<i>Look, see a world</i>

2
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:18,888
<i>that holds more wonders than
any since the Earth was born.</i>

3
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:27,430
<i>And of all who reigned o'er,
none had renown like the boy</i>

4
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:31,067
<i>who pulled sword from stone.</i>

5
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:36,506
<i>But this is not that king...</i>

6
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,809
<i>...nor is this his song.</i>

7
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:44,814
<i>Let me tell you instead
a new tale.</i>

8
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,917
<i>I'll lay it down
as I've heard it told.</i>

9
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,820
<i>Its letters sent,
its history pressed,</i>

10
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:54,524
<i>of an adventure
brave and bold.</i>

11
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,528
<i>Forever set,
in heart, in stone,</i>

12

15
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:08,858
Christ is born.

16
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:13,796
Christ is born indeed.

17
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,310
Where are
you going?

18
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,877
To church!

19
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:29,745
Why?

20
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,885
My boots.
Hello, Agnes.

21
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,688
Where are my boots?

22
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:47,630
You a knight yet?

23
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:48,698
What?

24
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,199
You a knight yet?

25
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,269
- Not yet.
- Better hurry up.

26
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:55,204
I've got time.

27
00:03:56,172 --> 00:03:57,874
I've got lots
of time.

28
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,943
Hey! Essel.

29
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,615
- Hey, slow down.
- Hurry up!

30
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,015
Essel.

31
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,386
Essel.

32
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:12,822
Let's just stay here. Come on.
Let's just stay here.

33
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:17,293
- Get up.
- No.

34
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,596
I'm not ready yet.

35
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:22,899
I'm not ready.

36
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,307
Merry Christmas,
Gryngelot.

37
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,471
Where have
you been?

38
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:35,706
At Mass.

39
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:38,642
- You, at Mass?
- Yeah.

40
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,076
All night?

41
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:42,778
Yes.

42
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,448
Well,
where are your boots?

43
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,182
What?

44
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:48,418
Where are...

45
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:53,657
You do smell like
you've been at Mass.

46
00:05:53,724 --> 00:05:56,892
What, have you been drinking
the sacrament all night?

47
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,961
I love you, Mother.

48
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:24,220
You are not dressed.

49
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:28,558
I've got no guts
for merriment this year.

50
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,026
But it's Christmas.

51
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:31,728
There'll be
more Christmases,

52
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:35,264
more feasts,
more glad tidings.

53
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:43,340
You go,
make merry.

54
00:06:45,742 --> 00:06:47,311
And tell me
what you see.

55
00:08:44,594 --> 00:08:47,096
Bring young
Gawain here.

56
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:56,473
The king
would speak with you.

57
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,746
Where is thy mother?

58
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:39,549
She was not feeling
herself, my lord.

59
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:44,987
Then come. Sit here, besides us.

60
00:09:45,054 --> 00:09:47,056
Besides me
and my queen.

61
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,594
That is not
my place.

62
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:55,732
No. Let it
be, today.

63
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:59,336
Its owner
is away.

64
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,538
Who knows when
he will return?

65
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,140
Please.

66
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:16,786
Good to see
you, Gawain.

67
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:21,625
Good to have one's
family by one's side.

68
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,694
One's blood.

69
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,331
Surely your
knights have

70
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:29,633
spilled enough blood
in your name

71
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,535
to bind them closer
to you than I.

72
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,436
True.

73
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,774
But you are
my sister's boy,

74
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,076
queefed from
her womb.

75
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,814
They are not.

76
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:49,352
I look out upon my friends
here today and I see...

77
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,722
songs...

78
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:59,329
no muse could ever
sing or dream of.

79
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:05,100
But I turn to thee
and I see what?

80
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:10,874
I recognize but I
do not know thee.

81
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:15,412
I say this not in
reproach, but regret

82
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:17,914
that I have never asked
you to sit at my side

83
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,449
before this day

84
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:24,286
or upon my knee when
thy was newborn.

85
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,326
But now
it is Christmas,

86
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,228
and I wish
to build bridges.

87
00:11:35,932 --> 00:11:38,668
So before
we make merry...

88
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:44,106
you make
for me a gift.

89
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,677
You tell me a tale of yourself,

90
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,580
so that I might
know thee.

91
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,665
I have none to tell, King.

92
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,636
Yet.

93
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,673
You have none
to tell yet.

94
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,310
Yet.

95
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,912
Look around you,
young Gawain.

96
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,181
What do you see?

97
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:34,791
I see legends.

98
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,763
Do not take your place
amongst them idly.

99
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:43,667
Hmm.

100
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:53,208
So who else then...

101
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:55,712
<i>hmm?</i>

102
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:02,852
Friends...

103
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:09,059
Brothers...

104
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,860
Brothers...

105
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,462
Brothers and...

106
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,531
- <i>sisters all.</i>
- <i>...sisters all.</i>

107
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,200
I thank thee

108
00:13:18,267 --> 00:13:22,204
for breaking bread with
me this blessed day.

109
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,808
<i>And it is blessed...</i>

110
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:31,081
for out my window

111
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:32,549
this morn I looked,

112
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:35,452
and I saw a land

113
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,587
shaped...

114
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:41,256
by your hands.

115
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:48,465
You have lain those same
hands upon our Saxon brethren,

116
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:52,702
<i>who now in your shadow
bow their heads</i>

117
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,739
like babes.

118
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,642
Peace, peace you have
brought to your kingdom,

119
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:01,711
so it is in peace
that I...

120
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:05,949
I now say to you...

121
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,385
that I...

122
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:13,323
I am the luckiest
here today...

123
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:18,293
because I am
amongst thee.

124
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:23,600
I am amongst thee.

125
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,573
So before
we celebrate

126
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,510
the birth
of our Christ,

127
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:36,679
<i>let us honor
one of our own</i>

128
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,948
who has done great
things in His name.

129
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,352
<i>So a tale, or...</i>

130
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:46,022
Or a show perhaps.

131
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,323
What have thee?

132
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:52,395
Who can regale me
and my queen

133
00:14:52,462 --> 00:14:54,898
with some myth

134
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:57,567
<i>or canto</i>

135
00:14:59,102 --> 00:15:01,004
of thine
own purport?

136
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,343
Hold.

137
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:23,746
<i>Oh, Greatest Of Kings,</i>

138
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:27,750
<i>indulge me in this friendly
Christmas game.</i>

139
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:29,353
<i>Let whichever
of your knights</i>

140
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,921
<i>is boldest of blood
and wildest of heart</i>

141
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:34,657
<i>step forth,
take up arms,</i>

142
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,627
<i>and try with honor
to land a blow against me.</i>

143
00:17:37,694 --> 00:17:39,896
<i>Whomsoever nicks me</i>

144
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:42,732
<i>shall lay claim
to this, my arm.</i>

145
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,337
<i>It's glory and riches
shall be thine.</i>

146
00:17:46,403 --> 00:17:47,770
But...

147
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:53,576
thy champ must bind
himself to this:

148
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:56,012
Should he land
a blow,

149
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,781
then one year
and Yuletide hence,

150
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,750
he must seek me
out yonder,

151
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:04,187
to the Green Chapel
six nights to the North.

152
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:06,556
He shall find me there
and bend the knee

153
00:18:06,622 --> 00:18:08,257
and let me strike him
in return.

154
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:11,627
Be it a scratch on the cheek
or a cut on the throat,

155
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:14,163
I will return
what was given to me,

156
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,134
and then in trust
and friendship we shall part.

157
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:22,238
Who, then,
who is willing to engage with me?

158
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,212
Help. Queen.

159
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,771
This challenge
is thine own?

160
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,978
Though my will longs

161
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:05,315
to leap across this
table and meet thee,

162
00:19:05,382 --> 00:19:07,550
my body will
not follow.

163
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:17,160
Surely there is one
amongst us here

164
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:23,099
who will meet this
knight on his terms.

165
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:28,004
I will do it.

166
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,140
I will meet him.

167
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:36,045
I will meet thee.

168
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:42,319
You understand
this challenge?

169
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:43,619
I do.

170
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:48,057
I think I do.

171
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:57,233
Remember,
it is only a game.

172
00:20:11,147 --> 00:20:12,316
I need a sword.

173
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,555
I need...
I need a sword.

174
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,656
Gawain.

175
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:08,372
Have at me,
Green Knight.

176
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,024
Make a move
or I shall make mine.

177
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,109
What is this?

178
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:49,145
A trick?

179
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:54,451
Stand up
and face me!

180
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:07,698
What do you
expect me to do?

181
00:22:07,763 --> 00:22:09,466
Have courage.

182
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:23,246
Very well.

183
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:28,751
Very well.

184
00:22:30,086 --> 00:22:31,988
You laid down
your challenge.

185
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:37,361
I accepted it and
I accept it still.

186
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,499
Never forget
what happened here

187
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,602
upon this
Christmas Day!

188
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:56,005
One year hence...

189
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:07,303
What did it
feel like?

190
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,013
What did it feel
like when you...

191
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:25,322
Like cutting
a melon in two.

192
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:29,693
And what does
that feel like?

193
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:33,797
<i>Like nothing.</i>

194
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:41,103
Were you afraid?

195
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:43,907
No.

196
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:45,475
Are you just
saying that?

197
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,480
<i>I am here,
and he is not.</i>

198
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:01,992
The king lent
me his sword,

199
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:03,426
did you know that?

200
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:05,495
You held it?

201
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:07,697
Well, I did more
than hold it.

202
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:12,369
Behold, Brave
Sir Gawain,

203
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,671
chopper of heads...

204
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:16,439
...severer of melons,

205
00:27:16,506 --> 00:27:17,741
who cannot...

206
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,844
...get it up.

207
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:51,106
You're Gawain,
aren't you?

208
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:54,076
Nah, you must
be mistaken.

209
00:27:54,143 --> 00:27:56,580
No, no,
you're him.

210
00:27:56,646 --> 00:28:00,483
You're always here.
Always about.

211
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,853
Scarcely leave
upright most nights.

212
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,590
But not
on Christmas.

213
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:08,325
Have you heard?

214
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:11,962
This boy slew
the Green Knight.

215
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:13,295
With his own axe,

216
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:15,498
he lopped off
the giant's head,

217
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:18,602
and now he
drinks with us!

218
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:21,705
But his
mother's a witch.

219
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:17,861
Rise.

220
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:20,262
Rise.

221
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,901
Sit.

222
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:34,911
I've been
waiting for you.

223
00:29:37,347 --> 00:29:39,582
Did you not
hear me calling?

224
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,578
My tooth hurts.

225
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,585
Another year
nearly gone already.

226
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:18,922
Have you thought
what you will do

227
00:30:18,988 --> 00:30:20,255
when Christmas comes?

228
00:30:23,126 --> 00:30:24,894
Was it not just a game?

229
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:28,765
Perhaps.

230
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:31,801
But it is
not complete.

231
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,410
You truly believe
he's sitting in a chapel,

232
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:43,713
counting the hours,

233
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,483
whiling away the year
waiting for me to come?

234
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:49,986
Well, I do not know.

235
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:54,524
You will tell me.

236
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,560
You must seek him out.

237
00:30:58,394 --> 00:31:01,231
And if death awaits me?

238
00:31:01,296 --> 00:31:03,032
Oh, I do not know
of any man

239
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:05,902
who has not marched up to
greet death before his time.

240
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:13,576
Why are you holding me
to this light?

241
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,722
Is it wrong to want
greatness for you?

242
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,426
I fear I am not meant
for greatness.

243
00:31:32,796 --> 00:31:33,830
Mm.

244
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:13,336
You have mud
on your face.

245
00:34:13,189 --> 00:34:14,757
May the Blessed Virgin

246
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:17,428
keep your five
fingers strong,

247
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:19,829
your five senses sharp.

248
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:22,899
<i>May her five joys
inspire you.</i>

249
00:34:22,966 --> 00:34:26,269
<i>The five wounds of her
son give you fervor.</i>

250
00:34:26,337 --> 00:34:29,839
And the five virtues
of a knight light your way.

251
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,710
Keep thy covenant,
young Gawain.

252
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:36,212
And if God smiles on thee,

253
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:40,083
then hurry thee back.

254
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,620
Thy seat besides us waits.

255
00:34:58,634 --> 00:35:00,636
Are you really
going to go?

256
00:35:01,372 --> 00:35:02,705
Should I?

257
00:35:03,973 --> 00:35:06,809
I like your head better
where it is.

258
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:09,979
<i>I gave my word.
I made a covenant.</i>

259
00:35:10,046 --> 00:35:13,950
This is how
silly men perish.

260
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:16,285
<i>Or how brave
men become great.</i>

261
00:35:16,353 --> 00:35:17,854
<i>Why greatness?</i>

262
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:21,224
Why is goodness
not enough?

263
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:32,001
Take this now.

264
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:37,540
Wear it about your
waist as you go.

265
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:42,078
And if you wear it
still when you return...

266
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:43,146
Will I return?

267
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:45,648
When you return,

268
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:48,785
you will come with
your head held high.

269
00:35:48,851 --> 00:35:52,855
I promise, you will
not come to harm.

270
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,926
And, boy...

271
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:00,997
My boy...

272
00:36:02,598 --> 00:36:04,167
do not waste this.

273
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:23,653
Gawain!
Gawain!

274
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:27,090
I've got a sword!

275
00:36:31,594 --> 00:36:34,897
Gawain!
Great tide.

276
00:36:37,534 --> 00:36:39,536
Good luck!

277
00:36:39,602 --> 00:36:41,871
Good luck,
Gawain!

278
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:14,331
<i>Do you
still fancy me?</i>

279
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:18,935
Do I make you happy?

280
00:38:21,638 --> 00:38:23,574
<i>Yes.</i>

281
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,144
<i>Even though I'm
here and you're there?</i>

282
00:38:30,713 --> 00:38:32,148
<i>Yes.</i>

283
00:38:34,817 --> 00:38:37,753
<i>What will you say if I
asked you to make me your lady?</i>

284
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:41,325
- A lady?
- Your lady.

285
00:38:44,494 --> 00:38:47,397
I could give you more
gold than any lady has.

286
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:50,032
I already
have your gold.

287
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:58,040
What if I wanted to
sit by your side and...

288
00:38:59,275 --> 00:39:01,311
take your
hand and...

289
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:04,113
have your ear?

290
00:39:05,748 --> 00:39:07,451
What will you
say to that?

291
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,228
"Why, yes, Essel.

292
00:39:19,295 --> 00:39:21,264
"I'd like that
very much.

293
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:27,937
"You may have my ear
and my hand and heart.

294
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,776
"And I will be king
and you my queen.

295
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,514
"You'll be
my lady...

296
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,217
"and I'll be
your man."

297
00:42:17,106 --> 00:42:18,608
Who are you?

298
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:22,144
Just a traveler,
friend.

299
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:23,946
You look like
a knight.

300
00:42:25,214 --> 00:42:27,350
Just passing through.

301
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:31,053
Ah. I take it you'll want
some of the shares, so, huh?

302
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:33,523
Of what?

303
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,024
All of this!

304
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,195
Why weren't
they buried?

305
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:42,666
All dead.
All dead.

306
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:44,300
No one
to bury 'em.

307
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:47,838
Though you know,
nature will do its trick.

308
00:42:47,904 --> 00:42:50,973
She'll suck 'em in
and tuck 'em tight.

309
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,679
Eh, in saying that,

310
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:58,348
I do have two brothers
out here somewhere.

311
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:03,820
And they marched off.
They never came home.

312
00:43:03,887 --> 00:43:05,889
You know,
if it weren't for my ma,

313
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:08,325
I would've been here.
I would've been here!

314
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:09,826
I would've been
here too!

315
00:43:11,394 --> 00:43:13,363
They all came
here!

316
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:17,734
Though I'd have
lasted longer.

317
00:43:19,168 --> 00:43:20,670
The king,
they say...

318
00:43:20,737 --> 00:43:23,005
They say the king,

319
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:27,076
he killed 960
all on his lonesome.

320
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:29,245
- Nine hundred, eh?
- Uh-huh.

321
00:43:29,312 --> 00:43:31,046
Now, if it was me,

322
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:34,751
I'da stayed upright long
enough to take my shot.

323
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:39,956
That's a nice
axe you got.

324
00:43:40,022 --> 00:43:41,958
You do some fighting
with that axe?

325
00:43:42,024 --> 00:43:43,660
- Here and there.
- Here?

326
00:43:44,895 --> 00:43:46,463
Only there.

327
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,063
Here, I'm just
passing through.

328
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,164
To where?

329
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:50,667
I go North.

330
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:52,903
North, oh!

331
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:54,971
North is a direction, all right.

332
00:43:55,037 --> 00:43:56,038
Just North?

333
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:57,374
To the Green Chapel.

334
00:43:59,442 --> 00:44:00,242
Oh!

335
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:01,311
Do you know of it?

336
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:03,313
The Green Chapel, eh?

337
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:06,850
There's a stream
yonder.

338
00:44:06,917 --> 00:44:08,585
It runs Northlike.

339
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:10,554
I mean, if I've...
If I've got my bearing.

340
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,355
Yeah, yeah,
it runs Northlike.

341
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:15,057
But if you follow that
for a day and a half,

342
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:16,493
you'll come
to a chapel.

343
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,227
At least I think
it's a chapel.

344
00:44:18,294 --> 00:44:20,430
It's, uh... It's,
uh, yeah, it's...

345
00:44:20,497 --> 00:44:21,765
It's not green
on the whole,

346
00:44:21,831 --> 00:44:23,667
but I mean, it's
definitely greenish,

347
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:26,302
with the moss and the, uh...
the rot and ruins,

348
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:28,137
but perhaps it's
what you seek.

349
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:30,205
The stream
is yonder?

350
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:31,140
Mmm-hmm.

351
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:32,676
It's this way.

352
00:44:32,742 --> 00:44:35,210
Past the field,
where the forest meets.

353
00:44:35,277 --> 00:44:38,180
I will seek it out.
My thanks to you.

354
00:44:38,247 --> 00:44:39,950
My thanks to you.

355
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,718
Come on.

356
00:44:41,785 --> 00:44:43,787
Are my directions
not worth anything to you?

357
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:45,889
My thanks.

358
00:44:45,956 --> 00:44:50,060
I said, are my directions
not worth anything to you?

359
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:57,199
I mean, a knight like you
could spare a wretch like me

360
00:44:57,266 --> 00:45:01,203
just a small,
small act of kindness.

361
00:45:07,176 --> 00:45:09,412
Here. A kindness.

362
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:10,513
Oh!

363
00:45:12,048 --> 00:45:13,383
Wait.

364
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:22,191
Northlike. See?

365
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,294
Thank you.

366
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:27,030
Remember the stream.

367
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,565
I will.

368
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:33,503
'Cause it gets tricky.

369
00:45:45,115 --> 00:45:47,282
Here you go, boy.

370
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,785
That's a good boy.

371
00:45:49,986 --> 00:45:51,321
Good boy.

372
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:56,191
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:30,860
Hello, there.

374
00:46:31,828 --> 00:46:33,329
Hello.

375
00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:43,840
Now, now.

376
00:46:52,247 --> 00:46:53,516
- Please.
- Yeah, please?

377
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:55,452
- Please. Please. Please!
- Please!

378
00:46:55,518 --> 00:46:56,820
- Please.
- Please!

379
00:47:00,023 --> 00:47:02,692
Please!
Please! Please! Please!

380
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:06,896
Please.

381
00:47:13,937 --> 00:47:15,004
Oh.

382
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,541
Oh.

383
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:24,447
'Tweren't enough.
Just 'tweren't enough.

384
00:47:26,483 --> 00:47:28,218
Hey, hey, hey!
Where you off to, huh?

385
00:47:28,283 --> 00:47:29,486
Where you off to?
A knightly quest?

386
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:31,387
I'm not a knight.

387
00:47:32,254 --> 00:47:33,456
But you said
you were.

388
00:47:33,523 --> 00:47:35,492
I never said that.
You said that.

389
00:47:35,558 --> 00:47:36,760
I never said
I was a knight.

390
00:47:36,826 --> 00:47:39,028
- But are you?
- No! No, I'm not.

391
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:40,530
Oh.
Hmm.

392
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:41,931
- Well, you look like one.
- Aye.

393
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:44,299
Smells like a knight.

394
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:56,679
- Oh...
- Please...

395
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:02,752
Yeah.

396
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,726
Oh. Oh!

397
00:48:12,162 --> 00:48:13,563
Ah.

398
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:15,732
Whoa!

399
00:48:16,933 --> 00:48:18,201
Whoo!

400
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:20,603
Yeah!

401
00:48:24,774 --> 00:48:28,411
Just tell me, then.
Is there really a chapel?

402
00:48:31,514 --> 00:48:32,882
You're in it.

403
00:49:08,484 --> 00:49:10,353
Whoa!
Watch it.

404
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:13,256
Let me
hold that.

405
00:49:20,763 --> 00:49:22,599
It suits me.

406
00:49:26,169 --> 00:49:27,704
This suits
me, huh?

407
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:38,615
You rest your bones,
my brave little knight.

408
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:43,820
I'll finish your
quest for you.

409
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:48,925
I'll finish it good.

410
00:49:54,797 --> 00:49:57,634
Hey!
Where are you going?

411
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:01,004
- Hey!
- Hyah!

412
00:53:33,649 --> 00:53:34,951
Gryngelot!

413
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,760
Hello.

414
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:11,601
What are you
doing in my bed?

415
00:57:22,978 --> 00:57:24,847
What are you doing
in my bed?

416
00:57:26,148 --> 00:57:27,484
I'm very sorry.
I... I did not see you.

417
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,353
I thought there
was no one about.

418
00:57:29,419 --> 00:57:30,721
I did not mean
to offend thee.

419
00:57:30,787 --> 00:57:32,088
Wait.

420
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:35,024
Did my father
send for you?

421
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:39,261
No. He did not.

422
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:41,631
I do not know
your father.

423
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:44,266
I am just a lost traveler,
seeking rest for the night,

424
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:45,802
but I will
leave forthwith.

425
00:57:45,868 --> 00:57:47,337
Where are you going?

426
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:51,273
Home.

427
00:57:54,444 --> 00:57:56,011
I'm headed home.

428
00:57:57,381 --> 00:57:59,115
And you've lost
your way?

429
00:58:00,751 --> 00:58:02,218
Yes.

430
00:58:02,284 --> 00:58:04,253
I've lost something
as well.

431
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:09,659
Will you
help me find it?

432
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:14,296
What are you doing?

433
00:58:14,364 --> 00:58:16,265
- I was just...
- Do not touch me.

434
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:18,934
A knight should
know better.

435
00:58:36,185 --> 00:58:38,321
What is your
name, my lady?

436
00:58:38,388 --> 00:58:40,189
I'm called
Winifred.

437
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:42,925
You heard of me?

438
00:58:42,992 --> 00:58:44,361
No.

439
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,338
There.

440
00:59:00,009 --> 00:59:02,077
What is it
I'm looking for?

441
00:59:02,144 --> 00:59:03,513
My head.

442
00:59:05,816 --> 00:59:08,951
Your head is on your
neck, my lady.

443
00:59:09,018 --> 00:59:11,688
No. It is not.

444
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:16,025
It might look like it
is, but it is not.

445
00:59:17,694 --> 00:59:19,496
It is in the spring.

446
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:27,136
Well, how did it happen
to get there?

447
00:59:28,805 --> 00:59:31,408
A lord came seeking
shelter, like thee.

448
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:34,544
Perhaps
he was thee.

449
00:59:35,946 --> 00:59:37,213
- Was he?
- No.

450
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:38,582
You certain?

451
00:59:38,648 --> 00:59:40,015
Yes.

452
00:59:41,618 --> 00:59:43,720
This lord
sought to lay with me.

453
00:59:45,455 --> 00:59:48,057
I fought him off,
but he returned in the night

454
00:59:49,158 --> 00:59:52,027
and broke down
my door.

455
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:54,230
I tried to flee,
but he cut off my head.

456
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:57,667
He threw it in the spring,
and now, try as I might,

457
00:59:57,734 --> 00:59:59,268
I cannot get at it.

458
01:00:01,805 --> 01:00:03,340
My lady...

459
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:07,444
My lady.

460
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:11,146
Are you real,
or are you a spirit?

461
01:00:12,214 --> 01:00:13,617
What is the difference?

462
01:00:14,718 --> 01:00:16,118
I just need my head.

463
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:26,596
As will I before
the year is out.

464
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,409
If I go in there
and find it,

465
01:00:39,476 --> 01:00:41,210
what would you offer
me in exchange?

466
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:44,381
Why would you
ask me that?

467
01:00:45,448 --> 01:00:47,484
Why would you ever
ask me that?

468
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:39,101
<i>Gawain...</i>

469
01:02:38,795 --> 01:02:40,295
My lady.

470
01:03:07,157 --> 01:03:08,625
Now I can see thee.

471
01:03:09,492 --> 01:03:10,927
And I will strike
thee down

472
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:12,629
with every care
I have for thee.

473
01:03:14,831 --> 01:03:16,866
The Green Knight
is someone you know.

474
01:05:55,592 --> 01:05:59,095
Well, come on in
if you want.

475
01:10:41,978 --> 01:10:45,748
Hey! Hey!

476
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:50,753
Which direction
are you headed?

477
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:53,423
Might a weary traverse the
valley on your shoulder?

478
01:14:12,422 --> 01:14:14,056
Friend!

479
01:14:18,194 --> 01:14:19,496
Welcome!

480
01:15:09,211 --> 01:15:11,147
Easy now, easy.

481
01:15:11,213 --> 01:15:13,249
- Who are you?
- Have no fear.

482
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:15,786
- You're among friends.
- Where are my clothes?

483
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:18,488
Shh. Easy.

484
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:19,955
Wha...

485
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:23,025
What day is it?

486
01:15:23,092 --> 01:15:27,229
It is December
the 21st.

487
01:15:27,296 --> 01:15:31,401
Oh, fear not,
Sir Gawain.

488
01:15:31,468 --> 01:15:34,036
You've only slept
through the night.

489
01:15:34,103 --> 01:15:35,971
How do you
know my name?

490
01:15:36,038 --> 01:15:38,442
I know more
than just your name.

491
01:15:42,978 --> 01:15:44,947
You must eat.

492
01:15:45,014 --> 01:15:49,419
See, upon the new year,
I travel to the West.

493
01:15:49,486 --> 01:15:53,824
Came you one week hence and
an empty home greet you.

494
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,792
Till then, though,
I will hunt.

495
01:15:55,859 --> 01:15:58,495
I will hunt,
you shall rest

496
01:15:58,562 --> 01:16:01,230
and we shall both be
all the better for it.

497
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:03,700
Ah.

498
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,969
And here is our friend, my lady,

499
01:16:07,036 --> 01:16:08,738
fresh from
his slumbers.

500
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,702
And here, friend,

501
01:16:38,768 --> 01:16:40,904
is your
breakfast

502
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:43,373
to replenish
your strength.

503
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,141
Surely, you
will need it.

504
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,644
Why is that?

505
01:16:49,178 --> 01:16:51,481
Because you are
brave, Sir Gawain,

506
01:16:51,548 --> 01:16:53,817
come to face
the Green Knight.

507
01:16:53,884 --> 01:16:57,119
I dare say every
table in this land

508
01:16:57,186 --> 01:16:59,689
has heard of you
and sung your song.

509
01:16:59,756 --> 01:17:03,292
Sir Gawain, the finest
and most virtuous knight,

510
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,564
seeking his destiny
across these lands.

511
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:09,933
Perhaps you think
that I am something I'm not.

512
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,003
Such as what?

513
01:17:13,068 --> 01:17:15,170
How long will you stay with us?

514
01:17:15,237 --> 01:17:17,507
I must make my
appointment by Christmas.

515
01:17:17,574 --> 01:17:20,377
I will eat and give thanks
and then take my leave.

516
01:17:20,443 --> 01:17:22,144
Nonsense.
Don't you know?

517
01:17:22,211 --> 01:17:24,514
The Green Chapel
is not far.

518
01:17:26,115 --> 01:17:27,317
Do you
know of it?

519
01:17:27,384 --> 01:17:28,919
You are
very nearly there.

520
01:17:28,985 --> 01:17:30,820
It's down the river,
not one day's journey.

521
01:17:34,056 --> 01:17:36,058
Are you certain
it is that close?

522
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:41,130
You are at the end
of your quest, Gawain.

523
01:17:41,196 --> 01:17:44,467
A little sooner than
you expected, perhaps.

524
01:17:44,534 --> 01:17:46,403
But such is the case for us all.

525
01:17:49,204 --> 01:17:51,140
Here is what
will happen.

526
01:17:51,206 --> 01:17:56,012
<i>On Christmas morn,
we will send you on your way.</i>

527
01:17:56,078 --> 01:17:57,514
<i>And by nightfall,</i>

528
01:17:57,581 --> 01:18:00,483
<i>you will be at the
doorway of your destiny.</i>

529
01:18:02,151 --> 01:18:04,487
So stay
a while. Rest.

530
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:08,458
And make
yourself content.

531
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:00,510
What did
you find?

532
01:19:05,815 --> 01:19:08,685
I never knew so many
books even existed.

533
01:19:08,752 --> 01:19:10,587
Have you...
Have you read them all?

534
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:12,455
Yes.

535
01:19:12,522 --> 01:19:14,256
All of them
I've read.

536
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:18,828
Some I've written,
some I've copied.

537
01:19:20,162 --> 01:19:22,231
They're tales
I've heard,

538
01:19:22,297 --> 01:19:25,135
songs that have
been sung to me.

539
01:19:25,234 --> 01:19:30,305
I write them down
and sometimes...

540
01:19:30,373 --> 01:19:32,742
Don't tell
anyone this.

541
01:19:32,809 --> 01:19:35,612
Sometimes when I see
room for improvements...

542
01:19:38,081 --> 01:19:39,315
I make them.

543
01:19:42,184 --> 01:19:44,587
- Do you like books?
- Yes.

544
01:19:45,689 --> 01:19:46,756
Well...

545
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,525
Why don't you take
one with you?

546
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:50,160
I couldn't.

547
01:19:50,225 --> 01:19:52,662
Oh, but it is
nearly Christmas.

548
01:19:52,729 --> 01:19:54,497
Here.

549
01:19:54,564 --> 01:19:56,231
This one's for you.

550
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:09,746
I thank you.

551
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:16,419
Should not a knight offer
a lady a kiss in thanks?

552
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:36,906
Will you sit for me?

553
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:39,241
Sit for you?

554
01:20:41,778 --> 01:20:43,012
For a portrait.

555
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:45,882
Ah. I've had my
portrait made already.

556
01:20:45,949 --> 01:20:47,383
Not by me.

557
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:15,111
"Ant love
is to myn herte gon

558
01:21:15,178 --> 01:21:16,846
"With one spere so kene..."

559
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:18,081
Hold very still.

560
01:21:18,148 --> 01:21:21,317
"Nyht ant day
my blod hit drynkes

561
01:21:21,384 --> 01:21:23,586
"Myn herte deth me tene."

562
01:21:46,676 --> 01:21:50,380
That's a very
queer painting.

563
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:08,097
What's that?

564
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:12,535
What?

565
01:22:16,005 --> 01:22:17,040
This.

566
01:22:18,174 --> 01:22:19,542
It's a token.

567
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:22,745
For what?
For good luck?

568
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:24,848
For love?

569
01:22:27,851 --> 01:22:29,953
No.

570
01:22:30,019 --> 01:22:32,956
Surely a knight
knows something of love.

571
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,792
I don't.

572
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:38,895
Truly?

573
01:23:03,987 --> 01:23:05,088
<i>Gawain!</i>

574
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:08,591
Look what I have
brought you!

575
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:17,400
When I dispersed of him,
I thought what a gift!

576
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:20,036
What a gift
for my new friend.

577
01:23:20,103 --> 01:23:21,537
What shall
I do with it?

578
01:23:21,604 --> 01:23:23,673
Well, take it with you
for your journey.

579
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,876
I thought you said
it was not far.

580
01:23:26,943 --> 01:23:30,680
I mean your journey
home, after.

581
01:23:45,962 --> 01:23:49,165
Let us make a promise
to each other.

582
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,637
I hunt tomorrow
and the day after.

583
01:23:55,872 --> 01:23:58,241
Whatever the forest
offers me,

584
01:23:58,308 --> 01:24:01,378
I will bring you
home the best.

585
01:24:01,444 --> 01:24:03,880
And you
give me in turn

586
01:24:03,947 --> 01:24:06,482
whatever you might
receive here.

587
01:24:08,952 --> 01:24:13,089
What might I receive here
that is not already yours?

588
01:24:14,023 --> 01:24:16,393
Who knows?

589
01:24:16,459 --> 01:24:19,696
This house is full
of strange things.

590
01:24:22,532 --> 01:24:24,133
But then again,

591
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,570
I see things everywhere
that bear no logic.

592
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:33,543
Have you ever seen
a hawk kill a horse?

593
01:24:35,412 --> 01:24:37,747
Just swoop
down and...

594
01:24:38,781 --> 01:24:41,818
Phew. It's terrible.

595
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:46,089
Every man should see
it at least once.

596
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:50,994
But that is the world.

597
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:56,899
And the world is fit
for all manner of mysteries.

598
01:24:59,602 --> 01:25:02,839
A man's home, though,
should be safe from all that.

599
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,411
One wall joined
with another,

600
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:09,612
line and plumb.

601
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,181
Good, strong walls,

602
01:25:14,385 --> 01:25:15,852
and a fire within.

603
01:25:16,853 --> 01:25:19,655
Why is he green,
do you think?

604
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,291
The knight?

605
01:25:22,359 --> 01:25:23,793
Yes.

606
01:25:25,429 --> 01:25:27,230
Was he born
that way?

607
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:30,933
Perhaps it is the color of
his blood when he blushes.

608
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,503
But why green?

609
01:25:33,536 --> 01:25:34,937
Why not blue

610
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,342
or red?

611
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:40,877
Because he is not
of this earth.

612
01:25:40,943 --> 01:25:42,845
But green
is the color of earth,

613
01:25:42,912 --> 01:25:45,014
of living things,
of life.

614
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,785
- And of rot.
- Yes.

615
01:25:50,286 --> 01:25:51,788
Yes.

616
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:57,894
We deck our halls with
it and dye our linens.

617
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,063
But should it come
creeping up the cobbles,

618
01:26:00,129 --> 01:26:02,965
we scrub it out,
fast as we can.

619
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:08,771
When it blooms beneath our
skin, we bleed it out.

620
01:26:10,441 --> 01:26:13,643
And when we,
together all,

621
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:17,146
find that our reach
has exceeded our grasp,

622
01:26:18,482 --> 01:26:20,049
we cut it down,

623
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,986
we stamp it out,
we spread ourselves atop it

624
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:26,622
and smother it
beneath our bellies,

625
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:29,926
but it comes back.

626
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,164
It does not dally,

627
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:37,367
nor does it wait to
plot or conspire.

628
01:26:37,434 --> 01:26:38,801
Pull it out by
the roots one day

629
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:41,472
and then next,
there it is,

630
01:26:41,538 --> 01:26:43,272
creeping in around
the edges.

631
01:26:46,109 --> 01:26:48,711
Whilst we're off
looking for red,

632
01:26:48,778 --> 01:26:50,713
in comes green.

633
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,885
Red is the color
of lust,

634
01:26:55,952 --> 01:26:59,122
but green is what
lust leaves behind,

635
01:27:00,491 --> 01:27:01,991
in heart,

636
01:27:03,626 --> 01:27:05,094
in womb.

637
01:27:07,797 --> 01:27:10,666
Green is what is left
when ardor fades,

638
01:27:10,733 --> 01:27:15,004
when passion dies,
when we die, too.

639
01:27:22,579 --> 01:27:25,882
When you go,
your footprints will fill with grass.

640
01:27:27,518 --> 01:27:29,419
Moss shall cover
your tombstone,

641
01:27:29,486 --> 01:27:31,087
and as
the sun rises,

642
01:27:31,154 --> 01:27:34,090
green shall
spread over all,

643
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:38,728
in all its shades
and hues.

644
01:27:42,732 --> 01:27:45,569
This verdigris will
overtake your swords

645
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:47,870
and your coins
and your battlements

646
01:27:47,937 --> 01:27:49,105
and, try as
you might,

647
01:27:49,172 --> 01:27:51,841
all you hold dear
will succumb to it.

648
01:27:51,908 --> 01:27:55,244
Your skin,
your bones.

649
01:27:57,581 --> 01:27:59,215
Your virtue.

650
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:16,999
And what do you
hope to gain

651
01:28:17,066 --> 01:28:19,369
from facing
all of this...

652
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:23,005
this hue?

653
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,776
Honor?

654
01:28:27,777 --> 01:28:29,379
Are you asking me?

655
01:28:29,446 --> 01:28:30,713
- No.
- Hmm.

656
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,715
Honor.

657
01:28:32,782 --> 01:28:35,985
That is why a knight
does what he does.

658
01:28:36,052 --> 01:28:38,689
And this is what
you want most in life?

659
01:28:38,754 --> 01:28:40,089
To be a knight.

660
01:28:40,156 --> 01:28:41,458
No, honor.

661
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,494
You are not
very good with questions.

662
01:28:48,831 --> 01:28:53,202
It is part of
the life I want.

663
01:28:53,269 --> 01:28:56,506
And this is all it takes
for that part to be had?

664
01:28:58,207 --> 01:29:01,043
You'll do this one thing,

665
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:04,681
you return home
a changed man,

666
01:29:04,747 --> 01:29:08,050
an honorable man?
Just like that?

667
01:29:09,586 --> 01:29:11,087
Yes.

668
01:29:12,656 --> 01:29:14,023
Hmm.

669
01:29:16,959 --> 01:29:20,796
Oh, I wish
I could see the new you.

670
01:29:22,231 --> 01:29:27,870
But perhaps we will
miss our old friend

671
01:29:27,937 --> 01:29:32,174
and our fun and our games.

672
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:55,592
- My lady...
- Shh.

673
01:30:58,495 --> 01:31:01,263
Why did you not come
to my chambers yesterday?

674
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:05,836
I couldn't.

675
01:31:05,901 --> 01:31:07,371
You couldn't?

676
01:31:08,772 --> 01:31:10,206
No, but...

677
01:31:14,444 --> 01:31:15,911
But you wanted to.

678
01:31:17,781 --> 01:31:19,081
Yes.

679
01:31:20,517 --> 01:31:21,917
And now?

680
01:31:24,153 --> 01:31:26,989
I would that
I could, but...

681
01:31:27,056 --> 01:31:28,759
- But...
- It isn't right.

682
01:31:28,825 --> 01:31:30,259
Hmm.

683
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,562
Isn't right.

684
01:31:33,697 --> 01:31:35,164
No.

685
01:31:39,101 --> 01:31:40,670
Do you
believe in magic?

686
01:31:42,406 --> 01:31:43,540
What?

687
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:47,243
In witchcraft.
Do you believe in it?

688
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:50,246
Yes. I do.

689
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:52,616
It is all around us.

690
01:31:54,818 --> 01:31:56,520
I have a gift
for you.

691
01:32:12,168 --> 01:32:14,003
Where did you
get that?

692
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,873
I made it.

693
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:22,178
There's an enchantment
sewn into its threads.

694
01:32:22,244 --> 01:32:24,748
Wear it and you will
never be struck down.

695
01:32:24,815 --> 01:32:26,215
By what?

696
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:33,088
By man, or spirit,
or any other implements.

697
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,061
I promise,

698
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:41,163
you will not
come to harm...

699
01:32:43,232 --> 01:32:45,435
as long as it is
about your waist.

700
01:32:48,605 --> 01:32:50,039
Do you mean it?

701
01:32:52,208 --> 01:32:54,411
Yes.

702
01:32:56,947 --> 01:33:00,249
You want it? Huh.

703
01:33:02,117 --> 01:33:03,620
Do you want it?

704
01:33:04,688 --> 01:33:06,155
Yes.

705
01:33:08,023 --> 01:33:09,593
Then tell me.

706
01:33:12,696 --> 01:33:13,996
It's okay, tell me.

707
01:33:15,765 --> 01:33:17,299
I want it.

708
01:33:21,136 --> 01:33:22,606
I want it.

709
01:33:23,507 --> 01:33:25,174
I want it.

710
01:33:27,344 --> 01:33:28,979
Good.

711
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:32,248
Then take it.

712
01:33:34,851 --> 01:33:38,287
Go on, take it.
Take it.

713
01:34:00,744 --> 01:34:02,512
You are no knight.

714
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:00,770
Gawain!

715
01:35:03,006 --> 01:35:04,608
Where are you going?

716
01:35:06,576 --> 01:35:08,612
I must make
my appointment.

717
01:35:08,678 --> 01:35:11,113
Oh, on your
own, after all?

718
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,782
What of our game?

719
01:35:12,849 --> 01:35:15,885
I don't want your games,
or your gifts, or your kindness.

720
01:35:15,952 --> 01:35:19,422
Are you certain there is
nothing you wish to give me?

721
01:35:31,668 --> 01:35:34,404
There is something.

722
01:35:41,745 --> 01:35:43,380
There is something.

723
01:35:45,348 --> 01:35:51,153
And I think I can
take it from you.

724
01:36:10,006 --> 01:36:11,541
Unhand me

725
01:36:12,609 --> 01:36:14,544
and let us
go our ways.

726
01:36:19,214 --> 01:36:20,717
Very well.

727
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:22,952
Very well.

728
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,954
Gawain!

729
01:36:27,357 --> 01:36:28,892
I...

730
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:34,764
I caught this poor fellow
in a trap this morning.

731
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:37,834
I was going
to give him to you,

732
01:36:37,901 --> 01:36:41,905
but I suppose we should
leave him to nature.

733
01:36:49,278 --> 01:36:51,881
Farewell,
Sir Gawain.

734
01:36:51,948 --> 01:36:54,249
And happy Christmas!

735
01:36:54,317 --> 01:36:57,821
If you come back by this way
again, we shall be gone!

736
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:45,935
Why do you stop me?

737
01:37:46,002 --> 01:37:48,538
I cannot tarry.

738
01:37:48,605 --> 01:37:52,809
Go that way and
your doom is at hand.

739
01:37:52,876 --> 01:37:57,213
You will find no mercy.
No happy end.

740
01:37:57,279 --> 01:37:59,015
What witchcraft
is this?

741
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:01,384
No witchcraft.

742
01:38:01,451 --> 01:38:05,155
He you seek
is as wild as I,

743
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:07,991
but knows no measure.

744
01:38:08,057 --> 01:38:09,225
I know what I face.

745
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:11,928
If any man truly knew,

746
01:38:11,995 --> 01:38:16,866
he would bear his shame
happily and turn away,

747
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:22,038
head held high,
to end his song as he saw fit.

748
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:26,109
His secret would
be safe with me.

749
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,645
Are you this man?

750
01:38:29,412 --> 01:38:30,780
No.

751
01:38:30,847 --> 01:38:34,918
The spell about your
waist says otherwise.

752
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:40,256
This is just
a dirty rag.

753
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:42,125
Leave it
here, then.

754
01:38:42,192 --> 01:38:43,526
It was a gift.

755
01:38:43,593 --> 01:38:48,498
No need for gifts
where you are headed.

756
01:38:48,565 --> 01:38:51,968
Come, come home.

757
01:38:53,069 --> 01:38:55,104
Come home with me.

758
01:38:58,808 --> 01:39:01,344
I never asked for
your company anyway!

759
01:44:27,737 --> 01:44:29,373
You came.

760
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:34,378
Good sir,
is it Christmas?

761
01:44:35,345 --> 01:44:36,812
Yes.

762
01:44:58,868 --> 01:45:01,003
Do you recall
where you cut me?

763
01:45:02,071 --> 01:45:03,272
I do.

764
01:45:05,274 --> 01:45:08,445
And have you come to see
that blow returned?

765
01:45:14,817 --> 01:45:16,285
I have.

766
01:45:18,721 --> 01:45:20,289
Then kneel,

767
01:45:21,358 --> 01:45:23,460
and we shall complete
our game.

768
01:45:25,462 --> 01:45:27,029
Now?

769
01:45:29,232 --> 01:45:30,500
Aye.

770
01:45:51,355 --> 01:45:55,592
Now, one strike
as good as you gave.

771
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:03,700
Sir, you flinch.

772
01:46:03,766 --> 01:46:05,768
I know.

773
01:46:06,737 --> 01:46:08,004
I know.

774
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:09,406
Did I show
signs of fear

775
01:46:09,473 --> 01:46:11,274
when our positions
were reversed?

776
01:46:12,808 --> 01:46:15,278
I'm not so confident
as thee.

777
01:46:15,345 --> 01:46:17,514
You have had a year
to find courage.

778
01:46:17,581 --> 01:46:20,016
One year or a hundred,
it wouldn't make a difference.

779
01:46:23,687 --> 01:46:25,087
Give me a moment.

780
01:46:38,535 --> 01:46:39,969
Are you ready?

781
01:46:46,842 --> 01:46:48,412
Are you ready?

782
01:46:53,182 --> 01:46:54,351
Yes.

783
01:46:55,885 --> 01:46:58,187
Then I shall
get to hacking.

784
01:46:59,989 --> 01:47:02,024
Wait! Wait.

785
01:47:07,631 --> 01:47:09,599
Is this...

786
01:47:10,801 --> 01:47:12,301
...really all
there is?

787
01:47:13,737 --> 01:47:16,005
Is that...
Is this...

788
01:47:18,775 --> 01:47:20,444
What else ought there be?

789
01:47:50,906 --> 01:47:53,410
No! No.
I'm sorry.

790
01:47:54,778 --> 01:47:56,580
I cannot.
I'm sorry.
