00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,463
<i>Okay, here we go.
I think it's all set.</i>

3
00:00:34,547 --> 00:00:37,838
<i>- Ah, yes! Okay.
- Did you get it?</i>

4
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,005
- <i>Here.
- You like it?</i>

5
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,808
- <i>Love it!
- Want me to do it?</i>

6
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:43,172
<i>Teddy,
you like your new fire truck?</i>

7
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,797
<i>It's just like Daddy's.</i>

8
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:46,797
<i>Ted. Teddy!</i>

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,600
<i>Look at the camera.
Look and say, "Hi, Mom."</i>

10
00:00:48,672 --> 00:00:50,005
- <i>Hi!
- Hi, Mommy.</i>

11
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:51,838
<i>Well, look at her and say it.</i>

12
00:00:51,922 --> 00:00:54,547
<i>- Hi, Mommy!
- Good job.</i>

13
00:00:55,838 --> 00:01:00,588
- <i>Merry Christmas 2007.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

14
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,755
<i>- Oh, be careful, honey.
- Get the camera.</i>

15
00:01:03,838 --> 00:01:05,713
<i>Teddy. Teddy, come here.</i>

16
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:08,755
<i>Look at this, huh! It's your sister.</i>

17
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:10,422
<i>Katie Cat!</i>

18
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:14,005
<i>Katie Cat! That's good, dude.
Gimme some.</i>

19
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:18,005
<i>Merry Christmas 2008!
Santa got Teddy a bike!</i>

20
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:19,797
<i>Santa got Teddy a bike!</i>

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,588
<i>- All right, wave to Mom. Say "Hi, Mom."
- Hi, Mom!</i>

22
00:01:22,672 --> 00:01:24,088
<i>Say, "Thank you, Santa."</i>

23
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,172
<i>- Thank you, Santa.
- Thank you, Santa.</i>

24
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:29,338
<i>It's Christmas 2011! Whoo!
What did we get?</i>

25
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,255
<i>- You guys, guys!
- My turn!</i>

26
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:34,005
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing, you guys?</i>

27
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:35,088
<i>Come on!</i>

28
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,713
<i>All right? What... What do we do? We...</i>

29
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,422
<i>Hug it out.</i>

30
00:01:39,505 --> 00:01:41,755
- <i>Hey, guys!
- Hey, come here. Look!</i>

31
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:46,172
<i>Okay, so most people don't know this,
but reindeer love candy canes. Watch.</i>

32
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:47,172
<i>Oh.</i>

33
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:48,922
- <i>Hi.
- Is this true, honey?</i>

34
00:01:49,005 --> 00:01:50,925
<i>- I want a reindeer!
- You want a reindeer?</i>

35
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:53,547
<i>Oh, really?
Where are we gonna keep this reindeer?</i>

36
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,606
<i>- How about a fish? You want a fish?
- No, let's go with the reindeer.</i>

37
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,255
- <i>Have two fish?
- No.</i>

38
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:00,588
- <i>Look, look! She's eating it!
- So cool!</i>

39
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:01,981
- <i>Look at that!
- Yay!</i>

40
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:07,963
<i>Teddy is about to open his present
from Daddy.</i>

41
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:11,922
<i>- Mommy doesn't really approve, okay.
- This is a big one!</i>

42
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:17,338
<i>- So cool. A knife.
- What's it say?</i>

43
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:20,755
<i>- "A Pierce always sees it through."
- That's right.</i>

44
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:22,380
<i>- Gosh.
- It fits you.</i>

45
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:25,505
<i>- Everyone get together.
- A picture. All right, guys.</i>

46
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,308
- <i>Everybody smile!
- What do we say?</i>

47
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,880
<i>- We say...
- Thank you, Aunt Peggy!</i>

48
00:02:30,963 --> 00:02:32,005
<i>You look great.</i>

49
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:35,380
<i>- Hat!
- Christmas 2017!</i>

50
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:36,838
<i>Come here, baby.</i>

51
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:39,922
- <i>Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

52
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:42,797
<i>- Come here.
- Come on.</i>

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,588
I miss you, Daddy.

54
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,130
<i>- Hi!
- Hi!</i>

55
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:48,922
<i>Happy snowman!</i>

56
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,963
<i>- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.</i>

57
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,380
<i>Dear Santa, this is Kate Pierce.</i>

58
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,963
<i>Eighteen Bridgton Road,
Lowell, Massachusetts.</i>

59
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:17,713
<i>Just wanted to say
that I've been really good this year.</i>

60
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,213
I know I haven't been doing too well
in school,

61
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:22,922
especially since I got a D minus
in Spanish.

62
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,047
<i>I have a really hard time with languages.</i>

63
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,338
<i>But I promise to get my grades up
in the new year.</i>

64
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,797
I help out Mom a lot.

65
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:30,922
She has to work
at the hospital most nights,

66
00:03:31,005 --> 00:03:33,130
so I start dinner three,
four times a week,

67
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,172
do the dishes, and take out the trash.

68
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:37,755
<i>And I try not to get
into too much trouble.</i>

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,672
<i>I do say bad words every now and then,</i>

70
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:42,715
<i>but that's only when my brother, Teddy,
makes fun of me and I lose my sh...</i>

71
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,380
<i>I mean, my temper.</i>

72
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:47,672
Anyway, Santa,
I'm not asking for much this Christmas.

73
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,713
Just a Bones Brigade skateboard.

74
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,047
You know, the red one
with the skeleton on it?

75
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:54,338
My brother, Teddy,
won't even let me touch his.

76
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,588
He says skateboards aren't for girls.

77
00:03:56,797 --> 00:03:59,255
I wouldn't waste my time
getting him any presents.

78
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:00,713
He doesn't deserve anything.

79
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:04,255
He's turning into a real loser...
Ow! Teddy, what the hell?

80
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:05,713
Oh, sorry! I meant "heck."

81
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:08,148
- Talking smack about me?
- Let go! You're gonna break it!

82
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:10,047
Who cares?
This camera's like 20 years old.

83
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,023
If it's good enough for Dad,
it's good enough for me.

84
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:13,505
Now, give it back!

85
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,422
I can't believe you're still making
video letters to Santa.

86
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,505
Why?

87
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:19,922
- You're ten years old! Almost 11!
- So?

88
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,630
Oh,
you really have no clue, do you?

89
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,547
What are you talking about?

90
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,880
Kate.

91
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:31,088
There is no...

92
00:04:32,172 --> 00:04:33,213
No what?

93
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:38,963
No...

94
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,463
chance that he's gonna watch a video.

95
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,672
He only reads handwritten letters sent
in the mail.

96
00:04:46,047 --> 00:04:47,463
Where are you going?

97
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,088
I gotta meet my friends.

98
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:50,922
Then I'm coming with.

99
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:54,922
- What?
- You can't leave me alone in the house.

100
00:04:55,005 --> 00:04:56,047
I'm coming with you.

101
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:01,630
No, you're not.

102
00:05:01,713 --> 00:05:03,880
- My fish!
- Hope they're hungry.

103
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,213
Don't worry, guys!
Everything's gonna be okay!

104
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,297
<i>All right, come on.
Right this way.</i>

105
00:05:52,088 --> 00:05:53,380
Come on, let's go.

106
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,713
<i>Dude, hurry up.</i>

107
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:01,505
Teddy, do your thing.

108
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,255
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

109
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,130
- <i>Not too bad, man.
- Let's get outta here.</i>

110
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:19,547
No freaking way.

111
00:06:31,422 --> 00:06:33,380
You have a good time with your friends?

112
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,588
Get outta my room.
You're not allowed in here.

113
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,880
And you're not allowed to steal cars
from the deli parking lot.

114
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,255
What?

115
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:44,255
- I didn't steal a car.
- I saw the whole thing.

116
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Can't prove it.

117
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:48,797
Wanna bet?

118
00:06:50,297 --> 00:06:51,297
Give me that.

119
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,630
When Mom sees this, she's gonna freak out!

120
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:55,793
She's so sick of your crap,

121
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,630
I bet she turns you in
to the cops herself!

122
00:06:57,713 --> 00:06:59,380
Gimme that tape, you little creep!

123
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,380
Oh, you're so dead!

124
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,338
And you're so busted!

125
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:05,463
- Gimme that now! Come on!
- No!

126
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:07,380
Gimme it!

127
00:07:07,463 --> 00:07:10,922
- You're such a jerk!
- Come on!

128
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,755
It's mine! Give it back!

129
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:17,463
- Ow! Stop! It's mine!
- Come on, stop being such a baby!

130
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,588
- Stop!
- What the hell is going on?

131
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,213
Is this what happens when I leave?

132
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,588
- She started it.
- Did not!

133
00:07:24,672 --> 00:07:27,630
He did something really horrible,
and I have proof!

134
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,713
Oh, jeez...

135
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:30,672
What did he do now?

136
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:35,630
Come on, Kate! I'm waiting!

137
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,380
What did Teddy do?

138
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:44,255
He shoved me against the wall,
into this picture.

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,838
You know what I want for Christmas?

140
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,172
I want for the two of you to get along.

141
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:06,672
You're her older brother.
I expect more from you.

142
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,088
Teddy, please put the tree back up.

143
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:13,814
And put the lights on, while you're at it.
I've only been asking you all week!

144
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:16,463
Come on, you guys!
Dad would've had this place looking...

145
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:25,338
Kate, help me unload the groceries.

146
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:55,505
This does not look
like a Christmas tree. It looks like...

147
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:57,672
I think it looks great.

148
00:08:57,963 --> 00:09:01,838
Whoa, whoa! You want some cookie
with those sprinkles? Golly!

149
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:03,338
Dad likes sprinkles.

150
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,422
Sorry. Sometimes I forget.

151
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:12,463
- I don't mean to.
- That's okay, honey.

152
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:16,047
I like it.

153
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,547
- Thanks.
- I think they should all be like that.

154
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:22,297
Hi, Angela.

155
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,380
Seriously?

156
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,588
Isn't there someone else that can...

157
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:29,213
Oh, no. That's terrible.

158
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:32,922
Yeah, no, of course.
I'll... I'll be right there.

159
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,088
Okay, bye.

160
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,130
You gotta work tonight?

161
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,547
- I don't want to.
- But it's Christmas Eve!

162
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,047
Well, even more reason for me
to be at the hospital, honey.

163
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,338
Some people have no one else
to take care of them.

164
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,380
But there's still so much to do.

165
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,672
We have to hang the stockings
and make the eggnog!

166
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,088
- It just won't be Christmas without it!
- Oh, honey.

167
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:56,880
There is more to Christmas
than all that stuff.

168
00:09:57,255 --> 00:09:59,505
I'm gonna pretend
like I didn't hear that, Mom.

169
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:05,338
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Just out.

170
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,213
- Where?
- Me and my friends are going caroling.

171
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:14,130
You haven't been caroling since you were
in kindergarten, and you hated it.

172
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,338
Just wanna spread
a little Christmas cheer.

173
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,172
More like Christmas beer.

174
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:22,380
Okay, well, you can't go,
'cause I need to work.

175
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:23,297
Seriously?

176
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,797
- Yeah.
- It's Christmas Eve.

177
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,588
Which is why you're gonna stay home
with your sister.

178
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:29,630
- Come on, Mom. I...
- No.

179
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,588
You are not to leave this house,
young man!

180
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,880
You leave her alone again,
and you are grounded!

181
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:35,255
Until February.

182
00:10:35,755 --> 00:10:37,213
You wanna spread some cheer?

183
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:38,297
Decorate the tree.

184
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,130
Whatever.

185
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:42,880
Okay.

186
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:46,338
Take the cookies out
in 20 minutes, all right?

187
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:49,297
And don't stay up too late. And no soda!

188
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,963
And listen, absolutely no junk food, okay?

189
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:54,922
- You hear me? Gotcha!
- Mom.

190
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,213
Okay.

191
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,963
See you guys tomorrow, bright and early.

192
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,797
I love you.

193
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,338
- I love you, too.
- Merry Christmas.

194
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:06,880
Merry Christmas.

195
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,255
Wanna watch a movie? Mom's gone,
so it can be PG-13 or maybe even R!

196
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:22,713
- I'm gonna go to my room.
- But it's Christmas Eve!

197
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,380
Let's do something together.

198
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:25,463
Come on, Teddy Bear.

199
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,630
I told you to stop calling me that.

200
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,797
You used to laugh
when I called you Teddy Bear,

201
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,172
and I was your Katie Cat.

202
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:35,713
But ever since Dad died...

203
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:36,922
I mean...

204
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,213
all you wanna do is hang out
with your wannabe gangster friends.

205
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:45,255
You know... at least they're fun.

206
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,255
They're not boring slugs like you.

207
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:59,797
<i>- Mm, cookies.
- No! You've had enough, mister!</i>

208
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,360
<i>Is there any chance I can open
a Christmas present early?</i>

209
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,630
<i>No,
we have way too much to do.</i>

210
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:06,047
<i>And...</i>

211
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,088
<i>- What is this? What is this?
- What are you doing?</i>

212
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:11,172
<i>This looks like mistletoe.</i>

213
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:12,922
<i>- I know.
- I think I like it.</i>

214
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,797
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

215
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,005
<i>Say "Merry Christmas."</i>

216
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:19,297
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

217
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:23,213
<i>Where are you going?
Wait. Honey...</i>

218
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:27,255
<i>You're gonna wake up the kids!</i>

219
00:12:30,422 --> 00:12:31,463
<i>Seriously?</i>

220
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,838
Teddy, get down here!
You've gotta see this!

221
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,630
You're not gonna believe it!

222
00:13:05,547 --> 00:13:08,380
- You know who that looks like.
- Aunt Peggy.

223
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,922
No way. That person isn't wearing
an ugly Christmas sweater.

224
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:12,880
And besides,

225
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,630
Aunt Peggy's never here on Christmas Eve.
And if she was,

226
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:18,213
why would Mom and Dad leave her alone
in the living room

227
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,588
in the dark?

228
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:20,672
Maybe it was a burglar.

229
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,630
Burglars take things.

230
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:24,255
Whoever it was

231
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:28,130
would've had to been standing flat up
against the wall like this, next to the...

232
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,880
Oh, my gosh! The fireplace!
I just got goosebumps!

233
00:13:31,713 --> 00:13:32,713
Chill out.

234
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:34,547
Just let me think.

235
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,838
- Come on, Teddy. You know it's him.
- Kate...

236
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:38,838
Hey, we should make a video!

237
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,547
- A video?
- Yeah!

238
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,463
Tonight!

239
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:44,797
Maybe we can get a shot
of the whole Santa Claus,

240
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,338
and not just his hand!

241
00:13:46,797 --> 00:13:48,755
You don't think anyone's thought
of that before?

242
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,380
Catching Santa in the act?

243
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:56,547
Yeah, but have you ever heard of anyone
actually pulling it off?

244
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,547
No! They probably don't think
it's possible. But it is!

245
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,797
This is proof!

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,547
A video showing exactly how he does it.
It's gonna get a gazillion hits.

247
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,630
No way.

248
00:14:05,713 --> 00:14:08,338
Please? Mom always says
we should be helping each other out.

249
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,102
I don't think this is
what she had in mind.

250
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,505
Look! I'll give you back the tape of you
in the car.

251
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:19,047
Okay. Deal.

252
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,588
And you can never say anything
to Mom about it.

253
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:29,463
I swear.

254
00:14:58,755 --> 00:14:59,755
What are you doing?

255
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:02,255
I saw it on <i>Ghost Adventurers.</i>

256
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:05,505
Lamest Christmas ever.

257
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,755
- Hey! Mom said no junk food!
- Yeah, well, we gotta stay up somehow.

258
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:26,713
Plus...

259
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:30,505
sometimes, you gotta break the rules
for the greater good.

260
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,630
Can't even remember the last time
we did anything together, Teddy.

261
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:38,380
Just the two of us!
Pulling an all-nighter!

262
00:15:39,088 --> 00:15:40,547
How awesome is this?

263
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:43,713
Whatever.

264
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,463
So good. So good.

265
00:15:49,838 --> 00:15:51,380
Slow down, dude.

266
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:41,880
Oh my!

267
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,213
Teddy! Teddy! Teddy!

268
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:46,755
What?

269
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,422
He's here!

270
00:16:49,172 --> 00:16:51,088
- Who?
- Santa!

271
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,338
He's gone!

272
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:53,838
You're kidding, right?

273
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,588
- What the...
- He's on the roof, let's go!

274
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,463
- He's at the back of the house!
- Get your coat!

275
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:07,713
<i>Be careful!</i>

276
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:11,422
<i>I don't see him!</i>

277
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,755
<i>Whoa! Gimme the camera!</i>

278
00:17:14,797 --> 00:17:16,047
<i>What?</i>

279
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,630
<i>Did you see that?
It's Santa Claus!</i>

280
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:20,963
<i>Come on!</i>

281
00:17:21,505 --> 00:17:23,463
<i>We'll get a better view from the alley!</i>

282
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:25,630
- <i>Wait up!
- Hurry!</i>

283
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,297
<i>Slow down! Wait!</i>

284
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:33,880
What?

285
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,422
Tell me you're getting this.

286
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:47,130
Oh, yeah, right.

287
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,422
Whoa!

288
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:03,505
It's more beautiful than I ever imagined.

289
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:12,338
Kate, wait!

290
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:16,547
Come back!

291
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,463
What are you doing?

292
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:21,880
Do you realize how big of a deal this is?
I need to get a closer look.

293
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:24,672
- Get down.
- No way. Hand me the camera.

294
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:27,255
Fine.

295
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:33,130
Be careful. You break your neck,
and Mom will kill me.

296
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,130
Kate... what are you...

297
00:18:46,463 --> 00:18:47,463
No, stop!

298
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,005
You gotta be kidding me!

299
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,088
- Teddy!
- Are you crazy?

300
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:07,797
Why'd you do that?

301
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,755
I wanted to get a closer look
at the sleigh.

302
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:15,297
Duck!

303
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:21,713
- Did he see us?
- I don't think so.

304
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:23,547
We got enough footage.
Let's get outta here.

305
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,005
- Why don't we just stay here?
- Stay here? In the sleigh?

306
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:29,880
Yeah! How many kids get to ride with Santa
in his sleigh on Christmas Eve?

307
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,755
No, okay...

308
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,922
On, Cupid! On, Comet!

309
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:29,172
It's freezing.

310
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,330
Hang in there.
He's gonna go back down again.

311
00:20:33,172 --> 00:20:35,422
Maybe Santa has a blanket?

312
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:36,630
I'll look.

313
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,213
Santa?

314
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,588
Help me, Teddy!

315
00:21:01,255 --> 00:21:02,713
Kate! Help!

316
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,213
Who?

317
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:15,880
- Kate!
- Help me!

318
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:17,255
Grab my hand!

319
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:20,463
- Reach!
- I'm trying!

320
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:22,380
Teddy!

321
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:25,630
You got this, Kate!

322
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:54,380
Ah!

323
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,838
Whoa.

324
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,463
Hold on to your sister!

325
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,130
Brace yourselves!

326
00:23:03,797 --> 00:23:04,797
Teddy?

327
00:23:05,797 --> 00:23:07,797
Teddy? Teddy?

328
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,588
Are you okay?

329
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,005
Where's the camera?

330
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,297
Still works.

331
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,630
Where are we?

332
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:27,713
- Teddy...
- I could have swore I saw Paris!

333
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:30,797
- Uh, Teddy?
- That plane almost killed us!

334
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:33,172
- Teddy?
- I was in the sky!

335
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:34,338
- Teddy!
- What?

336
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:39,922
Santa Claus?

337
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,047
Live and in person.

338
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,672
One night only.

339
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:47,088
You two okay?

340
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:48,505
Yeah.

341
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:51,880
You look so... um, different.

342
00:23:52,088 --> 00:23:54,172
Why? Because I'm not a big fat slob?

343
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:56,338
No, no. I... I didn't mean it that way.

344
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:58,880
Ah, that's okay, Kate.
I guess it's understandable.

345
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:02,088
I mean, who can eat millions of cookies
in one night and not get fat, right?

346
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:03,838
Well, I can.

347
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,005
Can you go, "Ho ho ho"?

348
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:09,005
I don't go, "Ho ho ho." That's a myth.

349
00:24:09,338 --> 00:24:10,547
Fake news.

350
00:24:11,255 --> 00:24:12,255
Sorry.

351
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,338
Oh no. Oh...

352
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:19,422
You two have really messed things up.

353
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:21,088
You were supposed to be asleep.

354
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:23,005
- It was all her idea!
- Hey!

355
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:24,088
- It was!
- Wait.

356
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,062
What did you do with my sack of presents?

357
00:24:27,713 --> 00:24:29,297
It flew off the sleigh.

358
00:24:29,838 --> 00:24:30,922
Oh, not good.

359
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,380
Not good at all.

360
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:41,797
First star's there...

361
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,047
Second star's there.

362
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:47,213
We came back over Moscow and...

363
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:49,255
and over Paris,

364
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:50,922
New York,

365
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:53,047
Boston... Oh!

366
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,547
Reindeer must've broken off
somewhere over Lakeshore Drive.

367
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,255
Lakeshore Drive?

368
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:00,130
We're in Chicago, young lady.

369
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:01,130
Chicago?

370
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:03,922
That means we traveled
thousands of miles in, like, 30 seconds.

371
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,880
- Epic!
- You mean epic disaster.

372
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:10,672
If I'm not up and running
in the next couple of hours,

373
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:13,088
half the continent's
not gonna get presents, and that,

374
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,672
well, that can never happen.

375
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:18,172
Uh, so a few brats don't get presents.
It's not the end of the world.

376
00:25:21,213 --> 00:25:26,172
That's just the kinda lame garbage
I'd expect from a Lost Believer.

377
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,922
You listen to me, Teddy Pierce.

378
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:31,005
Tonight,

379
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:35,130
young boys and girls
all over the globe are waiting, hoping,

380
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:37,797
expecting Santa Claus to arrive.

381
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:39,297
And if I don't...

382
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,547
Well, you don't wanna know what happened
the last time I couldn't make my rounds.

383
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:46,630
Yes, we do. Tell us.

384
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,630
<i>You've heard of the Dark Ages?</i>

385
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:53,963
<i>Read about all those wars in school?</i>

386
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,713
Yeah, sure, but...

387
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,130
Wait, those happened
because you missed Christmas?

388
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,005
Christmas spirit is more powerful
than you could ever imagine.

389
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,047
People need Christmas to remind themselves
of how good they can be!

390
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:10,797
<i>Without it, well, Christmas simply...</i>

391
00:26:11,672 --> 00:26:13,047
<i>must endure!</i>

392
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:16,172
All right,
I need to round up the reindeer,

393
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,672
find my sack of presents,

394
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:19,088
call the elves, and maybe,

395
00:26:19,172 --> 00:26:22,963
just maybe, I can still save Christmas.

396
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,213
All right...

397
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,620
Ooh.

398
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,213
What is that?

399
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,547
Tracking device for the sack.

400
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:37,130
The closer you get, the faster it chimes.

401
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,588
- It's pretty cool.
- Yeah, it is.

402
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:41,672
That's good.

403
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:44,880
At least it's not that far away.

404
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,297
Uh...

405
00:26:49,713 --> 00:26:50,922
Well...

406
00:26:51,713 --> 00:26:52,713
bye.

407
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,005
Ow!

408
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:57,547
Santa, are you okay?

409
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,672
Oh no!

410
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:01,588
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

411
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:02,797
My hat!

412
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:04,130
My hat's gone!

413
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:05,297
Do you want mine?

414
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,047
Oh, that... that won't help.
Your hat's not magic.

415
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,547
Magic?

416
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,672
Well, how do you think
I can turn into coal dust

417
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,838
and leap from rooftop to rooftop?

418
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,422
Pilates?

419
00:27:16,255 --> 00:27:17,255
My hat!

420
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:21,422
I can't believe this! She told me,

421
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:23,713
"You should always bring a spare, Nick!"

422
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:27,755
Well...

423
00:27:27,838 --> 00:27:30,797
I guess I'm gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

424
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:32,880
On foot.

425
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:34,338
Santa, just let us help you!

426
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:35,338
Oh, no, no, no.

427
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:38,422
I think you've done quite enough damage
already, don't you?

428
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:41,547
No, you just go on back to your house
and get some sleep.

429
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,172
No need to wake up early.

430
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:45,297
There won't be any presents.

431
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:50,463
You two are on the naughty list for life.

432
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:57,630
We can't just stay here! Santa needs us!

433
00:27:57,963 --> 00:27:59,547
I don't know. He seems pretty mad.

434
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,189
- We should just head home.
- Home?

435
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,047
We're, like, a thousand miles away!

436
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:06,463
Teddy, you heard him.
We're on the naughty list for life!

437
00:28:07,172 --> 00:28:08,672
We've ruined Christmas!

438
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:11,963
I mean, that's, like, the worst possible
thing a kid could ever do!

439
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:14,422
Do you really wanna tell your kids
that you were that guy?

440
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:18,463
The person responsible
for the Christmas Meltdown of 2018?

441
00:28:18,547 --> 00:28:21,213
Okay, fine!

442
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:24,505
Wait, Santa!

443
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:26,005
We just wanna help!

444
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:28,380
Ah, well, I can't do anything to stop you.

445
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,338
You better watch out, you better not pout,
and you better not cry.

446
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,172
I don't have time
for any more of your shenanigans.

447
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:44,088
Ah, perfect.

448
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:58,047
Uh, I don't think I'm supposed to be
in here.

449
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,380
Just stay next to me,
but <i>I'll </i>do the talking.

450
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:04,047
Can I help you?

451
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:05,797
Wendy!

452
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:09,088
- How do you know my name?
- You got so big!

453
00:29:09,422 --> 00:29:10,422
Excuse me?

454
00:29:10,838 --> 00:29:12,963
Ah, you know what I mean. Grown-up big!

455
00:29:13,255 --> 00:29:14,975
Now,
do you remember that letter you sent me

456
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,047
about dreaming
of being a fashion designer?

457
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,315
She used to always ask for sewing kits,

458
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,838
little toy sewing machines.

459
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:25,130
I think it was 2009 when you made
all the stockings by yourself.

460
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:26,380
I...

461
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:28,088
Yeah, I think so.

462
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:31,547
Well, I'm sorry the fashion designer thing
didn't quite pan out.

463
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:34,338
Yeah, I wanted to go to Parsons
and live in New York,

464
00:29:34,463 --> 00:29:36,463
but I couldn't afford the tuition.

465
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Hmm...

466
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,490
- No.
- Wait, what is this?

467
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:42,355
Is this some kind of reality show?
How do you know all that stuff?

468
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:43,547
Kate, come on.

469
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,880
Did you talk to my mom?

470
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:47,588
Oh, no, no, no.
I certainly wouldn't ruin the surprise

471
00:29:47,672 --> 00:29:49,672
of that beautiful scarf
you made for your mom.

472
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:52,767
Wendy, we've got a big problem.

473
00:29:52,797 --> 00:29:54,463
We need a ride into the city.

474
00:29:54,547 --> 00:29:57,172
Oh, I don't have a car.
Can you call an Uber?

475
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:58,630
Don't have an account.

476
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,255
Um, a taxi?

477
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,130
Oh, you guys got any cash on you?

478
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,297
No.

479
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,380
Ah, right.

480
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,963
You think I can pay the driver...
with these?

481
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:11,005
Santa! Sorry.

482
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:14,005
You know what? Um...
Here, take my tips.

483
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:16,213
Um, although I don't think
it's enough to cover

484
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:17,937
- a cab ride...
- That's very kind of you,

485
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:19,803
but I'm sure somebody
in here will help us out.

486
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,963
Uh, sorry for the intrusion, folks.

487
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:29,963
- I'm...
- Santa Claus.

488
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,338
- The <i>real</i> Santa Claus!
- Yeah, that's okay, Kate.

489
00:30:32,422 --> 00:30:35,255
- Not just one of those phony mall ones.
- I've got this.

490
00:30:35,338 --> 00:30:37,172
You don't look like Santa Claus.

491
00:30:41,713 --> 00:30:45,255
Yeah, well,
billboards add 80 pounds, Freddie.

492
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,505
As I was saying,

493
00:30:48,005 --> 00:30:50,672
we've got ourselves
an emergency situation here.

494
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:52,755
Christmas is in trouble.

495
00:30:53,213 --> 00:30:54,922
And if you all want presents
under the tree

496
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:57,088
and in your stockings in the morning,

497
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:58,630
then I need your help.

498
00:30:59,422 --> 00:31:00,422
So...

499
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:03,922
who here can give us a ride into the city
so I can find my reindeer?

500
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,880
Uh, Min-Jun.

501
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,047
Can you help?

502
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:17,213
I'm sorry, we can't help.

503
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,755
Vijay! Beena!

504
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,220
You guys have a car
you can lend me?

505
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:24,755
Please leave us alone.

506
00:31:25,005 --> 00:31:26,005
Hmm.

507
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:27,963
And I speak English, you moron.

508
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,755
Hope you like coal.

509
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:34,088
Larry and Sheila Bumperton.

510
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:36,047
Well...

511
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,047
Hey, Larry! Sheila.

512
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:41,880
Larry, you drove your Porsche
here tonight, didn't you?

513
00:31:42,255 --> 00:31:45,297
- Yeah.
- How would you like to trade that Porsche

514
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,130
for a mint condition 1952...

515
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:50,338
...Mickey Mantle rookie card?

516
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,213
I know you've always wanted one.

517
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:56,088
- Is this thing real?
- Oh, yes.

518
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,088
- It's a deal. It's a deal.
- I thought so.

519
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,255
- It's at the valet.
- No, it's not!

520
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:04,713
You're not trading our Porsche
for a baseball card, Larry!

521
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,963
- Know what that is worth?
- What it's worth? Nothing!

522
00:32:07,047 --> 00:32:09,130
That's what it's worth!

523
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:10,463
Get outta here, you bum!

524
00:32:10,547 --> 00:32:12,005
Merry Christmas.

525
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:15,630
There is a maniac dressed
in a weird Santa costume

526
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:16,797
harassing the customers.

527
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,380
He's got two kids with him.
It could be an AMBER Alert situation.

528
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,423
- We gotta get out of here.
- Jeff! I know

529
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:24,606
- you've had a hard time believ...
- Okay, sorry, folks!

530
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,547
- Grandpa's a little...
- What are you doing?

531
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,672
- What has gotten into you?
- Okay, Santa, let's go!

532
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:31,963
Hey! You three! Out!

533
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,630
Well, well, well...

534
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:37,380
if it isn't Charlie Plummer!

535
00:32:38,005 --> 00:32:40,755
Now, old Charlie here is
in the Naughty List Hall of Fame!

536
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:44,135
Ah, you just got outta the joint again,
what, about a month ago, Charlie?

537
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,213
Mm-hmm.

538
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,172
Armed robbery...

539
00:32:47,255 --> 00:32:49,380
money laundering, grand theft auto.

540
00:32:49,588 --> 00:32:50,672
You know what, Charlie?

541
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:53,547
I don't think your parole officer
would be too happy

542
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,880
if he knew you'd stolen
that red Dodge Challenger

543
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:57,380
a couple of days ago, do you?

544
00:32:57,797 --> 00:33:01,213
Yeah, well, what my parole officer
doesn't know won't hurt him.

545
00:33:01,838 --> 00:33:04,838
You, on the other hand,
might not be so lucky!

546
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,130
No judgments!

547
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:09,047
After all, my friend Teddy here
is headed down the same path.

548
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,770
I mean, he's still a little young, but...

549
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,963
you keep going, couple years,
this could be you.

550
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:16,172
Prison tattoos and slinging tequila shots!

551
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:18,630
- Okay, that's it!
- All right, out! Out, out, out, out!

552
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:19,963
Bye, Wendy!

553
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:21,172
Good luck!

554
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:22,505
Let's go! Okay, hold the doors!

555
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:29,005
Oh!

556
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,130
Be careful.

557
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,630
Sweet dreams, Charlie.

558
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:39,380
Oh no!
Christmas spirit's already down 35%.

559
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:41,630
We need to get things back on track.

560
00:33:41,713 --> 00:33:42,880
- Hold on.
- What?

561
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:44,838
Shh.

562
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:50,047
<i>You better run!</i>

563
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,880
<i>She's our friend and she's crazy!</i>

564
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:57,047
<i>If you come back here, she'll kill you!
You hear me? She'll kill you...</i>

565
00:33:58,463 --> 00:33:59,463
Oh.

566
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
Ah...

567
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,963
No, no, no, no. Teddy, Teddy,
I don't think this is such a good idea.

568
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:06,255
Neither do I.

569
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,422
Oh, come on!
Do you wanna save Christmas?

570
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,005
Well, not by stealing a car.

571
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,338
Uh, that kinda undermines

572
00:34:11,422 --> 00:34:13,422
the whole naughty or nice concept,
don't you think?

573
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:15,648
Don't you break into, like,
a billion homes every year?

574
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:19,297
- I mean, technically, that's illegal, too.
- Fair point.

575
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,547
And, plus, it's not just any car.

576
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:22,922
It's this car.

577
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:25,838
Oh...

578
00:34:26,755 --> 00:34:29,130
I mean, we're not even breaking the law
because...

579
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:30,963
you know, the car's already stolen.

580
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:33,880
- And when we're finished, we'll just...
- Turn it in to the police.

581
00:34:33,963 --> 00:34:35,630
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

582
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:40,422
All right, now, slow down.
Just be cool. Walk regular. Regular.

583
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:42,130
Hey, hey, slow down! Slow down!

584
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,213
You're not even old enough to drive!

585
00:34:45,463 --> 00:34:47,463
- Hey!
- Oh, no time to argue! Look!

586
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:48,838
That's my car!

587
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,963
- No, it's not! You stole it!
- Get in, get in!

588
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,713
No, stop! Stop!

589
00:34:57,588 --> 00:34:59,088
That's my car!

590
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:06,880
Hey, don't worry, Charlie.
I just reported it stolen.

591
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,797
You did what?

592
00:35:18,713 --> 00:35:19,547
How we doing?

593
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,350
No one's following us,
so you can slow down.

594
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,102
Oh, come on, I'm not even going that fast!

595
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:25,338
Here we go...

596
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,213
All right, now we're getting somewhere.

597
00:35:29,547 --> 00:35:31,797
Uh, Santa,
you know that stuff's junk, right?

598
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,797
Yeah, well, Katie Cat, one man's junk...

599
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:37,880
is Santa's treasure.

600
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:39,963
Teddy, I'm gonna need your knife.

601
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,047
Hmm.

602
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,880
Uh, Santa,
that's not how you work the radio.

603
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:58,588
<i>- ...disturbance...</i>
- Cool!

604
00:35:58,672 --> 00:36:02,047
<i>on the corner of Naperville and Roslyn.
Car 476 responding.</i>

605
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:06,088
- How did you just...
- I am the greatest toymaker on Earth.

606
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:09,047
<i>All units,
we have a reported grand theft auto.</i>

607
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,588
<i>A 2014 red Dodge Challenger, license plate
six, Bravo, Lima, seven, two, four.</i>

608
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,130
<i>Stolen by two kids
and an extremely large man.</i>

609
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,755
A guy goes to the gym every day,

610
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,463
stays away from sugar and carbs,
what difference does it make? Oh man.

611
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,307
<i>Attention,
we have sightings</i>

612
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,713
<i>of what appear to be...</i>

613
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:28,963
<i>reindeer...
running down Michigan Avenue...</i>

614
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:31,064
- Just what we're looking for.
<i>- Not a joke.</i>

615
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,255
<i>I have a team of reindeer headed
southbound on Michigan Avenue,</i>

616
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:35,255
<i>toward Water Tower.</i>

617
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:37,005
They're not that far away.

618
00:36:37,088 --> 00:36:40,172
- That way! Go!
- The, uh... The car can't fly, Santa.

619
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:45,255
Right, habit. Okay, left on State,
right on Erie, left on Michigan.

620
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:47,047
How do you know so much about Chicago?

621
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,838
I know every street in the world, kid.

622
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:50,882
Teddy, you think
we could pick it up a little bit?

623
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:53,172
Put your seat belt on.

624
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,505
State Street, go!

625
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:06,797
Good move, Teddy.

626
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,797
All right.

627
00:37:23,547 --> 00:37:25,130
Slow down, Teddy.

628
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:28,088
See if we can find my reindeer.

629
00:37:36,213 --> 00:37:37,213
Donner!

630
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,005
Comet!

631
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,755
Blitzen!

632
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,172
Dasher!

633
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:49,088
<i>You guys! There...
There they are!</i>

634
00:37:49,172 --> 00:37:50,005
Where?

635
00:37:50,088 --> 00:37:53,005
Back down that street!
Turn around, Teddy! Turn around!

636
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,672
Teddy, stop the car!

637
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,255
Prancer! Dancer! Get back here!

638
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:11,547
Comet! Cupid! Donner!

639
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,463
Did I say Dasher?
I always forget Vixen. Vixen!

640
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:15,963
Guys! Guys!

641
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,005
All right. Kate, come here.

642
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,297
Yeah?

643
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,380
You go after the reindeer.

644
00:38:23,463 --> 00:38:25,630
- Teddy and I are gonna buy you some time.
- What?

645
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,433
We can't leave my sister
all alone out here.

646
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:28,672
Teddy, I can handle it.

647
00:38:28,755 --> 00:38:31,338
- But I think...
- She said she can handle it, Teddy.

648
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,797
I've always believed in you, Kate.

649
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,172
I've always believed in you.

650
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:41,255
Unlike some people.

651
00:38:42,047 --> 00:38:43,547
Guys, we better move.

652
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:47,755
You can do this. Go get 'em.

653
00:38:52,297 --> 00:38:56,297
All right, all right. Hey, hey,
hey, hey. I'm driving! I'm... Dude! Out!

654
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,645
<i>Get out of the vehicle.</i>

655
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:00,713
Come on!

656
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,422
Come on, quick! Here we go!

657
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,505
- Hey!
- Get outta the car, man!

658
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:06,797
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

659
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,463
Oh, my God! It's an automatic!

660
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,107
- I'm a little rusty! Relax!
- It's not that complicated!

661
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:26,130
All right!

662
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:28,547
I mean, I'm used to something
with more pop under the hood,

663
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,088
but, man, this baby really handles!

664
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:34,047
I mean, can't you just wave your hand
and Jedi mind trick the cops?

665
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,755
I'm Santa Claus, Teddy, not Yoda.

666
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:44,505
Reindeer!

667
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:46,755
Comet!

668
00:39:47,797 --> 00:39:49,755
Blitzen!

669
00:39:51,547 --> 00:39:52,797
Where are you?

670
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,797
Shh, it's okay. It's okay.

671
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:06,047
I won't hurt you. I'm with Santa.

672
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,255
You can trust me.

673
00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:15,213
Here!

674
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:17,963
It's just a candy cane.

675
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:19,963
Don't you want some?

676
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:24,213
It's okay.

677
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,088
I'm one of the good guys.

678
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,338
You can trust me.

679
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:46,630
There you go. It's okay.

680
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,380
It's okay.

681
00:40:54,213 --> 00:40:56,297
I'm Kate, and you're...

682
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,422
Comet.

683
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,797
Comet? <i>The</i> Comet?

684
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:03,297
Wow,
you're really famous where I come from!

685
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,338
Santa's really worried about you.

686
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,255
Is it okay if I take you to him?

687
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:11,338
Okay.

688
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,213
Whoa!

689
00:41:18,922 --> 00:41:20,005
Whoo-hoo!

690
00:41:24,838 --> 00:41:28,213
Trading in eight reindeer
for 400 horses!

691
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:33,939
We've been in enough crashes

692
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:35,422
for one night, don't you think?

693
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:38,338
Hang on. I think I can lose 'em!

694
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:54,005
Santa!

695
00:41:54,755 --> 00:41:55,797
Hang on!

696
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:18,588
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

697
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:22,713
If you ever meet Mrs. Claus...

698
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,922
maybe just...

699
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:27,880
...skip this part.

700
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,547
<i>Hands outside the vehicle!</i>

701
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,430
<i>- Step out of the car!</i>
- You gotta be kidding.

702
00:42:45,255 --> 00:42:48,338
- Get out of the car!
- You heard the man! Get out! Now!

703
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:51,713
Dave? Little Mikey!

704
00:42:52,213 --> 00:42:54,505
Look at the two of you,
all grown up!

705
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:57,130
Now, they were always good kids.
Well, almost...

706
00:42:57,213 --> 00:42:59,189
You are under arrest
for driving a stolen vehicle!

707
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,053
Yeah, the car's stolen,
but we didn't steal it.

708
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,797
We were just borrowing it
before bringing it back to the station.

709
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,255
That's the first time I heard that one.
How about you, Dave?

710
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:07,838
This job's always full of surprises.

711
00:43:07,922 --> 00:43:11,255
I'm not joking!
We're gonna return the car, good as new!

712
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,755
Yeah? How you plan on doing that?

713
00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:15,463
My crew of elves.

714
00:43:16,672 --> 00:43:19,463
Elves? Right. They're good with bodywork?

715
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,922
They're amazing, actually.

716
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,255
They build thousands of cars every year.

717
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:27,422
Oh yeah? They work in Detroit?

718
00:43:28,588 --> 00:43:29,797
Little further north.

719
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:31,505
Oh, he's serious.

720
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:36,005
What was I thinking, Mr... uh...
You know what? We never got your name.

721
00:43:36,463 --> 00:43:38,547
Come on, fellas. Really? I...

722
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,297
Claus. Santa.

723
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:43,672
Right, right.
Why don't you give us a "Ho ho ho"

724
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:46,963
- so we really know it's you?
- I don't do "Ho ho ho."

725
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,547
All right, then, Santa Claus.

726
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,950
Tell us what you're doing
on Christmas Eve borrowing a car.

727
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,838
We're trying to save Christmas.

728
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:56,088
- Oh, is Christmas in trouble?
- Big trouble.

729
00:43:56,172 --> 00:44:00,047
Speaking of which, it would be great
if the two of you could help me

730
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:02,588
- track down my reindeer.
- No can do.

731
00:44:02,672 --> 00:44:05,380
- Reindeer fall under Animal Control.
- Give 'em a call!

732
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:08,172
Okay, Santa Claus.
That's enough fun for one night.

733
00:44:08,255 --> 00:44:11,505
- Gotta take you to the station. Let's go.
- Wait! Look, it wasn't his fault.

734
00:44:12,213 --> 00:44:15,213
This was all me. I took the car.

735
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:17,672
What is your name, kid?

736
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:19,255
Teddy Pierce.

737
00:44:20,713 --> 00:44:22,838
What's this man's relationship
with you, Teddy?

738
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:24,713
Well, he's my, um...

739
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,797
my... well, he came down my chimney.

740
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,588
- What?
- So, he broke into your home?

741
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:34,047
No, I... He's Santa Claus.
That's...

742
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:36,005
what he does. I...

743
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,255
Look, guys, okay,

744
00:44:38,338 --> 00:44:40,172
I wouldn't have believed him either,
but...

745
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:42,975
- I mean, I saw the sleigh, the reindeer...
- Where do you live, son?

746
00:44:44,005 --> 00:44:45,005
Lowell.

747
00:44:45,588 --> 00:44:46,588
Massachusetts.

748
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,505
Let me get this straight.
You broke into this boy's residence

749
00:44:49,588 --> 00:44:51,398
- and took him a thousand miles from home?
- Wait.

750
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,255
This wasn't my idea!
Look, Mikey, Officer Jameson...

751
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:56,588
- Impressive. You can read a name tag.
- Unfortunately...

752
00:44:56,672 --> 00:44:57,838
Unfortunately for you,

753
00:44:57,922 --> 00:45:01,380
- saving Christmas ain't in your cards.
- Yeah, well, it's gonna be tight!

754
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:03,005
- Let's go.
- Wait.

755
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:04,755
Huh? Ah.

756
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:06,547
What is that sound?

757
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:08,213
Sleigh bells!

758
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:11,797
Are you listening?

759
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:13,463
To what?

760
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,880
- Ha!
- Help me, somebody!

761
00:45:18,963 --> 00:45:19,963
I'm falling!

762
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,130
Comet, you can slow down!

763
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,422
I'm new at this!

764
00:45:28,297 --> 00:45:29,797
You're going too fast!

765
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:32,463
All right, Kate. Slow down.
Slow down, Kate!

766
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:34,088
Whoa! Slow your roll. Get back here.

767
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:35,963
- All right, all right.
- Comet, stop!

768
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:39,213
- Help me!
- Teddy, here. Take this.

769
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:43,005
Find my sack of toys.
It'll lead you to the elves.

770
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:44,088
Go!

771
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:45,672
- Teddy!
- Kate!

772
00:45:45,755 --> 00:45:49,463
Hey! Mikey, get the kid!
I'm putting this guy in the car!

773
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:52,130
Teddy!

774
00:45:52,213 --> 00:45:54,213
I can't stay on! Help!

775
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:56,505
- Attaboy, Teddy!
- Hey!

776
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,713
- Come back here!
- Find the elves!

777
00:45:59,213 --> 00:46:01,630
- They'll know what to do!
- Teddy!

778
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:12,380
Uh-oh.

779
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,273
- They need to get up.
- Come on!

780
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:15,880
- They need to fly!
- Hey!

781
00:46:15,963 --> 00:46:18,547
- Attach Comet's jingle bells!
- Get back here!

782
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,880
What?

783
00:46:20,422 --> 00:46:22,213
Jingle bells!

784
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,088
- What did he say?
- All I heard was "jingle bells."

785
00:46:25,797 --> 00:46:28,505
Jingle bells... Jingle bells...

786
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:31,713
Jingle bells!

787
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,463
Up! Up!

788
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:44,755
Stop!

789
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:45,880
Come on, Comet!

790
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:48,463
Fly for me! You can do it!

791
00:46:48,547 --> 00:46:50,547
Fly, fly, fly!

792
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,213
Whoa!

793
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,297
Oh!

794
00:46:56,588 --> 00:46:58,255
- Hey!
- Get down!

795
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:01,213
- Yeah!
- We did it!

796
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:03,213
You guys! Turn around!

797
00:47:03,297 --> 00:47:04,463
Guys!

798
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:05,713
Just turn around!

799
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:12,172
What am I looking at?

800
00:47:12,422 --> 00:47:13,463
Damn it!

801
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:20,630
Sorry you missed it, Dave.

802
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:28,588
Yeah!

803
00:47:33,547 --> 00:47:36,172
I can't believe it! We're flying!

804
00:47:36,255 --> 00:47:37,422
I know!

805
00:47:39,463 --> 00:47:41,088
I'm on Donner. What about you?

806
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,463
Comet! How cool is this?

807
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:49,255
Oh!

808
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:51,255
The bag of toys!

809
00:47:51,588 --> 00:47:54,713
- That means we're close!
- Where do you think it is?

810
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:56,880
Must be around here somewhere.

811
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,547
Let's land.
It'll be easier to find from the ground.

812
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:06,547
Okay.

813
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:22,213
Take some. Go on!

814
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:23,297
Come on!

815
00:48:23,713 --> 00:48:27,588
- Hang tight and blend in!
- Come on! Let's go, let's go!

816
00:48:33,922 --> 00:48:35,338
We're really close.

817
00:48:35,422 --> 00:48:37,338
You think it's inside the church?

818
00:48:37,422 --> 00:48:38,422
No.

819
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:41,255
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.
- Yeah...

820
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:57,963
This was his favorite song.

821
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:01,130
He sang it every Christmas Eve.

822
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,047
You know, I haven't been to church
since he...

823
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:10,505
I know. Me neither.

824
00:49:24,922 --> 00:49:26,356
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! God!

825
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,505
Would it kill you to leave me alone
for one minute?

826
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:53,963
He would be so disappointed in me.

827
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:57,380
I know Mom sure is.

828
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:01,380
That's because she knows, deep down,

829
00:50:01,463 --> 00:50:03,213
you're not such a total screw-up.

830
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,213
Thanks. You're, uh...
You're making me feel great.

831
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,422
Sorry.

832
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:13,047
No, I deserve it.

833
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:18,505
I know I've been an awful brother,
it's just...

834
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:23,297
I've been so mad at him.

835
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,838
I mean, he spent years
helping other people, but where is he now?

836
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:30,213
When I need him?

837
00:50:31,922 --> 00:50:34,213
Why did he have to go
into that stupid fire?

838
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:39,963
He had a wife...
and two kids, and he gave it all up...

839
00:50:40,963 --> 00:50:43,422
just to save some random strangers.

840
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:50,338
And now,
I'd give anything just to tell him...

841
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:54,255
Tell him what?

842
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:02,380
Teddy, you aren't such an awful brother.

843
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:05,463
Dad wouldn't be disappointed in you.

844
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:07,922
You know how I know?

845
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:09,338
How?

846
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:11,880
Because I see him all the time...

847
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:13,505
in you.

848
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:19,172
You're just saying that
'cause you wanna save Christmas.

849
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,797
True, but...

850
00:51:21,172 --> 00:51:22,505
I also believe it.

851
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:25,047
You just gotta believe it, too.

852
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,422
Thanks, Kate.

853
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:31,755
Should we hug it out?

854
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:36,255
In your dreams.

855
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:42,797
Come on.

856
00:51:57,213 --> 00:52:01,130
Why must they keep drawing me like that?

857
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:05,463
I mean, does my butt really look that big
to you?

858
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:07,505
Yeah.

859
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:10,130
Now, sit down
or I'll cuff you to the desk.

860
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,797
Listen, pal. You can lose the shtick.

861
00:52:17,088 --> 00:52:18,297
I've had a long day,

862
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,255
so just tell me your name,
and I don't wanna hear Santa Claus.

863
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,255
And you won't. Officially,

864
00:52:23,713 --> 00:52:26,297
it's Saint Nicholas. I prefer Saint Nick.

865
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,672
And I'm actually...
I'm not officially an official saint.

866
00:52:29,755 --> 00:52:32,588
I mean, they haven't bestowed that title
upon me officially, so...

867
00:52:32,672 --> 00:52:34,713
- I guess it's who you know.
- Buddy,

868
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:36,672
I'm about at the end of my rope here.

869
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:38,213
Me too.

870
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:53,213
So, what? Did you rob a toy store, too?

871
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,172
Wait a minute.

872
00:52:56,922 --> 00:52:58,172
We frisked you.

873
00:52:58,255 --> 00:52:59,422
Yeah, you did.

874
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:01,380
So, what is all this stuff?

875
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,380
You honestly don't remember, do you?

876
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:10,713
These are all the things
you ever dreamed of when you were a kid.

877
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,380
Everything you ever really wanted
for Christmas.

878
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:17,005
Starting from the age of six.

879
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:21,588
You're right.

880
00:53:21,672 --> 00:53:24,463
Mm.
Now, you interrupted me at age nine.

881
00:53:24,547 --> 00:53:27,963
- Should I continue?
- No. No, that... that's enough.

882
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:30,047
Good, let's just fast-forward
to this year.

883
00:53:31,297 --> 00:53:32,713
You know what I want for Christmas?

884
00:53:32,797 --> 00:53:35,130
It's my job, Dave.

885
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,880
Okay, then, smart guy.

886
00:53:40,422 --> 00:53:41,463
What do I want?

887
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:44,297
Lisa.

888
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,172
Lisa?

889
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,588
- Your ex-wife.
- I know who Lisa is.

890
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,380
- How did you...
- She left you a couple years ago,

891
00:53:58,463 --> 00:54:01,172
and all you want
for Christmas is for her to come back.

892
00:54:01,463 --> 00:54:04,630
- Yeah, well, that ain't ever gonna happen.
- Yeah, I think maybe.

893
00:54:04,713 --> 00:54:07,422
Okay, look, pal. You don't walk in here
and talk about my ex-wife.

894
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:10,588
Dave, just... just give her a call.

895
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:16,088
- She doesn't wanna talk to me.
- Yes! Yes, she does!

896
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:19,047
Now, she's...
she's having second thoughts and...

897
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,005
she's lonely, too.

898
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:23,422
And she really misses you!

899
00:54:23,505 --> 00:54:26,172
Now I know you're out of your tree.

900
00:54:26,255 --> 00:54:28,838
Will you please stop this?

901
00:54:28,922 --> 00:54:30,463
You know who I am!

902
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:32,713
I mean, you've always been a suspicious,
doubtful type.

903
00:54:32,797 --> 00:54:34,317
That's probably why you're a good cop.

904
00:54:34,797 --> 00:54:38,588
But deep down, you know that I know
what everybody wants for Christmas.

905
00:54:38,672 --> 00:54:40,672
So, just give her a call, Dave!

906
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:49,588
I don't know how you know all this stuff.

907
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:52,505
I don't know where the reindeer came from.

908
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:55,588
I don't know where they went,
but I know what the reality is.

909
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:57,297
You stole a car.

910
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,338
You evaded a police officer,
not to mention child endangerment

911
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,797
and potential kidnapping.

912
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,630
These are some serious charges.

913
00:55:04,797 --> 00:55:05,922
Mm-hmm.

914
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,630
You know what's serious, Dave?

915
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,588
Christmas spirit is already down to 31%.

916
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,213
The longer I stay in here,
the lower it's gonna go,

917
00:55:19,297 --> 00:55:22,588
and the lower it goes means
people are gonna start acting cranky.

918
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:24,088
Depressed.

919
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,088
Angry.

920
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:29,130
And that's
when bad things start to happen,

921
00:55:29,547 --> 00:55:31,088
like a lot more crime.

922
00:55:31,422 --> 00:55:35,588
More than you've seen here in a long time,
and we're in Chicago, for goodness' sake!

923
00:55:36,047 --> 00:55:40,338
Oh, I expect this station will be bursting
at the seams come morning.

924
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,922
But there is a bright spot, Dave.

925
00:55:45,338 --> 00:55:47,880
There's still time
for you to make it right.

926
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,172
Okay.

927
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,630
Let's make it right.

928
00:55:57,713 --> 00:56:01,380
I knew, given enough evidence,
that eventually you'd come around.

929
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:05,880
I don't know
if you're some kind of Las Vegas magician

930
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,922
or a freak who hacks into
people's personal lives on the Internet.

931
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:11,838
Either way, hope you didn't make plans
for New Year's.

932
00:56:11,922 --> 00:56:13,505
You're gonna be here a while.

933
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,172
- We're really close!
- It's gotta be here!

934
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,088
Teddy, look!

935
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:29,088
Awesome!

936
00:56:32,213 --> 00:56:35,463
Now we just need to get back to Santa.

937
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:42,463
Be careful, Teddy!

938
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:44,172
Don't fall.

939
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,005
Hello?

940
00:56:58,672 --> 00:56:59,672
Elves?

941
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,172
We're with Santa and we need your help!

942
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:05,172
Hello?

943
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,588
Anybody in there?

944
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:10,338
What are you doing?

945
00:57:11,255 --> 00:57:12,963
I'm just looking!

946
00:57:16,588 --> 00:57:17,588
Hello?

947
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,005
Anybody there?

948
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,130
Kate?

949
00:57:23,588 --> 00:57:24,588
Kate!

950
00:57:27,213 --> 00:57:28,213
Kate!

951
00:57:30,422 --> 00:57:33,463
Kate! Can you hear me?

952
00:57:36,672 --> 00:57:37,797
Hey, what you doing?

953
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:40,630
What's inside that bag?

954
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:42,422
Who you talking to?

955
00:57:42,505 --> 00:57:43,505
Nothing, nobody.

956
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,505
Well, that ain't what it sounded like.

957
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:47,880
Listen, guys.

958
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:49,380
Okay, respect.

959
00:57:49,797 --> 00:57:52,005
If it's okay with you,
I'll just be on my way.

960
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,213
Nobody said it was okay.

961
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:56,922
Come on, guys.

962
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:58,963
- It's Christmas.
- Come on.

963
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:01,547
Why are we even bothering with this fool?

964
00:58:02,088 --> 00:58:03,255
Yeah, you're right.

965
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:05,797
Just hand over that bag.

966
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:08,422
No, I can't do that.

967
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:10,172
Oh!

968
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:11,535
- Tough guy over here.
- Oh yeah!

969
00:58:13,922 --> 00:58:15,505
You think you're a tough guy?

970
00:58:16,922 --> 00:58:19,213
What can possibly be in that bag...

971
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:22,213
that could be worth
what's about to happen to you?

972
00:58:25,213 --> 00:58:26,505
You're coming with us.

973
00:58:26,588 --> 00:58:27,588
No.

974
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,597
- The bag!
- Don't touch that!

975
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,755
Put him in the car!

976
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:37,922
Hello?

977
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,047
Teddy, this is incredible!

978
00:58:44,963 --> 00:58:46,047
Elves!

979
00:58:46,755 --> 00:58:48,213
Anyone there?

980
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,047
Hey! Come back!

981
00:58:59,005 --> 00:59:01,380
Where did you go?

982
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:03,797
Come back!

983
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,088
Whoa!

984
00:59:56,922 --> 00:59:59,463
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

985
00:59:59,547 --> 01:00:02,297
Help!

986
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:21,963
That is so cool.

987
01:00:55,505 --> 01:00:58,755
I think I'm in the North Pole.

988
01:01:23,088 --> 01:01:25,505
<i>Dear Santa...</i>

989
01:01:32,297 --> 01:01:34,505
<i>I know I haven't been doing
too well in school,</i>

990
01:01:34,588 --> 01:01:37,047
<i>especially since I got a D minus
in Spanish.</i>

991
01:01:37,588 --> 01:01:41,338
<i>Dear Santa, This year
we would like a pony for Christmas.</i>

992
01:01:41,422 --> 01:01:44,380
<i>But Mom says the house is too small,
so maybe just a puppy.</i>

993
01:01:44,463 --> 01:01:45,505
<i>A robot...</i>

994
01:01:45,588 --> 01:01:48,172
<i>And a really cool pair
of awesome sunglasses.</i>

995
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,922
<i>I'm Bing Bellamy, and all I want
for Christmas is a snowboard!</i>

996
01:03:16,922 --> 01:03:18,588
Teddy wrote one this year?

997
01:03:26,922 --> 01:03:29,797
"Dear Santa, This is Teddy Pierce.

998
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,088
I haven't written to you in a long time.

999
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:33,338
You know how it is,

1000
01:03:33,422 --> 01:03:35,672
once you get older,
the whole Christmas thing

1001
01:03:35,755 --> 01:03:36,755
seems pretty lame.

1002
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,338
But this year is different.

1003
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:41,672
This year, I have a special request.

1004
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,172
I'd really like to see my dad again.

1005
01:03:45,672 --> 01:03:48,047
I'm not even sure
if it's something you can do.

1006
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,755
But I really need to tell him that..."

1007
01:04:29,588 --> 01:04:30,422
Hello.

1008
01:04:30,505 --> 01:04:32,505
Ah...

1009
01:04:34,005 --> 01:04:35,755
He-llo?

1010
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:38,047
I'm Kate.

1011
01:04:38,547 --> 01:04:39,547
What's your name?

1012
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:43,380
Lars.

1013
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:53,088
Hey, guys.

1014
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:55,338
I'm Kate Pierce.

1015
01:04:57,422 --> 01:04:58,588
Santa sent me.

1016
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,922
Guys?

1017
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:07,213
<i>Guys?</i>

1018
01:05:10,547 --> 01:05:13,213
<i>Guys! Let me go!</i>

1019
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,088
<i>What are you doing with my camera?</i>

1020
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:18,047
<i>Give it back! You're gonna break it.</i>

1021
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:25,005
Hey, let me go!
Guys, let me go!

1022
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,880
Hey, come on, let me out!

1023
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:29,338
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

1024
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,463
Start talking!

1025
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:38,047
Where is Santa Claus?

1026
01:05:38,588 --> 01:05:40,338
Let me explain what happened!

1027
01:05:40,422 --> 01:05:42,005
You see, after the sleigh crashed,

1028
01:05:42,088 --> 01:05:43,755
we lost the reindeer.

1029
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:48,213
- You lost the reindeer?
- Blitzen!

1030
01:05:48,713 --> 01:05:49,713
Cupid?

1031
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:55,380
Santa Claus told me to find you guys!

1032
01:05:55,463 --> 01:05:57,898
He said you guys were the only ones
who would know what to do!

1033
01:05:57,922 --> 01:05:59,797
He said Christmas must endure!

1034
01:06:00,005 --> 01:06:02,463
"Christmas must endure."

1035
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,588
Christmas must endure?

1036
01:06:05,672 --> 01:06:08,213
- Eh?
- Christmas must endure!

1037
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,297
Ah!

1038
01:06:09,630 --> 01:06:10,755
Hmm...

1039
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:12,963
To the book!

1040
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:20,713
<i>True Believers?</i>

1041
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:22,630
Pierce.

1042
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:30,588
My family tree.

1043
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,213
Everybody except Teddy.

1044
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,880
Oh...

1045
01:06:39,922 --> 01:06:41,797
But, wow! I come from a long line

1046
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,047
of True Believers!

1047
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:46,547
She is a True Believer!

1048
01:07:06,047 --> 01:07:09,172
And then the reindeer just...
Boom! They just flew away!

1049
01:07:09,338 --> 01:07:11,213
Oh, you're gonna walk away from me? Huh?

1050
01:07:11,297 --> 01:07:13,297
I saw a bunch of reindeer fly
into the night sky!

1051
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,898
- I am not crazy!
- Yes, you are.

1052
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:16,922
Man,
have you ever seen anything like this?

1053
01:07:17,005 --> 01:07:19,130
I've never seen it this busy
on Christmas Eve.

1054
01:07:21,588 --> 01:07:23,255
He said this would happen.

1055
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,797
Are you locking me up
on Christmas Eve?

1056
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,338
The least you could do is play
some Christmas music.

1057
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:34,922
<i>- </i>Am I right, Santa?
- I hear you.

1058
01:07:35,963 --> 01:07:40,338
Oh, brother, the mood in this place
is really bringing Christmas spirit down,

1059
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:41,630
way down.

1060
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:46,922
Whoa! Christmas spirit is down to 19%?

1061
01:07:47,005 --> 01:07:48,925
If I don't do something quick,
this night's over.

1062
01:07:49,672 --> 01:07:51,130
Wait a minute, music!

1063
01:07:51,213 --> 01:07:52,838
Maybe you're onto something!

1064
01:07:53,588 --> 01:07:55,463
- Wolfie! Dusty!
- Huh?

1065
01:07:56,713 --> 01:08:01,588
Do you remember what you got
for Christmas in 1971?

1066
01:08:04,005 --> 01:08:06,213
Uh...

1067
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:12,963
I got the super fly
Sunburst Epiphone Casino, man!

1068
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:14,588
Two-tone Gretsch Anniversary.

1069
01:08:14,672 --> 01:08:15,797
Where are they now?

1070
01:08:16,213 --> 01:08:18,255
In, uh... In the pawn shop.

1071
01:08:18,338 --> 01:08:19,755
That's a shame.

1072
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,463
'Cause you two guys were really good.

1073
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,505
Unfortunately, some other habits
took precedence, you dig?

1074
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:28,380
I know, I know.

1075
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,713
But this is Christmas Eve...

1076
01:08:31,963 --> 01:08:34,713
and that means there's magic in the air!

1077
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:37,047
Wow.

1078
01:08:38,422 --> 01:08:39,547
- Magic.
- Wow!

1079
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:42,463
Magic!

1080
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:45,505
- What am I supposed to do with this, man?
- Play it.

1081
01:08:45,797 --> 01:08:48,547
- I can't play this thing!
- Are you sure?

1082
01:08:48,755 --> 01:08:49,755
Give it a try.

1083
01:09:00,172 --> 01:09:01,672
Yeah!

1084
01:09:01,755 --> 01:09:04,797
Now, ladies...

1085
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,755
...let's get this party started.

1086
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:18,088
Talk to me, ladies!

1087
01:10:26,213 --> 01:10:28,005
Is there a piano in this joint?

1088
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:34,547
Oh!

1089
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:02,588
What do we got here?

1090
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,797
Well, Christmas came early this year, huh?

1091
01:11:11,297 --> 01:11:12,672
Where did you get this?

1092
01:11:12,963 --> 01:11:14,172
From this little dude.

1093
01:11:16,213 --> 01:11:17,213
Ah.

1094
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:28,213
Coal?

1095
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,922
Is this some kind of a joke?

1096
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,838
Next time you morons waste my time...

1097
01:11:59,088 --> 01:12:00,255
you're done.

1098
01:12:05,672 --> 01:12:08,588
No! No, my sister's in there!

1099
01:12:10,672 --> 01:12:11,880
Your sister?

1100
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,755
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but please don't do that!

1101
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:20,588
Come on, man! Please!

1102
01:12:28,047 --> 01:12:30,547
Get back! Get back!

1103
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:34,463
Let me go, and nobody gets hurt!

1104
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:37,380
Take care of him!

1105
01:12:37,463 --> 01:12:39,463
Put him in the dumpsters out back!

1106
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,755
Oh... and not recycling.

1107
01:12:42,588 --> 01:12:43,672
He's compost.

1108
01:12:52,963 --> 01:12:54,172
Ah!

1109
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:56,880
What is that thing?

1110
01:12:57,297 --> 01:12:58,838
Hey, he's... he's actually kinda cute.

1111
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,213
Hey, little guy! What's your name?

1112
01:13:16,422 --> 01:13:19,130
Ooh!

1113
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:21,380
You're done! Naughty! Naughty!

1114
01:13:55,422 --> 01:13:57,672
Time to take out the trash.

1115
01:13:58,463 --> 01:14:00,297
Ready! Aim!

1116
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,422
Fire!

1117
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,940
Let's get outta here!

1118
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:17,755
Wait. We missed one.

1119
01:14:18,422 --> 01:14:19,422
No!

1120
01:14:19,713 --> 01:14:20,922
Get him!

1121
01:14:21,047 --> 01:14:22,505
No!

1122
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:24,880
No!

1123
01:14:31,588 --> 01:14:33,755
Wait! I'm one of the good guys!

1124
01:14:34,255 --> 01:14:35,630
Wait, wait, wait!

1125
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:38,422
Stop!

1126
01:14:40,505 --> 01:14:41,755
He's with me.

1127
01:14:44,463 --> 01:14:46,463
I never have any fun.

1128
01:14:46,922 --> 01:14:50,130
- Kate, are you okay?
- Better than okay!

1129
01:14:50,547 --> 01:14:51,838
And I brought help!

1130
01:14:51,922 --> 01:14:54,088
- I can... I see that.
- Ow, ow!

1131
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:56,797
- Let's get the reindeer and the sleigh.
- The sleigh's busted.

1132
01:14:57,297 --> 01:14:58,297
Right.

1133
01:14:58,547 --> 01:14:59,880
Can you guys fix it?

1134
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:01,755
Are you kidding?

1135
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:07,213
Cool!
Now we just need to find Santa!

1136
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:09,755
You guys know where he is?

1137
01:15:10,213 --> 01:15:11,422
It's not good.

1138
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,672
He's in jail?

1139
01:15:13,755 --> 01:15:16,463
Poor Santa. I'll bet he's freaking out.

1140
01:15:18,588 --> 01:15:20,005
One more thing!

1141
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,255
Down your chimney!

1142
01:15:48,047 --> 01:15:49,547
Listen to me now!

1143
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:06,505
Yeah, I'm back!

1144
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:12,588
Whoo!

1145
01:16:15,255 --> 01:16:18,505
And the reindeer just... flew away!

1146
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:22,963
Who's crazy now? I quit!

1147
01:16:24,922 --> 01:16:27,505
Ah!

1148
01:16:28,588 --> 01:16:30,922
Not too bad for our first gig, huh?

1149
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:34,713
I have seen a lot
of strange things in my time, but this...

1150
01:16:35,255 --> 01:16:37,922
this takes it to a whole other level.

1151
01:16:38,005 --> 01:16:40,088
Oh, wait till you see what happens next.

1152
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:43,130
Okay, I want answers.
Real answers, right now.

1153
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:45,130
We all want answers, Dave.

1154
01:16:45,588 --> 01:16:46,588
Especially Lisa.

1155
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:49,755
So first, why don't you answer that?

1156
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,922
Answer what?

1157
01:17:08,672 --> 01:17:10,838
Lisa, hey!

1158
01:17:10,922 --> 01:17:11,922
Why are you c...

1159
01:17:17,797 --> 01:17:18,797
Yeah.

1160
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:21,630
That'd be great.

1161
01:17:22,297 --> 01:17:23,297
Good.

1162
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:25,130
Okay.

1163
01:17:27,922 --> 01:17:28,922
Lisa.

1164
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,880
She invited me out
for coffee this morning.

1165
01:17:32,963 --> 01:17:34,338
I thought she might.

1166
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,922
How?

1167
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:38,630
I mean...

1168
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:40,755
How?

1169
01:17:44,547 --> 01:17:46,047
Merry Christmas, Dave.

1170
01:17:48,922 --> 01:17:50,922
Whoa!

1171
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,755
Well, that's, uh...
That's my little buddy Hugg.

1172
01:17:53,838 --> 01:17:56,255
He's, uh... bringing me a present.

1173
01:18:02,797 --> 01:18:03,922
Santa!

1174
01:18:05,838 --> 01:18:09,005
Mrs. Claus told you to take a spare.

1175
01:18:09,338 --> 01:18:10,713
I know, I know.

1176
01:18:11,297 --> 01:18:14,130
Well, guys.
It's been great jamming with you.

1177
01:18:14,213 --> 01:18:15,505
- Yeah.
- You too!

1178
01:18:16,047 --> 01:18:18,797
- Ladies...
- Bye, Santa.

1179
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:20,255
That's my cue!

1180
01:18:21,172 --> 01:18:22,422
Christmas...

1181
01:18:25,797 --> 01:18:26,880
is back on.

1182
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:29,231
- All right, man!
- Yeah! That's cool, man!

1183
01:18:29,255 --> 01:18:30,380
Oh, um...

1184
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:34,755
Try to be good.

1185
01:18:34,838 --> 01:18:37,922
- I don't know, man.
- We'll try. We'll try.

1186
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,505
We can keep these, right, Santa?

1187
01:18:42,255 --> 01:18:43,255
Well, Dave?

1188
01:18:54,005 --> 01:18:56,172
- Go.
- Welcome back.

1189
01:18:56,463 --> 01:18:59,338
Whoa!

1190
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:06,255
- Santa!
- Santa!

1191
01:19:06,338 --> 01:19:07,755
I can't believe it!

1192
01:19:07,838 --> 01:19:11,088
- You busted outta jail!
- First time for everything, Katie Cat!

1193
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:13,797
How's the sleigh looking? Oh...

1194
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,463
Looking good, Lars!

1195
01:19:15,547 --> 01:19:18,130
Thank you, Santa.

1196
01:19:20,963 --> 01:19:24,672
Let's go to work.
Whoa! No, no, no, no, no, no!

1197
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,963
What's wrong?

1198
01:19:27,088 --> 01:19:28,963
I lost all track of time.

1199
01:19:31,797 --> 01:19:34,922
We've only got less than an hour
before the sun rises.

1200
01:19:35,463 --> 01:19:38,297
But... we can still save Christmas, right?

1201
01:19:40,172 --> 01:19:42,005
We're at the end of my window, Kate.

1202
01:19:45,463 --> 01:19:47,880
Well... I mean,
there's gotta be something we can do.

1203
01:19:49,172 --> 01:19:50,463
I'm afraid not, Teddy.

1204
01:19:50,922 --> 01:19:54,422
But that can't be!
There can't be Christmas without presents!

1205
01:19:54,505 --> 01:19:56,297
Without Santa Claus!

1206
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:58,463
We ruined Christmas!

1207
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,713
Listen, Santa.

1208
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:07,755
We started something last night,
and we're gonna finish it.

1209
01:20:07,838 --> 01:20:11,380
Now, I don't know how you guys
do things in the North Pole, but...

1210
01:20:11,922 --> 01:20:13,672
a Pierce always sees it through.

1211
01:20:15,963 --> 01:20:17,755
I admire your passion, Teddy.

1212
01:20:19,172 --> 01:20:21,880
But I haven't cut it this close in,
I don't know, maybe ever.

1213
01:20:21,963 --> 01:20:23,838
I... I just don't see how it's possible.

1214
01:20:23,922 --> 01:20:26,797
You do the entire world in one night
all by yourself!

1215
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,047
I mean, imagine what we could cover
if we all work together!

1216
01:20:30,797 --> 01:20:31,797
Yeah!

1217
01:20:32,005 --> 01:20:34,422
Just think of us as Santa's helpers!

1218
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:37,047
Helpers?

1219
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:41,005
Well, I've never had human helpers
in the sleigh before...

1220
01:20:42,963 --> 01:20:44,255
I dunno, maybe there's...

1221
01:20:44,755 --> 01:20:46,755
some way we could work together to...

1222
01:20:47,338 --> 01:20:49,172
make things move faster.

1223
01:20:49,255 --> 01:20:51,838
We've only got a little bit
of North America left.

1224
01:20:51,922 --> 01:20:52,922
Wait a minute!

1225
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:54,672
Wait a minute...

1226
01:20:55,588 --> 01:20:59,047
If I didn't have to carry my sack,
I could move twice as fast!

1227
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:00,672
All right, this just might work!

1228
01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:03,630
Now, Kate, you're in charge of getting
all the presents ready to go!

1229
01:21:03,713 --> 01:21:05,755
You just call out the addresses
and the names,

1230
01:21:05,838 --> 01:21:07,158
and you throw 'em outta the sack.

1231
01:21:07,213 --> 01:21:10,172
Just chuck 'em out.
I'll catch 'em, and I'll deliver!

1232
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:12,338
And that means, Teddy, you drive!

1233
01:21:12,797 --> 01:21:14,588
What? The sleigh?

1234
01:21:14,672 --> 01:21:16,338
No! The cop cruiser!

1235
01:21:16,422 --> 01:21:18,005
Of course the sleigh!

1236
01:21:18,172 --> 01:21:21,713
You...
You want me to drive... that?

1237
01:21:21,963 --> 01:21:23,963
Oh, I've seen you drive!

1238
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:27,172
Yeah, a car.
But, I mean, this is... This is...

1239
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:31,172
Now where is all that huff and puff
about "A Pierce always sees it through"?

1240
01:21:31,255 --> 01:21:33,672
That was before you told me
I was gonna have to drive!

1241
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:35,963
Well, this is the only way
we're gonna make it,

1242
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:38,630
so I guess it's gonna be baptism by fire!

1243
01:21:38,838 --> 01:21:41,297
Well, maybe I can help Kate
with presents, right?

1244
01:21:41,755 --> 01:21:42,755
Let's go!

1245
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:45,713
I told you, we're gonna have to move fast!

1246
01:21:48,922 --> 01:21:50,422
Come on! Hop in the back!

1247
01:21:51,547 --> 01:21:53,588
On, Donner! On, Blitzen!

1248
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:02,130
All right, Teddy, stand up!

1249
01:22:02,547 --> 01:22:03,380
Take them!

1250
01:22:03,463 --> 01:22:04,672
- What?
- Come on!

1251
01:22:05,005 --> 01:22:06,588
All right, you gotta hold them.

1252
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,713
Now we're gonna see what you're made of!

1253
01:22:08,797 --> 01:22:11,255
Now, just think
about where you wanna go...

1254
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,880
and go!

1255
01:22:13,005 --> 01:22:15,380
Oh no, no, no, no! Santa, I can't do this!

1256
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:17,505
Some things we gotta figure out
on our own, Teddy.

1257
01:22:17,588 --> 01:22:19,755
You can do it.

1258
01:22:19,838 --> 01:22:23,755
All right, here's the book
with all the names and addresses.

1259
01:22:23,838 --> 01:22:25,064
- Take a good look.
- Okay.

1260
01:22:25,088 --> 01:22:26,408
- Got it?
- Got it.

1261
01:22:26,463 --> 01:22:28,922
Don't be afraid!
Don't be afraid.

1262
01:22:29,797 --> 01:22:33,088
If there's one thing reindeer
can smell, it's fear!

1263
01:22:33,172 --> 01:22:34,713
Santa, help him!

1264
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:39,380
I can't control them!
Santa, this isn't funny!

1265
01:22:39,838 --> 01:22:42,130
Eight reindeer! How tough can it be?!

1266
01:22:45,255 --> 01:22:46,505
Teddy, watch out!

1267
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:52,963
Take that, fat man!

1268
01:22:53,047 --> 01:22:55,130
Whoa!

1269
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:03,338
They won't go up! What do I need to do?

1270
01:23:05,713 --> 01:23:08,547
You've always just had to do one thing,
Teddy.

1271
01:23:10,422 --> 01:23:11,588
Believe.

1272
01:23:11,672 --> 01:23:15,088
- But I do believe in you!
- No, no, no! I'm not talking about me.

1273
01:23:15,713 --> 01:23:17,463
You have to believe in yourself.

1274
01:23:18,422 --> 01:23:20,672
The way your mother believes in you.

1275
01:23:21,088 --> 01:23:22,630
And your sister.

1276
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:27,130
The way your father believed in you.

1277
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,172
You are a Pierce, Teddy!

1278
01:23:32,922 --> 01:23:34,047
And a Pierce...

1279
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:37,672
- Always sees it through!
- Yeah!

1280
01:23:38,172 --> 01:23:40,297

On, Donner! On, Blitzen!

1283
01:23:48,963 --> 01:23:50,338
All right, slow them down.

1284
01:23:50,422 --> 01:23:52,213
Slow down! Slow down!

1285
01:23:52,297 --> 01:23:53,505
Positions!

1286
01:23:57,213 --> 01:23:58,838

Can you believe that?

1291

James Hanson!

1292
01:24:26,547 --> 01:24:27,588
Show-off!

1293
01:24:38,713 --> 01:24:41,880
All set, go!

1294
01:24:41,963 --> 01:24:43,323
Hit that white button.

1295
01:25:15,088 --> 01:25:17,880
- All right, this one's to...

1296

1297
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:35,838
All right, guys!
This is it! Last city!

1298
01:25:49,422 --> 01:25:51,297
Getting tight!

1299
01:25:51,588 --> 01:25:53,672
Kate! Send in the troops!

1300
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:55,255
The troops?

1301
01:25:56,088 --> 01:25:57,088
The troops!

1302
01:25:58,172 --> 01:26:00,505
Guys! Santa needs you!

1303
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:03,963

- Reporting for duty!

Hunter and Connor Morris.
They live on 4433 Pacific Avenue!

1317
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,130
Hey, Santa!
I just spoke Elvish!

1318
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,797
Welcome to the club!

1319
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,338
We did it!

1320
01:27:22,047 --> 01:27:23,213
Hey, what's he doing?

1321
01:27:23,297 --> 01:27:26,130
His list. He's checking it twice.

1322
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:32,505
What is this?

1323
01:27:34,172 --> 01:27:35,213
Bjorn...

1324
01:27:35,297 --> 01:27:37,797
I told you, no food
or drinks in the sleigh!

1325
01:27:38,505 --> 01:27:40,422
I can't help it, Santa.

1326
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,338
I just <i>love </i>my candy canes.

1327
01:27:47,172 --> 01:27:49,838
- What's wrong?
- We missed one!

1328
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:54,172
Sanchez family, Mexico City!
We got exactly nine seconds!

1329
01:27:54,422 --> 01:27:56,130
Teddy, want me to take the reins?

1330
01:27:56,213 --> 01:27:58,755
Yah! On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On, Prancer!

1331
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:06,380
There! On the corner!

1332
01:28:07,963 --> 01:28:11,963
- There's no chimney!
- Well, sometimes you gotta improvise!

1333
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,297
Ha!

1334
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,005
- How much time we got?
- Three seconds.

1335
01:28:26,213 --> 01:28:28,255
Ah!

1336
01:28:36,213 --> 01:28:37,338
Shh!

1337
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:51,088
- Where's Santa?
- What's wrong?

1338
01:28:52,547 --> 01:28:55,672
- You did it!
- No! <i>We </i>did it!

1339
01:28:55,755 --> 01:28:59,755
All the presents delivered in record time,
and Christmas spirit is up to 95%.

1340
01:28:59,838 --> 01:29:01,338
Yeah!

1341
01:29:01,463 --> 01:29:04,005
Hey, hey! We gotta get back
to your house before your mom does!

1342
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:04,963
Here.

1343
01:29:05,047 --> 01:29:08,338
I think I kinda like sitting over here.

1344
01:29:08,422 --> 01:29:13,005
On, Dasher! On, Dancer! On, Prancer!
On, Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid!

1345
01:29:13,088 --> 01:29:14,672
On, Donner! On, Blitzen!

1346
01:29:21,505 --> 01:29:24,088
All right, now ease them down.

1347
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:26,255
Ease them down, that's it. Easy.

1348
01:29:27,005 --> 01:29:28,338
All right, pick your spot.

1349
01:29:28,755 --> 01:29:32,255
Let them down!

1350
01:29:33,422 --> 01:29:37,047
Perfect four-point landing!
And we beat your mom home, too!

1351
01:29:37,130 --> 01:29:39,047
- Yeah.
- That was awesome!

1352
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:41,713
- What was your favorite part?
- Easy! Riding the reindeer!

1353
01:29:41,797 --> 01:29:44,422
- Being in the North Pole!
- The car chase with the cops!

1354
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:46,380
You know, Santa?

1355
01:29:46,713 --> 01:29:48,513
Hey, that was the best night
of my whole life!

1356
01:29:48,588 --> 01:29:49,422
Mine, too.

1357
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:53,005
Oh, Christmas Eve is always the best night
of my life.

1358
01:29:54,297 --> 01:29:56,713
But now, it's time for me to go home.

1359
01:29:58,672 --> 01:30:00,130
Will we ever see you again?

1360
01:30:00,213 --> 01:30:02,047
Uh-uh. Not if I can help it.

1361
01:30:02,338 --> 01:30:03,505
But in the future,

1362
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:06,005
if I ever need two helpers...

1363
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:09,630
I know where to find the best
I've ever had.

1364
01:30:17,963 --> 01:30:19,130
Eh?

1365
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:23,088
Oh.

1366
01:30:23,588 --> 01:30:25,547
Aw.

1367
01:30:25,672 --> 01:30:28,172
He said the best <i>human </i>helpers
he's ever had.

1368
01:30:28,338 --> 01:30:31,588
I expect to see
your Spanish grades go up this year.

1369
01:30:31,922 --> 01:30:33,963
Now that you've learned another language.

1370
01:30:34,047 --> 01:30:35,047
Oh no!

1371
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:38,297
- What?
- We forgot to get Mom a present.

1372
01:30:38,422 --> 01:30:41,088
Oh, gee. Well...

1373
01:30:41,338 --> 01:30:44,130
Oh, that reminds me, though.
Uh...

1374
01:30:44,463 --> 01:30:46,047
Something I want you to have.

1375
01:30:50,672 --> 01:30:51,838
Your hat?

1376
01:30:52,255 --> 01:30:54,755
But... won't you need it to fly?

1377
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:56,797
No, Teddy.

1378
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:00,505
I'm Santa Claus.

1379
01:31:09,672 --> 01:31:13,630
Wait, so... this whole night,

1380
01:31:13,713 --> 01:31:15,880
- anytime you wanted, you could've just...
- Shh.

1381
01:31:19,005 --> 01:31:21,963
All right, now, I don't want any more
people to see me, so...

1382
01:31:22,547 --> 01:31:24,130
- Santa?
- Yeah?

1383
01:31:24,463 --> 01:31:25,505
Can you do it?

1384
01:31:26,463 --> 01:31:28,255
No way.

1385
01:31:28,338 --> 01:31:29,547
- Please?
- Not happening.

1386
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:30,505
- For me?
- Kate!

1387
01:31:30,588 --> 01:31:31,755
Just this once!

1388
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:34,963
All right.

1389
01:31:35,588 --> 01:31:37,047
Just this once.

1390
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:40,255
And just for you.

1391
01:31:46,338 --> 01:31:47,338
Be good.

1392
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:50,588
We will.

1393
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,380
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1394
01:32:20,463 --> 01:32:21,463
He did it.

1395
01:32:24,797 --> 01:32:27,088
That just really happened.

1396
01:32:27,672 --> 01:32:32,963
Yup, and I've got it all on...

1397
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:36,213
Oh man!

1398
01:32:36,463 --> 01:32:37,547
He took the tape.

1399
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:40,172
Did you really think
he was gonna let us keep it?

1400
01:32:40,797 --> 01:32:42,130
Guess not, but...

1401
01:32:42,713 --> 01:32:44,880
what if I forget everything
that happened tonight?

1402
01:32:45,505 --> 01:32:48,338
Come on! I won't let you forget anything
about tonight...

1403
01:32:48,422 --> 01:32:49,463
Katie Cat.

1404
01:32:50,338 --> 01:32:52,213
Me neither, Teddy Bear.

1405
01:32:52,297 --> 01:32:55,047
- Hug it out?
- Yeah.

1406
01:33:03,797 --> 01:33:05,880
Were you two just... hugging?

1407
01:33:06,588 --> 01:33:08,088
Yeah.

1408
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,755
What are you guys doing out here?

1409
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,297
Waiting for you.

1410
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:15,880
Oh!

1411
01:33:16,255 --> 01:33:17,838
What's that?

1412
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,255
It was a... a gift from a friend.

1413
01:33:21,713 --> 01:33:23,922
Hmm. Merry Christmas, guys!

1414
01:33:24,005 --> 01:33:26,463
Merry Christmas.

1415
01:33:27,297 --> 01:33:29,338
We should go inside.
It's freezing out here.

1416
01:33:29,588 --> 01:33:30,588
Yeah.

1417
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,547
- So, how was your night?
- You'll never believe it.

1418
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:39,172
- Yeah?
- Good.

1419
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:42,588
Well, what did you guys do all ni...

1420
01:33:44,172 --> 01:33:45,838
Oh, my God!

1421
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:50,672
This is exactly the way Dad used to...

1422
01:33:51,838 --> 01:33:53,630
I...

1423
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,130
This is the best Christmas present ever.

1424
01:34:03,547 --> 01:34:06,255
- Look, there's presents.
- Go open some presents.

1425
01:34:09,672 --> 01:34:12,255
- Oh, this is yours.
- This is yours.

1426
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:18,588
Ah!

1427
01:34:19,922 --> 01:34:21,797
It hurts my eyes.

1428
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:24,505
Aunt Peggy sure outdid herself this year.

1429
01:34:26,088 --> 01:34:27,213
What are those two?

1430
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:33,380
It's from Santa!

1431
01:34:35,088 --> 01:34:36,088
It's for you.

1432
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:41,005
I was kinda worried you weren't going
to make the cut this year.

1433
01:34:41,505 --> 01:34:44,588
Yeah. Guess I kinda worked it out
in the final hour.

1434
01:34:47,005 --> 01:34:49,213
- Oh boy!
- Yes!

1435
01:34:50,088 --> 01:34:51,630
Just what I asked for.

1436
01:34:51,713 --> 01:34:53,588
- Oh!
- Bones Brigade skateboard!

1437
01:34:53,672 --> 01:34:55,272
- It's the exact one?
- Yes!

1438
01:34:55,297 --> 01:34:57,172
Nice.

1439
01:34:57,255 --> 01:34:58,255
That's awesome.

1440
01:34:59,172 --> 01:35:00,422
What's that?

1441
01:35:01,463 --> 01:35:02,797
Santa wrote me back.

1442
01:35:05,338 --> 01:35:06,880
You wrote Santa a letter?

1443
01:35:07,130 --> 01:35:11,338
Yeah, I did.
Figured I'd cover all the bases.

1444
01:35:12,713 --> 01:35:13,963
Well, what's it say?

1445
01:35:15,505 --> 01:35:17,880
"Dear Teddy, I got your letter.

1446
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:21,547
I'm sorry, I don't really have the power
to grant your wish.

1447
01:35:21,963 --> 01:35:23,797
This was the best I could do.

1448
01:35:24,172 --> 01:35:25,172
Santa."

1449
01:35:34,797 --> 01:35:36,213
An old ornament...

1450
01:35:37,672 --> 01:35:38,963
Well, that's sweet.

1451
01:35:40,463 --> 01:35:42,797
There's a perfect spot for it on the tree.

1452
01:35:50,172 --> 01:35:52,132
- So, you're gonna wear a helmet with this?
- Yes.

1453
01:35:52,172 --> 01:35:53,047
Let's see.

1454
01:36:17,213 --> 01:36:18,463
I'm proud of you.

1455
01:36:20,005 --> 01:36:21,463
I'm proud of <i>you.</i>

1456
01:36:31,255 --> 01:36:33,130
- Yeah.
- Everything okay?

1457
01:36:35,547 --> 01:36:36,713
Never better.

1458
01:37:02,838 --> 01:37:05,213
Sounds like you had quite the night.

1459
01:37:05,297 --> 01:37:06,338
Uh...

1460
01:37:07,047 --> 01:37:09,130
It was a bit more hectic than usual...

1461
01:37:09,255 --> 01:37:12,505
But, I did get to speak
a lot of English last night!

1462
01:37:12,588 --> 01:37:14,213
Oh! I heard!

1463
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:17,547
- The whole village is buzzing.
- Mm.

1464
01:37:17,630 --> 01:37:21,463
Something about a... car chase
and a... jailbreak?

1465
01:37:21,547 --> 01:37:22,547
Uh-oh.

1466
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:23,630
No...

1467
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:28,088
Oh, you know how the elves exaggerate.
They get excited at the drop of a hat.

1468
01:37:29,755 --> 01:37:31,880
Especially when it's yours.

1469
01:37:33,005 --> 01:37:34,963
Well, there was that.

1470
01:37:35,922 --> 01:37:37,088
Purely intentional.

1471
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:39,172
I knew it.

1472
01:37:39,588 --> 01:37:41,838
- Well, Nick...
- Hmm?

1473
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:46,713
Were you just a little bit naughty
last night?

1474
01:37:47,505 --> 01:37:49,505
Oh, I...

1475
01:37:50,172 --> 01:37:53,213
Mm, I... In a nice way.

1476
01:37:54,838 --> 01:37:56,463
That's why I love you.

1477
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:01,213
Do you want to watch a movie?

1478
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:02,630
Mm.

1479
01:38:02,713 --> 01:38:04,255
<i>It's a Wonderful Life?</i>

1480
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:05,547
<i>White Christmas?</i>

1481
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:07,380
<i>The Grinch!</i>

1482
01:38:07,463 --> 01:38:10,297
Well, actually...

1483
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:13,547
I had something else in mind.

1484
01:38:15,588 --> 01:38:18,588
Something... really cool.

1485
01:39:32,088 --> 01:39:33,838
<i>Talk to me, ladies!</i>

1486
01:40:04,005 --> 01:40:05,547
<i>One more thing!</i>

1487
01:40:33,338 --> 01:40:34,672
<i>Listen to me now!</i>

1488
01:40:50,172 --> 01:40:51,505
<i>Yeah! I'm back!</i>

1489
01:40:52,305 --> 01:41:52,616
