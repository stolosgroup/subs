00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:46,460
The day, August 17th,

3
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:49,152
the year, 1835,

4
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,164
the man, me.

5
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,900
Charles Darwin.

6
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:57,377
This morning, we set sail
for our next grand adventure,

7
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,751
the galapagos

8
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:02,548
and whatever extraordinary creatures
await me

9
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:04,314
on these islands.

10
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,106
There's one now.

11
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:08,526
A blue-footed booby.

12
00:01:10,253 --> 00:01:12,416
- Blue.
- Booby.

13
00:01:46,798 --> 00:01:48,026
Booby.

14
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:56,355
Booby.

15
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:02,697
Booby.

16
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:15,889
Booby.

17
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,897
Ah, ed, this is embarrassing,
but you have a little,

18
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:23,988
yeah, right there, you got it.

19
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:26,962
Op, I know, give me a hand.

20
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,430
Booby.

21
00:02:35,838 --> 00:02:37,709
- He's fine.
- Okay, come on, brother.

22
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:40,009
The other flummels are waiting for us.

23
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:43,306
So, we're late, what's the worst thing
that could happen?

24
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,508
Extinct

25
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:09,774
Got it.

26
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,850
Listen up, flummels,

27
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:25,473
the countdown to the flower festival
has begun,

28
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:28,008
so, it's officially crunch time.

29
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:30,488
Hey Mali, here we are.

30
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:32,426
Almost right on time.

31
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:34,734
Now, I know we don't have
a lot of flowers, but…

32
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,745
but the ones we got
are different, dynamic, and…

33
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:38,828
weird!

34
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,810
The flowers, you,
your brother, all weird.

35
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,946
That's why no one wants you around.

36
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:47,630
Weird. Weird. Weird.
All of it, weird.

37
00:03:49,946 --> 00:03:52,079
Well, ed, we gave it a shot.

38
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:53,667
I thought they were nice.

39
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:56,675
It's fine. I don't care what Mali thinks.

40
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:58,641
What are you talking about?

41
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:00,339
You care what everybody thinks.

42
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:04,892
Not right now, because
I've got a big surprise for you.

43
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:09,365
Ooh, a hat thing!

44
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,509
It's not a hat thing.

45
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,424
It's an official head dress
for my new job.

46
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:16,953
When we all march up the mountain
for the flower festival,

47
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:20,480
I'll be in one
of the most important spots,

48
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:22,600
the very back.

49
00:04:22,749 --> 00:04:25,057
Because I've been chosen to be,

50
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,936
the friend at the end.

51
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:31,279
But, the back end.

52
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,892
- It's a start.
- No, it's the opposite. It's the finish.

53
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:36,329
- Still, it's an honor.
- How were you selected?

54
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,326
- Randomly.
- Well, I'm happy for you.

55
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,283
You know, what would make it
even better?

56
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,791
Op, I love you.

57
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:47,712
But this is my final chance to make a good
impression with rest of the flummels.

58
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:51,083
And don't take this
the wrong way, but please,

59
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:52,892
just try not to ruin this for me.

60
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:54,463
What's that supposed to mean?

61
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:57,424
Whenever you help, things tend to

62
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,980
- unravel.
- Uh, me?

63
00:04:59,063 --> 00:05:00,594
- You. Always.
- Never.

64
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,228
Just give me one example.

65
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,625
Waterfall fail. Mango avalanche.

66
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,333
Rock in the hole. The great fire.

67
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:09,352
The greater fire. Mud for dinner.

68
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,515
Tree skies. The burpening.

69
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,286
Fish for hands. The ring thing.

70
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,495
Bee tornado.
Bee tornado ii: The tropical swarm.

71
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:21,275
And of course, coconut Charlie
and the jackfruit jamband.

72
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:23,057
So, we've had our ups and downs.

73
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,240
Mainly downs.

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,177
But think of those
sweet-sweet occasional ups.

75
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,151
And besides, you need
to stop living in the past.

76
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:33,479
And look to the future.

77
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:36,035
Hi, uh, op?

78
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:39,650
I just wanted to say
I like that spin move you do.

79
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:42,515
Oh, thanks! I call it
the op-pop.

80
00:05:42,654 --> 00:05:44,938
- I can teach you if you want.
- You could?

81
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,920
Sure, just do what I do.

82
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:59,164
Bo, what have I told you
about wandering off?

83
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,300
Not to.

84
00:06:01,383 --> 00:06:05,397
Right, especially in this direction.

85
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,726
Fred, you look good,
you've been working out?

86
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,192
Did you change your fur back home?

87
00:06:18,938 --> 00:06:20,886
Holes front, everybody.

88
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:23,306
- All right.
- Yeah, sure.

89
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:28,757
Get ready to give your undivided attention
to the roundest guy around,

90
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,925
the king ring of our hoop troop.

91
00:06:31,008 --> 00:06:33,369
Ja-ja-ja-jepson!

92
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:38,081
Hey, thank you, Mali.
Thanks a bunch, great stuff.

93
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,410
Hey everybody, all right, a little story
just before we begin.

94
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:44,671
Last night, I was doing some thinking.
I was doing some math.

95
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:49,084
And I realized, hey-hey,
this is the 100th flower festival.

96
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,821
Such a round number. Get it?

97
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,590
That guy gets it,
I like that guy.

98
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:03,862
So anywho, I've decided our theme this year
just like every other year is…

99
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,066
flowers.

100
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:07,640
Boom!

101
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:16,439
All right, cheer time is over.

102
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,974
All right!

103
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,511
And as always,

104
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:22,332
I and the grand flower flummel

105
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:25,322
will lead us right to
the top of the mountain

106
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:26,936
to celebrate.

107
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,704
And we will all be there.

108
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:30,776
Old flummels and young flummels.

109
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:33,039
Big flummels and small flummels.

110
00:07:33,123 --> 00:07:34,703
Flummels who love the beach.

111
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:38,974
But especially the part
where the sand is a little firmer.

112
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,078
I told you that branch wouldn't hold us.

113
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,895
I don't remember you saying that.

114
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,411
I thought it.

115
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:54,087
Don't tell me. The weirdos.

116
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:04,447
Great, we've been demoted
to crab poking.

117
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,272
Well, hey, at least you still have
your job as the.

118
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,609
Buddy in the back.

119
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:10,372
Friend at the end.

120
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:12,500
And with that head-dress

121
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,697
you're gonna be asked
for a lot of dances.

122
00:08:16,472 --> 00:08:17,548
I couldn't.

123
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,653
I get nervous talking to girls
that aren't you.

124
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,161
I can't even talk to vinny
since he grew his hair long.

125
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,792
'Sup.

126
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:27,373
Hey, what's ha... looking good.

127
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:30,731
Hey, look, it's Wally!

128
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,097
- Wally? Really, now?
- Hey, Wally?

129
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,397
Hey, Wally?

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,036
We have crabs to poke.

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,724
Get over here, buddy.

132
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,838
I wanna hear what's been happening.

133
00:08:39,957 --> 00:08:41,673
Huh? Ho-ho.

134
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,834
Hey, op, I'm coming, don't you worry.

135
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:48,470
We haven't talked since yesterday,
so, there's a lot to catch up on.

136
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:50,873
- First of all…
- he's coming in pretty hot.

137
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,890
Towards the beach, all right?
Where all the flummels are working.

138
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:56,473
Ah, you're right.
Better shoo them off a bit.

139
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:58,636
…let's be honest,
it's all just… it's swimming.

140
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:02,213
You can't call it a school
and expect kids to be excited about it.

141
00:09:02,297 --> 00:09:03,878
That's the same thing.

142
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,152
No, that was waving.
This is a shoo-ing motion.

143
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,277
No, it isn't.

144
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,730
This is a shoo-ing motion, more like this.

145
00:09:10,813 --> 00:09:13,519
And we're done.

146
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,555
Great work, everybody.

147
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,950
And some great modeling, Kim.

148
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,465
And guess what,
Mr. Seahorse is having a baby.

149
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,092
- It's shoo-ing motion.
- That's what I'm doing.

150
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,426
No, that's waving.

151
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:29,115
Drinking sea water makes you go crazy,
but what else am I supposed to drink?

152
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,524
- Waving.
- Shoo-ing.

153
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,087
That's so waving.

154
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,829
- I'm shoo-ing.
- Waving. Shoo...

155
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,016
I know blabber is just what's it's called.

156
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,304
But that doesn't make it
any less hurtful.

157
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,642
Save the grand flower flummel!

158
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:09,560
Random question, were you guys
waving or shoo-ing?

159
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,910
Hi, I can explain.

160
00:10:20,994 --> 00:10:23,546
Oh, you two really did it this time.

161
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,158
You really did…

162
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,784
hey, where is your brother?

163
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,573
I really hope
jepson didn't see that.

164
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,831
Jepson!

165
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:54,133
You know, I'm patient.
Oh, yes, I am.

166
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,823
But sometimes a leader has to lead.

167
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:59,238
And that is why, op and ed,

168
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:02,580
you are forbidden
from coming to the flower festival.

169
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,788
While we go up the mountain,

170
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:09,547
why don't you two take some time
and think about what you did

171
00:11:09,757 --> 00:11:11,747
on desolation rock?

172
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:21,381
Oh, that's why it's called that.

173
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:23,192
Let's go, everybody.

174
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:29,216
And there goes my last chance to belong.

175
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,461
Listen, ed, I know this seems bad,

176
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:36,240
- but we can…
- don't bother.

177
00:11:36,324 --> 00:11:39,082
It's fine, I'm not mad,
I'm just…

178
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:41,458
used to it.

179
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,078
Booby.

180
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,576
Not now.

181
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,127
I've got an idea.

182
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:09,063
How do you talk me into these things?

183
00:12:09,565 --> 00:12:11,641
I finally understand
why this is called

184
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:14,494
the forbidden to go out there,
it's way too dangerous zone.

185
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,431
Look, we destroyed all the flowers, right?

186
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:19,764
So, we're gonna get more flowers
no one's ever seen before.

187
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,652
And they'll have no choice
but to forgive us.

188
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:24,022
Now, come on.
It's just a little bit further.

189
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:26,291
Op, oh, no.

190
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,755
I knew it. Now I'm scared.
Stuck. Alone.

191
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:33,571
- And a little overweight.
- What's wrong?

192
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,033
Oh, you're alive!

193
00:12:35,116 --> 00:12:37,971
Okay, I was just making small talk.

194
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,584
Looks like rain. No it doesn't.

195
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:40,992
- Look at this one.
- Easy.

196
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:43,036
- Oh and this one.
- Easy does it.

197
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,383
Whoa, I've never even seen
this flower before.

198
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:46,508
I got this.

199
00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:49,116
- That means I get to name it.
- No, I don't got this.

200
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,379
Oppadils. No, that's too bad.

201
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:53,702
Oppareniums magnolia…

202
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:55,634
these are really nice.

203
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,977
You know what,
this may actually work.

204
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,200
For sure this is totally gonna whoa…

205
00:13:18,478 --> 00:13:20,053
Don't even think about it.

206
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,515
Just a little more, ed.

207
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,006
There is no more.

208
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:27,765
Okay, okay. Forget it.
I think I can reach it.

209
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:29,446
This is my life.

210
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:36,932
What is that?

211
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,383
What is that?

212
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,111
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

213
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,189
Yes, and it's amazing!

214
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:51,887
It is amazing!

215
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:53,261
What do you think it is?

216
00:13:53,345 --> 00:13:56,124
No idea. I've never seen
anything like it.

217
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,244
Do you think it's some kind
of a new whale?

218
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,327
Whale?

219
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:01,858
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

220
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,514
- What are you talking about?
- Op,

221
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,328
what are you talking about?

222
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:09,614
I'm talking about this
gorgeous, glowing, swirling...

223
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:12,339
Oh, okay. Nothing. Ed, help.
Pull me up.

224
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,130
Arms tired, from poking crabs.

225
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,664
Booby.

226
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,702
Booby.

227
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:35,864
Oh, boy.

228
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,967
What is this?!

229
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,376
Help me!

230
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,773
Oh, wow, what the… wow.

231
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:14,250
- Okay.
- Ed, ed, relax.

232
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,253
Think about it. We went into a flower
on flummel island

233
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,951
then we came out of a flower
in this place.

234
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,287
Do you know what that means?

235
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:23,991
Yes. Yes.

236
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:25,742
No, I don't. Do you?

237
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:29,526
No. But it's still pretty wild though.

238
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:43,312
Wait here.

239
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,120
Something's stuck.

240
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,953
Where are my mid-distance bifocals?

241
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:24,020
Nice reflexes.

242
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:34,751
Aww, cute!

243
00:16:36,214 --> 00:16:38,939
Aww, really cute!

244
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:43,930
Less cute.

245
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,953
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Stop!

246
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:59,794
What is happening?
How did flower picking turn into…

247
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:01,424
whatever this is?

248
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:03,721
Don't worry. I can fix this.

249
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:06,364
Yeah? Fix that.

250
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,596
Fix it?

251
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,639
It's amazing!

252
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,197
Amazing?

253
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,562
Where are you going?

254
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:29,528
That mount you're on is moving.

255
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,880
Ed?

256
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:41,857
Op!

257
00:17:56,503 --> 00:17:58,819
Op! Op!

258
00:18:22,276 --> 00:18:23,975
Seems about right.

259
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:27,080
Thanks for the lift.

260
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:28,738
Oh, hey!

261
00:18:28,822 --> 00:18:30,032
Isn't this place great?

262
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:33,585
We should have never left
desolation rock.

263
00:18:35,642 --> 00:18:37,011
Come on.

264
00:18:37,661 --> 00:18:40,202
Your ideas have cost us
nothing but trouble.

265
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,290
So, we are doing things my way.

266
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,433
The ed way.

267
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,367
What are you?

268
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:51,050
You're the cutest things
I've ever seen.

269
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,311
Do you wanna come home
and marry my Dolly?

270
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:55,491
And you could marry my cat.

271
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,098
Why do you get the cat?

272
00:18:58,267 --> 00:18:59,348
I want the cat.

273
00:19:04,524 --> 00:19:05,859
Ah, it's you again!

274
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,620
You got it all wrong.

275
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:08,978
I'm here to help you guys.

276
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:11,087
Sorry, for being so rude
back at the house.

277
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:13,787
We dogs are very territorial,
you know?

278
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,283
No. We don't know.

279
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:16,285
We don't know anything.

280
00:19:16,369 --> 00:19:18,059
Well, let's start with the basics then.

281
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:20,582
I'm clarance, and I'm a dog.

282
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:21,913
Ruff ruff.

283
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:25,242
Well, hi, clarance. I'm op
and this is ed, and we're…

284
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:26,962
flummels.

285
00:19:29,028 --> 00:19:31,001
We'll save you.

286
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,398
Guys? Wait, no, no,
you don't understand.

287
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:40,334
Let me show you.

288
00:19:42,701 --> 00:19:45,575
Cute little doggie, here you go.

289
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:49,179
He's gonna eat a flummel.

290
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:52,483
You monster, we won't let you die brother.

291
00:19:52,962 --> 00:19:54,405
I'm not getting a pulse.

292
00:19:58,996 --> 00:20:01,073
Guys, guys, it's just a doughnut.

293
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:05,022
Food, refined sugar, trans fats.

294
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,459
I have to admit,

295
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,253
we're pretty delicious.

296
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,212
Um, right?

297
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,887
I imagine you guys have
a few questions.

298
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:21,986
Yeah, like where are we?

299
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,282
You should probably ask:
"When are we?"

300
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,933
No, we're gonna stick with
"where are we?"

301
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:31,122
Yeah, where?

302
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:33,574
Seriously, you should ask "when."
Seriously.

303
00:20:34,546 --> 00:20:35,785
No. Where?

304
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,229
Yeah, I'm good with "where"?

305
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,911
This will take some visual aid.

306
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:42,734
Oh I know just a place
to get you some answers. Follow me.

307
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:46,963
Yeah, this way.

308
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:54,299
Oh, ed, stop.

309
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:56,121
Become a member before it's too late!

310
00:20:56,204 --> 00:20:57,514
I don't know what these are,

311
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,912
but I finally feel like
we belong to something.

312
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,023
Member

313
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:16,199
This place is kinda spooky.

314
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,108
Makes my skin crawl.

315
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:19,758
No offense.

316
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:22,178
Stay with the group.

317
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:23,782
Us'es.

318
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:26,842
- What are we looking at here?
- We found us'es.

319
00:21:26,947 --> 00:21:28,555
Flummels.

320
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:37,251
And as usual
they are ignoring us.

321
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:40,225
Hey, it's Charlie. What's up?

322
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:50,642
So, what's going on here?

323
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,629
Guys, guys, relax.
They are just models.

324
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,832
Fakes.

325
00:21:54,915 --> 00:22:00,087
This is the hall of extinct creatures.

326
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:03,554
I mean the hall of extinct creatures.

327
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,455
What does extinct mean?

328
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:07,838
I have no idea.

329
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:09,552
- I just joined.
- Well…

330
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:11,339
you see, it began with…

331
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:14,064
I guess I could… you know what,
I just let this thing do it.

332
00:22:16,006 --> 00:22:19,294
Flummels, the whole story.

333
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:24,232
A ship cuts across the sea
to a destinies unknown.

334
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:26,766
That's the thing I saw
before we fell into the flower.

335
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,814
We are the beagle
of his majesty's royal fleet.

336
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:31,911
That's Charles Darwin.

337
00:22:31,995 --> 00:22:34,983
Author of "on the origin of species."

338
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:38,417
Well, not yet. Right now,
I'm studying the galapagos

339
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:41,934
where I've just discovered
a previously unknown island.

340
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:43,122
Home.

341
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:44,575
Unfortunately,

342
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:47,631
the island volcano erupted
before they got there.

343
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:49,286
No home?

344
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:53,330
All that was left
was a single sliver of beach.

345
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,060
That's not even the best part
of the beach.

346
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:57,144
On the island

347
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:01,282
Darwin discovered the remains
of an unusual ring-shaped animal.

348
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:04,678
<i>He called flummelius hidelia.</i>

349
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,895
Or flummels.

350
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,664
He theorized that the entire flummel
species was destroyed by the volcano.

351
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:15,555
<i>Flummelius hidelia was no more.</i>

352
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,844
Dead. Gone. Finished.

353
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,514
Extinct!

354
00:23:20,907 --> 00:23:22,912
Extinct?

355
00:23:25,128 --> 00:23:26,381
Wait.

356
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:29,071
All the flummels gone?

357
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:31,762
How did this happen?
It doesn't make any sense.

358
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:34,671
Everyone was just fine.
We were just there.

359
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:36,535
Unless,

360
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,153
we weren't just there.

361
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,509
Okay, Clarence, I'll ask.

362
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:41,639
What…

363
00:23:52,923 --> 00:23:54,473
When are we?

364
00:23:56,873 --> 00:24:00,829
So, we're in the future
in a place called Shanghai

365
00:24:00,912 --> 00:24:03,507
and all of the other flummels are gone?

366
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,790
No more jepson?

367
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:05,998
No more little Bo?

368
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,525
No more that guy
whose name we don't know.

369
00:24:09,097 --> 00:24:11,305
Normally, I'd be excited
that we just rhymed.

370
00:24:11,388 --> 00:24:13,762
Don't worry, well… worry a little.

371
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:16,324
But either way, stick with the dog.

372
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,507
That's sun, Dr. Chung's wife.

373
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,009
Nice lady, really knows
how to scratch a tummy.

374
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:28,169
Dr. Chung discovered these flowers
and used them to travel through time

375
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:30,439
before he got lost somehow

376
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:31,837
somewhere.

377
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:36,280
Anyway, the answer to all your problems
is right through here. So, come on.

378
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:37,537
Whoa, whoa,

379
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:39,349
I'm not going
through that thing again.

380
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:41,087
What if we end up Dr. Chung'ed?

381
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:43,734
Hey, you're in good hands.

382
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:46,034
Okay, paws, but front paws.

383
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:50,348
Get it? Thanks to me sun hasn't even
noticed that Dr. Chung is missing.

384
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,940
I'm convinced. Let's go.

385
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:11,964
Welcome to the time terminal.

386
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:17,525
A place neither in the past,
nor the future.

387
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:20,284
Dr. Chung discovered
that each one of these portals

388
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,539
leads to a different time flower
somewhere in history.

389
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,474
Allow me to demonstrate.

390
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,827
Let's try this one, Austria, 1787.

391
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,354
That's Mozart, the musical genius.

392
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:41,153
Now, check this out.

393
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:44,487
<i>Was ist das?</i>

394
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,037
And now he's just showing off.

395
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,181
All we have to do is find the seed
that activates the galapagos portal

396
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,792
and you'll be on your way home.

397
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,796
Home? To a volcanic explosion?

398
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:04,452
No. Home before the volcanic explosion,
so we can warn everyone.

399
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:05,656
Warn them?

400
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:08,452
How are the flummels
gonna trust us with their lives

401
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,284
when they don't even trust us
with their flowers?

402
00:26:11,423 --> 00:26:14,180
Remember when I told you
to look to the future?

403
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:15,941
This is that future

404
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:20,425
because we're the only ones
who can save the flummels from extinction.

405
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:23,662
So, forget fitting in.
We're gonna stand out.

406
00:26:23,877 --> 00:26:25,361
As heroes.

407
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:27,419
Okay.

408
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,263
Okay, but if we're gonna do this,

409
00:26:29,347 --> 00:26:30,562
we have to do it right.

410
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:31,723
Let's concentrate,

411
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:35,437
take our time, carefully consider
our every move.

412
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:38,296
Absolutely, it's all about focus.

413
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,303
Totally not this one.

414
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,784
Not this one or this one.

415
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:49,638
You're doing it all wrong.

416
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:51,944
No, actually, I'm doing it all right.

417
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,930
Oh, here it is, galapagos, 1835.

418
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,477
Listen, I am…

419
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:01,425
well, dang!

420
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:06,157
I found it. I found the seed for…

421
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,729
maybe we are supposed to be extinct.

422
00:27:09,812 --> 00:27:12,024
Not good, not good.

423
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:20,304
- Help!
- Clarance?

424
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,026
Where am I? This is horrible.

425
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:43,732
I gotta get outta here.

426
00:27:43,815 --> 00:27:48,888
And who are you? I'm earnest shackleton,
head of the earnest shackleton expedition.

427
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:51,257
Now, don't worry. You're with friends.

428
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,978
Part of a team. Team earnest shackleton.

429
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:56,608
Named after me, earnest shackleton.

430
00:27:56,691 --> 00:27:57,857
Good dog.

431
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,525
Earnest shackleton.

432
00:28:00,101 --> 00:28:02,834
Hello, I'm clarance, and you are?

433
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:05,773
We're only here to serve master.

434
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,961
Okay, maybe we'll do names later.

435
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:17,187
- Intruders!
- Sanitize them!

436
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:18,626
Tolerable disinfectant

437
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,531
what are you two?
Monsters? Space aliens?

438
00:28:23,513 --> 00:28:24,746
Elves.

439
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,202
- Are you two elves?
- We are none of those things.

440
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,081
We're op and ed, we're…

441
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:31,132
they appear to be a pair of flummels,

442
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:33,108
<i>flummelius hidelia to be exact.</i>

443
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:35,932
<i>The Germans referred to them
as kugelfeinege…</i>

444
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:39,001
they all went extinct
in the early 19th century.

445
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,627
My name is dottie, I'm a dodo bird.

446
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:44,849
My anxious friend here is burnie,
and he is a tasmanian tiger.

447
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,296
And Alma is a macrauchenia.

448
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:50,553
Just Alma, it's fine.

449
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,727
Who are these guys?

450
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,853
They're new? And small and new?

451
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:02,045
New guys.

452
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:06,667
And this is hoss, he's from the cretaceous
period, so he's millions of years old.

453
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:08,349
But also, he's only five.

454
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:10,309
Are these new extinctables?

455
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:12,154
What are extinctables?

456
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:13,040
We are, mate.

457
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:15,252
We'll be happy to tell you
all about everything.

458
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:18,241
We have a nice glossy brochure or…

459
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,600
we could sing a song.

460
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:22,858
- Brochure sounds great.
- Brochure.

461
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,571
Song it is.

462

495
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:18,091
Wow, that wasn't terrible.

496
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:21,419
You know, I feel clarance
would've really gotten a kick out of that.

497
00:31:21,502 --> 00:31:25,862
Wait. Clarance clarance?

498
00:31:28,735 --> 00:31:30,183
What did you do?

499
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:35,921
It all happened so fast.
The portals just went crazy

500
00:31:36,376 --> 00:31:38,810
and then clarance flew away.

501
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:40,664
Like dogs do.

502
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,324
This is a new record, op.

503
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:45,719
We've been here for 10 minutes
and everybody already hates us.

504
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:47,864
Oh, hate is a strong word.

505
00:31:50,095 --> 00:31:51,929
It's fine. It will all be fine.

506
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:54,603
Ed and I will get clarance
and the seed back.

507
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:03,398
Hate to break it to you, but there's no
telling where or when clarance might be.

508
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:08,296
Not to mention he may be taken
by body snatchers, boogeyman, cyclopes.

509
00:32:08,379 --> 00:32:12,090
Burnie… the point is,
clarance could be anywhere, literally.

510
00:32:12,174 --> 00:32:16,291
Well, not anywhere, doesn't he have
to be in one of those places?

511
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,288
Let me get this straight.

512
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,639
You're suggesting you randomly journey

513
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:23,911
to these dozens of unknown
and dangerous places

514
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:27,105
in hopes of stumbling across clarance
by sheer dumb luck?

515
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:30,362
Sounds like a plan to me.
Let's go find that dog.

516
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:33,595
Wait, did she say "dangerous"?
Did you say "dangerous"?

517
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:36,026
Dangerous is just another word for heroic.

518
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,422
Well, they're dead.

519
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:47,681
Hello, sir. Have you seen
a cute little doggy around here?

520
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,504
Real fluffy, about yey high.

521
00:33:02,562 --> 00:33:04,339
Oki dok. We're done here.

522
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,981
Crocky. You're not dead.

523
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:16,161
Pay up.

524
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:20,283
No sign of clarance,
and we almost got killed.

525
00:33:20,454 --> 00:33:22,217
This is why I don't like to travel.

526
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,714
Come on, ed. We've got
a lot more places to check,

527
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,094
so let's not get distracted.

528
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:28,359
My face.

529
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:34,311
Hey, oh, look it's me! Hi, me!

530
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:36,403
Oh, no, there's hole right though me.

531
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:39,008
Just messing. I know that's how I look.

532
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,199
Wow, your sister really is...

533
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:43,071
Bound to be the eventual death of me?

534
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,265
I was going to say energetic.

535
00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:48,297
Okay, ed. I've got a great feeling
about this next portal.

536
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:50,344
- Do you trust me?
- No.

537
00:34:18,672 --> 00:34:19,831
O. Wright

538
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,862
Titanic London

539
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:29,667
Atlantic ocean, 1911

540
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:46,838
Menlo park, 1876

541
00:34:58,561 --> 00:34:59,735
Cupertino, 1976

542
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:14,269
Khotkovo

543
00:35:18,323 --> 00:35:21,045
that lady really didn't us
trying on her hat.

544
00:35:21,434 --> 00:35:22,288
You think?

545
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,288
Wow, Cleopatra's crown.

546
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,857
History must be a non-stop adventure.

547
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:29,137
What's it like out there?

548
00:35:29,221 --> 00:35:32,616
It's amazing. Each place
is more exciting than the last.

549
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:34,189
And more dangerous.

550
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:35,739
Listen to this one, hoss.

551
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,567
As I've told you before you do not want
to leave here where it's safe.

552
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:43,451
And op, he's just a kid.

553
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:46,490
You should stop putting ideas in his head.

554
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:51,472
But I want ideas in my head.
I'm so cooked up in here.

555
00:35:51,695 --> 00:35:54,006
I know what will knock
the glum right out of you.

556
00:35:54,478 --> 00:35:57,984
Live, from inside of Dr. Chung's
mobile greenhouse.

557
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:02,205
It's burnie, the down under wonder.

558
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,457
We got great seats.

559
00:36:05,813 --> 00:36:09,319
First, I'll need a common household item.

560
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,501
Now, I place the object
between the two time flowers.

561
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:17,041
And utter the magic words.

562
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,744
Cristo, jingo cwalabingo.♪♪

563
00:36:21,866 --> 00:36:23,559
Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

564
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:27,653
Easy, dumbo, it'll be back in…
three. Two. One.

565
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,185
And…

566
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,115
how did you do that?

567
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:34,906
A magician never reveals his secrets.

568
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:38,517
The emerging of two time flowers
causes an extremely powerful arc

569
00:36:38,601 --> 00:36:41,876
that disassembles the atoms of an item,
sends them into a time loop,

570
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:44,731
then reassembles the item
in a different point in time.

571
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:46,378
Magic!

572
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,459
Thank you.

573
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,983
What, what? What is it?

574
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:58,162
No worries.

575
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:04,344
Hey, you two?

576
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,135
Wake up.

577
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:10,206
We only wake for master.
All we do we do for master.

578
00:37:10,367 --> 00:37:13,750
Right, right, master. Well… i…

579
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:18,869
I think I heard master say you two
should snap my leash so I can go free.

580
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:22,131
As master wishes.

581
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,253
Stop! The master says "stop."

582
00:37:32,302 --> 00:37:34,003
This did not go how I hoped.

583
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,847
Clarance, where are you?

584
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,145
- I don't see him, op.
- Me neither.

585
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,148
Whoa, but I do see a pretty good wall.

586
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,414
On second thought, a great wall.

587
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:01,295
What are they?

588
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:05,282
They're sky flowers.

589
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:10,685
Imagine if we brought these
back to the flummels.

590
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:14,102
Hey, you're smiling.

591
00:38:14,447 --> 00:38:16,377
You're actually enjoying yourself.

592
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:18,508
No, I'm not.

593
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:22,713
We have a lot of mess ahead of us.
And you keep making the mess messier.

594
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:24,931
You are a mess maker.

595
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:29,150
I know. I'm sorry.

596
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:31,162
What's wrong with me?

597
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:36,212
There's nothing wrong with you.
You just don't think things through.

598
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:38,769
I mean, we've been lucky so far.

599
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:41,273
But one of these days
you gonna get someone hurt.

600
00:38:41,391 --> 00:38:43,240
Me, probably.

601
00:38:44,027 --> 00:38:46,798
You're right. But, I'm gonna be better.

602
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,796
From now on, we don't do anything
unless we're both on board.

603
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:55,187
- You promise?
- I promise.

604
00:38:55,889 --> 00:38:57,244
Okay. Okay.

605
00:38:59,245 --> 00:39:00,682
I'll hold you to that.

606
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:07,174
You know, this is nice.
Finally a chance to relax.

607
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:11,217
Spoke too soon.

608
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:26,157
It's been a while.
You do think they're okay out there?

609
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,422
I'm sure they're fine.

610
00:39:28,637 --> 00:39:29,894
R.i.p. Flummels

611
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:40,311
You're alive!

612
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:45,191
Barely. Those sky flowers
tried to kill us.

613
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,350
These are fireworks.
The Chinese invented them.

614
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:51,526
They also invented
the gun powder inside them.

615
00:39:51,609 --> 00:39:54,880
They came from the qianlong coronation.

616
00:39:55,056 --> 00:39:59,084
You must have been in China, 1736.

617
00:39:59,332 --> 00:40:02,423
So, where are you two going next?

618
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:04,640
How about this one?

619
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,060
How about this one?

620
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,835
If that's the one you want then I love it.

621
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,149
Thank you.

622
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:14,329
Let's hope it's the right one
for the flummel's sake.

623
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:17,670
They have no idea
our entire species is doomed.

624
00:40:18,774 --> 00:40:19,904
We're doomed!

625
00:40:20,014 --> 00:40:22,378
We've lost our dj. Where's vinny?

626
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,164
Hey, dudes. Sorry I'm late.

627
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:27,937
Oh, crisis averted.

628
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,242
My face.

629
00:40:41,326 --> 00:40:42,930
The Ernest shackleton expedition 1915

630
00:40:46,538 --> 00:40:47,580
clarance!

631
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:50,062
Clarance!

632
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,785
I can't believe you guys found me.

633
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:56,536
You're better explorers
that this shackleton guy.

634
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:01,641
Ernest shackleton, ugh.

635
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:05,581
Oh, you'll be happy to know.
I kept this safe.

636
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,303
There's just one small problem.

637
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,053
I see.

638
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:14,075
I have a plan.

639
00:41:14,158 --> 00:41:16,338
- Op has a plan.
- Good, what's the plan?

640
00:41:16,422 --> 00:41:17,770
Yeah, what's the plan?

641
00:41:20,117 --> 00:41:21,862
And she's gone.

642
00:41:21,998 --> 00:41:23,896
Did she just abandon us?

643
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:27,066
No, no. She wouldn't abandon us.
We just talked about this…

644
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:31,983
op just promised me that she wouldn't do
this kind of thing anymore, so, no.

645
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,624
She'll be back.
She's probably just gonna…

646
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:37,732
okay, she might have abandoned us.

647
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,513
Op runs off and I'm left pounding a rock.

648
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:46,062
I should've known!

649
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:50,385
What's this doing here?

650
00:41:55,785 --> 00:41:58,095
- Oh, no.
- To the rescue!

651
00:41:58,178 --> 00:41:59,892
He's coming for the toy.

652
00:42:12,584 --> 00:42:14,300
Everything's cold.

653
00:42:14,675 --> 00:42:16,432
This is fun!

654
00:42:16,532 --> 00:42:18,848
Op, what are you doing?

655
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:21,369
Hoss, see that shiny necklace on clarance?

656
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:22,891
Bite it.

657
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:31,121
You broke master's chain.
No one betrays master.

658
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:34,979
This isn't fun anymore.

659
00:42:35,515 --> 00:42:38,441
- We gotta run!
- Let's go, hoss.

660
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,751
Clarance, no!

661
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:48,208
The seed!

662
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:54,757
We can't back home without that seed.
Hoss, circle back around.

663
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,767
No, it's too dangerous.

664
00:42:56,851 --> 00:42:58,094
I'm scared.

665
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:00,025
Turn around, hoss. Now!

666
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:02,351
I got you.

667
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:07,792
Come on.

668
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:12,623
Got it! Back into the time flower, hoss.
And step on.

669
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:21,754
Almost there.

670
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,160
Do you know how to play this game?

671
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:38,578
We're playing a game?

672
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:40,335
Hey, have you guys seen hoss?

673
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:45,596
- It's clarance!
- Clarance.

674
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:46,846
You may wanna move.

675
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:01,253
<i>Was ist das?</i>

676
00:44:02,105 --> 00:44:03,175
<i>Nein! Nein!</i>

677
00:44:07,952 --> 00:44:11,034
Okay. We got clarance.
We got the seed. We…

678
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:14,023
oh, no. Are you okay, hoss?

679
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:17,746
No, he's not okay!
You almost got him extinct!

680
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,780
Not to mention the rest of us.

681
00:44:20,097 --> 00:44:21,152
But I didn't think...

682
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:24,361
That's right, you didn't think.
And you didn't listen.

683
00:44:24,445 --> 00:44:27,267
Even thought you looked me in the eye

684
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:31,642
and promised me that you wouldn't do
anything unless we were both on board.

685
00:44:34,237 --> 00:44:36,317
All this time I thought
I never fit with the flummels

686
00:44:36,353 --> 00:44:38,587
because there's something wrong with me.

687
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:42,123
But now it's clear. It's you.

688
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,172
Wha…

689
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:46,307
- what are you saying?
- I'm saying

690
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:49,092
that my life would be better off
without you!

691
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,796
Hey. He'll be okay. I'm sure
he just needs some time to cool off.

692
00:45:10,035 --> 00:45:11,077
What are you doing?

693
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:14,108
Ed's right. I am the problem.

694
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:16,974
And he is better off without me.

695
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:19,054
All of you are.

696
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,152
But there's one thing I can still do.

697
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,555
- I'm going back to warn the flummels.
- Whoa, whoa…

698
00:45:25,638 --> 00:45:27,610
I'm not sure you should go without ed.

699
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:32,074
I'll just end up causing him more trouble.
And I've caused him enough trouble already.

700
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:35,922
If I can pull this off then ed will have
a community to go home to.

701
00:45:36,363 --> 00:45:38,961
And if I fail, well…

702
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,981
at least I can't hurt him again.

703
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:45,364
The seed, if you please.

704
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,257
Come on!

705
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:04,048
This is not good.

706
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:16,639
You know, you're also a great leader
on the dance floor.

707
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:21,049
Thanks, Mali, you've said that
about five times already.

708
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,028
What is she doing here?

709
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:30,905
Hello, a little reminder,
this is the flower festival.

710
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:34,997
Second reminder, you've been banned
from the flower festival.

711
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:38,822
I don't have time for the whole story.
But I need everyone's attention.

712
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,458
Hey! Do you mind? I am trying
to get my kids to sleep in here.

713
00:46:51,651 --> 00:46:54,596
Oh, now I'm up all night. Thanks!

714
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:59,751
I just returned from the future,
and I learned that in the past,

715
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:01,483
and by past I mean now,

716
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:04,809
our entire species
is about to stop existing.

717
00:47:05,077 --> 00:47:09,376
So, if we're going to live to see
the future we have to do something now,

718
00:47:09,949 --> 00:47:11,358
which is in the past.

719
00:47:14,046 --> 00:47:15,906
I'm sorry, what?

720
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:18,063
We're all about to go extinct.

721
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:20,556
That means die.

722
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:30,041
Easy, easy. It's all right, everyone.
I promise you.

723
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:32,124
Op, you're being ridiculous.

724
00:47:32,228 --> 00:47:34,920
That's why I made this face,
because you're ridiculous.

725
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,969
I'm telling you it's true!
I swear on this conch.

726
00:47:38,195 --> 00:47:40,347
Oh, no! Don't drag me into this.

727
00:47:41,323 --> 00:47:43,672
Look, he's the proof I was in the future.

728
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:57,239
Hey, what about this?

729
00:47:58,906 --> 00:48:02,677
<i>Friend? Friend?</i>

730
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:13,978
Why did I think this would work?

731
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,344
Wow, you really let her have it.

732
00:48:22,798 --> 00:48:25,638
Remind me to never get on your bad side.

733
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:31,102
But don't you think you were maybe
a little bit hard on her?

734
00:48:31,748 --> 00:48:34,046
She is your sister after all.

735
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:38,372
No, it's been like this our whole lives.

736
00:48:38,553 --> 00:48:43,474
Maybe I shouldn't have
said it out loud, but it's true.

737
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:47,331
My life would be much better without her.

738
00:48:47,732 --> 00:48:49,871
Oh, ed, don't say that.

739
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:55,876
This is a place of withouts.

740
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,320
We all live here without our families,
without friends.

741
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:04,661
Sometimes, I think,
without really living at all.

742
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:07,239
But I can tell you this,

743
00:49:07,323 --> 00:49:10,004
life is really tough
when you're all by yourself.

744
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:15,052
<i>Messing, I know that's how I look.</i>

745
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:19,633
<i>Hey, ed.
Ed, are you seeing this?</i>

746
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:29,663
Could someone give me a hand
with this? Anyone?

747
00:49:32,649 --> 00:49:36,581
Hey, check it out.
I'm the friend at the end.

748
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:39,975
Hey, I don't care.

749
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:47,763
Oh, Wally, Wally.

750
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:50,767
Hey, Wally, get over here, buddy.

751
00:49:50,851 --> 00:49:52,997
Wally, where are you going?

752
00:50:01,089 --> 00:50:03,777
Ed? Ed?

753
00:50:04,696 --> 00:50:05,786
You okay?

754
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:07,471
I have to talk to op.

755
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:12,361
Op! Op!

756
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:15,294
Hey, ed, check this out.
You wanna sign my cast?

757
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:16,826
You're the man, hoss!

758
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:20,840
I wanted to ask op if she'd sign it too,
but she left in kind of a hurry.

759
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,213
She left? Left where?

760
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,660
I think she said something
about going home.

761
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:29,774
Going home?

762
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,604
Okay, very interesting presentation.

763
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:45,261
It was a lot to think about.

764
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:48,523
But let's be honest, truthful.
Real truthful.

765
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,798
You never went to the future.

766
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,646
Yes, she did.

767
00:50:53,739 --> 00:50:55,671
And I can attest to it.

768
00:50:57,524 --> 00:51:02,098
- What is that thing?
- I don't know. But sick do.

769
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:04,564
The name is clarance. I'm a dog.

770
00:51:04,648 --> 00:51:08,919
Part poodle, part… that is hard to know,
my mother was very social.

771
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:12,541
You came! You've gotta tell
the flummels they're in trouble.

772
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:16,739
Oh, they most certainly are
in trouble from me.

773
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:22,567
Hey, wait, where are you going?

774
00:51:35,059 --> 00:51:39,010
Okay, so she might have been
telling the truth.

775
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:51,110
Hiya.

776
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:55,888
Why did you do that?
And why did you do this?

777
00:51:56,051 --> 00:52:00,092
Because I hate you.

778
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,913
I hate all flummels. Hate. Hate.

779
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:08,400
Flummels ruined my life!

780
00:52:09,932 --> 00:52:13,057
<i>I was a puppy once. Adorable and sponky.</i>

781
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:15,728
<i>Just waiting for a family to take me home.</i>

782
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:19,992
<i>But, unfortunately,
I lived in a world of flummels.</i>

783
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,648
<i>And flummels
were the most popular pet in the world.</i>

784
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:27,491
<i>Everyone wanted those stupid roundos.</i>

785
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:29,109
<i>Oh, they're cute.</i>

786
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:34,923
<i>I can see through you. I get it.
Nobody wanted a dog with a stomach.</i>

787
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,371
<i>But then, one day, my luck changed.</i>

788
00:52:41,603 --> 00:52:44,332
He's perfect. I'll take him.

789
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,669
<i>I couldn't believe it. This man wanted me.</i>

790
00:52:47,936 --> 00:52:50,749
<i>And he even loved me enough
to give me a name.</i>

791
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:54,401
You're coming home with me, clarance.

792
00:52:57,057 --> 00:53:00,667
<i>I was expecting a warm bed
and a fresh pile of newspapers.</i>

793
00:53:00,787 --> 00:53:02,244
<i>- Sit.
- But instead</i>

794
00:53:02,327 --> 00:53:04,750
<i>- I got something better.
- Good boy.</i>

795
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:07,944
<i>It was then that I realized
I was more than just a pet,</i>

796
00:53:08,459 --> 00:53:10,431
<i>I was a part of science.</i>

797
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,050
<i>That's the top of the fifth inning
as the bambino steps to the play.</i>

798
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:27,009
<i>He's calling a home run shot.</i>

799
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:31,550
<i>He's pointing to a dog on a tiny
little car. Oh, doctor, I don't believe it.</i>

800
00:53:34,264 --> 00:53:35,306
It works!

801
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,144
Now, let's go together.

802
00:53:38,526 --> 00:53:42,386
<i>I loved that man.
I finally felt I belonged somewhere.</i>

803
00:53:42,814 --> 00:53:47,741
<i>Right by his side, adventuring
through time and history together.</i>

804
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,371
<i>But then, one day we traveled to 1835,
to this island.</i>

805
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:11,241
<i>And there we found
a bunch of this stupid napkin rings.</i>

806
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:21,961
<i>Dr. Chung told me this was
when Darwin first discovered flummels,</i>

807
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,533
<i>and introduced them
to the rest of the world.</i>

808
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:28,965
Oh, my goodness, look at you.

809
00:54:29,716 --> 00:54:31,848
Isn't she cute, clarance?

810
00:54:32,095 --> 00:54:36,388
<i>He loved them.
He was gonna love flummels more than me.</i>

811
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:40,097
<i>And then it hit me, I didn't have
to accept the course of history,</i>

812
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:41,805
<i>I could change it.</i>

813
00:54:43,184 --> 00:54:46,858
I think we're all set.
Ready for our next adventure, clarance?

814
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:48,452
Clarance?

815
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,214
Help me!

816
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,016
<i>Yeah, that's right. I turned on my master.</i>

817
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:59,714
<i>I'm a bad guy. That's what we do.</i>

818
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:06,696
<i>I pushed him through a portal
and made sure he could never come back.</i>

819
00:55:09,528 --> 00:55:11,848
<i>After that there was nothing stopping me</i>

820
00:55:11,931 --> 00:55:15,348
<i>from coming back here
and destroying your entire species.</i>

821
00:55:15,726 --> 00:55:19,150
<i>It wasn't a volcano. It was me.</i>

822
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:25,597
<i>Mass explosive device activated.
Now back to some smooth jazz.</i>

823
00:55:33,057 --> 00:55:36,001
<i>It was a quick trip,
but I got a lot done that day.</i>

824
00:55:42,274 --> 00:55:46,587
Three. Two. One. Zero flummels.

825
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:51,623
Mission accomplished.

826
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:57,740
And it was all a done deal
until you two hula hoops showed up.

827
00:55:57,865 --> 00:55:59,570
But it's all about to be fixed

828
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,216
because your brother is back
with the other cowards

829
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,196
who never leave
their precious little time terminal.

830
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,836
And you're not getting off
this island alive.

831
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,945
<i>Flummel extinction in 30 minutes.</i>

832
00:56:11,178 --> 00:56:14,746
Thirty minutes? That's more time
then I though. It's not a lot of time…

833
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,551
yeah, I meant to only set it for three,
and these stupid clumsy paws.

834
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:20,591
You know what? It doesn't matter.

835
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:25,336
You've got a front row seat
to your species and your own extinction.

836
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:27,241
Ta-ta!

837
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:45,135
She's too funny to stay mad at.

838
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:49,006
Look. Look! I found Dr. Chung.

839
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:50,952
What?

840
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:55,800
<i>I've just returned
with the last tasmanian tiger on earth.</i>

841
00:56:55,889 --> 00:56:57,709
<i>It scratched me up pretty good.</i>

842
00:56:59,407 --> 00:57:02,490
What? I don't get into cars
with strangers.

843
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:05,779
<i>And we're recording.</i>

844
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:08,551
<i>Adventure log, June 20th.</i>

845
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:10,748
That's the day he went missing.

846
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:15,039
<i>Today I'm visiting one of my heroes,
the great explorer, zheng he.</i>

847
00:57:15,354 --> 00:57:18,229
<i>He created one of the first
nautical maps ever.</i>

848
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:21,470
<i>Who knows, maybe I'll even
get to see him drawing it up.</i>

849
00:57:22,326 --> 00:57:25,644
<i>Now, off to 1417!</i>

850
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,775
1417. He said 1417.
We know where he went now.

851
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:31,157
<i>Ready for our next adventure, clarance?</i>

852
00:57:31,672 --> 00:57:32,713
<i>Clarance?</i>

853
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:35,171
<i>Help me!</i>

854
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,820
Clarance did that?

855
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:41,749
What kind of conspiracy
in life I didn't see that coming?

856
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:45,152
But we still can save Dr. Chung
if we just use whatever seed...

857
00:57:49,415 --> 00:57:50,457
Or not.

858
00:57:51,123 --> 00:57:53,822
I can't believe we finally know
where Dr. Chung is

859
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:56,209
and there's no way to bring him back.

860
00:57:56,292 --> 00:57:57,709
Unless…

861
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:07,353
1418.

862
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,370
No, no, Dr. Chung said
he was going to 1417. Remember?

863
00:58:13,453 --> 00:58:15,481
Yes, to visit zheng he,

864
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,828
which means he probably joined
his expedition to malacca, 1418,

865
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:22,456
where there's another time flower.

866
00:58:25,344 --> 00:58:28,204
We just need some soft of a beacon
to lead him to it.

867
00:58:28,688 --> 00:58:30,473
Sure, but what?

868
00:58:35,806 --> 00:58:36,719
Perfect.

869
00:58:36,802 --> 00:58:38,698
We should also give him the brochure.

870
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:42,141
We were flummels

871
00:58:50,487 --> 00:58:51,737
- Ed?
- Op.

872
00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:56,766
<i>- I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to...
- Flummel extinction in 15 minutes.</i>

873
00:58:57,415 --> 00:58:59,186
Wait, what's that thing?

874
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,284
What's going on?

875
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,669
A volcano didn't make us extinct,
clarance did with that bomb.

876
00:59:08,864 --> 00:59:13,221
And now he's trapped the others in the cave
and he trapped me against this tree and…

877
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:15,703
well, it's all over.

878
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:23,260
No, it's not over.
Because we both didn't agree that it is.

879
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,112
I was so wrong to say what I said.

880
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:29,025
And I want you to know
that I didn't mean it.

881
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,372
All you've ever done is support me.

882
00:59:31,854 --> 00:59:34,930
And my life would be nothing without you.

883
00:59:35,129 --> 00:59:38,344
What are you talking about.
I can't do anything right.

884
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,449
You know it. I know it. The rest
of the flummels certainly know it...

885
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:43,636
Who cares what the flummels think?

886
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:45,834
I'm serious.

887
00:59:46,017 --> 00:59:50,315
It's been so long worrying about fitting in
with all the other flummels

888
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,878
that I never even noticed
this is where I fit in best.

889
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:56,587
Right here with you.

890
00:59:56,955 --> 00:59:59,510
Come on, I screw up all the time.

891
00:59:59,594 --> 01:00:01,763
But if it weren't for your screw-ups

892
01:00:01,944 --> 01:00:04,628
then we would have never even fallen
through that flower.

893
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:10,045
And thanks to you we have a chance
to rescue our species from extinction.

894
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:13,890
So, what now?

895
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:15,361
I'll tell you what now.

896
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:16,992
We're gonna save the flummels.

897
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:20,702
Because they'd do the same thing for us
if it was the other way around.

898
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:22,635
Probably.

899
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:32,571
You think you can get me out
of this thing?

900
01:00:32,654 --> 01:00:35,494
No problem, there's only
a million combinations here.

901
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:37,959
Nope.

902
01:00:38,797 --> 01:00:39,845
Nope.

903
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,595
Nope.

904
01:00:57,734 --> 01:00:58,928
Thanks, guys.

905
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:01,362
Next time I poke you,
it's gonna be a lot softer.

906
01:01:01,446 --> 01:01:05,508
Come on, op, we're not gonna let
that adorable maniac get away with this.

907
01:01:07,848 --> 01:01:09,278
Hello?

908
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:21,780
Dogs man's best friend

909
01:01:23,954 --> 01:01:25,217
flummels man's best friend

910
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,811
oh, no. It can't be.

911
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,857
Doggy bonze

912
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,028
flummel o's

913
01:01:34,062 --> 01:01:36,701
why won't these flummels just die?

914
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:39,474
Looks like I may need some help.

915
01:01:41,095 --> 01:01:42,136
Big help.

916
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:46,727
How much time before the bomb goes off?

917
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,664
<i>Flummel extinction in nine minutes.</i>

918
01:01:49,782 --> 01:01:53,837
I know it wants to kill is.
But you have to admit, it is helpful.

919
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,963
Don't worry, you'll be long gone by then.

920
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:01,241
What are you gonna do fuzz bowl?
There' only one you and two us'es.

921
01:02:01,419 --> 01:02:03,398
Funny you should mention that.

922
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:08,573
What is that?

923
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:12,424
Meet my cyclops.

924
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:15,874
And in case you were wondering
if ancient Greek monsters were real.

925
01:02:15,972 --> 01:02:16,998
They were.

926
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:19,276
Okay, Greg, you know what to do.

927
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:25,383
No!

928
01:02:43,806 --> 01:02:46,570
Extinctables, ready for action!

929
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:48,209
Burnie.

930
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,261
Hoss.

931
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,397
Alma.

932
01:02:53,154 --> 01:02:54,542
And dottie.

933
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:58,056
I just drove for the first time
and so far I've only hit one pedestrian.

934
01:02:59,032 --> 01:03:01,553
- Guys!
- You left the terminal.

935
01:03:01,636 --> 01:03:04,761
The best decision I've made
in a long time.

936
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:07,354
Or the worst decision.

937
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:09,090
Everybody, back in the truck.

938
01:03:09,337 --> 01:03:11,497
I told ya there were cyclopes.

939
01:03:15,747 --> 01:03:18,052
Dottie, he's following us.

940
01:03:45,226 --> 01:03:48,142
Crocky, that eye makes
for a pretty poor depth perception?

941
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,267
He couldn't hit the broad side of a hoss.

942
01:03:50,351 --> 01:03:52,145
- No offense, hoss.
- None taken.

943
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,077
You're right. Follow my lead.

944
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,063
Hey, cyclops, I bet you can't hit me.
Bet you can't hit me.

945
01:03:58,263 --> 01:04:01,266
Need a target? Hundred points
if you get it to the bulls eye?

946
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,885
Hey, put some sauce on that meat ball.

947
01:04:05,936 --> 01:04:08,147
I'm talking to you, cyclops.

948
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,779
Noodle arms. Noodly, noodly…

949
01:04:10,926 --> 01:04:12,995
those floppy arms like noodles.

950
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:20,281
No, Greg!

951
01:04:20,364 --> 01:04:21,573
It's working.

952
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:31,729
No, stop, you one-eyed idiot.

953
01:04:32,024 --> 01:04:33,357
That's embarrassing.

954
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:39,820
I hate you all.

955
01:04:43,376 --> 01:04:46,772
He is a very very ugly wet-looking dog.

956
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,825
So…

957
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,807
I spent a lot of my cave time
thinking about you two

958
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:01,932
and what I would do
if we ever got out of there alive.

959
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:04,641
I settled on this.

960
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,770
You think maybe we could do this later?

961
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,272
The whole island is about to blow up!

962
01:05:15,598 --> 01:05:19,604
<i>Correct. Flummel extinction
in seven minutes.</i>

963
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:23,065
What do we do, jepson?

964
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:25,861
The only thing we can do.

965
01:05:26,157 --> 01:05:30,365
We ask op and ed,
and then we do whatever they say.

966
01:05:30,981 --> 01:05:32,474
Ed, what do you think?

967
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:35,157
Uh… well…

968
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:44,605
The ship! That's Charles Darwin,
the man from the museum movie!

969
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:47,903
If we make it to the beach
he might be able to save us.

970
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:49,695
- Movie?
- Man?

971
01:05:49,802 --> 01:05:50,844
Save?

972
01:05:51,123 --> 01:05:53,914
Wait, I know what that means.
And it's good.

973
01:05:55,533 --> 01:05:57,137
But what are those?

974
01:05:58,944 --> 01:06:01,972
Jepson, meet the extinctables.

975
01:06:02,788 --> 01:06:04,413
Welcome.

976
01:06:05,197 --> 01:06:07,807
Is something wrong with them?
They don't have any holes.

977
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:23,847
Stay, hoss. Sit.

978
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:26,826
Stay, hoss. Sit!

979
01:06:35,342 --> 01:06:37,202
Jepson, you get everyone to the beach.

980
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:40,691
We'll meet you there after we get this
Darwin guy's attention with sky flowers.

981
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:42,053
Sky flowers?

982
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:43,638
Hit it, burnie!

983
01:06:51,419 --> 01:06:53,467
All right. Go! Go!

984
01:06:57,482 --> 01:07:01,232
- But these flummels haven't been sanitized.
- Don't tell them. Just go!

985
01:07:01,836 --> 01:07:03,706
This is my nightmare.

986
01:07:05,026 --> 01:07:05,866
Wait.

987
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:09,652
I just want to say thanks for everything
and try not to fall to your death.

988
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:12,076
Of course not.
What do you think I am,

989
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,208
a dodo?

990
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:17,311
Here we go!

991
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,612
Oh, no! Oh, no!

992
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:45,569
Oh, because they look like
flowers in the sky.

993
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,012
Hey, tell whoever came up
with that name, great job.

994
01:07:52,424 --> 01:07:54,271
What in a blazes?

995
01:07:58,822 --> 01:08:03,112
My goodness, so many
magnificent creatures!

996
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:05,952
Can we go? Please! Please!

997
01:08:06,846 --> 01:08:09,519
Fine, but this is the last time.

998
01:08:13,842 --> 01:08:16,300
He sees us. Op and ed did it!

999
01:08:16,733 --> 01:08:18,824
Whoa, that felt weird to say.

1000
01:08:25,803 --> 01:08:28,130
Now that's the op and ed I know.

1001
01:08:31,159 --> 01:08:32,087
Oops.

1002
01:08:32,171 --> 01:08:34,525
Yeah, who'd have thought
our aim would be too good?

1003
01:08:45,551 --> 01:08:48,213
Hey there, big fella.
You don't wanna eat us.

1004
01:08:48,297 --> 01:08:50,207
Just eat me. Let ed live.

1005
01:08:53,654 --> 01:08:57,136
That's nice what you said out there.
You know, outside of the mouth.

1006
01:08:57,511 --> 01:08:58,651
I meant it.

1007
01:08:58,779 --> 01:09:01,757
I hope he swallows me first
just so you can live a little longer.

1008
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,771
I hope he swallows me first.

1009
01:09:04,028 --> 01:09:05,790
I will miss you if you're swallowed.

1010
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:08,249
- Ed.
- Oh, op.

1011
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:16,387
We're alive, and smell,
like cyclops breath.

1012
01:09:16,572 --> 01:09:19,592
Behind that big eye
is an even bigger heart.

1013
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:22,313
And by the way, you have a cavity.

1014
01:09:22,397 --> 01:09:26,160
Op, I don't think that ship
is gonna get here in time to save us.

1015
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:28,744
I've got an idea!

1016
01:09:29,056 --> 01:09:30,230
I knew you would.

1017
01:09:33,498 --> 01:09:36,306
So, the cyclops will throw us
to the time flower,

1018
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:37,725
we'll take it to the beach.

1019
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:40,458
And we'll take everyone through it
before the bomb goes off.

1020
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:41,379
Right.

1021
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:43,129
Great repeating the plan, ed.

1022
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,611
Hey, you can do it, big guy.
We believe in you.

1023
01:09:53,546 --> 01:09:54,587
Wait, wait!

1024
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:57,479
Maybe try throwing under hand?

1025
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:18,790
Nice, save, Greg. You're a natural.

1026
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:29,891
Most remarkable.

1027
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,255
If I didn't know any better

1028
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:38,279
I'd say these creatures
are trying to communicate with us.

1029
01:10:38,362 --> 01:10:41,452
Perhaps they're adapting to the changes
around them in order to survive.

1030
01:10:41,535 --> 01:10:45,237
Almost as if… I don't know,
evolving or something?

1031
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:46,883
That's rubbish.

1032
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:52,137
Evolving.

1033
01:10:52,629 --> 01:10:53,671
This way!

1034
01:10:59,909 --> 01:11:01,333
Drop it, fruit loop.

1035
01:11:02,374 --> 01:11:05,841
This island is about to blow,
and there's only gonna be one survivor.

1036
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:09,237
And that's me.
So, hand over that time flower.

1037
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,615
I said hand it over!

1038
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:17,640
Op-pop.

1039
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:18,907
Hey!

1040
01:11:20,328 --> 01:11:21,370
Son of a…

1041
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:24,314
- nice op-pop.
- I learn from the best.

1042
01:11:25,492 --> 01:11:26,937
Get back here!

1043
01:11:58,688 --> 01:12:01,126
Op, look! It's the beach.

1044
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:08,160
Dang, I always forget about this cliff.

1045
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:10,294
End of the lines, heroes.

1046
01:12:11,935 --> 01:12:13,720
Hand over that flower.

1047
01:12:14,442 --> 01:12:16,047
I'm out of ideas.

1048
01:12:18,886 --> 01:12:21,470
I might have one.
And it's kind of an op idea.

1049
01:12:32,742 --> 01:12:36,124
Are you crazy?
You've almost got us killed, ed.

1050
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,302
Oh.

1051
01:12:37,549 --> 01:12:39,736
Is this how I make you feel all the time?

1052
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,747
Pretty much.

1053
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,941
I am so sorry.

1054
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:43,872
Forget it.

1055
01:12:43,955 --> 01:12:45,475
Now, time flowers.

1056
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:47,500
Time flowers?

1057
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,854
How many times did you hit
your head on the way down?

1058
01:12:49,937 --> 01:12:50,979
Five or six.

1059
01:12:57,613 --> 01:13:01,051
Okay, great, now we have three
time flowers, what good does it...

1060
01:13:01,522 --> 01:13:03,438
Burnie's trick!

1061
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:06,683
<i>Flummel extinction in two minutes.</i>

1062
01:13:06,766 --> 01:13:09,503
<i>- Would you shut up?
- Shutting up initiated.</i>

1063
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,524
<i>Shutting up in four minutes.</i>

1064
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,890
They are not gonna make it.

1065
01:13:15,995 --> 01:13:17,439
Neither are we.

1066
01:13:25,019 --> 01:13:27,435
Okay, ed. Try something else.

1067
01:13:27,944 --> 01:13:30,137
Something other
than letting a boat on fire.

1068
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:36,083
- Do you think this will work?
- I have no idea.

1069
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:46,158
No, stop!

1070
01:13:46,241 --> 01:13:48,665
<i>Flummel extinction in 30 seconds.</i>

1071
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:52,602
I got to get this bomb away from me.

1072
01:13:54,578 --> 01:13:56,554
No! Go up! Up!

1073
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:58,189
No!

1074
01:13:59,846 --> 01:14:03,829
- Cristo.
- Jingo cwalabingo.♪♪

1075
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:16,014
<i>Nine. Eight. Seven. Six.</i>

1076
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:20,859
<i>Five. Four. Three. Two.</i>

1077
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:22,255
<i>One.</i>

1078
01:14:35,029 --> 01:14:38,252
- King's casserole!
- Majesty's meatloaf!

1079
01:14:51,029 --> 01:14:53,128
You know, nearly 200 years ago

1080
01:14:53,211 --> 01:14:57,239
my great great grandfather sailed here
with the one and only Charles Darwin.

1081
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:00,597
He claimed that there was
an island here that exploded

1082
01:15:00,717 --> 01:15:02,295
and completely vanished.

1083
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,270
Yeah, I think I had a relative
that did something like that too.

1084
01:15:12,751 --> 01:15:15,800
- King's casserole!
- Majesty's meatloaf!

1085
01:15:21,927 --> 01:15:25,158
We're alive!
Oh, or at least I'm alive.

1086
01:15:25,305 --> 01:15:27,332
Ed, are you alive?

1087
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:29,920
I think so.

1088
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:31,594
What about everyone else?

1089
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,180
- Ed?
- Dottie?

1090
01:15:33,433 --> 01:15:35,662
- Ed! Ed!
- Dottie!

1091
01:15:37,446 --> 01:15:40,671
Hoss! And everybody. You're alive.

1092
01:15:40,922 --> 01:15:42,636
You are all alive.

1093
01:15:46,286 --> 01:15:47,544
We're saved!

1094
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:52,588
Yes, thanks to op and ed
we are de-extincted!

1095
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:54,606
I assume that's a word.

1096
01:15:59,066 --> 01:16:01,844
So, were you worried about me?

1097
01:16:02,703 --> 01:16:04,765
Maybe just a little.

1098
01:16:17,523 --> 01:16:19,364
Hey, I'm uncomfortable.

1099
01:16:19,933 --> 01:16:21,864
I did it. I…

1100
01:16:22,597 --> 01:16:24,110
what exactly did you do?

1101
01:16:24,282 --> 01:16:26,984
Burnie's trick on a grand scale.

1102
01:16:27,264 --> 01:16:28,991
We used every time flower we could find

1103
01:16:29,075 --> 01:16:31,712
to make the whole island disappear
before the bomb went off.

1104
01:16:31,796 --> 01:16:32,837
My trick?

1105
01:16:33,001 --> 01:16:35,806
I was right about the flowers,
and the cyclops.

1106
01:16:36,236 --> 01:16:37,910
What else am I right about?

1107
01:16:38,871 --> 01:16:40,564
This is terrifying.

1108
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:43,306
This isn't over!

1109
01:16:48,652 --> 01:16:50,272
I'll just get back in that flower

1110
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:54,931
and I'll keep trying again and again
until you're all extinct!

1111
01:16:55,075 --> 01:16:56,645
- Sit!
- Sitting.

1112
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:02,457
It worked.

1113
01:17:02,572 --> 01:17:04,423
Dr. Chung made it back!

1114
01:17:06,406 --> 01:17:10,406
You've been a very bad dog, clarance.

1115
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:12,801
- Oh, I haven't started...
- Lay down!

1116
01:17:12,984 --> 01:17:14,394
- When I'm done...
- Beg!

1117
01:17:14,477 --> 01:17:17,505
- You'll feel the wrath of my...
- Play dead.

1118
01:17:18,279 --> 01:17:20,269
Cursed by obedience.

1119
01:17:21,881 --> 01:17:25,847
<i>Familia sedilia, as adorable as ever.</i>

1120
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:28,405
And my extinctables?

1121
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:34,539
It's so good to see you,
and you, and...

1122
01:17:35,511 --> 01:17:36,553
You?

1123
01:17:46,764 --> 01:17:48,590
When are we?

1124
01:17:48,677 --> 01:17:51,809
I think you should be asking when...
Oh.

1125
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:53,648
No, wait. You got it.

1126
01:17:57,053 --> 01:17:59,300
<i>Today we celebrate
the one year anniversary</i>

1127
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:02,047
<i>of the greatest discovery
of the 21st century.</i>

1128
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:05,654
<i>A species once thought extinct, flummels.</i>

1129
01:18:06,221 --> 01:18:10,213
<i>Yes, huggable, loveable,
adorable flummels.</i>

1130
01:18:10,405 --> 01:18:15,064
<i>Brought to us my famed
botanical astrophysicist, Dr. Lee chung.</i>

1131
01:18:17,049 --> 01:18:19,062
I'm so proud of you, Lee.

1132
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:22,659
And you've been so much
more talkative since your discovery.

1133
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:40,378
And she's back.

1134
01:18:40,621 --> 01:18:42,634
How you've been, sis?

1135
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:45,882
Hey, look at you.
Friend at the end again, eh?

1136
01:18:45,965 --> 01:18:49,028
Nope, fellow at the front.

1137
01:18:50,356 --> 01:18:51,861
And all without my help.

1138
01:18:51,945 --> 01:18:54,282
You and Dr. Chung
visit any cool places lately?

1139
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:57,699
You bet we have, it's been
one amazing adventure after another.

1140
01:18:57,788 --> 01:19:00,041
What did you guys
end up doing with clarance?

1141
01:19:00,138 --> 01:19:01,305
He's cooling off.

1142
01:19:02,388 --> 01:19:04,541
No dog should have a master.

1143
01:19:04,637 --> 01:19:08,181
So, on the count of three
I say we tie up shackleton,

1144
01:19:08,264 --> 01:19:10,610
take his ship, and head somewhere warm,

1145
01:19:10,694 --> 01:19:12,562
like cabo.

1146
01:19:14,636 --> 01:19:16,132
Okay, okay, we can change it up.

1147
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:18,258
Fiji? San Diego? Rome?

1148
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:20,584
Paris? They let dogs
in the restaurants there.

1149
01:19:21,692 --> 01:19:24,207
Ready or not, hoss, here I come.

1150
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:30,361
Great job, everyone.
And thanks for helping out, pals.

1151
01:19:32,228 --> 01:19:33,567
Hey, op and ed.

1152
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,969
Well, how do you like
this year's two flower floats?

1153
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,980
- Great!
- I look a little chunky.

1154
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:43,415
I'm sorry your teeth are yellow.
We ran out of white flowers.

1155
01:19:44,938 --> 01:19:48,979
Hey, ed, I have a little surprise for you.
Come with me.

1156
01:19:49,062 --> 01:19:51,383
Oh, yeah, I love surprises.

1157
01:19:51,564 --> 01:19:53,499
Except I just remembered that I don't.

1158
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:55,748
So tell me what it is
so I'm not too surprised.

1159
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:08,634
Don't worry, ed. I'm sure
you have plenty of time to prepare for...

1160
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:15,813
<i>Keep tuned for the post credit scene.</i>

1161
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,909
Op, I really don't know
if I can handle another surprise today.

1162
01:21:25,112 --> 01:21:26,841
Trust me, you gonna love it.

1163
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,287
Hi, I haven't seen you
since what, like 1835?

1164
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:34,634
There's so much to talk about.

1165
01:21:34,773 --> 01:21:37,113
You two keep going.
I'll go get him a glass of water.

1166
01:21:38,305 --> 01:22:38,419
