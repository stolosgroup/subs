3
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,319
<i>Once upon a time a
beautiful young girl grew up</i>

4
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
<i>hidden away in a convent
by the edge of the sea.</i>

5
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:37,827
Marie-Josephe!

6
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,642
Marie-Josephe!

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,119
<i>Her very existence was a secret.</i>

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,120
<i>For she was the King's daughter.</i>

9
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,719
Marie-Josephe!

10
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,760
<i>From a very early age,
she was drawn to the water.</i>

11
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:58,637
<i>Much to the dismay of
the convent's strict nuns</i>

12
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,598
<i>who did their best to shelter her
from the world.</i>

13
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,603
How often have you been
warned not to swim in the sea?

14
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:07,719
Very often.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,239
And to my previous punishments--

16
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,902
Revoking your riding privileges,

17
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:15,623
burning your beloved cello,
none were enough to detour you.

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,119
It is Satan's voice which
calls you to the unholy sea.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,580
No… Abbess, it is
a simple joy of nature.

20
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:26,105
-Silence. Silence, I said!
-It is.

21
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,519
<i>Meanwhile, at the Palace of
Versailles, Marie-Josephe's father,</i>

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,263
<i>King Louis XIV, King of France,</i>

23
00:02:40,344 --> 00:02:43,340
<i>had recently returned
victorious from an expensive war</i>

24
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,444
<i>that had dragged on for years.</i>

25
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,480
Our troops have been fighting
with exceptional skill and courage.

26
00:02:54,251 --> 00:02:56,440
It has been the greatest honor for me

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,010
to stand beside each--

28
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,534
France still had enemies.

29
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:06,497
My King…

30
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:10,039
And that night, the man
also known as the Sun King,

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,640
learned that even he
would not live forever.

32
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Now…

33
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,880
Where was I?

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,640
A few inches to the right,

35
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,715
would have found your heart.

36
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,462
If France loses you,

37
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,119
it would be catastrophic.

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,231
Not to mention lonely for me.

39
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,515
There is a possible solution.

40
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,771
I've been investigating
certain properties…

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
of an organ in a legendary sea creature.

42
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:53,829
A fish?

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,120
That's your solution?

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,840
If the question is the king's mortality,

45
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,877
this creature could hold the key.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,839
<i>And with that, the Sun King
commissioned a risky expedition</i>

47
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,239
<i>to find the
underwater lost City of Atlantis.</i>

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>And its fabled mermaids.</i>

49
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:19,632
<i>Believing they held the key
to life everlasting.</i>

50
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,160
<i>Hold tight o', captain.</i>

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,516
Give me some hand with this.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,956
<i>For this dangerous mission,
a courageous captain</i>

53
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,120
<i>was sent to search the
far reaches of the seas.</i>

54
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:43,720
I think I saw it.

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Due North.

56
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,959
Are you sure?

57
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,279
Only if you believe in the unbelievable.

58
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,560
Ready the barrel!

59
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,040
Ready the barrel.

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,520
Lower the nets!

61
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
Drop the boat, now!

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,160
Fire!

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Fire!

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Heave!

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Heave!

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Up!

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
They're gonna kill us all!

68
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,480
We only need the female.

69
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,600
Let the male go.

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,876
<i>So, Captain Yves De La Croix</i>

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,436
<i>sent word of the amazing
capture back to Versailles,</i>

72
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,288
<i>on the wings of the Royal carrier pigeons.</i>

73
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,919
Fantastic news, Your Majesty!

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,520
De La Croix's ship sails for home.

75
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,880
In possession of the miraculous cargo.

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,919
The coming eclipse is the perfect timing.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,959
The books are clear about these matters.

78
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,338
And specify that the creature
must be sacrificed

79
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:36,492
right as the moon passes
in front of the sun

80
00:06:36,573 --> 00:06:39,479
in order to transfer
its gift of eternal life.

81
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,135
Perhaps we should withhold
our glee, Dr. Labarthe,

82
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:44,839
until we have the proof that
your books are not just fiction.

83
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,556
Relax, father.

84
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:51,919
Surely the doctor wouldn't be risking his
reputation on these outlandish claim

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,344
unless he was feeling very confident.

86
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,331
Dead ahead, Captain!

87
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,922
<i>The King's closest minister</i>

88
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:13,959
<i>had serious doubts about the
doctor's plan for the mermaid.</i>

89
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,079
<i>And as fate would have
it he had just requested</i>

90
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,639
<i>that the King's daughter attend the royal
celebration of the coming solar eclipse.</i>

91
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,519
Father? A response
from the Convent of St Elein.

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,313
Give me the girl's files.

93
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:36,290
It seems the Abbess can't wait
to grant us our request.

94
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,935
<i>And on the next day, Father La Chaise went
to retrieve the King's long lost daughter.</i>

95
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:48,578
<i>Thus starting Marie-Josephe's
great adventure.</i>

96
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,799
She's become incurably defiant.

97
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,426
Immune to all discipline.

98
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:57,439
Now reports over the years
have told of a prodigious musical talent

99
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,959
so poised in devotion to God.

100
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,548
Throughout her childhood, yes.
But she's become--

101
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:03,709
Dear Abbess…

102
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:08,479
I need to know whether her
talents might be welcomed…

103
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,872
in court.

104
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,497
You are leaving us, Marie-Josephe.

105
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,359
Where am I going?

106
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,818
To a lavish and glimmering hell.

107
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,720
Where you will no doubt thrive.

108
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,559
Do you serve the King?

109
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,640
No, I work for the King.

110
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,000
I serve God.

111
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,576
Are you taking me to meet the King or God?

112
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:19,842
I've always heard the tales of Versailles.

113
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,719
Never imagined
it would be quite so…

114
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,160
Magnificent?

115
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,106
It's definitely dreams.

116
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,101
Magali, please.

117
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,855
Marie-Joseph D'Alember.

118
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,399
-This is Magali.
-Bonjour.

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,207
Please show her to her room.

120
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,765
No, we're not in the chateau.

121
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:02,835
This way, Mademoiselle.

122
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:08,908
Sire, it is the hour.

123
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,969
Boring!

124
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,399
I could write better music than that.

125
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,612
Maybe you should compose
your own music, Your Majesty.

126
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:25,839
Maybe I should be my own priest.

127
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
Find me a composer who is fresh, fighting.

128
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:32,327
No hurry.

129
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,319
No hurry, meaning?

130
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,498
Immediately.

131
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,069
Shall we start our day?

132
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,919
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

133
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,741
I shared my bed last night
with Madame Scarron.

134
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,405
Devereaux.

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,119
It was Madame Devereaux.

136
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,839
I don't think so.

137
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,255
Devereaux is an intellectual.

138
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,731
She is also a brunette.

139
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,879
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

140
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,240
I shared my bed last night
with Madame Devereaux.

141
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
You should be forgiven.

142
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,526
To have earned private quarter
so quickly is a magnificent feat.

143
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,129
I doubt I've earned anything.

144
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,197
Humility will get you nowhere
at court, Mademoiselle.

145
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,973
Color and bravado
are the order of the day.

146
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,863
Look at those girls.
I don't fit in here.

147
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,760
It's my job to see that you will.

148
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,059
All ladies' chambers face east.

149
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:02,754
So that each awakens with
a ray of the King on her cheek.

150
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:07,483
It's the last piece she wrote
at the convent, your Majesty.

151
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:12,199
I am not the one to judge whether
or not her skills are good enough.

152
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,817
She's not without talent.

153
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,378
And remember she has no formal training.

154
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,380
I am speaking of talent,
the stuff one is made of.

155
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,639
I will meet her tomorrow.

156
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
And remember, no one must know,
she is my daughter.

157
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:34,959
So how long were you at the convent?

158
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,719
Since birth. I never knew my parents.

159
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,888
Were you taken from them
like I was from Mom?

160
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:41,831
No.

161
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:44,324
I was left there.

162
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:46,617
How poetic.

163
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,880
Trauma at the start of life
often inspires greatness.

164
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,197
Sometimes I think the trauma was greater
for the Abbess than it was for me.

165
00:13:02,544 --> 00:13:03,457
Your Majesty,

166
00:13:03,538 --> 00:13:07,271
first honor this morning is bestowed
on Monsieur Jean-Michel Lintillac,

167
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:10,977
son of the lace and export's baron,
Pierre Lintillac.

168
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:16,079
I feel a sense of awe standing
here in the lights of the Sun King.

169
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,959
-A light cast for all France.
-For all France!

170
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,799
I come to show my gratitude…

171
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,039
Our nations gratitude for your
recent military triumph.

172
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,700
It is the God's triumph.

173
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
And…

174
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,159
Our brave soldiers.

175
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,286
In honor of your upcoming birthday,
Your Majesty, let me offer this gift.

176
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:37,284
My father's dearest possession.

177
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,141
Forged from rare Chinese diamonds.

178
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,359
How I dislike birthdays.

179
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,080
They remind me of mortality.

180
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,319
They also remind you of your
soul's immortality, Your Majesty.

181
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,799
I'm not worried about my soul.
Well, not just yet.

182
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,079
So tell me, how is your dear father?

183
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,245
He's ready to pass from
this world to the next.

184
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:00,925
I see.

185
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,428
Perhaps there's more to do with the boy.

186
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:08,639
Meaning.

187
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,938
This war has depleted the treasury.

188
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:14,362
Why don't we just turn the boy upside down
and see what falls from his pockets?

189
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,679
He stands to inherit a fortune.

190
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,879
You are being secretive and enigmatic.

191
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,510
An inappropriate
behaviour for anyone but me.

192
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,960
Do you believe in coincidence?

193
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:27,556
Or fate?

194
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,452
Why is everyone staring?

195
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:34,680
Appearance is everything.

196
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,772
-Appearance?
-Yes, Mademoiselle.

197
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,652
They would rather gossip about you

198
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,319
than reflect on the
emptiness of their own lives.

199
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,840
Being kicked out of a convent
is hardly the making of a fairy tale.

200
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,559
Perhaps, but the fact
that the king had you brought here

201
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,959
makes you an object of intrigue.

202
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,344
Second only to some secret surprises he
has planned for the coming solar eclipse.

203
00:14:59,025 --> 00:15:01,104
The King owns the eclipse too, does he?

204
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,759
I guess when one rules
over the moon and the sun,

205
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,640
he is entitled to schedule
their rendezvous.

206
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,679
-Do you have a favorite fountain?
-Yes, the Fountain Flora.

207
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,285
It's right over there.

208
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,880
Isn't she beautiful?

209
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,720
Mademoiselle, be careful.

210
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Mademoiselle!

211
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
The King!

212
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:11,760
Allow me, Mademoiselle.

213
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,500
Marie-Josephe. Present yourself
before the King, if you please.

214
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,960
Might you remove that shock
from your face and offer a smile?

215
00:16:54,082 --> 00:16:56,082
Do you have a genuine smile?

216
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,673
Hidden somewhere?

217
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,366
No regrets, mademoiselle.

218
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:06,167
That statue is of a woman who has
caused many to lose their balance.

219
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,164
Although…

220
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
mostly men.

221
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,116
No need to bother, mademoiselle.

222
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,554
I have another one.

223
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,468
Move her to quarters
befitting my new composer.

224
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,920
Have we died and gone to heaven?

225
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:45,138
It think so.

226
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,879
We are now in the chateau,

227
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,386
among the truly privileged.

228
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,433
And I have been appointed
your lady in waiting.

229
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,011
It's all so magnificent.

230
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,720
If you could choose only one,
which would it be?

231
00:18:10,494 --> 00:18:12,374
They are all so beautiful.

232
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,600
But…

233
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,560
I choose my cello,

234
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,760
my freedom.

235
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
-Steady!
-Hold it!

236
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,519
The King built all of this,

237
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,037
bring water to Versailles from
the ocean via the Seine.

238
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,709
Those are a system of valves
that regulate the various fountains.

239
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,490
And there is the path to
the underground river.

240
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,146
Brings all the water here.

241
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,959
After the male was returned to the sea,

242
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,719
the female fell into a
dark and lethargic trance.

243
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,813
A seaman's drunken commentary.

244
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,759
There were two of them?

245
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,719
Yes, your majesty, but the male
is useless for our purpose.

246
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,399
Only the female possesses
the infinite light source.

247
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
What you propose,
doctor, is sacrilegious.

248
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,597
-What I'm proposing is revolutionary.
-Stop the bickering. Stop it.

249
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,310
I want to see the creature,
as soon as possible.

250
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,439
If this is real, we need it.

252
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,254
Which means we need him.

253
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:11,046
Why are you so anxious
to make him your enemy?

254
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,822
Self respect, perhaps.

255
00:20:12,903 --> 00:20:16,479
My immortality secures
the future of France.

256
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,697
The only thing God gives you as immortal

257
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:24,480
is your soul and you only have one
of those to lose.

258
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,447
There must be something you will eat.

259
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,016
Captain!

260
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,559
Bring out the creature!

261
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,430
That's easier said than done, sire.

262
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:41,201
She remains in the bottom,
weakened and traumatized from her journey.

263
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:43,877
You speak as if it was human.

264
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,319
Cannot speak to such things, father.

265
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,979
I only meant she behaves like a human.

266
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,639
She's rebellious, she won't eat.

267
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,485
It's as if she's lost the will to live.

268
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,400
Interesting.

269
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,261
Do you think it chooses to die?

270
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,839
Nonsense. The creature's condition
is unacceptable.

271
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,559
It must be brought to health at once.

272
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,439
You are the doctor, I am a sailor.

273
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,759
Perhaps you should remember that,
before you speak with such insolence.

274
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,079
Captain Yves,

275
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,439
Do you understand that the creature
is the centerpiece of the celebration?

276
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,079
-Yes, sire.
-Good.

277
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,239
Then see to its full and robust
recovery in time for the eclipse.

278
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,199
In return you shall receive
a royal pardon.

279
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,253
-Majesty.
-However,

280
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:27,588
you fail me,

281
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,036
and a dark cell will seem like paradise.

282
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,385
I promise.

283
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:33,799
What are you doing?
No one is allowed in here.

284
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,079
-What is that--
-I ask the questions, not you.

285
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,495
-Now answer me.
-It called me here.

286
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Who called you?

287
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,390
The creature, in the water.

288
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,170
-She called?
-Yes, with her music.

289
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:48,021
Can't you hear it?

290
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,343
I heard noise like

291
00:23:50,427 --> 00:23:52,747
a dolphin or a whale,
but certainly not music.

292
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,072
I want to use her song in my music.

293
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,480
So that the King and the whole
world can hear in it what I do.

294
00:24:06,275 --> 00:24:07,315
I'm not sure

295
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,920
which one of you is the more peculiar.

296
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,399
She has green eyes,
hair almost like ours.

297
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
And she called me from my chamber.

298
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,919
A beautiful hairy fish called
you from your chamber?

299
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,840
No, no. Not a fish.

300
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,399
I think she is a mermaid.
Like in the books.

301
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,242
Her music inspired this.

302
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:04,839
Don't fret, moussieres.

303
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,680
A woman's soul is as musical as a man's.

304
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:12,811
With perhaps, a touch more vibrato.

305
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,520
Sir, it is the hour.

306
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,773
A touch of melancholy.

307
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,535
Like nothing I've ever heard before.

308
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:47,599
Seems both off this world and another.

309
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,365
Invite our young composer to the ball.

310
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,947
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

311
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Yes?

312
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,960
I can't remember the exact
details of what happened last night.

313
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,269
I understand. You're forgiven.

314
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,596
At the convent we used to pretend to put
a makeup for an imaginary grand ball.

315
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,520
Mademoiselle, you spoil things.
Don't speak.

316
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,380
Now…

317
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,760
Prepare to dazzle.

318
00:26:41,427 --> 00:26:42,636
Magali!

319
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:43,865
What's wrong?

320
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,199
I look like a clown!

321
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,240
Nonsense, that's how all
the ladies will be painted.

322
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:52,099
Oh then maybe I'd rather look like a man.

323
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,780
That's also how the men will look.

324
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,760
Your Majesty,

325
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,159
may I present a somewhat

326
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,747
different version
of mademoiselle D'Alembert.

327
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,138
I like this unique look of yours.

328
00:27:39,987 --> 00:27:42,479
-Perhaps others will follow.
-Oh, I doubt it.

329
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,919
You are something they can never be.

330
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,200
An individual.

331
00:27:47,177 --> 00:27:49,737
In all things, I suspect.

332
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:52,531
Including your music.

333
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:54,467
I need your help.

334
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

335
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,599
I need a brilliant suite for
the celebration of the eclipse.

336
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,799
Something regal, something spiritual…

337
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,865
- Something befitting Apollo.
- And the Sun King?

338
00:28:11,596 --> 00:28:12,959
Monsieur Lintillac.

339
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,299
Perhaps you can offer to dance
with this young mademoiselle.

340
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,408
I would be honored.

341
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,719
The two newest members of the court,

342
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,799
one, the dashing son of the
France's wealthiest merchant,

343
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,999
And an orphan, recently
freed from a convent defined by

344
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,649
humility and chastity.

345
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,099
Then I must humbly ask
whether such a virtuous young lady

346
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,644
would even know how to dance.

347
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:39,199
I'm afraid, Your Majesty,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

348
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,720
Well then, mademoiselle.
Allow me to take the lead.

349
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,080
A minuet. Three quarter time.

350
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,322
Down, up, down, up…

351
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:03,200
Now, kick. That's it. Beautiful.

352
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:06,853
And away. Yes, to me. A spin.

353
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,840
Beautiful. And Kick…

354
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,080
And kick.

355
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,585
And up… And turn around…

356
00:29:20,666 --> 00:29:23,928
Well, and hold, that's it.

357
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:25,199
Back.

358
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,199
And down.

359
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,522
Now away.

360
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:31,678
To me.

361
00:29:33,763 --> 00:29:34,974
And here we go.

362
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:52,971
I am so sorry.

363
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,506
You did fine, my dear.

364
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:58,611
She is very beautiful.

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
What she is, is an opportunity.

366
00:30:04,459 --> 00:30:06,339
This one I don't fully understand yet.

367
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,520
Everyone, come and enjoy the fireworks!

368
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:30,159
It was so amazing.

369
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,759
The King is the most graceful dancer.

370
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,584
You would have loved the fireworks.

371
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,913
It was so spectacular.

372
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,480
Something about you scares her.

373
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,640
Perhaps it's because
you're feeding her dead fish.

374
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,920
-She told you that?
-Of course. Who else?

375
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:58,899
Who else indeed?

376
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,999
This place is so beautiful.

377
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,200
I love the water.

378
00:31:05,212 --> 00:31:06,665
You don't seem to be afraid of it.

379
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,159
You don't seem to be afraid of anything.

380
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Definitely not water.
I grew up by the sea.

381
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,319
It was the only place I could
go to escape the prison of my convent.

382
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,273
I feel the same way about Versailles.

383
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:23,879
Out there, beyond that gate,
is a sailor's favorite sight.

384
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,275
The shore line
disappearing in the distance.

385
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,356
Not knowing what's coming next,
other than grand adventure.

386
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:32,189
Sounds wonderful.

387
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:36,319
Have you ever been to sea?

388
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,649
Only in my dreams.

389
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,459
The Abbess considered
even swimming a crime.

390
00:31:41,028 --> 00:31:42,028
A crime?

391
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:45,067
- Against who?
- Against God.

392
00:31:48,376 --> 00:31:51,119
The life force has been confirmed.

393
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,438
As I predicted,
it emanates from the heart.

394
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,822
Once the water has been drained,

395
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:01,556
the creature will be killed
and the organelle removed,

396
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,921
placing the life force into our hands.

397
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:15,053
It's a lovely dress.
Interesting. With your eyes.

398
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,530
I have never seen anything like it.

399
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:22,381
It is wonderful to be here
with someone again.

400
00:32:24,111 --> 00:32:26,111
A completely different experience.

401
00:32:27,954 --> 00:32:31,394
I understand you have
company here from time to time.

402
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:33,482
A rumor.

403
00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:38,061
Odd in a court so devoid of gossip.

404
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,100
It doesn't make it false.

405
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,540
The statue in the fountain
where you fell in…

406
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,279
That was the last woman
who was here with me in the garden.

407
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,535
-Who is she?
-I used to draw her.

408
00:32:52,795 --> 00:32:54,035
I'm not very good.

409
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:57,725
Her name was Louise de Valiere.

410
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,481
-Do I remind you of her?
-No one reminds me of her.

411
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,190
Till you.

412
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,879
I'm afraid I've abused my authority…

413
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,639
I questioned some
of the nuns at your convent.

414
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,800
The ones you liked.

415
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,600
-Well, there's such a thing as privacy.
-Oh, I shouldn't think so.

416
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:21,174
They tell me that you like to ride

417
00:33:21,255 --> 00:33:23,084
and are fascinated by spiders,

418
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:26,319
which is strange, because they
terrified you as a young girl

419
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,480
-after one bit you in the leg.
-You can't possibly know that.

420
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:31,499
I'm a King, you know?

421
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:36,066
And kings have a way of
knowing absolutely everything.

422
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:49,026
You have made a pledge of
two million livre.

423
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,719
That's a hefty sum, sir,
even for a duchy.

424
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,152
The cost is too great
to honor my father's life.

425
00:33:55,923 --> 00:33:59,488
I see no reason to place the duchy
into the ground with your father.

426
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:02,422
The title "Duke de Lintillac"

427
00:34:03,267 --> 00:34:04,867
should remain alive

428
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,320
as yours.

429
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:12,652
I am touched beyond words, Your Majesty.

430
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:26,914
You didn't tell me this fisherman was so

431
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,039
So…

432
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,520
-Handsome?
-Exactly.

433
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,160
The creature seems to have recovered,
Your Majesty.

434
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,795
It will be in perfect health
for the ceremony.

435
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,439
Good servants of France.

436
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,201
In memory of the export
baron, Pierre Lintillac,

437
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,120
who has found safe passage
to the kingdom of heaven,

438
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:03,306
I present to you his son,
the future Duke de Lintillac.

439
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:06,827
Whose title shall be bestowed by me

440
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:11,461
in my supreme celebration
of the solar eclipse.

441
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:14,122
For all France!

442
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:15,760
For all France!

443
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:21,049
One barracuda is gruesome enough.

444
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,599
Ten will curdle your toes.

445
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,199
We hit a pod of 300 big ones.

446
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,080
Meaner than a slam boon
of drunken musketeers.

447
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,519
They were ramming the hull.
Bang!

448
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,679
Forcing us onto the rocks.

449
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,199
And just as they were about
to tear through the planks--

450
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,419
How frightening.

451
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,298
Now you'll be telling us you
tore them apart with your bear teeth.

452
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:46,674
We turned sail and
beat them with the wind.

453
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:48,963
The easy way.

454
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:51,732
I think it's the clever way out.

455
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,044
A man who fails to kill his prey
is either a weakling or a coward.

456
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,845
And a man who sees
only two choices is a fool.

457
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,840
-You're worthless commoner.
-And you merely behave like one.

458
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
That's enough!

459
00:36:07,162 --> 00:36:08,162
Calm.

460
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,439
Your Majesty.

461
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
It was all my fault.

462
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:16,979
Serve the sixth course. Play on.

463
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,240
Marie-Josephe!

464
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,456
You should not be swimming in there.

465
00:37:45,635 --> 00:37:47,498
Her tail is sharp enough
to cut through stone.

466
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,019
Luckily I'm not made of stone.

467
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,701
No, I suppose you're not.

468
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:05,777
Good shot!

469
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:10,916
Why do you hate him so much?

470
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,279
I used to sell lace to China
for his father.

471
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,159
On our last voyage, the Chinese
refused to pay for half

472
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,880
so our soon to be duke accused me
of stealing and had had me arrested.

473
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,439
Shame isn't it?
When lies obscure the truth.

474
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,670
Seems to be the way
things work around here.

475
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:27,668
Not with you.

476
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:29,529
You say what you think.

477
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
As do you.

478
00:38:31,796 --> 00:38:33,956
Yes. And it gets me in trouble.

479
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,360
So you can ride!

480
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,520
Perhaps better than you!

481
00:39:32,045 --> 00:39:33,645
The arm is badly broken.

482
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,012
I'm afraid we're going
to have to amputate.

483
00:39:37,552 --> 00:39:38,419
No.

484
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,479
The bone will not heal itself,
mademoiselle.

485
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,536
This is the prescribed procedure.

486
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:45,279
Father, please,

487
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,040
don't let him take my arm.

488
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,011
God will protect me.

489
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,039
Put her arm back in the sling doctor
and review her condition in the morning.

490
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,734
You are out
of your element here, father?

491
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:59,497
If we don't act, the infection
will result in the loss of life.

492
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:00,658
Act how?

493
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,713
Your Majesty.

494
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:05,440
He wants to take my arm.

495
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:09,959
Surely, we can review the situation in the
morning before taking such drastic action.

496
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,520
-I'm not sure--
-Hold your silence.

497
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
May I?

498
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,440
Life is filled with suffering, my child.

499
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
And you have suffered with such grace.

500
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,020
Just rest.

501
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Get out of there.

502
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,800
God is with her.

503
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,800
Even better than science.

504
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,360
Monsieur Yves.

505
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,370
She's not well.

506
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,840
The mermaid. She wants to help.

507
00:41:48,997 --> 00:41:49,997
She told you?

508
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:51,809
Who else?

509
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,640
The fish also speaks to you?

510
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,200
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.

511
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,000
If anything happens,
I'll never forgive myself.

512
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,120
Imagine how I would feel.

513
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,400
Could she possibly have healed so quickly?

514
00:43:20,788 --> 00:43:22,788
Apparently she is capable of anything.

515
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,120
She produced a golden light, Your Majesty.

516
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,519
And I could breathe underwater.

517
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,359
Incontrovertible proof, Your Majesty.

518
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,440
Proof?

519
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:39,334
I assume, mademoiselle, you have heard of
the extraordinary powers of the creature.

520
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:41,134
I agree that something has occurred here

521
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,677
but what is not yet clear,
you're speaking of fables.

522
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:46,079
Everything is a fable until proven true.

523
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,479
And now the creature has chosen you

524
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,923
as the first to experience
her healing powers.

525
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,924
Don't call her a creature.

526
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,167
She has a soul, just the same as you.

527
00:43:56,248 --> 00:43:58,359
Nonsense. She is a creature.

528
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,275
And her purpose is to serve the court.

529
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,239
Is that why she's here,
are you ill and in need of a cure?

530
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,127
-I must be excused.
-Sit, father.

531
00:44:10,338 --> 00:44:11,658
No one's ill, child.

532
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,114
Your new friend is here to herald a brand
new day for all the servants of France.

533
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,360
You are the most
wonderful and generous monarch.

534
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:34,044
By using the mermaid's power to heal
the common people of France.

535
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:37,755
You have earned your place in eternity.

536
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Well,

537
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,040
as long as it's earned.

538
00:44:43,569 --> 00:44:46,756
And once she has completed
this wonderful task,

539
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,600
will you then set her free?

540
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,120
Her life shall be what God intends.

541
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,639
The mermaid was brought
here for the King, not for France,

542
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,026
just as I was and just as you were.

543
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:02,186
I have more faith in him than you do.

544
00:45:02,756 --> 00:45:05,079
Perhaps, but you are too naive.

545
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,683
And you are too cynical.

546
00:45:08,307 --> 00:45:10,556
With all due respect, mademoiselle,

547
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,811
what do you know of the world

548
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:13,975
that you've not seen from
the window of a convent?

549
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,876
Please do not assume that

550
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,280
that I have not lived as broadly as you
that I have not lived as deeply.

551
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,967
Besides, one day I will see the world.

552
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,800
I believe you will.

553
00:45:28,185 --> 00:45:29,285
I meant no offense.

554
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:44,923
I thought you were going to show
me a different side of Versailles?

555
00:45:45,004 --> 00:45:46,720
I am. Look.

556
00:45:50,763 --> 00:45:53,427
What are people saying about the
mystery of the King's common girl?

557
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:56,747
Well, common girl, maybe.

558
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,190
Rumor has it she has ties to the King.

559
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,240
What kind of ties?

560
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,320
That is still a mystery.

561
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,800
Mademoiselle!

562
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,239
That's the fishermen's house
where Benoit and I live.

563
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,440
It's so sweet.

564
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Sweet?

565
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,480
Sweet is not a word used for fishermen.

566
00:46:31,516 --> 00:46:34,159
Dashing, courageous, fearless,

567
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
not sweet.

568
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:41,998
-You have a lighthouse?
-I'm afraid so.

569
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:44,055
It's only a few more steps.

570
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,400
The sight is so beautiful.

571
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
Yes, but…

572
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:59,159
But out there, beyond the horizon,
where the river meets the sea,

573
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,244
that's where--

574
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:02,480
Every sailor gets his last look at France.

575
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,865
I can see you now,
at the helm of your ship.

576
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:13,073
Sailing into the sunset.

577
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:16,484
That's my dream.

578
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,000
Sail away from all this.

579
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,200
What's your dream?

580
00:47:25,965 --> 00:47:28,085
I want the mermaid to return to her home.

581
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:31,207
-She's certainly not of this world.
-Nor am I.

582
00:47:32,404 --> 00:47:33,764
I want to go with her.

583
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:35,799
To go with her?

584
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Not really but,

585
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,080
I could swim in her light.

586
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,577
And I'd outrun the fastest ship.

587
00:47:45,826 --> 00:47:48,266
One day I will have you
on the bow of my ship.

588
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,560
We will race the mermaid
and see who's the fastest.

589
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,779
Come, there's more to see.

590
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,759
This is amazing. What is it?

591
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,480
It's called the Temple of Love.

592
00:48:23,127 --> 00:48:24,927
Built in honor of an woman, unnamed.

593
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,418
Rumor is that--

594
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,174
Thank you for receiving me, Your Majesty.

595
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:47,705
There is something I must
ask for, humbly. Respectfully.

596
00:48:47,786 --> 00:48:51,479
But first, permit me to ask
something of you.

597
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,236
Something for France.

598
00:48:53,874 --> 00:48:56,154
Anything, Your Majesty, even my life.

599
00:48:57,003 --> 00:48:59,083
It's something a little less drastic.

600
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:06,122
I want you to accept the hand of my
daughter, Marie-Josephe, in marriage.

601
00:49:08,961 --> 00:49:09,961
I'm overwhelmed.

602
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,240
This would be an honor.

603
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,200
Good.

604
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:16,965
Well.

605
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,564
Since you obviously
weren't listening at the door,

606
00:49:19,645 --> 00:49:21,279
you must be completely in the dark.

607
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,360
Utterly.

608
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:27,727
-What do you think?
-Does she love Lintillac?

609
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:31,250
Does it actually matter to you?

610
00:49:33,122 --> 00:49:34,282
Am I so…

611
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,719
endlessly and infinitely self-centered?

612
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,840
It's worse.

613
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:41,930
Your power is so complete

614
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:46,049
you're never allowed to care about anyone.

615
00:49:47,748 --> 00:49:49,348
And it's rather terrible.

616
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:54,891
-What are you doing?
-She called me.

617
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,021
I never knew I could feel like this.

618
00:50:52,102 --> 00:50:55,024
Mademoiselle, stars in
your eyes becoming you.

619
00:50:56,196 --> 00:50:57,199
Father.

620
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,083
Something amazing has happened,
I was just coming to tell you.

621
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:01,373
Later, little one.

622
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:03,820
The King has asked to see you.

623
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:07,253
You will step forward slowly.

624
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,600
And quietly.

625
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:18,148
Do you recall our
conversation in the garden?

626
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:20,839
About the woman of the fountain?

627
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,920
Yes, of course. The only woman--

628
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,381
You remind me so much of her.

629
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,000
At times I think you are her.

630
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:33,011
You are

631
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:36,115
the very spirit of your mother.

632
00:51:39,123 --> 00:51:40,203
My mother?

633
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:44,667
She had a mind and spirit, all her own.

634
00:51:46,378 --> 00:51:48,378
She was an individual.

635
00:51:51,402 --> 00:51:53,082
She was not made for court life.

636
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,356
Any more than you are.

637
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,000
She left with the convent
before I knew she was with child.

638
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,156
She died giving birth.

639
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:19,719
You are my father.

640
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Yes.

641
00:52:24,858 --> 00:52:26,499
But I am a terrible man.

642
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:29,411
A very selfish man.

643
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,840
I have cared more for France
than about you, or even her.

644
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:38,639
Why are you telling me this?

645
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,200
Because there are sacrifices
you must make for France.

646
00:52:44,476 --> 00:52:45,639
Sacrifice?

647
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,279
Our country's treasury is empty.

648
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,914
Enemies surround us.

649
00:52:50,473 --> 00:52:51,817
Lies, treachery.

650
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,760
We need money, child.

651
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:56,703
The young Duke Lintillac…

652
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,909
His money, when you marry him…

653
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,999
No! No!

654
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,529
I won't marry that man! I won't!

655
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:05,560
You don't have to agree, child.

656
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:10,756
You have to obey.

657
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:19,117
Of course…

658
00:53:20,808 --> 00:53:21,808
Your Majesty.

659
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,040
For all France.

660
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,480
I prayed every night
as a little girl

661
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,801
for a mother and father.

662
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:22,090
And now I wish my prayers
had never been answered.

663
00:54:23,899 --> 00:54:26,699
You must stop
hoping for a perfect world.

664
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:29,808
And we live in this one.

665
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:46,384
You understand things, don't you?

666
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,439
I have experienced something.

667
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,316
The mermaid has touched
the very fabric of my being.

668
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,023
Only God can grant us immortality,

669
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:06,859
unless you believe that
he has bestowed power on you.

670
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,609
I believe he's bestowed on me
the power to discover.

671
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,519
I'm speaking of the soul.

672
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,815
I love the King!

673
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,359
By murdering an
intelligent being in his name,

674
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,072
you are committing him
to eternal damnation.

675
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:25,474
Go back to your monastery, priest.

676
00:56:27,841 --> 00:56:29,321
Worry about your own soul.

677
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,620
And stay out of my way.

678
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,840
I'm no more free than you are.

679
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,040
Heave!

680
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
No!

681
00:58:30,785 --> 00:58:32,719
Everything is in order, Your Majesty.

682
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,199
The creature is in
peak condition for the procedure.

683
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,719
Good. Talk me through.

684
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,280
-Yes.
-Your Majesty…

685
00:58:40,305 --> 00:58:42,410
I can no longer keep silence.

686
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,359
How unlike you.

687
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,836
Sit, father.

688
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,930
I know your feelings.

689
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:55,159
You are contemplating
the greatest mortal sin.

690
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,959
This is not about sin, it's about science.

691
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,719
Science is not absolute, Your Majesty.

692
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:07,179
"He who searches the hearts of men,
will know the mind of the spirit."

693
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,250
Thank you for your nice line of scripture

694
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:12,839
but unless you've talked to God,
I don't believe you know his will.

695
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,682
Perhaps not, but I do know that
immortality is the province of God alone.

696
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:21,359
Then who placed the mermaid
in the sea for us to capture?

697
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,519
Who called upon me to carry out
his vision of a supreme France?

698
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,003
Do not confuse divine right
and divine guidance.

699
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:31,927
Then let him decide matters.

700
00:59:34,546 --> 00:59:37,706
Command me, oh, Heavenly Father,

701
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:41,879
strike me down here and now

702
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:45,840
if I am about to commit a mortal sin.

703
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,439
Now father…

704
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,880
If my communion with the
creature gives me eternal life…

705
01:00:00,418 --> 01:00:01,560
It will be God's will.

706
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,200
Carry on.

707
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:51,040
Benoit…

708
01:01:55,605 --> 01:01:56,800
They are going to kill her.

709
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,840
We need to warn Marie-Josephe.

710
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,560
Tomorrow a new age
will dawn for all but us.

711
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,720
-You need to make a diversion.
-I do. I do?

712
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,230
I do.

713
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,120
Mousierre.

714
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,573
Halt! Come back here!

715
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,840
-Doctor, I was hoping to--
-Save your breath, De La Croix.

716
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:12,966
You were in enough trouble, but sneaking
around the room of the King's daughter,

717
01:03:13,817 --> 01:03:15,337
now, that's a capital offense.

718
01:03:17,763 --> 01:03:18,923
Lock him up for the night.

719
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,680
Kick him.

720
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,760
There will be no music this morning.
Leave your instruments.

721
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:06,315
It is the hour, sir.

722
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,560
You cannot kill the mermaid!
I won't let you!

723
01:04:18,596 --> 01:04:20,036
You won't let me?

724
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,084
Didn't the Abbess teach you any manner?

725
01:04:22,184 --> 01:04:23,479
Here is my offer.

726
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,774
You return her to the sea and
I will consent to this marriage.

727
01:04:26,855 --> 01:04:29,994
You can't haggle with your King
like some shopkeeper.

728
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,279
I can scarcely believe I was so blind
as not to see this moment coming.

729
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,759
You swim with her, you commune with her,
she is your pet.

730
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,359
No! She is all but human!

731
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,143
She feels her life just as we feel ours.

732
01:04:43,224 --> 01:04:44,224
Maybe so.

733
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:48,120
But you are the one
who has proven the doctor right.

734
01:04:49,836 --> 01:04:52,319
You think I want this
for my own immortality?

735
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,582
France needs a leader
who can protect her.

736
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:57,151
This is ridiculous! This is murder!

737
01:04:57,232 --> 01:04:59,319
-Silence!
-Silence to you, father!

738
01:05:11,705 --> 01:05:13,345
Your wedding is today.

739
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:16,145
Be ready.

740
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,757
Musketeers!

741
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,999
Who is getting married today?

742
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,743
Mademoiselle D'Alembert
is to marry Monsieur Lintillac.

743
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:41,680
Marie-Josephe?

744
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,680
Mademoiselle, you must calm down
and prepare for the wedding.

745
01:06:04,447 --> 01:06:08,133
Magali, please go call Pere La Chaise
to come hear my confession.

746
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,658
You will do exactly as
you've been ordered.

747
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:18,322
Or you shall forfeit your life.

748
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:21,417
Drain the water.

749
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,020
Killing the mermaid will damn his soul
rather than save it.

750
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,879
You are the only one who can stop him.

751
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:41,858
-I can't.
-Yes, yes you can.

752
01:06:41,939 --> 01:06:44,259
Sorry, I have tried.

753
01:06:45,155 --> 01:06:46,759
The King has ruled for so long

754
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,480
he believes he's been given
permission by the Almighty.

755
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:53,420
Then free me from this chamber
so I may bid the mermaid farewell.

756
01:06:54,474 --> 01:06:56,767
The King has forbidden for the contact.

757
01:06:56,848 --> 01:07:00,320
Which is why I'm asking you.
No, I'm begging you, Father,

758
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,360
please help me.

759
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,570
Forget what's proper.

760
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:07,435
And do what's right.

761
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,260
My reasons may be different from yours…

762
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,080
But the mermaid must escape the King.

763
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:31,781
No one will believe you
are going to a wedding

764
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:34,948
dressed like that.

765
01:07:45,364 --> 01:07:46,724
My dearest Magali,

766
01:07:48,938 --> 01:07:50,498
you have been a true friend.

767
01:07:52,253 --> 01:07:53,573
I will miss you greatly.

768
01:07:54,613 --> 01:07:55,973
I am frightened for you.

769
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,120
Weren't you the one who told me

770
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,840
that a little trauma
can inspires greatness?

771
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,000
It was just kidding.

772
01:08:21,003 --> 01:08:22,559
I'm taking the girl to confession.

773
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,561
I have orders to hold
her here until the wedding.

774
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:30,046
And you dare challenge me?

775
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,680
This is a kiss I've always thought
I'd give to my father.

776
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,480
God has graced you with wings.

777
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,520
I only hope you know how to fly.

778
01:10:05,881 --> 01:10:06,961
Secure the rope.

779
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:09,005
Hoist the net.

780
01:10:13,059 --> 01:10:15,379
What? We haven't got all day.

781
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,800
Benoit.

782
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:28,719
-You can't possibly be doing this.
-We do what he says.

783
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,923
Whether we end up in the
Bastille or marry for money,

784
01:10:31,004 --> 01:10:32,129
we do as are told.

785
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,159
I would never let him sentence me.

786
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,346
Why would you?

787
01:10:36,516 --> 01:10:37,999
I swam with her last night.

788
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,966
She conveyed to me
that you were her captor.

789
01:10:41,629 --> 01:10:43,469
Did you know you took her from her child?

790
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,740
-No.
-But you knew of her mate?

791
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:48,079
Yes, and we set him free.

792
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,519
Then you owe her the right
to return to whatever family she has left.

793
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,119
And have my men face the gallows.

794
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,808
I'm not asking them.

795
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,516
I'm asking you.

796
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,520
What makes you desire to sail the sea more
important than her right to live there?

797
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:05,580
-The King justifies everything?
-You mean your father.

798
01:11:06,483 --> 01:11:07,683
I mean the King.

799
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:10,700
Are you no better than him?

800
01:11:11,562 --> 01:11:12,562
You said…

801
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,880
the King can't sentence me.

802
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,600
Did you mean--

803
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,200
I could never marry a man
I do not love.

804
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,879
Everybody out! Take the men.

805
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,279
Head for the ships and set sail
at once for the cliff of Le Havre.

806
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,647
What about you two?

807
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,120
With God willing we will see you there.

808
01:11:42,501 --> 01:11:45,977
Let's go then. You heard the captain.
Let's move!

809
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:49,927
We're going to need to cross the bridge.

810
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,960
You'll ruin your dress.

811
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,760
So I will.

812
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,159
-You will follow the directions I gave--
-Doctor!

813
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:03,240
Yes?

814
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:06,428
It's the girl. She's escaped.

815
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,959
Her only chance is to go
through the underground river.

816
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,925
At least she is swimming to her freedom.

817
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:34,055
The water level is too low for
her to jump the retaining wall.

818
01:12:35,414 --> 01:12:37,959
Can't you drain the water
from the chateau into the pool?

819
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,039
If we drain the canal and the fountains
all at once, it might work but…

820
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,133
-But what?
-The pipes might not hold.

821
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,740
-What if they do?
-There is a tributary before Le Havre.

822
01:12:48,821 --> 01:12:50,399
which will give safe harbor to the sea.

823
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,760
Can you communicate that to her?

824
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,080
She understands everything.

825
01:13:15,217 --> 01:13:16,337
We should get moving.

826
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,440
We need to reverse the water pressure.

827
01:13:58,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Stop them!

828
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,799
The creature!

829
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,215
It must not escape!

830
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:05,959
No!

831
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,600
We need it alive.

832
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,360
Yves!

833
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,920
You need to jump the wall!

834
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:39,937
Labarthe!

835
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
Yves!

836
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,640
Yves!

837
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,705
You've interfered enough!

838
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,844
Take Yves and go!

839
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,120
Now!

840
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,000
See you there, God willing.

841
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,439
The entire hydraulic
system have collapsed.

842
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,759
And what of the girl?

843
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,600
She was seen, riding off
the grounds, Your Majesty.

844
01:17:12,638 --> 01:17:13,559
This way to Le Havre.

845
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,005
Order out the ships so there's no escape.

846
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,160
Momma, a mermaid!

847
01:18:04,696 --> 01:18:08,456
Jean, you must have seen a fish.
Mermaids don't exist.

848
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:13,880
Marie-Josephe!

849
01:19:15,156 --> 01:19:16,159
Stop.

850
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,419
Stay.

851
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,120
I will jump.

852
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,360
You can't mean that.

853
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,599
You are angry.

854
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,880
-I understand, but life is so precious.
-No!

855
01:19:27,419 --> 01:19:28,939
You think you understand.

856
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,141
You don't.

857
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:33,433
Then tell me.

858
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:39,090
The only opportunity I've ever wanted

859
01:19:40,349 --> 01:19:41,669
was to belong to someone.

860
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,360
I came here,

861
01:19:46,973 --> 01:19:47,973
fell in love.

862
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:53,745
I met a mermaid who has become
the greatest friend.

863
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,910
And I found you…

864
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:00,296
Father.

865
01:20:04,909 --> 01:20:07,959
-But you don't care about me.
-Don't say that.

866
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,367
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

867
01:20:14,115 --> 01:20:16,035
Give me the chance to prove you wrong.

868
01:20:17,028 --> 01:20:18,468
How could that ever be?

869
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,587
Musketeers,

870
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,954
mark your target.

871
01:20:51,423 --> 01:20:52,258
It's simple.

872
01:20:53,076 --> 01:20:55,596
You take the mermaid, she gives you life.

873
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:58,244
You let her live,

874
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:01,289
she saves mine.

875
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,520
What's your choice?

876
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,280
Come get me.

877
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,880
No!

878
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,680
I have a clean shot, Your Majesty.

879
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,280
We're running out of time.

880
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,240
Stand down.

881
01:22:48,477 --> 01:22:49,759
Are you all right?

882
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,280
Yes, are you?

883
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:53,717
She saved me.

884
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,560
Us.

885
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,121
You've always been a great king.

886
01:23:10,136 --> 01:23:12,696
But now you've become a great man.

887
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,360
Signal the ships to retreat.

888
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,320
You were right.

889
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,480
It's something terrible.

890
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,280
To care for someone.

891
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,960
Bless me Father for I have sinned.

892
01:23:49,527 --> 01:23:54,004
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

893
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:57,680
Amen.

894
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,320
You are forgiven.

895
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,080
Only love is immortal, Your Majesty.

896
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,199
<i>So Captain Yves and Marie-Josephe</i>

897
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:29,836
<i>started their life together
in search of Atlantis</i>

898
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,560
<i>and their dear friend,
the magical mermaid.</i>

899
01:24:34,686 --> 01:24:37,046
We're close, I can feel it.

899
01:24:38,305 --> 01:25:38,703
