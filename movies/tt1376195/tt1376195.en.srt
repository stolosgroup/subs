2
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,746
You, uh...

3
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,373
speaky...

4
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,875
English?

5
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,501
Do you?

6
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,339
You stink.

7
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,175
You don't say.

8
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,551
Oh...

9
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,137
think maybe you could unsnare me?

10
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,600
Oh... Oh.

11
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,144
Better untie me.

12
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,230
Pardon?

13
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,692
Ah, forget it.

14
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,368
God... dammit.

15
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,581
Where the hell am I?

16
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,000
- Barclay's Brush.
- Where?

17
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,919
In the Dominion of Canada.

18
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,551
- Just when you thought
it couldn't get any worse. Huh.

19
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,723
Bonjour.

20
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,309
How can I help you?

21
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,395
Bullets.

22
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,022
Mon Dieu, we are...

23
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,693
we are fresh out of bullets.
Um, perhaps I could interest you

24
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,196
in some tea?
A little, uh...

25
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,240
"special tea"?
- As a matter of fact,

26
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,908
we do carry ammunition.

27
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,284
What calibre, sir?

28
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,371
- Ah-ah-ah! No poaching.
My customer, my side.

29
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,165
You can't talk to him.
- Oh...

30
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,625
how clumsy of me.

31
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,669
I've spilled bullets
all over the counter.

32
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,426
Good day, sir.
How can I be of assistance?

33
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,763
- I need cartridges,
45.40 Colt.

34
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,182
- That will be $1.10,
or a penny a bullet.

35
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,977
- The thing is that I'm a lick strapped
at the moment.

36
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,812
Maybe we could settle up this account

37
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,480
a little later...
- Sorry, no credit.

38
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,024
Your rules.

39
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,860
Oh, I see.
Is okay when you break the rules.

40
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,697
But when I bend them just a little,
we have to sever the partnership.

41
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,573
There is an enormous distinction

42
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,868
between having
a flexible policy on credit

43
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,787
and contravening the law!

44
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,706
Prohibition, Claude,
means no liquor.

45
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,666
- Salaud.
- Thank you very much,

46
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,710
Mr., um...

47
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,920
"The Montana Kid."

48
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,089
I'll show you prohibition!

49
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,966
Free drinks!

50
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,926
Free whiskey

51
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,886
for anyone on my side...

52
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,682
...to some stranger who smells

53
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,852
like he came out the back end
of a pig is a retail genius!

54
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,021
Explain.

55
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,238
- He walks out that door,
you never see this bum again.

56
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,834
I'm not partial to insults.

57
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,461
But...

58
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,131
...seeing as one of you

59
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,593
was clearly raised by a mother
of a fiercely hideous countenance,

60
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,346
I am affected by a rare blush of...

61
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,518
Put me down for three more.

62
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,108
And one carrot.

63
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,968
Son of a...

64
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,639
Ahem. Hey.

65
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,891
Ahem. Hey there, you two.

66
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,644
Either of you seen my mount?

67
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,896
Is a chestnut

68
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,857
with a Cheyenne roll on the saddle.
I left him just back...

69
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,360
Whoa, steady on there, mister.

70
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,365
- You just tell me,
have you seen my animal?

71
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,534
Jack collected a stray.

72
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,202
Blacksmith?

73
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,745
Behind you?

74
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,964
Thas my horse.

75
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,508
I believe he's in pain.

76
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,804
Reckon so. A stone bruise.

77
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,890
- So first you thieve him,
then deliver him to torment?

78
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,726
I retrieved a stray.

79
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,566
I've shot men for less.

80
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,902
- You need to reign in that temper,
mister.

81
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,785
I ain't done.

82
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,829
He forged that hoof.

83
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,250
You ain't touchin' him.

84
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:44,004
- I don't got time
for a common nuisance.

85
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,258
- What did you just call me?
- A nuisance.

86
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,927
- No, before that.
What did you call me?

87
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,721
- Common?
- Oh...

88
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,141
you just stepped over the line.
Hey, whoa, whoa!

89
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,435
What the he?

90
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,483
What kind of man
would pick up another man?!

91
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,609
Hey, you! Hey!

92
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,029
I ain't finished with you,
you big ape.

93
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,157
- Swear to God, I ain't got...
- What the hell?!

94
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,372
Get...

95
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,208
your...

96
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,459
gun.

97
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,436
I'm callin' you out.

98
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,776
I said I'm callin' you out.

99
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,118
Hey, what?

100
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,286
Ahem.

101
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:02,374
You mind telling that big ape in there
I'm callin' him out here.

102
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,378
Jack! The windmill...

103
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,345
Ah, there's no rush.

104
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,681
Ill take a couple of days
to fashion the windmill. Come on.

105
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,268
Jack says to tell you he can't oblige.
He's got no gun.

106
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,479
- He's a liar.
- Is not. The man's an ironsmith.

107
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,440
And he's right. You stink.

108
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,485
That man stole my horse.

109
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,737
He was trying to help.

110
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,617
- You tell him to get a gun on his belt.
At sundown, we'll square this up.

111
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,453
- He says not to be riding him
for at least two days.

112
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,539
Sundown.

113
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,795
Your bottom is bleeding.

114
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,422
Yeah, I know.

115
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,856
Well, hello again.

116
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,610
I'd say a.36 calibre.
Am I right?

117
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,029
- I didn't get a good look at it
on the way in.

118
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,990
- Well, did you get a good look
at what hit you on the head?

119
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:22,329
Because that is a peevish gash.
- Ah, God! Mother of Mary! Mary!

120
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,123
- Well, is Dr. Angus Schiffron,
actually.

121
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,792
Well, you can call me Mary, then.
- Where's my gun?

122
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,503
- Hold on, Tex.
I still gotta patch up that gluteus.

123
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,465
- Where?
- Uh, your gluteus, in your backside.

124
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,675
No. Where is my gun?

125
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,474
I appreciate you tendin' to my wounds,
doc, but I ain't got no money.

126
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,894
- I always pull the first bullet
out of a man's posterior pro bono.

127
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,520
Is a time-honoured tradition.

128
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,564
Now, if you just let me
patch up that wound,

129
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,107
I can get...
- What did you do?

130
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,526
I had to get to your injury, eh?

131
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,529
You cut a man's breeches?

132
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,244
- Uh... uh, sir? That is not an area
that braves infection with grace!

133
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,206
No one understands

134
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,419
A wanted man

135
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:19,427
'Cause you live by a code
Known by the ghosts of the dead

136
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,847
And you gotta keep movin'
With that price on your head

137
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,351
Still no time for a friend

138
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,770
Dammit.

139
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,566
Get outta my way. I'll shoot ya.
When any stranger could be the end

140
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,110
Move, move.

141
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,696
- Well, Mrs. Taylor, assembling
the drive in that old windmill,

142
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,366
it would be a chore even for a man
well-versed in matters mechanical.

143
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,369
- If you're referring to my husband,
you know he's long gone.

144
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,329
- No. No, no, no.
I'm only saying

145
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,373
that is mechanically complex.
Perhaps you need...

146
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,625
- Pants! I need pants.
- Do you mind?

147
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,335
I'll just be a moment,

148
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,920
Mr. Montana.

149
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,256
Pardon my idiot partner's rudeness.

150
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,719
Can I offer you a splash
of my best Scottish tea?

151
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,887
And some delicious ground nuts?

152
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,182
- We specifically agreed
that I was to sell the dry goods

153
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,642
and you were to sell...
- Boys, please,

154
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,519
I have to get a crop in this season.

155
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,690
The part will have a pointy thing
that goes in here. Please?

156
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,942
- Very well, Mrs. Taylor.
Now, you have to give me

157
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,027
a part name,
so I know what to order.

158
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,113
You just need a shear pin, all right?

159
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,282
- Like you know.
- Yeah, I do. Now, pants.

160
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,325
- What kind of trousers
can we order for you today,

161
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,994
Mr. Montana?
- Order?

162
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,454
No, I need 'em now.

163
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,540
That butcher up there
cut my pants, on pro bono.

164
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,210
- Yes. Well, all our apparel
is purchased on order.

165
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,963
- What the hell kinda general store
is this?

166
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,631
They stock soap.

167
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,717
Soap and escargots.

168
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,385
Lots and lots of escargots!

169
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,638
- I specifically ordered tin nails
and they sent me tin snails.

170
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:50,560
- So do I absolutely need a shear pin,
or can I just use a nail or something?

171
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,354
- You could use your nose,
for all I care.

172
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,245
- Talk has it
that you're the Montana Kid.

173
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,872
Thas right.

174
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,835
- "Among America's
most notorious gunslingers are:

175
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:20,882
Wild Bill Hickok, John Wesley Harding
and the Montana Kid."

176
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,259
Are you that "the Montana Kid"?

177
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,595
I reckon so.

178
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,057
Says here you killed six men.

179
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,267
Eleven.

180
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,562
- You don't look like a kid.
- Nicknames have a way of sticking.

181
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,523
Decades, even.
Ain't that right?

182
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,149
I guess so.

183
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,777
- Is it true you're proposing
a gunfight today, with Jack?

184
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,239
Sundown.

185
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,455
- Showdown with the Montana Kid!
- Right here in Barclay's Brush!

186
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,958
- The town hasn't seen
this much excitement

187
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,127
since Larry accidentally set fire
to his prized ewe!

188
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,421
Can Jack duel with my Winchester?

189
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,257
'Cause he doesn't have one.
- Hang on, hang on!

190
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,467
What about mine?
Mine's practically brand new. See?

191
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,137
Whas wrong with you people?

192
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,515
- Yah, whas wrong with you?
Is up to Jack, no?

193
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,225
And he might like my shotgun best.

194
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,144
- Is not a turkey shoot.
Is a gunfight. He needs a pistol.

195
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,563
Where the hell are you from?

196
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,106
- Peterborough.
- Moncton.

197
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,109
- Uppsala.
- Any of you got a Hog Leg like this?

198
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,946
- Well, thas a cattleman's revolver,
isn't it?

199
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,283
Ow. A Peacemaker.

200
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,743
An Equalizer.

201
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,495
A Widowmaker.

202
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,622
- Stop that.
- Yeah...

203
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,126
- Well, does anyone got one?
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,794
When the cowboys ride through,

205
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,463
they have pistols. And rum.
But otherwise, um...

206
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,758
- No, truth is,
I don't know anyone who has, uh...

207
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,219
uh, what do call it?
- A Peacemaker!

208
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,429
Stop it.

209
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,848
- There's just not much call
for one around here.

210
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,017
We got rifles for huntin',
shotguns for birds.

211
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,019
Pistols, well,
they're just for... you know.

212
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,314
- Killing people.
Seems to me Jack not having a gun

213
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,609
is your problem, not his.
- Oh, my problem is you.

214
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,030
- So why don't you just shoot him?
- Why don't I just shoot you?

215
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,948
Same reason.

216
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,533
I'm unarmed.

217
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,952
So that is the code, isn't it?

218
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,455
You can't shoot an unarmed man.
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,415
I'm thinkin' I can make an exception.

220
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,462
Tell you what... shear pin,

221
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,965
I've got a pistol you can use.
I mean, it needs fixing, though.

222
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,176
The handle's cracked
and the hammer's broke.

223
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,264
Fine.

224
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,144
- And you don't get it for nothing.
Deal is, you get the gun

225
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,023
if you help me
get my windmill up and running.

226
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,650
- Why don't you get your husband
to get it up?

227
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,235
Do you want your showdown or not?

228
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,472
- Hey, you wanna go back?
By some direct conspiracy of fate,

229
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,767
it seems you missed a bump.

230
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,978
Ow!!! Thas it!

231
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,646
Thas it! Whoa!

232
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,439
Whoa! Stop!
- Whoa...

233
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,817
Stop! Ah...

234
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,278
I think we'll take it... by foot
from here.

235
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,072
Suit yourself.

236
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,449
Is, uh, just over that ridge.

237
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,077
And stay off that horse.

238
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,621
Come on, Peaches.

239
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,377
- What is it with these people, huh?
No sidearms,

240
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,421
a medico who shreds your clothing,

241
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,506
a saloon with...
teacups and catalogues,

242
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,175
and that...

243
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,553
woman.

244
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,346
A mouthpiece.

245
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,854
Hey, I'm not talkin' to myself here.
Get up with me.

246
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,190
Come on.

247
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,777
So what do you figure?
How far are we from a real country?

248
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,364
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

249
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,367
You're right, he'll be comin' for me.

250
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,163
Ten years of doggin' me -
he's not gonna let a border stop him.

251
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,207
We'll make tracks
as soon as we get things squared.

252
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,710
Well, you know,

253
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,172
you're not so sweet-smellin' yourself,
pal.

254
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:32,175
You got mealy old carrot breath.

255
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,178
Well, you do.

256
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,013
You stink.

257
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,856
Put your horse in here.

258
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,192
It should be safe.

259
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,612
Bunk in there.
There's an oil lamp

260
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,156
just inside the door.
- Outhouse is made out of dirt.

261
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,826
- It was good enough for me
and my husband for over a year.

262
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,871
- Where's the gun?
- Time enough for that in the morning.

263
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,624
- We had a deal
and I want that gun...

264
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,292
right now.

265
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,711
Keeps whas left of your pants on.

266
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,431
Here.

267
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,559
Thas bad.

268
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,895
Why do you even bother
carrying this?

269
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,565
- To frighten away bothersome folk
mostly.

270
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:33,236
Pistol's not just for killing people.
Is also real good for scaring 'em.

271
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,697
This isn't scary.

272
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,203
There was a time

273
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,375
When you believed

274
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,045
When everything

275
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,506
Was springtime green

276
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,967
Before you learned
that life was mean

277
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,969
And nothin's

278
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,179
Ever what it seems

279
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,768
Mother of Mary.

280
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,862
Ow.

281
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,242
You sure that ain't dry?
- There's water!

282
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,827
Is just deep!

283
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,580
Thas why this windmill's
gonna be a godsend!

284
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,460
See, I figure if we construct
the windmill here,

285
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:35,548
then the water'll be convenient
to both the livestock and the crop.

286
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,133
Well, I'd... I'd put the...

287
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,969
the windmill right here
on top of the well.

288
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,512
Thad be the shorter straw,

289
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,849
then you could pipe the water
wherever you want - the house,

290
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,852
the pens, out in the field.

291
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,398
- You volunteering to lay all that pipe,
shear pin?

292
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,983
Oh, no, ma'am, no.

293
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,987
The deal was,
just help build the windmill.

294
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,032
- Well, then why don't you do that
and run along.

295
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,992
Stow your ideas.

296
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,917
Mouthpiece.

297
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,772
What... what is this supposed to be?

298
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,232
Meat?

299
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,235
Hmm.

300
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,031
Mm...

301
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,664
Argh, you know, is really
unpleasant to sit downwind of you.

302
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,502
What is that stench, anyway?

303
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,341
- Before they got to hangin' me,
they cleaned my plow pretty good.

304
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,387
They lashed me to a stumpin' post
in a pig pen,

305
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,807
left me there for three days,
waiting for him.

306
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,475
Who's him?

307
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,519
There's a bounty on my head.

308
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,897
Is common knowledge
north of the Mason-Dixon

309
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,942
that there's a particularly hostile
disfigured individual

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,903
who's been huntin' for that reward
for a long, long time.

311
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,490
So these folk thought it prudent
that they'd wait,

312
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,326
and then they would split the bounty
with him.

313
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,204
After the lynchin', the party got bored
and they kinda wandered off,

314
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,791
then the other half decided to proceed,
but they didn't know nothing

315
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,585
about a hanging,
so they picked a dead tree.

316
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,839
- So why is there a price on your head?
Huh?

317
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,883
You shoot someone
who was tending to your horse?

318
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,683
- You shouldn't make light
of what you know nothin' about.

319
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,635
Ow!

320
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,845
Shoot!

321
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,598
Ah... Well, good day, eh?

322
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,934
You, uh, hoofing
all the way in from Jane's?

323
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,020
- Yeah. I started early.
Skipped breakfast.

324
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,147
Is funny you should mention that,

325
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,567
because the missus would like
to have you for dinner this evening.

326
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,110
The truth is,

327
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,404
she is chomping at the bit

328
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,115
to meet
a bona-fide American gunfighter.

329
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,452
- She's not plannin'
on servin' that thing, is she?

330
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,620
Uh, no. Uh...

331
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,331
but I reckon...

332
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,875
Jane's cooking
probably suits you just fine.

333
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,127
Shall we say 6:00?
- Yeah.

334
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,420
Yeah.

335
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,882
- Isn't, uh, skinnin' stuff
kind of an odd pastime

336
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,967
for a healer?
- Not really.

337
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,097
'Cause once a being's dead,
is nothin' but dead.

338
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,391
But I suppose you know that.

339
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,354
- Whoa!
- Pardon me.

340
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:30,533
Oh, my, thas gonna leave a mark.

341
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,000
Hey, Mr. Montana, please,

342
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,961
sidle on up to the counter.

343
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,963
Perhaps I can interest you in...

344
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,215
this.
Is a, uh, full-bodied little number.

345
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,884
The bouques a tad intimidating...

346
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,262
- No, I just need...
- Oh, no, no, no.

347
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,847
It contains laudanum,
don't you know.

348
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,433
A couple of these,
you'll be baying at the moon.

349
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,227
- You're selling spirits!
- Cough medication, Claude.

350
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,272
General stores sell cough medication.
- Idiot!

351
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,107
Look...

352
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,234
I need a part for a gun.

353
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,611
Is a hammer

354
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,198
for a Navy Colt.44 calibre.
And I need bullets.

355
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,077
Not that many. Id be a miracle
if he gets off one shot.

356
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,496
Yeah, showdown with a.44!

357
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,582
- Stop it.
- Mm...

358
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,711
Uh-oh.

359
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,716
Oh, no, gimme those.

360
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,468
Gimme those.

361
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,888
- I am warning you.
- Unarmed!

362
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,183
Shut up. If you step out that door...

363
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,853
Damn.

364
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,022
Just follow my finger to the...

365
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,276
Okay, just follow my finger
to the right.

366
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,029
Just follow my finger to the right.

367
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:56,368
- My grandfather says he would
be honoured to repair your pants.

368
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:00,706
He says you may wear a pair of his
until yours are repaired.

369
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,250
Yeah, yeah.

370
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,544
Look, look.

371
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:09,131
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

372
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,483
Railroad workers.

373
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,819
My grandparents let them rest here
between construction lines.

374
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,198
Giving food and shelter to these people
is an honour.

375
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,037
They no speaky Englishy.

376
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,891
- My grandfather says
he would be honoured

377
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,309
if you would use this tub

378
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,019
for bathing.

379
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,438
Mm.

380
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,526
Ahem. It is that bad, isn't it?

381
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,380
Never compromise a man's lifeline.

382
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,507
- I'm sorry!
Grandpa told me to give you food!

383
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,010
I thought you were asleep!

384
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,641
Ahem. Hey, listen, listen, kid.

385
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,351
Is all right.

386
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,186
Is all right. Honest.

387
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,314
Hey, look at me.

388
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,402
You know, that chow looks pretty good.

389
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,947
Do you think maybe
you could get me a fresh bowl?

390
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,001
Ladies.

391
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,382
Oh, don't start.

392
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,928
Why are you even here?
- Standing invitation every Wednesday.

393
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,181
Doc tells me we're dining partners.
- Just great.

394
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,433
- Nice blouse, by the way.
- Okay, shut up.

395
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,310
Les get this over with.

396
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,520
- My mother wore
something like that once.

397
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,189
- Very funny.
- Well, she did!

398
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,149
- Well, come on in.
- Yeah.

399
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,817
Is that a blouse?

400
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,996
- Be sure to save room for dessert,
Mr. Montana.

401
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,707
Beatrice brought a dish
of her apple cobbler.

402
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,752
It is a treat beyond compare!
- Oh, is nothing.

403
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,129
Beth is being humble
in her praise.

404
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,757
She's the real baker
in Barclay's Brush.

405
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,550
Come July,
when the strawberries ripen,

406
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,554
she makes a strawberry-rhubarb pie
you'd simply kill for.

407
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,268
Hmm.

408
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,687
Beatrice.

409
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:14,483
Uh, how about the question
of how many men you've shot?

410
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,653
The Canadian Monthly
specifically reports six.

411
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,156
- It must be so exciting,
living wild on the open range,

412
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,118
happy and free,
sleeping under a canopy of stars,

413
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,786
every moment an adventure?

414
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,664
- The Wild West!
- Stop it.

415
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,334
- Larry, we talked about this.
Please don't badger our guest.

416
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,840
Ahem.

417
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,885
Eleven.

418
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,058
I have killed 11 men.

419
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,978
And they each earned their bullet
of their own accord.

420
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,149
I've been called out four times.

421
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,234
I've responded in self-defence twice.

422
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:00,654
- I think duelling
is incredibly romantic!

423
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,991
Dear...

424
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,202
- Three men called me a cheat
in a Kansas City card game.

425
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,205
And one time I came across
a man beating a dog.

426
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,333
Bad. I mean, real bad.

427
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,543
Gravy?

428
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,838
But the first man I killed, well...

429
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,340
the first man I killed

430
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,842
killed my pa.

431
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,262
He had black eyes, black beard,
black soul.

432
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,139
He and my pa got into it

433
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,767
over an unbranded calf
my pa knew to be his.

434
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,312
So they settled matters with fisticuffs
and my pa gave him a whoopin'.

435
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,063
But as he rode away,

436
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:38,275
that lying coward shot him in the back.

437
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,197
That is so sad!

438
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,615
- Yeah.
So the next day,

439
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,326
I rode up to his porch.
I called him out,

440
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,912
and my first shot
punched him in the gut.

441
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,335
Now, if you know
anything about killing -

442
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,170
I'm sure you all do -

443
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,547
you know that a gut shot
is the ugliest way

444
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,091
to do it. Keeps you livin'
just long enough to...

445
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,635
to experience

446
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,304
every second of pain.

447
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,182
And after an hour

448
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,435
of him kinda whinin' and moanin'
and whimperin',

449
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,480
I had it.
So I shot him right here.

450
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,233
That was that.

451
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,026
He was dead.

452
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,576
- So then Jack
will make it an even dozen.

453
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,578
He's not shooting Jack.

454
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,206
Yeah, I am.

455
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,208
I tell you what...

456
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:39,253
I'd kill for some more potatoes.

457
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,609
Ah... Dang.

458
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,909
Good morning, sir!

459
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,203
Ahem. Corporal J.T. Kent,

460
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,039
Northwest Mounted Police,
Fort McNeil troop.

461
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,212
And this is my liaison and guide,
K'Wala.

462
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,964
People call me Two Dogs.

463
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,967
- And?
- As per the standing directive

464
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,344
of Her Majesty's government
in the Dominion of Canada,

465
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,805
I am making the rounds
of the southwest sector

466
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,975
of our allotted region.

467
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,685
Thank you.

468
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,646
And?

469
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,690
And, as part of my rounds,

470
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:46,153
I'm under instructions
to check in with all adults -

471
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,697
men... new men... and women -

472
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,325
and households in my zone.

473
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,410
So?

474
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,661
So.

475
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,790
How's it going?
- Good.

476
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,751
- Any problems?
- None.

477
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,502
- Concerns?
- No.

478
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,173
Ahem. Very well, then.

479
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,341
Sign here, please.

480
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,676
What is this?

481
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,220
- A rounds journal.
You sign it after I check in.

482
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:15,891
- You ain't from around here, are ya?
- America.

483
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,810
Oh... Still have to sign.

484
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,439
We need your true full name,
please.

485
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,526
Mm...

486
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,988
- Not a smuggler, are you?
- No.

487
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,990
- Whiskey trader?
- No.

488
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,284
- Horse thief.
- No.

489
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,997
All right. Good day, sir.

490
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,375
Oh, one more thing...

491
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,877
Sean.
- Sean?!

492
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,879
How long will you be staying

493
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,464
in Canada?

494
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,384
- I could leave by sundown,
if you'd loan me that gun of yours

495
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,637
for a spell.
- Regrettably, I must decline, sir.

496
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,223
That would be a flagrant contravention

497
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,350
of rule number 44
of the constables' code

498
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,936
of behaviour,
hygiene and equipment care.

499
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,938
Thas, uh, rule 45, there, chief.

500
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,857
Okay. Thank you, K'Wala.

501
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,945
Ahem. Miss Taylor?

502
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,535
- You gotta remember
to tie up your horse, there, chief.

503
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,579
- Okay, K'Wala, just...
Thank you.

504
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,999
Jonathan?

505
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,253
Oh... no.

506
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,547
Ma'am.

507
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,217
Sean.

508
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,344
Two Dogs.

509
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,847
Hey, Sean,

510
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,433
break's over.
- Whoa!

511
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,476
Whoa! Come on! Come back!

512
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,825
Hang on.

513
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,121
Hold on. Here you go.

514
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,498
- I'm gonna fall!
- You won't. I won't let you.

515
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,167
Come on. Thas it.

516
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,004
I got ya.

517
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,427
See? You're gonna be okay.

518
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,722
Thas bad.

519
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,351
- Oh.
- Ah!

520
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,395
Oh, Lord.

521
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,022
- Ow.
- Is it broken?

522
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,565
Oh, I don't reckon so.

523
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,735
Pissing elks! It bleeding well is!

524
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,121
- I think I see why...
you're so convinced

525
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,332
I won't be shootin' that hoof-shaper.

526
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,834
You been conspirin'
to cripple my gun hand.

527
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,462
- If you'd been helping me
like you promised,

528
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,005
I wouldn't have fallen.

529
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,258
- That what happened
to your husband?

530
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,428
Did you accidentally kill him
while he was tendin' to the chores?

531
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,849
It wasn't an accident.

532
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,643
What?

533
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,603
It wasn't an accident.

534
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,025
I thought we came out here
to start a farm and a family.

535
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,655
Turns out that put the fear in him.

536
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,032
Took to wearing that gun,

537
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,951
swaggering around like some...

538
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,536
dime-novel jackass.

539
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,539
He became a horrible drunk, too.

540
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,583
Then, one day,

541
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,379
I realized I could run the farm
a hell of a lot easier by myself.

542
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,797
So I shot him.

543
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,674
You shot him?

544
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,677
Yeah.

545
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,055
With his own gun.

546
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,682
Square in the gut.

547
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,562
Now, if you know
anything about killing -

548
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,355
and I'm sure that you do -

549
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,942
you'll know that a gut shot
is the ugliest way to do it.

550
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,736
Took him... hours to die.

551
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,322
Hmm...

552
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,040
'Afternoon, Larry!

553
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,251
Howdy, Jane!

554
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,044
Hey, Sean!

555
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,341
- Better hop to it
if you're gonna make it by 6:00!

556
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,969
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'll see ya there!

557
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,815
- Aristotle said,
"We are what we do repeatedly.

558
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,109
We do not act rightly because..."
- This ain't a social,

559
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,195
this is schoolin'.
- I never said it was a social,

560
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,405
I said "gathering."
- And it cost you two bits

561
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,032
you paid to listen...
- Shhh!

562
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,742
- Mm... What is wrong
with these people?

563
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,911
...The very truth
of who we are as people

564
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,163
is defined by what we do
again and again.

565
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,373
Aristotle would say

566
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,710
that since Larry farms every day,
Larry is a farmer.

567
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,378
Far-mer.

568
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,880
Yes.

569
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,798
And one who teaches every day

570
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,759
is therefore a teacher.
- Tea-cher.

571
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,510
Aristotle would also say

572
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,305
it is about who we are as people.

573
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,600
A man might claim to be virtuous,

574
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,479
but he is not virtuous unless
he consistently acts with great virtue.

575
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,147
Yes, Jack.

576
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,360
- So les say a man shoots 11 men
and then he says

577
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,279
each man deserves to die,
according to, um...

578
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,490
- Aristotle.
...A- Aristotle,

579
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,284
is he still a common killer?

580
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,703
Whad you just call me?

581
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,956
- Killer.
- No, before that.

582
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,124
- Common.
- Yeah, thas it.

583
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,169
You just stepped over the line, again.

584
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,545
Outside.

585
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,922
Unarmed.

586
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,675
- What is that? You cough,
you say "unarmed."

587
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,510
Do you think I can't hear that?
- Sean?

588
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,514
Is there something you would like
to add to this discussion?

589
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,810
- Kil-ler.
- All right, stop. Thas enough.

590
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,019
Sean?

591
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,939
Look,

592
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,525
I see fit to live by a code.

593
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,028
By a set of unspoken laws that men -
real men - understand.

594
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,449
Now, just 'cause I got the mettle
to stand up and make things square,

595
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,035
thas not a reason
to brand me common,

596
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,454
I don't care what that book says.

597
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,290
- Common, uncommon;
you're still a killer,

598
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,208
and you're set on killing me.

599
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,377
- He's not killing anyone.
- Oh, yes,

600
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,421
I am.
- Oh, believe him,

601
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,507
Mrs. Taylor, that gun'll get fixed
and he'll call me out.

602
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,843
And we all know damn good and well

603
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,845
that I don't stand a chance.

604
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,680
He'll shoot me dead.

605
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,433
And there's nothing uncommon
about that.

606
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,059
I'll just be number 12.
- Well, Canadian Monthly

607
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,187
would technically make you seven.
- At least I know I'll be going

608
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,897
to a better place
than you'll ever see!

609
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,400
You don't know nothin' about me.

610
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,448
Darn it! I...

611
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,076
I can see right inside you.
Is as plain

612
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,704
as that Colt
you like to wear on your hip.

613
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,082
Gun's a magnet for death.
Hell, some would say

614
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,709
you're lookin' to die.

615
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,340
Thas just wrong.

616
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,925
A gun is just a tool.
Is like...

617
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,886
any other tool.

618
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,263
A tool designed for killin' people.

619
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,266
- No, is all what you do with it.
- Well, yes.

620
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,686
- But if a man walks into my shop
- Oh!

621
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,355
He might kill me!
- Shovel could kill you.

622
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,357
He could hit you on the head with it.

623
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,442
- Or jab you.
- You could say that about anything.

624
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,070
About a rock, even.
- But nobody ever comes in with a rock.

625
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,738
Besides, a rock is not a tool.

626
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,074
- Tell the Indians that.
They've been using rocks as tools

627
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,742
for years.
- Yeah, you could smash somebody

628
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,994
in the face with a rock.
- Or jab someone.

629
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,288
- Can't stab somebody with a rock.
- Tell the Indians.

630
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,624
They've been stabbing people with rocks
for years.

631
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,294
- What about a rope?
Hitting and jabbing somebody

632
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,671
with a rope wouldn't do anything.
- Don't be so sure.

633
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,423
- You could strangle someone
with a rope.

634
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,718
- You could take it and rub it
over somebody's eye, pushing hard.

635
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,810
Ahem.

636
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,812
Tell me somethin'.

637
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:03,441
Is this entire country insane,
or is it just this town?

638
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,151
- Seems you have quite a history.
- Oh.

639
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,987
Oh, I see.
You've come to run me out of town.

640
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,364
Mm.

641
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,324
- You haven't broken any laws
in this country.

642
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,909
And as far as we're aware,

643
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,787
there are no extradition warrants
out for your arrest.

644
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,332
- So I'm free to go about my business?
- As for this...

645
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,544
showdown with Jack
everyone's talking about,

646
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,796
you best know
there are no duelling laws

647
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,881
in this country.
We call it murder.

648
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,012
Don't you dare to even hurt her,
Mr. Kid.

649
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,517
'Evening!
Company's having a dance Saturday

650
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,686
to welcome the new provincial
constabulary to the area.

651
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,356
Opportunity to wear that
lovely blue dress again, Miss Taylor.

652
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,067
- Thas so sweet
that you remember, Jonathan!

653
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,569
Well, not something you forget.

654
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,404
Well, thank you, Corporal.

655
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,408
I will definitely try to attend.
- Okay.

656
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,369
Ah!
- What do you say, shear pin?

657
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,874
Can you dance?
- Oh. I'm sorry to disappoint, ma'am,

658
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,169
but I intend
to be a charmin' memory by then.

659
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,837
Hope to see you Saturday.

660
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,214
All are welcome.

661
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,549
Sir.

662
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,834
Just...

663
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,586
answer...

664
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,631
question!
Seen... him?!

665
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,090
Seen him?!

666
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,718
You find that distracting?

667
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,929
- Yes!
- I know I do.

668
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,432
I did.

669
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,601
Now, let me explain.

670
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:06,397
We are business folk.

671
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:07,857
We catch bad men.

672
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,443
And we get paid for our efforts.

673
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,320
That man in particular

674
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,448
is worth a considerable sum
to our enterprise.

675
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,992
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

676
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,495
Have you seen this man?

677
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,706
He say we see no one!

678
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,124
No one!

679
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,794
No one, no one...

680
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,676
She has.

681
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,011
Get her.

682
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,980
- Oh, yeah, Cutler's on our trail.
I can feel him.

683
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,648
We gotta change tack.

684
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,694
All right, here's the plan.

685
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,154
We'll ride east...

686
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,740
and then south.

687
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,494
When Cutler picks up the scent,
which he will,

688
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,329
he will start northwest.

689
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,164
He always sweeps northwest.
Why?

690
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:08,751
Because he is stupid
and he is predictable and, well...

691
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,296
ever since I shot his ear off,

692
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,340
he kinda...
he kinda leans to the left.

693
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,719
What?

694
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,702
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

695
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,956
We will stay just...
just a little bit longer,

696
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,334
but it has got to be said...

697
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,671
It has got to be said, Glue,
that you are getting very soft.

698
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,923
I mean, very, very soft.
Yes.

699
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,268
You know, nothin' should surprise me
around here,

700
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,021
but that is a, uh... peculiar perch

701
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,899
upon which to take
one's evening coffee.

702
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,569
Ah.

703
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,864
You're all right?

704
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,287
Well...

705
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,086
...is a nice spot.

706
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,505
I feel safe up here.

707
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,924
Is where I'd come
when Stewart got drunk.

708
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,718
Yes. Yeah, that part was true.

709
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,303
Oh.

710
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,103
- And when he got real mean,
I'd just pull the ladder up and wait.

711
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,231
He'd be too liquored
to climb up after me.

712
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:57,026
In the months
before he left for good...

713
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,697
...he'd say
that I wasn't even worth the effort.

714
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:03,116
Do you like that?

715
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:07,370
Not even worth the effort to beat.

716
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,342
What Jack said in the schoolhouse...

717
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,638
Well, was he right about you?

718
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,767
Are you looking to get killed?

719
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:45,408
- What would one wear
to a Northwest Mounted shindig?

720
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,630
Oh...

721
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,551
You look...

722
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,553
You look very...

723
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,309
The cars ready.

724
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,358
You look rather presentable yourself.

725
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,570
But I was growing quite fond
of the Oriental look.

726
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,405
Well, thank you.

727
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:29,202
I had to eat an entire crate of snails
before Carl'd give me the loan of this.

728
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,163
- I don't know if that makes me
flattered or alarmed.

729
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,320
Whoo!

730
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,039
Ah!

731
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,084
Sorry.

732
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,460
Pardon me.

733
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,295
Whoa!

734
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,257
Is my father's.

735
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,427
Ahem.

736
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,098
'Evening, Miss Taylor.
- Ah!

737
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,392
So pleased that you could attend.

738
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,395
- Why, thank you for inviting us,
Jonathan.

739
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,439
Us?

740
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,108
- - Ah, General.
- Whoo!

741
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,611
Oh, uh, hello, Sean.

742
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,447
Good that you could come.

743
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,328
- Aren't you lookin' right regal.
You know, is a particular breed of man

744
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,747
who can carry off an outfit like that.
- Huh.

745
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,500
So, Corporal, did...

746
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,919
you want to show me
the dance floor?

747
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,048
- Is an old saying,
but true nonetheless:

748
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,301
You dance with who brung you.

749
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,219
So, you two, please,

750
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:13,431
be my guests.
We'll chat later.

751
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,519
Hello, Beatrice! Hello, Larry!

752
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,396
Oh, howdy, Jane. Sean.

753
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,232
Wow, aren't you two a sight.

754
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,902
I'm so pleased to see you both.

755
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,196
Is all I could do to tear him away

756
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,365
from that damn stump.

757
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,908
Hey, American.

758
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,203
Oh, I see you brought your pie.

759
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,711
You armed?

760
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:29,090
I've got pie.

761
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,884
- 'Cause you know is against the law
for a foreign national

762
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,261
to carry a weapon
in Her Majesty's military posts.

763
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,764
- Yeah, I heard.
Hey, whoa, mind the haunch.

764
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,058
- No gun.
- You know what we do

765
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,435
to murderers
who ride up into our country?

766
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,397
- I never committed murder
against no man.

767
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,904
- I thought you Canadians
were supposed to be polite.

768
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,865
Ah!

769
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,873
Ten hut!

770
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,792
Ooh.

771
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,752
Howdy, General.

772
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,548
Whas happened here?

773
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,467
- Just a little Northwest warning
to our guest... sir.

774
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,637
- Warning? This man
is under no legal restriction here.

775
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,472
Corporal, he's the Montana Kid.

776
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,516
Best send his type a clear message...

777
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,646
Not on my watch.

778
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,733
Is not just about rules, Jonathan.

779
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,860
Why don't you go cross-reference
the troop manifest or...

780
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,278
something?

781
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,991
- Mr. Lafferty, would you like
to register a formal complaint

782
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,243
against Constable Hughes?
I would be happy

783
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,078
to issue a statement as your witness.

784
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:45,666
- - No. Only thing I'd like
- he hits like a girl.

785
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,544
Then,

786
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,213
this unfortunate incident...

787
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,090
is closed.

788
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,014
Now pick up that pie.

789
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,515
Ooh!

790
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,436
Corporal?

791
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,022
General?
Jonathan, come here.

792
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,528
- On behalf of the superintendent
and all officers under his command,

793
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,030
I want to apologize...

794
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,532
I need your help here, Jonathan.

795
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,077
Would you, uh...
take over for me?

796
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,705
I fear that Mrs. Taylor here
will be plenty disappointed.

797
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,541
I banged my knee up
on a little, uh...

798
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,961
alfresco dancing lesson.

799
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,588
Y- yes.

800
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,964
Uh, yes.

801
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,383
It would be my honour and privilege.

802
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,429
Mm... Mm, laudanum.

803
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,806
Ma'am.

804
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,637
Tsk. 'Evening, Jack.

805
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,222
'Evening.

806
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,352
How goes the repairs
on that old Patterson?

807
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,646
Is coming along just fine, Jack.

808
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,526
Hmm.

809
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,921
That was the most fun I've had

810
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:40,007
in a long, long, long, long...

811
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,383
...time.

812
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,761
You know, you are looking
pretty spry

813
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,222
for someone with a...
banged-up leg.

814
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,390
Hmm.

815
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,975
Ooh.

816
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,946
- You know, what you did back there
was very kind.

817
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,617
Some might even say...

818
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,410
it was noble.

819
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,417
Again, I, uh...

820
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:20,422
...I wanna thank you
for inviting me to your stomp.

821
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,051
I should tend that horse.

822
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,390
You're unarmed,

823
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,308
Montana Kid.

824
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:32,851
Ahem. Jane...

825
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,855
...you don't wanna start this.
- Yeah, I do.

826
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,485
I think is best that you yield,

827
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,279
and take it...

828
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,072
like a man.

829
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,962
Ah... g'day, Sean.

830
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,382
- Are you really tryin' to get rid
of that big old beast,

831
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,259
or you just dodgin' the missus?

832
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,346
I've been keen to get rid of her.

833
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,306
The stump, I mean.
- Oh.

834
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,976
Think I might be able
to give you a hand with that.

835
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,062
Ah, thanks, Sean.

836
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,522
Yeah... Hell, yeah.

837
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,816
That would be greatly appreciated.

838
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,053
- Good morning, Sean.
- Good mornin'.

839
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,476
- Good morning, Sean.
Great fun last night.

840
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,896
But it looks like they took your gun
at the fort.

841
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,482
Is a shame.
- Uh, no, they didn't, actually.

842
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,443
I guess I just forgot to strap it on.

843
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,897
Jack.

844
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,735
Hoof looks good.

845
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,044
'Afternoon, Miss Alice.

846
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,671
Good day, Jack.

847
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,642
We are what we do, Sean.

848
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,730
A blacksmith smiths iron.

849
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,262
I...

850
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,638
I made dinner.

851
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,974
I thought maybe...
we could eat in my cabin.

852
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,687
- No, thank you.
I'm gonna be ridin' out in the morning.

853
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:27,980
I thought that maybe...

854
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,941
...you'd wanna stay a bit.

855
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,443
You thought wrong.

856
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,487
Everyone around here did.

857
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,956
We had a deal.

858
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,172
Hey!

859
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,591
You get your gunfight
after my windmill

860
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,176
is up and running.

861
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,201
You tell me why.

862
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:09,498
I mean, why can't you just...

863
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,249
let it go?

864
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,001
'Cause I can't.

865
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:19,049
'Cause if I let it go now, then...

866
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,135
I shoulןve let it go
when them three guys in Missouri

867
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,304
called me a cheat.
And you tell me,

868
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,515
they died for nothing?

869
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,518
And if I let them guys in Missouri go,
then...

870
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,188
I shoulןve let it go
when that man was whuppin' that dog.

871
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,066
Now, does that sound right to you?

872
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,235
Beatin' on a helpless dog?

873
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,157
If I was able

874
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:47,285
to let that man go
for beatin' on that mutt,

875
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,829
then...

876
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,289
...there sure as hell is no reason...

877
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:55,502
I couldn't have just walked away
when I was called out in Wyoming,

878
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,505
or Santa Fי and...

879
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,048
twice in Arizona.

880
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,470
If I was so damn smart
to walk away

881
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,848
when I was called out,
then I shoulןve had the wherewithal

882
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,475
to not use my gun in self-defence -
twice.

883
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,937
And if I shoulןve been able

884
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,440
to avoid that,
then there's no arguable reason

885
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,234
why I couldn't have
just gone to the sheriff...

886
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,195
instead of killin' that man
that whupped my pa.

887
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,365
I thought he shot your pa.

888
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,617
Just beat him up.

889
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,205
Broke his jaw and a bloody nose, but...

890
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:37,252
"Taught a common thief a lesson,"
he said.

891
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,795
How do you like that?

892
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,592
Common.

893
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,220
He was anything but common.

894
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,058
He was my pa.

895
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,606
When I shot that man...

896
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,986
...like it or not,

897
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:05,363
this is my path.

898
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,033
This is what I do.

899
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,660
And I am what I do.

900
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,956
'Cause it can all be lost

901
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,170
In the blink of an eye

902
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:28,595
Is the longer years
gun by your side

903
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,558
There's a tombstone waitin'
with your name inscribed

904
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:37,479
But they'll never take you

905
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,189
Alive

906
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:48,406
Under those wild mountain skies

907
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:32,284
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

908
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:46,006
- Hi, Sean.
Your clothes look nice.

909
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,383
Oh, Miss Adell,

910
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,511
I reckon we're lookin'
at the Montana Kid.

911
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,603
Get it on your belt.

912
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,855
You go home.
- But...

913
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,481
why?

914
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,358
I said go home now.

915
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:06,818
All right.

916
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,790
- You did a hell of a job,
I'll give you that.

917
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,667
This was a mess.

918
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,545
Put it in your belt.

919
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,589
When you pull back,
don't jam your thumb in the hammer.

920
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,591
You'll blow your nuts off.

921
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,761
Sage advice, but I don't think that...

922
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,764
I said get in the house now!!!

923
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:41,061
Just plain mean, you son of a bitch!

924
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,022
Yeah...

925
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,524
now you're gettin' in the spirit.

926
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,862
All right...

927
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,989
throw down.

928
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,408
You'll kill me.

929
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,787
I said draw, Jack.

930
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,414
Well, what about Jane?

931
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,880
Look about you, Jack.

932
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,468
People around here been hankerin'
to see a man shot dead in the street.

933
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,261
Best not disappoint. So...

934
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,181
pull your weapon.

935
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,894
Pull it.

936
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,774
Pull it.

937
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,910
Point it!

938
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,253
Cock the hammer.

939
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,718
Cock that gun, or I swear
the next one'll blow your head off.

940
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,683
Pull it.

941
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,520
Do it!

942
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,190
Do it!!!
- I am!

943
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,359
Pull it harder!

944
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,319
I am! Is stuck!

945
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,575
Goddamn.

946
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,243
It was workin' fine

947
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:23,079
last night. I don't...

948
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,581
The short stroke?

949
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,042
Did you pull the hammer
all the way back?

950
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,169
- Yes.
- Well, maybe...

951
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,297
Sometimes these conversions,
they get kinda fiddly.

952
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,550
Get all grimed up, you know, with...

953
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,678
- Oh!
- Oh, there we go.

954
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,096
Ow.

955
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,431
Ooh.

956
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,392
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

957
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,854
- Ooh.
Oh...

958
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:51,483
Ow!!!
- There's more in there.

959
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,985
Bullet fragmented.
- I'm really sorry, Jack.

960
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,653
Doc! What happened?!

961
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,533
Oh, thank God. I thought you...

962
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,039
You shot Jack?!

963
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,876
You no-good, poxy, bilious...

964
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,336
Ja...

965
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,837
...son of a weasel!

966
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:14,964
Whoa!

967
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,758
Hey! Just... Hey...

968
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,219
Stop. Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

969
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:20,720
This was an accident.

970
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,263
- An accident?
- Yeah.

971
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,848
Oh, thank God.

972
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,893
- Oh, yes, imagine my relief
at being shot in the ass -

973
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,229
by accident!

974
01:08:29,396 --> 01:08:32,065
- Wait a minute.
This puts you square with Jack.

975
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,775
Code-of-the-West-wise.

976
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,486
Mm, I suppose so.

977
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,073
- Suppo... You suppose?!
You shot me in the ahhh!!!

978
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:45,078
What?

979
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,621
What is it?

980
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,248
Horses and guns.

981
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,041
Thas bad.
- Who is it?

982
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,543
Do you know them?

983
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,671
- Ben Cutler, bounty hunter, murderer,
tenacious bastard.

984
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:59,134
I'm surprised you haven't read about him
in Canadian Monthly.

985
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,511
- There's four of them,
you damn fool. Are you that good?

986
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,222
- I don't know...
- - Run.

987
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,808
I want you to go. Please.

988
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,185
Please.

989
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,445
- Alrighty. Give me 15 minutes
and send them in the same direction.

990
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:21,573
I'll lead them outta here so far,
they won't come back.

991
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:23,366
And don't leave this house.

992
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,475
Come on, you deaf mule.
I'm doing the clicking thing.

993
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,936
Come on.

994
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,285
They're lyin'.

995
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,330
Montana Kid was seen
wearing Chinaman clothes.

996
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,832
Get outta here, both of you!

997
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,792
He's here all right, Ben.

998
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,212
Name's written in this here book.

999
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,796
All right...

1000
01:10:23,427 --> 01:10:24,928
No more lies.

1001
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:27,513
Where is he?

1002
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:30,099
- Go...
- Where is he?!

1003
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:33,186
Spit it out!

1004
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,066
Jane! D-don't!

1005
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:09,138
We are business folk.

1006
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,349
And I will not abide...

1007
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,812
...by anyone's purposeful

1008
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,981
undermining of our venture.

1009
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,568
So I'll start with the Chinaman.

1010
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,737
If I don't get satisfaction,

1011
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:28,074
we will work our way
through his family,

1012
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,618
one by one, until I do.

1013
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,745
Question is plain.

1014
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,749
Where's the Montana Kid?

1015
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:41,879
Kick it.

1016
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,424
Anyone touches that chair,

1017
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:47,135
and I'll put a bullet in your other ear!

1018
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,475
Calm down, there, ma'am.

1019
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,944
He's long gone. Days ago.

1020
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,698
Why don't you go back
from where you came?

1021
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,332
She's lyin'. Kick the chair.

1022
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,418
Don't!

1023
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,508
I count four, Ben.

1024
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,183
You want gunplay?!

1025
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,355
Is that what you want?!

1026
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,691
I will bleed this town
till I find him!

1027
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:17,850
Oh no.

1028
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:19,477
Ben!

1029
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,153
No more.

1030
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,197
It ends here.

1031
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:35,910
Doc, Jane, everybody -
put your guns down.

1032
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,704
We can do this!

1033
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,498
There'll be no more killin'.

1034
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,210
Not one shot.

1035
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,506
I'm going with you.

1036
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,385
- We-we can't let you do that, Sean.
- Yes, you can.

1037
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,889
I've run long enough.

1038
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:59,725
I've seen enough blood spilled
on my account.

1039
01:13:59,893 --> 01:14:03,104
You tell your boys, Ben, we're done.

1040
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,313
Done shootin'.

1041
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:08,109
I'm comin' with you.
- Is a trick.

1042
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:19,370
Get the leg irons.

1043
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,919
Doc?

1044
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:29,255
Well, Jane, he... he wants to go, eh?

1045
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,635
- Okay, then. On the count of three,
everyone lowers their weapons.

1046
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,971
One...

1047
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,103
...two...

1048
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,076
...three.

1049
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,913
Whoa!

1050
01:15:02,956 --> 01:15:04,582
Whoa! Cease fire!

1051
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop!

1052
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,504
Cease fire, I said!

1053
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,714
Cease fire!

1054
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:13,841
Hold it! Cease fire!

1055
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:17,595
Three! I said three!

1056
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,521
No, no, no!

1057
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,648
Down, down!

1058
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,665
Go around! Get behind him!

1059
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,335
Rats. Sean!

1060
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,052
Sorry!

1061
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,430
Here he comes!

1062
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:11,482
Oh! Damn!

1063
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,445
Grandpa!

1064
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,367
Sean!!!

1065
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,407
Stay back.

1066
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:06,537
Just... hold it!

1067
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:12,710
I have gone to considerable effort here
to head off any killin' today.

1068
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,589
Ben, we been doin' this for too long.
Ten years - too long.

1069
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,633
Me chasin' you, you chasin' me,

1070
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,509
and, well, me...

1071
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:24,722
...shootin' that ear of yours
almost clean off your head.

1072
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,808
- I'm disfigured!
- Yeah, I... I know. I'm sorry.

1073
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,894
But, you know, whas done is done.
Enough's enough.

1074
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:32,563
Except if you kill her,

1075
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,774
you know damn well
I'll shoot you dead.

1076
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:38,361
And I... I really don't want it
to come to that.

1077
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:42,156
Uh... you know, I'm...

1078
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,784
trying to... to change,

1079
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:47,912
to not be doing these...
the things that I used to do

1080
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,998
the way I did them
and to try and...

1081
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,834
change into becomin' that person
that I'm gonna...

1082
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,378
What?!

1083
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,715
Forget it.

1084
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,180
Is complicated.

1085
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,644
And you...

1086
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:17,650
You pull that trigger,
and you'll pray you never did.

1087
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:20,569
Killin' a man's
not something you can undo.

1088
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:22,113
Ill eat at you.

1089
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,324
Till you hate everything about
that one moment in time.

1090
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,536
Including me.

1091
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:31,706
I couldn't live with that.

1092
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,875
So please...

1093
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:59,150
- You ain't worth the bullet.
- Oh, ho-ho.

1094
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:02,403
She is most definitely worth a bullet.
- Hey!

1095
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,406
- No, I didn't mean that way...
- You, on the other hand,

1096
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,450
are worth 4,000 dead or alive!

1097
01:19:07,617 --> 01:19:10,619
This time I think it prudent...

1098
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,289
...to go dead.

1099
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,542
Oh! Christmas crackers!

1100
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,378
You supposin' we're square now?!

1101
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,132
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon so.

1102
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,009
Good.

1103
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,345
Now you can finish patchin' up
my whatchamacallit.

1104
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:30,473
- Gluteus.
- Damn right. Come on.

1105
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,776
Huh?

1106
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:44,987
Ah, the gunfight?

1107
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,406
You had the gunfight!

1108
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,074
Ah, no! Would you?

1109
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:51,577
I missed it! I missed it!

1110
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,621
Son of a!

1111
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,794
- Each of you
has a writ of expatriation

1112
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,462
and a notice of intent

1113
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,923
to charge and detain.

1114
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:06,175
Writ of what?

1115
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:09,553
- It means I will graciously escort
your smelly hides out of the country,

1116
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:13,265
and if you even think of returning,
will show you one of Her Majesty's...

1117
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:14,683
hoosegows!

1118
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:16,435
Whas a hoosegow?

1119
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,564
Shut up.

1120
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:26,237
- Hoosegow.
What the hell's a hoosegow?

1121
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:27,404
Ahem.

1122
01:20:27,572 --> 01:20:29,532
Ahem-hem-hem! Mm.

1123
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,010
Thank you.

1124
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:32,011
- I guess this is the part where
you become a charming memory.

1125
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:33,554
Not quite. Uh...

1126
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,473
turns out there's a fair bit of debt
that has to be satisfied

1127
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:40,477
before I can leave this, uh...
this town.

1128
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:47,818
I owe for...

1129
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:49,570
nine bullets, one teacup,

1130
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,030
one shear pin,

1131
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:52,573
one case of snails,

1132
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,575
one carrot,

1133
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,493
laundry and sewing services...

1134
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:01,582
...four horseshoes,
one portrait of a ugly lady,

1135
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,542
one bag of cats...

1136
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,169
Wait a minute.

1137
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:06,879
Oh, thas oats.

1138
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:09,590
One gluteus bullet extraction -

1139
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,801
mine was gratis,
but not Jack's, apparently -

1140
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:15,262
and, uh... the repair

1141
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,432
of roughly 100 bullet holes.

1142
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,809
- It could take some time.
- Mm-hmm.

1143
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:24,229
Frankly, I don't see
how I got saddled with the cost

1144
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,565
of the shear pin.
Is your windmill.

1145
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,011
Yeah!

1146
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,062
Do I still get your horse?

1147
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:07,648
What is wrong with you people?

1148
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,653
Don't let the darkness

1149
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,239
In your head

1150
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:26,959
All the love you meant to share

1151
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,128
You shared

1152
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:39,972
All the tears we'll never hear

1153
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:47,896
And all the dreams that disappear

1154
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,610
Sometimes you feel so alone

1155
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,155
In the shadows of regret...

1156
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,619
Hey!

1157
01:24:02,787 --> 01:24:03,996
Click! Click!

1158
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,999
Come here to me, horse.

1159
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,334
Fuck you, horse.
...In your head

1160
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:11,462
A Peacemaker.

1161
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,213
An Equalizer.

1162
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:15,841
A Widowmaker.
- Stop that.

1163
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,886
- A Peacemaker...
Yeah, an Equalizer.

1164
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,513
The... the... the... the, uh...

1165
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:23,098
the Womanizer.

1166
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:31,899
- Yesterday, I lost my hat,
so this is no fuckin' good.

1167
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:33,484
What the hell?!

1168
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:36,236
Another fucking dust storm!

1169
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,323
- I'd like to kill you,
but I cannot see you!

1170
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:42,701
- And they each earned their bullet
of their own accord.

1171
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,998
I said that weird,
like with almost a Martian accent.

1172
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:52,795
- That would be a fragrant contravention
of rule 44 of the constables' code

1173
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:55,130
of behaviour, hygiene
and equipment care.

1174
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,091
"Fragrant" contravention?

1175
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,843
- You want the damn showdown,
or not?

1176
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,680
Hmm.

1177
01:25:04,682 --> 01:25:06,266
What were all those other lines?

1178
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,310
- You could strangle someone
with a rope.

1179
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,437
Yah. Or pull them to the desert.

1180
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:13,232
Mm. Tie 'em to a bed.

1181
01:25:13,399 --> 01:25:15,025
Fuck!

1182
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:29,456
...All the pain
thas messin' up your mind

1183
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,461
Makes you feel like

1184
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:37,047
Leavin' you behind

1185
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:42,052
Sometimes you feel so alone...

1186
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:44,263
Fucking fuck.

1187
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:47,933
I heard that, Paul.

1188
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,893
This is my path.

1189
01:25:50,061 --> 01:25:52,396
This is what I do.

1190
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,984
And thas his path.
Thas what he does.

1191
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,735
What he eats, he shits.

1192
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,238
He's a horse.

1193
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:03,866
I am a man.
I have a gun.

1194
01:26:04,033 --> 01:26:06,243
I do different things.
I kill people.

1195
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,912
I shit, too,
but I don't do it the same way.

1196
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:12,040
I don't even lift anything, I just...
have a bowl I sit on.

1197
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,543
Sometimes just out in the field
is where I'll shit.

1198
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:16,086
You lost your carrot?

1199
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,465
You lost your rabbit?

1200
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:37,816
...Don't let the darkness

1201
01:26:37,984 --> 01:26:40,360
In your head

1202
01:26:47,744 --> 01:27:02,758
Ooh...

1203
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:17,648
Don't let the darkness

1204
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:20,359
In your head

1205
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:32,037
All the songs you meant to sing

1206
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:33,789
You did

1207
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,841
Don't let the darkness

1208
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:47,386
In your head

1209
01:27:56,229 --> 01:28:00,274
All the love you meant to share

1210
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,401
You shared

1211
01:28:49,866 --> 01:28:52,784
