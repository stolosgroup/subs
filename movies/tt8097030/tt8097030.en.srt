<i>The number one rule
in my family?</i>

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,927
<i>Honor your parents.</i>

5
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,598
<i>They're the supreme beings
who gave you life</i>

6
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,059
<i>who sweated
and sacrificed so much</i>

7
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>to put a roof
over your head,</i>

8
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>food on your plate,</i>

9
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,190
<i>an epic amount of food.</i>

10
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>The least you can do
in return is</i>

11
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,111
<i>every single thing
they ask.</i>

12
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:14,032
<i>'Course some people are like,
"Be careful.</i>

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,367
<i>"Honoring your parents
sounds great,</i>

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,536
<i>"but if you take it too far,</i>

15
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>"well, you might forget
to honor yourself."</i>

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,127
Luckily,
I don't have that problem.

17
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,756
I'm Meilin Lee.

18
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,134
And ever since I turned 13,
I've been doing my own thing.

19
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,930
Making my own moves,
24/7, 365.

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,599
I wear what I want,
say what I want

21
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,267
and I will not
hesitate to do

22
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,229
a spontaneous cartwheel
if I feel so moved.

23
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,855
Oh, crap!

24
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,317
Not to brag,

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,153
but being 13 means
I'm officially a grown-up.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,614
At least according to the
Toronto Transit Commission.

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,782
Good for you.

28
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,120
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

29
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,996
All about that hustle,
am I right?

30
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,765
Besties, assemble!

31
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,350
- Miriam!
- Hmm?

32
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,144
Hey!

33
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,146
Priya!

34
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,274
Yo.

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,276
Abby!

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,737
Yeah. What's up, Mei?

37
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,408
Ready to change the world?

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,576
So ready.

39
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,869
I was born to do this.

40
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,787
Let's burn this place
to the ground!

41
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,581
Y equals negative four.

42
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,209
Manitoba,
Alberta, and Saskatchewan.

43
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,254
<i>I know, it's a lot...</i>

44
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,883
But this is grade eight.

45
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,301
I don't got time
to mess around.

46
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,803
I guess you could call me...

47
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:03,933
A very enterprising,
mildly annoying young lady.

48
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,643
A major weirdo.

49
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,021
An overachieving dork-narc.

50
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,482
I accept
and embrace all labels.

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,071
- Oops.
- Hey!

52
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,156
- Aah!
- Oh, you're dead!

53
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,532
Coming through!

54
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,409
Move, please!

55
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,036
Share the sidewalk, people!

56
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,413
Anyway, who cares what stupid,

57
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,165
evil Tyler
or anyone else thinks?

58
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,541
This is gonna be my year.

59
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,834
Mei, Mei, Mei,
come see this!

60
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,337
And nothing's gonna stop
this train from...

61
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,671
Shh. Come on, come on!

62
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,964
- Get your butt over here!
- Go, go, go.

63
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,383
Come on, come on.
Mei, Mei, fast!

64
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,593
- Shut up!
- Shh!

65
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,056
- Huh?
- Mmm-hmm!

66
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,766
- Uh...
- Mmm.

67
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,892
Devon.

68
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,024
My mom cuts his hair
at the salon,

69
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,859
and I felt it. It's very soft.

70
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,444
Whoa. Can I have some?

71
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,029
Yeah, Abby, hook a sister up.

72
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,197
Ugh!

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,782
He looks like a hobo.

74
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,116
A hot hobo.

75
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,203
May I remind you
what real men look like?

76
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,038
4-Town!

77
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,873
Yes! 4-Town!

78
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>Jesse went to art school.</i>

79
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,672
<i>Tae Young fosters</i>

80
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,006

<i>Robaire speaks French.</i>

82
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:21,886
Hey!

83
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,638
<i>And Aaron T. and Aaron Z.</i>

84
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,056
<i>are, like,
really talented, too.</i>

85
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:30,144
- We are 4-Townies, remember?
- Ride or die!

86
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,152
Yeah, but tickets
to 4-Town are, like,

87
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,238
a bajillion dollars,
and Devon's right here.

88
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,406
And free!

89
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,659
Ah, fudgesicles! I gotta go.

90
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,953
Wait! We're going
karaokeing today.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,121
- Yeah!
- Come with us.

92
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,498
Please.

93
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,292
- Please.
- I...

94
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,836
can't. It's cleaning day.

95
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,839
Mei, every day
is cleaning day.

96
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,424
Can't you just
get one afternoon off?

97
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,801
But I like cleaning.

98
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,177
Plus,
I got this new feather duster

99
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,304
and, oh, my gosh, you guys,

100
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,431
it picks up so much dirt,
it's bananas!

101
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,224
Fine. I'll let you go.

102
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,853
If you can pass the gauntlet.

103
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,772
- Come on. Uh! Oh.
- Mir, not now...

104
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,274
You can't resist it.

105
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,400
Come on.

106
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,860
You know you want to.

107
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,862
Here we go.

108
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,905
<i>You're never not on my mind</i>

109

<i>I'm never not by your side,
your side</i>

111
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,411
Yeah.

112
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>Your side</i>

113
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,913

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,415
Yeah! Go, Mei!

115
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,292
- See, that was good!
- That was dope!

116
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,460
You passed.

117
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,462
And here is your reward.

118
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,629
Ninety-nine Australian tour,

119

with the <i>Girl I Love</i>
<i>Your Jeans</i> remix.

O-M-G, Mir!
I'll guard it with my life!

Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

4-Town 4-ever!

123
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,475
4-ever!

124
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,062
We'll karaoke another time,
I promise!

125
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,229
Okay, sure, Mei!

126
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,815
It'll be on me.
The snacks, the tunes...

127
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,817
- Whoo!
- You're my jam, girl.

128
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,618
She's so brainwashed.

129
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,705
Crud, crud, crud.

130
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>Okay.</i>

131
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,667
Excuse me.

132

<i>I know what it looks like.</i>

133
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,755
<i>I am my own person.</i>

134
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,674
<i>But that doesn't mean
doing whatever I want.</i>

135
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,093
- Hello, Meilin.
- Hey, how's it going?

136
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,761
Thank you, Meilin!

137
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,599
<i>Like most adults,
I have responsibilities.</i>

138
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,643
Hey, Bart. Hey, Lisa.

139
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,814
- Hello, Meilin.
- 'Sup?

140
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,233
Still down for a rematch,
Mr. Gao?

141
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,401
Bring it, Lee!

142
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,821
What a good girl.

143
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,572
<i>It's not all about me,
you know?</i>

144
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,496
<i>I do make my own moves,
it's just that...</i>

145
00:06:55,706 --> 00:07:00,128
<i>...some of my moves
are also hers.</i>

146
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,838
Mei-Mei, there you are.

147
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,297
- Hey, Mom...
- You're ten minutes late.

148
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,133
What happened? Are you hurt?
Are you hungry?

149
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,426
Um...

150
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,593
How was school today?

151
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,555
Killed it per usual.
Check it out.

152
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,015
Oh. That's my little scholar.

153
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,308
Today, honor student,

154
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,769
tomorrow,
UN Secretary General.

155
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,439
The ancestors
would be so proud.

156
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:35,997
Sun Yee, revered ancestor,
guardian of the red pandas.

157
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:39,542
We humbly thank you
for protecting and guiding us.

158
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,335
Especially Mei-Mei.

159
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,256
May we continue
to serve and honor you

160
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,757
and this community.

161
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,468
Always.

162
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,280
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

163
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,418
Have fun

164
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,794
getting that off.

165
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,879
Shoo-shoo! You vandals!

166
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,005
Oh, snap!
They're coming!

167
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,673
- You good-for-nothing hosers!
- Go, go, go!

168
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,467
I'm telling your mothers!

169
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,595
Our family runs
one of the oldest temples

170
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,514
in Toronto.
And the most unique.

171
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,934
Instead of honoring a god,
we honor our ancestors.

172
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,727
And not just the dudes either.

173
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,897
Our most revered ancestor,
Sun Yee,

174
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,942
was a scholar, poet,
and defender of animals.

175
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,111
She dedicated her life to
the creatures of the forest.

176
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,280
Especially the red panda.

177
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,448
- Ta-da!
- Ooh!

178
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,325
Which she loved
for its fiery coat

179
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,952
and mischievous nature.

180
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,247
Ever since, the red panda
has blessed our family

181
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,249
with good fortune
and prosperity...

182
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:04,085
And it can bless yours, too!

183
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,924
- Bye-bye!
- See you next time!

184
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,300
Thanks for coming.

185
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,765
- Give me five.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,934
- Come on. Dad's making dinner.
- Ooh.

187
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,874
Mmm.

188
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,086
Huh? Uh...

189
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,721
He should have listened

190
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,014
to his mother
and married Ling-Yi.

191
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,600
Totally.
Siu-Jyu is so two-faced.

192
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,977
She's just using him
to get to the throne.

193
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,937
She'll probably stab him
on their wedding night.

194
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,105
Mmm-hmm.

195
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,149
Hmm?

196
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,026
Mmm. Hmm!

197
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,235
- Perfect.
- Yes!

198
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,403
<i>You've heard their hits,</i>

199
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,571
<i>you've seen their moves.</i>

200
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,823
<i>And now, you get
to experience them live!</i>

201
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,867
<i>The worldwide
pop sensation 4-Town</i>

202
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,077
<i>will be kicking off
their North American tour!</i>

203
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,704
<i>Tickets on sale now.</i>

204
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,247
Oh, my gosh!

205
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,458
Who are these hip-hoppers?

206
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,126
And why are they called
"4-Town"

207
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,419
if there are five of them?

208
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,296
Uh... I don't know.

209
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,131
Some of the kids
at school like them.

210
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,926
You mean Miriam?
That girl is odd.

211
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,679
Dinner's ready.

212
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,645
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

213
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,272
<i>You're never not on my mind</i>

214
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,441
<i>Oh my, oh my</i>

215
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:54,737
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

216
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,367
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

217
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,371
<i>I'm gonna be your ride or die
All right</i>

218
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,631
Hmm. Kinda looks like Devon.

219
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,510
I don't get
what Mir sees in him.

220
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,095
He's not that cute.

221
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:24,433
Okay, his shoulder's, like,
kind of nice, I guess.

222
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:28,771
His eyes are... fine.

223
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,481
Mei-Mei.

224
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,899
Ow! Ah!

225
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,447
Do you want a snack?

226
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,906
Cool, great, thanks.

227
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,158
<i>Don't look at the notebook,</i>

228
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,367
<i>don't look
at the notebook, don't!</i>

229
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,120
<i>No!</i>

230
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,040
Oh.

231
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,459
- Is this your homework?
- Mom...

232
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,461
- Don't!
- Oh, my. What... What is...

233
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,837
- Do not.
- Huh? What?

234
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,797
- Mom.
- Oh! Oh.

235
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,008
Huh? Huh?

236
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,176
Mei-Mei, what is this?

237
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,927
It's nothing. Just a boy.
He's no one.

238
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,304
A boy?

239
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,055
Who is he?
Did he do these things to you?

240
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,725
No! It's just made up, Mom!

241
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,227
It's not real.

242
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,313
That hat.

243
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,399
Is that the sketchy clerk
from the Daisy Mart?

244
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,525
Mom, no!

245
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,154
What are you doing?

246
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,949
No, no, no!

247
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,243
No, no, no!

248
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,245
Oh, snap!

249
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,915
Mom, no!

250
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,374
- You!
- Whoa!

251
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,751
What have you done
to my Mei-Mei?

252
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,169
Uh... Who?

253
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,962
Meilin Lee, right here.

254
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,007
I should report you
to the police.

255
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,717
How old are you? Thirty?

256
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,093
I'm seventeen.

257
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,512
Oh, see, see?

258
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,138
This is what happens
when you don't wear sunblock

259
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,515
and do drugs all day!

260
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,600
She's just a sweet,
innocent child.

261
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,727
How dare you
take advantage of her!

262
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,730
Mom! No!

263
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,360
What?

264
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,154
What a weirdo.

265
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,657
Look at her.

266
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,999
The Daisy Mart has lost
a loyal customer today.

267
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,675
Thank goodness I was here.

268
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,135
That degenerate
won't come near you again.

269
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:10,558
Now, is there anything else
I should know about, Mei-Mei?

270
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,686
Nope. All good.

271
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,114
You sicko!
What were you thinking?

272
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,907
Why would you
draw those things?

273
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,410
Those horrible, awful,
sexy things?

274
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,620
It's fine.
You'll move to another city,

275
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,746
change your identity.

276
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:38,544
Mommy, I'm so sorry.

277
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,299
You are her pride and joy,
so act like it!

278
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,602
This will never happen again.

279
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,669
No! No, no, no!

280
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,680
Mei-Mei...

281
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,974
are you up?

282
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,228
Breakfast is ready!

283
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,980
- Mmm.
- Hey! No sugar.

284
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,401
Coming!

285
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,572
Mmm. Porridge.

286
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,463
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

287
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,890
- Wake up, wake up, wake up!
- Mei-Mei,

288
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,017
is everything okay?

289
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,601
Don't come in here!

290
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,271
Mei-Mei, what's going on,
honey? Are you sick?

291
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,815
Is it a fever? A stomach ache?
Chills? Constipation?

292
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:05,983
No!

293
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,110
Wait. Is it...

294
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,821
that? Did the...

295
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,157
Did the red peony bloom?

296
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,324
No!

297
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,452
Maybe?

298
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,786
But it's too soon.

299
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,248
Don't worry, Mei-Mei.
I'll get everything you need.

300
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,624
Mommy's here.

301
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,836
Jin. Jin! It's happening!

302
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
Come on! Please!

303
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,509
- Mei-Mei, I'm coming.
- Crud.

304
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,844
- I'm coming.
- No!

305
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,971
It's going to be okay.

306
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,057
No, it's not!
Will you just get out?

307
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,934
Excuse me?

308
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,355
I didn't mean that.
I'm a gross red monster!

309
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,275
Stop it! Stop talking!

310
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,572
Mei-Mei,
I know this is upsetting,

311
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,200
but we are going
to get through this together.

312
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,788
I have ibuprofen, vitamin B,
a hot water bottle, and pads.

313
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,123
Regular, overnight, scented,
unscented, thin, ultrathin...

314
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,333
- Uh-huh. All right.
- ...ultrathin with wings...

315
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,126
Awesome.
Just leave them by the sink.

316
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,170
Mei-Mei.
Perhaps we should talk

317
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,505
about why this is happening.

318
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,716
No! I mean, nah, it's okay.

319
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,636
You are a woman now.

320
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,012
And your body

321
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,597
- is starting to change.
- Mmm-hmm.

322
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,099
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

323
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,266
Mom, please!

324
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,394
You are now a beautiful,
strong flower.

325
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,896
No, no, no.

326
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,564
Who must protect
your delicate petals

327
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,441
and clean them regularly.

328
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,194
- Ming? Ming!
- My porridge.

329
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,987
Jin. Jin!

330
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,280
Jin, open a window!

331
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,365
Somebody call emergency!

332
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,913
I'll just go to sleep,
and when I wake up...

333
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,289
this will all be over.

334
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,927
What the...

335
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,434
Whoa.

336
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,779
Yes!

337
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,448
No!

338
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,535
Oh.

339
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,456
I'm calm.

340
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,084
Zen.

341
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,505
Yes.

342
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,472
Okay. No biggie.

343
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,100
You'll figure this out, Lee.

344
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,060
Just be the calm,

345
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,605
mature adult

346
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,565
you totally are.

347
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,859
You got this.

348
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,539
I know it feels strange,
Mei-Mei,

349
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,334
but I promise,
nobody will notice a thing.

350
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,462
Thank you
for your concern, Mother.

351
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,796
But I'll be fine.

352
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,258
Well, here's your lunch.
I packed extra snacks.

353
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:21,386
And herbal tea. For cramps.
It helps relax your...

354
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,679
I got it. Thank you. Bye.

355
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,202
Let's go, Beavers!
Let's go!

356
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,041
Hey, Mei.

357
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:54,169
Hey, girlfriends.
What is up?

358
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,964
Uh, what's with the tuque?

359
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,258
Uh... Bad hair day.

360
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,759
Did you, like,
work out this morning?

361
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,094
I got you, girl.

362
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,263
- Mei, we gotta talk.
- Okay.

363
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,472
Tyler's been telling everyone

364
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,848
- about the Daisy Mart.
- What?

365
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,225
He said
your mom went nuts.

366
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,351
And that you're
kind of a perv.

367
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,852
I am not a...

368
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,148
Tyler is an insecure jerkwad.

369
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,525
Words were exchanged.

370
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,111
Slightly uncomfortable secrets
were revealed.

371
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,490
End of story...

372
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,252
Uh, Mei?

373
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,004
Why are you staring
at Carter Murphy-Mayhew?

374
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,505
I wasn't.

375
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,924
No!

376
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,218
Tyler keeps putting these up.

377
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,594
Knock it off, butthead.

378
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:45,887
Not funny, Tyler!

379
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,724
Devon, my precious manly man.

380
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,850
I banish you.

381
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,435
- Literally go away!
- Begone!

382
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,811
I'm gonna kill him!

383
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,021
What is wrong with you?

384
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,188
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
You wanna do this?

385
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,356
Leave her alone!

386
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,691
You want
a piece of me, huh? Come here!

387
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,900
Smell you later, dorks.

388
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,777
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Get out of here, dude.

389
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,237
Gotta go.

390
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,655
- Uh, see you at lunch.
- Mei?

391
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,791
What's with her?

392
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,293
What's with your face?

393
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,545
What is with you?
You're being weird.

394
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,298
I'm just really excited
about math.

395
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,883
All right, guys.

396
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,760
The quadratic formula.

397
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,637
Let the fun begin.

398
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,849
Who can tell me
how the formula begins?

399
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,018
X equals...

400
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,522
What a surprise, no one.
Okay, listen up.

401
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,734
X equals negative B,
plus or minus,

402
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,403
don't forget that plus
or minus, or I promise you,

403
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,822
you will live to regret it.

404
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,873
No. No. No.

405
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,292
- Hi. Uh, ma'am?
- This isn't happening.

406
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,087
- Hi!
- My child goes to this school.

407
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,172
Why don't you come
to the front office?

408
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,382
- I'm sure that someone can...
- Keep your...

409
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,549
Ow!

410
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,717
I pay my taxes.

411
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,094
Whoa, what is that?

412
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,262
All right, all right,

413
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,056
settle down, little goblins.

414
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,474
- Stop it!
- Whoa!

415
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,892
Mei-Mei!

416
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,311
- No. Please, no.
- Mei-Mei, help!

417
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,397
Mei-Mei, tell him it's me!

418
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:20,982
Mei-Mei!

419
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,442
I will report you
for trespassing.

420
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,693
Tell him it's Mommy!

421
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,989
Mei-Mei!
Tell him you forgot your pads!

422
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,217
Mei-Mei.

423
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,428
Come back!

424
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,444
O-M-G!

425
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,408
Hey, I gotta go!
Open up!

426
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,875
Mei-Mei! Stop!

427
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,921
Jin. Jin, get home now.
There's been an emergency.

428
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,131
<i>Is it the woman thing?</i>

429
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,382
No! Another one.

430
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,135
It's so good.

431
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,261
Run!

432
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,888
It's a monster!

433
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,987
Awooga!

434
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,071
Huh?

435
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,131
Uh-oh.

436
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,396
Mei-Mei.

437
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,608
Mei-Mei.

438
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,152
Gotta get home! Gotta hide!

439
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,034
Mei-Mei.

440
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,063
Mei-Mei.

441
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,651
Mei-Mei!

442
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,822
Oh!

443
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,740
Mei-Mei!

444
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,245
Mei-Mei?

445
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,457
Don't look at me! Stay back!

446
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,795
Sweetie,
it's okay. Mommy is here.

447
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,547
What's happening to me?

448
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,258
What is it? What... What...

449
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,302
It's happened already?

450
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,642
What did you say?

451
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,523
Ming?

452
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,609
It's time.

453
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,050
As you know,
our ancestor, Sun Yee,

454
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,053
had a mystical connection
with red pandas.

455
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:22,265
In fact,
she loved them so much

456
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:25,560
that she asked the gods
to turn her into one.

457
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,816
<i>It was wartime.
The men were all gone.</i>

458
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,278
<i>Sun Yee
was desperate for a way</i>

459
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,530
<i>to protect herself
and her daughters.</i>

460
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,575
<i>Then one night,
during a red moon,</i>

461
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,911
<i>the gods granted her wish.</i>

462
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,331
<i>They gave her the ability
to harness her emotions</i>

463
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,126
<i>to transform into a powerful,
mystical beast.</i>

464
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,338
<i>She was able
to fend off bandits,</i>

465
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,547
<i>protect her village,</i>

466
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,841
<i>and save her family from ruin.</i>

467
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,178
<i>Sun Yee passed this gift
to her daughters,</i>

468
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,055
<i>for when they came of age.</i>

469
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,265
And they passed it to theirs.

470
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,558
But over time,

471
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,395
our family chose
to come to a new world.

472
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,272
And what was a blessing
became...

473
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,024
an inconvenience.

474
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,406
Are you serious?

475
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,491
- No!
- Mei-Mei, no!

476
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,076
- It's a curse!
- She meant it as a blessing.

477
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,078
You cursed us!
It's all your fault!

478
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,956
Mei-Mei, stop!
Listen to me. Listen!

479
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,541
There's a cure!

480
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,213
Really? How do you know?

481
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,049
Because it happened to me.

482
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,177
Why didn't you warn me?

483
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,346
I thought I had more time!

484
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,681
You're just a child.

485
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,516
I thought, if I watched you
like a hawk,

486
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,477
I'd see the signs
and be able to prepare.

487
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,772
But it's going to be fine.
I overcame it

488
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,649
and you will too.

489
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,901
On the next red moon,

490
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,611
you'll undergo a ritual

491
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,572
that will seal
your red panda spirit

492
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,407
into one of these.

493
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,160
And then
you'll be cured for good.

494
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,203
Just like me.

495
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,374
But any strong emotion
will release the panda.

496
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,293
And the more you release it,

497
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,504
the more difficult
the ritual will be.

498
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:20,759
There is a darkness
to the panda, Mei-Mei.

499
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,012
You only have
one chance to banish it,

500
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,055
and you cannot fail.

501
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,309
Otherwise,
you'll never be free.

502
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,938
Let's see, the next red moon
will be the 25th.

503
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,815
That's a whole month away.

504
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,442
We'll wait it out together.

505
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,571
And I'll be with you
every step of the way.

506
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,290
Not bad.

507
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,003
I saved Wilfred.

508
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,505
Thanks, Dad.

509
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,676
It's only temporary, Mei-Mei.

510
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:08,223
This way, we won't worry about
any more accidents. Hmm?

511
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,854
Sleep tight.

512
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,945
Red is a lucky color.

513
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,796
<i>This is awful.</i>

514
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,131
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

515
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,592
<i>Don't worry.
We'll get through this.</i>

516
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,595
<i>No one
can see her like this.</i>

517
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,056
<i>I never wanted this for her.</i>

518
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,685
<i>Did you see
how she was in the temple?</i>

519
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,020
<i>Her eyes...</i>

520
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,975
Please...

521
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,853
just...

522
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,106
go away.

523
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,777
No!

524
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,447
Why? Why?

525
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,615
Mei, it's us.

526
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,782
- Open up.
- Crud, no.

527
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,910
Guys, what are you doing?
Go away!

528
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,828
Are you okay?
Tap if you can hear us.

529
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,288
One for yes, two for no!

530
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,456
We were so worried.

531
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,499
We thought
you died of embarrassment.

532
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,376
You need more pads?
I brought extra.

533
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,546
Forget that.
4-Town's coming to Toronto!

534
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,632
What?

535
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,091
Hey!

536
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,343
It's okay, everybody be quiet!

537
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,427
Everybody, it's just me!
Shut up!

538
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,678
It's okay, it's me!

539
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,889
It's Mei!
Calm down, all right?

540
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,016
I'm gonna let go
and you're gonna be chill.

541
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,100
Got that?

542
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,769
Mmm-hmm.

543
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,937
Chill.

544
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,356
Mei?

545
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,983
Are you a werewolf?

546
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,151
No! What?

547
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,362
- She is a red panda!
- Sick.

548
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,948
You're so fluffy!
You're so fluffy!

549
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,784
- I've always wanted a tail.
- Priya, Abby, quit it.

550
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,577
Mei, what the heck happened?

551
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:39,457
It's just some, you know,
inconvenient, uh,

552
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,585
genetic thingy
I got from my mom.

553
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,880
I mean...
It'll go away.

554
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,507
Eventually.

555
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,133
Maybe.

556
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,805
Aw, Mei.

557
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,850
I hate this!
I'm slobby, I'm smelly.

558
00:32:58,017 --> 00:33:00,103
My mom won't even look at me,

559
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,980
and now 4-Town?

560
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,898
When are they coming?

561
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,858
May 18th.
They just announced it.

562
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,276
The 18th?

563
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,279
There's no way
this will be gone by then.

564
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:14,450
Just go.
Go become women without me.

565
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,412
Mei. It's gonna be okay.

566
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,207
No, it's not. I'm a freak.

567
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,667
Just...

568
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,127
Just leave me alone.

569
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,977
Mmm. Yeah.

570
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,021
Mmm. Let's go.

571
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,605
Mmm.

572
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,815
Yeah. Mmm.

573
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,025
- Let's go.
<i>- I've never met</i>

574
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,695
<i>nobody like you</i>

575
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,865
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

576
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,199
<i>It's true</i>

577
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,077
<i>But they don't turn my tummy</i>

578
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,871
<i>The way you do</i>

579
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,790
<i>I've never met nobody</i>

580
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,167
<i>Like you</i>

581
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,131
<i>You're never not on my mind?</i>

582
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,467
<i>Oh, my, oh, my</i>

583
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,388
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

584
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:22,101
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

585
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,313
<i>I'll never not be your ride
or die</i>

586
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,564
<i>All right!</i>

587
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,066
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Go, Mei!

588
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,027
- Thanks, guys.
- You're the best.

589
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,488
- Aw, we love you, Mei.
- You're our girl.

590
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,908
Yeah. No matter what.
Panda or no panda.

591
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,455
Whoa.

592
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,790
- Mei!
- You're you!

593
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,666
And you look amazing!

594
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,460
Red looks so good on you.

595
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,628
Is it gone?

596
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,297
For now.
But if I get too excited,

597
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,840
it'll come right back... Ow!

598
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,550
Abby, what the heck?

599
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,427
Huh?

600
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,222
Something feels different.

601
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,475
Abby, hit me.

602
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,812
Ow.

603
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,979
Oh, my gosh!

604
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,481
I stayed calm.

605
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:12,527
Something about you guys,
like, neutralizes the panda.

606
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,487
Aw! It's our love.

607
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,947
We're like a warm
and fuzzy blanket.

608
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,031
Yeah.

609
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,867
This means
I can have my room back.

610
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,453
I can
have my life back!

611
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,914
No. Even better.

612
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,541
You can come with us
to 4-Town!

613
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:27,708
Yeah!

614
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,044
This could be our only chance
to see them together.

615
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,088
We're all asking
our parents tonight.

616
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,339
We're making our stand.

617
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:34,799
Yeah. You in or you out?

618
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:39,637
But I can't ask my mom.
I'm a furry ticking time bomb!

619
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,055
Of awesomeness!

620
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,015
And now you can control it!

621
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,769
So just prove it to her,
and she's gotta let you go!

622
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,021
Mei-Mei?

623
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,231
Crap! You guys better go.

624
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,440
- But...
- No "buts," Mir.

625
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,608
My mom
already doesn't like you.

626
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,860
Wait, she doesn't?

627
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,319
I'll call you, I promise.

628
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,238
- We love you, Mei.
- Hang in there, girl.

629
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,282
Everything okay?
I thought I heard...

630
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,326
Mom, I think
I've made a breakthrough.

631
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,585
Ready.

632
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,295
Deforestation.

633
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,506
Sad orangutan.

634
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:16,966
Mmm!

635
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,885
Your second place
spelling bee trophy.

636
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,891
The important thing
is you tried.

637
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,434
You spelled
your little butt off.

638
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,311
First place in our hearts.

639
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,818
What a shame.

640
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,554
So cute!

641
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,767
No. So fuzzy.

642
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,313
Must resist.

643
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,610
We love you, girl.

644
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,570
We love you, girl.

645
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,364
Panda or no panda.

646
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,748
How adorable.

647
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,251
Mei.

648
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,629
How is this possible?
What happened to your panda?

649
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,257
It's easy.
When I start to get emotional,

650
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,384
all I do is imagine the people

651
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,718
I love most
in the whole world.

652
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,886
Oh.

653
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,889
- Which is you guys.
- Oh.

654
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,849
Oh, Mei-Mei.

655
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,979
So, now that that's settled,

656
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:58,192
I just have one
teeny-tiny favor to ask.

657
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,403
No. Absolutely not.

658
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,239
What?

659
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,699
But this is
once in a lifetime.

660
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,618
Mei-Mei, it's one thing to
stay calm at home or school,

661
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,828
but a concert?

662
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,496
You'll get whipped up
into a frenzy

663
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,664
and panda all over the place.

664
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,250
I won't, I won't! I promise!

665
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,584
You saw me keep it in.

666
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,045
Ming, maybe
we should trust her.

667
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,672
It's them I don't trust.

668
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,340
Look at those
glittery delinquents

669
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,467
- with their...
- gyrations.

670
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,679
Why on earth
do you want to go so badly?

671
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,639
Chug! Chug! Chug!

672
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,603
Like I said,

673
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,398
I just want to broaden
my musical horizons.

674
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,900
This isn't music.
This is filth.

675
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,403
And it's not worth
jeopardizing your life over.

676
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,779
- Right, Jin?
- Uh...

677
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,991
See? Your father agrees.
No concert. And that's final.

678
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,081
Okay, well, thanks
for listening. Good night.

679
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,633
What was that?

680
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,303
Am I the only one
who sees the danger here?

681
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,513
There's no way
she could keep her panda in.

682
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,099
And $200? For what?

683
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,810
Who do they think they are?
Celine Dion?

684
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,606
Hmm. Unbelievable.
I saw that look.

685
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,982
Where did she get that from?

686
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,734
Treating her own mother
like that.

687
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,027
Hold on.
Ming, it's your mother.

688
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,195
I'm not here!

689
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,825
Mother. Hello.

690
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,577
<i>How's everything in Florida?</i>

691
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,789
Ming.
I know about Mei-Mei.

692
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,582
<i>I was just about
to call you,</i>

693
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,084
but everything's fine.

694
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,294
I'm gonna handle
the ritual on my own.

695
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,048
The way you "handled"
Mei-Mei being on the news?

696
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,217
No one knows anything.

697
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,760
<i>They barely saw her.</i>

698
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,930
I'm on my way.
With reinforcements.

699
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,890
No! I can handle it. I can...

700
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,103
Run!

701
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,896
Eyes on the balls, guys!

702
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,439
Be water! Be...

703
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,317
That presentation
was bomb-dot-com.

704
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:04,652
I cited all my sources.

705
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,155
I had sparklers.
And she still said no!

706
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,282
My parents said
I could go when I'm 30.

707
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,909
Mine called it stripper music.

708
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,536
What's wrong with that?

709
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,704
Mine said yes,
but I have to buy the ticket.

710
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,873
Who the heck's
got that kind of cash?

711
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,711
I know my mom's worried,
but sometimes she's just so...

712
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,172
- So...
- Wacko?

713
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,843
Ma'am! Please!

714
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,594
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lee!

715
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,138
I see you!

716
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,348
Little momma's girl.

717
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,018
No wonder Mei is such a loser.

718
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,575
Illegal throw!
You're out, Lee.

719
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,076
What? But, Mr. K, he...

720
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,370
Mei, chill.
Let's go, let's go.

721
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,913
Calm down, Mei.

722
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,499
Dude, keep it together.

723
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,502
I can't. We need
to see this concert.

724
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,630
Why doesn't my mom get that?
I never ask for anything.

725
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,507
My whole life
I've been her perfect

726
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,926
little Mei-Mei.
Temple duties, grades...

727
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,678
- Violin!
- Tap dancing.

728
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,139
Yeah. We've been so good.

729
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,600
If they don't trust us anyway,
then what's the point?

730
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,477
Wow! Who are you?

731
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,395
- I love it!
- Fight the power!

732
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,772
Yeah. Yeah.

733
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,067
This isn't just
our first concert.

734
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,404
This is our first step
into womanhood.

735
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,449
And we have to do it together.

736
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,869
I'm in, girl. We'll say
it's a sleepover at my house.

737
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,078
The perfect crime.

738
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,581
Yes! My mom will never know.

739
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,958
Now we just got to
raise the money for tickets.

740
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,668
Come on, girls, think!

741
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,507
Know what'll help me think?

742
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,966
- A little panda.
- Abby...

743
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,927
Come on, Mei.
It'll clear my mind.

744
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,429
Just a little hit!
It's so cute!

745
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:57,097
Ugh. Fine.

746
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,065
<i>Mon amour.</i>

747
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,361
Happy?

748
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,321
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff.

749
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,490
O-M-G.

750
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,534
Aah! Go away!

751
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,245
That was you in the bathroom!
I didn't imagine it!

752
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,580
- Yeah, you did.
- Get lost, Stacy.

753
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,874
But she's like a magical bear?

754
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,042
Red panda!

755
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,464
You are the cutest thing ever!

756
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,715
Come out, please?

757
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,967
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Please!

758
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,386
Wait. So, you like the panda?

759
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,137
Like it? I love it!

760
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,889
I'll give you anything! Money?

761
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,849
- My kidney!
- My soul.

762
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,268
- Yeah!
- Adorable!

763
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,644
You're so cute!

764
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,023
Is it on?

765
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,192
- Let's go!
- Yeah, panda!

766
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,611
<i>- Fuel for domination.
- Money, money, money!</i>

767
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,779
<i>Stop hogging
and give me some!</i>

768
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,863
<i>Pass that over.</i>

769
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,657
<i>4-Town, here we come!</i>

770
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,326
<i>Stop! That's so gross.
Do it again.</i>

771
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,828
<i>All right, troops, listen up.</i>

772
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,665
Operation 4-Town Shake Down
is about to commence.

773
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,960
The boys are coming
to the SkyDome May 18th.

774
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,380
Our goal, four tickets.
That's 800 bucks!

775
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,133
Step one,
neutralize the empress.

776
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,594
Mathletes?
Isn't it a little dangerous

777
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,178
to join an after-school
club now?

778
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,598
What's dangerous
is an academic record

779
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,683
with a lack
of extracurriculars.

780
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,351
Hmm... Huh.

781
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,104
Step two... Spread the word.

782
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,618
<i>And step three...</i>

783
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,412
<i>hustle this panda
and squeeze</i>

784
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:44,747
<i>every last loonie
outta those kids.</i>

785
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,753
<i>And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

786
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:56,508
<i>Did it on my own</i>

787
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,970
<i>Own</i>

788
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:04,266
<i>Did it on my own, yeah</i>

789
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,938
<i>You know what's up</i>

790
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,276
<i>You know it's us, yeah</i>

791
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,569
<i>You ready?</i>

792
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,446
<i>Here we go</i>

793
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,449
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

794
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,660
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

795
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,120
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

796
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,872
<i>Louder</i>

797
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,041
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

798
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,251
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

799
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,587
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

800
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,048
<i>Give me one, two, three, four</i>

801
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:40,469
<i>You wanted it, you went for it
And, baby, you got it</i>

802
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:45,182
<i>I wanted it, I went for it
And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

803
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:51,814
<i>Did it on my own</i>

804
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,652
<i>Own
Did it on my own</i>

805
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,738
- Let's go.
- Yeah!

806
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,830
<i>Did it on my...</i>

807
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,249
<i>- Oh, no, it's falling!
- Grab it!</i>

808
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,816
Yeah, dude, let's go!
Push it, dude! Come on!

809
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,568
Come on, new guy,
just keep on going!

810
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,407
Come on, guys, keep going.

811
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:56,086
Check out Number 12.
He's got delts for days.

812
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,131
Forget that. I need lunch.
I'm starting to black out!

813
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,175
I think I'm getting
carpal tunnel.

814
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,634
No pain, no gain, Priya.

815
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:04,052
Come on, chop-chop!
Five, 10...

816
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,387
Girl, relax.

817
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,930
Yeah. We're doing our best.

818
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,265
It's not enough!

819
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,600
The concert's this Saturday

820
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,143
and we're still
a hundred short!

821
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,811
I knew
we should have charged

822
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,313
more for photos!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

823
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,940
Mei, breathe. It's in the bag.

824
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,275
But...

825
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,152
What's the point
of getting to the concert

826
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,945
if you're too exhausted
to enjoy it?

827
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,282
Now, take a break and help me
appreciate some boys.

828
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,950
Okay, okay, okay.

829
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,745
Hey, what's up?

830
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,413
- Mei!
- Hey, Mei, what up?

831
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,874
- Looking good!
- Nice calves!

832
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,127
Are you a triangle?
'Cause you acute!

833
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,088
You guys are so weird.

834
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,424
- Hey!
- Are you spying on us?

835
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,759
I wanna talk to you, Lee.

836
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:44,885
- Forget it.
- Fine.

837
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,638
Wonder if your mom knows
her precious little Mei-Mei

838
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,681
has been flaunting the panda
all over school.

839
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,354
That's none of your business!

840
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,815
One more step and
I'm telling her everything.

841
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,401
Now, put that thing away
and hear me out.

842
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,279
What do you want?

843
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:09,535
I wanna throw a sick
birthday party. An epic one.

844
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,914
It's this Friday.

845
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,707
If you're there,
everyone will come.

846
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,209
Simple as that.

847
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,544
A party?

848
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,798
Look, I've done you a favor
keeping my mouth shut.

849
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,842
All I'm asking for
is one back.

850
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,886
Hmm.

851
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,764
I'll do it.

852
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,975
But it'll cost you one...

853
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,685
No. Two hundred bucks.

854
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,811
Okay.

855
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,021
Uh, hold, please.

856
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,149
Are you serious?
You can't trust him.

857
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,317
It's a trap!

858
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,069
This sounds like
a boy-girl party.

859
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,362
Are we allowed
to boy-girl parties?

860
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,782
Guys! Two hundred bucks
will put us over the top!

861
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,492
We have to do this.

862
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,619
We'll meet at Tyler's,
I'll do my thing,

863
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,496
and then we'll bounce.
Easy-peasy.

864
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,664
Dude, what about your mom?

865
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:56,790
Forget my mom.

866
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,667
I'll be back before
she even knows I'm gone.

867
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,210
- But...
- Hey, dorkbag.

868
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,130
We're in. But you only
get the panda for an hour.

869
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,008
And we are not
bringing any presents.

870
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,384
Deal.

871
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,395
Okay, I'm heading off
to mathletes. See you later!

872
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,899
Wait, what about dinner?
I made all your favorites.

873
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,862
Thanks,
but Miriam's dad is, uh,

874
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,655
ordering pizza.
Save me leftovers?

875
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,282
- What if I come with you?
- Wha...

876
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,492
What are you doing?
Linear equations? Geometry?

877
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,619
I have a double-jointed elbow!

878
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,245
Look! I can make
a perfect circle!

879
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:39,291
Wow! Yeah, but it'll be
super boring.

880
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,419
Wouldn't you
rather hang with Dad?

881
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,712
Oh.

882
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,672
Let's get my flashcards.

883
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,840
- But...
- Hmm.

884
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,258
I was mathletes champ

885
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,384
- in grade 8, you know?
- Uh-huh.

886
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,179
They called me
the "Uncommon Denominator."

887
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,473
Cool. Oh, uh,
<i>Jade Palace</i> is on tonight.

888
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,849
- Can't miss that, right?
- Now, who's the weak link?

889
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,975
Priya and Abby
seem bright enough, but...

890
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,143
Oh, and traffic's a nightmare.

891
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,227
I can just
take the streetcar...

892
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,395
- you stay and rest.
- Miriam...

893
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,855
I mean, she's a nice girl,

894
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,940
but maybe
she's slowing you down.

895
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,900
Oh, Mom, you really
don't have to come.

896
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,735
Don't be silly.
We're already on the way.

897
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,404
But I don't want you to!

898
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,996
Chop-chop, everyone.
Don't dawdle.

899
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,164
Hurry up.

900
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,263
Oh! What...

901
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,432
Hey, cuz! Surprise!

902
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,726
Aunties?
What are you doing here?

903
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,186
The ritual, silly.

904
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,355
- She's lost weight.
- No, no, she gained weight.

905
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,023
- She looks like her mother.
- She looks like her father.

906
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,191
Ladies.

907
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,072
Mother.

908
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,908
Hey, Grandma.

909
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,076
Poor dear.

910
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,995
It must be so difficult

911
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,081
keeping that
unruly beast at bay.

912
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,126
Your family is here now,
Mei-Mei.

913
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:07,004
And we will take care
of everything.

914
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,341
<i>Everybody clap your hands</i>

915
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,844
<i>Clap, clap, clap,
clap your hands</i>

916
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,723
<i>All right, now, we gonna do
the basic step...</i>

917
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,474
Where is she?

918
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,644
Who's up for some Boggle?

919
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,898
Eat. You need
your strength for the ritual.

920
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,567
Thank you, aunties.

921
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,861
Your hair is so thick,
like a pelt.

922
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,947
What a surprise
that you all came so early.

923
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,533
You need all the help
you can get, Ming.

924
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,327
So, Mei-Mei,
you've been managing

925
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,537
to keep the panda in?

926
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,457
- Yep. Totally.
- Really?

927
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,624
What's that, Lily?

928
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,085
Well, it's a little hard
to believe

929
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,671
that Mei-Mei
could control such a beast.

930
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,006
She's just a child.

931
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,216
It's true.
And if Mei-Mei's panda

932
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,594
is anything like Ming's...

933
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,845
Mei-Mei's better
than any of us

934
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,096
at controlling the panda.

935
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:02,017
She passed every trigger test.
Even the kitten box.

936
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,185
- Oh!
- Oh, my goodness!

937
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,311
- That's unbelievable.
- Impressive.

938
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,605
She just thinks
of my love for her,

939
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,940
and it gives her the strength
to stay calm.

940
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,109
Exactly.

941
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,778
- Aw.
- How sweet.

942
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,071
How sweet.

943
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,406
Anyway,
thanks for all the gifts,

944
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,450
but I think I'll go
to bed early.

945
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,951
Keeping that animal
locked down

946
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,536
sure takes a lot of energy.

947
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,246
Okay, sweetie. Get some rest.

948
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,331
Night, everyone.

949
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,457
- Good night, Mei-Mei.
- Sleep well.

950
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,583
- Get some beauty rest.
- Get some rest.

951
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,675
Oh!

952
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,599
Mei-Mei, can I have a word
with you?

953
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,018
Uh, sure. What's up?

954
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,189
I found this.

955
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:53,401
Strange for a girl
who hasn't let her panda out.

956
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,653
It's, uh...

957
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,363
It's not mine.

958
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,407
Mei-Mei,
I know what you're doing.

959
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:02,744
I know how hard it is
to keep the beast in.

960
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,414
It feels so good
to let it out. So free.

961
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,503
But each time you do,
the stronger it gets.

962
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:14,214
And then you'll be
bound to it forever,

963
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,716
and the ritual will fail.

964
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,845
Has that ever happened?

965
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,264
It cannot happen.

966
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,854
Your mother and I
were close once,

967
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,399
but the red panda
took that away.

968
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,486
I couldn't bear to see
that happen to you.

969
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,865
So, no more panda.

970
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,912
You are your mother's
whole world, Mei-Mei.

971
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,915
I know you'll do what's right.

972
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,670
Uh-uh. Mmm. Mmm!

973
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,463
- Uh, worm.
- Uh... Octopus!

974
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,549
- Spaghetti?
- Killer robot!

975
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,925
Mortality.

976
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,427
Hmm. Nice.

977
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,970
This sucks.

978
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,930
- Let's bail.
- Just wait. She'll be here.

979
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,390
I knew she'd flake.

980
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,474
Panda girl!

981
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,476
- It's Mei!
- Thank Cthulhu.

982
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,437
Ugh. About time.

983
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:17,068
Yo! What up, peeps?

984
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,278
What are you wearing?

985
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,780
Hey, Tyler. Happy birthday.

986
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,869
I'm paying for the red panda,
not this garbage! Deal's off!

987
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,914
Wait! Can garbage do this?
Uh-huh.

988
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,832
Or this? Stir the porridge.

989
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:33,919
Come on, guys!
Stir the porridge.

990
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:37,130
Are you feeling okay?

991
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,633
Guys, it's hard
to explain, but just, hmm...

992
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,967
Just trust me on this.

993
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,761
I can't panda anymore.
I'm sorry.

994
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,096
Okay, okay, okay. It's fine.

995
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:46,473
You don't have to do it.

996
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:47,974
We'll just, uh,
figure something...

997
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,267
I won't go.

998
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,853
What? Priya, you can't not go.

999
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,647
Jesse's your soul mate.

1000
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:54,814
But we only have enough

1001
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,441
- for three tickets.
- Then I'll stay home.

1002
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,526
Abby, no! I'll stay home.

1003
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,029
Guys, if we can't all go,

1004
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,198
then none of us should go.

1005
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,741
Right?

1006
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,506
Just one last time.

1007
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,132
Hey, Tyler!

1008
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,718
You want the panda?
You're getting the panda.

1009
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,721
Let's hear it
for the birthday boy!

1010
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,017
Yes!

1011
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,147
Go, Tyler! Go, Tyler!

1012
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,983
- Go, go, go, Tyler!
- Yeah!

1013
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,150
Okay!

1014
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,704
Yeah! Get it, girl!

1015
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,917
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1016
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,919
Oh, yeah!

1017
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,549
Faster! Faster! Whoo!

1018
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,676
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1019
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,803
Yeah!

1020
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,222
You sure
the hotel's all right?

1021
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,141
It'll do.
At least breakfast is free.

1022
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,184
Get some rest. You look tired.

1023
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,561
Good night, cuz.
Try that tea.

1024
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,730
- Good night, Ming.
- Good night.

1025
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,735
Ming, this is a critical time.

1026
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:25,822
Mei-Mei needs a strong hand,
now more than ever.

1027
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,700
Don't let her
out of your sight.

1028
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,118
I won't, Mother.

1029
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,559
Hmm. Oh.

1030
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,773
Oh.

1031
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,441
Oh, no.

1032
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,490
"Fur baby"?

1033
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,741
Oh!

1034
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,618
What?

1035
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,335
What...

1036
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,381
Mei-Mei. What is all...

1037
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,140
Yeah! We did it!
We are seeing 4-Town!

1038
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,308
- Whoo!
- Yes.

1039
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,520
Hey,
has anyone seen Mei?

1040
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,983
Dang. He is working you.

1041
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,402
What a diva!

1042
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,570
It'll all be worth it.

1043
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,911
Tomorrow, we are walking
into that concert girls

1044
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,956
and coming out women.

1045
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,375
Literally goosebumps.

1046
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,086
Hmm. What do you think
Jesse smells like?

1047
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,713
Milk chocolate and wet rocks.

1048
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,881
Wow!

1049
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,049
So manly.

1050
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,134
Oh, yes!

1051
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,094
It's happening,
Robaire Junior!

1052
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,679
You're finally gonna
meet your daddy!

1053
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,389
And your hot uncles!

1054
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,016
What? It's true.

1055
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,480
Mei, what if you
didn't do the ritual?

1056
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,108
What if you kept the panda?

1057
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,110
- What?
- Look at you!

1058
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,862
You're not the same
feather-dustin',

1059
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,946
straight-A, goody-goody...

1060
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,614
Who we never saw, like, ever.

1061
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,575
- Yeah.
- You're such a rebel now.

1062
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,244
Guys, I can't be
like this forever.

1063
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,246
My whole family would freak.

1064
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,206
Especially my mom.

1065
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,085
All her hopes and dreams
are pinned on me.

1066
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:47,255
I know.
But you've really changed

1067
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,215
and I'm proud of you.

1068
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,635
Just don't get rid
of all of it, you know?

1069
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,220
Yeah. If it weren't for you,

1070
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,722
none of this
would be happening.

1071
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,266
- You the bomb!
- Word. You da bomb, Mei.

1072
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,642
No, you da bomb.

1073
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,852
We all da bomb!

1074
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,396
Yes. Yes. Yes!

1075
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,647
We da bomb!

1076
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,441
4-Town, here we come!
- - Robaire, I love you!

1077
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,651
We're coming for you!
We are women!

1078
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,487
- We are women!
- We are hot!

1079
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,032
<i>All right,
homies, next up is 4-Town.</i>

1080
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,868
<i>The boys are coming
to Toronto on the 25th!</i>

1081
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,453
<i>So get your tickets now.</i>

1082
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,747
<i>And check it, they'll be
cranking open the SkyDome</i>

1083
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,373
<i>and performing under
a red lunar eclipse.</i>

1084
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,500
<i>It's gonna be galactic,
for sure.</i>

1085
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,834
Abby...

1086
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:28,505
you said the concert
was the 18th.

1087
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:32,425
It is! He's wrong!
Look! The 18th, Toronto!

1088
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,177
Uh...

1089
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:35,512
This says Toledo.

1090
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,638
What?

1091
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,644
Toledo?

1092
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,853
What the heck is Toledo?

1093
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,271
- Oh, no.
- What?

1094
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,440
4-Town's the same night
as the ritual?

1095
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,691
No!

1096
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,984
The same night?

1097
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,737
The same night? What?

1098
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,489
- Mei, chill.
- It's okay.

1099
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,032
No, it isn't!

1100
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,619
I can't miss 4-Town!
We worked so hard!

1101
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,206
But the ritual.
I'll let everyone down!

1102
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,000
- No, no, no!
- Hey, Panda Girl.

1103
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:09,879
What are you doing?
We want more rides.

1104
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,839
Buzz off, jerkface. I'm busy.

1105
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,258
Oh, snap!

1106
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,759
You gonna take that, Tyler?

1107
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,219
You want your money?

1108
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,971
Then get your butt
down here now!

1109
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,973
Forget your money,
and forget you!

1110
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:21,516
Mei! Let's just go.

1111
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,642
What about our deal?

1112
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,810
Shove your deal!

1113
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,436
Fine! Get out of here!

1114
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,355
Go back to your psycho mom

1115
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,774
and your creepy temple,
you freak!

1116
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,901
Mei, no!

1117
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,987
Take it back!

1118
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,154
Don't talk about my family
like that!

1119
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,322
- You're hurting him!
- Mei!

1120
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,032
- Mei-Mei, stop!
- I hate you! I hate...

1121
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,076
What is going on here?

1122
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,746
I'm sorry.

1123
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,749
Just get off of me. Please.

1124
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,757
I cannot believe

1125
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,842
you would
let your daughter do this!

1126
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,552
Do you understand
what she did to my boy?

1127
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,803
I am so sorry.

1128
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,306
She's never done
anything like this before.

1129
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:02,557
I don't know
what came over her.

1130
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,434
I don't want to hear
your apologies, okay?

1131
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,644
- I'm sorry again.
- She is an animal!

1132
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,772
All right, party's over!
Everyone, go home!

1133
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,371
I can't believe you girls
would use her like this!

1134
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,539
- What?
- But we didn't.

1135
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,624
No, we'd never.

1136
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,709
- What?
- I knew you were trouble.

1137
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,877
Putting all these thoughts

1138
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,171
into Mei-Mei's head,
parading her around.

1139
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,506
Now she's lying, sneaking out.

1140
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:38,051
She attacked
a defenseless boy.

1141
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,761
You think this is a joke?

1142
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:41,596
Do you know
how dangerous this is?

1143
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:45,099
We didn't mean to,
we just wanted to see 4-Town.

1144
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,727
4-Town! You manipulated her

1145
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,395
for a bunch
of tacky delinquents?

1146
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,856
- No! She wanted to...
- Don't you blame her.

1147
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,441
She is a good girl,

1148
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,068
and you've taken
advantage of her.

1149
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,778
Mei, tell her.

1150
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,287
- What?
- Dude!

1151
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,415
Come on, Mei-Mei.

1152
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,417
Let's go.

1153
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,258
Will call that way.

1154
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,095
All righty,
general admission, eh?

1155
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,304
How many tickets?

1156
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,350
Three, please.

1157
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,272
What is that?

1158
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,442
Um, I think it's coming
from the SkyDome, Mother.

1159
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,569
Four is the worst number.

1160
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,487
You know,
Vivian was due on the fourth,

1161
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,030
but I held her
in until the fifth...

1162
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,198
Quiet, Lily.

1163
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,283
Hurry up, everyone.

1164
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:27,285
It's almost time
to start the ritual.

1165
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,745
Nervous, Mei-Mei?

1166
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,621
- A little.
- Oh, well,

1167
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:34,751
I've got 50 years' experience
as a shaman.

1168
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,128
This will be a piece of cake.

1169
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,756
And mostly painless.

1170
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,883
Thanks, Mr. Gao.

1171
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,217
Wait, "mostly"?

1172
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,306
Long ago, the spirits
blessed the women

1173
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:51,350
of our family
with a great challenge.

1174
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,103
Mei-Mei, tonight is your turn.

1175
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,731
Like all the women
around this table,

1176
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,525
you too will banish
the beast within

1177
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:02,612
and finally become
your true self.

1178
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,449
May Sun Yee guide you
and keep you safe.

1179
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,658
- Hear, hear!
- That's right.

1180
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,743
Don't blow it.

1181
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:13,331
Uh... It's almost time.

1182
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,708
The red moon
is about to begin.

1183
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,585
Mei-Mei, go get ready.

1184
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:18,961
Yes, Mother.

1185
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,422
Oh, where are the instruments?

1186
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:23,925
It's so amazing!

1187
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,346
- Hmm. Huh?
- Jin!

1188
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,806
- Help clear the table!
- Uh-huh.

1189
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,561
Uh...

1190
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,647
Oh!

1191
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,440
<i>Is it on?</i>

1192
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:42,109
<i>4-Town, here we come!</i>

1193
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,319
Huh.

1194
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,570
<i>That's so gross.</i>

1195
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,113
Hmm.

1196
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,410
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1197
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,587
I hate you!

1198
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,469
Come in.

1199
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,221
Hey, Dad.

1200
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,139
I... I'm almost ready.

1201
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,599
Did you make this?

1202
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:17,395
Here, I'll erase it.

1203
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,148
What? We were
just being stupid.

1204
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,070
The panda's dangerous,
outta control.

1205
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:29,824
Huh. You sound
like your mother.

1206
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,703
What has she told you
about her panda?

1207
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:37,290
Nothing.
She won't talk about it.

1208
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,334
It was quite destructive.

1209
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,670
And big.

1210
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,965
She almost took out
half the temple.

1211
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,842
You... You saw it?

1212
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,302
Only once.

1213
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,013
She and your grandma
had a terrible fight.

1214
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,764
Over what?

1215
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:59,562
Your grandma
didn't approve of me.

1216
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:02,064
But you should've seen
your mom.

1217
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,443
She was incredible.

1218
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,906
But I'm a monster.

1219
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,202
People have all kinds
of sides to them, Mei.

1220
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,873
And some sides are messy.

1221
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:23,502
The point isn't to push
the bad stuff away,

1222
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,632
it's to make room for it,
live with it.

1223
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,554
Mei, erase it if you want,
but this side of you...

1224
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:36,474
made me laugh.

1225
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:41,646
<i>Dude, you're crazy!</i>

1226
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,106
<i>Come here!</i>

1227
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,151
Mei-Mei.

1228
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,404
It's time.

1229
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:04,543
Just follow my directions
and breathe.

1230
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:14,095
Now don't move
from the circle.

1231
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,388
You understand?

1232
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:17,682
For as long
as the red moon shines,

1233
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,893
the astral realm will be open.

1234
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,938
And this circle is the door.

1235
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,247
What are they saying?

1236
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:45,543
The door will open only if we
sing from our hearts.

1237
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,255
It doesn't matter what.
I like Tony Bennett,

1238
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:52,633
but your grandma, uh,
she's from old school.

1239
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,178
Now, focus on their voices.

1240
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:58,347
Let them guide you.

1241
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,939
Oh, Sun Yee, revered ancestor,

1242
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,691
hear us now.

1243
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:17,074
Guide this girl
through her inner storm.

1244
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,625
Louder! Louder!

1245
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,136
And return
the red panda spirit

1246
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,679
from where it came!

1247
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,636
Sun Yee.

1248
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,862
You can do it. Keep going!

1249
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,632
No!

1250
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,396
What happened?

1251
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,689
- What was that?
- Mei-Mei...

1252
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:54,773
Is everyone okay?

1253
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,941
Oh, my goodness,
I can't...

1254
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,026
Mei-Mei.

1255
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,403
It's okay. We can do it again.

1256
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:01,906
Mei-Mei?

1257
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:04,158
I'm keeping it.

1258
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,492
- What did she say?
- Keeping it?

1259
01:10:05,659 --> 01:10:06,911
I'm keeping it!

1260
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:08,078
- Oh, no!
- Mei-Mei!

1261
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:09,163
Stop her!

1262
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,289
- What are you doing?
- Stop, Mei-Mei!

1263
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,624
- Don't let her go!
- No!

1264
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,626
- Let go!
- What has come over you?

1265
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,419
Stop!
Get a hold of her!

1266
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,421
- Mei-Mei! Stop!
- Don't do this!

1267
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,590
Mei-Mei!

1268
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,758
No!

1269
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,510
I'm going to the concert!

1270
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,305
- Get back here!
- Mei-Mei! Stop!

1271
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,140
- A concert?
- No!

1272
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,727
This is a disaster.

1273
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,479
Unbelievable. Ming!

1274
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:34,730
Too good to be true.

1275
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,315
How could you let this happen?

1276
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,651
She's out of control!

1277
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,028
Ming, it's okay.

1278
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,238
Ming! Ming!
Answer me!

1279
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:43,322
What are we going to do
about this?

1280
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,407
How could she?

1281
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,412
How could she do this to...

1282
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,790
her own mother?

1283
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:04,927
Ming?

1284
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:08,305
Mei-Mei!

1285
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,644
Excuse me!

1286
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,464
Whoo! Yeah!

1287
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,092
4-Town!

1288
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:49,930
- Mei!
- Mei!

1289
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,724
- You're here!
- What are you doing here?

1290
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,518
I couldn't do it.

1291
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:58,188
The panda's a part of me,
and you guys are too.

1292
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,941
Mei, you threw us
under the bus.

1293
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,985
I know and I'm sorry.

1294
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,320
I've been, like, obsessed

1295
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,071
with my mom's approval
my whole life.

1296
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,574
I couldn't take losing it,

1297
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,036
but losing you guys
feels even worse.

1298
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,246
Well, too bad.

1299
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:16,248
'Cause you did.

1300
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,211
Robaire Junior?

1301
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:22,880
She's been
taking care of him 24/7.

1302
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,006
No.

1303
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,174
And singing him lullabies
every night!

1304
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,259
No, no, no, I haven't.

1305
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:28,969
They're lying.

1306
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:30,804
Here.

1307
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,222
Found him at Tyler's.

1308
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,146
4-Town forever?

1309
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,108
4-Town forever.

1310
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:45,569
- 4-Town forever.
- 4-Town forever!

1311
01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:47,571
Tyler?

1312
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,866
No! Tyler? Who's Tyler?
I don't know a...

1313
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,827
You are a 4-Townie?

1314
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:55,829
No! Stop!

1315
01:12:55,996 --> 01:12:56,997
- No way!
- Yeah!

1316
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:58,248
Welcome to the sisterhood!

1317
01:12:58,332 --> 01:12:59,500
Whatever, dorks.

1318
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:00,793
Cut it out!

1319
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:02,378
Your mom
must have gone nuclear.

1320
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,254
Who cares?
What's she gonna do?

1321
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,422
Ground me?

1322
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:12,471
4-Town! 4-Town! 4-Town!

1323
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,139
4-Town! 4-Town!

1324
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,521
Let's go!

1325
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:21,897
Is it starting? It's starting!

1326
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,065
Guys, hold me.

1327
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:28,320
Four, three, two, one!

1328
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,533
<i>Are you ready?</i>

1329
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:36,662
Oh, my gosh!

1330
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,248
Yeah! Z!

1331
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,624
I love you, man!

1332
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,168
Yeah! Yeah!

1333
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,132
Yes! Jesse!

1334
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:52,636
<i>Toronto! Who knows what's up?</i>

1335
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,598
Yes!

1336
01:14:00,352 --> 01:14:01,437
<i>You want it?</i>

1337
01:14:01,603 --> 01:14:02,604
<i>I want it</i>

1338
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,773
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

1339
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:06,942
<i>- You want it?
- I want it</i>

1340
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,445
<i>Give me one, two, three, four</i>

1341
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,905
<i>You wanted it
You went for it</i>

1342
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,157
<i>And, baby, you got it</i>

1343
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:15,951
<i>I wanted it
I went for it</i>

1344
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:21,707
<i>And, baby, I did it on my own</i>

1345
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:26,837
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1346
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:29,965
<i>Own</i>

1347
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,133
<i>Did it on my own</i>

1348
01:14:31,216 --> 01:14:32,968
Mei-Mei!

1349
01:14:38,765 --> 01:14:39,766
No way!

1350
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:41,894
Is this part of the show?

1351
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:46,190
Is this special effects?

1352
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:47,774
Help! Help!

1353
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,110
Mei-Mei!

1354
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,280
Where are you?

1355
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,074
Mom?

1356
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,743
Mei-Mei!

1357
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,627
- I want a refund.
- What's her problem?

1358
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,295
Mei!

1359
01:15:15,802 --> 01:15:17,095
It was just getting good!

1360
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,347
This isn't cool.

1361
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:23,268
- Mei! Mei!
- Dad?

1362
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:24,645
We have to save your mother!

1363
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:25,896
She's gone loco!

1364
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,023
Mei, we have to do
the ritual again.

1365
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,858
What happened? She's huge!

1366
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,235
I told you she was big!

1367
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,569
That big?

1368
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,613
Mei-Mei!

1369
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:35,864
Ming!
She's your daughter!

1370
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,032
Mei!

1371
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:38,325
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her!

1372
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:41,870
You are in big trouble,
young lady!

1373
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,038
Mom! Let go!

1374
01:15:43,163 --> 01:15:45,207
I'm shutting this down,

1375
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,042
right now!

1376
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,462
Everyone, go home!

1377
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:52,089
Where are your parents?

1378
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,007
Put some clothes on!

1379
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:59,596
This isn't you!

1380
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,558
This is me!

1381
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,898
- Mei-Mei!
- Mei! Are you hurt?

1382
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:13,527
I'm not your little
Mei-Mei anymore!

1383
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,654
I lied, Mom!

1384
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,822
What?

1385
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,366
It was my idea
to hustle the panda.

1386
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:22,160
My idea
to go to Tyler's party!

1387
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:24,496
It was all me!

1388
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,123
I like boys!

1389
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,083
I like loud music!

1390
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,210
I like gyrating!

1391
01:16:30,377 --> 01:16:32,838
I'm 13! Deal with it!

1392
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,184
The ritual.
Everyone in position.

1393
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:48,228
Mei-Mei, keep her busy.

1394
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:49,938
Oh, I'll keep her busy.

1395
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,566
Where's Jin? Jin!

1396
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:56,528
Mei!
Keep her in the circle!

1397
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,614
Get back here!

1398
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:00,115
Make me!

1399
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,534
You think
you're so mature!

1400
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,411
Lying to me!

1401
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:06,913
Blaming me!

1402
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,250
How could you be so, so...

1403
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,127
crass?

1404
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,005
Oh!
That's nothing!

1405
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,923
You wanna see crass?

1406
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,510
- What are you doing?
- You like that? Yes!

1407
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,512
- Stop moving like that!
- What's wrong?

1408
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:24,389
- Is this bothering you?
- Stop it!

1409
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:25,724
Yeah, Mei!

1410
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,684
Destroy her
with your big butt!

1411
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:29,019
Yeah! Go, go, go!

1412
01:17:29,394 --> 01:17:31,188
Start singing now!

1413
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:32,397
Ladies!

1414
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,903
Stop!

1415
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:40,781
Sing louder!

1416
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:42,199
We're trying.

1417
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,618
- Stop it!
- Let's get out of here!

1418
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:45,994
Come on!

1419
01:17:46,119 --> 01:17:47,829
- Huh? Take it, Mom! Take it!
- No!

1420
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:52,417
Stop it! Stop!

1421
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:00,133
All I wanted...

1422
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:04,012
...was to go to a concert!

1423
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,641
I never went to concerts!

1424
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,227
I put my family first!

1425
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,688
I tried to be a good daughter!

1426
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,901
Well, sorry I'm not perfect!

1427
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,195
Sorry I'm not good enough!

1428
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:24,157
And sorry
I'll never be like you!

1429
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:40,882
Oh, no!

1430
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,884
Mom... Mom!

1431
01:18:52,644 --> 01:18:53,770
No!

1432
01:18:57,357 --> 01:19:00,736
Mom!
You have to get in the circle!

1433
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,030
Wake up!

1434
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,075
I'm sorry!

1435
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:09,911
Mom? Come on.

1436
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,747
Please!

1437
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:21,131
Sun Yee, give me strength.

1438
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,936
- Pull, Mei-Mei!
- Grandma?

1439
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,355
I am not losing my daughter.

1440
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:38,815
Don't just stand there!

1441
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:57,751
Make room
for your elders, Mei-Mei!

1442
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,586
- What?
- We're with you!

1443
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:01,421
But what are you doing?
What if you can't turn back?

1444
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,340
- Your mom needs us!
- She's family!

1445
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,300
Less talking, more pulling!

1446
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:08,053
- This fur is so itchy!
- Quiet, Lily!

1447
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:21,191
Louder!

1448
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:22,984
Sing from the heart!

1449
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:25,445
Louder!
The circle isn't working!

1450
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,792
<i>- Never met nobody
- Nobody</i>

1451
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,586
<i>Never met, never met,
never met</i>

1452
01:20:41,753 --> 01:20:45,882
<i>Like</i>

1453
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,593
<i>You</i>

1454
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,562
<i>Get up</i>

1455
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:01,189
<i>I never met nobody</i>

1456
01:21:01,481 --> 01:21:02,858
<i>Like you</i>

1457
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,861
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

1458
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:07,529
<i>It's true</i>

1459
01:21:07,612 --> 01:21:11,867
<i>But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do</i>

1460
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,288
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1461
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:21,501
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1462
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:25,839
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

1463
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:30,468
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

1464
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,555
<i>I'll never not be
your ride or die</i>

1465
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:37,142
<i>All right!</i>

1466
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,439
Huh?

1467
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,984
Mom? Mom!

1468
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:02,417
Mom? Are you okay?
We have to...

1469
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:05,170
Mom?

1470
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:09,341
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

1471
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,887
What happened?

1472
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,765
I... I hurt her.

1473
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:18,808
Who?

1474
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,101
My mom!

1475
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:24,606
I got so angry,
and I lost control.

1476
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,818
I'm just so sick
of being perfect!

1477
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:31,279
I'm never gonna be
good enough for her.

1478
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:33,490
Or anyone.

1479
01:22:46,836 --> 01:22:48,880
I know it feels that way.

1480
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,299
Like, all the time.

1481
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:56,805
But... it isn't true.

1482
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,436
Come on.

1483
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:35,635
Really? I could explode
at any moment.

1484
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:37,012
- We have to find them.
- Where are they?

1485
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,514
- Finally.
- Hurry, hurry!

1486
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:40,765
Where have you been?
Come on!

1487
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:43,101
- Let's get the lead out!
- Ladies.

1488
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,448
- I'm sorry.
- Shh!

1489
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,117
You don't have to apologize.

1490
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,079
I'm your mother.

1491
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:12,839
May Sun Yee guide you
and keep you safe.

1492
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,426
One at a time, ladies.
And quickly.

1493
01:24:18,595 --> 01:24:19,596
That's it?

1494
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,306
Mei-Mei's keeping the panda?

1495
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,559
It's her life. Now move.

1496
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,085
Go ahead. It's okay.

1497
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:13,316
No.

1498
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:17,028
Mei-Mei, please.
Just come with me.

1499
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:21,241
I'm changing, Mom.

1500
01:25:21,908 --> 01:25:25,286
I'm finally figuring out
who I am.

1501
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,582
But...

1502
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,544
I'm scared it'll take me away
from you.

1503
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,297
Me too.

1504
01:25:38,258 --> 01:25:39,926
I see you, Mei-Mei.

1505
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,971
You try to make
everyone happy,

1506
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:45,265
but are so hard on yourself.

1507
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:48,143
And if I taught you that...

1508
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,604
I'm sorry.

1509
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,525
So, don't hold back.

1510
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,485
For anyone.

1511
01:26:02,198 --> 01:26:03,950
The farther you go,

1512
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,411
the prouder I'll be.

1513
01:26:24,804 --> 01:26:28,558
I'm not going
to regret this, am I?

1514
01:26:57,045 --> 01:27:00,715
<i>I'm Meilin Lee,
and ever since I turned 13,</i>

1515
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:04,260
<i>life's been a lot.</i>

1516
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:08,181
<i>People still talk about
Pandapocalypse 2002.</i>

1517
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:11,142
<i>Mom and I just call it...</i>

1518
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,435
<i>growing pains.</i>

1519
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:17,232
This thing's hungry
all the time.

1520
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:19,275
Eat up, little one.
Oh, you're so hungry.

1521
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:21,027
- Munch, munch, munch.
- What?

1522
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:23,404
Mr. Gao had to put
her panda in something.

1523
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,073
You should see Grandma's.

1524
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:28,701
Hmph! So unlucky.

1525
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,290
You ready?

1526
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:35,541
Let's do this.

1527
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:38,253
- Hello! Welcome to our temple!
- What up, Toronto!

1528
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:39,629
- Get in here!
- Yes, come on in.

1529
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:42,173
And things at the temple
have never been better.

1530
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,384
O-M-G! That looks so cute!

1531
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:47,303
Our temple
is the oldest in Toronto.

1532
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:51,349
And the only one that's home
to the great red panda.

1533
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,145
Say "bamboo leaves!"

1534
01:27:56,312 --> 01:27:58,106
- Bamboo leaves!
- Mei!

1535
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,565
- Hey!
- Guys!

1536
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:01,025
- What's up?
- Bring it in!

1537
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,986
Ready to get your karaoke on?

1538
01:28:03,152 --> 01:28:04,279
Totally.

1539
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,739
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!

1540
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:09,659
Hold on. You're not
going out like that, are you?

1541
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,995
My panda,
my choice, Mom.

1542
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:15,581
I'll be back
before dinner, okay?

1543
01:28:15,665 --> 01:28:17,834
Fine. Oh, um...

1544
01:28:17,917 --> 01:28:19,627
You're welcome to join us.

1545
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:21,129
For Mr. Lee's cooking?

1546
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,547
- Uh, yeah!
- We're so there.

1547
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,007
Don't load up on junk.

1548
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:25,717
Thanks for covering
for me, Dad.

1549
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:27,343
Have fun!

1550
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:30,013
And I'll beatbox.
And I can bleach my hair, too.

1551
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:31,723
<i>And, yeah...</i>

1552
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,143
<i>sometimes I miss
how things were,</i>

1553
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,521
<i>but nothing stays
the same forever.</i>

1554
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:41,816
O-M-G! I'm so excited
for the new album.

1555
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,235
<i>We've all got an inner beast.</i>

1556
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:46,237
<i>We've all got
a messy, loud,</i>

1557
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,490
<i>weird part of ourselves
hidden away.</i>

1558
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,201
<i>And a lot of us
never let it out.</i>

1559
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,120
<i>But I did.</i>

1560
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:56,914
<i>How about you?</i>

1561
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:03,755
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1562
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:08,926
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1563
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,638
<i>Had friends
and I've had buddies</i>

1564
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:13,723
<i>It's true</i>

1565
01:29:13,806 --> 01:29:18,519
<i>But they don't turn my tummy
The way you do</i>

1566
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:23,066
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1567
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:28,071
<i>Yeah</i>

1568
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:36,371
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1569
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:41,167
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

1570
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:45,922
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

1571
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:49,258
<i>I'll never not be your ride
or die</i>

1572
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:50,676
<i>All right</i>

1573
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,971
<i>Let's call it what it is
It's a masterpiece</i>

1574
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,682
<i>Got a whole lotta love
for them city streets</i>

1575
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,226
<i>Tonight is the place to be</i>

1576
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:00,561
<i>Got a big boom box
and a new CD</i>

1577
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,980
<i>- Come on!
- Everybody, let's tear it up</i>

1578
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,400
<i>If you want mad skills
You can share with us</i>

1579
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,568
<i>Everybody just stop and stare</i>

1580
01:30:07,652 --> 01:30:10,196
<i>And you know why, it's me
Robaire</i>

1581
01:30:10,279 --> 01:30:11,364
<i>Woo!</i>

1582
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:13,616
<i>Unh!</i>

1583
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:18,121
<i>Let's go!</i>

1584
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:22,542
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1585
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:27,004
<i>I'm never not by your side
Your side, your side</i>

1586
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:31,717
<i>I'm never gonna let you cry
Oh, cry, don't cry</i>

1587
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,929
<i>I'll never not be your ride
or die</i>

1588
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,431
<i>All right</i>

1589
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:40,226
<i>Like you</i>

1590
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:42,478
<i>Like you</i>

1591
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:44,689
<i>Like you</i>

1592
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,983
<i>Like you, like you</i>

1593
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,110
<i>Like you</i>

1594
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:51,362
<i>Like you</i>

1595
01:30:52,655 --> 01:30:54,574
<i>Like you, like you</i>

01:30:54,657 --> 01:30:59,036
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

<i>But they don't turn my tummy

1600
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:12,758
<i>I've never met nobody like you</i>

1601
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:19,724
<i>You're never not on my mind
Oh, my, oh, my</i>

1602
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:24,312

1605
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,529
<i>All right</i>

1606
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:40,244
<i>Ooh</i>

1607
01:31:41,537 --> 01:31:43,831
<i>Yeah</i>

1608
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:47,460
<i>Yeah</i>

1609
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:54,383
<i>Heavy rain from my cloudy eye</i>

1610
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,802
<i>Every time you say</i>

1611
01:31:56,886 --> 01:32:00,556
<i>That it isn't why
I used to call you babe</i>

1612
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,684
<i>But you're the light
of my life</i>

1613
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:13,069
<i>I drove by your house
29 times today</i>

1614
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:21,285
<i>And nobody else
could make me feel this way</i>

1615
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:26,874
<i>Nobody else</i>

1616
01:32:29,835 --> 01:32:33,965
<i>Nobody else, nobody</i>

1617
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:38,928
<i>'Cause you've opened my eyes
and stolen my heart</i>

1618
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:42,932
<i>You make me believe
that love can be hard</i>

<i>My one true love</i>

1624

<i>Heavy rain on a Saturday</i>

1625
01:33:14,714 --> 01:33:18,342
<i>When you said my name
in the saddest way</i>

1626
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:20,636
<i>Nothing numbs the pain</i>

1627
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:24,515
<i>You're still the light
of my life</i>

1628
01:33:27,018 --> 01:33:32,940
<i>I drove by your house
10,000 times last year</i>

1629
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:40,948
<i>Nobody else
wanted to dry my tears</i>

1630
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:47,455
<i>Nobody else</i>

1631
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:54,295
<i>Nobody else, nobody else</i>

1632

<i>'Cause you've opened my eyes
and stolen my heart</i>

<i>And I can never survive
a minute apart</i>

1635

<i>You are my one true love</i>

1636
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:21,072
<i>My one true love</i>

1637
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:24,992
<i>My heaven above</i>

1638
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:29,830

<i>You know it's us, yeah</i>

1644
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:04,281
<i>You wanted it, you went for it</i>

1645
01:35:04,365 --> 01:35:06,617
<i>- And baby, you got it

<i>Ooh-oh</i>

1651
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:24,051
<i>I'm making paper
like it's origami</i>

1652
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:28,681
<i>I only came to win the game
Can't stop me</i>
