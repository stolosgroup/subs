00:22:00,382 --> 00:22:03,769
Now, we agreed on 200,
I even put on 300.

No mas.</i>

This guy's fatter than fuck.

335
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:46,186
I'm already 1500 pounds
overweight.

336
00:22:47,427 --> 00:22:52,369
Either I fly the big fella,
or I fly your product.

runway any longer.

00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:18,493
Hey, Jorge.
Come here, give me it.

25 miles off shore.

349

That's platform 14,

<i>All we gots a
porta potty out back and...</i>

480
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:07,585
I think that'd be cruel
and unusual punishment, right?

481
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:11,497
Well, I'll be sure 'n give 'em a
good whup for it on Monday, though.

482
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:13,567
All right.

483
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,741
Thank you.

484
00:35:38,692 --> 00:35:40,532
Front door's open.

485
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:53,674
Shh, it's okay.

486
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:59,519
That's an easy fix.

487
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,582
I gotta...

488
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,711
Get in. Come on.

489
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,553
Oh, shit.

490
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,624
We gotta make this quick.

So, this is all yours.

493
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:51,586
Including everything between
here and your house.

494
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:53,647
Almost 2,000 acres.

495
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:55,618
What do you think?

496
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,489
I own all this?

497
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,529
Oh, yeah.

498
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,642
This whole airport?

499
00:37:08,672 --> 00:37:10,731
Yeah. Congratulations.

500
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:38,537
AK-47s.

501
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,448
Soviet-made for the PLO.

502
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:46,611
The Israelis captured these,
and then secretly traded them to us.

503
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:50,560
And you're gonna
fly them to Nicaragua.

504
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,720
Uh, you didn't say
nothin' 'bout guns.

505
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,491
It's a war, Barry.

506
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:58,662
Freedom fighters can't put up
much of a fight if they aren't armed.

507
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:00,633
This was the deal.

508
00:38:00,673 --> 00:38:03,530
Or would you rather be
in a Colombian prison?

509
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:10,615
This is every current law enforcement
investigation in the Gulf Coast.

510
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,516
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.

511
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:17,518
These maps will help you
avoid all of 'em.

512
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,756
Holy shit.

513
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:24,596
You just fly where they ain't.

514
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,481
Everything in this hangar's mine.

515
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:42,541
Oh, yeah.

516
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,622
That truck's mine.

517
00:38:44,627 --> 00:38:45,648
Mm-hmm.

518
00:38:45,653 --> 00:38:48,494
- Tools are mine.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:50,533
This airplane is mine.

520
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,633
Bag is mine.

521
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:57,605
What bag?

522
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,660
I fed the kids.
They're sleepin'.

523
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:29,482
I unpacked the car.

524
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:30,802
That is good.

525
00:39:31,511 --> 00:39:33,712
Fixed the sink.
Just the valve.

526
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:36,751
See, I told you,
that was gonna be easy.

527
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:40,683
Fuck, Barry!

528
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:43,695
Okay, all right, all right.
Okay.

529
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:46,497
Ima come clean.

530
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:50,136
I don't work for TWA
no more.

531
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:53,435
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?

532
00:39:55,066 --> 00:39:56,266
No, ma'am.

533
00:39:59,578 --> 00:40:01,598
You gotta take care
of this family.

534
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:02,778
'Cause I will take the kids.

535
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:05,577
I will go right back to working
for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

536
00:40:05,677 --> 00:40:07,708
Luce, what I'm workin' on...

537
00:40:07,718 --> 00:40:10,490
- Barry, I'm six months pregnant.
- It's top secret.

538
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,679
I need a fridge.

539
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,631
I need beds for our children.

540
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:16,622
I need a stove,
a fucking washing machine.

541
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,292
Washing machine over there.

542
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:29,175
Let me just...

543
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:39,385
Is this all legal?

544
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,187
All right, what I'm about to tell you...
Now, you-you...

545
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:48,390
You gotta swear you can't
ever tell anybody this, Lucy.

546
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:51,259
All right?

547
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:59,171
I am working...
for the CIA.

This is Don Adolfo Calero.

He works for your

578

We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.

579
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:00,801
You bring your American
guns to Colombia,

580
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:03,960
deliver our cocaine here
to the Contras,

581
00:44:04,801 --> 00:44:07,859
the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,

582
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:09,840
and everybody's happy.

583
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:14,442
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.

<i>Lucho Castellanos y su Grupo -

<i>They just want to make money.

00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,953
<i>Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel
wanted guns.</i>

588
00:44:25,993 --> 00:44:28,965
<i>So they worked out
a little trade.</i>

<i>What was I gonna tell 'em?</i>

<i>Here's how the operation worked.</i>

592
00:44:35,804 --> 00:44:37,765
<i>I'd load up the guns at Mena.</i>

593
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:41,838
<i>Then, using Schafer's intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement</i>

594
00:44:41,878 --> 00:44:45,539
<i>and fly straight to the
Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.</i>

<i>Colombians, well,

596

<i>Then I'd load up with fresh powder</i>

597

<i>and fly on to the

<i>The Contras hid the coke in

<i>On the way back,
I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.</i>

605
00:45:20,397 --> 00:45:22,556
<i>Then I'd dump it all
in the swamps in Louisiana.</i>

606
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:31,429
<i>The operation got so big,
I had to get some help.</i>

607

<i>Pete Dubois, manufactured guns

<i>he had a knack for selling pot.</i>

Where are they going?

We need to borrow some
of your land.

629
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:11,519
They want you to
fly 'em up here to-to train.

Fuck!

960
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,606
Sorry, it's my wife.

961
01:10:09,612 --> 01:10:11,483
- Hey Luce, you hear me?
<i>- Yes.</i>

962
01:10:11,523 --> 01:10:13,584
- Honey? You all right?
<i>- Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

963
01:10:13,624 --> 01:10:16,596
Honey, I hate to tell you this
right now, but JB's been arrested.

964
01:10:16,601 --> 01:10:18,397
- That little shit.
<i>- What happened?</i>

965
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:20,338
I don't know. He got caught
with a lot of money.

966
01:10:20,538 --> 01:10:22,139
- That dumbfuck.
<i>- Honey...</i>

967
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:23,531
What do you want
me to do here, babe?

968
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:25,542
There ain't
nothin' to do, really.

969
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:26,813
Uh, I'm just in a meeting.

970
01:10:26,818 --> 01:10:28,514
And we'll go over that
when I get home.

971
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:30,475
All right? I got-
I'll take care of that.

972
01:10:30,515 --> 01:10:32,486
- All right?
<i>- All right, hurry up, Barry.</i>

973
01:10:32,516 --> 01:10:34,387
You just sit tight.
I love you.

974

977
01:10:46,474 --> 01:10:47,465
1500?

978
01:10:47,505 --> 01:10:49,416
<i>Si.</i> In one go.

979
01:10:50,517 --> 01:10:51,507
In one go?

<i>Si.</i>

981
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,481
Well, we ain't never
done that before.

982
01:10:56,891 --> 01:10:58,693
Sanctuary isn't cheap.

983
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:00,564
That's a lot

984
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:01,694
Can you do it?

985
01:11:02,705 --> 01:11:05,637
Yeah, I'm gonna get home...

986
01:11:05,677 --> 01:11:08,668
Right now. I'm gonna leave.
Then uh, we'll figure it out.

987
01:11:08,708 --> 01:11:10,479
I'll figure it out.

988
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:19,455
Get it fucking done.

989
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:24,598
Fucking lawyer
doesn't know shit.

990
01:11:24,638 --> 01:11:27,631
I got two fucking priors, man.
And he doesn't understand.

991
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:29,672
No, no, no.
He does understand.

992
01:11:30,442 --> 01:11:31,843
And you gotta do
what he tells you to do.

993
01:11:31,848 --> 01:11:33,344
<i>No, he doesn't, man.</i>

994

- JB.

996
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:39,658
JB, just...
hold on.

997
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,731
Barry?
Barry, are you there?

998
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:46,632
Daddy!

999

Hey, darlin'.

1000
01:11:48,673 --> 01:11:50,574
What's that?
Hold on.

1001
01:11:50,614 --> 01:11:51,705
- Yeah?
<i>- Barry.</i>

1002
01:11:51,745 --> 01:11:53,886
We've been trying
to get a hold of you, <i>amigo.</i>

1003
01:11:53,891 --> 01:11:56,448
<i>Yeah, I know that, amigo. Listen,
could you hold on, I'll be right back.</i>

1004
01:12:03,563 --> 01:12:04,633
- JB?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1005
01:12:04,673 --> 01:12:06,735
<i>There's some people
that wanna talk to me.</i>

1006
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:11,507
No, no no. You don't talk to
anyone about anything.

1007
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:13,038
<i>Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to.</i>

1008
01:12:13,043 --> 01:12:14,539
<i>And you keep your
fucking mouth shut.</i>

1009
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:16,751
<i>- I'm taking care of this.</i>
- Okay.

1010
01:12:19,592 --> 01:12:22,684
Listen, Jorge, we gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.

1011
01:12:22,784 --> 01:12:25,386
Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.

1012
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:26,486
<i>We have product to move.</i>

1013
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:28,668
I understand <i>amigo</i>,
but I-I got a family situation.

1014
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:31,669
<i>Eh, your brother-in-law.
We know all about it.</i>

1015
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,552
<i>- We'll handle it, amigo.</i>
- No, no, no, no.

1016
01:12:34,557 --> 01:12:37,754
- I don't want you to handle it.
<i>- Barry, listen.</i>

1017
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:40,626
- I got it. I got this.
- Barry, listen to me.

1018
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:44,598
We'll handle it, okay?
So don't worry.

1019
01:12:44,603 --> 01:12:46,699
<i>- We'll talk business later.</i>
- Jorge...

1020
01:13:15,747 --> 01:13:18,719
Barry, they don-they don't know
about them suitcases you got.

1021
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:20,260
or what you got in them planes,
the guns you got.

1022
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,561
They don't know anything about it.

1023
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:23,692
We're good, man.

1024
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,564
I can't fix this.
You hear?

1025
01:13:26,764 --> 01:13:31,607
They're gonna give you 10-
10 years for not talkin'.

1026
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,738
That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.

1027
01:13:33,778 --> 01:13:35,629
I didn't say anything, man.

1028
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,651
You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.

1029
01:13:41,564 --> 01:13:42,754
Where we going, man?

1030
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:50,639
You serious?
I'm fucking family.

1031
01:13:54,611 --> 01:13:55,772
We're family!

1032
01:13:58,784 --> 01:14:02,696
That's right. Right.
We're a family.

1033
01:14:04,697 --> 01:14:07,689
- What's that?
- Inside's a passport...

1034
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:10,672
first-class ticket to
Bora Bora and enough cash...

1035
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:13,673
Enough cash to make
a damn good life for yourself.

1036
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:15,855
Now, you're gonna
get in that car,

1037
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:20,561
and you're gonna drive straight
to Dallas Fort Worth Airport

1038
01:14:20,567 --> 01:14:22,319
and nowhere else.

1039
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:25,821
You don't even
stop to take a piss.

1040
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:28,802
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

1041
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:33,805
Good luck, kid.

1042
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:46,664
I'll tell you what, Barry.

1043
01:14:46,694 --> 01:14:49,636
I'm gonna send you a
goddamn address, okay, Barry?

1044
01:14:49,641 --> 01:14:52,757
You're gonna start sending
me cash on the fucking regular.

1045
01:14:52,762 --> 01:14:55,639
You understand?
You hear me?

1046
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,665
Oh, and Barry...

1047
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,787
Fuck you, man!
Fuck you and my cunt sister!

1048
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:15,632

Money every week, asshole!

1050
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,861
What the fuck?

1051
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:40,787
What?
Oh, shit.

1052
01:16:14,808 --> 01:16:16,779
Hey, hey! Barry!

1053
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:32,729
Hey, Barry!

1054
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,761
Barry!

1055
01:16:34,766 --> 01:16:36,462
Yeah, Bill, what do you need?
What do you need?

1056
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:38,063
Man, man, I'm like
freakin' out, man.

1057
01:16:38,068 --> 01:16:39,874
What is goin' on with JB?

1058
01:16:40,844 --> 01:16:43,876
- Huh?
- Don't worry about JB.

1059
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:45,827
What if he talks, man?

1060
01:16:45,832 --> 01:16:49,689
- He ain't gonna.
- Yeah, but what if he does?

1061
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:53,763
- He ain't gonna talk, Bill.
- How do you know?

1062
01:16:53,803 --> 01:16:56,865
I am fucking positive.

1063
01:17:01,687 --> 01:17:02,948
Okay, man.

1064
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,720
Good, I'm gonna trust
you on this one, man.

1065
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,921
Good.

1066
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:16,166
<i>In calendar year, your
operations have transported</i>

1067
01:17:16,171 --> 01:17:18,868
10,500 Russian AKs
to the Contras.

1068
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:19,968
Yeah.

1069
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:24,022
5,000 of which, have found
themselves in the hands

1070
01:17:24,027 --> 01:17:25,688
of the Colombian Cartel.

1071
01:17:25,693 --> 01:17:28,214
- Right, but...
- Out of the 916 Contras

1072
01:17:28,219 --> 01:17:30,826
brought in to the
United States to train,

1073
01:17:30,831 --> 01:17:32,827
only half made it back
to Nicaragua.

1074
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:35,959
- Half is...
- The other half are in the wild...

1075
01:18:00,714 --> 01:18:02,735
What's going on here?

1076
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:06,748
Oh, yeah. We had to send
the Contras home.

1077
01:18:06,788 --> 01:18:08,989
- Home?
- Yeah.

1078
01:18:09,294 --> 01:18:11,080
They weren't fighting.

1079
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,902
That's the reality
of that situation.

1080
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:19,795
You know, it didn't help that
their guns were in Colombia.

1081
01:18:19,805 --> 01:18:21,236
Did it, Barry?

1082
01:18:31,864 --> 01:18:34,735
So...

1083
01:18:37,907 --> 01:18:39,688
What now?

1084
01:18:39,888 --> 01:18:41,789
We'll call you.

1085
01:18:43,981 --> 01:18:47,012
Call me?
Schafer?

1086
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:49,424
Hey, Schafer.

1087
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,175
Who the fuck's Schafer?

1088
01:18:56,838 --> 01:18:59,841
Okay, everybody.
You know the drill.

1089
01:18:59,846 --> 01:19:01,332
Everybody gets a burn bag.

1090
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:03,873
Into it, you put anything
with Barry Seal's face

1091
01:19:03,883 --> 01:19:05,945
or name on it.

1092
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:10,387
Come on, boys.
We gotta move.

1093
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:12,989
We gotta get all this
stuff outta here.

1094
01:19:13,029 --> 01:19:16,711
- Pete. What, everything?
- Come on, boys, lets go.

1095
01:19:16,721 --> 01:19:18,802
We gotta move this out.
Let's go! Let's go!

1096
01:19:18,807 --> 01:19:20,903
Into the burn bag, go!

1097
01:19:20,908 --> 01:19:23,945
Purchase orders,
aircraft invoices,

1098
01:19:24,776 --> 01:19:26,797
Need a team here,
let's move it out.

1099
01:19:27,397 --> 01:19:29,809
Oh, shit, man.
Look at all these guns.

1100
01:19:29,819 --> 01:19:31,261
We gotta move all of it.

1101
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:32,761
Where are we supposed
to put all this stuff?

1102
01:19:32,791 --> 01:19:33,952
Just get it off my property.

1103
01:19:33,962 --> 01:19:35,903
Anything with the words "Mena".

1104
01:19:35,908 --> 01:19:41,847
Fuel bills, memos, names,
directives, photos, anything like that,

1105
01:19:41,852 --> 01:19:43,838
anything that can link us with him,
you put in the burn bag...

1106
01:19:43,878 --> 01:19:45,939
and then what do you do with it?

1107
01:19:45,944 --> 01:19:47,400
- Burn it.
- You burn it.

1108
01:19:48,005 --> 01:19:49,912
Bob, I need a little help

It's the Governor.

1143
01:22:03,034 --> 01:22:06,036
Put him through. Clear the room.
Take him with you.

1144
01:22:06,076 --> 01:22:10,108
Yeah?
What do you need, Bill?

1145
01:22:10,148 --> 01:22:11,089
Did you all know

1146
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,511
that Caddies have more trunk space

1147
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:14,152

1148
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:16,983
I'll give each and
every one of you a Caddy.

1149
01:22:18,024 --> 01:22:20,815
- Huh?
- You'd do that for all of us?

Add another 20 for bribery?

1153
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,980
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just offerin'
you Caddies for your troubles.

1154
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,881
What trouble, Seal?

1155
01:22:30,886 --> 01:22:32,943
Well, bringing me down here, for one.
