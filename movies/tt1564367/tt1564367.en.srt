-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,642
I'm so happy you
picked this dress, Veruca!

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,768
You look beautiful.
Doesn't she?

4
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,129
You guys,
I'm getting married!

5
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,964
I'm getting married!

6
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,644
Not without your veil,
you're not.

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,047
Where is that bad boy?

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,491
Oh, I think
I left it upstairs.

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,330
Don't worry. I'll get it,

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,040
sis.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,684
She is so annoying.

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,410
And so ugly.

13
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,324
She looks like
Karl Malden.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,606
I know, and
she's gonna be

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,722
my sister-in-law
in an hour!

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,484
How are you
gonna deal with that?

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,489
I'm just gonna lay
down the law for Danny.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,162
We're seeing his goofy family
as little as possible.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,810
You sure he's
gonna go along with that?

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,008
Danny doesn't say no to me.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,289
Believe me,
I have him well-trained.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,564
So, tell us, what happened
with Eric last night?

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,885
So, I told him if he wanted
to stop the wedding,

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,520
he had to speak now
or forever hold his peace.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,051
And what'd he say?

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,611
He said he's never
gonna settle down,

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,364
and I should just go
ahead and marry Danny.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,449
Did he give you a
wedding present, huh?

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,885
You're so horny!
Yeah.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,569
I guess you could
call it that.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,050
You're so bad!

32
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,202
It's the last time, I swear.

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,566
Yeah, right!

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,041
Danny is so sweet
and considerate.

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,122
And he's gonna
be a cardiologist.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,009
So, I'm marrying him

37
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,048
and that zucchini in
the middle of his face.

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,730
His parents
are disgusting, too!

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,723
Close your eyes
when he's on top!

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,609
And your thighs!

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,402
Cuz, I'm so sorry.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,244
Yikes, that hurt.

43
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,165
That was me, Danny Maccabee,
20 years ago.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,321
Pathetic, huh?

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,651
So, I'm halfway done
boozing away my sorrows,

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,405
when something
pretty interesting happened.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,683
Oh, baby, you're
like a Pop Tart,

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,728
hot and sweet!

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,921
Hey, mami!

50
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,770
You must play the
trumpet or something,

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,003
'cause you're making me
feel all horny and stuff!

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,647
You dropped your purse.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,171
Can I just sit
for 10 seconds

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,521
and not get hit on?
Thank you.

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,283
I was just letting you know
you dropped your purse.

56
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,608
I'm sorry. I thought...
That's fine, that's fine.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,202
I'm sure you didn't meet the
lady who gave you that ring

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,123
in a meat market like this.

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,766
School cafeteria.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,969
How long you been married?

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,888
I was gonna
tell hen I really was.

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,882
But I didn't want her to know
what a loser I was,

63
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,566
so I stretched
the truth a little.

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,727
Six years.

65
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,531
Where's your wife tonight?

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,646
I stopped asking that
question a long time ago.

67
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,406
That's terrible.

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,130
My wife says
I work too much.

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,689
Trying to provide for her,
her shopping addiction,

70
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,165
and crack.

71
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,970
Why don't you
just leave her?

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,971
The children.

73
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,803
All 14 of them.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,367
I just,
I like to adopt,

75
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,807
and I don't wanna
stop doing that.

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,005
You poor guy.

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,164
You wanna get outta here?

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,085
And so I discovered

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,049
the power of the wedding ring.

80
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,810
The symbol of
my humiliation

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,281
had become a tool to
get back on the horse.

82
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,170
Are you kidding me?
Snuffleupagus!

83
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,770
I switched my specialty from
cardiology to plastic surgery,

84
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,689
got rid of the big honker,

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,286
and the ring became my thing.

86
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,686
I just assumed after we got married
she'd stop hooking, but...

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,490
You need to put this wedding
band on a true heart.

88
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,089
This is a good moment.

89
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,842
Yeah. Should we
go make it last,

90
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,121
for a while, somewhere?

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,210
Okay, let's go.
To your dorm.

92
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,041
Sometimes
I think about

93
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,645
throwing the ring
into the ocean.

94
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,240
I know how wrong it is-
But I can't-

95
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,445
it's my Precious.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,123
Besides, being
fake married

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,850
is the perfect way
to make sure

98
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,890
I never get my
heart broken again.

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,721
What are these?

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,127
Boobie bags.

101
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,449
The women, they stick them
in their flat chesties,

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,562
make them big.

103
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,562
These are not the boobie
bags that I ordered.

104
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,921
What is that?

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,650
It's like a syrup
dispenser at an IHOP.

106
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,807
I don't know
what that is.

107
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,566
Come on. These, they
don't feel like these.

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,401
No... Seriously?

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,767
I just trying to learn.

110
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,687
Listen, Dr. Maccabee would
never accept subpar boobs.

111
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,569
Would you please just
get me what I ordered

112
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,120
and tell Omar that I would like a
discount for the inconvenience?

113
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,282
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, Simon.

114
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,806
My 4:00 here?
Yeah.

115
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,366
Room one, Kirsten
Brant. Don't laugh.

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,161
Well, I, uh...
I had bad plastic surgery.

117
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,285
Should've known this
doctor was a quack.

118
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,328
His office was in,
like, a warehouse.

119
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,530
I see, I see.

120
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,687
Questions?

121
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,851
No, no. Just, please
help me, Doctor.

122
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,202
Absolutely.
It's usually easier

123
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,011
to do these things right
the first time, but...

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,961
What? You seem dubious.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,041
Hmm?

126
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,571
Oh, no, not at all.

127
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,483
I mean, I hear you're
the best, Dr. Maccabee.

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,404
I don't know about that,

129
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,326
but I think we can figure
something out here.

130
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,643
Relax, relax.

131
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,761
That's relaxed? Hmm.

132
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,731
Here, let me just pull
it down for a sec.

133
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,168
And I let go. Okay, shoots right
back up there.

134
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,049
I'm sorry.
Oh. Sorry about what?

135
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,804
Oh, my God!
it's just...

136
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,009
That just really went
right up there.

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,924
That was high.
You gotta watch that.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,002
It's gonna get
caught in your hair.

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,609
I don't know, maybe I should
just keep it like this.

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,171
It seems to make
other people happy.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,685
No. But, seriously, are you available
for my kid's birthday party?

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,405
That's too much.
I'm sorry!

143
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,521
Let me give you a hug.

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,489
That's what you need first.
We'll fix this.

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,846
Mmm.

146
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,330
Oh, God! Okay, I gotta...

147
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,925
I'm gonna excuse myself.
I'm sorry.

148
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,690
Ding-dong!

149
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,567
Eddie's here.
Hey. My cousin.

150
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,967
Oh.

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,371
Oh, my gosh.

152
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,483
Brows gone wild over here.

153
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,891
I'm actually digging it.

154
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,961
And what are you doing later?

155
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,007
om

156
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,442
Oh, sorry, I'm kind of seeing anybody else.
There you go.

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,165
Oh, browch.

158
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,446
My gosh.

159
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,006
Look, I don't know
who you're seeing,

160
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,366
but whoever they are,

161
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,485
they don't have what this guy's got
down there, you know what I mean?

162
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,800
All right, Eddie.

163
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,850
Yeah, it's a very good one.
I should know, I installed it.

164
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,485
On, you had
a penile enlargement?

165
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,807
Yes.

166
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,567
People really do that?
That is hilarious!

167
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,241
See you on the 28th,
Dr. Maccabee!

168
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,923
Dude, why are you telling
everybody about my surgery?

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,804
Am I hiding the
secrets around here?

170
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,325
You don't think Katherine
knows about this?

171
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,289
Katherine was in the
room when I did that.

172
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,930
She held the
magnifying glass.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,650
I did. And the tweezer.

174
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,086
Real nice.

175
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,730
Did you get a chance
to try it out yet?

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,844
Uh, yeah.
I've banged it up.

177
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,082
It's got a couple dents.
I'm not gonna lie.

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,121
Yeah.
You did?

179
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,006
Not from a human.

180
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,764
It's got...
From this doll I made.

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,246
Oh.

182
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,849
Hey, Adon. Yo, yo.

183
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,287
Danny! I am so happy
you could be here!

184
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,164
How are you, baby?
Did you bring any Botox?

185
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,567
I didn't bring the Botox.
I brought my cousin, Eddie.

186
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,250
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

187
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,646
Is this a Halloween party?

188
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,370
Are you kidding
me right now?

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,601
You got a little more
work done, huh?

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,729
Yeah, just a little bit,
just tweaking, tweaking.

191
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,325
Maintenance, maintenance.

192
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,568
I just wanna stay
in the game, Danny.

193
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,161
I don't wanna hit home runs,
just some singles. That's all.

194
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,971
You gotta stop,
though, I'm telling you.

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,565
Do you have any
feeling in your face?

196
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,603
Just in this one
spot right here.

197
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,526
And then from the eyebrows
down, dead, dead.

198
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,367
Is that a car alarm?

199
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,409
He's laughing, he's laughing.
Oh, okay.

200
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,806
I wanted to go to your
cousin Danny here,

201
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,405
but he refused
to do any work.

202
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,006
He didn't wanna put his
fingers in the pie. Ooh!

203
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,571
It was getting dangerous.
This amount...

204
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,244
You gotta slow it down.

205
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,169
Okay, see? That shouldn't
be happening right now.

206
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,049
Adon! Adon, Adon, Adon!

207
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,608
Ariel out open his knee.
It looks awful.

208
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,727
What happened?
Settle, settle.

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,046
What do you expect me
to do about it?

210
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,168
It's bleeding. You know what?
I could stitch him up.

211
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,964
Why don't you go get me my bag?
All right.

212
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,170
So, you fell down
the stairs, huh?

213
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,486
Yeah.

214
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,686
Mmm-hmm.

215
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,250
Did you trip
over something?

216
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,731
Was there a
skateboard there, or...

217
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,287
No, I was distracted
by something.

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,926
What distracted you?

219
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,166
A girl.

220
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,051
A girl, okay.
Was it your mother?

221
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,321
No!

222
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,686
'Cause she
just looks good.

223
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,127
That's your stepmom.
I can talk like that.

224
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,288
All right. This is lidocaine.
Don't think about it.

225
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,044
own

226
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,128
Don't think about it.
Think about your face.

227
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,326
Good, good.

228
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,886
Blonde, brunette, redhead?

229
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,844
Blonde, tan, tall,
rocking body.

230
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,241
Nipples.

231
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,364
Want me to numb
something else for you?

232
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,726
You're getting a little
nutty over there.

233
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,404
No! No,
I'm good. I'm good.

234
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,770
I'm alive!
I'm alive, everybody!

235
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,964
Good job, Doctor.
That was really nice.

236
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,003
The distraction,
I'm guessing.

237
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,127
The What?

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,891
The boy was distracted.
That's why he fell.

239
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,244
So, I'm taking
the rap for this.

240
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,966
Yes. Your hotness basically
pushed him down the stairs.

241
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,764
Good luck proving that
in court, Wisengruber.

242
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,570
Wisengruber? Is that
what they're saying

243
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,005
on the Gossip Girl nowadays?

244
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,371
I knew you two would
eventually find each other!

245
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,250
But be careful, Palmer,
these plastic surgeons,

246
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,601
they really know
how to operate.

247
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,886
Yeah, all right,
Adon. All right.

248
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,686
I just don't
know about plastic surgery.

249
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,410
I mean, doesn't it
always look so fake?

250
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,642
Depends who's doing it.
I'm pretty good at it. I'm telling you.

251
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,762
Some of my patients are here tonight.
Oh, really?

252
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,841
Really, really.
Look around,

253
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,367
see if you can find
someone decent-looking.

254
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,530
How 'bout her?

255
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,165
The lady from Saw?

256
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,690
Fine. Who did you do?

257
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,810
All right. I hate
to rat the guy out,

258
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,723
but see that
guy over there?

259
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,724
You mean Sexy Ass?

260
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,367
Before I met him,
he was No Buns Bobby.

261
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,521
Really?

262
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,768
His back went straight to his legs.
No kidding.

263
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,881
He'd go to
the bathroom,

264
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,041
he'd slide right
in the toilet.

265
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,646
I know, I know, that's
really romantic, isn't it?

266
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,291
So, North Carolina, how long
have you lived here in LA?

267
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,850
I've been here
almost two years.

268
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,321
Uh-huh. That's a lot
of auditioning for you.

269
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,961
You think I'm an actress?

270
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,371
I guarantee
you're an actress.

271
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,205
Well, guess again, Doc.
I teach sixth grade math.

272
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,524
They got no schools in
North Carolina to teach at?

273
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,005
My parents divorced.

274
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,445
Had a pretty nasty
one, actually,

275
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,130
when I was in the eighth grade.
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,564
And... I don't know. I got
tired of picking sides, so...

277
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,163
Okay. I thought I'd make a change
and, yeah, move out to LA.

278
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,001
You came to the right place.
No one gets divorced in LA.

279
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,320
Mmm-hmm.

280
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,047
I've never hung out with a girl your age.
This is nice.

281
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,286
Oh, no.
Your first lie to me.

282
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,688
You're good. All right.

283
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,049
I've never hung out with
a girl your age and

284
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,051
connected the way
we are right now.

285
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,367
Actually, I've never
connected with,

286
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,408
I don't think any
girl at any age.

287
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,444
See? I can tell
when you're lying

288
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,608
and when you're telling the truth.
Oh.

289
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,444
Yeah. The second thing
I said was the truth.

290
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,046
I know.

291
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,367
Oh, my God. That was the
greatest night of my life.

292
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,641
Yeah. This feels
like it could be...

293
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,083
I don't know, a real thing.

294
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,727
It's a thing all right,
Palmer.

295
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,684
Well, I have
to get to work,

296
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,046
but how 'bout
I take your number

297
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,449
and then you can take me out
on a proper date next time?

298
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,647
I got a business card in my
pocket if you wanna get that.

299
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,969
You better call.

300
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,208
You better not just,
just leave me hanging.

301
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,210
I'd get it for you myself,

302
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,362
but I don't want you to see
me naked in the daylight.

303
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,329
It could be a deal breaker.

304
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,686
What's this?

305
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,411
A circle?

306
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,246
A wedding ring?
You're married?

307
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,641
No, no, no, I'm not,
I'm not married.

308
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,925
That is a... That is...
That's not mine.

309
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,330
Whose wedding ring
is in your pants, Danny?

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,441
All right, listen, just give
me a minute to explain this.

311
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,846
Please.

312
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,171
It's gonna take
more than a minute.

313
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,685
I am such an idiot!

314
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,921
No, no, no, no, no.

315
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,889
Don't call me!

316
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,610
No, Palmer!

317
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,891
I told you that this whole
fake marriage thing

318
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,883
was just gonna come
and bite you in the ass.

319
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,769
Why don't you just
tell her the truth?

320
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,689
You think I can
tell her the truth?

321
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,283
Let me practice.
You be her right now.

322
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,164
Oh, good.
Okay, hold on.

323
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,561
Okay. She's not like
that, but anyways.

324
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,565
Um, I wear this fake
wedding ring sometimes...

325
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,687
You're a pig.

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,685
Sorry. You're a pig.

327
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,802
What's wrong? You're
walking really weird.

328
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,088
My back. I slept on
the beach last night.

329
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,326
God Almighty.

330
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,243
When are you gonna
strengthen your spine?

331
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,091
Seriously, Flomax.

332
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,049
You gotta work out
more than once a month.

333
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,645
I can't, I don't
have time to work out.

334
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,290
You do. You can't
say that, Danny.

335
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,483
My mother always said Cary
Grant never went to the gym.

336
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,524
Only took the stairs,
every day, never an elevator.

337
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,166
You wanna hear my impression of
Cary Grant's butler? Nuh-uh.

338
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,287
Watch.
What?

339
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,681
Hello?
No, he's dead.

340
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,444
Okay, bye-bye.

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,206
That's good.
That's funny.

342
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,566
Mom, give me some money.

343
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,043
Hi. How are you?

344
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,326
Nice to see you, kids.

345
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,442
Please be polite and say
hello to Dr. Maccabee.

346
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,920
'Ello, Dr. Danny.

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,445
'Ow is you today?

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,285
Is that my associate,
Dr. Doolittle?

349
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,566
Why is she
talking like that?

350
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,728
She's been working
on some accents.

351
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,963
I am takin' an acting
class this summer, I is.

352
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,686
Gonna be the next
Miley Cyrus, I am.

353
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,286
How 'bout you, young man?
Do you like Hannah Montana?

354
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,289
No. I like
Californication.

355
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,165
When do you ever
watch Californication?

356
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,284
Rosa lets us watch Showtime
when she calls her boyfriend.

357
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,490
Eat the mushroom!
Eat the mushroom! Yes!

358
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,208
Mmm. You run a tight
ship at home, huh?

359
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,521
Dr. Danny?

360
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,887
Yeah?

361
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,725
Will you take me to Hawaii so
I can swim with the dolphins?

362
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,321
Take you to Hawaii? No.

363
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,007
I saw a show on
the Discovery Channel.

364
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,049
They say in Hawaii
they have dolphins

365
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,770
that you can swim
with if you pay money.

366
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,087
Okay.

367
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,965
But I don't have any money.
And my mom says you're rich.

368
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,969
Michael!
No, it's fine.

369
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,168
Maybe you should
make your own money.

370
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,368
Maybe a paper route
or something like that?

371
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,121
'Cause rich people don't
give other people trips.

372
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,242
That's why they remain
rich. You understand?

373
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,842
But my mom says you do charity
for kids all the time.

374
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,291
I do charity work like I fix a
cleft lip or a child's deformity.

375
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,404
I don't take them to Hawaii.
I could get arrested for that.

376
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,849
What if I was deformed?
Then would you take me to Hawaii?

377
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,368
If you were deformed,
I'd bring you to Hawaii,

378
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,051
but I'd leave you there, 'cause
I wouldn't want to look at you.

379
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,969
Okay. Here's the money,
and I want change.

380
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,201
And I wanna hear back

381
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,402
that you actually ate the
food that I am paying for.

382
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,805
Mom, before we go,
can I make a Devlin?

383
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,526
Sure. Down the hall.
Will you please go with him?

384
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,365
We open in five minutes and I am
not having him sit there forever.

385
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,442
Bloody hell right,
I will, Mumsy!

386
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,682
All right,
Winston Churchill.

387
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,131
He said, "I gotta
make a Devlin."

388
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,043
What does that mean?
Uh...

389
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,761
It's just a friend of mine who
was in my sorority in college

390
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,241
named Devlin Adams, and...

391
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,648
Well, I wouldn't say friend.
I'd say more my nemesis.

392
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,882
Oh, so she was a frenemy?
Yes.

393
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,721
You'd probably like her.
She's really, really fake.

394
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,847
Ah.

395
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,729
Always had to have
the coolest clothes

396
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,451
and the hottest boys
and, you know...

397
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,642
She bothers you.
A lot.

398
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,405
So, one night, I was just
having a glass of wine.

399
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,323
A bottle.
A bottle.

400
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,606
And, uh...

401
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,845
And I just got so tired of
the kids saying things like,

402
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,285
"l gotta take a crap.

403
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,811
"l gotta take a dump."

404
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,123
So, I told them that it was
called "making a Devlin,"

405
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,565
and they liked it.

406
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,687
And it stuck.

407
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,164
I always call it making
a black pickle.

408
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,004
Making a what?
I don't say that.

409
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,963
Out loud? Good.
To others. No.

410
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,970
What are we gonna do
about my love life, though?

411
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,209
Oh, Danny, I would feel
terrible for you if I had any,

412
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,562
even the slightest,
investment in you

413
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,085
successfully banging
23-year-olds.

414
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,807
Holy Devlin, you're
not listening to me.

415
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,328
This is like not
some bull-Devlin fling.

416
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,010
I mean, I'm serious.

417
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,650
This is the real Devlin.
I could...

418
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,961
I swear to God, I could see
myself ending up with this girl.

419
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,441
Oh.

420
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,530
You're right. You can't
tell her the truth.

421
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,801
High score!

422
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,769
Oh, God. Sorry.

423
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,886
I'm glad someone's
doing good.

424
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,208
You know what?
You don't wanna get serious,

425
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,487
'cause when you get serious,
that leads to marriage,

426
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
and then marriage leads to
divorce, and divorce is just...

427
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,281
I mean, look at
these poor kids.

428
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,922
You know, their dad was
supposed to pick them up today.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,365
He was a no-show?
Again.

430
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,766
But you know what?

431
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,320
At least I got my head
together and I divorced him.

432
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,766
Yeah, yeah.

433
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,446
Wait a minute.

434
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,806
You go ahead without me.

435
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,207
Oh, no, no, no.

436
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,691
Palmer, Palmer, Palmer,
Palmer, Palmer.

437
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,285
I told you I didn't
want to see you.

438
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,090
I just want to explain
something to you.

439
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,402
Let me explain
something to you.

440
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,769
I do not date
married men.

441
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,610
My father cheated on my mom
when I was young.

442
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,489
I am not going to be
the other woman!

443
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,523
Adulterer! Fornicator!

444
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,842
All right, take it easy,
Damien, all right?

445
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,763
Okay, his name is Silas,
leave him out of this.

446
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,248
I'll kill you.

447
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,363
What? Anytime!

448
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,283
Listen! I am married.

449
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,728
But it is a
horrible marriage.

450
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,564
She doesn't even
talk to me anymore.

451
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,290
Danny, that's what
all married men say.

452
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,489
If it's so bad, why don't
you get divorced?

453
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,881
I am.

454
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,041
You are?
Yes! It's over.

455
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,885
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this.

456
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,405
I destroyed a marriage!

457
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,682
I really feel like I'm gonna
be sick. I can't...

458
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,728
No, no, it wasn't
'cause of you!

459
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,848
I filed along,
long time ago.

460
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,289
We're gonna sign the papers
in a couple of days

461
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,442
and it's like,
she's dead to me.

462
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,846
What's her name?

463
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,366
Mrs. Maccabee.

464
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,690
You mean her first name?
Her first name is Devlin.

465
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,931
Her name's Devlin?

466
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,845
Isn't that a shitty name?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,801
But Devlin and I are
splitting up, fortunately,

468
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,204
'cause I caught her cheating
on me with another guy.

469
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,446
I didn't catch her.

470
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,605
The television show Cheaters
caught her and the guy.

471
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,925
And I told them
not to air it, though,

472
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,207
because it's too painful.

473
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,521
They actually burned the tape
so you can't see it.

474
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,250
But I would love you to.

475
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,284
There's another man?

476
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,245
There's another guy,
yes. Dolph.

477
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,886
Dolph?

478
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,804
Dolph Lundgren. Yeah.

479
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,445
Like the guy from Rocky IV?

480
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,171
No, no, a different
Dolph Lundgren.

481
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,602
Apparently, if you
bring that one up,

482
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,126
this one gets really
angry, so don't.

483
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,203
Danny, guys always say they're
gonna leave their wives.

484
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,361
They never do.

485
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,608
I'm telling you, she's
happy with this Dolph guy,

486
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,842
good for her.
Now I wanna be happy.

487
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,161
And the only way I can be
happy is if I'm with you!

488
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,361
All right?

489
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,764
Just wanna be able
to be with you

490
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,649
and not be called
a "fornicator"

491
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,404
or an "adulterer"
or whatever that

492
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,244
Children of the Corn kid
was calling me.

493
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,001
Okay.

494
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,161
Okay?

495
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,164
I just need to hear
it from her.

496
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,561
How about if she texts you,
would that be good?

497
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,041
I need to meet her.

498
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,001
Let's do it.

499
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,807
You want me to be your wife?
Uh-huh.

500
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,928
And you couldn't think of another
name, other than Devlin?

501
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,606
I practically took a Devlin in
my pants when she asked me.

502
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,806
"What's her name?"
I got panicked.

503
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,927
I get nervous
around this girl.

504
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,126
You got panicked?

505
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,407
You who invents a fake
wife every Friday night?

506
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,641
Yeah. Doesn't that
say something

507
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,960
about what I feel
about this girl?

508
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,201
Have you ever thought
about the time

509
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,209
that she's actually gonna walk
into your office... Uh-huh.

510
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,330
...and sees that I'm
your assistant/receptionist?

511
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,164
So easy. I'm a
plastic surgeon,

512
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,605
you will never look
like you again.

513
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,643
Snip, snap. Chip, chap.
What are you talking about?

514
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,324
I'm kidding. I'll get you
a fake mustache.

515
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,370
Oh, my God, you've really,
really not thought this through.

516
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,330
Will you please just
look at some clothes?

517
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,164
Look at that.
I don't wear...

518
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,605
I have clothes,
by the way.

519
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,051
I do not need to do
any of this. I'm fine.

520
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,924
Yes. You have the best
clothes that Old Navy sells.

521
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,008
I'm just saying you gotta look
like a plastic surgeon's wife.

522
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,521
I want to create the illusion
I had a hot first wife.

523
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,965
You're so...
Not this!

524
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,690
Okay, come on,
let's go, you asked for it.

525
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,807
I'm ready.

526
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,282
Wow! These are...
Oh, geez.

527
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,407
Nice, nice.

528
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,529
It's just been a while since
I've been in heels, sorry.

529
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,648
Okay, okay.
Oh, gosh. Okay.

530
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,529
Get there.
Yeah, great.

531
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,047
Oh, my God!
These are gorgeous!

532
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,368
How much are these?
$1,700.

533
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,120
$1,700? What, do you
come with them?

534
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,323
My parents' house
costs $1,700. No, no.

535
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,164
No. What, did Mickey
Mantle sign those?

536
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,368
Why are they $1,700,
they made outta panda?

537
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,851
Walk away.
Yeah. You know what?

538
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,729
We won't really be
needing them anyway.

539
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,689
'Cause I'm actually
starting to...

540
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,322
I'm actually starting to feel not so hot.
ls it warm in here?

541
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,761
Whoo. I'm not sure I'll be
able to make it this evening.

542
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,483
Very good. Okay, you know what?
We'll take them.

543
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,762
It's your Christmas bonus.
Oh, really?

544
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,604
Okay, then I would like
them in blue, too.

545
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,365
In case a heel breaks
or I just want to cuddle.

546
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,409
It's beautiful.
You sicken me.

547
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,449
Yes, well, that's why
we're getting a divorce.

548
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,683
We're getting a divorce because
you're greedy, schemy and selfish.

549
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,085
Actually, I think you need
to get the matching bag, too.

550
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,049
Yeah, I think
I should.

551
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,964
Mmm. Thank you, Laurie. I agree.

552
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,884
All the girls are sticking
together. Isn't that sweet?

553
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,604
Mmm-hmm.
She's on your side, what a shock.

554
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,370
You asked for this.
Trust me.

555
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,681
Uh-huh. You asked for this.

556
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,367
No.

557
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,207
No.

558
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,047
Hell, no!
No,no,no!

559
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,246
What do you mean, no?

560
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,811
No? No what?

561
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,089
No hope. Okay?
There's only one word for it.

562
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,481
What is it?
Neglect.

563
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,571
Okay? This is
the one word

564
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,005
for the whole thing.
Are you the husband?

565
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,441
I'm the soon
to be ex-husband.

566
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,761
We're getting a divorce.

567
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,206
Well, you know he's
not divorcing you.

568
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,441
He's divorcing your head.

569
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,443
True 'dat, Ernesto.
Right on the money.

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,011
Your hair is so messed up,
I don't even...

571
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,127
Let me count the ways.

572
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,250
It's dull, it's dead,
it's flat.

573
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,521
Don't forget smelly.

574
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,011
It don't smell,
particularly...

575
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,525
Okay, I think we got it.
You bad.

576
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,921
You is bad. Give me a little bit.
That's bad, though.

577
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,050
You guys, come on, seriously.
Ernesto, can you just, please

578
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,804
do something,
so we can be home

579
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,881
and I can get out of here?

580
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,008
Hurricane Katrina could
do something, baby.

581
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,366
I'm gonna do something
transcendent.

582
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,642
Katya! Yuri,
Mrs. Hwiggins!

583
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,926
We going in deep, y'all.

584
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,370
You seem nervous, Danny.

585
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,646
No, no, I just...

586
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,563
It's weird, she
gets me very tense.

587
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,165
I'm sorry to put
you through this.

588
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,731
No, I understand
why we're doing this.

589
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,842
I'm just looking forward to
getting past this part of my life

590
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,729
and moving on
to the good part.

591
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,327
We will. Soon. Tonight.

592
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,811
Good God, yes.

593
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,843
Is that her?

594
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,851
I think so.

595
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,405
She's stunning.

596
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,083
I love her shoes.

597
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,487
Yeah, well, she got
about five pairs of them.

598
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,721
Maybe she'll
give you one.

599
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,605
Henderson!

600
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,887
Do you see Dr. Maccabee
anywhere in this...

601
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,170
Oh! There he is.

602
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,890
Keep the car running,
shan't be long.

603
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,086
Hello, boring!

604
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,890
Hey. You went
with a limo driver?

605
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,565
I'm just playing the part.

606
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,046
Okay.

607
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,801
Palmer! Hi.

608
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,651
Devlin Maccabee.
Soon to be, single-abee.

609
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,489
Waiter! Excuse me. Anybody?

610
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,881
Yes, yes. Something
to drink, madam?

611
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,366
Well, hello.

612
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,442
I would like
a tall glass of you.

613
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,488
Is that possible? Meow!

614
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,131
I'm just kidding.
Unless you're really into it.

615
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,522
Kidding again. No, I'm not.

616
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,844
We don't know.
Grey Goose martinis,

617
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,287
just keep 'em
coming. Okay. Ooh!

618
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,246
Make that a dirty
martini. Okay?

619
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,481
Okay, that was
a good one.

620
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,211
Well, so, Palmer.

621
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,691
I heard you and
Danny had sex.

622
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,326
Yes. I am so sorry, I had...

623
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,960
Please, honey,
it is fine.

624
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,687
I'm just happy to hear that his
thing-a-ding can still ring-a-ding.

625
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,162
'Cause he's got
a serious small issue

626
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,049
with ED. Over here.

627
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,281
Okay.

628
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,805
What's ED? I don't...

629
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,008
Oh, gosh. I forgot.
You're fifteen.

630
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,162
Erectile dysfunction,
my darling.

631
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,567
Think about it as if

632
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,405
you're trying to throw darts
and you just...

633
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,403
All you really got,
you're shooting with,

634
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,970
like, overcooked spaghetti.

635
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,206
Okay. Yeah.

636
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,841
I just think that my
spaghetti wasn't loving

637
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,490
the meatballs that
was being served.

638
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,251
They were a little too lumpy.
Oh.

639
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,928
I've heard from a lot
of men that I serve

640
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,083
the finest meatballs
in Southern California.

641
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,205
Of course. A lot of homeless
men have said this.

642
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,761
They'll eat anything, you know.

643
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,162
I'm just very shocked
that you remember

644
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,890
anybody you've
ever been with.

645
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,247
With all the pills
that are in your system.

646
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,251
She likes the
pills, this one.

647
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,970
At night I come home,
"What's for dinner?"

648
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,562
"Well, we have purple pills,
and the green ones

649
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,211
"and some lovely
yellow bombers

650
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,044
"I just took out
of the oven."

651
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,286
Remember that?

652
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,961
I had to do something
to amuse myself

653
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,362
while this one sat on
the throne for hours

654
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,568
dealing with his irritable
bowel syndrome.

655
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,649
I got another disease. Okay.

656
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,566
Can I tell you, I spent
the eve of our wedding

657
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,051
sitting on the bed,

658
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,762
listening to what sounded like
an underwater symphony,

659
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,969
of French horns
and bassoons

660
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,769
coming out of our
hotel bathroom.

661
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,806
Mix that with the smell of like
a dead cat and some fajitas

662
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,008
and you've got what
you call yourself

663
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,044
a severely diminished libido.

664
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,491
OW!

665
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,970
Did you just kick me?

666
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,248
No. Did you?
You kicked her?

667
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,367
Why'd you kick her?

668
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,969
Yeah, I don't... I... Yes.
I... I have leg spasms.

669
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,165
OW!

670
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,407
It's a side effect.

671
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,323
Terrible side effect from
all the pill popping.

672
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,402
But, you know,
it's all better now.

673
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,562
I'm clean and sober
and I apologize.

674
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,721
It's okay.

675
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,770
Thirteenth step, right there.
Back to drinking.

676
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,369
Oh, Henderson,
you thoughtless oaf,

677
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,851
stop texting,
open that door.

678
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,328
Why do you keep calling me Henderson?
Just go with it.

679
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,881
Palmer, so lovely
to meet you.

680
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,890
Likewise, really.

681
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,765
I mean,
look at you two.

682
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,724
I mean, it's like,
Barbie and...

683
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,847
Yes.

684
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,730
...Grandpa Ken.

685
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,489
I mean... And even though
it did not work out

686
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,291
between us at all...

687
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,763
it's like it never
happened. You know?

688
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,001
It really isn't.

689
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,487
I still want my Danny to be happy.
Oh, look at that.

690
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,766
Happy, happy, happy.

691
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,001
Good night, kiddo.
Okay.

692
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,480
Hello.

693
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,924
It's her drug dealer
I'm thinking.

694
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,850
Okay, please put her
on the phone right now.

695
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,840
Are you kidding me, honey?

696
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,570
You know how I feel about

697
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,564
you selling your
brother's stuff on eBay.

698
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,650
Hey, hey, hey.
Take that in the car.

699
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,846
No. It's okay.

700
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,687
I will deal with you when I
get home, young lady. Okay.

701
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,128
I mean,
you would think...

702
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,610
You have kids?

703
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,924
Hmm?Hmm?

704
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,010
You have...
You have children?

705
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,371
We have sort
of a little bit...

706
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,488
A little bit of
children, right?

707
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,085
When were you
planning on telling me

708
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,286
about these
children, Danny?

709
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,646
I don't know,
but listen,

710
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,963
I have to go get to
those little munchkins.

711
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,048
Palmer, so nice,
seriously.

712
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,167
Danny.

713
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,809
No, no, no, hey, hey.

714
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,411
Okay.

715
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,402
Are you freaked out right
now about all this or...

716
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,811
Actually,
just the opposite.

717
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,811
The opposite of freaked out?
What do you mean? Good?

718
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,211
You know
that I love kids.

719
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,361
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,442
I just never pegged
you as a kids guy.

721
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,240
I'm a huge kids guy.
I love kids.

722
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,004
Kids, kids, kids. Is...

723
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,242
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my thing.
That's my bumper sticker.

724
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,526
What are their names?

725
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,687
What are their names
again? There is

726
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,524
the girl who, of
course, is Kiki Dee.

727
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,168
And then the
boy's name's Bart.

728
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,689
Which of course
is short for Barto.

729
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,171
Well, I wanna meet them!

730
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,001
Of course you do.

731
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,450
So our mom doesn't
know that you took us today?

732
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,726
Not yet.

733
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,450
You know this
is kidnapping.

734
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,681
Stranger danger.

735
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,091
What? No.

736
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,766
Is the guy from Dateline NBC
gonna walk in?

737
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,243
No! I know you two a long
time and Rosa's here.

738
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,489
Doing whatever
that Rosa does.

739
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,844
God, she's freaky.
Yeah.

740
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,007
So here's the deal.

741
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,927
How would you like to
be my pretend children

742
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,331
for one afternoon?

743
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,402
Why don't you just tell
that poor girl the truth?

744
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,601
You know?

745
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,284
Our mother tells
us everything.

746
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,771
Wedding ring boy.

747
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,001
What?
Oh, my goodness!

748
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,004
Did you see Gossip Girl
last night? It was so good!

749
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,923
No, she's not
like that.

750
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,287
Your mother's presenting her
in a weird, weird way.

751
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,441
I'm just saying,
telling the truth

752
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,010
is not in the
cards right now.

753
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,521
I thought you'd be excited
to have an acting job.

754
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,847
If it's an acting job,
we should get paid.

755
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,366
Yeah, you're gonna get
paid in experience.

756
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,289
I wanna actually get paid.

757
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,766
All right,
what do you want?

758
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,803
$600 for the day,

759
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,281
plus overtime if we
go over eight hours.

760
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,885
I'll do my own
hair and makeup.

761
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,970
And I want you to pay for the
six-week intensive acting camp

762
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,371
that my mom can't afford.

763
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,370
$50 for the day and a two-week acting
class at the YMCA nearest you.

764
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,002
$500 and a four-
week acting class.

765
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,521
$300 and a three-week class.

766
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,887
Done.

767
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,322
I would have
done it for $500.

768
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,408
I would have done
it for the experience.

769
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,481
Michael, you're up.
Opener?

770
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,324
I want you to take
me to Hawaii

771
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,402
so I can swim
with the dolphins.

772
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,244
You're not gonna
let that one go, are you?

773
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,482
We're not going to Hawaii, pal.
Anything else?

774
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,562
Find someone else then.

775
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,606
Ooh, the Mafia stare down.
Very good, Michael.

776
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,000
We're here to negotiate.

777
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,923
Do you have anything
else you might like?

778
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,931
I want a flying pony.

779
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,526
I want a flying pony too,
Michael, but they don't exist.

780
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,249
Then I want a regular pony.
And I want to name him Nelson.

781
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,365
How about a Playstation 3
and we name him Nelson?

782
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,281
Keep talking.

783
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,363
We'll include
four video games.

784
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,521
Five games.

785
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,286
And I want the meeting with blondie
to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

786
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,526
How 'bout
Charlie Choo-Choo's

787
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,761
'cause it's right down
the street from me.

788
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,680
Mention that slop-hole
again and I walk.

789
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,206
All right, take it easy, son.
Take it easy.

790
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,488
And I want
unlimited tokens.

791
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,040
If I can spend 'em,
I wanna have 'em.

792
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,849
I don't wanna be
like playing Skee-Ball

793
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,649
and all of a sudden
run out of tokens.

794
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,328
All right, I can
make that happen.

795
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,970
So do we have a deal?

796
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,127
Deal.

797
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,807
Deal's off unless you eat
that pizza, though. Seriously.

798
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,645
Can I do an accent?

799
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,324
Let me hear some.
'Ello!

800
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,890
No.
Okay.

801
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,886
My kids? Have you
completely lost your mind?

802
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,724
Are you kidding
me right now?

803
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,484
You're the one who picked
up your cell phone.

804
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,001
That is not...

805
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,320
Mrs. Harrington...

806
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,404
The doctor will
see you now.

807
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,320
I can't believe you're doing all
of this just so you can get some.

808
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,164
It's just gross.
You're just pathetic.

809
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,561
I'm not trying to get some.
I already got some.

810
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,489
And yes, I'd like to
continue getting some.

811
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,090
I'm pro me getting some.

812
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,400
Have a seat right
there, Mrs. Harrington.

813
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,164
Remove your shirt,
if you could.

814
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,800
I smell something.
You smell something?

815
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,245
I smell perfume.

816
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,286
Is that coming from you?

817
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,441
Maybe.

818
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,291
What, you got a
date or something?

819
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,171
I don't have a date.
I have a lunch.

820
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,442
You got a lunch?
Who you got a lunch with?

821
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,851
Dr. Gervitz's office manager,
if you must know everything.

822
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,007
His name is Brian.

823
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,884
The guy with the
gray soul patch?

824
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,280
You know what?

825
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,805
Hey, man, I'm Brian.

826
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,881
You're mean!

827
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,200
Wow, you wanna go
to lunch sometime?

828
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,362
Is he gonna take you there
right after the big protest?

829
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,807
Hey, man, we gotta
stop these squirrels.

830
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,690
He plays bass, don't he?

831
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,691
You can take the
brassiere off, too.

832
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,088
And by the way,
he does play the bass.

833
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,003
And he writes songs.

834
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,321
What does he
write songs about,

835
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,640
how bad his
ponytail stinks?

836
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,485
Mrs. Harrington, could you put
your hands on your hips, please?

837
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,484
Okay, so, one of the funbags
is not having too much fun.

838
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,045
All right, what
happened anyways?

839
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,890
Well, I hit it with the car
door yesterday... Right.

840
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,041
...and I heard a pop

841
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,249
and then some sloshing
sound when I walk.

842
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,687
Yeah. I think.

843
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,561
What are you doing?

844
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,491
Could be the kids
or could be Brian.

845
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,846
Okay. Stop that.

846
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,001
Do you mind just
for one second?

847
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,161
Let me just talk
to this guy.

848
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,766
Stop!

849
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,240
Yeah.

850
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,603
Hello?
Yeah, man!

851
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,605
Brian?
You can lie down.

852
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,251
Yeah, hi!
We sure are.

853
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,001
Yeah, no, sushi
would be groovy.

854
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,684
Okay, I'll see you
at 1:00 in the lobby.

855
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,285
Okay, bye.

856
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,851
What voice was that?

857
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,287
That was my voice.

858
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,726
Really?

859
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,804
I didn't sound like that.

860
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,126
One o'clock...

861
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,363
You're excited
about this guy, huh?

862
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,291
Mrs. Harrington, this is numbing
cream for your nipples, okay?

863
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,561
Oh. Oh, okay.

864
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,291
It's gonna be
one afternoon.

865
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,805
Why are we making such
a big deal out of this?

866
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,042
Because you know what?
You're trying to get my kids involved

867
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,489
in your dysfunctional, sick little,
pathetic, twisted web of lies.

868
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,210
When I was negotiating
with your son, Michael,

869
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,250
he had the biggest smile I've
ever seen on anyone's face.

870
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,047
When I told him we could
do it at J.D. McFunnigan's,

871
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,485
the kid looked like he
won the Heisman Trophy,

872
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,050
I'm not kidding you.

873
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,651
I think that's enough.
Do you feel that?

874
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,807
No.

875
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,927
No, but do you feel that?

876
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,129
No.
We're good.

877
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,288
By the way,
did you make this?

878
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,486
Mmm-hmm.

879
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,324
We'll have to give it
to the Smithsonian

880
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,482
when we've clone the
operation. Terrific job.

881
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,320
Did he really smile?

882
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,323
Swear to God, like
the cutest little smile.

883
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,804
And I got Maggie to eat.

884
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,641
You did?
Yeah.

885
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,764
Pizza. Deep dish.
Three pieces.

886
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,411
I can't get her
to eat anything.

887
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,324
I know you can't.
Don't do this for me.

888
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,005
Do it for the children.

889
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,525
Yeah!
Oh, stop!

890
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,011
Come on, you're late!

891
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,525
What are you,
in character right away?

892
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,846
Come on, let's go!

893
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,690
She's inside.

894
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,961
What is that?

895
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,521
What?

896
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,365
Did Victoria Beckham have a yard sale?
Why are you wearing that?

897
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,841
Are you kidding me?

898
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,285
This is what
you bought for me.

899
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,964
I know, I know.
I'm just saying is it...

900
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,121
All right,
we're stuck with it,

901
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,361
I just think it's a little
over the top, but...

902
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,369
Thanks. Happy to be
here to help you.

903
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,331
The first rule of improv is
always accept the information.

904
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,323
If someone says something,
just go with it.

905
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,526
No negating.

906
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,450
Gotcha. That sounds
good, that's smart.

907
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,046
In my acting class, when
someone says "No" in a scene,

908
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,565
the whole class
yells, "Die!"

909
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,529
No. I mean, no one
will say "no" then.

910
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,726
Don't yell "die."

911
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,166
Who's up for some
warm-up exercises?

912
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,123
No, honey, I'm not gonna do that.
The what?

913
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,523
The tip of the tongue,
the teeth, the lips.

914
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,485
I got one for you.
Shut up!

915
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,086
All right, let's go already.
Are you ready there, Mafia?

916
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,084
Hell, yeah.
Let's do it!

917
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,125
Stinks.

918
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,162
Smells like Kids' feet and
like skidmark underwear.

919
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,129
Mmm. Happy Father's Day.

920
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,881
Oh! Jeez!

921
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,286
Mommy! That man put
his pee-pee on my face!

922
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,601
What?

923
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,882
He put his face on my pee-pee.
Danny!

924
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,122
I'm saying he's the one.
I don't think it matters.

925
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,406
No, I get you.

926
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,324
Oh, oh! Palmer, darling.

927
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,561
Hi.

928
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,804
Devlin. Thank you so much
for bringing the kids today.

929
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,723
I don't think she was the
only one who brought them.

930
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,327
You know what I'm saying?
They are my pride and joy.

931
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,490
So I'd like to introduce
you to, the one and only,

932
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,406
Kiki Dee, who came out
at nine pounds four ounces.

933
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,561
Yeouch.

934
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,643
And then the whopper,
we call him, Bart,

935
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,644
because he was a 12-pounder
and did some damage.

936
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,325
Okay. So...

937
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,480
Hi, you guys.

938
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,806
Hello, Palmer.

939
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,405
Heard so much about you.

940
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,526
You're British?

941
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,287
So you're the bird what's been given
Daddy the ol' slap and tickle?

942
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,370
We sent her to boarding school
last year in England.

943
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,207
See? So she picked
up a slight accent.

944
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,328
It's, you know, very Madonna.

945
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,921
Well, it is a pleasure
meeting you, Kiki Dee.

946
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,044
Wish I could say the same.

947
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,522
You see, before you,
I had meself a father.

948
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,524
I was the apple of his eye.

949
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,166
It was all giggling
and chasing butterflies

950
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,049
in the meadows,
and what have you.

951
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,886
And now what do I got?

952
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,843
An hour and a half
every other week

953
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,369
at J.D. McFunnigan's
with him and his whore.

954
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,645
Koko! Kiki!
Kiki!

955
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,403
God, she's in such pain.

956
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,164
No, that's the pills that...

957
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,480
She took some out
of her mother's bureau.

958
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,641
Are you...

959
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,325
All right, let me
go see her.

960
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,964
How are you doing, sweetie?

961
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,408
I'll be better when I
start seeing some tokens.

962
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,971
He's American.

963
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,404
Excuse me. Yo!
What was that all about?

964
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,484
That was raw and real
and in the moment.

965
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,925
You know, I feel
very good about it.

966
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,644
You do?
Well, I don't!

967
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,405
So if you wanna get your money
and your acting classes,

968
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,330
you better start doing
things right from now on.

969
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,845
No more sob stories.

970
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,161
And we're stuck with the
English accent now, Ringo,

971
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,163
so commit to it.
Don't choke, got it?

972
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,321
Got it.

973
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,448
Now hug me
and laugh

974
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,329
and let's get back
into the show.

975
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,091
Okay. Papa!

976
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,841
You're not a
whore, Palmer.

977
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,001
Okay.

978
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,844
That's so nice. See
what they do, they fight,

979
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,206
then they make
up and it's good.

980
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,600
Good.
We're doing good.

981
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,451
Are you kidding me?

982
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,686
Got a hamburger here for Bart,
Art the Water Fart.

983
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,807
Here you go, kid.

984
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,126
Look at that, sweet!

985
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,609
And two quesadillas for Kiki
Sneaky With a Side of Freaky.

986
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,928
Here's the waters.
No soda for you.

987
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,606
You're battling diabetes, remember?
Huh?

988
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,971
Kiki Dee?

989
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,920
I got you two quesadillas 'cause it's
your favorite food so you have to eat it.

990
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,648
Well, yes! And that's why I'm going
to eat every single bit of it.

991
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,564
All right,
let's see.

992
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,446
Yummy!

993
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,647
Thank you.

994
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,644
Hey, I think we
forgot napkins.

995
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,809
We did? Okay. Well let
me get the napkins.

996
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,484
Because I know she's
not gonna get up and do it

997
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,085
because she doesn't like
to get up and do anything.

998
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,321
Oh, nice.

999
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,005
Everybody be cool.

1000
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,644
So, Bart, your dad tells me you
like to go to the bathroom.

1001
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,687
When I feel it, I do it.

1002
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,164
What else do you like?

1003
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,765
I don't know.

1004
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,401
That's our Bart.

1005
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,522
He's a man of
very few words.

1006
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,565
Ah. Okay.

1007
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,685
Maybe I'm upset.

1008
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,364
Upset about me
and your father dating?

1009
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,082
No. You seem to make my dad
happy and that's cool, but...

1010
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,001
But What?

1011
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,441
Nothing.

1012
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,601
Hey, I want you
to feel comfortable

1013
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,841
telling me anything.

1014
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,286
Well, I just hate that he
broke his promise to me.

1015
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,521
What promise?

1016
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,886
Yeah, what promise?

1017
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,884
He promised me last year that
he would take me to Hawaii

1018
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,047
to swim with the dolphins.

1019
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,488
They have this lagoon
there with dolphins

1020
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,005
and people get
to swim with them.

1021
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,121
What are you doing?

1022
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,965
But without warning,
my dad canceled the trip.

1023
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,725
Why would he do that?

1024
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,804
He met you.

1025
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,281
He What?

1026
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,289
No!
Die!

1027
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,484
No,no,no,no,no,no!
I'm saying that did not...

1028
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,848
You misread what I said.

1029
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,844
I said we have to go
to Hawaii earlier.

1030
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,164
Because I'm excited for all
of us to hang out there.

1031
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,321
We're going to Hawaii!

1032
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,163
I can't believe I let a
six-year-old blackmail me.

1033
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,563
I saw my shot
and I took it.

1034
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,921
You're angry at yourself

1035
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,570
'cause you got us
into this whole situation.

1036
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,920
I did?
You really did.

1037
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,764
I think old Mary
Poppins with the,

1038
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,411
"You can't say no.
You can't say no, Guv'nor."

1039
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,329
Okay, listen,
my tolerance

1040
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,602
for these continued
shenanigans is right here.

1041
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,047
And if it gets up to here,
I'm taking my kids,

1042
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,009
I'm selling you out
and I'm going home.

1043
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,762
I am so happy we are
doing this, Danny.

1044
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,444
Are you kidding me?
We're going to Hawaii,

1045
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,124
we're gonna swim
with dolphins.

1046
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,850
It's gonna be so much fun.
I was just telling the squirt.

1047
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,445
And Seventeen magazine.

1048
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,204
You brought that for these
guys or is that for you?

1049
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,850
It's mine. it's my favorite.

1050
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,724
See that? Did you
ever read that magazine?

1051
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,040
Thirty years ago you did.

1052
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,803
And hopefully we're gonna have
time together, right, sweetie?

1053
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,689
Wait! Wait!

1054
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,284
Danny, wait!

1055
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:13,406
Muffinstein, I could not
stand to be without you.

1056
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,726
Uh-oh!

1057
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,847
IS this him?

1058
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,491
I see the Colonel von Generous
right here in front of me.

1059
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,130
Okay, I'm confused
right now.

1060
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,403
I'm so sorry. I've
not introduced myself,

1061
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,962
we have talked on the phone,
but I am the Dolph Lundgren.

1062
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,482
Devlin's man-friend/
love monkey.

1063
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,721
Oh, kill me now.

1064
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,723
Devlin said you had
to stay back and work.

1065
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,325
I did.
She what said?

1066
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,801
Nein, nein to the work.

1067
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,649
I will work
when I am kaput.

1068
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,330
You know, I think
this is so great

1069
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,925
of all of you, so mature.

1070
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,002
I would have loved if my parents
had done something like this

1071
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,491
when they got divorced.

1072
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,801
That's why I was thinking
we should have the man come.

1073
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,484
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad.

1074
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,489
It's important
for the children

1075
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,682
to see us as a unit.

1076
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,723
And also I cannot stay away
from this potato pancake.

1077
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,525
She loves the schnitzel,
you know what I mean?

1078
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,049
You know what?
Tongue feels a little dry.

1079
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,527
Let's go get you some water, honey.
We'll be back.

1080
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,085
That's a big tongue,
big tongue.

1081
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,567
Get over here,
get over here. Ew!

1082
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,641
What are you doing here?

1083
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,882
I don't know, saving the day.
Helping. Hello?

1084
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,849
Who are you talking to?
What are you looking at?

1085
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,726
I can't see in these things.

1086
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,921
This is what
you're gonna do.

1087
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,725
You're gonna tell them that you ate a
bad sauerkraut omelet for breakfast

1088
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,167
and that you are feeling like
you're sick and that you gotta go.

1089
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,924
Katherine, I can't go.
Okay? Why?

1090
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,647
Because I texted a picture of my
new equipment to my ex-girlfriend.

1091
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,767
Oh, you're disgusting.

1092
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,644
And I forgot she's
engaged to a UFC fighter.

1093
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,563
He wants to punch
me in the face.

1094
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,210
I wanna punch you
in the face.

1095
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,446
Hey, guys,
how we doing?

1096
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,164
I am just waiting for
the money for the ticket.

1097
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,607
Mmm-hmm. So you are coming?
And I am paying?

1098
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,967
Yes. Dolph has zero dollars.

1099
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,087
Whoops!
Okay.

1100
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,810
Let me see if I can
find my credit card.

1101
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,881
Oh, here it is.

1102
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,044
That's for sleeping
with my wife, pal.

1103
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,928
There you go.
Thank you.

1104
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,161
Hey, hey!

1105
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,004
Didn't have time to
make any reservations,

1106
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,320
but I need
two rooms, please.

1107
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,606
Oh, of course.

1108
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,603
Unfortunately, we only
have our suites left.

1109
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,841
Oh, boy.

1110
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,526
The Waldorf Astoria
at $8,000 per night

1111
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,489
and the Presidential
at $12,000.

1112
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,170
$12,000 a night?
Mmm-hmm.

1113
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,089
Do the Rolling Stones come and
play for me while I'm in there?

1114
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,003
What the hell are you talking about?
Why is it so much?

1115
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,161
Is it made out of panda?

1116
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,605
I've used that somewhere
else, but is it?

1117
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,481
No, but you've made
some terrific suggestions

1118
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,840
and I'm gonna jot them down.

1119
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,207
Are you a member of the
Hilton Honors Rewards program?

1120
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,327
No, I'm not.

1121
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,562
Oh. That's too bad.
You should join.

1122
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,926
Yeah.

1123
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,646
Yay!

1124
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,849
Just got reamed.
I mean, I got the rooms.

1125
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,561
Who wants to go
to the beach?

1126
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,966
Me!

1127
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,451
Who wants to start drinking?

1128
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,324
Me!

1129
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,885
Okay, yeah,

1130
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,804
I would create a fake family
for that. Oh, my God!

1131
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,610
You know what?
You're disgusting.

1132
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,683
Mumsy, please
do come in.

1133
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,206
The water's as lovely
as Westminster in May.

1134
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,566
No, honey,
I'm good.

1135
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,051
I don't really feel like
swimming right now.

1136
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,441
What is this from,
my Liebchen?

1137
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,126
Don't you be intimidated by
her whole thing right there,

1138
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,440
which is perfect.

1139
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,761
Oh, come on. Like
she's intimidated.

1140
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,888
I hope when I'm her
age I look that good.

1141
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,047
Yes, right?

1142
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,850
You can look that good

1143
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,162
if you don't
take the elevators

1144
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,210
and only take the
stairs like Cary Grant.

1145
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,724
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs.

1146
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,684
Hey, why are
we stopped here?

1147
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,921
Uh, what's the matter?

1148
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,365
I can't look at
engagement rings?

1149
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,363
Engagement rings?
Yeah, you heard me.

1150
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,091
Look all you want,
but you and I both know that

1151
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,287
you're gonna get
sick of this hottie

1152
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,124
and you're gonna be back
on the prowl next week.

1153
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,089
Nope. I'm telling you,
is this girl not cute?

1154
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,321
Yeah, she's really cute.

1155
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,481
Is she not the sweetest?

1156
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,686
The nicest person
I've ever met.

1157
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,245
Did you ever see her lips?

1158
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,765
I think she has the best
lips I've ever seen.

1159
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,087
They're like an inner tube
and I just wanna sit on it.

1160
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,531
You know what I mean?
And just, like...

1161
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,410
Do you want me
to knock you out, or...

1162
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,400
No, I'm saying you
should sit on her lips.

1163
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,726
Anyways...

1164
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,565
You know, this whole situation
reminds me of a song.

1165
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,451
# Danny is a big
plastic surgeon

1166
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,046
# Who never had time
for a wife

1167
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,563
# And he's friends with Davy
Who's still in the Navy

1168
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,404
Piano Man?
Why Piano Man?

1169
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,800
No, it's "Piano Dan."

1170
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,564
That's based on your life.
it's a little Eddie remix.

1171
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,807
Uh-huh.

1172
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,124
# Eddie used to have an afro
And pimples all over his face

1173
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,483
# So he popped and he poked
'em And Clearasil soaked 'em

1174
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,642
# But ladies still
greet him with mace #

1175
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,131
I was maced one time.

1176
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,566
Five times.

1177
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,370
So, guys, we're here to get
to know each other better.

1178
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,566
Yes.
Yeah.

1179
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,085
Dolph, let's
start with you.

1180
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,969
So, what line of
work are you in?

1181
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,920
Well, Palmer,
I am in sheep.

1182
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,084
I'm sorry. I don't
know what you mean.

1183
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,723
I am a sheep shipper.

1184
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,241
Oh.
Yes.

1185
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,482
You know, people,
they don't buy the sheep

1186
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,125
from the local
sheepherder anymore.

1187
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,165
Really? They don't?

1188
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,802
No, they don't.
They go online!

1189
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,770
Yes! They go
on the Interweb,

1190
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,204
to my website,
gotprettysheep.com.

1191
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,930
And leave this,
please. Thank you.

1192
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,162
Now, people go on.
They see the pictures of the sheep,

1193
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,691
and they pick
the ones they want.

1194
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,086
You know, it's like,
"l want that one.

1195
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,367
"You know, it's very stylish.
You know, it's a stylish one."

1196
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,966
Goes, "Oh, no, I want the shy
one who doesn't want to baa."

1197
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,690
Or they buy
the sassy one,

1198
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,242
who's like, "Hey,
I see you, baa, baa."

1199
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,964
So, what do the people
do with these sheep?

1200
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,131
Whatever they want!
Sky is the limit.

1201
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,810
You know, some
have them as pets.

1202
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,008
Some have them as
security for the house.

1203
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,486
A lot of the people...

1204
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,563
The new thing
is training them

1205
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,325
to fight each other
in the Sheep Fight Club.

1206
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,483
Sheep Fight Clubs?

1207
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,529
Yes. All the sheeps,
they get together.

1208
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,206
They baa, all you hear is,
"Baa, baa, baa."

1209
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,805
And then you see
hoof, kick, hoof, kick,

1210
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,644
hoof, kick, baa,
baa, baa, baa, baa!

1211
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,001
And then he's out.

1212
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,528
And that is how we met.
She bought a sheep from me.

1213
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,366
Really? Why?

1214
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,528
Children?
Okay, tune out.

1215
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,571
Okay, 'cause some secrets are coming
out, all right? Some adult ones.

1216
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,530
She likes to shave the sheep

1217
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,884
for the pelt for the
sex, sexuals, yes.

1218
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,129
She has got
a real fetish

1219
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,571
for the wool
and stuff, you know.

1220
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,603
We do this thing
called "sheepstenein."

1221
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,763
Danny? Would you
come with me, please?

1222
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,205
Yeah. Absolutely.

1223
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,645
So, we're gonna
leave right now.

1224
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,484
So you guys play that game
that we always love to play,

1225
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,607
Nobody Talk game.

1226
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,886
And start now.

1227
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,327
I'm sorry, we're leaving.
I can't do it. No.

1228
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,640
I'm gonna kill that guy.
He's lost it.

1229
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,250
He was going sheep-crazy,
I'll give you that.

1230
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,526
Where is your
hand right now?

1231
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,846
You wanna see
where it is?

1232
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,331
It's not even here
anymore! It's gone!

1233
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,447
How about I beat him up?

1234
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,204
You can beat him up
with me. it'll be fun.

1235
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,044
I don't want to!
I have to go.

1236
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,162
Don't bail on me right now!
Don't make that face at me.

1237
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,446
I cannot stand that face.

1238
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,601
Katherine?

1239
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,569
Katherine Murphy?

1240
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,283
Oh, my God,
Devlin Adams.

1241
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,130
Devlin? Devlin
as in taking a...

1242
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,242
Taking?
From what I see...

1243
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,567
It's my favorite
college Devlin!

1244
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,563
Both of us here at this
resort at the same time.

1245
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,362
I didn't know you came
to places like this.

1246
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,487
Here we go.

1247
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,607
Honey!

1248
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,404
Honey, I want you
to meet someone.

1249
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,527
This is one of my best
friends from my sorority.

1250
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,410
Katherine, this is my
husband, Ian Maxtone Jones.

1251
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,521
Pleasure.

1252
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,450
You might've heard of him.
He invented the iPod.

1253
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,764
Well, of course
he did. The iPod.

1254
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,127
The idea just came
to me in the shower.

1255
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,802
A shower that I was
taking with Devlin.

1256
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,608
So, this is a cabana you guys
got yourselves here, huh?

1257
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,161
Because my skin is so white.
I don't like to get it burned.

1258
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,970
Even at night?

1259
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,685
Well, in Hawaii, you
never know with the sun.

1260
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,921
Very, very strong.

1261
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,849
So you mean like
a moonburn or...

1262
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,442
You look fantastic.
Oh...

1263
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,840
You look great.

1264
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,163
I'm so glad you got your
teeth fixed. Much better.

1265
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,925
You are just the same glorious
Devlin that I remember.

1266
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,844
Oh, my God, I ran into
Sandra Wernick last month.

1267
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,809
The poor thing. She's already
divorced and she has a child.

1268
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,691
She's a single mother.
it's a disaster.

1269
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,370
I feel so bad for her.

1270
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,165
Are you married?

1271
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,090
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1272
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,051
Oh! I've neglected to
introduce you to Danny,

1273
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,927
Daniel Leroy Maccabee III,
my husband.

1274
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,163
Yes. If you
want me to stay,

1275
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,366
will you just go
with it, honey?

1276
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,931
Come here and please
meet Devlin and Ian.

1277
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,606
Hey.
This is Daniel.

1278
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,086
IPod, what's up?
How are you?

1279
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,207
I'm fine.

1280
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,328
Invented it.
Pleasure. I heard.

1281
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,284
Devlin, I think I spoke
about you with my wife

1282
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,124
in the bathroom one
or two times, right?

1283
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,326
We did.

1284
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,805
Number two.

1285
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,484
We did it twice, yes.

1286
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,246
So, chief, tell me,
what do you do for a living?

1287
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,368
I'm also an inventor,
just like you.

1288
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,130
I invented the barking hand.

1289
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,684
I got you.
But you're sunburned?

1290
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,206
No.
What?

1291
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,051
You are a surgeon.

1292
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,885
He's a plastic surgeon,
and he's one of the best

1293
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,724
according to
Los Angeles Magazine.

1294
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,326
Touchdown!

1295
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,209
Yes. Well,
that, yeah.

1296
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,407
Touched it down.

1297
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,847
We gotta go back. We have to run.
It was great to see you.

1298
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,525
We have to get back
to our kids. So...

1299
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,927
You have kids?

1300
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,287
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, two, actually.

1301
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,567
We couldn't wait
to start creating lives.

1302
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,849
And by the way,
I created these children

1303
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,524
in the shower. Right?

1304
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,205
You did.
You know what I'm saying, homeboy?

1305
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,321
That is funny.

1306
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,925
Wow, you've been
together a long time.

1307
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,924
Am I gonna leave
this girl? Look at her.

1308
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,206
Still gets the
flag up the pole,

1309
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,611
if you know
what I mean.

1310
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,206
Bing-bang.
An iRod, I should say.

1311
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,930
Oh. Come on, hit that.
Why'd you leave me hanging so long?

1312
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,008
You're so clever.
That's so silly.

1313
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,525
The four of us
should get together

1314
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,886
and have dinner
one night.

1315
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,480
Oh! That would be almost
like a dream of mine.

1316
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,610
If we could ever get ourselves
out of the bedroom.

1317
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,041
Katherine Murphy,
look at you!

1318
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,363
Oh, no, not Murphy anymore.
Leroy Maccabee.

1319
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,521
That's right.

1320
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,605
The third. Anyway, so it was great
to see you and meet you, Ian.

1321
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,802
The big E. Love the
Shuffle, by the way.

1322
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,088
Good to meet you.
Bye! Thanks. You, too!

1323
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,288
What are you talking
about? She was nice.

1324
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,442
I'm gonna kill you. Come on.
You need me, though, right?

1325
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,681
I don't believe
that just happened.

1326
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,046
I like that you need me.
How's that make you feel?

1327
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,726
Please, it feels like a oar door
just slowly shut on my soul.

1328
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,961
Come here! Listen.
What?

1329
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,326
Do you know how
I feel right now?

1330
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,527
You were getting
me so upset,

1331
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,647
bringing me into
that web of lies.

1332
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,847
My hand's right
here right now.

1333
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,001
Oh, my hand's right there.

1334
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,286
You know what?
I hate you right now.

1335
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,442
I've gotta write out
a bunch of index cards

1336
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,204
just to keep up
with these lies.

1337
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,203
Yeah, and you're gonna make me copies, too.
And one more thing.

1338
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,005
Oh, my God, why are we
leaving the hotel right now?

1339
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,491
Why did you wake me up?

1340
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,681
Because, Grandpa,

1341
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,644
I signed us up for the
all-day adventure tour.

1342
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,485
We're gonna go hiking in the
rainforest, and kayaking down rivers

1343
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,290
and swimming
under waterfalls.

1344
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,402
Swimming. I hope
you mean skinny-dipping.

1345
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,970
I'm gonna
suggest swimming.

1346
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,808
I, however, am fine
with some man nudity, Danny.

1347
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,646
Okay, so Swiss Family
nightmare is coming with us.

1348
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,529
That's so we can bond?

1349
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,648
Oh, that'll be great!

1350
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,368
it's bloody
breathtaking out here!

1351
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,522
Ls this where the
blue Avatar people live?

1352
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,331
Yeah, the blue Avatar people
and I think that black pig.

1353
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,683
Where?
The pig.

1354
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,683
Look, how cute.
Looks like Babe.

1355
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,162
Oh, my God!
Go, Go!

1356
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,004
Come on,
go, go!

1357
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,044
The pig is
eating my body!

1358
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,207
Keep your eyes
on the river, sweetheart.

1359
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,886
Yes. I was looking
at the canyon.

1360
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,921
Hey, what're
you guys doing?

1361
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,368
That bridge can only handle
one person at a time!

1362
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,001
Go, go, go!

1363
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,242
What'd he say?
What'd you say?

1364
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,283
Holy Devlin! Ow!

1365
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,241
Come on, let's go.

1366
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,125
Piggyback times are
magical times, aren't they?

1367
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,202
Yeah, aren't they?
You're warping my spine now.

1368
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,529
I think Kiki slipped.

1369
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,682
Oh, Father, I just love
spending time with you!

1370
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,882
Oh, my God!

1371
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,690
You guys, look at this!

1372
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,769
Oh, my God!
It's lovely!

1373
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,241
Wow!
That is unbelievable.

1374
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,609
I don't know about you guys,
but I am gonna go cool off.

1375
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,450
Really? There could
be black pigs in there.

1376
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,370
I agree.

1377
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,090
Look at that.
That's terrific.

1378
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:24,763
Does the hotel know you took
those pillows, honey?

1379
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,088
She really wears
that bikini well.

1380
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,441
Yeah.

1381
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,803
You know what she'd wear well?
Dental floss and a pirate hat.

1382
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,610
Don't say that.
Absolutely gross.

1383
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,445
Oh, my God!
Gorgeous!

1384
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,607
Perfect.

1385
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,769
That was a ten!
A perfect ten! Yay!

1386
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,880
So, AI Jolson, you mind
jumping in the water

1387
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,287
and also screaming on the way
down, "l love my daddy"?

1388
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,811
Okay.

1389
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,641
Yeah, do it,
do it for me.

1390
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,251
Do it for Da-da.
I love my daddy.

1391
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,448
Daddy is my favorite adult!

1392
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,608
You're paying her
enough for this, right?

1393
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,690
And I love you,
my little British crumpet!

1394
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,444
All right, homeboy,
you're up next. Let's go.

1395
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,244
Come up with
something on your own.

1396
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,685
You gotta squeeze
out another log?

1397
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,524
What happened?
What'd he whisper to you?

1398
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,491
Water's too deep.

1399
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,005
Water's too deep for what?

1400
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,321
He can't swim.

1401
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,450
He can't swim?

1402
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,240
And you wanna swim
with the dolphins?

1403
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,163
That makes a lot of sense.

1404
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,485
Haunt thought it through.

1405
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,324
No kidding you
didn't think it through.

1406
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,209
Thought about spending all my
money, though, didn't you?

1407
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,687
Danny!
I'm saying, I'm not the kid's...

1408
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:34,161
Okay. No one taught
you how to swim, huh?

1409
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,882
Well, my dad's supposed
to, but he's busy.

1410
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,128
Uh-huh.
Busy being an idiot.

1411
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,842
You guys have to come in,
the water feels magical!

1412
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,647
I got something magical, too.
Right in the downstairs area.

1413
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,404
I don't high-five
when it's...

1414
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,686
Downstairs area!

1415
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,490
No, put it away. Sorry.
No, stop.

1416
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:06,484
You know what? I think Mommy's
gonna explore the magical waters.

1417
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,562
Honey, are you okay to hang
out here with fake Daddy?

1418
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,241
Sure.

1419
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,850
Really? You're
gonna get undressed?

1420
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,007
What are you doing?

1421
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,685
What?
You got a bathing cap, too?

1422
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,006
You're the worst.

1423
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,050
A 1920s swimming
gown on, honey?

1424
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:21,323
Don't do it.
Don't take it off.

1425
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,402
Yeah.
I have to be alone.

1426
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,721
Okay.

1427
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,562
God, I gotta start
taking the stairs more.

1428
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,761
Don't buy that line.

1429
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,247
She takes spinning classes
like they're M&M's.

1430
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,764
I think he's
wearing my underwear.

1431
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,361
What is he doing?

1432
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,768
Yo, I guarantee you fall!

1433
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,241
I'm all set.

1434
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,081
OW!

1435
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,811
Thank you, God.

1436
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,890
I wanna climb
Palmer Mountain,

1437
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,689
so what do you say
we get rid of these kids?

1438
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,445
No. They had them
last night. It's our turn.

1439
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,927
Isn't that how things
work? We alternate?

1440
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,485
What?
No.

1441
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,444
I get the kids...
I had them today.

1442
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,846
That counted
as a "me" day

1443
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,001
and then she gets
them at night.

1444
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,326
That's how we do it.
Oh.

1445
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,081
Dolph, Devlin, do you
want us to watch the kids

1446
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,242
so that you guys can
have a little alone time?

1447
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,449
I don't think...
Yes! Absoshnutely!

1448
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,846
We are sleeping together!

1449
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,724
You guys have your own beds
and it's our time!

1450
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:43,491
So we're gonna watch them. Good.

1451
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,884
You guys wanna come
take a look at the balcony?

1452
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,121
I think I saw some
dolphins around here.

1453
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,449
Dolphins? Hey, he loves
those, right? Dolphins.

1454
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,681
Sorry. Okay, go.

1455
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,091
All right, let go.
Come on.

1456
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:55,571
Get the dolphins.
Bye, you guys.

1457
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,324
That's why we're here,
the dolphins.

1458
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,521
See you out there.

1459
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,091
Listen, if anything happens

1460
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,730
and you need any...
And I mean anything,

1461
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,006
you have to call me.

1462
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,565
I'm good at this,
I swear to you.

1463
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,802
I used to baby-sit Eddie
when we were children.

1464
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,248
Eddie is your fault?
No,no,no.

1465
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,129
But I want you
to enjoy tonight.

1466
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,281
Come on, it's
like a free night.

1467
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,771
You can do
whatever you want.

1468
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,683
You can knit yourself
some socks

1469
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,683
or shock people with
your sneaky hot body.

1470
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,484
I don't know what you're talking about.
Cary Grant?

1471
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,005
I'm just gonna
sit in my room

1472
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,600
and worry about you
and them and everything.

1473
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,569
What about just
hang out platonically

1474
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,244
with Eddie tonight?
Have some dinner?

1475
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,731
Or is he not good enough?

1476
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,849
You need Brian, the guy
from Foghat, around here.

1477
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,161
That really bothered you

1478
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,129
that I went to
lunch with that guy.

1479
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,770
What do you mean, you
went to lunch with him?

1480
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,842
I told you I was
going to lunch with him.

1481
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,729
I thought it was
he asked you to lunch

1482
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,040
and you were
gonna like scoff at it.

1483
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,527
But you did?
You fell for his charms?

1484
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,327
I don't even
understand what this is.

1485
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,731
It's the beard, man.

1486
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,166
It doesn't move!

1487
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,005
Well, yeah, in the wind, man.
it's flapping around.

1488
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,611
All right. You know what?
I'll tell you this.

1489
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,251
The guy made it through
an entire lunch with a woman

1490
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,010
without making up
a fake life.

1491
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,600
Ah.

1492
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,366
You just hurt me.

1493
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,485
That was not nice,
but it was the truth.

1494
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,642
And I speak the truth.

1495
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,410
Please pay attention
to my children.

1496
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,681
Everything will be nice.

1497
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,570
They serve room
service in the hallway.

1498
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,048
I'm so nauseous.
Okay. Bye.

1499
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,329
Alone at last!

1500
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,804
Let's play the game.

1501
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,928
We were doing so
good with the game.

1502
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,606
"If you could be one person
besides yourself,

1503
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,041
"who would you be?"

1504
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,769
Rachael Ray,
because I've always

1505
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,841
wanted to know how to cook.

1506
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,724
Really?
Oh, she's darling.

1507
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,486
You know what?
I don't really wanna be anyone else.

1508
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,245
I'm happy with who I am.
I choose me.

1509
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,562
Or Captain Kirk.
Either one.

1510
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,449
See, that's a good one.
All right.

1511
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,801
What about you, Bart?

1512
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,929
Mr. DeCesare.

1513
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,242
Our mailman? Why?

1514
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,288
He just seems like he's
got it all figured out.

1515
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,090
We're getting deep.

1516
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,451
Okay, moving on.
Uh...

1517
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,288
Okay. "Name something
that makes you sad."

1518
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,124
That Judi Dench has never won
the Oscar for Best Actress.

1519
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,884
It's a travesty.

1520
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,282
That 'N Sync broke up.

1521
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,607
Yeah. That was
rough on all of us.

1522
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,969
Who's 'N Sync?

1523
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,127
Sadness.
Bart, you're up.

1524
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,282
I don't wanna say mine.

1525
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,249
Okay. Let's move on then.

1526
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,447
Hey!

1527
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,762
Honey, come on. You can
share anything with us.

1528
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,967
Yeah, share.

1529
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,804
He looks like he's about
to lose it, but okay.

1530
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,129
When my dad doesn't
have time for me.

1531
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,485
Come on, it's okay.

1532
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,689
We're okay.
We're okay. it's fine.

1533
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,411
It's all gonna be okay.
Come on.

1534
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,642
We don't need him
in our lives.

1535
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,127
Wow.

1536
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,531
No, no, no, he's...

1537
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,806
We're okay.
It's fine.

1538
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,445
It's all gonna be okay.

1539
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,445
This has nothing to...

1540
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,887
This is, like, from
a long time ago!

1541
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,009
It's okay.

1542
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,847
What are you doing?

1543
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,528
Well, that was
a major setback.

1544
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,686
"When my dad doesn't have time for me.

1545
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,606
We're sorry.

1546
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,841
I know you're sorry.

1547
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,684
I know you got real stuff
going on with your family.

1548
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,001
And it's painful.

1549
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,963
But you gotta
just hold it in

1550
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,690
till you get to
the mainland again.

1551
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:31,961
You're the ones who
wanted to come here

1552
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,246
and go swimming
with the dolphins

1553
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:35,488
or standing with the dolphins
because you can't swim.

1554
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,643
Can you act professional?
Yes, sir.

1555
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,848
For at least two more days,
until I kill you off

1556
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,042
in a boarding school
train accident?

1557
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,845
I thought it was
a car accident.

1558
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,041
I don't know.
Either that

1559
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,451
or a science explosion,
just something.

1560
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,761
You're gonna be dead soon.
That's the good news. Okay?

1561
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,087
So, can you just focus
for a few more days?

1562
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,531
Yes.
Good.

1563
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,206
So, give me some fake hugs
right now and laugh real loud

1564
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,520
like we're the happiest
family on earth.

1565
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,210
Okay.
Is that possible?

1566
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,761
And laughing,
laughing, laughing.

1567
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,321
Okay, that's it.
Laugh louder, louder.

1568
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,291
I love you guys!

1569
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,880
Hey, sweetie!
What's going on? What's up?

1570
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,089
So, kids, I just got off
the phone with your mom

1571
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,760
and you guys are gonna
have plenty of time

1572
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,285
to spend with
your dad tomorrow

1573
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,483
because she and I are gonna
have a nice, long spa day.

1574
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,641
Aw!

1575
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,769
Awesome!
Awesome, awesome.

1576
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,763
You guys are so...

1577
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,885
I'll see you in a minute, okay?
I love you.

1578
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,004
Okay, he's losing it.
Okay, good night.

1579
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,161
He's losing it.

1580
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,289
All right, here we go.
Everybody out.

1581
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:42,765
So, what are we doing?

1582
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,241
Palmer forgot her
camera in the room

1583
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,845
so I'm gonna have
a surprise for her

1584
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,285
when she gets
back from the spa.

1585
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,726
A stolen camera?

1586
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,451
No, some pictures of us
having a great time

1587
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,086
reassuring her of all
the fun we have together.

1588
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,165
I forgot to flush the toilet
before I left the hotel.

1589
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:00,971
So she's gonna
have two surprises.

1590
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,283
Okay. No one's supposed
to crap as much as you do.

1591
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,607
You gotta look into that
Pepto Bismol or something.

1592
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,967
Here's your putters. Bing.

1593
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,810
And a bam.
Thank you.

1594
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,964
Let's just look right in the camera.
And we're having fun.

1595
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,963
And we're a family.
We love each other.

1596
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,806
And boo!

1597
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,561
All right, let's do the old
Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?

1598
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,648
So boom,
that's in the hole.

1599
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,921
And you're
excited about that,

1600
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,049
and we're happy for him, and...

1601
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:29,482
Maggie just hit the ball, but
you followed through too much

1602
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,965
and it made you
fall on your back.

1603
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,445
Okay, but... Look at this.

1604
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,727
You're laughing, but I'm a
concerned father, so I'm like,

1605
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,723
"Oh, my God."

1606
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,650
All right, now,

1607
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,762
let's just laugh at something I
say, because I'm a funny dad.

1608
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,842
You're very close with me, and
you think I'm funny, and...

1609
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,246
Why are we always laughing?

1610
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,651
Is there something
wrong with us?

1611
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,600
No. You're just amused by everything I say.
So, here we go.

1612
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,206
Can we take a break?
Do something really fun?

1613
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,004
No, we're not doing
anything fun, man.

1614
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,650
We're here to
fake having fun.

1615
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:55,921
Come on.
Right to the camera.

1616
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,890
Don't worry. We never have fun
with our real dad either.

1617
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,484
Oh, man.

1618
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,207
All right. How's this?

1619
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,805
I'll teach you
how to swim, okay?

1620
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,644
Before your mother
gets back

1621
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,166
from the "spa day"
in four hours?

1622
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,004
Is that even possible?
Yeah.

1623
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,969
But we're gonna take one more
picture, if you don't mind.

1624
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,367
Make that two
pictures. Maggie.

1625
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,091
Throw this straight in the
air. Make it look like...

1626
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,889
On the count of three, one, two, three.

1627
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,007
Okay.

1628
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,690
Now, Michael,
lay down.

1629
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,608
On your back. And...

1630
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,160
Yeah, all the way over.
See if you can clench this.

1631
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,083
Now look like
you're in pain.

1632
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,531
ooh!

1633
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,921
It took my friend a whole
summer to learn how to swim.

1634
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,651
How're you gonna
teach me so quick?

1635
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,207
I'm gonna do it the same way
my grandfather taught me.

1636
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,605
Don't worry.

1637
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,808
It took Grandpa
eight hours to teach us.

1638
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,881
It was a nightmare.

1639
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,811
But there's two of us
here now, and we're sober.

1640
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,245
You're gonna be fine.

1641
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,565
All right.
You're doing great.

1642
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,404
Is he doing great?
He's doing great.

1643
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,045
Okay. We want to
advance a little, though.

1644
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,043
I need you to swim
to Uncle Eddie.

1645
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,645
If you get there without
touching the bottom,

1646
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,051
we'll give you
a dolphin cookie.

1647
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,091
Is that what your
grandpa gave you?

1648
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,171
No, Grandpa gave us something
he'd call a Heineken.

1649
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,287
I want one of those.

1650
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:15,600
No. Stick with
the dolphin cookie.

1651
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,451
Yeah. They hurt less when
they get thrown at your head.

1652
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,050
God, he was a sick man.

1653
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,407
Yeah. Okay?
Are we ready?

1654
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,845
Don't think about it.
Commit. Kick, kick.

1655
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,763
Get the cookie.
Move your feet.

1656
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:28,930
Kick, kick!

1657
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,923
Right there!
Reach for it! You got it!

1658
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,127
Doing good, buddy!

1659
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,246
There you go!

1660
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,408
My boy! That
was terrific, buddy.

1661
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,960
Have your cookie.
We're gonna move on, though.

1662
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,411
Hey, Devlin?

1663
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,489
Devlin?
Yeah?

1664
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,848
So, Danny's birthday
is next week,

1665
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,524
and I have no idea
what to get him.

1666
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,124
Well, don't get him a tie.

1667
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,362
He has 100 of them
and he never wears them.

1668
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,521
That's good to know.

1669
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,929
He loves books
on tape for his oar.

1670
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,206
Fishing gear.

1671
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,921
Loves it.
Doesn't use it.

1672
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,445
Can't take the fish
off of the hook

1673
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,443
once he catches it,
so he just collects it.

1674
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:10,482
He loves candy. Jelly Bellies.
Loves them, his favorite.

1675
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,608
But he only likes the Cotton
Candy and the Peanut Butter.

1676
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,808
So you have to buy the bag
of the Jelly Bellies,

1677
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,450
separate the Cotton Candy
and the Peanut Butter

1678
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:17,646
and put them into a little...

1679
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,609
It's a kind of Ziploc
baggies that I got online.

1680
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,648
You know so much about him.

1681
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:23,806
Yeah.

1682
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,721
I've known the guy forever.

1683
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,688
Music. Loves music.

1684
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,042
But anything after '95,
don't bother.

1685
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,326
You'll lose him.

1686
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,723
That's when I finished
my Girl Scouts.

1687
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,570
All right. How many
cookies do we got left?

1688
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,560
Maybe about forty!

1689
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,321
What do you think,
40 feet for 40 cookies?

1690
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,129
Can you handle that?
You need a little rest?

1691
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,326
Let's do this.

1692
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,404
Really? Okay, he's ready!
He's ready to rock!

1693
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,845
Almost.

1694
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,207
What? No.

1695
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,160
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen,
off come the floaties!

1696
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,170
This is getting serious!

1697
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,446
Are you sure about
this, Michael?

1698
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,250
Hell, yeah.
All right.

1699
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,408
No matter what,
you're a good man, okay?

1700
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,763
Keep kicking.
I'm here if you need me.

1701
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,887
You got this.

1702
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,525
Go!
Go, Michael!

1703
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,210
Go! Breathe!
Yeah!

1704
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,800
Kick it!
Go!

1705
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,370
Move your arms!
Yeah!

1706
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,690
He doesn't have
floaties on!

1707
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,366
Oh, my God!

1708
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,766
Get the cookies!

1709
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,645
Come on,
sweetheart! You've got it!

1710
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,846
A little bit more,
little bit more.

1711
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,484
Swim! Swim!
Oh, my God!

1712
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,971
Come on!
Just a little bit more!

1713
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,885
Keep going, Michael!
Don't give up!

1714
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,601
Very nice!

1715
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,531
That's my boy!
Yeah, buddy!

1716
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,241
I did it! I did it!
Thank you!

1717
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,890
No way, that
was you, buddy.

1718
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,486
That was awesome.
Way to go!

1719
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,085
What are
we looking at?

1720
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,926
Jeez. Oh, God. Devlin.

1721
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,930
Devlin. Oh, God.
You snuck up on me.

1722
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,730
Did I? Oh...
Yes.

1723
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,321
Do you startle easily?
That's a sign of menopause.

1724
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,447
Hmm...

1725
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,045
Devlin?

1726
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,327
Palmer Dodge,
this is Devlin.

1727
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,482
She and I went to
college together.

1728
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,606
This is Palmer Dodge.
Aloha, Palmer.

1729
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,490
Is this your daughter?

1730
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,330
No,no,no.
I'm actually the girlfriend.

1731
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,487
Whose girlfriend?

1732
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,967
Yes, hi.

1733
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,369
I am the Dolph. Willkommen.
And you're very beautiful.

1734
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,602
Married, flattered.
Thanks. Where's Danny?

1735
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:42,367
Danny is in the water teaching
our little boy how to swim.

1736
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,601
Hi, Doctor!

1737
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,687
He was so sweet.

1738
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,001
You know what's so crazy is
that I have never met anybody

1739
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,451
with the first name
Devlin before.

1740
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,205
You know, and here you are,
and your name's Devlin and...

1741
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,685
Shark attack!

1742
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,805
We are playing Bavarian pool
rugby and now I'm in the lead.

1743
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,121
Okay, bye!

1744
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,531
She's trying to beat me,
but she won't.

1745
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,609
NO OHS Can!

1746
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:06,806
This is fun!

1747
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,167
Anyway, something's opened up
in our schedule tonight.

1748
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:10,890
So, we were wondering
if you and Danny

1749
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,200
were good to go for dinner.

1750
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,561
Oceano's. Seven o'clock.
Oh, no...

1751
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,849
Oh, no, you don't!
She's like a shark. Come on.

1752
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,129
Is it a bad night?
Are you two fighting?

1753
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,804
No! We're not fighting.

1754
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,042
No, we just, We're delighting.
We're just fine.

1755
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,811
No, that's great. Tonight's gonna happen.
Yeah, perfect.

1756
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,684
Perfect. Anyway,
see you tonight!

1757
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,040
Okay, Devlin.

1758
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:32,208
Oh, my God!
Dolph, let her breathe!

1759
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,322
Yes, I...

1760
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,881
Dolph!
What?

1761
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,047
What was that?

1762
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,361
I was... Were you under...

1763
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,002
I don't understand.
Why would you say yes?

1764
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,890
Because I didn't know,
I didn't say no.

1765
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,691
I'm not leaving here.
What would I tell Palmer?

1766
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,445
What's going on, sweetie?

1767
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,527
So, today, you know, with
Dolph pushing me in the pool.

1768
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,886
It was weird, right?

1769
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,164
No,no,no.
He's a sheepherder.

1770
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,526
That's what those
guys do, you know?

1771
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,489
They do a lot
of horseplay

1772
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,528
and that's kind of
initiation time for you.

1773
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,205
You're in the gang,
I think.

1774
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,804
Okay. Yeah.

1775
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,641
Well, I was thinking
for tonight,

1776
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,963
maybe we could have
a little me and you time?

1777
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,371
Oh!

1778
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,961
I'll get my rubber duck
and see you in a sec.

1779
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,601
Yeah, no, I'm not
doing this tonight.

1780
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,802
It's like my first night
alone with the girl.

1781
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,644
All I'm asking you
is one favor!

1782
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,407
Just get this one dinner
with me so I can save face

1783
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,086
with this horrible,
heinous human being.

1784
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,321
What am I gonna
tell Palmer?

1785
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,646
Would you just
put her on the phone?

1786
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,606
Oh, God.

1787
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,809
Tell me she is not
listening to 'N Sync.

1788
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,651
No, no, no. It's coming
from the elevator.

1789
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,081
Hey!

1790
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,764
Danny, that is my jam.

1791
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,090
Someone on
the phone for you.

1792
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,810
I don't know who.
Okay.

1793
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,846
Hello?

1794
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:07,446
What is that?

1795
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,851
It's Palmer.
So?

1796
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:10,684
I need you to get on the phone.
I need you to ask her out.

1797
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,524
I need you to take her as far away
from the hotel for the entire night.

1798
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,726
Would you please
just do this for me?

1799
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,451
No, I'm already eating.
I just wanna hang out. Ow!

1800
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,250
Seriously, I need you.
What are you doing? No.

1801
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,890
Ow! My gosh.

1802
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,769
Take it.
Au right.

1803
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,931
Go for Dolph.

1804
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,601
It's Dolph.

1805
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:26,926
Okay, I got an idea.

1806
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,969
How about you and me,

1807
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,725
we go and get
the dinner tonight?

1808
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:32,926
To supper?

1809
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,240
Tonight?

1810
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,526
Yes, and we get to
know each other,

1811
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,523
because I think it's
important for the kids

1812
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,161
to have good symmetry
in the family unit.

1813
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,362
Yeah, hang on.
Let me check with Danny.

1814
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,689
Dolph wants to do
dinner tonight.

1815
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,530
No. No, no, no.

1816
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,971
All right, tell him yeah.

1817
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,291
Yeah, that's fine.

1818
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,327
Awesome.
Thank you so much.

1819
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,126
What am I supposed
to say to her all night?

1820
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:01,963
You spout crazy nonsense for
hours in Eurotrashenese.

1821
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,403
Just do it, but just do it
far away from the hotel.

1822
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,811
Okay, fine, I'll do it,

1823
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,406
but if I do good, can I
sleep in the bed with you?

1824
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,328
No. Why? You've got
a great private room.

1825
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,087
Hmm, really? Because when
we were in the Napa Valley,

1826
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,686
they said that wasn't a
good time of year for Merlot.

1827
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,003
Oh. How about the
Verite Cabernet?

1828
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,085
Isn't Cabernet
really grapey?

1829
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:38,367
I mean, I like grapey,
but not overly grapey.

1830
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,408
Did you go over
the index cards?

1831
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,529
I glanced at them, yes.

1832
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,727
You glanced at them?

1833
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,285
I graduated med school

1834
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,806
without reading a book.
Just relax.

1835
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,087
Just give us the most
expensive bottle you have

1836
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,810
and it'll probably
be good enough.

1837
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,211
Perfect!

1838
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,525
Look at us, Katherine.
Both so happily married. I mean...

1839
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,370
Can you believe it?

1840
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:02,008
Everything I always
hoped for, right, Yogi?

1841
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,161
Mmm. Boo-Boo.

1842
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,049
My Yogi Bear.
My Boo-Boo.

1843
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,606
Never enough.

1844
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,046
Hold on a second.

1845
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,646
I love the way you smell.

1846
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,291
Nothing smells
as good as Devlin.

1847
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,690
Smelling Devlin,
always a good thing.

1848
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,251
This is really
where we're eating?

1849
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,970
Oh, yes.
No, the hotel says

1850
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,850
it's amazing und very far away.
Yeah, it's good.

1851
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,168
Hey. I want that car.

1852
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,765
I'll give you two
chickens for it.

1853
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,687
Two chickens, that's
very nice of you, but...

1854
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,841
Don't be scared.

1855
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,126
We're just here for dinner.

1856
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,601
Also, this car's worth
about 10,000 chickens.

1857
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,765
Don't pour over me.

1858
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,121
Don't pour over me.

1859
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,204
I'll bring my glass to you.

1860
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,288
So, Danny, you're a
plastic surgeon. Yes.

1861
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,364
Very convenient
for you, Katherine.

1862
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,364
No, this girl's
had nothing done.

1863
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,771
She's just a natural beauty.

1864
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,046
She really is.
Sweetie.

1865
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,601
What about me?
What would you do to fix me?

1866
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,691
Professionally speaking?

1867
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,410
Nothing. l wouldn't
do a thing to you.

1868
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,606
Nothing?

1869
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,370
You're too sweet.

1870
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,769
They already took too much
fat out of your arms,

1871
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,205
but that's what
sleeves are for.

1872
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,203
So, where did you two meet?

1873
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,364
We just, we met
at a concert.

1874
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,720
Sting.
Yeah.

1875
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,723
Live at the Index Card.

1876
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,486
It was a benefit
for the rainforest.

1877
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:45,400
Someone's on
the phone for you.

1878
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,244
I think it's the guy
from The Omen.

1879
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,404
Go for the iMan.

1880
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,401
Hold on a second.

1881
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,251
Can I say something before you
say what you're gonna say?

1882
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,088
Seeing the man who invented
the iPod, on the iPhone,

1883
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,521
saying, "Go for the iMan...
" Yeah.

1884
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,642
...that was like watching
Ronald McDonald

1885
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,410
eat a cheeseburger
off the Grimace.

1886
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,761
I'm serious. That was serious stuff.
it's so true.

1887
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,765
That, to me, was like watching Dr.
Kevorkian kill himself.

1888
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:13,921
Oh, no.

1889
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,401
I'm sorry. This is
one of my foundations.

1890
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,010
I've gotta take this.

1891
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,570
Your virtue, your
intelligence, your passion.

1892
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,725
Your beauty, your drive,
and your womanhood.

1893
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,285
It's something we do
whenever the other leaves.

1894
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,488
We say what we love
most about the other.

1895
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:39,244
That's really nice.
That's big. I like that.

1896
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,600
You guys should try it.

1897
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,486
Yes, we should. We should.
We'll try that later.

1898
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,449
We have to.
Not everyone can do it.

1899
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,725
We'll do it now.

1900
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,882
Right now.
Okay.

1901
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,043
So, broke
and penniless,

1902
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,885
I took to the streets
to sell my wares.

1903
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,202
And by wares,
I mean my body.

1904
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,801
And by body,
I mean my schnitzel.

1905
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,166
Mmm.

1906
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,527
Help! Is there a
veterinarian in the house?

1907
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,046
My pet sheep, he passed out.
He's not breathing!

1908
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,485
I don't know what's
wrong with him!

1909
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,442
Him! Him! He's not a vet, but
he sells sheep for a living.

1910
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,731
Oh, me, yes.

1911
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,168
I do, yes. I am that.

1912
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,401
Please come this way!

1913
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,881
Yes! NOW?

1914
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,161
This way, this way!

1915
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,401
What is this?

1916
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,449
Is that a real sheep?

1917
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:27,771
Okay.

1918
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,000
Yes, um...

1919
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,650
Hello...

1920
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,926
Yes?

1921
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,966
Yes, in my expert opinion,
that sheep is dead.

1922
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,241
I'm very sorry.

1923
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,249
Let's go eat. Okay,
show's over. Let's go.

1924
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,125
Oh! He's still alive!

1925
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,440
Please, you have
to do something!

1926
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,489
Oh, shit on me.

1927
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,889
You look each
other in the eyes

1928
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,725
and you say what you love
about the other. Mmm-hmm.

1929
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,929
We can't just say it?
We gotta look at each other for this thing?

1930
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,929
Okay. Yes.
We're so ready.

1931
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,361
Are you ready?

1932
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,681
Go ahead.

1933
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,088
You're on.
Okay.

1934
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,525
Come on.

1935
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:08,921
Um...

1936
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,964
I love your sense of humor.

1937
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,202
You do?
Mmm-hmm.

1938
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,645
All Of it?

1939
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,361
Every dirty bit of it.

1940
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,246
I love your, uh, stories.

1941
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,721
Yes. They can go long, but...
It's okay.

1942
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,882
...I try to finish strong.
Always entertaining.

1943
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,364
And I love that you...

1944
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,361
Love that you read
the index cards.

1945
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,731
Of course.

1946
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,647
And I love that
you secretly

1947
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,524
have a huge heart,

1948
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,323
and it's just filled
with kindness

1949
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,043
and humility.

1950
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,845
And blood?

1951
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:59,202
I'm sure there's blood.

1952
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,844
I don't know, I...

1953
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:10,721
I just think you're a really
nice person and I really like...

1954
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,727
I really love spending
time with you.

1955
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,964
That's good enough
for me right there.

1956
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,371
Yeah, game over.

1957
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:21,850
Danny?

1958
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,202
Game back on?
We gotta...

1959
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,561
Um...

1960
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,686
Well, I'd like to
start off by saying

1961
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:32,765
that I love the most that
you fixed your teeth.

1962
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,763
Why did l know that...

1963
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,202
They were horrible,
I agree.

1964
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,164
No, no. Um...

1965
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,924
You know what I love?
Mmm-hmm?

1966
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:45,760
How you just do everything
for everybody else

1967
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,564
and you never expect
anything back.

1968
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,885
In fact, when I say thank you, I
don't know, do you hear that or not?

1969
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,085
It's cute.

1970
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,770
And I love...

1971
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:58,445
I just love...

1972
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,405
You're the only person
I've never lied to in my life.

1973
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,250
I swear to God.

1974
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,410
I just trust you more
than anybody in the world.

1975
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,604
You know every
secret about me.

1976
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,125
I love your smile.

1977
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,806
That smile is the magic.

1978
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:22,841
When I'm in the operating room
all I think about is,

1979
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,971
"All right, 20 more minutes,
I get to see the smile."

1980
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,965
lt's just like...

1981
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:32,484
It starts my day,
that smile.

1982
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,204
I won best smile
at our sorority

1983
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,282
three years straight,
right, Katherine?

1984
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:47,604
Not little Bucky here.

1985
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:57,001
Okay, here we go!
Hi, yes! Wee!

1986
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,770
We do the sheep
dance, right?

1987
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,604
We want to live
and dance more, yes.

1988
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,962
Okay, all right. Here we go.
Eat some food.

1989
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,088
Eat the food.
Come on, here we go.

1990
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,241
Couple more zings.

1991
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,209
Make the milk.
Yes, he makes the milk.

1992
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,647
You love it.
You give milk to the baby.

1993
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,690
All right.
One, two, three, here we go!

1994
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,880
Come on!

1995
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:17,724
We got a couple things
that I know how to do!

1996
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,008
Yes, this is a good
test, so why not?

1997
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,808
All right. Here we go.

1998
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,370
You're killing him!

1999
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,571
The sheep lives!
The sheep lives!

2000
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,369
Yes! Here we go,
one more time.

2001
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,885
Here we go. Yes!

2002
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,961
This is what I did.
You saw this. Yes!

2003
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:48,247
Welcome. I am
Tanner Patrick, Jr.

2004
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:52,848
We're ready for the legendary
Oceano's Hula Competition.

2005
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,525
Legendary?
Never heard of it!

2006
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,966
Legendary like the day
you were once sober. So...

2007
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:02,682
She talks the talk,
who will walk the walk

2008
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,571
and walk with me to the
Ladies' Lounge? Feeling it...

2009
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,682
I think you should do it, Devlin.

2010
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,285
Because she would win.

2011
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,842
I'll do it!
Oh! Good show!

2012
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,088
Katherine? How about you?

2013
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:18,971
Come on, this isn't Katherine's thing.
Right, Katherine?

2014
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,806
No, no, not my...
Her speed. Not mine.

2015
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,645
Some people are
just more comfortable

2016
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,643
on the sidelines, so
don't judge her, honey.

2017
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,084
Your honesty, your fearlessness,
and your tickle spot.

2018
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,483
Your creativity, your bravery,
and your taffy nipples.

2019
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,768
Let's go! How do
I win this thing?

2020
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,886
I'm gonna do
this hula thing.

2021
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,565
Oh, don't feel any
pressure, Katherine.

2022
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,922
I'm not the one who
should feel the pressure.

2023
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:50,328
Ladies and gentlemen, a warm
welcome for tonight's hula girls.

2024
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,161
These are my stars.
And here's the key,

2025
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,641
you decide how brightly
they shine tonight.

2026
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,808
You the audience,
judge and jury.

2027
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,450
I like what I see.

2028
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,806
This is my hula palooza.

2029
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,890
You're the judges.

2030
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,248
You're voting for
your favorite hula girl.

2031
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,241
How about we do one over here?

2032
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,727
Can I get a little something-something
up here in the corner?

2033
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,048
Has anybody got a
conscience here tonight?

2034
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,963
Come on, you did well.
You did well.

2035
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,521
Aw!

2036
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,121
lt's tough.

2037
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,164
What do I got over
here? Anybody?

2038
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,201
How tall do you
think that guy is?

2039
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,204
Who? The Tanner guy?
I don't know.

2040
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,361
Yeah, that Tanner.

2041
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,249
Looks pretty tall,
I'd say he's like 6'3".

2042
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,441
Yeah, I don't know.

2043
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,443
Can I get a positive reaction?

2044
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,206
Thank you.

2045
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,646
How about this little girl?
Let's make her night. How about it?

2046
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,928
I like it.
Keep the mojo going.

2047
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,570
How about Big Country
in the corner?

2048
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:53,960
Do I got...

2049
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:56,801
Sorry.

2050
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,211
This is fixed!

2051
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,162
Tall fellow is
lucky to get away.

2052
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,682
Let's pick up
the tempo, boys.

2053
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,171
What? What is that?

2054
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,842
Okay. This is
a lot faster.

2055
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,400
Fabulous!

2056
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,530
Yeah, baby!

2057
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,441
What?

2058
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:20,206
Come on.

2059
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,644
Nobody got cheated
here tonight.

2060
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,370
These are two of
the hottest chicks

2061
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,204
we have ever had up here.

2062
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,645
But our job is not clone.

2063
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:46,520
I need your help,
because I need a winner.

2064
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:47,681
Let me hear you.

2065
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,605
Beautiful!

2066
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,009
Wow, that is gonna
be tough to beat.

2067
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,924
Let's not kid anybody.
How about over here?

2068
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:01,651
There you have it.
We have ourselves...

2069
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,642
That's my Boo-Boo!

2070
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,287
A tie! We have
ourselves a tie.

2071
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,647
That's great.
We both win. Good...

2072
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,285
What's the tiebreaker?

2073
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,442
What's the tiebreaker?

2074
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,687
This is how we settle
ties in my house.

2075
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,842
It's something I like
to call Coconut Smoochie.

2076
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,450
The object of the game is,

2077
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,522
the coconut is in
their midsections.

2078
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,364
It must move all the
way up to their mouths

2079
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,566
without the use
of their hands.

2080
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,766
Focus, focus.

2081
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,322
If you touch the coconut,
you are disqualified.

2082
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,121
Okay. Ready?
One, two, three, get coconutty!

2083
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,123
Okay. Slow.

2084
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,369
Okay, all right.
Calm down, calm down.

2085
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,686
Let me just
bring it up to you.

2086
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,807
Okay, do it.

2087
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,123
Get it up there.
Come on.

2088
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:49,685
Bring your coconuts
down to me.

2089
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,171
Okay. Oh, my coconuts.

2090
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,964
Pull up. All right.
I'm so low.

2091
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,521
Squeeze your coconuts.
Squeeze them.

2092
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,650
Use every crevice
you can. Don't be afraid.

2093
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,245
I can't get it up here.

2094
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,651
I'm trying.

2095
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,644
Would you be quiet?

2096
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,729
Stay there.
Wait.

2097
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,007
Okay, that's good.
Is that good?

2098
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,600
Sorry about this,
by the way.

2099
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,045
Really? You're really
sorry about this?

2100
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,531
No, I'm not. I like it.

2101
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:15,486
Oh, yeah!

2102
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,761
Pick it up,
pick it up!

2103
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,683
Not with your hands,
you buffoon!

2104
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,887
Come on!

2105
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,964
Look what he's doing!
What happened? I can't see.

2106
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,850
Focus. Take it slow,
take it slow.

2107
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,570
He's got it!

2108
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,007
That's not fair.
He can't do that.

2109
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,924
No, that's a clean
pick-up right there.

2110
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,844
Okay. Bring it over here.

2111
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,524
Go!Go!Go!

2112
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,371
I got it.

2113
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,570
There's still time.
Let's go.

2114
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,131
You can touch
each other,

2115
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,725
you cannot touch
the coconut.

2116
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,081
Hang on, hang on.

2117
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:53,288
What's going on? What is that?
What do you use?

2118
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,442
What's the hold-up?
You still got that perfume on, huh?

2119
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,567
Would you stop it?

2120
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:57,841
Smells good.
Come on, let's go.

2121
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,922
Have you got it to your
mouth yet, Boo-Boo?

2122
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:03,641
Stop putting
your ass in my face.

2123
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,201
I like it.
That's my girl. Okay.

2124
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:12,403
We've got a winner! We have a winner!
We have a winner.

2125
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:15,765
Coconut Smoochie
champions right here.

2126
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,881
Awesome.

2127
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,928
You suck at everything!

2128
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,401
Boo-Boo.

2129
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:24,091
Great teamwork, guys.

2130
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,525
How long have you
two been married?

2131
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,364
Eight years.
Ten years.

2132
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,851
Ten years.
Eight.

2133
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,644
Very long time.
A very long time.

2134
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,088
Did you see the
look on her face? DANNY: Yes.

2135
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,322
Do you understand
what joy that brought me?

2136
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,765
How about the
look on her face

2137
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,080
when you were doing
the juggling, though?

2138
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,491
The juggling was
the highlight for me.

2139
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,050
That was pretty good.
You liked that?

2140
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,201
It was so cute.

2141
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:44,567
And when you talked about
her arms getting done?

2142
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,324
The good news is
she's beating the hell

2143
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,640
out of the iPod
guy right now.

2144
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:48,847
Right now, I know.

2145
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,442
That was good.
That was really fun.

2146
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,120
You know what, I think
that was the first time

2147
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,645
that you and I have ever

2148
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,969
gone out, you
know, just us.

2149
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,491
I know. I do.

2150
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,164
I feel bad for
the Soul Patch now.

2151
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,881
I do.

2152
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:07,450
Now that you've been
out with a real man.

2153
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,921
And by a real man,
I mean a man who showers.

2154
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,931
I think it's
so adorable

2155
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,446
how obsessed you
are with this guy.

2156
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,807
I just can't picture you guys on
a date, you know what I mean?

2157
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,644
Who said it was
a date ever?

2158
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,171
You.
You.

2159
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,448
You get very excited
when you talk to this man.

2160
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,571
Listen, Dr. Gervitz is moving
his practice to New York City.

2161
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,687
Yeah.

2162
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:33,286
Brian is not gonna go
with him, and he...

2163
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,166
He's just been
asking me if

2164
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:40,203
I would want to,
you know, replace him.

2165
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,006
You're going?

2166
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:43,841
No.

2167
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:45,651
You can't do that to me.

2168
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,802
I just wanted to see
how you'd react.

2169
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,201
Look at you.
You can't live without me.

2170
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,725
"What do I do?
How do I sign it?

2171
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,165
"How do I pay for it?"

2172
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,084
No. You kind of played
with me a little bit, though.

2173
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,885
You could've told
me that earlier.

2174
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,405
You're just
messing with me?

2175
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,244
Trying to get me a little
jealous, weren't you?

2176
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,210
No. I just was having
fun teasing you.

2177
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,840
That was fun. Why?
Were you jealous?

2178
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,688
No. Get outta here.
Was I jealous? No.

2179
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,481
Look at you. You're grinning, you
can't stop, what is that smile?

2180
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,005
I didn't know you
had that many teeth.

2181
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,845
I know.
I got like 55 teeth.

2182
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:23,524
No. So there's nothing?

2183
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,247
You and...
There's nothing?

2184
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,721
No love connection?

2185
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,167
No. Mmm-mmm. Nothing.

2186
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,288
Well, then,
that's a shame.

2187
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,527
What?

2188
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,606
That coconut getting
in the way tonight.

2189
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,046
That's a shame, don't you think?
Oh.

2190
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,804
No.
No, that was bad.

2191
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,007
The coconut.

2192
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,241
You're lucky that
coconut was there.

2193
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,370
You couldn't...
You wouldn't have been able to handle it.

2194
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,250
Maybe you're right.

2195
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,045
You got more tricks that
I don't know about?

2196
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,326
I don't know.

2197
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,601
Okay.

2198
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,007
I don't know anything.

2199
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,767
Mommy?
Mommy?

2200
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:03,165
Hi, guys!

2201
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,044
Hey! What're you doing?

2202
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:07,009
The babysitter
fell asleep.

2203
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,281
Oh, great.

2204
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:09,566
I mean, come on,

2205
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,290
it's like a Hawaiian
Rosa,huh?

2206
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,451
Is it?
Oh, my God.

2207
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,726
Yeah, that's asleep.

2208
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:15,926
LOOK at that.

2209
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,289
Wow.
She's out deep.

2210
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,930
All right.
Good to see you guys.

2211
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,491
Good night.

2212
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,001
Good job. One more
day of lying, guys.

2213
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,969
We're almost done.
Home stretch.

2214
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,851
All right. So, you
gotta go to sleep.

2215
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:34,481
Yeah.

2216
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,443
Tired?
Yes. Good night.

2217
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,284
Okay. That was fun.
Good job.

2218
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,850
Good night.
Good night.

2219
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,810
Good night.
All right.

2220
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:45,007
Okay, Danny.

2221
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,642
Okay, good luck.
I'll see you in the morning.

2222
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,122
She ain't going to sleep.

2223
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:25,521
Hello!
There he is, Danny!

2224
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:26,841
It's nice to meet you.

2225
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:28,126
Where were
you going?

2226
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:29,287
What?

2227
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,249
I was going...
I was going to...

2228
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,401
Where were you guys?

2229
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:33,686
I was looking
for you guys at...

2230
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,365
What happened?
How was the dinner?

2231
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,047
Dolph gave mouth-
to-mouth to a sheep.

2232
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,645
Yeah. And then
we had a few drinks.

2233
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:45,925
Yes. It was choking and
so I gave him sheep-P-R.

2234
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:50,371
But he was the black
sheep of the family,

2235
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:54,570
but he was also white,
if that makes any sense.

2236
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,846
And we've been talking about
now amazing this trip has been

2237
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,809
and how amazing you are.

2238
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,450
Yeah, all joking aside,

2239
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,249
it really has
been first-class.

2240
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,444
And that, if the kids and I
hadn't kept you so busy,

2241
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,602
that you might've had
the time to do something

2242
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,444
you've been thinking
about doing?

2243
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:12,602
The one ringy-dingy?

2244
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:15,726
Uh... Yeah, you told
her about that?

2245
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:18,846
I don't need you
to get me a ring, Danny.

2246
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:21,281
Let's just get married.
Right here.

2247
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,886
What now?

2248
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,681
Why not? We're in Hawaii.
Let's do it tomorrow.

2249
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,811
I mean, this has felt special
from the moment that we met.

2250
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,848
And I've seen the way
that you are with the kids,

2251
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:34,685
and it's exactly the way I always
imagined my husband would be.

2252
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,649
Oh, man...

2253
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,803
I don't wanna wait.

2254
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,769
I just wanna start
my life with you.

2255
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,486
Hi!

2256
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,208
Hi, everybody!
Dolph.

2257
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:52,681
There you are.

2258
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,842
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

2259
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,561
For me? Yes. Come here.
Come on, let's go.

2260
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,722
No way, we can't go.
What?

2261
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:02,404
My little
Oompa Loompa.

2262
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:07,561
Danny and Palmer, they're
getting married tomorrow!

2263
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:10,126
What?

2264
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,850
No, no, I mean, why?

2265
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,082
Yeah, we are.
But what do you think?

2266
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,083
What do you mean,
what do I think?

2267
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,164
I mean, what does it
matter what I think?

2268
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,891
I think that's great.

2269
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,610
Thank you, Devlin.

2270
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,684
I really hope that you
can be there tomorrow.

2271
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:26,246
I can't.

2272
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:28,090
It's really...

2273
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:31,130
It's bad luck for the ex
to be at the wedding.

2274
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,446
Come on, Dolph.
Let's go.

2275
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,570
Where are we going?
They are here.

2276
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,801
We gotta have the sweet sex.

2277
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,325
What?
Okay? Come on.

2278
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:40,165
Okay.
Congratulations, though.

2279
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,170
I'm trying them
on as we speak.

2280
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,560
I know, but
I just bought them.

2281
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,520
I had some with me and the one
I have on is pretty amazing.

2282
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,807
Michael!

2283
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,571
Nincompoop!

2284
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,769
Nincompoopenschtic!

2285
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:23,605
Michael, the crap
is the stinking...

2286
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,640
Hello?

2287
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:42,529
Hey, you up?

2288
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,721
Hi. Yeah.
Glad you called.

2289
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,120
Are you?

2290
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,127
Um...

2291
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,044
Yeah, I was, uh,
just checking flights

2292
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:57,602
for your parents
tomorrow and I found...

2293
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,201
No,no,no.
You don't have to do that.

2294
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,410
Her parents
aren't coming in

2295
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,960
and she wants it
to be kind of elope-y.

2296
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:06,965
Elope-y.

2297
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:08,801
Got it.

2298
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,848
Okay, uh, so,
are you all set

2299
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,922
for what you need
to wear tomorrow?

2300
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:16,206
Do you think this
is a good idea?

2301
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,888
What? The wedding?

2302
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:23,325
Yeah, the wedding...
Just the whole Palmer thing.

2303
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,328
Well, that's why
we came out here, right?

2304
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,490
I guess.

2305
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:34,170
You don't think
it's crazy?

2306
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:42,644
Um, Danny, you don't
need my permission.

2307
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:45,962
Okay?
You're a big boy.

2308
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,690
I know, I just...

2309
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,241
I know if
I do this that...

2310
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:58,209
Just, things
could get weird

2311
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,607
between you and
me at the office, so...

2312
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:04,211
Well, you're not gonna have
to worry about that.

2313
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:08,363
You going to New York?

2314
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:11,569
Yeah. I just,
you know, I mean...

2315
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:15,044
As much as I was
looking forward to you, um,

2316
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,281
reconstructing my face,

2317
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,730
I really just need to
start fresh, you know?

2318
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,323
Hello, are you there?

2319
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:29,850
You understand?

2320
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,530
I guess.

2321
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,884
It's an awful lot of guessing
coming through this phone.

2322
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,209
I've been divorced,
I have two kids,

2323
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,243
I don't have time
for guessing.

2324
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,644
Got a big day tomorrow,
Doc, all right?

2325
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,644
So why don't you just
get yourself some sleep?

2326
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,208
So that's it. You have
nothing else to worry about.

2327
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,408
We have the flowers,
the music and the location,

2328
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,841
which is ha-wowie, by the way,
you're gonna love it.

2329
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,128
I promise you
it is going to be

2330
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:18,170
the most wonderful day
of your life, guaranteed.

2331
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,164
Devlin.
Yeah.

2332
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:21,526
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...

2333
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,524
Well, you just look
absolutely beautiful.

2334
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,043
Really? Thank you.
Yes.

2335
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,290
Devlin, can I ask
you something?

2336
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,441
'Course.

2337
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:38,688
Do you still want
to be with Danny?

2338
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,327
Wait. What?

2339
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,050
Because I think that

2340
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,043
he still may be
in love with you.

2341
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:50,760
Really?

2342
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,962
Why would you think that?

2343
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,449
He's always glowing
when you're around.

2344
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,888
And he laughs at your jokes.
He doesn't laugh at mine.

2345
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:06,443
Palmer, trust me, there is
nothing between me and Danny.

2346
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:08,484
We're just, you know,

2347
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,291
we're familiar.

2348
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,484
And you are
the girl for him.

2349
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,970
He even told me
that last night.

2350
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:19,604
My God, Devlin,
this is such a relief

2351
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,607
because I could never stand a
chance going up against you.

2352
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,643
Turn around.
Tell me if this fits.

2353
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,888
Put the hanger
up your nose.

2354
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,086
Stop!

2355
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:41,366
Excuse me.

2356
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,931
Here you go.
Thank you.

2357
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:44,366
Katherine!

2358
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:46,011
Katherine!
Oh, Devlin.

2359
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,844
That was so much
fun last night.

2360
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,967
I know.

2361
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:52,364
I am still trying to work
out how you cheated.

2362
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,446
I didn't.
That's what happened.

2363
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:57,847
So, where's Danny?

2364
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,206
Devlin...

2365
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,004
Danny's at his wedding.

2366
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,641
Come again?

2367
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:08,365
I was never
married to him.

2368
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,529
All a big lie
that I made up.

2369
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:12,960
Why?

2370
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:18,162
'Cause I couldn't stand the
thought of you knowing the truth.

2371
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:19,321
Really?

2372
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,525
So,yeah,
I'm a single mother.

2373
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,610
I have two kids
that I love

2374
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:26,045
more than anything
in the world.

2375
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:30,125
I drive a Honda.
Still have dial-up internet.

2376
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,406
I got a 2.7 GPA
in college, not a 3.4.

2377
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,400
And while I'm at
it telling the truth,

2378
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:38,605
I named my kids'
poop after you.

2379
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:43,166
And I work for Danny.
I'm his assistant.

2380
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:44,401
That's it.

2381
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,168
Really, I would never
have guessed this.

2382
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:50,049
I mean, you two had
a real connection.

2383
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:54,722
He's great.
He's the greatest guy.

2384
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,331
And I might even
be in love with him,

2385
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:02,328
but that doesn't really
matter at this moment

2386
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:06,809
because he is getting married
to another person right now.

2387
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,923
Ian and I are breaking up.

2388
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,929
What? What happened?

2389
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,442
Well, for starters,
he's gay.

2390
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:19,681
He's gay?

2391
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,364
I mean, look at him.

2392
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,488
That's a strong
muscle right there.

2393
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:25,085
I'm squeezing.

2394
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,045
Devlin,
I gotta tell you,

2395
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,010
last night, with the ass
grab of the coconut,

2396
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,082
little bit of a red flag.

2397
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,808
I've seen him do
that with the soap.

2398
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,085
What about the iPod?

2399
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,969
Oh, he didn't
invent shit.

2400
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:47,246
He didn't?

2401
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:50,011
No! He made his money
suing the Dodgers

2402
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,242
after he got hit
by a foul ball.

2403
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:56,962
Oh, God!
That's so... What?

2404
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,644
Well, this is different.

2405
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:04,721
Yeah, why didn't we try this
truth-telling thing before?

2406
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,560
I don't know.

2407
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,284
Hey.
Hey.

2408
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,527
What?

2409
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:12,886
That's nice.

2410
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:15,167
It's nice to tell
the truth. That's good.

2411
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,765
The truth is
fun, isn't it?

2412
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,285
Like, were you
telling the truth

2413
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,089
when you said you might
be in love with me?

2414
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,649
I'm gonna leave you two.
Okay.

2415
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,689
I'm gonna go get a divorce.
Good luck.

2416
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:32,640
Wait, where
are my kids?

2417
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:35,487
Palmer took them
out for ice cream.

2418
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,601
So, how was the wedding?

2419
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,011
Okay. All right.

2420
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:44,125
So, we're standing on top of
this beautiful cliff. Uh-huh.

2421
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:47,409
I start looking out
into the Pacific,

2422
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:49,130
and I think to myself,

2423
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:53,967
"Wow. I am about
to start my life

2424
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:56,090
"with the one I love."

2425
01:46:57,880 --> 01:46:59,848
And the only problem was,

2426
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,321
the one I love
was not with me.

2427
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:04,761
She wasn't?

2428
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,046
She was not.

2429
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,849
So you didn't?

2430
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,206
I couldn't.

2431
01:47:10,280 --> 01:47:11,520
You couldn't.

2432
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,489
I mean, don't we
have something extra

2433
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,891
happening with us?

2434
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,250
Danny, I...

2435
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:26,882
What happens when
we're not on fake-cation

2436
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,163
and you wake up
and realize this is real?

2437
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:33,244
You are the only real thing
I've ever had in my life.

2438
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:35,562
Danny, come on,
man. I don't...

2439
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,843
She's beautiful and she's...
I'm not twenty-three.

2440
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,562
I'm not that.

2441
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,649
She's good,
she's very nice,

2442
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:47,405
there's only one problem.
She's not you.

2443
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:48,761
She's not you.

2444
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:51,444
I have two kids.

2445
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,082
I can't just drive them
off a cliff. You Know?

2446
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,846
I love those kids

2447
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:58,968
more than anything
in the world, Guv'nor.

2448
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:04,008
No, I wanna be with those
guys like 23 hours a clay.

2449
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:06,243
What about the other hour?

2450
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,965
Good job!

2451
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:20,690
That's what I'm
talking about.

2452
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:22,125
Whatever!

2453
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,040
Well,
everything turned out

2454
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,282
pretty good
for everybody.

2455
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,404
Squirt got to swim
with the dolphins.

2456
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,848
Palmer met some tennis player her
own age on the plane ride home,

2457
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,321
who's an even bigger
fan of 'N Sync.

2458
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:46,646
And Maggie's about to start
a three-week acting class

2459
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,927
with the actual
Dolph Lundgren.

2460
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,003
And what happened
for me?

2461
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:55,489
Well, I'm finally wearing
my wedding ring for real.

2462
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:57,563
And now when
women ask me about it,

2463
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,842
I'm gonna tell them
I'm married to a woman

2464
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,651
who doesn't beat me,
doesn't cheat on me,

2465
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:05,764
doesn't drink...
Well, doesn't drink that much.

2466
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,730
And who I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

2467
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,565
A woman named Katherine.

2468
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:14,928
Would you like to dance with
your wife, Doctor Maccabee?

2469
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:17,242
Yes, I would,
Mrs. Maccabee.

2470
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,601
Yeah, it's okay.

2471
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,371
One more.

2472
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,690
You were right, Soul Patch
is going hard on that bass.

2473
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,444
What did I tell you?
Uh-huh.

2474
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:38,201
Hey. Encore, man.
I'm just kidding. Stop.

2475
01:49:43,320 --> 01:49:45,527
I get it. It is long
and it's gross.

2476
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:48,371
You don't need wind for
that thing to swing around.

2477
01:49:49,305 --> 01:50:49,205
