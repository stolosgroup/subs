00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,120
They called him Machete.

3
00:00:56,206 --> 00:01:00,751
Seventy dollars a day for
yard work, a hundred for roofing.

4
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,128
Get in.

5
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:09,134
- One-twenty-five for septic. Sewage.
- Have you ever killed anyone before?

6
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:13,222
As you may know, illegal aliens,
such as yourself,

7
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:16,100
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate.

8
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:21,355
For the good of both our people...
our new senator must die.

9
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,652
And for that,
I will pay you $150,000... cash.

10
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:29,530
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.

11
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:34,785
I cost the most......
because I'm the best there is.

12
00:01:44,462 --> 00:01:48,924
Set up,
double-crossed and left for dead.

13
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:54,722
I took a vow of peace, and now you
want me to help you kill all these men?

14
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:56,098
Yes, bro.

15
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,684
I mean, Padre.

16
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,520
I'll see what I can do.

17
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,363
He knows the score.

18
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:13,991
Where are my wife and daughter?

19
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:16,827
He gets the women.

20
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:18,370
♪ He's bad

21
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:19,872
♪ Machete ♪

22
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,751
- And he kills the bad guys..
- No!

23
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,629
Oh, shit.

24
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:32,468
You mean that a Mexican
day laborer is a goddamn Federale?

25
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,887
- But they soon realized...

26
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,138
He's coming after us.

27
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:41,060
...they just fucked
with the wrong Mexican.

28
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,397
- Action...

29
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:50,402
-...suspense...

30
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,865
-...emotion.
- Please, Father, have mercy.

31
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,951
God has mercy. I don't.

32
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:03,499
If you're gonna hire Machete
to kill the bad guy,

33
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:08,754
you'd better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.

34
00:03:13,051 --> 00:03:14,551
Machete.

35
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,054
Rated X.

36
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,060
Brought to you from your friends
at the Weinstein Company.

37
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,154
You're real pretty tonight, Holly.

38
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:05,991
Goddamn it, girls! If you're gonna
do that shit, do it on stage!

39
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:10,329
Smoking hot. Phew.

40
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:17,085
Cherry Darling,
I told you too many fucking times,

41
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,087
you can't be up there crying
and all that shit.

42
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,757
Do you know what a go-go dance is?

43
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,761
- Useless talent number 12?
- No, it's a happy dance.

44
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,848
Get up there and you dance happy.
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

45
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,850
I'm quitting.

46
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:33,727
You say that
at least one night a week.

47
00:07:34,437 --> 00:07:40,359
I mean it this time..
I need a dramatic change in my life.

48
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,319
I've always said you're funny,

49
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:44,780
but if you don't stop crying,
I'm gonna fire your ass.

50
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,949
I don't want to fire your ass
because I like looking at your ass.

51
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,744
"Any girl leaving early
must check out with their finger

52
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:53,413
and have a bye-bye slip."

53
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,708
Here's my finger.

54
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,963
And here's my bye-bye slip.

55
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,258
We need some cash.

56
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:29,157
Dick! Fuck!

57
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:33,829
Aah!

58
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,961
Ass-bag!

59
00:08:45,883 --> 00:08:47,509
Ow!

60
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:06,403
All right, boys. Come on..

61
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,954
All right, all right. Come on.
You guys know the drill, huh?

62
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:22,377
Wait here, lieutenant. I'll handle this.

63
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,133
Hey, Abby.

64
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,929
I can see you've had
a spot of trouble, Romy.

65
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,309
Would you like to tell me what happened?

66
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,895
Uh, they escaped.

67
00:09:40,938 --> 00:09:42,397
All three?

68
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:47,360
Yeah. I don't know, uh... I don't know
how they did it. Just, they got out...

69
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:50,822
I'm sorry, Romy,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

70
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:53,450
And you know the rules.

71
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:58,038
Oh, no. I'm out. I swear, Abby,
you're not gonna see me anymore.

72
00:09:58,122 --> 00:09:59,873
- OK?
- Not so fast.

73
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:08,215
I also want your balls.

74
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:19,017
I'm really quite attached to them.

75
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:22,979
Oh, sweetheart.
I was really attached to my specimens.

76
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:26,691
And now they're out there
in the night doing God knows what.

77
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,152
I can't do it, Abby, please.
Please, Abby.

78
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:35,826
Hey, hey! What are you guys...?!

79
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,705
You son of a bitch, Abby! Listen!
You don't need Abby. There's more!

80
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,959
There's more!
I could get you all you ever need!

81
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,170
Motherfucking pussies!
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

82
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:52,217
I can get you more! No! No!

83
00:11:00,476 --> 00:11:01,893
Pick this up, please.

84
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,222
Where's the shit?

85
00:11:40,057 --> 00:11:44,186
The shit's right there.
The deal is still good.

86
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:47,939
No, it's not.

87
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,027
You held out on me.

88
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,112
Now I want all of it.

89
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,765
It looks like I got you
by the balls, Abby.

90
00:12:21,849 --> 00:12:24,726
- You certainly have.
- So...

91
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,606
... I'll ask you one more time.

92
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:32,192
Where's...

93
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,527
...the...

94
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,821
...shit?

95
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,491
Everywhere!

96
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:21,908
Oh, balls.

97
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,245
Get that thing away from my pumps!

98
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,126
It's just overheating!
I need to get to town.

99
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:17,964
It's just
a stripped radiator cap.

100
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:22,302
- Water leaks when it heats up.

101
00:14:24,472 --> 00:14:26,181
No pressure.

102
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:33,563
- Are you OK?
- I'm just cherry.

103
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,107
Go on and have a seat anywhere.
I'll be right in.

104
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,198
- Here, take this with you.
- Not your good spring water.

105
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,617
Ain't nothing good about it.
I bottle it myself.

106
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,243
I get it right there out of the dam.

107
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:53,666
- Thanks, JT.
- We're serving inside tonight.

108
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,086
Best barbeque in Texas round the clock.

109
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,214
- I gotta go.
- Saving lives, are ya?

110
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,342
Now how did you know that?

111
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,228
Now that's a rump roast.

112
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:22,654
I couldn't get off work this week.
But you only have to stay till ten.

113
00:15:24,907 --> 00:15:27,617
A friend will be here
before ten to pick up Tony.

114
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,453
♪ Going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge

115
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,580
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

116
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,833
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

117
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,337
There's a packed suitcase under his bed.

118
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,008
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

119
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,558
I'll leave him watching TV.

120
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:58,148
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes. Thank you.

121
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,319
- What happened to your tooth??
- Fell out.

122
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:07,740
Wow. Think you could say
a prayer for your old man?

123
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:14,289
- No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
- No dead bodies for Dad tonight. Amen.

124
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,832
Amen.

125
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:25,133
- Who was that you were talking to?
- Babysitter. She's on her way.

126
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,724
- You believe her?
- No.

127
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,350
Me neither.

128
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:04,422
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,883
- How's it going, JT?
- All right.

130
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,345
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah. All night.

131
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,473
- Free of charge.

132
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:17,018
Tonight is a special night.

133
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:22,023
- What's so special about tonight?
- Been open 25 years.

134
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,609
You're the second person
to show up tonight.

135
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:28,279
- Who's the first?
- Right there.

136
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:38,289
Must be passing through.
Seems only strangers eat here.

137
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,417
I still eat here, JT.

138
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:43,503
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

139
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,631
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you're eating.

140
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,141
Hello, Palomita.

141
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:01,896
I don't go by that name anymore.

142
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:07,735
So, you ever become
that fancy doctor?

143
00:18:10,281 --> 00:18:11,948
Never did.

144
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,038
Thought for sure you would.
You talked about it enough.

145
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:21,708
That's the problem with goals,
they become the thing you talk about

146
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,334
instead of the thing you do.

147
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:26,170
That's my jacket.

148
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:29,299
I looked for it for two weeks.

149
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:32,427
- How long did you look for me, Wray?
- Jacket belonged to me, you didn't.

150
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:38,224
So, um... what are you doing now?

151
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:42,478
I'm going to be a stand-up comedian.

152
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,065
Really?

153
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,695
You're not funny.

154
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:56,409
That's what I've been trying to tell
everybody, but they say I'm hysterical.

155
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:59,287
But you're not.

156
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:05,043
There's a difference between
being frank and being dick.

157
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:09,714
Yeah, well, it's really good
seeing you again.

158
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,467
Oh, um...

159
00:19:12,593 --> 00:19:16,220
...what name do you go by now? In case
I wanna catch one of your shows.

160
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,181
Cherry.

161
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:21,100
Cherry Darling.

162
00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:23,269
Sounds like a stripper.

163
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:27,231
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.
There's a difference.

164
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:29,609
Right.

165
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:33,946
Well... you'll always be
Palomita to me.

166
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,828
I need a ride.

167
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,334
What do you say El Wray?

168
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,214
I'll give you a ride.

169
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,052
Goodbye, Bill.

170
00:19:56,178 --> 00:19:58,638
- Don't you mean "See you later?"
- Of course.

171
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,850
Hey, what's up, doc?

172
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,688
Little lady's looking
pretty good there.

173
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:11,192
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river. I'm kidding.

174
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,903
- Look at that shit.
- What happened to your arm?

175
00:20:13,987 --> 00:20:18,491
- Well, uh... I got bit.
- Bit? Bit by what?

176
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:21,744
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

177
00:20:22,496 --> 00:20:24,038
Got some Bactine or something?

178
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:28,835
Ooh. Can't you just sew it up?

179
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:34,048
Well, normally, I would. I'd even be
doing something to stop the bleeding.

180
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:38,136
- Problem is, this one doesn't bleed.
- Oh, shit. Check this out.

181
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,849
At this old military hospital, this one
guy came back from Iraq with this.

182
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:46,018
Ooh, chronic herpetic lesions.

183
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:49,689
When he urinated it came out through
these holes here, like a fountain.

184
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:53,359
Oh, Jesus. How'd you treat it?

185
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,071
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.

186
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:00,199
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

187
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:03,619
I got Iraqi eyeballs a friend of mine
brought back to do some studies on.

188
00:21:03,704 --> 00:21:07,081
Incredible. They were
completely milked over, mustard gas.

189
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,584
Actually, I still have those
in my fridge.

190
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:14,839
- It's a botfly, you think?
- Chronic, viral, ulcerative lesion.

191
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:17,925
That looks like gout.

192
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,137
- He's running a temperature of 105.
- Is that bad?

193
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:24,432
- It's high.
- Bad would be 108.

194
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,852
You can have a seizure, go psychotic...

195
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,604
...and probably die.

196
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,064
- Say "ahh."
- Aah.

197
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:37,361
- Oh! Jesus!
- Oh, nice. Black abscess tongue.

198
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:40,531
All abscesses should be drained, period.

199
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:50,374
- What are you doing??
- Shut up, Joe.

200
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,222
- Baby, get the needles.

201
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:11,145
- Be right there.
- Right now.

202
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,064
Asshole.

203
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:21,447
It's spreading.

204
00:22:22,449 --> 00:22:23,533
Holy shit.

205
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:24,992
When did you say
you got this bite?

206
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,746
- Just now..
- We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

207
00:22:28,831 --> 00:22:32,208
- Lose the arm? What do you mean?
- It's spreading to your shoulder.

208
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:35,002
If we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

209
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,629
and we can't cut that off.

210
00:22:36,713 --> 00:22:38,923
Well, shouldn't I get a second opinion?

211
00:22:39,007 --> 00:22:40,675
Hi, Joe.

212
00:22:41,802 --> 00:22:44,512
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic

213
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,099
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure. These...

214
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:52,270
...are my friends. My yellow friend...

215
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,023
-...is just to take the sting off.
- Ah!

216
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,610
My blue friend... you'll barely feel.

217
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:04,574
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

218
00:23:04,658 --> 00:23:06,826
See how fast my friends work?

219
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:11,122
And after my red-headed friend...

220
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:14,292
...you'll never see me again.

221
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,926
They all react differently.

222
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:29,932
- Now what?

223
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:33,603
Dedicated to
Jungle Julia, in loving memory.

224
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:48,492
It's not the radiator.

225
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:50,995
Damn it!

226
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,227
Fucking thing. Cheap!

227
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,411
Hey! Hey, hey!

228
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:35,164
Bastard! Bastard!

229
00:24:47,844 --> 00:24:50,554
Hey! Hey!

230
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:53,849
- Get outta the road, bitch!

231
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:11,742
Stop! Stop!!
Please! Stop!

232
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,830
No! No!!

233
00:25:15,956 --> 00:25:18,749
No!

234
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:32,972
What the hell is that?

235
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:39,979
- People picking up roadkill.
- What, like an armadillo?

236
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,734
Deer. We get a lot of them around here.

237
00:25:45,902 --> 00:25:48,821
You know,
I read a statistic that said

238
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:53,784
that the eating of venison has risen
30 percent in the last few years.

239
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:56,037
Sixty percent of that's from roadkill.

240
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,081
People eat roadkill?

241
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,417
If you're driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

242
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,210
and a deer darts out in front of you,

243
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:07,923
if you blink or brake or swerve,
shit, you'll just kill yourself.

244
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:12,553
- So, what do you do?
- Pick 'em off. Just like this.

245
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,806
- Send it flying away from you.
- Unacceptable.

246
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Oh, fuck!

247
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,576
Cherry.

248
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:40,831
I thought you said if you saw a deer
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

249
00:26:40,916 --> 00:26:42,291
That wasn't a deer.

250
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:47,338
- Cherry! Cherry! No!

251
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,441
- Ah!

252
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,539
Palomita.

253
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,336
- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

254
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:31,382
Car accident, heavy contusions about
the torso, possible spinal trauma...

255
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:34,135
...one severed limb.

256
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,929
Where's the leg?

257
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:40,808
Three sickos attacked her.
I shot at them.

258
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,019
I never miss.

259
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,067
They took the leg with them.

260
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,081
You have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this.

261
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,542
- He has to sign her in.
- Do what now?

262
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:08,836
He's with her.
He's responsible for her.

263
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,505
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

264
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,261
What are you doing with a rifle, Wray?

265
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:20,806
Nothing. Was thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

266
00:28:20,891 --> 00:28:24,977
Come on, Wray. You know you're not
supposed to be doing that stuff anymore.

267
00:28:25,061 --> 00:28:27,938
Here I stick my neck out for ya.

268
00:28:28,023 --> 00:28:30,774
Now you've got a gal in your wrecked
truck with a missing leg?

269
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,652
A missing leg that's now missing?

270
00:28:33,737 --> 00:28:37,740
And here you're saying in front of
everybody someone up and snatched it?

271
00:28:37,824 --> 00:28:41,368
And that you shot them with a gun you
never should've had in the first place?

272
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,287
And that now they're gone?

273
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:45,414
Can we finish this conversation
somewhere else?

274
00:28:45,498 --> 00:28:47,166
My thought exactly.

275
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,212
Dr. Block,
three fresh ones rolling in.

276
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:55,049
- Christ, you're kidding.
- Automobile accident off Highway 18.

277
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,551
DOAs? Have Andy pick them up.

278
00:28:59,387 --> 00:29:03,933
- That's unsanitary, doc.
- Helps me monitor my state of calmness.

279
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:06,769
Don't get worked up enough to crack it.

280
00:29:06,853 --> 00:29:09,521
- Fuck!
- Might cut yourself pretty good.

281
00:29:09,606 --> 00:29:12,149
Then I would know I was not calm.

282
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,449
What do you say now, doc?

283
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,411
Somebody call my wife.

284
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:27,498
- Sheriff Hague.
- It's JT, sheriff.

285
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:29,625
JT, how's the barbecue business?

286
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,962
Ever since my bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

287
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:36,882
I'm real sorry to hear about that.
I wish there was something I could do.

288
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,218
Right now, I ain't calling
my brother, I'm calling the sheriff.

289
00:29:39,302 --> 00:29:41,679
I'm listening. What's the trouble?

290
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,722
There ain't no trouble,
not yet, anyway.

291
00:29:43,807 --> 00:29:46,600
I got two delinquents been
hanging around here for over an hour.

292
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,686
They won't purchase,
and they won't leave.

293
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:55,567
- Never mind, here they come.
- You cook that meat at 250 degrees?

294
00:29:55,652 --> 00:29:58,320
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

295
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:01,282
Give me that recipe or I'll raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

296
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:03,867
Brother, ain't no Texan's
ever gonna give you his BBQ recipe.

297
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:06,036
That's a fact.
He'll take it to his grave.

298
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:08,789
I could be bleeding like a stuck pig,
I ain't gonna tell ya.

299
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,959
I could be dying in your arms,
I ain't gonna tell ya.

300
00:30:12,085 --> 00:30:13,794
We'll see about that.

301
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,051
You gonna look,
or are you gonna eat?

302
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,188
- You called for me?
- I need for you to see this.

303
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:38,736
- Looks like a no-brainer..
- What does that mean?

304
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,990
No brain.
Scooped clean out of her skull.

305
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,369
I know what this is..
Don't tell me. Liquefactive necrosis.

306
00:30:48,705 --> 00:30:51,206
- You think??
- Oh, sure.

307
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,375
Thank you, that'll be all.

308
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,391
Did you know she was back in town?

309
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:12,936
No.

310
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:15,147
I didn't.

311
00:31:20,195 --> 00:31:22,279
What happened to her?

312
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,449
I don't know, baby.

313
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:32,748
I thought you stopped seeing each other.

314
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:37,419
We have.

315
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:40,255
Well, yes, you have now.
She's fucking dead.

316
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:44,134
I mean, we stopped before.

317
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,643
I haven't talked to her in a while.

318
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:59,441
But you've written each other?

319
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,863
Here and there.

320
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:06,698
But nothing...

321
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:08,117
What're you doing?!

322
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:11,703
Let me see your last three messages.

323
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,499
- You have no right.
- I don't?

324
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,336
I don't have a right?

325
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,173
Show it to me.

326
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:27,177
- Show it to me.
- No.

327
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,513
Ahh!

328
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:32,015
Now that's just to take the sting off.

329
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,689
- Show it to me.
- No, please.

330
00:32:39,482 --> 00:32:41,859
- Show it to me!

331
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,450
Now let's see how fast
your friends work.

332
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:01,545
That's pretty fast.

333
00:33:05,425 --> 00:33:08,427
Oh, what do I know, my love?

334
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,053
Exactly.

335
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:14,099
That you're a cheating, lying...

336
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,145
...sack.

337
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,524
- I didn't want to hurt you.
- But you did.

338
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:26,320
Because you're insane.

339
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:34,578
And I was afraid
of what you might do to me...

340
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,372
...to our son.

341
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:39,708
I'm the mother of your son.

342
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:41,919
Ah!

343
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,424
And after this one...

344
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:50,636
... I'll never see you again.

345
00:34:04,734 --> 00:34:07,277
- Dr. Block??
- What?

346
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:12,366
- You've gotta see this.
- I'll be right there.

347
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,045
Where the hell are the bodies?

348
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,173
That's what we wanted to show you.
They're gone.

349
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:31,593
They didn't just get up
and walk out, did they?

350
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,936
Shut the fuck up!
Somebody take care of this perp for me

351
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,690
- before I fucking kill him!
- What the hell is going on?

352
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,735
He was causing a ruckus
over at Skip's place, so I cuffed him,

353
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:32,779
and the son of a bitch,
he bit my goddamn finger off!

354
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,616
Quit your hollering
and get yourself a goddamn Band-Aid.

355
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,828
I'm not exaggerating, using colorful
speech. He bit my finger clean off!

356
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,372
Fucking shit!

357
00:35:42,457 --> 00:35:46,084
Get out there and book him. I'll
fucking kill him if I have to do it.

358
00:35:46,169 --> 00:35:47,711
Carlos, go get him.

359
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,715
Wray, you stay put.

360
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:17,491
- Are you sure he's in there?
- He was.

361
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,910
Motherfucker.

362
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:53,735
He's gone.

363
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:57,364
- Broke out the window.
- Where's my finger?

364
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,866
Found your ring.

365
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,786
Could it be the same guy
as your leg snatcher?

366
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,247
I didn't get a good look at mine.

367
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,169
That him over there?

368
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:06,266
Wray!

369
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:19,321
Fuck.

370
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,452
You motherfucker!

371
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:59,528
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

372
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:02,405
- He's infected.
- With what?

373
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,533
- Everything.
- Wray!

374
00:39:04,617 --> 00:39:06,201
Drop the fucking gun.

375
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,043
Where the fuck do you
think you're going?

376
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:19,714
- I'm gonna go get Cherry.
- Fine, but we're taking my car.

377
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:28,640
I'm riding with you.

378
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,851
Don't make any sudden moves.

379
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:43,697
- Viral infections.

380
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:48,368
They came pouring in.

381
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:53,290
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions. Highly contagious.

382
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:59,004
- What do you think?
- Self-preservation comes to mind.

383
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:01,548
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

384
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,176
First, let me get my wife.

385
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:17,540
I love you, sweetie. There you go,
bunny rabbit. Come on, come on.

386
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:19,292
Open up now.

387
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,544
I want you to be around for a while.

388
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:24,297
I don't want you checking out just...

389
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,925
Damn!

390
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,136
Ramona...

391
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:34,474
...you fart like a goddamn pack mule
since I've been back, goddamn!

392
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:38,812
Hate to do this to you, Earl!!
But we need every man on the job!

393
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,355
The shit has hit the fan!

394
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:43,775
Bring some guns and ammo!

395
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:45,527
Meet me at my brother's!

396
00:41:45,611 --> 00:41:48,154
I gotcha. I'll be there.

397
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:51,741
You gotta eat quick, sweetie.
Come on.

398
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,330
Oh, my.

399
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,962
Ah!

400
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,125
Oh, my God.

401
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,558
What the hell is going on?

402
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:47,565
- Are you gonna give me a gun?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

403
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,593
Palomita?

404
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,766
- Get up. We're leaving.
- I can't walk.

405
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:06,019
So what? Get up!

406
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,146
Get...

407
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,900
Motherfucker! Look at me!

408
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:14,777
Look at me!

409
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:19,866
I was gonna be a stand-up comedian.
Who's gonna laugh now?

410
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,744
Some of the best jokes
are about cripples. Let's go.

411
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:26,539
- It's not funny. It's pathetic.
- Would you stop crying over fucking...

412
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:29,000
-...spilt milk?!
- I have no leg!

413
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:40,803
Now you do. What do you think?

414
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:50,730
- You could carry me, Wray.
- Yeah? You never wanted that before.

415
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,065
Why start now?

416
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,653
Ahh!

417
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,996
This is fucking ridiculous.

418
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:15,505
The sheriff must've taken
the others to JT's. Get in!

419
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,013
Goddamn it, wait for me.

420
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:38,611
- My leg's stuck in the door.
- It's just wood.

421
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:41,656
- It's splintering!
- Will you just leave it alone?

422
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,658
Why is this happening to me?

423
00:46:43,742 --> 00:46:47,620
Just do me a favor right now
and just stay strong.

424
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,707
Stay?

425
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:53,543
Yeah, baby, stay.

426
00:46:57,006 --> 00:46:59,048
OK, my name is Electra. Fucking listen.

427
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,056
It's furry..

428
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:09,684
It's a furry one.

429
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:14,355
El for Electra, Ame from Amelia.
Does that make any fucking sense?

430
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,943
You can call me whatever the fuck
you want. I don't give a shit.

431
00:47:25,034 --> 00:47:26,617
- You said ten!!
- I'm sorry.

432
00:47:26,702 --> 00:47:28,786
We can't be watching your kid
all goddamned night!

433
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,497
Your friend never showed up,
and we got shit to do!

434
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,957
That's right.

435
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,834
Then start doing it.

436
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:44,052
Tony! We're leaving!

437
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:48,765
- Wait, my tarantula.
- Bring it, let's go.

438
00:47:49,308 --> 00:47:52,477
And my turtle. And my scorpion.

439
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:55,938
We're not octopuses.
We can't carry everything.

440
00:47:56,023 --> 00:48:00,318
- Octopi.
- Come on! Let's go.

441
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:10,870
Tony, what did I tell you? You can't
bring them all. Didn't I tell you that?

442
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,414
It's OK. They can live in the same tank.

443
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:17,168
- What about my pocket bike?
- It's in the trunk.

444
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,297
Where you think you're going,
you fucking bitch?!

445
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,676
We're gonna fucking kill you!

446
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:34,685
We're gonna kill you, bitch!

447
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,404
Are you sure you wanna do this?

448
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,118
Everybody grab a badge and a gun.
You're all deputies,

449
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:53,871
as of this moment forward,
except for you, Wray.

450
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:03,589
Nope.

451
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:07,552
- What do we got?
- Something's wrong up there.

452
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,056
JT always comes out and greets.
Let's go!

453
00:49:14,476 --> 00:49:16,769
Try not to shoot yourselves.

454
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,897
Don't shoot each other.

455
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,275
But especially...

456
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:26,404
...don't shoot me.

457
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:34,912
JT!

458
00:49:42,337 --> 00:49:44,589
Go on! Get off him, Rusty!

459
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,053
Goddamn, JT.

460
00:49:52,806 --> 00:49:54,265
Yah!

461
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:58,311
Ehh!

462
00:50:01,899 --> 00:50:04,734
- Barbeque?

463
00:50:05,986 --> 00:50:07,403
Asshole.

464
00:50:09,948 --> 00:50:13,618
- Damn good sausage link, JT.
- Best in Texas.

465
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:16,245
Must've passed out
after I killed those things.

466
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,207
Nice shooting.

467
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:22,793
Everybody, gather up supplies.
We head out in 20.

468
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,487
I want you to open that for Mommy.

469
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:55,159
Now, take the gun.

470
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,703
Careful.

471
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:02,291
And if anyone
comes to the door that isn't me,

472
00:51:02,376 --> 00:51:04,293
I want you to shoot them, OK?

473
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:08,339
I'm not kidding, Tony.
You shoot them.

474
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:10,383
Just like your video games.

475
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,469
You shoot them in the head.

476
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:15,137
What if it's Dad?

477
00:51:15,931 --> 00:51:18,015
Especially if it's your dad.

478
00:51:29,987 --> 00:51:32,905
And be careful
where you point that thing.

479
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,325
You'll blow your own face off.
I'll be right back.

480
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:38,744
I love you.

481
00:51:57,973 --> 00:52:00,725
Tony!

482
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,022
Hello, baby.

483
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,705
Open!

484
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:30,254
Look what you did to our son!

485
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,264
Stay away!

486
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:47,605
Goddamn it, I told you
I didn't want to see you again.

487
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:48,856
Daddy!

488
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:55,071
Get your sorry ass in here!

489
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,743
If it's escape vehicles you want,
escape vehicles I got.

490
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,411
Right this way.

491
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,205
Watch that meat!

492
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:05,581
Meet my wife.

493
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,585
Jesse James custom Dominator.

494
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,962
I made Jesse a plate
of barbeque so good,

495
00:53:12,047 --> 00:53:14,507
he made this baby for me
free of fucking charge.

496
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:17,259
Got anything that could
transport more people?

497
00:53:18,845 --> 00:53:22,640
- Where's the top?
- Baby's chopped permanently.

498
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:24,809
Ain't got no roll bar,
chicken wire, none of that shit.

499
00:53:24,893 --> 00:53:26,894
- No protection.
- And she's fast.

500
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:30,022
Nitrous injected, 350 horsepower engine.

501
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:34,735
Who are you? I mean really.
Wray's Wreckage?

502
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,279
That's what it says on your truck.

503
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,286
Are you a wrecker, Wray?

504
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:47,164
I'm nobody.

505
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:49,583
It's the easiest thing to remember.

506
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:52,628
So remember it.

507
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,179
Hey, you want some barbeque?

508
00:54:02,264 --> 00:54:05,391
- Best in Texas.
- Aw, no thanks.

509
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,853
- What's the matter? You don't eat meat?
- Oh, I eat meat.

510
00:54:08,937 --> 00:54:11,230
I also eat lots of shit.

511
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:14,150
- See this?
- What's that?

512
00:54:14,234 --> 00:54:16,652
Shit-eating grin.

513
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:19,238
You ought to be a comedian.

514
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,491
- What do you think of the leg?
- Oh, that's funny.

515
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:25,995
How's your stump?

516
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,081
They knocked it out something fierce.
Still can't feel a thing.

517
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:33,169
This must be the real Bone Shack.

518
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:39,675
- Old JT knows how to live.
- Like fuck he does.

519
00:54:43,388 --> 00:54:47,016
- I like how you say "fuck."
- Good. Fuck you.

520
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:50,352
Fuck me?

521
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,110
Oh, so now you're the comedian.
Go ahead. Drop your pants.

522
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:00,321
That'll be good for a laugh.

523
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:02,865
I highly doubt that.

524
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:13,042
- That's my jacket.
- Yes, I know.

525
00:55:13,126 --> 00:55:15,336
I looked for it for two weeks.

526
00:55:16,129 --> 00:55:20,007
Look, you were being
an unbelievable dick.

527
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:22,301
I was walking out on you.

528
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:25,638
I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

529
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:29,600
So if you're gonna go on one of your
psycho, obsessive controlling rants

530
00:55:29,684 --> 00:55:31,560
about a jacket, then fucking take it.

531
00:55:31,645 --> 00:55:34,730
'Cause I'd rather fucking freeze than
fucking hear about it one more time.

532
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:39,860
- Did you find what was in the pocket?
- Fuck no.

533
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,404
Look for it.

534
00:55:45,492 --> 00:55:47,326
No, the other one.

535
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:59,088
I was gonna give it to you,
but you left me.

536
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,883
You took the jacket.

537
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:05,928
And I looked for it
for two weeks.

538
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:09,598
Read it.

539
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,108
"Two against the world."

540
00:56:21,528 --> 00:56:23,654
Remember that?

541
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:26,532
I never forgot it.

542
00:56:27,409 --> 00:56:29,159
Why'd you leave?

543
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,956
Because you didn't
believe in us or in me.

544
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:59,083
I figured one of the new deputies
might end up shooting me,

545
00:57:59,167 --> 00:58:02,169
- but not you, Tolo!
- Sorry! I'm sorry.

546
00:58:02,253 --> 00:58:04,129
- Dumb-ass.
- You're gonna be all right.

547
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,383
McGraw is here
and a whole bunch of others.

548
00:58:08,009 --> 00:58:12,304
Come on! Move your ass! Come on!

549
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,574
What did I tell you, Tony?

550
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:35,411
Don't point the gun at yourself.

551
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:38,539
Didn't I tell you that?

552
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:43,293
Thank you for telling me about...
you know.

553
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:46,547
Don't mention it.
That's an order.

554
00:58:47,215 --> 00:58:48,799
If I had known that you were...

555
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:55,764
...El Wray, I wouldn't have
given you such a hard time.

556
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:58,726
I didn't mean to be a prick about it.

557
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,020
"Need to know basis," that kind of shit.

558
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,479
Take this.

559
00:59:04,691 --> 00:59:06,608
Do what you do best.

560
00:59:08,528 --> 00:59:11,905
No, you're not.
Don't give him the gun.

561
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:15,451
Give him the gun, Tolo.

562
00:59:15,577 --> 00:59:17,202
Give him that gun.

563
00:59:18,455 --> 00:59:19,955
Give him all the guns.

564
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:34,970
Holy shit.

565
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:39,641
That boy's got the devil in him.

566
00:59:43,104 --> 00:59:45,939
We gotta fight them off.
Get to our vehicles.

567
00:59:46,024 --> 00:59:47,191
- All right..
- All right.

568
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,401
Everyone behind me.

569
01:00:00,705 --> 01:00:02,331
Outside, now!

570
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:22,392
Goddamn you!

571
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:37,699
Everybody back inside!

572
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:46,375
You, Skip, front and center.

573
01:00:47,502 --> 01:00:50,129
Go out front, start up the Kill Dozer.

574
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,339
We need it to transport
the other survivors.

575
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:54,842
You fucking crazy?
I'm not going out there.

576
01:00:54,926 --> 01:00:57,553
- I'll cover you.
- I'm not going.

577
01:00:57,637 --> 01:01:01,348
- I never miss.
- Come on, Skip.

578
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:04,268
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

579
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,854
Cherry!

580
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:18,991
Oh, dear.

581
01:02:06,539 --> 01:02:09,291
JT! You take whoever you can fit
in your convertible!

582
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:10,709
Everyone else on board!

583
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:14,713
- Skip, grab the twins! Come on with me!
- You take the chopper.

584
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:18,133
- I need someone else to drive my truck!
- I'll do it.

585
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,554
You're bleeding like a stuck pig,
your vision is blurred,

586
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,140
- and you're on your last leg.
- Anything else?

587
01:02:25,225 --> 01:02:26,808
Don't wreck it.

588
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,772
Somebody grab the slaw. It ain't
no barbeque without coleslaw!

589
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:33,482
- I need a gun!
- Take this.

590
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,484
Fucking cool!

591
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,529
All right, y'all, head out.
I'll hold 'em off.

592
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:44,117
I can take care of myself.

593
01:02:44,744 --> 01:02:45,786
Bye, daddy.

594
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,206
Remember how to ride a bike?

595
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:52,042
Useless talent number 32.

596
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:55,295
Good. Anyone else have a car?

597
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,135
You sure you're OK driving this thing?

598
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,512
Hell, yeah.

599
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:09,017
Dakota! We're sorry about Tony.

600
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:11,270
Thanks.

601
01:03:11,896 --> 01:03:14,606
You're engine is shot
and you've got three blown tires.

602
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,566
But I've got
a pocket bike in the trunk.

603
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:22,114
- Is it fast?
- Zero to 50 in four seconds.

604
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,740
You ride with her.

605
01:03:25,076 --> 01:03:28,453
- I'm Cherry.
- You sure are.

606
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,039
Move out!

607
01:03:31,165 --> 01:03:33,041
Damn shame.

608
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:08,702
- Rusty!

609
01:04:08,828 --> 01:04:11,413
- Goddamn it!

610
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:51,828
Sheriff, how much ammo we got?

611
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:55,624
Not enough.

612
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,972
Don't shoot! We're not infected!

613
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:22,150
All survivors gotta come with us.

614
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:25,320
Especially you...

615
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,906
...El Wray.

616
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,158
I don't go by that name anymore.

617
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:47,175
It's OK. It's OK.

618
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,596
We're here in quarantine
with the other survivors.

619
01:06:01,441 --> 01:06:03,066
Where is here?

620
01:06:03,943 --> 01:06:06,445
The old Army base.

621
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,989
El Wray?

622
01:06:10,491 --> 01:06:11,783
That you?

623
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,745
He's with them.
I saw him in their convoy earlier.

624
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:19,791
I'm a scientist and a businessman.
Not military.

625
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:23,378
Which is why he's gonna tell us
what the fuck is going on.

626
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:27,382
They're stealing biochemical weapons.

627
01:06:27,467 --> 01:06:30,844
- DC-2?
- Also known as Project Terror.

628
01:06:32,138 --> 01:06:35,807
Designed to take out an entire populace
in a controlled, landlocked area.

629
01:06:35,892 --> 01:06:37,684
You were supplying it to them.

630
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:40,103
So why'd they shut you out?

631
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:43,732
They found my supply.
It's under our feet.

632
01:06:44,192 --> 01:06:45,650
Ten stories down.

633
01:06:45,776 --> 01:06:49,488
The only treatment is a regimented
exposure to DC-2, itself.

634
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,657
- Delays the negative effects.
- They need it.

635
01:06:53,659 --> 01:06:56,578
- Like a drug.
- Correct. We found that

636
01:06:56,662 --> 01:07:00,040
a small percentage of people
are not affected by the gas itself.

637
01:07:00,124 --> 01:07:02,375
And within this
small percentage lies a cure.

638
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,085
What do you want to do?

639
01:07:07,215 --> 01:07:08,757
Mexico.

640
01:07:08,841 --> 01:07:12,302
Put our backs against the ocean
and defend ourselves from there.

641
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:14,346
No. We have to get back to my lab.

642
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,848
This infection will spread
all over the world

643
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:20,519
to every man, woman and child,
unless I finish my antidote.

644
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,939
You have an antidote?

645
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,240
You! You! Come with us.

646
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:37,953
Move it! Move it, Peggy!

647
01:07:55,763 --> 01:08:00,016
- You like Ava Gardner?
- Sorry?

648
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:06,356
Ava Gardner, do you like her?

649
01:08:07,858 --> 01:08:09,484
Yeah, I guess.

650
01:08:10,236 --> 01:08:12,237
I was just thinking that you, uh...

651
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,698
...kind of look like
Ava Gardner a little bit.

652
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,584
You got something you wanna say to me?

653
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,460
I have nothing to say to you.

654
01:08:27,545 --> 01:08:29,588
You got nothing to say, huh?
That's funny.

655
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:33,133
'Cause I could've swore you just gave me
a "fuck you" look right now.

656
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,427
You wanna say "fuck you" to me?

657
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,886
Not at this moment.

658
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,558
Do you know what this is?

659
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:46,021
- A gun.
- It's simplicity itself.

660
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,442
You see, you point it
at what you want to die,

661
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:55,905
and you pull the little trigger here,
and a little bullet comes outta here.

662
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:58,617
And the little bullet
hits you right there.

663
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,703
And you know what?

664
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:05,874
You don't look like Ava Gardner no more.

665
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,547
Don't taunt me, tramp.

666
01:09:12,632 --> 01:09:17,677
I am not one to be taunted. You got it?

667
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:22,182
Let me hear you say "I got it."

668
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:26,311
- I got it.
- You damn well better.

669
01:09:34,612 --> 01:09:35,904
Tool.

670
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,538
That's it. I figured it out.

671
01:09:46,874 --> 01:09:49,668
Salt. Got it all figured out. It's salt.

672
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:54,047
Blood is salty. That's all my sauce
needed was just a little more salt.

673
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:56,966
Just needed a little thickening agent,
you know what I'm talking about.

674
01:09:57,051 --> 01:10:00,178
- What are you doing, JT?
- I gotta put more salt in it.

675
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:02,847
Do the same goddamned thing
the blood did.

676
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:05,225
Tell you what, brother,
that little bit of blood did the trick.

677
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:07,394
Don't do nothing stupid, JT.
I got it covered.

678
01:10:07,478 --> 01:10:10,021
It's already got my sweat and tears.
Now all it needs is some blood!

679
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:14,984
- Drop the gun!
- JT!

680
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:19,155
- Do it now!
- OK, OK. Don't shoot!

681
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:21,032
JT, you all right?

682
01:10:30,584 --> 01:10:32,127
You all right, bro?

683
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:35,547
Goddamn it, I'm not
all right at all. Not at all.

684
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:39,467
- Wait here.
- Oh, I sure will.

685
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,139
Goddamn sauce.

686
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:53,314
Women in cages.

687
01:10:54,191 --> 01:10:56,151
See them in action.

688
01:10:57,445 --> 01:10:59,404
See them in love.

689
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,614
See them in terror.

690
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:04,576
White skin on the black market.

691
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,787
Soft flesh for hard cash.

692
01:11:08,247 --> 01:11:10,081
Women in cages.

693
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,292
I'm gonna go get my dick wet.

694
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:14,419
She's got one leg.

695
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,504
Easier access.

696
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,716
You got a point.

697
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:30,477
Get the rest of this shit upstairs,
and we'll blow this entire floor.

698
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,534
Get Lewis down here.

699
01:11:48,162 --> 01:11:51,706
- He's getting his dick wet, sir.
- Get him the fuck down here now!

700
01:12:01,592 --> 01:12:04,719
- Lewis? Wilson?

701
01:12:20,694 --> 01:12:23,947
- Where are my men?
- I've got several right here.

702
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:27,784
- What the fuck's this?

703
01:12:27,868 --> 01:12:29,994
They're balls, sweetheart.

704
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,042
I'm walking out of here
with the shit, Wray.

705
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:38,336
- Let us go.
- Tell me why we should.

706
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,172
- Because I earned it.
- How you figure that?

707
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:43,925
You want the story?
I'll spin it for you quick.

708
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:47,387
A termite's nest of caves
on the Afghan border,

709
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:50,932
me and my men, walking around
with our dicks in our hands

710
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:54,394
and our balls in our throats,
looking for America's most wanted.

711
01:12:54,478 --> 01:12:56,020
- Bin Laden?
- Yeah.

712
01:12:56,105 --> 01:13:00,233
For once, our intel was right on the
money. I come around a corner, bam,

713
01:13:00,317 --> 01:13:04,779
- there he is, looking me in the eyes.
- Wait. You killed Bin Laden?

714
01:13:05,406 --> 01:13:08,199
I put two in his heart,
one in his computer.

715
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:13,413
- So that was you?
- Yeah, that was me.

716
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:20,086
Class-A clusterfuck.
He wasn't supposed to be there,

717
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,338
we weren't supposed to be there,
and I sure as fuck

718
01:13:22,423 --> 01:13:25,425
wasn't supposed to be the one
to punch his dialysis ticket.

719
01:13:25,509 --> 01:13:29,178
So instead of a chest full of medals,
we got a face full of DC-2.

720
01:13:29,263 --> 01:13:31,472
No cure.

721
01:13:31,849 --> 01:13:33,892
That is not until we found somebody
from the other side

722
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:36,227
willing to sell us batches
of this shit.

723
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:39,689
Science comes first, but business
comes a close fucking second.

724
01:13:39,773 --> 01:13:43,776
Then you realized if you
could infect a large enough populace,

725
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:48,615
experiment on its survivors,
you'd find a cure.

726
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:52,243
I swore to my men that I'd do everything
in my power to keep them alive.

727
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:54,871
That's what I intend to do, Wray.

728
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:59,417
Understand?

729
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,628
I never had a choice.

730
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:07,175
Neither do I, sir.

731
01:14:09,094 --> 01:14:11,095
God bless you
and your service to this country.

732
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:21,105
You're a doctor?

733
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,733
I was earlier tonight.

734
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:28,279
I always wanted to be a doctor.

735
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:32,158
Instead, I can do this.

736
01:14:32,785 --> 01:14:36,621
Useless talent number 66.

737
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:43,711
- I'm very pliable.
- A girlfriend of mine had a theory.

738
01:14:44,505 --> 01:14:46,756
She said at some point in your life...

739
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,426
...you find a use for every
useless talent you ever had.

740
01:14:51,637 --> 01:14:55,264
- It's like connecting the dots.
- I'm not that optimistic.

741
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,519
I feel like I'm sinking down the drain
and I can't get out.

742
01:14:59,603 --> 01:15:03,481
She'd say... when you're stuck
in that spiral...

743
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:06,776
...you reach up.

744
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:09,654
What if there's nothing up there?

745
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,407
Just reach up.

746
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,996
- You're a dancer.
- I was earlier tonight.

747
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,540
Well, I'm pulling you out of retirement!

748
01:15:23,377 --> 01:15:25,420
Get your ass up!

749
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:31,926
Now I'm starved for entertainment, baby,
and that means you. Radio!

750
01:15:33,012 --> 01:15:34,887
I'm Too Drunk To Fuck]

751
01:15:34,972 --> 01:15:36,597
Well, baby, now!

752
01:15:45,024 --> 01:15:48,985
That's what I'm talking about.
Dance it up.

753
01:15:50,863 --> 01:15:52,864
Keep dancing!

754
01:15:54,867 --> 01:15:58,619
I have seen me some crazy-ass shit
in my day...

755
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,041
...but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

756
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,835
I've seen me a stripper
with one breast...

757
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:08,880
...and I've seen me a stripper
with 12 toes...

758
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:11,549
...and I've seen me a stripper
with no brains at all...

759
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:14,886
...but I ain't never seen me
a one-legged stripper.

760
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:16,846
And I've been to Morocco.

761
01:16:17,723 --> 01:16:19,557
Dance, bitch!

762
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,311
Break a leg.

763
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:25,229
Break it off!

764
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,700
- Dance for me, motherfucker.

765
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:54,008
You thought it was pretty funny,
didn't you?

766
01:16:54,093 --> 01:16:56,636
Actually, yes.

767
01:16:57,221 --> 01:17:00,473
You gave me some wood,
now I'm gonna give you...

768
01:17:00,557 --> 01:17:03,142
...some fucking wood!

769
01:17:17,074 --> 01:17:19,117
Your gas! You need your gas!

770
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:23,538
No, fuck the gas! Fuck it!
I'm just gonna have to make this quick!

771
01:17:37,636 --> 01:17:42,640
- Where did you get that?
- Useless talent number 37.

772
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,127
- I broke my leg.
- That's OK.

773
01:18:11,879 --> 01:18:13,796
I made you something.

774
01:18:16,008 --> 01:18:19,844
I do believe in you. Always have.

775
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:22,513
I believe that you could be better.

776
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:24,932
You deserve better...

777
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:26,559
...even better than me.

778
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:30,646
Right now, I need you to become...

779
01:18:32,482 --> 01:18:34,775
...who you're meant to be.

780
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,068
Stand.

781
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:43,784
I'd stand clear if I were you.

782
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,210
Open that door, will you, baby?

783
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:23,366
They've destroyed most of the tanks.

784
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:26,118
Any that are left we'll get
on our way to the helicopters.

785
01:19:26,203 --> 01:19:30,623
There are two helicopters,
big enough to take all of us.

786
01:19:32,042 --> 01:19:33,084
Who can fly?

787
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:38,673
Can anyone else fly a helicopter?

788
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,343
I can fly, but no way in hell
I'm gonna fly tonight.

789
01:19:42,427 --> 01:19:45,513
OK, cool. I'll fly.

790
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:48,599
Let's go.

791
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,315
I think we're gonna stay here, Wray.

792
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,860
You'll take care of this
for me then, sheriff?

793
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:03,197
- With pleasure.
- Three minutes.

794
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:08,202
- Your brother's a good man, JT.
- Best in Texas.

795
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:12,790
Hop on.

796
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:18,087
- No, the other way.
- Oh.

797
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:23,592
No, the other way.

798
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:13,351
The helicopters are on
the other side of this wall.

799
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,484
We make a run for it!

800
01:21:21,568 --> 01:21:24,653
No! If we all get killed,
there's no stopping this plague.

801
01:21:24,738 --> 01:21:28,574
Don't you get it?
We're the antidote!

802
01:21:28,658 --> 01:21:31,827
- Well, is there another way around?
- Wait here.

803
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:02,149
I don't suppose there are any
other biochemical engineers around?

804
01:22:02,234 --> 01:22:04,026
Take that as no.

805
01:22:05,904 --> 01:22:07,780
We have to get over that wall.

806
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:16,539
I was thinking we could build us a new
place right there where the old one was.

807
01:22:17,249 --> 01:22:20,835
You cook, I work the back.

808
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,089
You don't make that rent
so goddamn high.

809
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:28,801
You share the recipe,
we share the rent.

810
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:36,100
Start at 250 degrees.

811
01:22:39,604 --> 01:22:42,148
I knew it. For how long?

812
01:22:42,232 --> 01:22:44,608
- Twelve pounds?
- Sure.

813
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,902
Twelve pounds, 12 hours.

814
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:51,323
- Wrapped in tin foil, right?
- I don't use no goddamn foil.

815
01:22:51,408 --> 01:22:54,702
Damn. Tomatoes? Fresh?

816
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:57,621
Canned.

817
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:58,831
- No shit?
- Yeah.

818
01:22:58,915 --> 01:23:01,750
- Score me some?
- Oh, yeah.

819
01:23:02,502 --> 01:23:04,420
'Cause we're brothers.

820
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:08,048
Thank you for this.

821
01:23:08,133 --> 01:23:12,261
You just remember you got to take
this recipe to your grave.

822
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:16,640
I think I can goddamn guarantee that.

823
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,083
That's our cue.

824
01:23:45,629 --> 01:23:47,630
Cherry Darling...

825
01:23:49,007 --> 01:23:50,508
...it's all you.

826
01:24:21,706 --> 01:24:23,249
Let's go!

827
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:32,067
Wray!

828
01:25:35,363 --> 01:25:37,031
Damn it, Wray!

829
01:25:39,618 --> 01:25:42,578
OK, you need to get up
'cause we're leaving.

830
01:26:07,854 --> 01:26:10,564
They told me I'd find you here.

831
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:15,778
I was beginning to lose hope.

832
01:26:16,237 --> 01:26:20,366
I'm sorry... but I lied.

833
01:26:23,078 --> 01:26:26,413
I did wanna hurt you.

834
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,875
My turn.

835
01:26:40,387 --> 01:26:44,098
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.

836
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:48,143
Never did like that son of a bitch.

837
01:26:50,522 --> 01:26:54,233
About as useless as a pecker on a pope.

838
01:27:00,532 --> 01:27:02,991
- Don't touch anything.
- I want to fly it!

839
01:27:03,076 --> 01:27:05,285
- He said not to touch anything!
- You don't know what you're doing!

840
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:07,538
I do know what I'm doing! Shut up!

841
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:10,749
Shut up! Sit down
and don't fucking touch anything!

842
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,465
Everybody sit down!

843
01:27:25,348 --> 01:27:30,394
Whoo!

844
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,233
Hit the wipers.

845
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:46,326
- Go on, leave me.
- I am not leaving you here like this.

846
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:49,329
The motherfuckers around here
eat roadkill.

847
01:27:51,082 --> 01:27:53,709
See? I'm funny.

848
01:27:54,544 --> 01:27:57,337
- I made you laugh.
- Go to the ocean.

849
01:27:57,422 --> 01:28:00,340
Put your backs to it,
protect yourselves there.

850
01:28:01,551 --> 01:28:03,218
I'm not leaving you, Wray.

851
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:07,222
It's two against the world.

852
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:10,017
It will be.

853
01:28:11,311 --> 01:28:13,145
I promise.

854
01:28:13,229 --> 01:28:14,855
I never miss.

855
01:28:15,732 --> 01:28:18,233
- Don't worry, baby.

856
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:21,111
You'll find your way.

857
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:39,630
Reach up!

858
01:28:52,352 --> 01:28:54,269
Reach up!

859
01:29:02,195 --> 01:29:05,197
Two Against the World]

860
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,151
It's like you said
it would be, Wray.

861
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:46,947
I'm like you said I would be.

862
01:29:47,615 --> 01:29:49,366
I find the lost...

863
01:29:50,285 --> 01:29:51,577
...the weary...

864
01:29:52,871 --> 01:29:54,913
...those that have no hope.

865
01:29:54,998 --> 01:29:58,125
I find them and I lead them...

866
01:29:59,043 --> 01:30:01,295
...to a land we've made for ourselves.

867
01:30:02,672 --> 01:30:05,173
The land by the sea.

868
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,001
It's beautiful.

869
01:30:41,878 --> 01:30:44,254
She's beautiful.

870
01:30:46,341 --> 01:30:49,718
I wish you could see us... us two.

871
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,930
It's like you said it would be.

872
01:30:54,098 --> 01:30:56,934
Two against the world, baby.

873
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,061
Two against the world.

874
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:34,697
This film is a brilliant
achievement in motion picture history.

875
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:38,033
Finally, the truth
about Hitler's diabolical plans

876
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,869
to create a race
of superwomen can be told...

877
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,582
Werewolf Women of the SS!

878
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,085
Welcome to Death Camp 13,

879
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,547
home of the Nazi's diabolical plan
to create an army

880
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:53,757
of super-werewolf soldiers.

881
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,176
This project, it's failure...

882
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:57,845
...will be your demise.

883
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:01,265
- And the end of Germany, Boorman.
- Heil Hitler!

884
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,891
You have been chosen!

885
01:32:02,976 --> 01:32:05,102
Rejoice!

886
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:12,484
I have found the perfect solution...
the She-Devils of Belzac.

887
01:32:16,323 --> 01:32:19,825
Can they, alone, supply the
blood needed to save Hitler's mad dream?

888
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,621
Or, will the pride of Germany
fall into ruin?

889
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:25,831
This is my project!

890
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:31,253
We are now in total control
of pure wolf.

891
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:34,173
This is an outrage!

892
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,723
- Silence!
- Featuring Udo Kier,

893
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:44,433
Sheri Moon Zombie,

894
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:46,143
Tom Towles,

895
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:47,770
Sybil Danning,

896
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,188
Bill Moseley...

897
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,775
...and Nicolas Cage

898
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:56,028
as... Fu Manchu.

899
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,907
This is my Mecca!

900
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:10,125
Werewolf Women of the SS!

901
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,378
Written and directed by Rob Zombie.

902
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:45,619
If you...

903
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:48,247
...are thinking...

904
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:50,290
...of going...

905
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,667
...into...

906
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:54,378
...this house...

907
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:57,047
...don't.

908
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,091
If you...

909
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:01,301
...are thinking...

910
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,011
...of opening...

911
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:05,264
...this door...

912
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,309
...don't.

913
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,519
If you...

914
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:11,812
...are thinking...

915
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,023
...of checking out...

916
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,942
...the basement...

917
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,698
- -...don't.

918
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,867
Don't look behind...

919
01:34:24,951 --> 01:34:27,202
Don't look in there...

920
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:29,538
Don't look up...

921
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,457
Don't look anywhere.

922
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:35,752
Don't scream for help.

923
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,921
- Don't move a muscle.

924
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:42,551
Don't even breathe.

925
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:46,180
Don't, don't, don't, don't,

926
01:34:46,264 --> 01:34:48,682
don't, don't, don't,

927
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:51,101
don't, don't, don't,

928
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:52,978
don't, don't, don't,

929
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:54,730
don't, don't, don't,

930
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:55,981
don't, don't!

931
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:59,234
If you are thinking
of seeing this film alone...

932
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:00,611
...don't!

933
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:01,778
'Don't'.

934
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,505
This holiday season...

935
01:35:19,589 --> 01:35:22,591
...prepare to have
the stuffing scared out of you.

936
01:35:25,637 --> 01:35:27,012
Thanksgiving.

937
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,016
In the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts,

938
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,768
the fourth Thursday in November

939
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:34,937
is the most celebrated day of the year.

940
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:39,775
The table is set.

941
01:35:39,859 --> 01:35:41,860
The festivities have begun.

942
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:45,447
One uninvited guest has arrived.

943
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:50,160
And this year,
there will be no leftovers.

944
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:09,388
Thanksgiving.

945
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:21,692
White meat, dark meat......
all will be carved.

946
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,782
Thanksgiving.

947
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,450
Come on, Judy, how about it?

948
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,080
Happy Thanksgiving, baby.

949
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:49,886
Thanksgiving.

950
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,430
Cool it, Judy!

951
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:53,765
You're safe.

952
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,225
Bobby's here.

953
01:37:08,448 --> 01:37:09,531
It's blood.

954
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,660
Son of a bitch.

955
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:18,665
- Arrive hungry......
- Happy Thanksgiving, Grandma!

956
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,584
-...leave stuffed.

957
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:25,756
From Director Eli Roth...

958
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,133
...Thanksgiving.

959
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:31,178
You'll come home for the holidays...
in a body bag.

960
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:33,722
This February.

961
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:42,397
Get more out of life.

962
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:44,816
Go out to a movie.

963
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:39,741
Hold on, I've got to come up!

964
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:41,952
I've got to take
the world's biggest fucking piss.

965
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,996
- We can't be late!
- We won't!

966
01:41:09,522 --> 01:41:12,065
- Who's holding?
- If you're not, then nobody.

967
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:14,943
- We were kinda hoping you were.
- How are you not holding?

968
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:18,488
Jesus Christ, Shanna, it is
not my fucking job to supply y'all

969
01:41:18,573 --> 01:41:21,950
- with weed when we go out.
- Whoa, whoa, little lady...

970
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:25,203
You're getting angry kinda quick,
don't you think? I was just teasing you.

971
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:28,415
I'm not angry. It just would be nice
if y'all didn't just count on me

972
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:32,586
all the fucking time, and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

973
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:36,006
OK, mean girl in a high school movie,
you through having a tantrum?

974
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:38,133
- I'm not having a tantrum.
- All right, come on, guys. Don't fight.

975
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:39,467
I'll pay for it when we get some.

976
01:41:39,552 --> 01:41:43,388
One, it's not about the money. It is
about the pain in the ass of scoring.

977
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:45,807
And two... We're not really fighting.

978
01:41:45,892 --> 01:41:49,561
Arlene, you've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

979
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:53,481
That wasn't a fight. That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

980
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:57,485
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

981
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,570
Oh, billboard!

982
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:05,452
OK, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

983
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:06,828
Bet your ass he is.

984
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:09,539
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

985
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,583
He's got a big thing for Julia.

986
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,668
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me

987
01:42:13,753 --> 01:42:15,545
as opposed to disappearing
for six months.

988
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:17,672
And he'd get his ass
down here more often than he does.

989
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,467
And on my birthday,
he'd give me a fucking phone call.

990
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:22,719
But other than that,
he's putty in my hands.

991
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,096
So, what's the plan, man?

992
01:42:25,181 --> 01:42:27,474
Margaritas and Mexican food
at Guero's, touch base

993
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:31,311
with Chris and Jesse, tell them about
later, and make damn sure they come.

994
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:34,272
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor.

995
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:39,778
Oh, shit. Speaking of which, what
happened with you and Nate last night?

996
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:42,781
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

997
01:42:42,865 --> 01:42:45,575
If you don't bust their balls a bit,
they never gonna respect you.

998
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:48,036
OK, we're clear on what
it is you didn't do.

999
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,664
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

1000
01:42:50,748 --> 01:42:52,415
Nothing to write home about.

1001
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,709
We just made out
on the couch for about 20 minutes.

1002
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:56,878
- Dress, half-dressed, or naked?
- Dressed.

1003
01:42:56,963 --> 01:42:59,756
I said we made out,
we didn't do "the thing."

1004
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,676
Excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing?"

1005
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,719
You know, it's everything but.

1006
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:08,223
- They call that "the thing?"
- I call it "the thing."

1007
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:11,810
- Do guys like "the thing?"
- They like it better than "no thing."

1008
01:43:13,771 --> 01:43:15,981
OK, I want to get back
to what it is you did do.

1009
01:43:16,065 --> 01:43:17,983
So you're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

1010
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:19,067
Correct.

1011
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:22,737
- Whose couch, his or your hotel room?
- What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

1012
01:43:22,822 --> 01:43:25,115
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

1013
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:26,366
We started sitting up,

1014
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:30,620
- we worked our way to lying down.
- The plot thickens. Who was on top?

1015
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:33,164
I was straddling him.

1016
01:43:33,249 --> 01:43:35,417
- So, what about tonight?
- We'll see, Shanna.

1017
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:38,253
I mean, I like Nate and all.
He's cute. He's a pretty good kisser.

1018
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:40,547
- But it ain't a done deal.
- Ah, fuck Nate.

1019
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:43,550
He's cute and all but
Jesse Letterman's gonna be all over her.

1020
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:47,470
- Jesse Letterman, the director?
- He's a good friend.

1021
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:50,390
- Maybe they can bring some pot.
- Fuck that. No!

1022
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:53,101
- I don't want to be either,
- Depending on their fucking ass,

1023
01:43:53,185 --> 01:43:55,937
Dependant on their ass.
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,

1024
01:43:56,022 --> 01:43:58,481
we're gonna be stuck
with them all fucking night.

1025
01:43:58,566 --> 01:44:01,609
- Oh! Try Lanna Frank.
- Best idea you had all day.

1026
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:05,780
Oh, hey, that's your
last billboard before Guero's.

1027
01:44:05,865 --> 01:44:07,282
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

1028
01:44:07,366 --> 01:44:09,951
Oh, come on, my ass.
We said every time!

1029
01:44:10,036 --> 01:44:11,202
OK.

1030
01:44:25,926 --> 01:44:28,219
Jules, let me get a drag. Thanks!

1031
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:03,505
Hey, this is...
my UT days, Arlene.

1032
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:04,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

1033
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:07,467
- You want to join us?
- For a second, I'm with some friends.

1034
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:09,677
Ooh...

1035
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:14,516
So you must be... must be...
you must be the infamous Butterfly.

1036
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:15,934
Shh!

1037
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:18,686
- She don't know nothing about it.
- Know about what?

1038
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:20,730
- When were y'all gonna tell her?
- Soon.

1039
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:22,190
- Tell me what?
- Now thanks to you,

1040
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:23,775
we gotta tell her sooner than later.

1041
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,443
Cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

1042
01:45:25,528 --> 01:45:28,196
I said a little something
about you on the air today.

1043
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,657
Julia, what the fuck did
you say about me on the radio?

1044
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:34,327
All I said was,
I had a sexy friend named Butterfly

1045
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,079
who's in from out of town
for the weekend.

1046
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:38,873
And we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight.

1047
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,584
And if they were out on the town
maybe they'd see us,

1048
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:46,214
and I described you, and I said that
if they spotted you while we were out

1049
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:49,050
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.

1050
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:53,179
OK, now Julia, I'm serious. What did
you say and what did you say I'd do?

1051
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:56,891
Anyhoo, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

1052
01:45:56,976 --> 01:46:01,104
or Marcy over here,
who is an incredible actress

1053
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:03,398
could act it out for you,
which I think

1054
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:06,317
will give you a better idea
of what you have in store for you.

1055
01:46:06,402 --> 01:46:08,444
OK, so just tell me your way.

1056
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:10,530
- We'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

1057
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:14,075
- OK, give Marcy your drink.
- Thank you.

1058
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:19,038
OK, so you're in a club or a bar
and Marcy is a kind of cute,

1059
01:46:19,123 --> 01:46:22,292
or kind of hot, or kind of sexy,
or better be fucking hysterically funny,

1060
01:46:22,376 --> 01:46:25,253
but not funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.

1061
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:28,339
- Got it.
- OK, Marcy. Take it.

1062
01:46:37,766 --> 01:46:40,852
- Howdy.
- Hi, there.

1063
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,773
Excuse me, but your name
wouldn't be Butterfly would it?

1064
01:46:45,858 --> 01:46:49,736
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

1065
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,780
- Barry.
- Pleased to meet you, Barry.

1066
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:55,366
- Y'all are getting me hot.
- Shh!

1067
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:03,082
So, is Butterfly your real name?

1068
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:06,878
Yes, it is. And how did you know
my name, Barry?

1069
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,756
I listened to Jungle Julia's
show this morning.

1070
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,507
- Oh, you did, did you?
- Oh, yeah.

1071
01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:14,969
- I listen to her show every morning.
- Oh, you do, do you?

1072
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:18,514
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.

1073
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:24,562
- Don't you think she's got a big ass?
- Nah, man. I like her ass that way.

1074
01:47:24,647 --> 01:47:27,482
She got a black girl's ass.

1075
01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:29,484
That's what she says,
but in actual fact,

1076
01:47:29,568 --> 01:47:31,569
she doesn't really have
a black girl's ass.

1077
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:34,781
- She's got a big ass.
- OK, what the fuck are you doing?

1078
01:47:34,865 --> 01:47:36,699
Oh, look who wants
to get to the point.

1079
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:39,953
OK, we'll get to the point but,
for your information, skinny bitch,

1080
01:47:40,037 --> 01:47:43,248
black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men

1081
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:45,833
have had plenty fun adoring my ass.

1082
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:48,962
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

1083
01:47:49,046 --> 01:47:51,464
If you're not gonna buy me a drink
can I have mine back?

1084
01:47:51,548 --> 01:47:52,840
No, OK, OK, OK, OK.

1085
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:57,178
So Butterfly, can I buy you a drink?

1086
01:47:57,263 --> 01:47:59,347
- I'd love one.
- What can I get you?

1087
01:47:59,431 --> 01:48:03,518
- I'll take a margarita.
- Here you go.

1088
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:09,315
So, after they buy you a drink,
when they raise their glass to toast,

1089
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:14,362
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem:

1090
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:18,533
The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

1091
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:23,705
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep

1092
01:48:23,789 --> 01:48:25,873
Did you hear me Butterfly?

1093
01:48:25,958 --> 01:48:29,210
Miles to go before you sleep.

1094
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:33,131
And then, if they say that...

1095
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:35,758
-...you gotta give them a lap dance.
- What?

1096
01:48:35,843 --> 01:48:38,011
- If they call you Butterfly,

1097
01:48:38,095 --> 01:48:41,014
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,
you gotta give them a lap dance.

1098
01:48:41,098 --> 01:48:43,016
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

1099
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:44,058
You can do it or not.

1100
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:46,602
But if you don't, everybody in Austin's
gonna think you a chickenshit.

1101
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:49,814
And I don't think you want everybody in
Austin thinking you're a chickenshit.

1102
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:52,692
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

1103
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:56,070
Look, you don't have to do it
for anyone you don't want.

1104
01:48:56,155 --> 01:48:58,990
I said you'd do it for
the first guy who says it, so...

1105
01:48:59,074 --> 01:49:01,242
...some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

1106
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:03,911
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

1107
01:49:03,996 --> 01:49:08,082
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

1108
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:12,503
But maybe, a little later in the
evening, you've had a few drinks,

1109
01:49:12,588 --> 01:49:16,424
you're kind of loosey-goosey,
you're safe with your girls,

1110
01:49:16,508 --> 01:49:20,386
then some kind of cute, kind of hot,
kind of sexy, hysterically funny,

1111
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:23,389
but not funny-looking guy
comes up and says it.

1112
01:49:23,474 --> 01:49:26,934
Then, maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

1113
01:50:41,635 --> 01:50:45,012
- Any dead soldiers here?
- These two. Thank you.

1114
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:51,769
- Where the hell is Lanna Frank?
- That's a good fucking question.

1115
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:05,616
Lanna Frank, where are you?

1116
01:51:07,703 --> 01:51:09,912
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

1117
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:13,040
- Shit! Hold on!

1118
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:26,762
So where are you?

1119
01:51:28,056 --> 01:51:30,141
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

1120
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:33,060
No, we are not coming over there.

1121
01:51:33,145 --> 01:51:36,189
You come over here
like you said you would.

1122
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:39,442
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

1123
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,777
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck, I...

1124
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:47,116
Now, there is one thing that every girl
in the whole world whose name is Shanna

1125
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:50,411
has in common with each other.
We all hate the name Shauna.

1126
01:51:50,496 --> 01:51:52,914
And we really hate it
when you call us Shauna.

1127
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:34,205
Just remember, it's Shanna Banana,
not Shauna Banauna.

1128
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:37,625
OK, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

1129
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,043
Yeah, I mean...

1130
01:52:39,127 --> 01:52:40,920
...it wasn't bullish, but...

1131
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:11,742
OK, Warren is sending over shots
and you know the house rule.

1132
01:53:11,827 --> 01:53:14,328
If he sends over shots,
you've got to do them.

1133
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:16,706
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

1134
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:18,666
Warren says it, we do it!

1135
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:22,837
I love that philosophy.
"Warren says it, we do it."

1136
01:53:22,921 --> 01:53:26,173
- So, let's do it.
- What is it?

1137
01:53:26,258 --> 01:53:29,844
Hey, shots first, questions later.
Here we go, post time!

1138
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:36,434
Woo-hoo!

1139
01:53:40,314 --> 01:53:43,733
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

1140
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:46,902
- What the fuck is it?
- Chartreuse.

1141
01:53:46,987 --> 01:53:50,448
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.

1142
01:53:52,242 --> 01:53:54,535
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?

1143
01:53:54,620 --> 01:53:57,788
Not me.
I'm going out for a smoke.

1144
01:53:57,873 --> 01:54:00,666
OK, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

1145
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:02,877
Blow up the joint..

1146
01:54:15,265 --> 01:54:16,849
Drinks! What can we get you?

1147
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:20,561
- Shanna Banana?
- Another big-ass Long Island iced tea.

1148
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:24,940
- Bombay Sapphire and tonic. No ice.
- Good boy.

1149
01:54:46,963 --> 01:54:50,800
Oh, hey, Punky, one of the lights is off
in the parking lot. Flip it!

1150
01:55:53,405 --> 01:55:55,906
Look, you can't look like you're
trying to get her out of here

1151
01:55:55,991 --> 01:55:57,283
before Christian Simonson shows up,

1152
01:55:57,367 --> 01:56:00,327
but you gotta get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

1153
01:56:00,412 --> 01:56:03,372
What's the point? They're going
to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake LBJ

1154
01:56:03,457 --> 01:56:06,083
and it's no guys. Absolutely no guys.

1155
01:56:06,168 --> 01:56:08,753
OK, so after we bring the girls drinks,

1156
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:13,549
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

1157
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:16,093
You think they're gonna fall for that?

1158
01:56:16,178 --> 01:56:20,222
We'll be very convincing.
Now it's time to turn up the volume.

1159
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:23,058
No more fucking around.
We go to Jäger shots.

1160
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:26,228
Man, they're not gonna
drink Jäger shots.

1161
01:56:26,313 --> 01:56:29,899
As long as the guy's buying the booze,
a fucking bitch will drink anything.

1162
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:33,027
We can at least get one shot of Jäger
down these fucking bitches' throats.

1163
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:35,362
After that, we'll see
if they got another Jäger in them.

1164
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:36,864
You never know.
That could be the shot

1165
01:56:36,948 --> 01:56:38,741
that puts them
past the point of fuck-it.

1166
01:56:38,825 --> 01:56:40,868
Then all of a sudden,
"no guys at the lake house"

1167
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,620
turns into "a couple guys
at the lake house."

1168
01:56:42,704 --> 01:56:44,121
My point exactly.

1169
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:51,545
Dude, check it out. I wonder
if BJ brought the bear with him.

1170
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,800
Jesus.

1171
01:56:57,677 --> 01:57:01,263
The dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

1172
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:36,590
Where did you two
disappear to?

1173
01:57:36,675 --> 01:57:39,093
I had to get something out of the car
and Nate was gentlemanly enough

1174
01:57:39,177 --> 01:57:41,053
to escort me with his umbrella.

1175
01:57:41,137 --> 01:57:43,514
Ah... Good for you, Nate.

1176
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,516
See that pretty girl sitting
by herself at the bar?

1177
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,937
Who, the dirty hippie?

1178
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:53,107
- Meow. She's not a hippie.
- She might as well be a hippie.

1179
01:57:54,776 --> 01:57:57,152
Thank you, Timmy boy.

1180
01:57:57,237 --> 01:57:59,989
Well, do you know what
just happened to her?

1181
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:02,783
No, but I know she's
a skinny fake blonde bitch.

1182
01:58:05,328 --> 01:58:09,039
Oh, I'm sorry. You were telling a story.
What about her?

1183
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:14,044
Hey, Warren!!
Is there anybody in this place

1184
01:58:14,129 --> 01:58:16,088
you can vouch for
to give me a ride home?

1185
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:21,218
- Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

1186
01:58:21,303 --> 01:58:22,803
You've been eavesdropping?

1187
01:58:22,888 --> 01:58:25,973
There's "eavesdropping""
and "can't help but hear."

1188
01:58:26,057 --> 01:58:28,809
I think I belong in the latter category.

1189
01:58:28,894 --> 01:58:33,272
So, uh, Icy Hot,
you offering me a ride home?

1190
01:58:33,356 --> 01:58:36,984
I'm offering you a lift, if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

1191
01:58:37,068 --> 01:58:39,278
And, when are you thinking
about leaving?

1192
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:41,780
Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it.

1193
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:45,326
When I do,
you will be the first to know.

1194
01:58:45,410 --> 01:58:47,745
Will you be able to, uh, drive later?

1195
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:52,499
I know looks can be deceiving
but I'm a teetotaler.

1196
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:55,085
I've been drinking club soda
and lime all night.

1197
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,046
Now, I'm building up
to my big drink.

1198
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:01,425
- Which is what?
- A virgin piña colada.

1199
01:59:01,509 --> 01:59:02,843
OK!

1200
01:59:02,928 --> 01:59:08,349
Why would someone who doesn't drink
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

1201
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:11,644
You know, a bar offers all kind
of things other than alcohol.

1202
01:59:11,728 --> 01:59:16,106
Hmm, really? Like what?

1203
01:59:17,943 --> 01:59:19,360
Women.

1204
01:59:19,444 --> 01:59:21,487
Nacho Grande platters.

1205
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:25,449
The fellowship of some fascinating
individuals, like Warren here.

1206
01:59:26,326 --> 01:59:28,994
Fair enough.
So what's your name, Icy?

1207
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,830
Stuntman Mike.

1208
01:59:32,874 --> 01:59:34,375
Stuntman Mike's your name?

1209
01:59:35,627 --> 01:59:37,211
You ask anybody.

1210
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:42,967
- Hey, Warren. Who is this guy?
- Stuntman Mike.

1211
01:59:43,051 --> 01:59:46,345
- And who the hell is Stuntman Mike?
- He's a stuntman.

1212
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:51,016
Warren!!
Six shots of Wild Turkey!

1213
02:00:49,409 --> 02:00:51,076
Hey, if it ain't Lanna Frank.

1214
02:00:51,161 --> 02:00:54,204
- Hey, baby..
- How are you?

1215
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,292
Hey, you.

1216
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,210
- What's shaking, bacon?

1217
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:02,212
Hey.

1218
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:09,762
- Holas, bitcholas.
- It's about fucking time.

1219
02:01:09,846 --> 02:01:12,473
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

1220
02:01:12,557 --> 02:01:14,641
Take a picture, it'll last longer.

1221
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:17,061
What?

1222
02:01:17,145 --> 02:01:20,230
That table, it seems to keep
getting your attention.

1223
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:23,150
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

1224
02:01:23,234 --> 02:01:27,112
- Yep!
- She sure is a striking-looking woman.

1225
02:01:27,197 --> 02:01:29,114
You got gin, tequila, Jäger...

1226
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,658
- Look at that hair.
- Lots of leave-in conditioner.

1227
02:01:33,369 --> 02:01:35,287
Is that jealousy I detect?

1228
02:01:35,371 --> 02:01:39,291
Hardly. But, if you want
to get with Jungle Julia,

1229
02:01:39,375 --> 02:01:41,835
- there's a real easy way to do that.
- Really?

1230
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,088
- And what would that be?
- Get famous.

1231
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:46,507
You won't have to find her.
She'll find you.

1232
02:01:46,591 --> 02:01:49,551
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.

1233
02:01:49,636 --> 02:01:52,805
Enjoy it, cocksucker.
You've earned it.

1234
02:01:52,889 --> 02:01:55,682
- What did she ever do to you?
- We went to school together

1235
02:01:55,767 --> 02:01:59,353
from kindergarten through high school.
That's what she did to me.

1236
02:01:59,437 --> 02:02:02,272
She was her height right now at 12.

1237
02:02:02,357 --> 02:02:06,193
She was a monster. Half the guys
she still fucks from the old class

1238
02:02:06,277 --> 02:02:08,028
she used to beat up and
terrorize in the fifth grade.

1239
02:02:08,113 --> 02:02:10,948
I see. She used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk?

1240
02:02:11,032 --> 02:02:14,159
That pituitary case might have
kicked my ass a couple of times.

1241
02:02:14,244 --> 02:02:17,204
Sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man,

1242
02:02:17,288 --> 02:02:20,833
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

1243
02:02:40,770 --> 02:02:45,816
- Hey, are you famous or something?
- Or something.

1244
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,527
No, no, no, no, really.

1245
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:51,363
Hey, what do you do?

1246
02:02:51,447 --> 02:02:56,410
Really? What I do is work my ass off to
get my own record label off the ground.

1247
02:02:56,494 --> 02:03:01,874
But why that girl wanted a picture
of me is because I'm a local DJ.

1248
02:03:03,918 --> 02:03:06,170
Wait a minute.

1249
02:03:06,254 --> 02:03:09,631
You got a billboard by
Big Kahuna Burger don't you?

1250
02:03:09,716 --> 02:03:11,466
Yeah.

1251
02:03:11,551 --> 02:03:13,844
I got one there too, Zatoichi.

1252
02:03:17,015 --> 02:03:18,891
Yeah.

1253
02:03:19,517 --> 02:03:23,228
- Jungle Julia Lucai.
- Stuntman Mike McKay.

1254
02:03:23,313 --> 02:03:27,941
Well, good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

1255
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,152
Now my friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.

1256
02:03:30,236 --> 02:03:32,988
- Would you care for some?
- Thank you, Julia.

1257
02:03:33,072 --> 02:03:36,825
- But just the same, no thanks.
- Suit yourself.

1258
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:38,243
But you know...

1259
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:49,880
Oh, shit.

1260
02:03:50,173 --> 02:03:51,423
I gotta sn...

1261
02:03:53,635 --> 02:03:55,719
Sorry, nothing.

1262
02:03:58,389 --> 02:03:59,848
What the fuck was that?

1263
02:04:00,225 --> 02:04:03,060
Actually, I do want you
to have a shot.

1264
02:04:04,395 --> 02:04:07,981
You got some voucher here.
I asked him what movies you worked on,

1265
02:04:08,066 --> 02:04:09,816
no fucking clue.

1266
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:13,153
Well, I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

1267
02:04:13,238 --> 02:04:17,241
I mean, he shows me an episode of
High Chaparral, a guy falls off a horse

1268
02:04:17,325 --> 02:04:18,700
he says it's him.

1269
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:22,746
You know the show The Virginian?

1270
02:04:24,415 --> 02:04:27,167
Yeah, well, there was another actor
on that show, Gary Clarke,

1271
02:04:27,252 --> 02:04:29,127
and I looked like him a bit.

1272
02:04:29,212 --> 02:04:32,297
Well, obviously before
I cut myself shaving.

1273
02:04:32,382 --> 02:04:34,341
Aw, I like it.

1274
02:04:34,425 --> 02:04:38,553
Well, damn, if ain't so sweet you
make sugar taste just like salt.

1275
02:04:38,638 --> 02:04:42,349
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.

1276
02:04:42,433 --> 02:04:45,811
And then that show turned into
The Men of Shiloh,

1277
02:04:45,895 --> 02:04:47,980
they brought on
Lee Majors and I doubled him.

1278
02:04:48,898 --> 02:04:52,067
From that point on,
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

1279
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:55,904
I did damn near the whole
third season of Vegas.

1280
02:04:55,989 --> 02:04:58,156
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

1281
02:04:58,241 --> 02:05:01,201
And then Bob did another show, Gavilan,

1282
02:05:01,286 --> 02:05:03,787
and he brought me with him
on that until...

1283
02:05:05,373 --> 02:05:06,915
And after that...

1284
02:05:10,753 --> 02:05:14,131
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

1285
02:05:14,716 --> 02:05:17,801
- Sorry. No?
- No.

1286
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:26,268
So, how exactly does one become
a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

1287
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:31,315
Well, in Hollywood,
anybody fool enough to throw himself

1288
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:34,526
down a flight of stairs can usually
find somebody to pay him for it.

1289
02:05:35,653 --> 02:05:39,072
But really, I got into the business the
way most get into the stunt business.

1290
02:05:39,157 --> 02:05:40,407
How's that?

1291
02:05:40,491 --> 02:05:42,951
- My brother got me in it.
- Who's your brother?

1292
02:05:43,036 --> 02:05:45,329
Stuntman Bob.

1293
02:05:57,967 --> 02:06:00,594
- I'm ready to blaze.
- Finally, yeah.

1294
02:06:00,678 --> 02:06:02,054
You need to catch up with us.

1295
02:06:02,138 --> 02:06:04,431
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

1296
02:06:04,515 --> 02:06:08,685
Anyhoo, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

1297
02:06:09,437 --> 02:06:13,315
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

1298
02:06:13,399 --> 02:06:15,734
Promise..
You ready to go to the lake?

1299
02:06:15,818 --> 02:06:17,861
- Hm-hm.
- How about your little friend?

1300
02:06:17,945 --> 02:06:19,821
- You want to bring him?
- I thought no boys.

1301
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:22,115
You want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

1302
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:25,243
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

1303
02:06:25,328 --> 02:06:27,704
- Us girls..
- Good idea.

1304
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:31,041
Ladies.

1305
02:06:33,211 --> 02:06:34,544
Thanks.

1306
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:37,547
Cheers, Butterfly.

1307
02:06:39,884 --> 02:06:43,637
The woods are lovely dark and deep

1308
02:06:43,721 --> 02:06:49,101
And I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep

1309
02:06:49,185 --> 02:06:52,229
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

1310
02:06:52,313 --> 02:06:56,650
Miles to go before you sleep.

1311
02:06:58,069 --> 02:07:00,862
- Sorry, Stuntman Burt.
- Mike.

1312
02:07:00,947 --> 02:07:04,324
Mike, she already broke off that dance.

1313
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:06,535
Is that true?

1314
02:07:07,578 --> 02:07:10,163
Did I miss my chance?

1315
02:07:13,292 --> 02:07:14,960
Do I frighten you?

1316
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:21,258
Is it my scar?

1317
02:07:23,428 --> 02:07:25,137
It's your car.

1318
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:28,473
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

1319
02:07:28,558 --> 02:07:31,435
It's my mom's car.

1320
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:36,106
Have you been following us?

1321
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:40,527
No, but that's what I love
about Austin. It's just so damn small.

1322
02:07:40,611 --> 02:07:43,405
- You've seen this guy before?
- Outside of Guero's.

1323
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:46,783
And I saw you outside of Guero's, too.

1324
02:07:46,868 --> 02:07:49,661
You saw my car, I saw your legs.

1325
02:07:49,745 --> 02:07:53,123
Now, look, I ain't stalking you all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

1326
02:07:53,207 --> 02:07:56,460
- So, you really weren't following us?
- I'm not following you, Butterfly.

1327
02:07:56,544 --> 02:07:58,962
I just got lucky.

1328
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:05,635
So, how about that lap dance?

1329
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:09,806
Sorry, it was a one time
only offer and she did it at Antoine's.

1330
02:08:11,142 --> 02:08:12,184
No, she didn't.

1331
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:16,354
- How do you know?
- I'm good that way.

1332
02:08:16,439 --> 02:08:19,357
- And you look a little touchéd.
- What's touchéd?

1333
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:21,985
- Wounded slightly.
- Why should I be wounded?

1334
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:24,905
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

1335
02:08:24,989 --> 02:08:28,950
but from your look, I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

1336
02:08:29,035 --> 02:08:31,495
That kind of hurt your feelings a bit,
didn't it?

1337
02:08:33,331 --> 02:08:38,502
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

1338
02:08:42,048 --> 02:08:43,507
So...

1339
02:08:44,967 --> 02:08:47,886
How about that lap dance?

1340
02:08:49,597 --> 02:08:52,224
I think I'm gonna have
to give you a rain check.

1341
02:08:55,228 --> 02:08:57,437
Well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days

1342
02:08:57,522 --> 02:09:00,023
that rain check will be worthless.

1343
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:03,193
But that's OK.

1344
02:09:04,445 --> 02:09:06,947
I understand if
I make you uncomfortable.

1345
02:09:07,532 --> 02:09:12,661
You're still a nice girl
and I still like you.

1346
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:15,163
But I must warn you of something...

1347
02:09:16,207 --> 02:09:20,293
You know how people say... 
"You're OK in my book?"

1348
02:09:20,378 --> 02:09:23,964
Or, "In my book, that's no good?"

1349
02:09:24,048 --> 02:09:29,219
Well, I actually have a book.

1350
02:09:29,303 --> 02:09:33,598
And everybody I ever meet
goes in this book.

1351
02:09:33,683 --> 02:09:37,769
And now I've met you
and you're going in the book.

1352
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:44,526
Except, I'm afraid I must file you...

1353
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:51,157
-...under "Chickenshit."
- And what if I did it?

1354
02:09:51,242 --> 02:09:55,870
Well, I definitely couldn't file you
under "Chickenshit" then, now could I?

1355
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:57,455
What's your name again?

1356
02:09:58,624 --> 02:10:03,295
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike, I'm Butterfly.

1357
02:10:03,379 --> 02:10:08,174
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
the jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

1358
02:10:08,259 --> 02:10:10,677
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah.

1359
02:10:11,762 --> 02:10:14,431
Why don't you go get ready
for your lap dance?

1360
02:10:28,112 --> 02:10:30,030
- I'm driving.

1361
02:10:32,199 --> 02:10:34,701
- Ready to go?
- Yeah. Bye.

1362
02:10:34,785 --> 02:10:36,620
- Bye..
- Bye.

1363
02:10:39,624 --> 02:10:42,876
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

1364
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:46,296
Looking good,
Cannonball Run!

1365
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:48,465
He's just giving me a ride.

1366
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:51,343
- Oh, no doubt.
- Have a nice ride.

1367
02:10:53,638 --> 02:10:55,639
Look, double fucks.

1368
02:10:58,476 --> 02:11:02,854
- Uh-uh, I am not gonna fuck him.
- I can hear you.

1369
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:08,068
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

1370
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:13,490
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1371
02:11:19,914 --> 02:11:21,831
Wow, that's fucking scary.

1372
02:11:21,916 --> 02:11:26,294
Yeah, well, I wanted it to be
impressive, and scary tends to impress.

1373
02:11:27,755 --> 02:11:29,381
Is it safe?

1374
02:11:29,465 --> 02:11:32,509
It's better than safe,
it's death proof.

1375
02:11:32,593 --> 02:11:35,053
How do you make a car death proof?

1376
02:11:35,137 --> 02:11:36,971
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

1377
02:11:37,056 --> 02:11:39,557
You've seen a movie where a car
gets into some smash up

1378
02:11:39,642 --> 02:11:42,310
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from.

1379
02:11:42,395 --> 02:11:45,605
- Yeah.
- How do you think they accomplish that?

1380
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:47,691
CGI?

1381
02:11:48,401 --> 02:11:52,529
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you're right.

1382
02:11:52,613 --> 02:11:55,532
Back in the all or nothing days,
the Vanishing Point days,

1383
02:11:55,616 --> 02:11:59,744
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,
the White Line Fever days,

1384
02:11:59,829 --> 02:12:05,291
real cars smashing into real cars
with real dumb people driving them.

1385
02:12:05,376 --> 02:12:08,837
So, you give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

1386
02:12:08,921 --> 02:12:12,298
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and voilà...

1387
02:12:12,383 --> 02:12:15,802
You've got yourself
a death proof automobile.

1388
02:12:17,555 --> 02:12:20,890
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death proof.

1389
02:12:20,975 --> 02:12:25,311
I can drive this baby into a brick wall
doing 125 miles an hour,

1390
02:12:25,396 --> 02:12:27,063
just for the experience.

1391
02:12:34,029 --> 02:12:36,030
Why is your passenger seat
in a box?

1392
02:12:36,115 --> 02:12:37,657
Well, this is a movie car.

1393
02:12:37,742 --> 02:12:39,576
Sometimes, when you're shooting a crash,

1394
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:43,621
director wants to put a camera in the
car, shoot the crash from the inside.

1395
02:12:43,706 --> 02:12:46,541
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a crash box. Here...

1396
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,794
- There you go.

1397
02:12:51,505 --> 02:12:53,757
When you asked to drive me home,
you didn't mention

1398
02:12:53,841 --> 02:12:55,592
your car didn't have a passenger seat.

1399
02:12:55,676 --> 02:12:58,261
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

1400
02:12:58,345 --> 02:13:01,973
You asked me for a ride and I said yes.
But look at the bright side, Pam,

1401
02:13:02,057 --> 02:13:04,684
I won't be getting fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

1402
02:13:06,771 --> 02:13:09,439
That is the bright side.

1403
02:13:09,523 --> 02:13:10,940
I thought so.

1404
02:13:36,801 --> 02:13:40,094
Well, Pam, which way you going,
left or right?

1405
02:13:40,179 --> 02:13:41,179
Right.

1406
02:13:41,305 --> 02:13:44,933
- Ah, that's too bad.
- Why?

1407
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:48,853
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you'd be going left or right.

1408
02:13:48,938 --> 02:13:51,064
See, we're both going left.

1409
02:13:51,148 --> 02:13:54,067
You could have just as easily been going
left, too, and if that was the case,

1410
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:57,111
it would have been a while
before you started gettin' scared.

1411
02:13:57,196 --> 02:13:59,656
But since you're going the other way...

1412
02:14:01,033 --> 02:14:04,035
... I'm afraid you're gonna
have to start getting scared...

1413
02:14:04,912 --> 02:14:05,912
...immediately.

1414
02:14:05,996 --> 02:14:08,998
What the fuck?!

1415
02:14:16,590 --> 02:14:18,424
You cocksucking motherfucker!

1416
02:14:18,509 --> 02:14:21,719
Fucking let me out of here!
I'll fucking rip your fucking...

1417
02:14:21,804 --> 02:14:24,180
Stop the fucking car!

1418
02:15:03,554 --> 02:15:08,016
OK, here's the thing.

1419
02:15:10,519 --> 02:15:16,232
I get it. This was all a joke,
and it's super funny.

1420
02:15:16,317 --> 02:15:19,027
It was really funny, OK?

1421
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:24,240
But, um, if you could stop now, if...

1422
02:15:24,867 --> 02:15:26,743
If you just drop me off...

1423
02:15:28,662 --> 02:15:31,039
- I swear I'll never...
- Hey, Pam!

1424
02:15:32,249 --> 02:15:35,168
Remember when I said this car
was death proof?

1425
02:15:36,295 --> 02:15:42,091
Well, that wasn't a lie.
This car is 100 percent death proof.

1426
02:15:42,176 --> 02:15:45,053
Only, to get the benefit of it, honey,

1427
02:15:45,137 --> 02:15:48,598
you really need to be sitting
in my seat.

1428
02:16:25,886 --> 02:16:29,347
Now I've gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

1429
02:16:44,029 --> 02:16:49,075
No, no, no, no, no. It's Dave Dee,
Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

1430
02:16:49,159 --> 02:16:50,952
So, you got it?

1431
02:16:51,036 --> 02:16:54,664
Thanks honey. You're gonna
play it next song, right?

1432
02:16:54,748 --> 02:16:56,541
Good boy.

1433
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:59,919
Growl.

1434
02:17:00,004 --> 02:17:01,879
Bye-bye.

1435
02:17:01,964 --> 02:17:03,589
Who do you want to hear?

1436
02:17:03,674 --> 02:17:05,341
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

1437
02:17:05,426 --> 02:17:06,676
Who?

1438
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:09,804
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

1439
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:13,016
- Who the fuck are they?
- For your information,

1440
02:17:13,100 --> 02:17:15,935
Pete Townshend, at one point,
almost quit The Who,

1441
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:17,854
and if he had, he would have
ended up in this group

1442
02:17:17,938 --> 02:17:22,108
thus making it Dave Dee,
Dozy, Beaky, Mitch, Tich and Pete.

1443
02:17:22,192 --> 02:17:24,777
And if you ask me,
he should have.

1444
02:17:24,862 --> 02:17:27,739
- That's my boy!

1445
02:19:15,264 --> 02:19:18,266
I wanna to hear
this part of the song louder!

1446
02:20:05,939 --> 02:20:07,982
Do you know her name or anything?

1447
02:20:09,151 --> 02:20:11,903
Uh, I don't remember.

1448
02:20:15,115 --> 02:20:17,116
Dr. Block?

1449
02:20:23,332 --> 02:20:26,000
Self restraints to room 310.

1450
02:20:26,084 --> 02:20:29,712
Self restraints to room 310.

1451
02:20:29,796 --> 02:20:35,051
Well, what's the patient's prognosis,
Dr. Block?

1452
02:20:35,135 --> 02:20:37,303
I don't really see it's
any of your business.

1453
02:20:37,387 --> 02:20:41,641
Come on now, sis.
You just tell us.

1454
02:20:41,725 --> 02:20:42,808
How bad is he?

1455
02:20:47,689 --> 02:20:49,523
He got banged up real good.

1456
02:20:49,608 --> 02:20:53,611
Busted nose, broken collar bone,
smashed up his left index finger.

1457
02:20:54,363 --> 02:20:55,571
Is that it?

1458
02:20:57,241 --> 02:20:58,783
He was real lucky.

1459
02:21:01,161 --> 02:21:02,495
That will be all?

1460
02:21:02,579 --> 02:21:05,998
Why, that's more than enough
and I want to thank you, Dr. Block.

1461
02:21:10,254 --> 02:21:11,754
Son of a bitch!

1462
02:21:12,839 --> 02:21:15,758
So, Pop, what do you think?

1463
02:21:16,218 --> 02:21:18,302
Well, son number one...

1464
02:21:18,387 --> 02:21:22,515
...what I think is so goddamn ghoulish,
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

1465
02:21:23,433 --> 02:21:24,809
Well, give it a shot.

1466
02:21:25,686 --> 02:21:28,813
Well, what we have here is
a case of vehicular homicide.

1467
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:31,357
That old boy murdered them
pretty little gals.

1468
02:21:31,441 --> 02:21:35,611
He used a car and not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.

1469
02:21:36,989 --> 02:21:39,782
Well, what are you gonna do?

1470
02:21:39,866 --> 02:21:41,909
Not a goddamn thing.

1471
02:21:41,994 --> 02:21:44,370
DA says there ain't no crime here.

1472
02:21:44,955 --> 02:21:49,750
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floating on weed

1473
02:21:49,835 --> 02:21:53,629
and old Hooper in there came out
clean as a whistle.

1474
02:21:54,172 --> 02:21:57,925
Now you actually think that he
premeditatedly murdered them gals?

1475
02:21:58,010 --> 02:22:01,721
Well, I can't prove it but since
thinking don't cost nothing,

1476
02:22:01,805 --> 02:22:03,556
I can think it and I do.

1477
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:07,059
Yeah, but Pop, he got pretty
banged up himself.

1478
02:22:07,144 --> 02:22:10,396
Hell, yeah, he got banged up,
but goddamn, them pretty little gals

1479
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:13,941
look like a goddamn giant chewed
them up and spit them out.

1480
02:22:14,026 --> 02:22:15,401
Did any of them survive?

1481
02:22:15,485 --> 02:22:19,697
Shit, two tons of metal
at 200 miles an hour,

1482
02:22:19,781 --> 02:22:22,742
flesh and bone and plain old Newton...

1483
02:22:22,826 --> 02:22:24,952
...they all princess died.

1484
02:22:27,539 --> 02:22:28,873
Why?

1485
02:22:30,042 --> 02:22:33,294
Well, I'd guesstimate it's a sex thing.

1486
02:22:34,296 --> 02:22:36,088
Only way I can figure it.

1487
02:22:36,173 --> 02:22:41,010
High velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

1488
02:22:41,094 --> 02:22:45,097
all four souls taken
exactly at the same time.

1489
02:22:45,182 --> 02:22:49,769
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

1490
02:22:55,567 --> 02:22:57,485
You're timing couldn't be better, Zoë.

1491
02:22:57,569 --> 02:23:00,696
It just so happens that
we're all three off-duty

1492
02:23:00,781 --> 02:23:04,784
- for the next three days of shooting.
- Fucking hell, how does that happen?

1493
02:23:04,868 --> 02:23:07,661
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's make-up
and she's off for the next three days.

1494
02:23:07,746 --> 02:23:10,748
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free

1495
02:23:10,832 --> 02:23:14,960
and Lee's on a "will notify"
for the next four days.

1496
02:23:15,045 --> 02:23:16,879
So, how's the shoot going?

1497
02:23:16,963 --> 02:23:18,714
Great! We're having the best time.

1498
02:23:18,799 --> 02:23:21,050
The director, Cecil Evans,
is so much fun.

1499
02:23:21,134 --> 02:23:24,345
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

1500
02:23:24,429 --> 02:23:27,890
Hell, yeah. The next job after
this one is definitely gonna suck.

1501
02:23:27,974 --> 02:23:32,478
So, let's hear it ladies. Set romances?
Who's getting it off?

1502
02:23:32,562 --> 02:23:34,647
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

1503
02:23:34,731 --> 02:23:38,109
Oh, Toolbox?
The name sounds promising.

1504
02:23:38,193 --> 02:23:40,319
- He's a grip.
- What he is, is a pervert.

1505
02:23:40,404 --> 02:23:43,906
Well, he just keeps
sounding better and better.

1506
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:44,990
What's his perversion?

1507
02:23:47,285 --> 02:23:48,994
He like to watch me pee.

1508
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:54,542
Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee!

1509
02:23:54,626 --> 02:23:58,379
P-I-S-S-I-N-G..

1510
02:23:58,463 --> 02:24:02,425
Yeah, but not no more.
Now she's getting it on with The Rock.

1511
02:24:02,509 --> 02:24:05,136
- You're having one off with The Rock?
- Not the real Rock.

1512
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:07,763
He's this electrician named Bruce.
Kim started calling him The Rock

1513
02:24:07,848 --> 02:24:10,808
because he kinda looks like The Rock
so we all just call him The Rock.

1514
02:24:10,892 --> 02:24:13,352
Kim, dick department. Let's hear it.

1515
02:24:13,437 --> 02:24:15,312
Uh-uh, no dick this trip.

1516
02:24:15,397 --> 02:24:18,607
- I got a man.
- How long have you had this boyfriend?

1517
02:24:18,692 --> 02:24:21,944
- About three months.
- Who'd you steal him from?

1518
02:24:22,028 --> 02:24:23,028
Nobody!

1519
02:24:23,113 --> 02:24:25,531
- Kim!!
- What?

1520
02:24:25,615 --> 02:24:27,992
He totally had a girlfriend.

1521
02:24:28,076 --> 02:24:31,287
All Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

1522
02:24:31,371 --> 02:24:33,372
I did not steal him.

1523
02:24:33,457 --> 02:24:38,169
I didn't steal any of them.
They just... jumped ship.

1524
02:24:40,839 --> 02:24:44,717
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big kahuna.

1525
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:47,595
I had a set crush on Cecil.

1526
02:24:47,679 --> 02:24:50,806
"Set crush?" Nigga, please.
You were his set wife.

1527
02:24:50,891 --> 02:24:53,058
"Were" and "had" being
the key words here.

1528
02:24:53,143 --> 02:24:55,853
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

1529
02:24:55,937 --> 02:24:57,605
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,

1530
02:24:57,689 --> 02:25:00,566
then why did he fuck
Daryl Hannah's stand-in?

1531
02:25:04,488 --> 02:25:08,240
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

1532
02:25:08,325 --> 02:25:11,076
- Oh, it's so funny!
- Oh, stop acting all hurt.

1533
02:25:11,161 --> 02:25:12,369
Your ass is just mad.

1534
02:25:12,454 --> 02:25:15,956
- Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.
- Bitch, you need to get over that shit.

1535
02:25:16,041 --> 02:25:20,085
- That was two weeks ago.
- Oh, well, now you put it like that...

1536
02:25:21,213 --> 02:25:26,509
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.
He fucked her on my birthday.

1537
02:25:26,593 --> 02:25:29,512
Oh, that's a horse
of a different color.

1538
02:25:29,596 --> 02:25:30,930
Thank you.

1539
02:25:31,014 --> 02:25:35,518
Did he know it was your birthday?
He's the director. He's kind of busy.

1540
02:25:35,602 --> 02:25:39,855
He ate a piece of my birthday cake
and he got me a present.

1541
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:41,899
Yeah, I think he knew.

1542
02:25:43,610 --> 02:25:45,319
What did he get you?

1543
02:25:48,907 --> 02:25:50,241
He made me a tape.

1544
02:25:50,325 --> 02:25:52,868
He made you a tape?

1545
02:25:52,953 --> 02:25:55,246
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD,
he made you a tape?

1546
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:58,624
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic.

1547
02:25:58,708 --> 02:26:01,919
Yes, I know what you're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

1548
02:26:02,003 --> 02:26:04,046
Sounds like the test
of true love to me.

1549
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:06,423
Look, I know you guys like him.

1550
02:26:06,508 --> 02:26:07,800
He's likeable.

1551
02:26:07,884 --> 02:26:10,636
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

1552
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:12,388
How can you not be on my side?

1553
02:26:12,472 --> 02:26:15,808
- Well, I admit, that sounds bad.
- It is bad.

1554
02:26:15,892 --> 02:26:18,727
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

1555
02:26:18,812 --> 02:26:21,480
- Were you two fucking?
- Hell, no.

1556
02:26:21,565 --> 02:26:24,483
- Hello, is your name Abernathy?
- Sorry.

1557
02:26:24,568 --> 02:26:28,112
The answer to your question is no.
Of course not.

1558
02:26:28,905 --> 02:26:32,658
- What do you mean, "No, of course not?"
- The reason Cecil hasn't had

1559
02:26:32,742 --> 02:26:36,120
a girlfriend in six years
is because girls will fuck him.

1560
02:26:36,204 --> 02:26:39,540
And if you fuck Cecil,
you don't become one of his girlfriends.

1561
02:26:39,624 --> 02:26:45,588
Not to say I want to be his girlfriend,
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,

1562
02:26:45,672 --> 02:26:50,759
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be his
girlfriend. I'd be one of his regulars.

1563
02:26:50,844 --> 02:26:54,054
And I'm just getting
too fucking old for that shit.

1564
02:26:54,139 --> 02:26:57,683
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

1565
02:26:58,935 --> 02:27:02,896
I've let him give me a foot massage
and when we go to the movies,

1566
02:27:02,981 --> 02:27:04,398
I've let him hold my hand.

1567
02:27:04,482 --> 02:27:07,526
Bitch, you might be acting
like you're 12 years old,

1568
02:27:07,611 --> 02:27:09,278
but he just acting like a man.

1569
02:27:09,362 --> 02:27:11,530
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

1570
02:27:11,615 --> 02:27:13,699
Let me get this straight.

1571
02:27:13,783 --> 02:27:15,451
- You're not fucking him.
- Hm-hm.

1572
02:27:15,535 --> 02:27:17,119
- You're not sucking him.
- Hm-hm.

1573
02:27:17,203 --> 02:27:21,624
You're not giving him any tongue,
but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is?

1574
02:27:21,708 --> 02:27:24,418
You know, some cultures
might say he made the wiser choice.

1575
02:27:24,502 --> 02:27:27,796
Oh!

1576
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:33,552
So, Zoë, Kim, and I are in the
Philippines at an outdoor rave.

1577
02:27:33,637 --> 02:27:36,764
- What were you working on??
- Three Kicks to the Head, part three.

1578
02:27:36,848 --> 02:27:40,267
And admittedly,
we were a little fucked up.

1579
02:27:40,352 --> 02:27:42,311
- Cheers to that..
- Word.

1580
02:27:43,647 --> 02:27:44,730
Cheers.

1581
02:27:44,814 --> 02:27:50,778
So Zoë, the genius,
wants to take a picture of me.

1582
02:27:52,530 --> 02:27:55,574
It's dark as hell
and you can't see shit.

1583
02:27:55,659 --> 02:27:59,453
So, she's got her camera and keeps
saying, "Step back a little."

1584
02:27:59,537 --> 02:28:00,663
So I do.

1585
02:28:00,747 --> 02:28:04,958
Then, "A little further."
So I step back a little further.

1586
02:28:05,043 --> 02:28:08,295
Then, "A little more." So, I do.

1587
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:14,093
Then I realize, I'm right at the edge
of a seven foot concrete ditch.

1588
02:28:14,177 --> 02:28:18,639
With God knows how many rocks,
and broken bottles, and rats in it.

1589
02:28:18,723 --> 02:28:20,599
And, if I fell in that fucking thing,

1590
02:28:20,684 --> 02:28:22,685
I probably would have
broken my fucking neck.

1591
02:28:22,769 --> 02:28:26,438
So I'm yelling at her,
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

1592
02:28:28,108 --> 02:28:32,194
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

1593
02:28:32,278 --> 02:28:34,822
and Zoë starts fuckin' around.

1594
02:28:34,906 --> 02:28:39,118
And damn if she doesn't
fall in the fucking ditch.

1595
02:28:40,537 --> 02:28:42,871
- Nice..
- Nice.

1596
02:28:42,956 --> 02:28:44,748
Thank you. Yeah, thank you.

1597
02:28:44,833 --> 02:28:48,711
I remember taking a step
and looking down.

1598
02:28:48,795 --> 02:28:52,089
Just as I'm thinking, "There's that
ditch Abbie was talking about."

1599
02:28:52,173 --> 02:28:54,633
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

1600
02:28:54,718 --> 02:28:58,429
- What happened?
- What, with Zoë the cat?

1601
02:28:58,513 --> 02:29:01,306
Nothing. If I fell in that fucking thing

1602
02:29:01,391 --> 02:29:03,642
they would've had to helicopter me
out of there.

1603
02:29:03,727 --> 02:29:05,811
Zoë just lands on her feet.

1604
02:29:05,895 --> 02:29:10,149
But then, later, I started feeling
a little bad about myself.

1605
02:29:10,233 --> 02:29:15,237
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing,
we're laughing about it.

1606
02:29:15,321 --> 02:29:17,531
If I fell in that fucking thing...

1607
02:29:17,615 --> 02:29:20,159
... I probably would have been
fucking paralyzed.

1608
02:29:20,243 --> 02:29:23,787
Honey, you can't think like that.
We all have our individual talents

1609
02:29:23,872 --> 02:29:25,789
and that just happens to be
one of Zoë's.

1610
02:29:25,874 --> 02:29:28,584
- Well, physically speaking,

1611
02:29:28,668 --> 02:29:34,006
Zoë is amazing. I mean,
agility, reflexes, nimbleness.

1612
02:29:34,090 --> 02:29:37,176
There's few human beings that
can fuck with Zoë on that front.

1613
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:39,762
- Kim, I like you, too.
- Aw...

1614
02:29:40,263 --> 02:29:44,683
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoë's prowess,

1615
02:29:44,768 --> 02:29:47,478
you're missing the most
important part of that story.

1616
02:29:47,562 --> 02:29:51,106
You didn't fall in the ditch. Zoë did.

1617
02:29:51,191 --> 02:29:54,860
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her

1618
02:29:54,944 --> 02:29:57,070
and she still fell in.

1619
02:29:57,155 --> 02:30:00,324
So, Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1620
02:30:00,408 --> 02:30:04,912
Hey, I resemble that remark.

1621
02:30:06,664 --> 02:30:08,957
So Kim, you still pack a roscoe?

1622
02:30:12,045 --> 02:30:14,046
Check it out, bitch.

1623
02:30:14,130 --> 02:30:16,590
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I noticed.

1624
02:30:16,674 --> 02:30:18,801
- What's a roscoe??
- Roscoe is a pistol.

1625
02:30:19,803 --> 02:30:21,970
- You carry a gun??
- Uh-huh.

1626
02:30:22,055 --> 02:30:23,847
You have a license to carry it?

1627
02:30:23,932 --> 02:30:28,435
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

1628
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:30,646
Oh, I didn't know you were...

1629
02:30:33,024 --> 02:30:36,068
OK, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me, I didn't say it.

1630
02:30:36,152 --> 02:30:39,488
God. Did you know
Kim carried a gun?

1631
02:30:39,989 --> 02:30:44,326
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

1632
02:30:44,410 --> 02:30:46,453
Do I know? Yes.

1633
02:30:46,538 --> 02:30:50,165
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

1634
02:30:50,250 --> 02:30:53,085
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

1635
02:30:53,169 --> 02:30:57,798
You can't get around the fact that
people who carry guns tend to get shot

1636
02:30:57,882 --> 02:30:59,424
more than people who don't.

1637
02:30:59,509 --> 02:31:02,636
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

1638
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:06,557
in my building at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

1639
02:31:06,641 --> 02:31:09,685
- Don't do your laundry at midnight.
- Fuck that, I want to do my laundry

1640
02:31:09,769 --> 02:31:11,937
whenever the fuck
I want to do my laundry.

1641
02:31:12,021 --> 02:31:15,065
There are other things
you can carry other than a gun.

1642
02:31:15,149 --> 02:31:16,483
Pepper spray.

1643
02:31:16,568 --> 02:31:20,612
Uh, a motherfucker try to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

1644
02:31:20,697 --> 02:31:24,199
- I wanna shut that nigga down.

1645
02:31:24,284 --> 02:31:26,702
How about a knife, at least?

1646
02:31:26,786 --> 02:31:29,872
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers who carry knives?

1647
02:31:30,957 --> 02:31:33,083
They get shot.

1648
02:31:33,167 --> 02:31:37,504
Look, if I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

1649
02:31:37,589 --> 02:31:40,090
I'll hire me a do-dirt-nigga
and he'll carry the gun.

1650
02:31:40,174 --> 02:31:42,009
And when shit goes down,
I'll sit back and laugh.

1651
02:31:42,093 --> 02:31:44,970
But until that day,
it's wild west, motherfucker.

1652
02:31:45,054 --> 02:31:48,724
So Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

1653
02:31:49,767 --> 02:31:53,312
It just so happens,
I know exactly what I want to do.

1654
02:31:53,396 --> 02:31:56,982
Oh, really? And what would that be?

1655
02:31:57,066 --> 02:31:59,151
To me, there's no point
in being in America

1656
02:31:59,235 --> 02:32:01,486
unless you can drive
a Detroit muscle car.

1657
02:32:01,571 --> 02:32:05,866
And I want to drive a Dodge Challenger,
fuck me, swinging balls out.

1658
02:32:08,036 --> 02:32:11,204
Um... Well, I guess
we could talk to transpo.

1659
02:32:11,289 --> 02:32:13,999
But does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

1660
02:32:14,083 --> 02:32:19,212
Not just that, it has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

1661
02:32:22,342 --> 02:32:25,761
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

1662
02:32:25,845 --> 02:32:29,348
No worries, mate.
I've got it all worked out.

1663
02:32:29,432 --> 02:32:32,517
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

1664
02:32:32,602 --> 02:32:36,188
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

1665
02:32:36,272 --> 02:32:38,148
- So back home...
- I'm sorry. Where's home?

1666
02:32:38,232 --> 02:32:43,111
- Australia, right?
- What do you mean by that, mate?

1667
02:32:43,780 --> 02:32:47,157
Zoë's from New Zealand and you never,

1668
02:32:47,241 --> 02:32:50,827
I repeat, never call a Kiwi an Aussie.

1669
02:32:50,912 --> 02:32:53,538
That is, unless you want
your ass kicked.

1670
02:32:54,999 --> 02:32:57,918
I'm so sorry. I really am.

1671
02:32:58,002 --> 02:33:01,797
Oh, that's OK. We're just taking
the piss out of you, mate.

1672
02:33:03,132 --> 02:33:05,759
Auckland, to answer your question.

1673
02:33:06,302 --> 02:33:08,971
Anyway, I subscribed to
the local paper a month ago.

1674
02:33:09,055 --> 02:33:12,683
Now why in the fuck you want a local
redneck newspaper in New Zealand?

1675
02:33:12,767 --> 02:33:15,060
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

1676
02:33:15,144 --> 02:33:17,104
I've been getting
the paper for the last month

1677
02:33:17,188 --> 02:33:20,023
and I've been checking the classified
at the back looking at cars for sale.

1678
02:33:20,108 --> 02:33:23,402
So, as of yesterday, for sale,

1679
02:33:23,486 --> 02:33:26,571
in this town,
some dude is selling a stock

1680
02:33:26,656 --> 02:33:32,160
1970 Dodge Challenger with
a 440 engine and a white paint job.

1681
02:33:32,245 --> 02:33:34,413
And you want to buy it?

1682
02:33:35,164 --> 02:33:39,001
Kim, I may be stupid
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1683
02:33:39,085 --> 02:33:42,879
I want to say I want to buy it
so he'll let me test drive it.

1684
02:33:42,964 --> 02:33:46,383
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

1685
02:33:46,467 --> 02:33:47,801
Oh, Kowalski.

1686
02:33:47,885 --> 02:33:52,055
Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic.

1687
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:54,224
If I can get this guy to let me
drive it without him,

1688
02:33:54,308 --> 02:33:57,060
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

1689
02:33:57,145 --> 02:33:58,854
What's Vanishing Point?

1690
02:34:00,023 --> 02:34:02,190
What's Vanishing Point?

1691
02:34:02,275 --> 02:34:05,068
Abs, I'm supposed to be
the illiterate one.

1692
02:34:05,153 --> 02:34:08,071
It's just one of the best American
movies ever made.

1693
02:34:08,156 --> 02:34:11,742
Actually, Zoë, most girls wouldn't
know Vanishing Point.

1694
02:34:12,952 --> 02:34:16,955
Excuse me, "most girls?"
What the fuck are you two?

1695
02:34:17,040 --> 02:34:20,375
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

1696
02:34:20,460 --> 02:34:22,627
Y'all grew up watching that
Pretty in Pink shit.

1697
02:34:22,712 --> 02:34:24,796
Oh, I like Pretty in Pink.

1698
02:34:25,548 --> 02:34:27,841
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

1699
02:34:27,925 --> 02:34:31,928
Of course, I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too.

1700
02:34:32,013 --> 02:34:37,309
Vanishing Point, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry,
Gone in 60 Seconds, the real one.

1701
02:34:37,393 --> 02:34:39,561
Not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.

1702
02:34:39,645 --> 02:34:41,271
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland

1703
02:34:41,355 --> 02:34:44,232
that plays Vanishing Point,
Big Wednesday,

1704
02:34:44,317 --> 02:34:46,818
all the classics.

1705
02:35:02,418 --> 02:35:04,169
What do you horny gals want?

1706
02:35:08,049 --> 02:35:11,259
Yeah, you got a 1970
Dodge Challenger for sale?

1707
02:35:11,344 --> 02:35:13,303
Right up here, ladies.

1708
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:33,198
- This shit is off the fuckin' hook.
- Fuckin' legendary, mate.

1709
02:35:35,576 --> 02:35:38,370
Sweet as.
Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment,

1710
02:35:38,454 --> 02:35:40,539
I'd like to have a word alone
with my business associate.

1711
02:35:40,623 --> 02:35:43,166
- You ladies take your time.
- OK.

1712
02:35:45,461 --> 02:35:46,920
Mmm.

1713
02:35:48,881 --> 02:35:51,883
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

1714
02:35:51,968 --> 02:35:54,678
I intend to. But first,
I need to ask you something.

1715
02:35:54,762 --> 02:35:56,054
What?

1716
02:35:56,139 --> 02:36:01,059
If he let's us take it out on our own,
I want to play Ship's Mast.

1717
02:36:01,144 --> 02:36:03,061
- Oh, hell no!
- Will you keep it down?

1718
02:36:03,146 --> 02:36:05,397
- Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.
- For Christ's sake...

1719
02:36:05,481 --> 02:36:07,232
- Don't blaspheme.
- Sorry.

1720
02:36:07,316 --> 02:36:10,360
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

1721
02:36:10,444 --> 02:36:13,238
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

1722
02:36:13,322 --> 02:36:14,948
I know I said we shouldn't
do this again...

1723
02:36:15,032 --> 02:36:17,701
No, you didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever

1724
02:36:17,785 --> 02:36:19,286
- gonna to do that again.
- But...

1725
02:36:19,370 --> 02:36:23,707
"But," my ass! You said, not only are
we never gonna play Ship's Mast again,

1726
02:36:23,791 --> 02:36:26,710
but you also said, if you ever do
what you're trying to do now,

1727
02:36:26,794 --> 02:36:27,961
to not only refuse,

1728
02:36:28,045 --> 02:36:31,840
but that I had permission to physically
restrain your ass if necessary.

1729
02:36:31,924 --> 02:36:34,176
Now, did you or did you not say that?

1730
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:35,886
- Well...
- No, no, no, no.

1731
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:39,556
Answer the question, motherfucker.
Did you or did you not say that?

1732
02:36:39,640 --> 02:36:43,351
- Yes, I said that, however...
- Whatever with your "however."

1733
02:36:45,188 --> 02:36:47,397
I know I said it,
and I know I meant it.

1734
02:36:47,481 --> 02:36:48,523
Damn skippy, you meant it.

1735
02:36:48,608 --> 02:36:51,401
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America.

1736
02:36:51,485 --> 02:36:53,195
- Oh, nigga, please!
- Really.

1737
02:36:53,279 --> 02:36:57,490
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand and Australia.

1738
02:36:57,575 --> 02:36:59,910
You are such a liar.

1739
02:36:59,994 --> 02:37:02,537
Look, I know what I said when I said it.

1740
02:37:02,622 --> 02:37:04,915
But when I said it, I didn't know
I'd ever come to America.

1741
02:37:04,999 --> 02:37:07,792
And when I said it, if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

1742
02:37:07,877 --> 02:37:10,128
and have the opportunity
to play Ship's Mast on the fucking

1743
02:37:10,213 --> 02:37:14,341
Vanishing Point Challenger,
I would have added a "however."

1744
02:37:15,218 --> 02:37:16,676
Right?

1745
02:37:21,724 --> 02:37:24,476
OK, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

1746
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:26,102
However...

1747
02:37:26,187 --> 02:37:28,855
Just because you talked yourself
into some stupid shit,

1748
02:37:28,940 --> 02:37:31,191
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

1749
02:37:31,275 --> 02:37:34,694
You need two people
to play Ship's Mast and I ain't playing.

1750
02:37:42,578 --> 02:37:43,995
I'll be your best friend.

1751
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:47,082
I don't need me no best friend who
lives on the other side of planet Earth.

1752
02:37:47,917 --> 02:37:50,835
- I'll crack your back.
- You'll crack it anyway.

1753
02:37:50,920 --> 02:37:53,338
Well, of course,
I'll crack it anyway.

1754
02:37:53,422 --> 02:37:57,342
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

1755
02:37:57,426 --> 02:38:00,053
Whenever you want it, you got it.
You don't even have to ask for it.

1756
02:38:00,137 --> 02:38:01,388
You just order me to do it.

1757
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:04,099
Just be like,
"Bitch get over here and get busy."

1758
02:38:09,188 --> 02:38:11,773
So... We're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him.

1759
02:38:11,857 --> 02:38:15,026
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

1760
02:38:15,611 --> 02:38:16,611
What?

1761
02:38:16,696 --> 02:38:19,614
I said, we're gonna see if this guy will
let us take the car out without him...

1762
02:38:19,699 --> 02:38:24,577
I heard what you said.
I just can't believe what you said.

1763
02:38:25,955 --> 02:38:27,664
You know, you two got
some fuckin' balls.

1764
02:38:27,748 --> 02:38:30,917
- What?
- Don't play dumb ass with me.

1765
02:38:31,002 --> 02:38:35,922
I've been up all night, I'm still a
little drunk, and I have a hangover.

1766
02:38:36,007 --> 02:38:39,259
I should be in my hotel room asleep.
Not fucking around here on tobacco road,

1767
02:38:39,343 --> 02:38:43,388
but because Zoë wanted to drive some
fucking Vanishing Point car, I'm here.

1768
02:38:43,472 --> 02:38:45,056
Now you two got the balls to ask me...

1769
02:38:45,141 --> 02:38:49,102
No, scratch that, tell me,
I gotta go make conversation

1770
02:38:49,186 --> 02:38:51,688
with Tom Joad while the cool kids
get to go out and play?

1771
02:38:51,772 --> 02:38:53,732
Bullshit on that.

1772
02:38:53,816 --> 02:38:56,026
- It ain't like that.
- Then what's it like, Kim?

1773
02:38:56,110 --> 02:39:00,113
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

1774
02:39:00,197 --> 02:39:03,700
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

1775
02:39:04,785 --> 02:39:06,745
You're not gonna want to do
what we're doing.

1776
02:39:06,829 --> 02:39:08,580
What? To drive a car?

1777
02:39:08,664 --> 02:39:12,083
- We're doing more than that.
- What? Drive it fast?

1778
02:39:12,168 --> 02:39:14,753
We're doing more than that.

1779
02:39:14,837 --> 02:39:19,549
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
because we're gonna do some stupid shit.

1780
02:39:21,677 --> 02:39:23,928
But that's OK. We're stunt people,
we ain't got good sense.

1781
02:39:24,013 --> 02:39:26,306
But you got good sense.
And anyone with good sense

1782
02:39:26,390 --> 02:39:29,559
- ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing.
- How do you know I don't wanna do it?

1783
02:39:29,643 --> 02:39:33,063
- 'Cause you're a mom.
- Yeah.

1784
02:39:35,107 --> 02:39:39,486
You know, we're supposed to be
this big posse, but that's the excuse

1785
02:39:39,570 --> 02:39:42,489
you guys use whenever
you want to exclude me from something.

1786
02:39:42,573 --> 02:39:45,492
So, what is it you two
daredevils are doing

1787
02:39:45,576 --> 02:39:49,829
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand.

1788
02:39:49,914 --> 02:39:53,541
You know, we're kind of conning this
guy so maybe it's best

1789
02:39:53,626 --> 02:39:56,127
if we don't go into detail about it
while he's watching us.

1790
02:39:56,212 --> 02:40:00,965
Besides, he's probably not gonna
let us do it anyway.

1791
02:40:03,928 --> 02:40:07,764
OK, how about this?

1792
02:40:07,848 --> 02:40:11,017
I'll talk him into it.
But if I talk him into it, I go along.

1793
02:40:12,311 --> 02:40:15,480
- How are you gonna do that?
- Ah! That's my problem.

1794
02:40:15,564 --> 02:40:19,818
But don't worry.
He'll say yes.

1795
02:40:19,902 --> 02:40:23,571
- What are you gonna do, blow him?
- No!

1796
02:40:24,698 --> 02:40:27,158
I'm gonna insinuate that Lee's
gonna blow him.

1797
02:40:31,205 --> 02:40:33,206
That's a good one.

1798
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:37,001
Not really. But let me handle it.

1799
02:40:37,795 --> 02:40:38,795
We got a deal?

1800
02:40:43,050 --> 02:40:44,592
OK, mommy, listen up.

1801
02:40:45,386 --> 02:40:48,471
You wanna hang with the cool kids,
you've got to be cool.

1802
02:40:48,556 --> 02:40:51,099
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

1803
02:40:51,183 --> 02:40:53,351
You just sit in the back and I don't
want to hear a peep out of your ass.

1804
02:40:53,436 --> 02:40:54,853
- You understand?
- Got it.

1805
02:40:54,937 --> 02:40:58,022
I'm serious. You start nagging us, we're
pulling over to the side of the road

1806
02:40:58,107 --> 02:40:59,774
kicking your ass out
and picking you up later.

1807
02:41:00,359 --> 02:41:01,693
Agreed.

1808
02:41:05,239 --> 02:41:06,614
OK.

1809
02:41:06,699 --> 02:41:08,158
Go work your magic.

1810
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:16,583
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1811
02:41:16,667 --> 02:41:18,084
- What's your name?
- Jasper.

1812
02:41:18,169 --> 02:41:20,462
- Hello, Jasper. I'm Abernathy.
- Aber-what?

1813
02:41:20,546 --> 02:41:22,464
- Abernathy.
- What's your first name?

1814
02:41:22,548 --> 02:41:25,258
- That is my first name.
- What kind of first name is that?

1815
02:41:25,342 --> 02:41:29,095
- You know what? Just call me Abbie.
- OK, Abbie.

1816
02:41:30,181 --> 02:41:33,766
Jasper, we were wondering if my friends
and I could take the car out

1817
02:41:33,851 --> 02:41:36,978
for a little test drive out on our own.
Just to see if we're comfortable in it.

1818
02:41:37,062 --> 02:41:38,813
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

1819
02:41:38,898 --> 02:41:41,191
To better sell your automobile.

1820
02:41:41,275 --> 02:41:43,485
How do I know y'all
ain't just gonna steal it?

1821
02:41:43,569 --> 02:41:45,612
Four reasons, actually.

1822
02:41:45,696 --> 02:41:50,492
One, we're not thieves.
Two, that would be rude.

1823
02:41:50,576 --> 02:41:53,912
Three, we're staying at the Days Inn
in town, you can call the hotel,

1824
02:41:53,996 --> 02:41:56,539
check with management.
We're registered for the next month.

1825
02:41:56,624 --> 02:42:01,044
Actually, Zoë is not, but Kim and I are.
So, we're totally track down-able.

1826
02:42:01,128 --> 02:42:03,213
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

1827
02:42:04,256 --> 02:42:08,760
Yes, Kim would be the girl of color.
And reason number four,

1828
02:42:08,844 --> 02:42:12,972
and the most important, while we're
taking the car out for a little spin,

1829
02:42:13,057 --> 02:42:16,017
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted

1830
02:42:16,101 --> 02:42:19,103
with our other friend, Lee.

1831
02:42:22,942 --> 02:42:24,943
Why does she look kinda familiar?

1832
02:42:25,027 --> 02:42:27,946
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

1833
02:42:30,366 --> 02:42:31,658
Why's she dressed like that?

1834
02:42:31,742 --> 02:42:34,744
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

1835
02:42:34,828 --> 02:42:38,164
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

1836
02:42:38,249 --> 02:42:42,001
- What's a cheerleader movie?
- A movie about cheerleaders.

1837
02:42:42,753 --> 02:42:43,962
Is it a porno movie?

1838
02:42:45,631 --> 02:42:48,383
Yes, it is.

1839
02:42:48,467 --> 02:42:51,719
But, don't mention it. She's shy.

1840
02:42:55,975 --> 02:42:59,060
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

1841
02:42:59,144 --> 02:43:01,312
You two kids stay out of trouble.

1842
02:43:01,397 --> 02:43:04,482
Hey, good-looking!
Be back to pick you up later!

1843
02:43:04,567 --> 02:43:05,984
Ta-ta.

1844
02:43:16,161 --> 02:43:17,370
Gulp.

1845
02:43:32,428 --> 02:43:34,512
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1846
02:43:35,472 --> 02:43:38,308
- I think I'm thinking it.
- What are you and you thinking?

1847
02:43:38,392 --> 02:43:41,769
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

1848
02:43:44,481 --> 02:43:46,524
- Where are y'all going?
- You stay put.

1849
02:43:46,609 --> 02:43:47,942
I got to take a...

1850
02:44:05,294 --> 02:44:06,961
So you ready to do this?

1851
02:44:08,464 --> 02:44:10,006
You sure?

1852
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:13,259
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

1853
02:44:13,344 --> 02:44:14,344
You know what I mean?

1854
02:44:14,428 --> 02:44:16,846
Yeah, I know what you mean.
'Cause I don't want to do it.

1855
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:19,057
- Kim.
- I'm just saying.

1856
02:44:19,141 --> 02:44:22,518
- If you're gonna take the piss out...
- I'm just saying.

1857
02:44:24,188 --> 02:44:26,147
You wanna start out on top?

1858
02:44:27,149 --> 02:44:30,985
It practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

1859
02:44:35,783 --> 02:44:36,991
Here are your gloves.

1860
02:44:44,166 --> 02:44:47,126
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing the jacket.

1861
02:44:47,211 --> 02:44:48,711
This is my jacket.

1862
02:44:48,796 --> 02:44:53,007
Um... Ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

1863
02:44:53,092 --> 02:44:54,092
Give it.

1864
02:44:54,176 --> 02:44:56,594
I'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet.

1865
02:44:56,679 --> 02:44:58,888
Bonnet, my ass. You're on the hood.

1866
02:45:08,190 --> 02:45:10,483
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.

1867
02:45:10,567 --> 02:45:13,027
- Give me your belt.
- Oh.

1868
02:45:16,532 --> 02:45:18,324
This is my cute shit.

1869
02:45:19,535 --> 02:45:22,203
Well... Fuck that.
Get Abernathy's belt.

1870
02:45:23,288 --> 02:45:25,248
Fine. We'll use Abbie's belt.

1871
02:45:30,546 --> 02:45:32,588
- Give me your belt.
- No.

1872
02:45:32,673 --> 02:45:35,049
- Prada.
- Come on. Give her the belt.

1873
02:45:35,134 --> 02:45:39,053
- Magic word.
- Please. Give her the belt.

1874
02:45:39,847 --> 02:45:41,681
Just cause you asked nicely.

1875
02:45:44,309 --> 02:45:46,018
It's nice to be nice, Kim.

1876
02:45:46,895 --> 02:45:49,147
- Whatever.
- You know what?

1877
02:45:49,231 --> 02:45:52,358
Don't even fucking think about asking me
next time you want me to do your hair.

1878
02:45:52,443 --> 02:45:54,777
- Your ass gonna do it.
- Yeah, you'll ask pretty please, bitch.

1879
02:45:54,862 --> 02:45:56,779
'Cause that's what you do
when no one else is looking.

1880
02:45:56,864 --> 02:45:58,865
You ain't that fucking hard.
I ain't getting that shit.

1881
02:45:58,949 --> 02:46:01,534
Abernathy, don't get on
my nerves right now.

1882
02:46:01,618 --> 02:46:02,785
I got shit on my mind.

1883
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:06,539
Ooh! You know, I ain't six.

1884
02:46:19,928 --> 02:46:21,888
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

1885
02:46:21,972 --> 02:46:23,431
No.

1886
02:46:24,683 --> 02:46:27,393
Hey, Abernathy.
Check this out.

1887
02:46:39,281 --> 02:46:40,948
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1888
02:46:50,292 --> 02:46:51,751
What does that mean?

1889
02:46:53,962 --> 02:46:55,546
Whoa!

1890
02:47:00,177 --> 02:47:02,720
Faster, you black bitch, faster!

1891
02:47:10,938 --> 02:47:13,022
That fast enough for your bony ass?

1892
02:47:13,106 --> 02:47:14,774
Woo-hoo!

1893
02:47:15,317 --> 02:47:18,236
Whoa!

1894
02:47:20,906 --> 02:47:23,449
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

1895
02:47:31,250 --> 02:47:32,834
All righty.

1896
02:47:32,918 --> 02:47:35,753
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1897
02:47:49,101 --> 02:47:51,769
Check it out bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

1898
02:48:00,028 --> 02:48:02,947
Riot In Thunder Alley]

1899
02:49:07,304 --> 02:49:10,973
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuck? Shit!

1900
02:49:13,602 --> 02:49:15,728
Zoë!!

1901
02:49:17,022 --> 02:49:18,022
Damn it!

1902
02:49:26,990 --> 02:49:29,367
Now!

1903
02:49:29,451 --> 02:49:34,038
- Did you do something to him?
- Nothing! Nothing! Shit!

1904
02:49:34,122 --> 02:49:37,083
- Shit! Here he comes!
- Zoë! Fuck!

1905
02:49:39,336 --> 02:49:40,586
- Shit!
- Shit! Oh, shit!

1906
02:49:42,965 --> 02:49:45,341
- Hold on, Zoë!
- Whoa!

1907
02:49:45,425 --> 02:49:47,927
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Zoë!

1908
02:49:53,183 --> 02:49:55,643
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Zoë!

1909
02:49:55,727 --> 02:49:57,937
- Whoa!

1910
02:50:02,234 --> 02:50:04,318
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you!

1911
02:50:05,153 --> 02:50:07,571
Zoë! Zoë!

1912
02:50:08,490 --> 02:50:11,951
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch.
- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on.

1913
02:50:12,035 --> 02:50:14,161
Whoa! Get away!

1914
02:50:16,498 --> 02:50:19,166
Oh, shit! I can't fucking see!
I can't see!

1915
02:50:19,251 --> 02:50:21,210
Zoë, move your legs!

1916
02:50:23,630 --> 02:50:25,047
Fuck you!

1917
02:50:25,257 --> 02:50:27,341
Come on, come on!

1918
02:50:30,053 --> 02:50:31,887
Redneck lunatic bastard!

1919
02:50:31,972 --> 02:50:33,347
Get away from me!

1920
02:50:33,432 --> 02:50:35,891
- Watch your fucking legs!
- Baby, just hold on.

1921
02:50:35,976 --> 02:50:37,810

Fucking get away from me!

1925

Oh, shit! I'm scared Kim,

1926
02:50:54,244 --> 02:50:55,703
I know, baby, just hold on.

1927
02:50:56,496 --> 02:50:57,621
Watch your feet!

1928
02:50:59,875 --> 02:51:03,085
- You wanna get hot? You wanna get hot?
- You fucking son of a bitch.

1929
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:09,050
- Suck on this for a while, bitch!
- Motherfucker!

1930
02:51:09,801 --> 02:51:11,260
Zoë!!

02:51:11,344 --> 02:51:13,012
Goddamn it!

1932
02:51:37,454 --> 02:51:39,121
- He's coming up!!
- Oh, my God.

1933
02:51:39,206 --> 02:51:40,998
Get away from us, you cocksucker!

1934
02:51:41,083 --> 02:51:42,541
Leave us alone!

1935
02:51:42,626 --> 02:51:45,920
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Put your foot down!

1936
02:51:50,217 --> 02:51:53,302
Zoë! Zoë!

1937
02:51:53,386 --> 02:51:56,055
- Hold on!

1938
02:52:18,161 --> 02:52:19,453
Zoë! Zoë!

1939
02:52:28,213 --> 02:52:29,755
Look out!

1940
02:52:57,325 --> 02:52:59,952
Get ready to fly, bitch!

1941
02:53:03,915 --> 02:53:05,541
- Zoë!
- Zoë! Hold on!

1942
02:53:12,674 --> 02:53:15,342
He's right on your ass!
He's right on your fucking ass!

1943
02:53:30,025 --> 02:53:32,693
Hey!

1944
02:53:32,777 --> 02:53:36,697
Hey! Ladies, that was fun!

1945
02:53:40,994 --> 02:53:43,454
Well, adios!

1946
02:53:43,538 --> 02:53:45,873
- Ow, fuck!

1947
02:53:47,250 --> 02:53:50,377
Shit! Fuck!

1948
02:53:51,546 --> 02:53:56,258
Run away with your ass!
You better run, motherfucker!

1949
02:54:02,557 --> 02:54:03,891
Bitch!

1950
02:54:19,324 --> 02:54:20,407
I'm OK!

1951
02:54:20,492 --> 02:54:23,786
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!

1952
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:26,497
Oh, you fucking bitch!

1953
02:54:26,581 --> 02:54:30,167
Of course you are. Of course you are.
What was I thinking?

1954
02:54:31,878 --> 02:54:34,380
What was I thinking?
Zoë, the fucking cat!

1955
02:54:38,593 --> 02:54:40,427
Whew! That was a close one.

1956
02:54:44,557 --> 02:54:46,725
You guys look like shit.

1957
02:54:46,810 --> 02:54:47,851
Who died?

1958
02:54:49,312 --> 02:54:51,939
That's it!

1959
02:54:52,774 --> 02:54:54,817
Zoë, are you OK?

1960
02:54:55,610 --> 02:54:57,820
Well, I'm gonna have
a hell of a bruise on my bum,

1961
02:54:57,904 --> 02:55:00,531
but aside from that, I'll be sweet.

1962
02:55:03,910 --> 02:55:06,662
So, where's the maniac?

1963
02:55:07,289 --> 02:55:10,082
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.

1964
02:55:11,626 --> 02:55:15,087
- You wanna go get him?
- Oh, hell yeah!

1965
02:55:15,171 --> 02:55:18,632
Honey, I think you might
want to get out.

1966
02:55:20,176 --> 02:55:24,722
Fuck that shit. Let's kill this bastard.

1967
02:55:27,350 --> 02:55:29,226
OK, get your ass in the back,
let's go.

1968
02:55:31,521 --> 02:55:33,147
Fuck this motherfucker!

1969
02:55:35,233 --> 02:55:36,734
- Wait...
- Where the fuck you going?

1970
02:55:36,818 --> 02:55:38,152
I'll be back.

1971
02:55:46,369 --> 02:55:48,829
Yeah, that'll smart. Sweet, let's go.

1972
02:55:48,913 --> 02:55:52,583
Oh, fuck yeah, bitch. Come on.
Bring that shit.

1973
02:55:55,003 --> 02:55:56,420
Giddy up, girl!

1974
02:56:04,304 --> 02:56:06,263
Yeah!

1975
02:56:49,682 --> 02:56:53,352
Come on!

1976
02:57:01,986 --> 02:57:05,030
Oh, why? Oh, no!

1977
02:57:11,121 --> 02:57:14,456
Oh, do it! Do it!

1978
02:57:15,166 --> 02:57:16,667
Do it!

1979
02:57:22,048 --> 02:57:24,758
Oh, no!

1980
02:57:25,051 --> 02:57:28,679
No, no, no! No! God...

1981
02:57:29,556 --> 02:57:32,349
All right. Get it together.

1982
02:57:32,434 --> 02:57:36,603
Get, get... What are you...
What are you... What are you gonna do?

1983
02:57:43,278 --> 02:57:46,196
Kick his ass, Zoë!!
Kick his motherfucking ass!

1984
02:57:46,281 --> 02:57:48,949
- Hey! Now I wanna play!
- Go away!

1985
02:57:49,033 --> 02:57:51,326
- Fucking fuck you!

1986
02:57:51,411 --> 02:57:53,537
Where do you think you're
fucking going?

1987
02:57:58,251 --> 02:57:59,793
Come here, you...!

1988
02:58:06,676 --> 02:58:08,051
