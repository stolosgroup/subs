<i>All I was doing</i>
<i>is what I was trained to do.</i>

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,104
<i>That's how I think of it, so…</i>

5
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,523
<i>You realize</i>
<i>how weak and fragile you are.</i>

6
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,359
<i>This was his first day</i>
<i>going to that office.</i>

7
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,820
- <i>We had his picture posted.</i>
<i>- </i><i>He was happy.</i>

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,363
<i>I have pulmonary fibrosis…</i>

9
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,533
<i>When I saw the building</i>
<i>come down, I just prayed, you know.</i>

10
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,494
<i> I don't know</i>
<i>if we were just in denial.</i>

11
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,163
<i>- Thought he'd end up in the trash.</i>
<i>- They're done digging.</i>

12
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,500
- <i>Don't know how it could get easy.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Have to come to terms with it.</i>

13
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,211
- <i> The rest of them, all gone.</i>
<i>-  I lost a son.</i>

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,548
You want other information?

15
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,096
I'll say this.

16
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,264
I'm angry.

17
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,309
I'm angry with God,

18
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,688
I'm angry with our country, also,
because they let this happen.

19
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,654
My beautiful boy…

20
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,075
…was burned alive

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,327
because of them.

22
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,833
We don't… We don't even have a body.

23
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,631
If someone took your child…

24
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,551
and blew them up…

25
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,433
He didn't even have a fingernail.

26
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,110
How do you go on from there?

27
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,115
How do you calculate that?

28
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,875
<i>What is life worth?</i>

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,128
Not a trick question, people.

30
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,090
Who's gonna give us a number? Uh…

31
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,887
Back row. Uh, you there, Mr. Barron.

32
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,265
Big boy voice here, counselor.
Tell us, where are you from?

33
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,225
I was raised in Wichita.

34
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,685
Kansas. Farm boy.

35
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,563
Good, good, good.
You were raised on one, a farm?

36
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,149
My girlfriend's father owned one.
He grew sorghum.

37
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,066
Sorghum.

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,527
Girlfriend's father grew sorghum.

39
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,654
Miss Paula Tano.

40
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:21,409
Miss Paula Tano, you are now
Mr. Barron's girlfriend's father.

41
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,829
Don't laugh, people, it's very sad.

42
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:29,584
Mr. Barron just died,
tragically crushed by a combine harvester

43
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,545
in Miss Paula Tano's sorghum field.

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,549
Mr. Dickerson,
you're now representing Mr. Barron.

45
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,967
And where's Miss Chen?

46
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,055
Miss Chen, you're representing
Amalgamated Caterpillar,

47
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,266
manufacturer of said combine harvester,

48
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,186
which took poor young Mr. Barron's life,

49
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,355
in the Kansas state civil action

50
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:55,652
of <i>Mr. Barron v. Mr. Barron's</i>
<i>girlfriend's father's sorghum farm</i>

51
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,153
<i>and the Caterpillar company.</i>

52
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,282
So, Miss Chen, how much do you offer
Mr. Dickerson to settle this?

53
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,789
All right, let me rephrase.

54
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:13,795
How much is Mr. Barron's life worth?

55
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,046
Give us a number.

56
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,507
Two million?

57
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,093
Hey, I'm in law school.

58
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,095
I could be earning that before I'm 30.

59
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,141
If you aced the final, maybe,
and if you weren't dead, but you are.

60
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:32,272
This is now Mr. Dickerson's decision,
along with Mr… Your name?

61
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,606
- Patel.
- Patel.

62
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,652
Mr. Patel is the poor bereaved mother
of Mr. Barron.

63
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,781
Three million?

64
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,533
Two-point-seven.

65
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,285
Deal.

66
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,788
There you have it. There's the deal.

67
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,918
To be clear, you haven't stumbled
into a philosophy course.

68
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,797
Where the law is concerned,
this question actually has an answer.

69
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,882
And the answer is a number,

70
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,468
and that's the job.

71
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,114
No. Yes, 55 per victim.

72
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,117
Yeah, and both sides agreed to walk.
That's right.

73
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,954
No one thinks it's fair,
but fair is not the goal here.

74
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,123
It's finish and move on.

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,459
Yeah. Well, thank you, Senator.

76
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,961
Mr. Feinberg, you have a message
from Judge Clinton.

77
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,879
Thank you, Vic.

78
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,716
Just remember me when POTUS calls
about a vacancy on the Supreme Court.

79
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,302
I saw Rehnquist the other day.
He's looking pale.

80
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,387
I said he's looking pale.

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,765
He... Hello?

82
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,475
I think I lost him.

83
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,560
- Probably a good thing.
- It was a joke.

84
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:55,271
Usually the funny ones,
you don't have to announce that after.

85
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,899
I just saved the taxpayers
a year's worth of courtroom.

86
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,400
Do you think he really hung up?

87
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,235
I'm sure he's off
commissioning a monument.

88
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,196
- I have a forum to run.
- No way.

89
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,199
Mr. Darryl Barnes, Esq.
I have an important question for you.

90
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,493
- Is this birthday cake?
- Margo in Accounting.

91
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,660
Mmm.

92
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,913
- Is that the important question?
- No.

93
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,623
Did she save any for you?

94
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,917
Gloria, where are we on that email?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,877
"And so I would ask…"

96
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,962
And so I would <i>insist…</i>

97
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,340
Not "ask," "insist."

98
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,258
…that you be on time.

99
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,261
I have a very busy schedule that day,

100
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,348
so punctuality will be imperative.

101
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,019
Please promptly advise.

102
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,938
"Love, Dad"?

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,191
Huh? Yeah, yeah. Love, Dad.

104
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,693
- Okay. I'll type this up right now.
- Thank you.

105
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,219
Remind me why we're building this

106
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,930
instead of buying that cute little place
on Cape Charles?

107
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,099
- Fog.
- You could still commute.

108
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,810
The numbers show Cape Charles
is more than twice as likely

109
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,395
to be fogged in on any given day.

110
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,857
- That's not a real statistic.
- Two-point-two is the statistic.

111
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,233
If you wanna retire to that.

112
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:26,362
Well, I have heard that people that base
their future happiness on weather data

113
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,198
are 100% less likely to be fun.

114
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,034
Why does he only just looks at me?
Do you mind?

115
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,911
You're not retiring anyway.

116
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,046
Good night, Kenny.

117
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,037
Because they want to put in
another shoe store.

118
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,248
We need another one of those.

119
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,876
They wanna take out
those beautiful arched windows.

120
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,131
You know, the ones that have
the Corinthian carved cartouche-y things.

121
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,008
They wanna take them out
and put in modern ones

122
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,219
so they can hawk more sneakers. It's just…

123
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,096
Not on your watch.

124
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,890
No. No. Now you're mocking me.

125
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,810
There's chicken piccata
in the fridge.

126
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,062
I'm going to post this. Just wait.

127
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,981
Power to the people.

128
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,857
Yep.

129
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,799
Yeah, you can take it first.

130
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,968
- Who's that?
- You can take it apart.

131
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,678
- Hey, love.
- Morning.

132
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,096
You can snap that back in,

133
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,266
take it apart and…
A shorter wing span. Just putting...

134
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,727
All right, come eat, please.
Breakfast is ready.

135
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,022
- Quickly.
- Yay, breakfast!

136
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,815
- Thank you.
- Owen, slow down.

137
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,899
Oh, this way.

138
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,444
Gotta go. Love ya.

139
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,447
And here's, uh,
exactly the one that I got.

140
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,035
- What are we doing after school?
- All right.

141
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,037
Mom!

142
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,102
I can't see anything.

143
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,566
Right now, I don't see anything.

144
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,860
Are you sure?

145
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,703
…freaking out, hold on.

146
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,621
Yeah.

147
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,793
Yeah, how you doing?
What's going on?

148
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,046
- Excuse me, sir, is there any...
- Can't talk.

149
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,547
Excuse me?

150
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,676
- What's happening?
- Did you find her somewhere?

151
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,226
Turn on the TV.

152
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,314
Oh my God.

153
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,234
Yes, we see it.

154
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,408
{\an8}<i>The shock from the attacks</i>

00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,504
<i>confirm the crash of a large plane
north of that airport.</i>

160
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,923
<i> The army has been placed</i>
<i>at Prescott, Delta.</i>

161
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,800
<i>Firefighters</i>
<i>and police officers</i>

162
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,427
<i>are frantically trying to help</i>

163
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,555
<i>those people who have been hurt,
who perhaps have not been rescued.</i>

164
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,306
<i>With tragedy so great,</i>

165
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,936
<i>tonight, a city comes together
searching for safety and comfort.</i>

166
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,106
<i> …of a hundred waiting</i>
<i>for their turn</i>

167
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,442
<i>to go into the World Trade Center area.</i>

168
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,862
<i>…the days to come,
to the rescue those who may be alive.</i>

169
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,281
<i>So we have, at this point,</i>

170
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,784
<i>well over a thousand people
confirmed dead.</i>

171
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,745
<i>The 300 that are missing
that he talked about,</i>

172
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,455
<i>the 800 at the Pentagon,</i>

173
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:31,709
<i>266 who were on those airplanes today,
passengers and crew.</i>

174
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:35,254
<i>Uh, we're now up to about 1300,</i>

175
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,423
<i>and it is expected to go much higher.</i>

176
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,051
<i>Twenty-four hundred people altogether
were killed in Pearl Harbor.</i>

177
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,012
<i>They were military personnel
for the most part.</i>

178
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,765
<i>It was a military attack
on military installations.</i>

179
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,766
<i>We know who did it.</i>

180
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:50,644
<i>This is a different kind of a war
in a new century.</i>

181
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,541
<i>…that involves so many people?</i>

182
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,462
<i>Well, I think all of that</i>
<i>is going to have to be sifted out.</i>

183
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,090
<i>I think that in the midst
of our outrage and anger,</i>

184
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,426
<i>uh, President Bush is right,</i>

185
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>we have to show the world
how we respond to this</i>

186
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,060
<i>uh, both with determination, uh…</i>

187
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,230
- So, what did you tell Kennedy?
<i>- </i>That I'd think about it<i>.</i>

188
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,316
That you're my partner,
and I'd have to talk to you.

189
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,068
Hah. Hmm.

190
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,569
I mean, I know why he asked us.

191
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,947
We're one of five or six firms
with this kind of experience.

192
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,365
If that. If that.

193
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,617
- Yeah. Asbestos, Agent Orange.
- Yeah.

194
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,744
Those were hot-button cases too.

195
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,748
Yeah. I'll let you know
how the committee hearing goes.

196
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,542
Yeah.

197
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,064
Thanks for coming.

198
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,275
{\an8}-I know Teddy appreciates it.
- Sure.

199
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,694
{\an8}We want our best trial lawyers.

200
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,946
{\an8}We'll be needing your support
on this thing.

201
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,533
- Yeah.
- Your people okay?

202
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,076
- Kids, family?
- Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,328
Mike was at his dorm at NYU.
He's all right.

204
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,998
He was shaken up, but, uh… What thing?

205
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,541
A new bill on the floor.

206
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:39,336
The Air Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act.

207
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,882
- Wait, they're bailing out the airlines?
- More like the whole economy.

208
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,344
If the victims of these attacks
or their families

209
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,056
attempt to sue the airline industry
for damages, we will go bankrupt.

210
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,977
And never mind whether they win or not,
the legal costs alone…

211
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,647
And that's when we might as well
just hand those terrorists the victory,

212
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,441
because we're paralyzed.

213
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,735
Deliveries, commuter travel.

214
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,778
The whole economy grinding to a halt.

215
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,865
What we're facing is a national emergency.

216
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:09,199
- Mm-hmm.
- Lee?

217
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,242
Ken?

218
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,995
- Help us come up with another way.
- Right.

219
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,998
Ah, brass tacks here.

220
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,959
You're trying to prevent
lawsuits from the victims.

221
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,337
- That's what they're saying.
- That's not what we're saying.

222
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,713
It's called due process.

223
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,883
Limit. We're saying limit civil suits
against the airlines.

224
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:30,220
Denying recourse to the people
most impacted by these attacks.

225
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,597
Stop grandstanding.

226
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,433
What we're proposing
is a treasury fund

227
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,519
offering tort-style compensation
to the victims.

228
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,397
For their economic losses,
something for pain and suffering.

229
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,442
Yes, but coming from us, Congress,
not the courts.

230
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,779
And in exchange,
the claimants promise not to sue.

231
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,906
- Corporate bailout.
- Chrissakes, Lee.

232
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,033
What, you're calling it charity?

233
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,619
Yes. Government-sponsored charity.

234
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,496
With strings attached?

235
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,248
Ken, help me out here.

236
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,709
A lawsuit could take decades.

237
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
Yes.

238
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,296
After it crashes the economy.

239
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,966
And the victims might still lose.

240
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,094
This is for their own good,
and the nation's.

241
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,141
Yeah. How many, uh…

242
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,477
How many victims are there?

243
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,399
Well, we don't really know yet.

244
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:30,030
A special master we select
will have to negotiate all settlements.

245
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,865
A flat fee would
be another option.

246
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,159
The same dollar value
for every loss of life.

247
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,706
But those towers had CEOs and janitors.

248
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,333
They won't all say yes to the same number.

249
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,210
And even if they did,

250
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,463
anybody wanna go on record
with what that number is?

251
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,845
Yeah, well, pretty soon somebody's
gonna have to do the vulgar work

252
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,722
of putting numbers on a check.

253
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,899
So you're saying, what,
you wanna do this job?

254
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,444
Well, no, I mean…

255
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,906
Well, I mean,
we're discussing it right now, so…

256
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,245
Look, you're telling me
you're not sick about it,

257
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,830
watching all this on TV?

258
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,625
- Of course I'm sick about it.
- Well…

259
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:28,088
Well, it's just tough stuff, Kenny.

260
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,382
I know, I know. It is very tough, yeah.

261
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,926
And you're not exactly…

262
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,844
What?

263
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,473
You're not a rabbi or a priest,
you're a lawyer.

264
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,434
I know. And that's exactly
what these people need right now.

265
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,063
There's a process here, you know.
I hire a team,

266
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,066
I draft an objective formula,

267
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,526
and I dispense reasonable payments.

268
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,569
Just like that?

269
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,156
Yeah, it's no different
than my previous cases in that regard.

270
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,659
Look, this is something I'm good at.

271
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,745
This is something…

272
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,874
This is something I can do to help.

273
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:19,056
Judge Weinstein told me
how you reached a settlement on DES.

274
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,934
Ten years of courthouse war.

275
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,394
You brought both sides to a motel room,

276
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,355
told them they could stay
as long as they wanted,

277
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,066
but they couldn't leave
until they reached a settlement.

278
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,901
- Is that really true?
- It is.

279
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,612
I did let them order room service.

280
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,073
You know, Attorney General, I…

281
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,700
People are rational animals.

282
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,370
I find if you…
if you force them to the table,

283
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,164
most behave in a way
that makes the most sense.

284
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,376
It's hard to believe
you live in Washington.

285
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,879
Well, in politics, uh, conflict sells.

286
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,715
I find that what works best is compromise.

287
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,135
No one walks away too happy,

288
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,053
just happy enough to walk away.

289
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,974
And when you walk away today,
what outcome makes you happy enough?

290
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,893
I'd like to have the job, John.

291
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,437
No one wants this job.

292
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,359
Well, that narrows down
your options.

293
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,613
I suppose it does.

294
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,908
Except that you're a Democrat,

295
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,829
Teddy's former chief of staff.
Did you hope I'd overlook that?

296
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,832
Well, I was hoping
you could see that as a good thing.

297
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,376
I mean, you said yourself,
this is a hot potato.

298
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,795
You know if you give it to an insider,

299
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,174
you know, a party man
or friend of the president, then…

300
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,467
- They'll blame us if it fails.
- Right.

301
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,638
Pick me, it's the opposition's fault.

302
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,600
Unless for some reason, you know,

303
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,102
by some miracle, I pull this off,
in which case…

304
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,520
Don't we look open-minded,

305
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,106
reaching all the way
across the aisle to find you.

306
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,861
It is felt, and I'm speaking
for the White House here,

307
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,823
that for the program
to succeed in staving off

308
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,868
a full-on economic cataclysm,

309
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,956
no fewer than 80%
of eligible claimants must opt in.

310
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,835
That means voluntarily choose not to sue.

311
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,630
Uh, that shouldn't be a problem.

312
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,717
Well, congratulations, Special Master.

313
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,429
- You got any more surprises for me?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,765
I'd like to work for free.

315
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,186
Uh, hey, everyone come in here for just a…

316
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,731
Uh, Camille and I want to thank you

317
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,526
for shouldering the firm's
day-to-day responsibilities

318
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,405
while we devote our time to this pro bono.

319
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:44,910
Uh, it's not gonna be easy,
and we sure welcome all of your help.

320
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,664
But if we do our job
the way I know we can,

321
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,417
well, we just might make a difference.

322
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,963
So thank you. And, uh… Thank you.

323
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,843
Thanks again.

324
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,936
This is you psyching yourself up,
or considering a quick escape?

325
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,856
When's the last time
I took on something I couldn't handle?

326
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,318
Well, Brockton track meet, 1961.

327
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,403
I came in second.

328
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,363
And you still remember who beat you.

329
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,447
Phil Leonardo.

330
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,324
And I was robbed, by the way.

331
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,578
You don't know how to lose, Kenny.

332
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,873
Yeah, well, this one's, you know,

333
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,584
not that kind of case.

334
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,170
There is no winning.

335
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,839
That's what I'm afraid of.

336
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,383
Ken. Call for you.

337
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,343
It's the president.

338
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,223
Wanna take it here?

339
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,558
- Yeah.
- Line one.

340
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,104
Yeah, this is Ken Feinberg.

341
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,981
<i>Please hold for the president.</i>

342
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,233
Well… Hello, Mr. President.

343
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,320
- <i>Ken? Is this Ken Feinberg?</i>
- Yeah.

344
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,572
<i>Ken, I wanna</i>
<i>congratulate you on this thing.</i>

345
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,824
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, Ashcroft was impressed.</i>
- Well...

346
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,618
<i>Listen, you're taking</i>
<i>the heat on this, okay?</i>

347
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,747
<i>Now, I would not wish this job
on my worst enemy.</i>

348
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,041
<i>They tell me you're type of guy
that takes no prisoners.</i>

349
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,751
Well...

350
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,211
<i> I'm kidding you, counselor.</i>
<i>I like to josh.</i>

351
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,838
<i>- Did I scare you off?</i>
- No, sir.

352
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,215
No, no, sir. I'm still here.

353
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,925
<i>No, there you are. Okay, good.</i>

354
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:27,012
Well, thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much.

355
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,097
And, look, you won't regret this.

356
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,724
<i>Sure hope not.</i>

357
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,518
Okay.

358
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,435
- Morning.
- Good morning.

359
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,771
Ah, I assume you've all met,
but this is Priya Khundi.

360
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,525
Priya graduated first
in my class last year, Georgetown.

361
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,903
And after she passed the bar,
I offered her a place here,

362
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,115
but she, very politely, turned me down

363
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,076
for a big, fancy company
down on Wall Street.

364
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,414
Their main office
was on the 98th floor of the North Tower.

365
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,792
- Ah.
- So we're very lucky to have her.

366
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,920
Do you all have copies of the statute?

367
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,922
H.R.2926,

368
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,634
the Airline Transportation
Safety and System Stabilization Act.

369
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,137
Okay, who's read it? Great.

370
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,972
- Did it take you long?
- Not really.

371
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,266
- You wanna know why?
- Because it's short?

372
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,187
Uh, yeah, that
and there's no law in this law.

373
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,732
What it says is the victims
and their families will be compensated

374
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,776
based on economic value lost.

375
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,031
What that means,
they left up to the special master. Us.

376
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,241
It's up to us to write the rules.

377
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,202
Ken and I have done it in other cases

378
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,871
and it is always messy,
so get ready for it.

379
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,917
Like, who's eligible?
Who gets how much? Where we draw the line?

380
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,710
Where do we start?

381
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,300
Eighty percent, Priya.

382
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,052
That's our target from the DOJ.

383
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,346
If we don't hit that number,
the plan won't work.

384
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,056
Any fewer claimants come aboard,

385
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,184
the lawsuits that result
could crater the economy.

386
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,520
- So we're told.
- No pressure, people.

387
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:25,649
For every claimant,
we'll need to calculate a dollar value

388
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,985
for the human loss,
whether it's loss of limb or loss of life.

389
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,489
Most of the people who died that day
were providers for their families.

390
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,366
We can't bring them back,

391
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,910
but we can help their loved ones
pay their bills.

392
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,286
Now you people understand

393
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,249
we're not gonna be able to haggle
every case subjectively.

394
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,376
That's where the math comes in.

395
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,087
So we're, uh, we're gonna need a rubric.

396
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,673
These are the latest
actuarial tables

397
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,592
from the top casualty
in life insurance companies.

398
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,262
We'll use these numbers as a basis.

399
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,305
Here, you guys study up on these

400
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,808
and help Camille come up with a proposal.

401
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:05,063
Okay, so West Street, South Ferry,

402
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,232
Lower Broadway,

403
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,985
and Canal Street.

404
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,611
Okay, here's one.

405
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:15,240
What if there are multiple dependents?
How do we decide who gets the money?

406
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,950
Where there's a will, we follow it.

407
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,619
- And where there isn't one?
- We follow the state law.

408
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,038
The state they died in,
or the state they came from?

409
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:25,208
- The state of residence.
- What about domestic partners?

410
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,543
What do we do about them?

411
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,714
Let's talk about the deadline.

412
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,426
The statute gives us two years
and a month from today.

413
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,637
That's December 22nd, 2003.

414
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,014
That feels short.

415
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,350
- Well, not for families in grief.
- We could file for an extension.

416
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,769
Ah-ah-ah. Don't you dare. No, no, no.

417
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,773
If we extend it, they'll hem
and they'll haw, and they won't act.

418
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,026
Deadline is our friend here.

419
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,406
Okay, what are we forgetting?

420
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,450
Their names.

421
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,578
So far, we have a dozen lists,
but nothing comprehensive.

422
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,790
The flight manifests and the Pentagon,
those are the easy ones.

423
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,460
NYPD and FDNY, they have lists.

424
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,130
The big companies like Cantor Fitzgerald,
they're putting some lists together,

425
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,967
but as for the records
of who passed through the doors that day…

426
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,135
They're all gone.

427
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,554
We don't even know
how many names we're looking for.

428
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,146
Relax.
We've done this kind of thing before.

429
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,691
No, this one is raw.
Those aren't lawyers out there.

430
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,443
Good, I can't stand lawyers.

431
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,279
What are you, running for office?

432
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,615
Come on, be a person, not a politician.

433
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,741
Mmm.

434
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,619
Thank you.

435
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,330
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thank you.

436
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,847
Good afternoon.

437
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,015
Uh, thank you for coming.

438
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,601
Uh, as you may know,
I am Kenneth Feinberg.

439
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,311
I am the special master

440
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:01,109
of the September 11th
Victim Compensation Fund.

441
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,446
Um, I would like today to tell you...

442
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:13,746
Um, I'd… I'd like to tell you
how the 9/11 fund will work.

443
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,126
You've all been given copies of this,
the presumptive claims formula.

444
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,043
Yes.

445
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,254
Um, and quite soon,

446
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:25,842
we'll be sending this along to Congress
for a comment period.

447
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,343
What?

448
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:30,471
Upon approval,
there will be no further changes.

449
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,515
- Mr. Feinberg?
- I got a question.

450
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,183
- I'm sorry.
- I got a question.

451
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,270
If you could hold your questions
till after my remarks.

452
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:42,692
Now, I'd ask you to refer to the table
at the top of page two.

453
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:50,116
So as you can see, the formula
is actually fairly streamlined.

454
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,367
Why do we need one?

455
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,370
- Please just hold your question.
- Why do we need a formula?

456
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,580
Yeah.

457
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,665
Why isn't it equal payment
for everybody?

458
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,833
Yeah!

459
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,253
My daughter's life was worth just as much
as anybody in a corner office.

460
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,507
Unfortunately, that aspect of the law
has been out of our control.

461
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,843
My boy was a firefighter.

462
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,096
Was he… Was he worth less

463
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,809
than the… than the guy pushing pencils
and trading stock?

464
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,478
No.

465
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,858
Certainly not… not as a human being, no.

466
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,860
Their… Their lives ended the same way.

467
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,820
But their mortgages did differ.

468
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,030
How dare you!

469
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,866
He's just trying to shut us up
so we don't sue.

470
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,910
- Hi.
- Hi.

471
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,788
- Have they… Has it started already?
- They're just starting.

472
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,082
- Good, okay.
- Would you like a claims form?

473
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,001
Uh, no, I have my own.
I printed it off the web.

474
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,171
And there's a typo on page three
that you should know about.

475
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,006
- And also, there are…
- Okay.

476
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,926
- I should sign in here, right?
- Yes, please do.

477
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,890
There… And there are more issues
that need to be addressed.

478
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,476
They're substantive, okay.
And they need to be addressed.

479
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,477
Okay.

480
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,484
I mean…
Look, as a legal professional,

481
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,153
I know chasing a lawsuit is a big mistake.

482
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,989
- Did you lose anybody?
- Look...

483
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,325
- Did you lose anybody in your family?
- I just… Let me explain.

484
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:20,164
Congress mandated
that I calculate the economic value.

485
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,208
Economical.

486
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,418
Please.

487
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,253
You're just afraid of being sued.

488
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,088
I understand how it is.

489
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,257
- Understand?
- Look, please.

490
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,719
- What I mean is, I sympathize.
- Who did you lose?

491
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,013
Listen, as a legal professional,
I will tell you,

492
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,973
it will be years in court.

493
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,975
You might win, you might not.

494
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,020
This is fast money and it's tax-free.

495
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,147
Put your thinking caps on.

496
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,149
This is the only game in town.

497
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,568
- How dare you!
- You think this is a game?

498
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,862
- I'm sorry.
- This isn't a game!

499
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,740
- What do you know about law?
- Who do you think you are?

500
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,284
We lost brothers.
Now they sent some Jew lawyer…

501
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,707
I wish… I wish we could spit on your grave
the way you spit on ours.

502
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,959
- Please.
- Wait, everyone. Wait, wait.

503
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,629
This man, he did not cause our situation.

504
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:14,218
He's here to tell us how the government
intends to deal with it.

505
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,430
And I for one
would just like to hear him out.

506
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,640
Thank you.

507
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,725
Thank you.

508
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,102
Thank you. And I… I was…

509
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:27,065
Uh, look, as I was…

510
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,568
This meeting is only…

511
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,738
It's purely introductory, that's it.

512
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,366
Any questions you have
that aren't answered in the pamphlet,

513
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,037
well, I will make my staff available
for private hearings

514
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:46,250
every business day
between now and the filing deadline.

515
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,925
What do you think?

516
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,844
Maybe a poor choice of words
here and there.

517
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,304
Here and there?

518
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,765
- Camille?
- Yeah.

519
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,309
- We need to get back to the office.
- Mr. Feinberg?

520
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,145
- Mr. Feinberg, give me a minute, please?
- Yeah?

521
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,273
I'm Frank Donato. I'm sorry to bother you.

522
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,733
No, not at all. Not at all.

523
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,318
Hi, Ken Feinberg.

524
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,821
What happened there? Did you break that?

525
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,614
My son, Andy, broke his last year.

526
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:17,698
Rugby injury.

527
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,785
South Tower.

528
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,247
Yeah, I'm just curious
about this number.

529
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,206
Sure.

530
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,459
Jeez. Thank you for… for your courage.

531
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,046
My brother, too, Nick. Nicholas.
Same line of company.

532
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,090
Ah. Is he here?

533
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,095
Well…

534
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,139
Gosh, I'm sorry.

535
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,143
Yeah. I, uh, I lost track of him
after the first one fell,

536
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,687
and the captain says
he went back in to help.

537
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,313
Well, that…

538
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,440
That takes a hero.

539
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,651
Yeah. Except there wasn't any use.

540
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,697
I mean, the engineers, they knew
the second one was coming down.

541
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,701
They told PD to call out evacs,
but our radios, they're garbage.

542
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,497
They hardly work in high-rise buildings,
if you believe that, in New York City.

543
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,375
Look, we've been filing
the same damn reports for years,

544
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,752
and you can guess
where they tell us to shove 'em.

545
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,672
That's why things went so sideways
like they did, negligence,

546
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,215
top-down, cheap, fucking…

547
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,303
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

548
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,891
When you file your report, whatever it is
that you do at the end of this,

549
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,852
I want Nicky's story in it,
to make sure they change things,

550
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,730
so that it don't ever happen
this way again. Can you do that?

551
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,565
- Well...
- Can you promise me?

552
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,568
- We can certainly look into...
- Not just talk.

553
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,403
I want it to change.

554
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,197
That's why I'm here.

555
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,157
- Why I'm still here.
- I understand.

556
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,160
- Believe that.
- Can you hold? Camille.

557
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,661
Can you come over here?

558
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,124
- Frank, this is Camille Biros.
- Hi.

559
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,751
She's my deputy administrator.

560
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,712
And if you talk to her,
she can explain the whole process.

561
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,423
No, I don't need to hear anything else.
I just…

562
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,676
I need you to give me your word
on this thing.

563
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,053
Ken.

564
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,180
Then me and my wife,

565
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,558
Nicky's widow, our whole family,
we'll sign up for your fund, no problem.

566
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:12,355
Yeah. Well, we're certainly
going to take a look at it.

567
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,989
Website at the bottom.
First meeting tomorrow.

568
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,575
There you go, folks.
First meeting tomorrow.

569
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,744
- Yeah.
- First meeting. Would you like one?

570
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,041
There you go.
First meeting is tomorrow, if you'd like.

571
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,628
So Fix The Fund. Here you are.
Take a few of these, hand them out.

572
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,255
We need to talk about this.

573
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,006
Yeah, not now though.

574
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,675
Website on the bottom, okay?

575
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,885
- Hello.
- Oh, hi. How are you?

576
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,596
Hey, I wanna thank you
for your help back there.

577
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,056
- Oh.
- I gotta tell you, I was…

578
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,809
Here you are. Website at the bottom.
First meeting is tomorrow.

579
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,478
…a little worried when you stood up.
I'm glad you did.

580
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,439
Oh, well, I believe in civility,
Mr. Feinberg.

581
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,941
- Yeah.
- Charles Wolf.

582
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,901
And you'll be seeing a lot of me.

583
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,528
Oh, good to know. And it's Ken.

584
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,364
I think you'll find
that I'm one of your harshest critics.

585
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,700
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

586
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,493
Well, my wife died that day,

587
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,496
and everything about this formula
offends me.

588
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,580
Oh.

589
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,542
Here you go. Take one of those.
And I'll give you one too.

590
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,711
I've set up a page on the World Wide Web.

591
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,129
Website's there at the bottom.

592
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,965
It's called Fix The Fund.
And here you go. Fix The Fund.

593
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,970
There you go. There's two there.
And, um, if you'd like to visit it

594
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,848
and come to our meeting,
we have the first meeting, uh, tomorrow…

595
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,182
Here you go. Take that please.

596
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,268
And we'd… I'd love it if you would attend.

597
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,686
Also, I have this for you.

598
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,689
This is something…
And there are a number of notes

599
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,734
and corrections and things.
It's important you address those.

600
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,444
Here you are. Take these, folks.

601
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,989
Take a look at the website on the bottom.
There's a couple of them there for you.

602
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,741
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

603
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,950
Fix The Fund.

604
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,287
- We're not gonna rewrite the formula.
- They don't trust us.

605
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,289
They don't understand
this is for their own good.

606
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,584
The airlines would bury them in litigation
until they had nothing left.

607
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,377
You think I don't know that?

608
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,797
This is different.
Didn't you feel it in there?

609
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,133
Our other cases like this,
Agent Orange, Asbestos,

610
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,761
those were settled after years in court.
People had moved on.

611
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,387
These people aren't there yet.

612
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,639
Camille, they're emotional right now.

613
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,184
We need to be objective toward them.
That's all.

614
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,478
Hey, that's for you, Feinberg!

615
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,939
Fuck you!

616
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,650
What the…

617
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,789
{\an8}<i>Families got in last night.</i>

618
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,543
Cleary Gottlieb helped us out
with the immigration status and the INS,

619
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,586
so we'll use their conference room.

620
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,634
Coming?

621
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,690
Sorry, it's just, you know,
small spaces these days, and heights.

622
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,401
I'll be fine. It's…

623
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,243
I know you've been informed,
but I wanna reassure you

624
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,704
that your citizenship
or your immigration status

625
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,082
will have absolutely no effect
on our process here today.

626
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:03,085
Everything you tell us
will be kept strictly confidential.

627
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,037
We're all looking at your tables
and not liking what we're seeing.

628
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,040
You're only factoring in
yearly compensation.

629
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,251
What about commissions, bonuses?
We represent high-worth individuals.

630
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,421
That kind of income comes and goes.
There's no guarantees with that.

631
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,341
- That's why we stick to the salaries.
- That's unacceptable.

632
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,010
You'll also have to strike this rule
deducting life insurance.

633
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,595
This is not a negotiation here...

634
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,431
Why should our clients' families
be penalized for planning well?

635
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,474
Come on.

636
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,185
No one's being penalized.

637
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,353
Thank you, Lee.

638
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,231
We're just being paid off
to keep our clients out of court.

639
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,358
That's an oversimplification.

640
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,568
That's the purpose of the fund, Ken.

641
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,071
I was in the room, too, remember?

642
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,450
I do wanna point out that the law requires

643
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,161
we base awards on income,

644
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,831
but we've decided on a floor payout

645
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:27,044
for all lost lives of $200,000.

646
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,693
Now, mind you, that's just a minimum.

647
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,655
Is that split between more people,
or just the families here?

648
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,409
Uh, no, it's not a split at all.
It's per decedent.

649
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,674
This is a report by an economist,
a distinguished one,

650
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,636
predicting future compensation
growth rates for our clients.

651
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,598
We suggest you use
those numbers as a baseline.

652
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,475
We're here as friends, Ken.

653
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:26,979
Your formula may be enough
for waitresses at Windows on the World,

654
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,481
but our clients expect a little more.

655
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,110
And if they can't get it from the fund,

656
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,363
they'll seek that remuneration elsewhere.

657
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,659
That bad?

658
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,121
Pack of wolves out for blood.

659
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,748
Yours?

660
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:46,790
Grateful.

661
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,889
- Are they all here to meet with the staff?
- Yeah.

662
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,643
Priya and the others are helping out.
I'm meeting with as many as I can myself.

663
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,394
Oh good, good. Very good.

664
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,605
Most would rather meet with you, you know.

665
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,940
They lost loved ones
that are gone forever,

666
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:15,444
and nothing you do will fill that hole.

667
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,114
You'll feel cold and cruel at times

668
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,533
because you can't make them happy, but…

669
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:24,912
…that's the job.

670
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,208
So just try to remember
why you're doing it.

671
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,969
I… I hope this is all right.

672
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,808
The stenographer will be here
just to keep a record of our conversation.

673
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:46,725
Sure.

674
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,770
Is… Why don't you, um…

675
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,315
Why don't you tell me
about your loved one,

676
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:54,900
Ann-Marie?

677
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,446
Uh, Page 14, um, Part 2K

678
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,074
talks about supporting documents
I should enclose,

679
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,535
like financial stuff, so I…

680
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,579
I dug up
all his files here,

681
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,624
what I could find.

682
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,460
Honestly, I don't know where to start.

683
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,587
Let's see if we can make sense of it.

684
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,885
It asks here if she was suffering
from any medical disabilities.

685
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,431
What does that mean? If she was,
you gonna cut the amount of money?

686
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,100
- Well, not necessarily.
- Bullshit you guys are pulling.

687
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,602
This is like going
to an insurance company.

688
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,355
Gotta watch your back
with every thing you say with them,

689
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,815
and it's the same thing here.

690
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,402
My kids need money for the both of us.

691
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,071
They won't have anybody left.

692
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,997
There's no way to cut me a check
before the official deadline?

693
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,751
<i>That morning,</i>
<i>she was scheduled for a different flight,</i>

694
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,086
but another girl called in sick,

695
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,381
and so, it was my sister.

696
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,051
Uh…

697
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,763
And she's the one
who called the tower on the radio.

698
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,683
Air Traffic Control,

699
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,436
they played it for me.

700
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,899
She must have been so scared.

701
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,029
She sounded so calm.

702
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:27,201
So the elevators came,
and everybody piled on,

703
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,580
but there wasn't enough room,
and so Greg said,

704
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:35,000
"That's okay, everyone. You go ahead."

705
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,965
There were two women who weren't ready,
and so he said, "I'll wait with them."

706
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:48,472
And so everyone else got out,
and another elevator never came.

707
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,893
And I know that part of the story

708
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,479
because he called me
when they were trapped there

709
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,483
to say that he loved me

710
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,610
and the children.

711
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,779
He said…

712
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,118
He told me that he was trapped,

713
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,831
and he was having difficulty breathing.

714
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,166
I could hear the women
screaming in the background

715
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,751
that they didn't wanna die.

716
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,591
And just then he heard
an announcement. They were…

717
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,260
I heard it too.

718
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,639
They were announcing on the loudspeakers,
"Please evacuate the building."

719
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,602
And Greg was…

720
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,190
He always had a sense of humor. And he…

721
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,027
While he was talking to me,
he actually started to laugh.

722
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,613
He was joking to me saying that,

723
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,492
"I think I know
I have to get out of the building."

724
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,495
And he was laughing so hard,

725
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,873
until he said, "I have to go now

726
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,961
because I can't talk anymore,
because I'm having trouble with air."

727
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,366
I know
I'm not officially his next of kin.

728
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,537
We never made it to Vermont.

729
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,708
And Tom's parents don't, uh…

730
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,963
Well, they're a pretty traditional
military family.

731
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,634
They pretend I don't exist.

732
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,305
But I'm the one he called,

733
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:55,515
before the end,

734
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,059
not them.

735
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,899
Machine picked up.

736
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,944
I wasn't home.

737
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,491
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

738
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,159
I know the rules.

739
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,246
State law says
we were nothing to each other.

740
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,752
But I'd like you to hear his voice.

741
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,924
<i> Hi, hon.</i>

742
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:31,927
<i>By now I guess you've heard
about the mess in New York.</i>

743
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,595
<i>Um…</i>

744
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,724
<i>Well, a plane just hit here, too,
on the western side of the building.</i>

745
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,852
<i>- It went right through the E and D rings.</i>
- Okay, that's…

746
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,062
Could you turn that off?

747
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,272
<i> I don't know</i>
<i>if they're showing it on the news.</i>

748
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,399
That's enough.

749
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,025
<i>I love you.</i>

750
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,152
That's enough. I don't wanna listen.

751
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,200
He was a civilian contractor
at the Pentagon.

752
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,911
They were gonna have a civil union,
but Tom's parents…

753
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,873
- They won't even take Graham's calls.
- And what did you tell him?

754
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:06,294
I told him that Virginia state law
has no protection for same-sex couples,

755
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,797
and our rules are tied to state law.

756
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,467
Well, that's it then.
I mean, our hands are tied.

757
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:17,139
- We can't insert ourselves in...
- Why can't we make exceptions?

758
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,016
There are others.

759
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,601
Last week, a widow came in with cancer.

760
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,981
She needs more than we can give her
by the rules, and she needs it expedited.

761
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,817
Can't cherry pick one case over another.

762
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,820
We can't write new rules
for every claimant.

763
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,655
I know this is personal to you...

764
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,033
You weren't in those rooms, okay?

765
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,077
- You didn't listen to them.
- We're not therapists.

766
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,415
Am I right? It's not our job.

767
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:45,500
I…

768
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,754
It's not like I don't care.
Of course I care.

769
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,757
How could you not care?
That's why we're here.

770
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,718
But I need to stay impartial
for this to work.

771
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:58,764
We set rules for a reason.
We set deadlines for a reason.

772
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,098
That's the job.

773
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,142
Camille, go on, tell her.

774
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,610
Priya.

775
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,155
Hey.

776
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,491
- Hey.
<i>- </i>You okay?

777
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,159
Yeah, just…

778
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,746
He thinks
I'm taking it too personally.

779
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,581
Come on, that is out of line.

780
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,125
No.

781
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,211
No, he's right, you know.

782
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,005
It is personal for me. I…

783
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,386
If I can't be objective,
then maybe I shouldn't be here.

784
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,060
I just…
I think I just need some air. Yeah.

785
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,269
All right.

786
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,646
- Hey.
- Yeah.

787
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,730
See you tomorrow?

788
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,816
Yeah.

789
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,252
Oh.

790
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,671
Gloria.

791
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,298
Call the restaurant

792
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,678
and see if Dede and the kids
are still eating dinner, would ya, please?

793
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,139
<i>They called an hour ago, Ken.</i>

794
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,723
<i>The kids had trains to catch.</i>

795
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,601
<i>Oh, they said to tell you, though,
that they understand.</i>

796
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,145
Whoa.

797
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:29,855
All right.

798
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,169
I understand that, and I'm sorry,

799
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,171
but our staff already went home.

800
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,757
Come back tomorrow,
I'll make sure that we get you into see…

801
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,218
Is there a problem, Gloria?

802
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,805
Oh, Mr. Donato, right?

803
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,225
Yeah, we… we had an appointment,
but we hit traffic, so we're late.

804
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,186
There's no one here.

805
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,146
The whole staff is gone.

806
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,774
Oh, well, I'll take this one.

807
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,277
- Come on into my office.
- Not me,

808
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,362
them.

809
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:25,702
So, uh…

810
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:30,040
Frank told me about your husband.

811
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:31,958
- Nick.
- Yeah.

812
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,169
Yeah, Frank thinks this is a scam.

813
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,298
That it's, like, blood money
to cover up mistakes.

814
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:41,551
Well, at least, you're open-minded.

815
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:45,847
I just think that the boys might want
their dad's story told in your report,

816
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,641
if that's a thing.

817
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,643
Hmm, sure. Sure.

818
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,190
Are you gonna take notes or somethin'?

819
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,319
Ah, right.

820
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,737
Uh…

821
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:05,909
Actually, our stenographer
already went home for the day.

822
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:06,993
Oh.

823
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:09,955
Can't you type?

824
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,341
Wha... Uh…

825
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,635
Hold on a minute here. There we go.

826
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,886
Uh…

827
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,471
Why don't we…

828
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,766
uh, start with your name?

829
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,935
Okay. Karen Donato.

830
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,437
My husband, Nick…

831
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,441
Nicholas Donato,
was a New York City firefighter.

832
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,112
Ladder 179 out of Staten Island.

833
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,571
Yeah.

834
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,082
Do you…

835
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,959
Tell me more about him.

836
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,506
Do you have like a list of questions
you could ask me maybe?

837
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:08,680
Uh, well, actually I… I don't…
I don't usually do this part myself.

838
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:12,183
Yeah, I just… It's harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

839
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,643
Yeah, I understand.

840
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,021
Uh, well, if you're uncomfortable...

841
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,316
My husband of eight years,
and I can't even think of anything to say.

842
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:25,447
Well, uh, he must have been a good…
a good dad.

843
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:27,866
Yeah.

844
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,743
Oh God, he was a great dad.

845
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,412
He would come home every night after work,

846
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,831
he'd throw the ball with Nicky Jr.,

847
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,000
he would read Patty a book.

848
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:39,419
He didn't even mind
when Tyler made number two.

849
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,505
- He said he liked changing diapers.
- Well, that's a hero.

850
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,218
Yeah.

851
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,475
He was my whole world.

852
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,564
- Can I have a tissue, please?
- Yeah.

853
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,570
Here we go.

854
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:06,654
Thank you.

855
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:12,535
You know, everybody
keeps telling me to move on.

856
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,413
I don't know how to do that.

857
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,460
- I'm never gonna get over him.
- Well, it's still very soon.

858
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,628
No, never.

859
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,590
- I'm really sorry.
- No, no, no.

860
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,425
That's all right. Look, um,

861
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,304
I just want you to know there's
no pressure to sign on to the fund today.

862
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,889
Your status as a single mother...

863
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,974
No, I'm not gonna take any money.

864
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,226
Not now, no, but...

865
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,562
No, there's no money in the world
that's good enough for Nick.

866
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,315
- I didn't mean...
- You know, I had him in my life.

867
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,401
We had so many…

868
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,489
dreams and plans…

869
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,035
…and things we were gonna do.

870
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,498
And then he was just gone.
He was gone.

871
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,253
He didn't even eat breakfast.
He was just gone.

872
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,591
And now you're trying to give me money,

873
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,260
Frank wants me to make a stink,

874
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:13,680
there's lawyers calling me
and telling me to sue everybody,

875
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:16,558
and the phone just won't stop ringing.

876
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,185
But it's never the phone call I want.

877
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,147
It's never the call saying
that they found his body.

878
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,482
That they're gonna bring him home.

879
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,192
And no offense,

880
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,319
I just want you,

881
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,781
I want all of you
to please stop calling me.

882
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,533
Please leave me alone.

883
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,037
I'm sorry.

884
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,374
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

885
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:15,783
Kenny?

886
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,538
I met a widow today.

887
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,625
Three kids.

888
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,294
Can you imagine?

889
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:32,800
No.

890
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,055
I didn't know what to say.

891
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,311
Well, sometimes,
there isn't anything.

892
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,413
<i>That one's blocked.</i>

893
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,832
<i>Anyway, it's hard to see.</i>

894
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,294
<i>I'll… I'll call when I get out.</i>

895
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,964
<i>People are collapsing from the smoke.</i>

896
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,341
<i>Bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Sorry. Sorr...</i>

897
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,471
<i> Hi, hon.</i>

898
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,432
<i>By now I guess you've heard about
the mess in New York.</i>

899
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,434
<i>Um…</i>

900
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:28,439
<i>Well, a plane just hit here, too,
on the western side of the building.</i>

901
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,094
<i>This is not</i>
<i>the preferred option</i>

902
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,722
<i>of the president of the United States,
or any member of this body.</i>

903
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:02,515
<i>This is the last option.</i>

904
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,767
<i>We can make the case</i>

905
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,688
<i>that it is obvious
that Saddam Hussein continues</i>

906
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,982
<i>this buildup of weapons
of mass destruction,</i>

907
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,651
<i>and his desire and effort even in…</i>

908
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,653
<i>Up to and including nuclear weapons.</i>

909
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:19,490
<i>But we are not the ones
who are forcing this issue.</i>

910
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,368
<i>The president and his resolution
did not force the issue.</i>

911
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,288
<i>It is Saddam Hussein
who is forcing this issue.</i>

912
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,331
<i>And we will…</i>

913
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,503
<i>Final stop</i>
<i>on this express train,</i>

914
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,005
<i>New York Penn Station.</i>

915
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,215
<i>Next stop, New York Penn Station.</i>

916
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:07,413
Well, I… I think the most
important thing is that we stand united.

917
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:12,418
Because the only way
that they're going to respond to you

918
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,712
is if they know you're speaking as one.

919
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,881
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Of course.

920
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,304
You came. Thank you.

921
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,139
We start in a few minutes.

922
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,891
An enemy in our midst.

923
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:30,019
- Ah, hi. Priya Khundi.
- Yes, I remember.

924
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:35,274
Did Mr. Feinberg send you here
to spy on us or to listen?

925
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,945
- Actually, he doesn't know I came.
- Ah.

926
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,532
Well, it's easier for him
if we just remain numbers, right?

927
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,741
More manageable?

928
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,619
He's right, it is.

929
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,663
Hmm, I understand. Yeah. Yeah.

930
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:51,416
But you came.

931
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,752
- Yeah, um, I've been following your blog.
- Mm-hmm.

932
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:58,840
Your wife, Katherine,
she had a job at Kyle and MacAllan.

933
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,508
Yes. Yeah.

934
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:04,053
That, um, was her dream job.

935
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,432
Well, it would have been mine too.

936
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,851
I… I was, uh…

937
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,478
I was gonna start that week.

938
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,605
Oh my.

939
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,652
Well, I'm glad that you…

940
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,237
Yeah.

941
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:24,657
So can I ask you then?

942
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:32,457
What would your life be worth
on your boss's spreadsheet?

943
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,336
I'm not married,
so, um, less than Katherine's.

944
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,464
And do you think that's fair?

945
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,592
No.

946
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,885
But your boss does?

947
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,804
He doesn't think fair exists.

948
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:48,890
Do you?

949
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,976
Honestly, I don't know.

950
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,063
But I did come here to listen.

951
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:10,495
This is the latest, huh? This is…

952
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:14,123
You're sure this is the latest?
These totals are accurate?

953
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,875
Technically, we rounded up.

954
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,169
Uh, it's all right, it's okay.

955
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,297
We're 12 months out.
That's an eternity. It's like I say,

956
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,383
people will wait for a deadline.
They're just avoiding it for now.

957
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,804
They're not avoiding it.
They're just avoiding us.

958
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,597
I mean, look at this.

959
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,017
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Fix The Fund. I remember, yeah.

960
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,478
This is my pal.
This is my buddy from the town hall.

961
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:40,149
His web page is receiving more than
twice the visits ours does every day.

962
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,152
He's got a mailing list
of almost 7,000 names.

963
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,612
So does the phone book.

964
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,155
I went to see him.

965
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,491
I told her it was okay to go.

966
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:49,826
Look, he's a leader.

967
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,077
He's a gadfly.

968
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,120
He's earning people's trust.

969
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:57,250
Every income level, first responders…
That's what we should be doing.

970
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,961
If he says so, all of them will sue.

971
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:03,965
What's he asking for?

972
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,800
You should ask him yourself.

973
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,443
Charles.

974
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:26,863
Mr. Feinberg.

975
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,157
I'm sorry they left you in here
with the music running.

976
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,492
- Oh.
- Uh…

977
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,494
- Soothes the soul.
- Yeah.

978
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:37,832
Yeah, this was the Lincoln Center cast,
if I'm not mistaken.

979
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,751
Bartoli was otherworldly.

980
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:44,714
Wow, you're an opera fan.
I was on the board that year.

981
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,799
My wife, Katherine, she was, uh…

982
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,344
She sang soprano
in an amateur touring choir.

983
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:52,138
I sing tenor. That's how we met.

984
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,974
Well, she must have had a lovely voice.

985
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,060
Yep.

986
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,815
Would that help her fit into your formula?

987
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,485
Do you read my website?

988
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,947
I will confess I don't,
because I'm not a computer guy.

989
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,241
- Ah.
- My staff handles all that,

990
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:16,203
and they tell me
you're a very reasonable man.

991
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,455
And as I understand it,

992
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,749
you've taken on somewhat
of a leadership role

993
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,501
uh, amongst the people that we serve.

994
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,297
- Mm-hmm.
- That's nice. Good. Good.

995
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:31,010
- Uh, why don't we talk?
- That's why I'm here.

996
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:35,306
Tell me what you want.

997
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,851
Because we could make some adjustments.

998
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,271
We could, uh, you know,
raise the baselines.

999
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,566
So you think this is about the money?

1000
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:47,693
Hmm, of course, yeah.

1001
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,487
That it's greed?

1002
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:53,157
No. No, no, no, no. Not greed.

1003
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,117
Money, yes. Greed, no.

1004
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,329
Money puts food on people's tables

1005
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,331
and it puts roofs over people's heads.

1006
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,750
There's nothing dirty
or demeaning about it,

1007
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:07,421
but let's not pretend
like it doesn't matter. It does.

1008
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,923
It helps people move on.

1009
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:11,884
Who?

1010
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,305
- What do you mean who?
- Do you know any of our names?

1011
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:19,058
Have you met any of us yourself?

1012
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,268
As a matter of fact, I have, yeah.

1013
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:22,353
Huh.

1014
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:24,981
And what were they worth?

1015
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:26,565
Oh.

1016
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,901
Well, now…
Now you're talking about numbers,

1017
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,945
and you know, pretending...

1018
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,029
Throw it out.

1019
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,407
Throw what out? Throw what out?

1020
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,576
- Throw out your formula.
- I can't. I can't.

1021
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,745
We need to have something rational.

1022
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,373
I got it. I understand. I got it.

1023
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:46,002
But my wife is not a statistic.

1024
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,880
No, certainly not,
but we do have to go by a set of rules.

1025
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,092
Okay. Will your rules help Graham Morris?

1026
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:57,680
Graham Morris. His partner died
two weeks before their civil ceremony,

1027
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:00,433
but your fund would give
his full claim to his parents

1028
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,976
who condemned his lifestyle.

1029
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,270
- I recall him.
- They were estranged.

1030
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,189
Completely estranged, Mr. Feinberg.
Is that fair?

1031
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,358
We're just the administrators on that.

1032
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:11,360
Let's go to the section
of your rules

1033
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,864
that limits injuries
to only those that occurred right away.

1034
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,408
We have cleanup workers
who come to our meetings.

1035
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,744
- They have polyps from asbestos.
- I think the thing...

1036
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,830
They were on that site for weeks,
for weeks, breathing in that crap.

1037
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,623
- Hmm.
- But according to your rules,

1038
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,877
unless they got to that site
within three days of the attack...

1039
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,047
Ah, that's because
we have to draw the line somewhere.

1040
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:35,176
If we award every worker
who was injured on that site,

1041
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:38,721
I mean, where does it end? You understand?

1042
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:41,766
I don't know, you tell me.
That's up to you.

1043
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,896
The law gives you broad discretion
as special master, does it not?

1044
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:48,731
- Yes, it does.
- Okay.

1045
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,567
And responsibilities.
Responsibilities to the taxpayers,

1046
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:52,985
to objectivity.

1047
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,364
I… I can't bend the rules
for every case that doesn't fit the mold.

1048
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,449
Why not?

1049
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:00,284
Congress did.

1050
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,329
You know they did.

1051
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:07,750
When the law said that we could sue
two airlines out of business,

1052
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,503
Congress rewrote that law like that,

1053
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,046
in a day.

1054
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:13,380
Why?

1055
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,425
Because the big corporations
asked them to.

1056
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:21,305
But when 7,000 citizens come to you
and they ask you for respect

1057
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,892
and ask not to be treated
like some numbers on a spreadsheet,

1058
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:27,394
you act like that law
came down from Sinai.

1059
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,856
Please, Mr. Feinberg, don't. Don't. Don't.

1060
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,317
Don't tell me
you can't give us what we want.

1061
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:36,403
Just tell us
that we are not the top priority.

1062
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:37,488
Admit that,

1063
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,448
to yourself.

1064
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,250
Over here.

1065
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,385
- Hello?
<i>- </i><i>Is this Kenneth Feinberg?</i>

1066
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:02,346
Come here. Come here. Goddamn it.

1067
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,474
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah, hi. Is this Kenneth Feinberg?</i>

1068
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,851
Yes. Who's this?

1069
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,352
<i>Bart Cuthbert, sir.</i>

1070
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:09,812
<i>Uh, we haven't met.</i>

1071
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:11,730
<i>I represent a claimant to your fund.</i>

1072
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,692
Uh, this is a private line.

1073
01:09:14,775 --> 01:09:16,777
Fund matters should go through my office.

1074
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,572
<i> Right, the office, yes.</i>
<i>I spoke to someone at the office</i>

1075
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,241
<i>who said you took the meeting
on this case yourself.</i>

1076
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:25,911
<i>Uh, it's a young woman
by the name of Karen Donato.</i>

1077
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:27,371
<i>Widow of Nicholas?</i>

1078
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,581
Yes, we spoke.

1079
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:34,378
<i> He was a fireman with three sons</i>
<i>aged, um, eight, six, and four.</i>

1080
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,131
<i>- Look...</i>
- What's this about?

1081
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:39,425
<i>Well, it's an unusual scenario,</i>
<i>you see.</i>

1082
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,386
<i>Look, I don't mean
to cause you any trouble, Mr. Feinberg.</i>

1083
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,805
Ken. Ken. No, go ahead. I'm used to it.

1084
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:48,184
<i>All right. Well, Ken,</i>
<i>you see, my client, Melanie Vale,</i>

1085
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,311
<i>was Mr. Donato's mistress.</i>

1086
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,774
- I'm not… I'm not sure I heard correctly.
<i>- You heard correctly.</i>

1087
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:58,861
<i>Melanie Vale and Nick Donato
have two daughters of their own</i>

1088
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:01,989
<i>ages one and three
at the time of the attack.</i>

1089
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:04,575
<i>Uh, I have DNA results to prove paternity.</i>

1090
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,952
<i>My secretary
can fax them over to your office.</i>

1091
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,039
<i>Mr. Feinberg?</i>

1092
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,582
Yes.

1093
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:16,754
Uh, all right. Well, I'm looking forward
to going over the papers.

1094
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,965
<i> Like I said,</i>
<i>I'm not trying to make trouble here.</i>

1095
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,427
<i>I just want you to know that when
you cut that check for Mr. Donato's life,</i>

1096
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,347
<i>it needs to go to five children
instead of three.</i>

1097
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,392
<i>I look forward to hearing from you soon.</i>

1098
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,505
Hey, mister.

1099
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,180
So your office said that you had, uh,
some more questions about Nick.

1100
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:12,434
Yeah. Really it's more
just of a… a record-keeping thing.

1101
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,270
I told you we don't want the money.

1102
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,146
- Of course. Yeah.
<i>- </i>Okay.

1103
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:19,858
Uh… Oh, look.
There's your wedding pictures.

1104
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,068
No…

1105
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,654
Okay, this is just for show.

1106
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,448
The real one was at City Hall.

1107
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,326
Before I was, you know,
as big as a circus tent.

1108
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:34,915
You know, I… I told him that I didn't need
anything all grand and fancy

1109
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,251
just to prove that he loved me, but, uh…

1110
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:40,796
You know, he worked doubles
for a whole year.

1111
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,925
He wouldn't take a nickel
from my family or anybody.

1112
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,095
Just so we could have
that picture on the wall.

1113
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,306
He was like that.

1114
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:56,812
And that, I'm assuming, Nicky Jr. there?

1115
01:11:58,022 --> 01:11:59,231
Oh no.

1116
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:04,236
Uh, that was a girl.
We lost her. She was a preemie.

1117
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,322
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1118
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:07,781
Eden.

1119
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:13,287
Most dads don't want little girls,
but Nicky always did.

1120
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:15,998
Hey.

1121
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,792
You didn't need to come.

1122
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:20,085
Sorry, excuse me.

1123
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,295
You didn't have to come.

1124
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,630
- I got cereal for the kids.
- Thank you.

1125
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,257
Hey! Hey!

1126
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,718
- I'll be right back. Sorry.
- Sure.

1127
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,345
Hi, Frank.

1128
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:31,930
I just wanted to, uh,

1129
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,683
discuss Nick's claim.

1130
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:38,228
I already told you, we're not making one.

1131
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,439
Yeah, I know, of course, but I just…

1132
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,275
You know, just in case Karen decides to…

1133
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,444
Here, let me… Can I show you something?

1134
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:50,407
This… I wanna show this number here.

1135
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,078
That's just, uh…

1136
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:57,247
That's a presumptive calculation.
That means…

1137
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,249
I know what it means to presume.

1138
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,424
You and Nick were… were very close.

1139
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:11,136
Yeah.

1140
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,972
He was my kid brother.

1141
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,601
So I… I have to assume

1142
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:18,936
you would know

1143
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:22,356
if there was something that Nick

1144
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:26,402
wouldn't necessarily want Karen to know.

1145
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,199
My brother was a family man.

1146
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,576
Of course. Of course, yeah.

1147
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:40,249
We are not signing nothing.

1148
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:43,669
Frank, this is money for those boys.

1149
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:45,671
It's tax-free.
It's not every day the government...

1150
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:49,425
Nicky died 'cause of people like you
holding the purse strings.

1151
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:52,094
Now you think you could come here
and make it right

1152
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:53,971
by tossing money on his grave?

1153
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,560
Get out of his house.

1154
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,439
All right.

1155
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,923
<i>See, this is Tom Jr.</i>

1156
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,426
<i>Don't you think he looks older?</i>

1157
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:37,055
Tom Jr.'s the one not in uniform.
He was a civilian contractor.

1158
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,225
His brother, Dave,
rejoined to fight for him.

1159
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:42,019
That's very brave.

1160
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:44,062
They were only 11 months apart.

1161
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,773
Like two peas in a pod growing up.

1162
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,153
I had a chance to meet Tom's partner,
Graham Morris.

1163
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,905
- The gold digger?
- Tom.

1164
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,911
What my husband means to say
is that man is a liar.

1165
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:03,290
He and Tom were living together.
He said that they had plans to...

1166
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:05,042
They were roommates.

1167
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,504
Tom had girlfriends. He would…

1168
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,048
- Mrs…?
- Biros.

1169
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:15,135
Mrs. Biros, this boy had a long history

1170
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,679
of being infatuated with our son.

1171
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:21,058
He tried to get his hooks in him,
but Tom did…

1172
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,103
We knew our son.

1173
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:30,108
These guys just crawl out of the woodwork.

1174
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,779
I'm sure your office sees a lot of those.

1175
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,824
I didn't get that sense from him.

1176
01:15:39,409 --> 01:15:40,953
Isn't that always the way?

1177
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,300
Rumor has it
that your numbers are a little stagnant.

1178
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,677
Still plenty of time.

1179
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,221
You had plenty of time,
and you've signed what, 900?

1180
01:15:59,846 --> 01:16:01,557
That's… That's not enough, Ken.

1181
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,686
You know, I…

1182
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,147
I sat down with your friend, Charles Wolf.

1183
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,650
Wolf? Well, good luck with him.

1184
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,652
He's fighting for the "left behind,"
by the way.

1185
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,029
He's not trying to help
the rich get richer.

1186
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,741
See, it's that kind of accusation
that has people calling you insensitive.

1187
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:20,993
Doesn't matter.

1188
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,789
Anyway, I emphasized our common ground.

1189
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:28,041
A rising tide lifts all boats.

1190
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,210
I think
I'm mixing a metaphor.

1191
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,589
But the point is,
if his supporters join our cause,

1192
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,425
we have enough participants
to certify a suit.

1193
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:38,093
Hold on here.

1194
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,471
Are you threatening a class action?

1195
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,391
No, I'm offering to help you out here.

1196
01:16:44,474 --> 01:16:45,350
Bullshit.

1197
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,893
You can afford to roll the dice,

1198
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:49,479
to win or lose a case
over the course of 15 years,

1199
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:51,231
Most of those people cannot.

1200
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:55,068
Well, with all due respect, you haven't
met these people, your staff has.

1201
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:57,404
And I got news for ya.

1202
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,031
They hate your guts.

1203
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,158
Well, maybe they do, maybe they don't.

1204
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:04,286
What I'm offering them is a choice,

1205
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:07,080
and I'm here as a friend
to give you the same.

1206
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:12,502
Raise the ceiling on the top awards,
and I'll deliver everybody to your fund.

1207
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,379
Wrapped in a bow.

1208
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,468
Let's win this together, Ken.

1209
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,180
<i>This isn't the latest number,</i>
<i>is it, Ken?</i>

1210
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,015
Fifteen percent?

1211
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:29,102
John, we still have four months
till the statutory deadline,

1212
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,687
but I'm… I'm confident.

1213
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:31,897
Oh, I know.

1214
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:33,482
Confident.

1215
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,652
Companies are getting nervous, Ken.

1216
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,157
John, I didn't know we were, uh,
having a meeting with the airline lobby.

1217
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,159
I'm just here to listen.

1218
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,412
We're told Lee Quinn
is planning to bring suit

1219
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,414
unless you give more money at the top.

1220
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:52,292
Look, Quinn is not the issue.

1221
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,836
You really want to change the law
to help people?

1222
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:58,674
There are plenty
of emergency workers and firemen.

1223
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:02,469
They inhaled toxic chemicals.
Didn't get sick till months later.

1224
01:18:02,969 --> 01:18:05,180
- This law doesn't cover them.
- No.

1225
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:07,516
That would be unproductive.

1226
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:11,311
If you change rules, this gets kicked
back to the Congress for a comment period.

1227
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:14,648
- Have you experienced a comment period?
- No.

1228
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:18,110
They'll be on their soapboxes ten months
after the whole statute's kaput.

1229
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,070
The whole economy is in the toilet.

1230
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:22,280
Nobody gets anything,
including re-elected.

1231
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,241
So, yeah…

1232
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,201
No.

1233
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:28,954
Quinn only cares about
the people at the top

1234
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,123
'cause that's where he gets his paycheck.

1235
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:35,335
- His lawsuit is a problem for us.
- Look, I work for the taxpayers.

1236
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,962
We pay our share of taxes too.

1237
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,548
Yeah, but you don't have to look
the victims in the eye.

1238
01:18:39,631 --> 01:18:42,592
As the special master,
you have broad discretionary power,

1239
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:43,969
even within your formula.

1240
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:47,305
All we're asking is you use it here
to make Quinn happy so he goes away.

1241
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:52,394
Like I said Ken, neutral party.

1242
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:56,314
You have DOJ's support,

Mr. Feinberg?

1280
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,423
- I thought I might see you here.
- Uh…

1281
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,635
- Hello, Mr. Wolf.
- Hi.

1282
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:53,932
I think Katherine would have appreciated
this modern stuff, but I don't…

1283
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,810
I… I can't understand music
that you have to,

1284
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,646
you know, struggle to listen to.

1285
01:20:59,729 --> 01:21:01,273
You know?

1286
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:04,234
I… I do. Well, Puccini, it ain't.

1287
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,070
We can agree on that.

1288
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,323
So I thought
you'd be in the seat of honor.

1289
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,202
Oh.

1290
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:17,497
- That bad, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1291
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,166
You know, um…

1292
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:25,005
the reason I even wanted to do this,
was I really believed

1293
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:28,300
I should serve my country
in its time of need. I did.

1294
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,968
Maybe part of that's ego,

1295
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,013
but… here we are.

1296
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:38,894
I've got, what, 1100 families on board

1297
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:41,646
and 6,000 more to go.

1298
01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,316
Uh-huh. Yeah, well…

1299
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:48,653
I just want you to know
that I know the fund's not perfect.

1300
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:54,868
There are people who just don't fit
within the rules that we wrote.

1301
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:58,496
I know that.

1302
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:03,793
I honestly don't know

1303
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:06,379
what to do.

1304
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,468
Remember that you're not the bridge.

1305
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:13,929
Okay.

1306
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,598
Sounds like a fortune cookie.

1307
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:17,974
No.

1308
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:19,267
Katherine and I,

1309
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,771
this town that we lived in years ago
in Upstate New York.

1310
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:24,689
- Uh, Ithaca, you know.
- Uh-huh.

1311
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,108
There was
this gorgeous bridge.

1312
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:31,321
Depression-era. Beautiful.
To me? Beautiful.

1313
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:34,115
And developers wanted to knock it down

1314
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,576
'cause they were gonna
put in an interstate.

1315
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,787
So I got on the city council,

1316
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:42,499
and I spent two years,
and all of our savings,

1317
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:46,002
fighting for that hunk of concrete.

1318
01:22:47,879 --> 01:22:49,464
And when they demolished it,

1319
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,635
I sat around the house
moping for a couple of weeks,

1320
01:22:53,718 --> 01:22:55,303
feeling sorry for myself.

1321
01:22:56,346 --> 01:22:57,472
And then Katherine,

1322
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:03,645
you know, she looked at me one day,
and she told me that.

1323
01:23:05,438 --> 01:23:07,899
"You're not the bridge." Mmm.

1324
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,067
It is rubble,

1325
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,694
I'm not.

1326
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,862
I am still here.

1327
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:15,824
Mmm.

1328
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:18,284
Fighting a new lost cause, but you know…

1329
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,870
- Which is me, I suppose.
- No. No, no, no.

1330
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:24,582
No, that's… See, I have
nothing against you, Mr. Feinberg.

1331
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,959
- Look...
- I wanna make that clear.

1332
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:26,876
- Okay.
- Okay?

1333
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:30,922
I just… Look, I may have screwed
this whole thing up.

1334
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,215
Very possible.

1335
01:23:32,298 --> 01:23:34,300
But if I try to fix it now,

1336
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:37,387
if I even go on record
saying this thing even needs fixing,

1337
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:41,099
trust me, courts are gonna throw it back
to Congress and they'll let it die.

1338
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:44,102
Nothing for anyone, just dead.

1339
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:48,064
- Then it deserves to be.
- Why?

1340
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,984
- Because it's not perfect?
- No. No.

1341
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:53,987
Because it's not just.

1342
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:56,406
But I can't change that.

1343
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,533
Well, something has to change.

1344
01:23:58,616 --> 01:23:59,576
Find it.

1345
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,368
Call off the search party.
I found him.

1346
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:25,912
Did you sleep here?

1347
01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:27,497
I guess so.

1348
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:33,169
I was going through these cases,
the uncommitted ones.

1349
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:37,298
What's going on with that, uh…
the civil union suit you're working on?

1350
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,342
Um, that's one of dozens.

1351
01:25:39,425 --> 01:25:41,636
It won't be an issue
for New York residents

1352
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:44,305
'cause Pataki just extended
the spousal benefits

1353
01:25:44,389 --> 01:25:46,850
for gay people whose partners died.

1354
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,935
Virginia legislature feels differently.

1355
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:53,106
Then we gotta
call the governor, right?

1356
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:56,985
Look, obviously we can't help everyone
with special interests.

1357
01:25:57,068 --> 01:26:00,029
We still have to set limits,
but it's a start.

1358
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,740
Now, that's the civil union, right?

1359
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,577
Some of these poor people,
these first responders, this is trickier.

1360
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,453
They didn't know
they were sick for months.

1361
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,080
- Look at these. This is…
- Ken.

1362
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,332
I know.
We're gonna have to take the heat on it.

1363
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,918
We're gonna have to set the formula aside.

1364
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,503
- Ken...
- I know. I know. I know.

1365
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:19,799
I know. We're in the weeds here.
That's where we should be.

1366
01:26:19,883 --> 01:26:23,553
If we do this, we have to go
the whole way. Can't go halfway.

1367
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:26,014
We have to consider
every claimant individually.

1368
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:29,309
If they can't come here to see us,
we'll have to go and see them.

1369
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:30,977
You understand? Good.

1370
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,604
What? You don't like it.

1371
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:34,939
We love it.

1372
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,358
Oh. Good.

1373
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,361
All right, set some meetings.
I'm gonna get coffee.

1374
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:49,871
Me and a few of the other stronger guys,

1375
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:54,626
we pried open the doors
so that everyone could… could get away.

1376
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,254
But that's… that's when it happened.

1377
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:03,301
Uh, the oxygen ignited all the fuel and…

1378
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:11,476
that was it.

1379
01:27:12,352 --> 01:27:13,561
Guy like me thinks he's tough.

1380
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,939
Thinks he can handle anything
that's thrown at him.

1381
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:21,778
That's until you look in the eyes
of a five-year-old and a six-year-old,

1382
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:23,196
and you tell 'em that, uh…

1383
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:27,200
that you've been lying to 'em,

1384
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,245
and that, uh, Mommy's not coming home.

1385
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:35,792
…and asked me if he was wearing
his wedding ring, and I said, "No. Why?"

1386
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:40,004
You need something?

1387
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:43,424
Oh, I thought I'd join in, uh,

1388
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,635
just perhaps listen, but...

1389
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:47,178
Sandra, is that okay?

1390
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:55,270
Go on. Whenever you're ready.

1391
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,192
I used to ask each time he flew
for school or work,

1392
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,069
I would ask for his itinerary.

1393
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,490
Just so I could breathe a little easier

1394
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:10,326
knowing he landed…

1395
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,747
back on solid ground.

1396
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,009
It takes a parent to know that feeling…

1397
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:30,513
and I'll never have it again.

1398
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,146
It's a fishing fly.

1399
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:40,898
He made them…

1400
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,234
We made them together.

1401
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,904
My wife and I want you to keep it.

1402
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:50,074
Well, thank you.

1403
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:51,784
Thank you.

1404
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:59,042
<i>We were told, uh, because he</i>
<i>suffered about 90% burns over his body,</i>

1405
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:05,089
he might not appear
to be the same person we know him to be.

1406
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:10,553
And then we got a call
from the medical examiner's office

1407
01:29:10,636 --> 01:29:12,764
saying that there was a mix-up

1408
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,018
and we had to make another identification.

1409
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,229
It turned out we spent four days

1410
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:23,149
at the bedside of a stranger…

1411
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:27,195
…while Alex…

1412
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:32,533
While he died.

1413
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:37,455
<i>You know,</i>
<i>my wife and I, we were thinking,</i>

1414
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,832
<i>"Gosh, those poor people."</i>

1415
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,669
<i>Because at first, you assume
it's… it's happening to someone else.</i>

1416
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,880
<i>And then within a few hours,</i>

1417
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:49,467
<i>they, of course, confirmed
that she was there for a meeting.</i>

1418
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:53,596
<i>We realized we were one of those people.</i>

1419
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,556
<i>I mean, it… it was staggering.</i>

1420
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:58,434
<i> Sure. I'm sorry.</i>

1421
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:00,478
<i> I was on the 85th floor.</i>

1422
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:03,272
<i>We actually started
going down the stairs early.</i>

1423
01:30:03,356 --> 01:30:04,816
<i>Well, you can call me Jean.</i>

1424
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:07,276
<i>Jean, tell me more about your son.</i>

1425
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,612
<i>Like, when did he move away from Iowa?</i>

1426
01:30:09,695 --> 01:30:11,781
<i> In 1997.</i>

1427
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:14,784
<i>He got a job as an analyst right away.</i>

1428
01:30:14,867 --> 01:30:16,702
<i>He was actually so excited.</i>

1429
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:18,496
<i> It's up to you,</i>

1430
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,915
<i>but I think you should take
what the government's giving.</i>

1431
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,834
- <i> I got bad anxiety.</i>
<i>-  Jerry.</i>

1432
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:25,086
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't sleep much at all.</i>

1433
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:28,589
- <i>Yeah, I can't imagine.</i>
<i>-  I had to move out of the city.</i>

1434
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,550
<i>Couldn't bear seeing
the hole in the skyline.</i>

1435
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:33,886
<i>I want to do everything I can</i>
<i>to expedite this process.</i>

1436
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,264
<i>- Well, Florida's nice.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Yeah.</i>

1437
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:39,016
"It seems as if I don't feel anything,

1438
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,436
but inside I do."

1439
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:45,982
"Inside, I wanna burst
and just talk to everyone

1440
01:30:46,065 --> 01:30:48,317
about what I'm holding in."

1441
01:30:51,028 --> 01:30:52,822
"I wanna say how much pain I have,

1442
01:30:52,905 --> 01:30:55,741
and I wanna say
all the pressure that I have."

1443
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:00,746
"I have to control myself emotionally."

1444
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:04,500
<i>"I have to help with them
and be strong for them,</i>

1445
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:07,211
<i>but also still be strong for me."</i>

1446
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:09,839
<i>"My dad was good at that."</i>

1447
01:31:10,339 --> 01:31:12,258
<i>"I have to be the man that he was."</i>

1448
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,443
It's not enough.

1449
01:31:33,112 --> 01:31:35,448
So we keep going,
right up to the deadline.

1450
01:31:35,531 --> 01:31:38,117
Maybe we get the word out wider,
make a public statement.

1451
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:39,243
Nah.

1452
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,704
If you announce this publicly,
it starts to look like

1453
01:31:41,787 --> 01:31:45,625
there's a change in policy,
then the law goes back to Congress…

1454
01:31:50,087 --> 01:31:52,340
{\an8}What if
someone else announces it?

1455
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,176
So you're meeting with people.

1456
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:56,719
Yeah.

1457
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:02,600
And I hear you've been telling them
that you're throwing out the formula.

1458
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:06,312
Nope. The law gives me discretion,
which someone reminded me.

1459
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:07,730
So I'm going to use it.

1460
01:32:07,813 --> 01:32:12,902
But I promise you, if people come aboard,
I will do everything I can to help them.

1461
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,617
Guaranteed by what, your word?

1462
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,244
Oh, Charles. I… I mean…

1463
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:23,329
What?

1464
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,206
No, I'm sorry.

1465
01:32:25,289 --> 01:32:29,460
Mr. Feinberg,
you've been telling us for two years

1466
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:33,172
that you're nothing but a numbers cruncher
for the government,

1467
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,133
and now you're asking us to trust you.

1468
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,635
No, I'm asking you.

1469
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,930
You already have their trust,
and you earned it.

1470
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:42,932
Help them trust me too.

1471
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:47,436
Are you just trying to win?

1472
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,647
No, I'm trying to make things right.

1473
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:00,950
When's your deposition with Lee Quinn?

1474
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:03,703
Uh, Monday.

1475
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:07,498
He's gonna tell you you wanted kids.

1476
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,837
Forty-year-old married female
who was pregnant,

1477
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,715
or even she's just trying to get pregnant,

1478
01:33:16,215 --> 01:33:18,426
the damage settlement shoots way up.

1479
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,219
Way up. Skyward.

1480
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:22,805
And Quinn's gonna coach you
through every step.

1481
01:33:22,888 --> 01:33:25,266
When to cry, when to quiver your lip.

1482
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:30,855
How do you know this?

1483
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,481
'Cause we're the same guy.

1484
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:34,442
That's what I'd do.

1485
01:33:59,508 --> 01:34:01,135
<i>Ashcroft stood you up?</i>

1486
01:34:02,094 --> 01:34:05,514
<i> Uh, he's under pressure of his own.</i>

1487
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,227
Do you think it's a message?

1488
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,355
Give Quinn what he wants?

1489
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:14,649
I'm not suggesting it.

1490
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:18,944
There's still time. You always say
they'll come in at the deadline.

1491
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:20,780
What if I'm wrong?

1492
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,867
What if I'm wrong, Camille?

1493
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:31,290
Sorry.

1494
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:35,002
You did everything you could.
Everyone did everything they could.

1495
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,840
A call for you, Ken. Lawyer from Queens.

1496
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:41,092
Name's Cuthbert.

1497
01:34:41,175 --> 01:34:42,426
Take a message, please.

1498
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,346
He already left you three.
It's about the Donato case.

1499
01:34:45,429 --> 01:34:48,391
He says
if you don't tell the widow, he will,

1500
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:50,893
and tell you that you have until tomorrow.

1501
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,691
Ken?

1502
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,112
Grab my bag out of the trunk,
please.

1503
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,323
Come on, guys. It's time to come in.

1504
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:06,200
Karen isn't home yet.

1505
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,495
She told me you called.

1506
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:11,747
Said you wouldn't tell her why.

1507
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:13,582
When will she be back?

1508
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:16,752
Put away your checkbook.

1509
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:18,587
We're joining the lawsuit.

1510
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,466
Well, you'll… you'll do whatever
you have to do.

1511
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,220
Yeah. But you know better, right?

1512
01:35:26,303 --> 01:35:29,432
No, I… I would not presume or judge.

1513
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:30,391
Bullshit.

1514
01:35:31,016 --> 01:35:34,019
You see her being loyal to a dead guy,
you can't imagine why.

1515
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:37,440
Frank, the signing deadline is Saturday,

1516
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:40,818
and after that you won't see me anymore.

1517
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,197
It's the first thing you said
I'm glad to hear.

1518
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:49,493
I'm still gonna
have to talk to Karen first.

1519
01:35:50,035 --> 01:35:52,163
Yeah, like I said, she's not home.

1520
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,373
Tell me, I'll pass it along.

1521
01:35:55,332 --> 01:35:57,084
I don't think you would, Frank.

1522
01:35:57,168 --> 01:35:59,170
In fact, I think you already know.

1523
01:36:01,172 --> 01:36:04,508
You don't have to protect him anymore.
Nick's gone.

1524
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:07,428
You didn't know Nick. He was a good man.

1525
01:36:08,512 --> 01:36:09,930
This is not about Nick.

1526
01:36:18,731 --> 01:36:20,107
He went back in for me.

1527
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:21,734
Into the tower.

1528
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:24,612
- Did you know that?
- No.

1529
01:36:26,363 --> 01:36:29,074
For all I know,
he heard the evac orders on his radio,

1530
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,410
and he said,
"Fuck it, my brother's in there."

1531
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:33,996
He died trying to save me,
and you think I should…

1532
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:35,664
I should forget about that?

1533
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,626
Don't you have a family?

1534
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,046
If you died tomorrow, what's the worst
they'd find out about you, huh?

1535
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:44,882
- Maybe you're not such a hero either.
- I'm not a hero.

1536
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:46,675
Yeah, well, Nick was.

1537
01:36:46,759 --> 01:36:49,345
Nick was.
He was a family man. He was a good man.

1538
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:51,806
And that's why
he'd want his children taken care of.

1539
01:36:52,306 --> 01:36:53,307
All of them.

1540
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:55,851
Frank, if I were you,

1541
01:36:56,644 --> 01:36:57,520
honestly,

1542
01:36:58,771 --> 01:37:00,231
I don't know what I would do.

1543
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,273
I can't imagine.

1544
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:04,527
I might… I might wanna sue the hell
out of everyone.

1545
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:07,696
But you're not the only ones left behind.

1546
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,198
I know you know that.

1547
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:14,662
That family wants the money
so they can just move on,

1548
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:16,622
and I think they deserve it,

1549
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:18,874
and I think Nick would think so too.

1550
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:24,296
That's why I'm…

1551
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:27,842
I'm gonna count them
as equal beneficiaries.

1552
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:29,677
I just thought Karen should know,

1553
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,512
and I wanted to tell her myself

1554
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,765
so she didn't have to read it
in the public record.

1555
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:35,975
What are their names?

1556
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:37,726
- Karen, go back in the house.
- No.

1557
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,854
I wanna know.

1558
01:37:43,983 --> 01:37:45,860
Uh, Jenna and Belle.

1559
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,747
He always wanted girls.

1560
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,470
You happy?

1561
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:50,174
Mail's here.

1562
01:38:54,553 --> 01:38:56,972
- Do y'all wanna sign for these together?
- I'll sign.

1563
01:39:00,643 --> 01:39:02,811
What's it look like there?
How many we got?

1564
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:09,526
- How many do you have?
- Thirty. Maybe 40.

1565
01:39:10,736 --> 01:39:11,820
Me too.

1566
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,218
I'm sorry.

1567
01:39:36,011 --> 01:39:38,764
You did the best you could.

1568
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:41,517
Did I?

1569
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:44,436
I'm still sorry.

1570
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:55,614
You just ask the question?

1571
01:39:58,283 --> 01:39:59,451
Five.

1572
01:39:59,535 --> 01:40:02,621
One, two, three, four, five.

1573
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:44,872
You're working too hard, Ken.

1574
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:49,084
- Get yourself a drink.
- No, I'm… I'm fine.

1575
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,128
Let's just get on with it.

1576
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,132
Don't think I don't respect it.

1577
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:58,427
Your whole crusade.

1578
01:40:59,344 --> 01:41:01,972
- That's not what this is.
- No, I know. I know.

1579
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:05,517
You're Robin Hood.
You're solving everybody's problem

1580
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:06,810
one good deed at a time.

1581
01:41:09,855 --> 01:41:11,315
You poisoned the well.

1582
01:41:12,107 --> 01:41:13,192
You did, Lee.

1583
01:41:13,776 --> 01:41:16,236
You poisoned the well.
You played on people's fear

1584
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,489
and their pain and their anger,

1585
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,407
their distrust of government<i>,</i>

1586
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:22,826
to act against their own best interest.

1587
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:25,954
Look, my girl's birthday is today.

1588
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:27,247
Caterer's coming.

1589
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:30,459
- You gonna meet these numbers or what?
- Give me a pen.

1590
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:38,675
Look, I know, I know it hurts,

1591
01:41:39,176 --> 01:41:41,011
but fair is not the goal.

1592
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:43,514
It's finish and move on.

1593
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:47,309
What?

1594
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:52,731
I said that.

1595
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:55,150
Yeah, you probably did.

1596
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:58,070
You've always been my hero, Ken.

1597
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:01,782
I watched you argue
in front of Fuld, 1984.

1598
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:03,951
You had hair then.

1599
01:42:04,034 --> 01:42:07,871
Doubt you believed a word you said,
but, man, did it sound good.

1600
01:42:09,706 --> 01:42:11,834
What are you doing? Ken.

1601
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:15,587
Don't be an idiot.

1602
01:42:17,089 --> 01:42:18,173
Ken.

1603
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:19,800
Come on, man.

1604
01:42:20,676 --> 01:42:22,010
Change your high, Lee.

1605
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:24,763
Ken.

1606
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:25,681
Ken!

1607
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:18,442
Ken.

1608
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,236
- What is going on here?
- The families.

1609
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,865
It's been like this all morning.
Some calls, some walk-ins.

1610
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:26,992
Suddenly everyone
wants to have a private meeting.

1611
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:28,660
Why?

1612
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:36,585
"By now, many of us have sat down
with Mr. Feinberg, looked him in the eye."

1613
01:43:36,668 --> 01:43:39,296
"We've told him
it's not the money that we're after."

1614
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:44,134
"It's for our own government, this system,
to treat us all with dignity, respect."

1615
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:46,720
"Well, I can't speak for the system,

1616
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:49,514
but I have come to believe
in Mr. Feinberg."

1617
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:54,353
"That's why I'm happy to announce
the fund is fixed."

1618
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:56,980
We just passed 65%.

1619
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,440
Oh my God.

1620
01:43:58,523 --> 01:44:01,109
All right, let's keep going, everybody.

1621
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:03,570
- We're really doing it.
- Well done, everybody.

1622
01:44:03,654 --> 01:44:04,988
I'm still looking at it.

1623
01:44:05,113 --> 01:44:07,241
- I need your number right there.
- Yeah.

1624
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:09,284
Would you be able
to bring that by before 3:00?

1625
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:10,327
Uh-huh.

1626
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,079
Is that Richmond?

1627
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:14,873
- I need that as soon as you're done.
- Yeah, yeah.

1628
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:17,376
Well, I know your kids start school soon.

1629
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:22,464
If you would like,
we can fax a redirect payment

1630
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:24,841
right into the tuition account,

1631
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:26,843
and, uh, that would be helpful.

1632
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,011
How's that sound?

1633
01:44:28,512 --> 01:44:32,975
What… What I can do is, um,
is fax the materials to a copy center.

1634
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,434
Are you near one of those?

1635
01:44:34,518 --> 01:44:37,062
Uh, you know what?
I can look that up for you.

1636
01:44:37,145 --> 01:44:39,481
You're… You're still
at the Arthur Ave. address?

1637
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:48,657
Hello.

1638
01:44:49,658 --> 01:44:50,492
Charles.

1639
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:53,829
I should get back to it.

1640
01:44:54,413 --> 01:44:55,956
- Nice to see you.
- You too.

1641
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:57,916
Here you go.

1642
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:00,711
There's still a typo on page three.

1643
01:45:01,336 --> 01:45:02,754
We'll get right on that.

1644
01:45:03,755 --> 01:45:06,341
And, uh, you were wrong about Lee Quinn.

1645
01:45:06,925 --> 01:45:08,552
He didn't try to coach you?

1646
01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:10,012
He did,

1647
01:45:10,595 --> 01:45:13,432
but you're nothing like him.

1648
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:18,937
Bye, Mr. Feinberg.

1649
01:45:21,523 --> 01:45:22,357
Ken.

1650
01:45:35,620 --> 01:45:39,624
No, Mrs. Benson.
I've been, uh, handling your claim myself.

1651
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:44,296
Uh, I know there's been an issue
with your husband's life insurance offset.

1652
01:45:44,379 --> 01:45:46,506
And look, I've been fiddling
with the numbers,

1653
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:48,592
and, uh, I want to propose something.

1654
01:45:48,675 --> 01:45:50,135
I think you're gonna like it.

1655
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:53,347
We just wanna make sure
you have everything together.

1656
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:56,141
This looks good to me.
You filled it out well.

1657
01:45:56,725 --> 01:45:58,310
You guys wanna give me a hand here?

1658
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:02,481
There's a lot more
down in the truck.

1659
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:04,399
Please tally it up.

1660
01:46:04,483 --> 01:46:05,317
Thank you.

1661
01:46:05,942 --> 01:46:08,070
All right.
Come on, guys, let's go.

1662
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:09,613
Let's go, let's go.

1663
01:46:14,576 --> 01:46:16,745
Okay, what have you got?

1664
01:46:18,413 --> 01:46:21,124
A little over 95% so far.

1665
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:24,503
Should we call the president?

1666
01:46:24,586 --> 01:46:26,254
Let's get drunk.

1667
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:29,091
Let's get drunk with the president.

1668
01:46:30,675 --> 01:46:31,676
Yeah.

1669
01:46:56,868 --> 01:47:00,622
Mr. Morris, this is Camille Biros
from the Victim Compensation Fund.

1670
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,252
I'm sure you've heard the news.

1671
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:11,299
You should know
because of your case,

1672
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:16,221
we were able to accommodate
a great number of people

1673
01:47:16,304 --> 01:47:18,682
in similar relationships in New York.

1674
01:47:22,644 --> 01:47:23,645
But, um…

1675
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:26,106
unfortunately,

1676
01:47:27,357 --> 01:47:32,737
Tom's parents being how they are,
and Virginia state law,

1677
01:47:32,821 --> 01:47:35,949
we were not able to accommodate yours.

1678
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:40,162
I'm so sorry.

1679
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,959
I'm sure that doesn't help.

1680
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:00,974
Excuse me, sir.

1681
01:48:02,225 --> 01:48:04,644
Hey. Uh, you know, I just…

1682
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:06,563
I'm gonna talk to him real quick.

1683
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:10,775
Hey, Mr. Feinberg. I, uh…

1684
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:14,821
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Come on. Come on over here.

1685
01:48:17,365 --> 01:48:18,742
I, um…

1686
01:48:21,703 --> 01:48:22,704
I just…

1687
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,249
I didn't wanna know.

1688
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:28,418
I'm not stupid.

1689
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:30,045
You know?

1690
01:48:32,964 --> 01:48:35,634
He'd get a call after dinner,

1691
01:48:36,635 --> 01:48:38,303
and he would say it was Frank,

1692
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:42,933
you know, and there was, like,
a three-alarm in the city or whatever.

1693
01:48:44,476 --> 01:48:45,936
He'd kiss me goodbye,

1694
01:48:46,019 --> 01:48:48,647
and I would pretend like
I didn't know that he was lying.

1695
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:51,650
Then later, I'd be over with Irene,

1696
01:48:51,733 --> 01:48:54,528
and Frank would come home
after drinking with the boys.

1697
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:57,364
And I would say,
"How'd that three-alarm go?"

1698
01:48:57,447 --> 01:48:59,157
And, you know, he would look at me

1699
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:03,078
with the straightest face you've ever seen
in your life, and he'd say,

1700
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,748
"Nicky's mopping up,

1701
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:09,751
but he was a real hero tonight."

1702
01:49:09,834 --> 01:49:11,086
"You should've seen him."

1703
01:49:13,171 --> 01:49:16,007
"Might be a while though,
so don't wait up."

1704
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:21,638
And, you know,
I don't… I don't hate Frank for that.

1705
01:49:22,847 --> 01:49:24,808
Because Nicky was his little brother.

1706
01:49:27,310 --> 01:49:28,979
I didn't want him to die.

1707
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:30,313
