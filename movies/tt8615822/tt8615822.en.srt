00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:35,189
<i>You can't leave us here.</i>

4
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:36,958
<i>You can't leave us.</i>

5
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,227
<i>It's been two years</i>

6
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,096
<i>since their mother ship arrived
out of nowhere,</i>

7
00:01:15,129 --> 00:01:17,298
<i>sending thousands
of unmanned drones</i>

8
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:20,234
<i>to reek havoc across
every country on the planet.</i>

9
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:23,305
<i>Billions of us died.</i>

10
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:26,140
<i>What came next
was the real test.</i>

11
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:28,210
<i>An invasion force,
hell-bent on destroying</i>

12
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:30,745
<i>what was left of humanity.</i>

13
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:33,180
<i>If it wasn't for a handful
of brave men and women,</i>

14
00:01:33,213 --> 00:01:36,852
<i>they would have succeeded.</i>

15
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:39,054
<i>We were successful in our first
counter-assault.</i>

16
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:41,423
<i>Even gained allies
amongst some of the Greys</i>

17
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:44,960
<i>wanting this war to end.</i>

18
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:47,995
<i>But now, the alien leaders
tighten the noose,</i>

19
00:01:48,028 --> 00:01:51,233
<i>take ground,
kill more of our forces.</i>

20
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,938
<i>I fear that the worst
is yet to come.</i>

21
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,746
Stop.

22
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:09,216
Careful what you wish for.

23
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:18,259
Step inside my office, boys,

24
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:21,063
And, the girl.

25
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:23,365
What I'm about to show you

26
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:27,468
has only been known
to a handful of people.

27
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:31,439
Even less have ever seen this.

28
00:02:31,473 --> 00:02:32,908
Scientists discovered it

29
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:36,444
embedded in the sea floor
in 1966.

30
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:38,814
They shipped it here.

31
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:41,383
This is Project Rainfall.

32
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,394
Steady up, boys!

33
00:02:53,427 --> 00:02:55,229
- It's just shrapnel.
- <i>Sunray!</i>

34
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,099
<i>Third resistance
taking heavy fire!</i>

35
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:58,834
<i>Secure that wall
and get them out!</i>

36
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:00,167
Third resistance,
hang tight.

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,037
We're almost there.

38
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:18,753
Third resistance is in there!
We need to get them out!

39
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:22,189
Second platoon with me.
The rest, left flank.

40
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:29,396
Three squad, this is Sunray.

41
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,831
We are inbound, over.

42
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:32,134
<i>Get us out of here, now!</i>

43
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,775
Cover! Cover and fire!

44
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,443
Where are you lot going?

45
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:45,247
Need to cross.
Get behind their lines.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,782
They're hitting us hard.

47
00:03:46,814 --> 00:03:48,250
We've held this position
for two days.

48
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:50,251
You want to go across?
We'll cover you.

49
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:52,954
But it's your funeral.
Go! Go! Go!

50
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:08,969
Three squad?

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,442
<i>We've lost them, Sunray.</i>

52
00:04:14,475 --> 00:04:16,111
<i>Third squad's gone.</i>

53
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,014
<i>All units be advised.</i>

54
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,483
<i>Mission compromised.</i>

55
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,151
<i>Intel is on the move.</i>

56
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:25,187
<i>Heading western settlement.</i>

57
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,422
<i>We have multiple KIA
calling for exfil.</i>

58
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:29,990
<i>Whisky One,
this is Drop Bear Actual.</i>

59
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:31,393
<i>We've bridged
the western settlement.</i>

60
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:33,461
<i>We are good to go
for that intel.</i>

61
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:34,996
Copy, Drop Bear Actual.

62
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:36,363
Good work.

63
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:38,533
You're our last chance.

64
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:12,299
Your intel about this
better be right...

65
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,102
or you'll end up
like your mate down there.

66
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,177
Whisky One,
this is Drop Bear Actual.

67
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,978
<i>The fox is in the henhouse.</i>

68
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:26,447
Green light to resistance
incursion.

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,082
Zorro call sign.

70
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,584
Mission is a go.

71
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:35,056
Copy, Whisky One.
Starting our run.

72
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:44,132
Go! Go! Go!

73
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:46,001
Go! Go!

74
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:55,377
Tigers, break off and engage
ground targets.

75
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,045
Fighters, on me.

76
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,336
Let's go!

77
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,151
Taking heavy fire.

78
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,320
Better make this quick,
Drop Bear.

79
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,694
Go! Go! Go! Go!

80
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,629
Don't stop!

81
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,725
<i>Whisky One, be advised.</i>

82
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:19,426
<i>first resistance entering
target area now.</i>

83
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:21,963
<i>Watch for friendly fire.</i>

84
00:07:37,677 --> 00:07:39,281
Aah!

85
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:49,024
Matt!

86
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:53,028
Whoa!

87
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,131
Eyes on first
resistance.

88
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:32,199
<i>Intel secured.
Prisoners freed.</i>

89
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:34,401
I'll open my last case of Scotch
for you, Drop Bear Actual.

90
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:36,637
Zorro call sign.

91
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,807
You blow that fucking settlement
back to their stone age.

92
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:42,143
<i>We've still got
friendlies in the area.</i>

93
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:43,677
<i>That is an order.</i>

94
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,547
<i>Our Greys are still down there.</i>

95
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,415
<i>Drop your payload
and get out of there.</i>

96
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,817
Copy, Whisky Actual.

97
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:55,456
Boom.

98
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:22,317
Take what you want,
use what you take.

99
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,884
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I'll have one.

100
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:26,153
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

101
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:27,721
Take what you want,
use what you take.

102
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:29,124
Okay, move it.

103
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,528
On you go.

104
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,302
Bloody Grey lover.

105
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:44,873
What a bitch
to the cause you are.

106
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,840
Go get 'em, Amelia.

107
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:58,653
You know what I miss, Amelia?

108
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,655
Chocolate macadamias.

109
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,657
Jesus, they were good.

110
00:10:04,357 --> 00:10:06,193
Straight ahead,
through the arch.

111
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,947
Oh, it's a kid.
Just a kid.

112
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,449
She was spying on us.

113
00:10:28,481 --> 00:10:30,418
Please, no...

114
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:32,220
This technology
belongs to my kind.

115
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:35,389
You're famous.

116
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:37,424
- There's a price on your head.
- It was just for food.

117
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,927
Please, I'm starving.

118
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:44,631
You remind me more and more
of my ex-wife.

119
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,266
Very maternal.

120
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:48,235
You look a bit
like her too.

121
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:49,671
Let's go.

122
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:27,442
He says they have 57.

123
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:29,576
I wonder how many of them...

124
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,579
Fighters. Fourteen.

125
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,313
Twelve efficient.

126
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:35,783
The remainder
are sick children.

127
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:37,418
Not bad.
She needs to ask about weapons.

128
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:39,887
No weapons and supplies.
We should...

129
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,024
Ask for intel to trade,
Amelia.

130
00:11:43,057 --> 00:11:46,260
What? You took too damn long.

131
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:55,637
Something big is coming.

132
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:57,504
The Kali.

133
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:58,773
Kali?

134
00:11:58,806 --> 00:12:00,708
Protectors of the Elders.

135
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,776
He is frightened.

136
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:06,281
There is talk of Rainfall.

137
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:10,550
What the hell is Rainfall?

138
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,453
Covert extraction.

139
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:19,527
Foxtrot, this is Zulu.

140
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,762
We request immediate
extraction.

141
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,333
Anything else
on Rainfall?

142
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:00,834
Not yet,
but we're on it, ma'am.

143
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,337
Shit. Sorry.

144
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,772
Oh, it's okay.
It's just Amelia.

145
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,707
How are you doing?

146
00:13:07,607 --> 00:13:09,609
Sleeping better?

147
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:11,546
Sometimes.

148
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:13,814
And sometimes
I wake up screaming

149
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,983
from what they did to me.

150
00:13:17,618 --> 00:13:18,920
But you came back for us.

151
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:21,689
You, Abraham, Matt.

152
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:25,659
Shit, sorry. It's Matt.

153
00:13:25,692 --> 00:13:27,095
It's okay.
It was a long time ago.

154
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:29,663
No. It's Matt.

155
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,566
Suarez!

156
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,935
Get this to Intel
right away.

157
00:13:35,168 --> 00:13:37,672
Matthew, where did you get that?

158
00:13:37,705 --> 00:13:39,507
Western Settlement.
Yesterday.

159
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:40,707
Big guy had it on.

160
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,343
Very angry.

161
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:44,712
Hi, sis.

162
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:46,747
How are you doing?

163
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,515
Just tired.

164
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:50,016
Give it to me.

165
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:51,418
You wish, Gary.

166
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:53,153
What is a Gary?

167
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:54,788
Well, you look like
a Gary to me.

168
00:13:54,822 --> 00:13:56,957
And we used to know a Gary,
didn't we?

169
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,393
Yeah.

170
00:13:58,426 --> 00:14:00,661
He had a wife, two kids.

171
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:02,963
Until one of you maggots
slaughtered them all.

172
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:05,098
I did not kill
this human.

173
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:07,000
I also knew a Jackson.

174
00:14:07,033 --> 00:14:10,170
But you're no Jacko,
are you, Gary?

175
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:11,972
- My name is...
- I reckon he looks

176
00:14:12,005 --> 00:14:13,774
a little bit
like a Richard?

177
00:14:13,807 --> 00:14:15,409
A bit of a dick.

178
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,415
Focus on that, Gary.

179
00:14:24,451 --> 00:14:26,486
When he says your name's Gary,
just agree with him.

180
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,990
You'll live
a lot longer.

181
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:31,725
See you around, Gazza.

182
00:14:52,145 --> 00:14:54,615
Hey.

183
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:06,993
So we have
established communication

184
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:08,863
with the European community
and the United States,

185
00:15:08,895 --> 00:15:11,698
and they have been hit very,
very hard.

186
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,602
Nuclear weapons were deployed...

187
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:17,205
unsuccessfully.

188
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:19,908
They hit none
of their targets.

189
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:24,078
Now, this situation
continues to decline

190
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,181
with the arrival of this new
command ship at North Head.

191
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:28,916
Greys are massing forces.

192
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:31,051
Significant forces
in all directions.

193
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:34,589
And we're suffering
unsustainable casualties here.

194
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,857
So, Sydney's lost.
We're surrounded.

195
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,894
I've got to be frank
with you here.

196
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,028
It's my military judgment
we need to evacuate

197
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:44,532
all resistance forces
and friendly civilians.

198
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:46,934
We're still
finding civilians.

199
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,836
Naturally there's going to be
collateral losses here.

200
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,072
- The crucial elements...
- Squadron leader,

201
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:54,107
what are your pilots
seeing out there?

202
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,810
They rarely see anyone out there
anymore, sir.

203
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,778
It's not that we don't want
to save everyone,

204
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:00,815
it's just,
as Commander Hayes said,

205
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,282
the Greys
don't need pilots.

206
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:04,018
We do.

207
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,586
Granted. Thank you, Robin.

208
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:08,122
Look, we've kept
the fighting in the city

209
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:09,656
the last 12 months,

210
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,592
and we really made
the Greys bleed.

211
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:15,964
Half a million Australians
owe their lives to you people.

212
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,966
We can't give up
on the rest.

213
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:20,301
Yeah, but we also can't
jeopardize our assets

214
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,835
and endanger the lives
of the pilots.

215
00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:24,272
Look, you did your best shot...

216
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:25,939
You gave a shot.

217
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:27,607
And we appreciate that.

218
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,644
But, Abe, I got to be honest
with you, mate.

219
00:16:30,277 --> 00:16:31,879
If you choose to stay,

220
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:33,214
you're going to do so
without air support.

221
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:34,781
That's not going to work.

222
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,083
It's as simple as that.

223
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:39,854
Okay.

224
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,989
Start the final evacuation.

225
00:16:42,021 --> 00:16:44,090
Wait. There's something else.

226
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:45,860
Over the past few weeks,

227
00:16:45,893 --> 00:16:48,062
I've encountered sources
that all speak of some event.

228
00:16:48,095 --> 00:16:49,663
Rainfall.

229
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,831
What's a Rainfall?

230
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:55,001
What is that, something that
the Greys cooked up for you?

231
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:57,171
Christ, they'll do anything
for an extra food ration.

232
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,338
These are credible Greys.

233
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:00,173
There's no such thing...

234
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,344
as a credible Grey.

235
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,946
And forgive me, but you're not
exactly in any position

236
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,815
to tell us what's credible.

237
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:09,683
We have confirmed that Rainfall
was on the data console

238
00:17:09,717 --> 00:17:12,753
that Matt's strike team
just captured.

239
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,221
It's the only human word.

240
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:18,192
Rainfall was the code name
for Pine Gap.

241
00:17:18,224 --> 00:17:20,360
American base
in Central Australia.

242
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:22,863
And this helmet
is from the Kali.

243
00:17:22,895 --> 00:17:24,731
Protectors of the Elders.

244
00:17:24,765 --> 00:17:28,970
If they are here,
it is for something important.

245
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:30,704
Okay.

246
00:17:30,738 --> 00:17:32,873
If it's important to them,
it's important to us.

247
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:34,709
We need to send a recon
out to Pine Gap.

248
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:36,277
You're talking about
a suicide mission here, Abe.

249
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:38,244
We need everything
we have to evacuate.

250
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,314
He's right, Abe. That gauntlet
run is going to be hell.

251
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,817
No, no, what we need
is to stop the Greys

252
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:44,718
from winning
this fucking war!

253
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,854
Do I have two volunteers

254
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,856
to go by ground transport
to Pine Gap?

255
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,659
I'll go.

256
00:17:54,428 --> 00:17:56,130
I'll go.

257
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:57,698
Anyone else?

258
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,000
I will go too.

259
00:17:59,032 --> 00:18:00,266
Okay, settled.

260
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:01,935
No.

261
00:18:01,969 --> 00:18:03,703
You can't send
this thing in there...

262
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,173
He's going to need
an interpreter.

263
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:08,876
All right.

264
00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:11,045
Let's start getting
those refugees loaded.

265
00:18:11,077 --> 00:18:13,748
Uh, Simmons, you and the Grey
will be on the first run out.

266
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,915
Good luck, everyone.

267
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:18,119
Okay, let's go.

268
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:20,354
We're all going
to the same place now.

269
00:18:20,386 --> 00:18:22,355
I can get you on the first
transport with Hayes' staff.

270
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,758
- Just do this for me, please.
- Sorry, boss.

271
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,394
That's why you love me.
Mwah.

272
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,296
What are you doing?

273
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:31,831
I need you here with me.

274
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:34,801
I was one of the first
to join your side.

275
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:39,273
Now, most of my kind,
and yours, wish me dead.

276
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,009
- Tell me about it.
- If the Kali are here,

277
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:46,346
I need to know why.

278
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,314
Okay.

279
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:49,049
Good luck.

280
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:55,288
No fucking way.

281
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,092
Now, you're a big boy.

282
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,127
Ride her like she's yours.

283
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:03,364
Vox. Not many left.

284
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:06,033
Very loyal creatures.
Noble.

285
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,436
- They're adorable.
- Fear not, Matthew.

286
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,305
How do you your people say?

287
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:12,772
Grow a pair.

288
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:14,409
Grow what, Gary?

289
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,111
Grow what?

290
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,113
Simmons.

291
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,315
I am sorry you have to travel
with that thing.

292
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,116
I'll be fine.

293
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,319
Well, if that piece of shit
tries anything funny...

294
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,788
The rounds are my own design.
Penetrates the armor.

295
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:30,290
Shredder rounds.
I'm good.

296
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,759
You can never be too careful.
What's the matter?

297
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,197
The settlement, yesterday.

298
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,865
- There were kids.
- Yeah.

299
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:40,433
- And they...
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

300
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:42,036
You can't think about that,
all right?

301
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:43,503
Those orders are on me,
you followed them,

302
00:19:43,537 --> 00:19:45,372
you got our people out,
all right?

303
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:48,108
You got our people out.

304
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:50,177
But we got bigger fish
to fry here, all right?

305
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,979
There's something more
about that night...

306
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:54,080
No. I don't want you
to think about that.

307
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:56,084
Find out what this Rainfall
thing is.

308
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,451
Report back to me.

309
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,087
Now take it.

310
00:20:01,154 --> 00:20:02,455
Matthew.

311
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:04,225
Time to load up.

312
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,463
Oh, Matt...

313
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,834
don't forget
who the enemy is, hmm?

314
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,169
Sure.

315
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:38,525
Let's go, Romeo.

316
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,127
Romeo. Gary.

317
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:43,931
Why do you insist
on calling me these names?

318
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:45,566
Cultural difference,
snapper-head.

319
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:49,269
The deeper shit we're in,
the harder we laugh.

320
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,805
Well, we do not.

321
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,173
By the time this is over, Gary,

322
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:54,040
you're going to grow
a sense of humor.

323
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:55,910
Or I'm going to shoot you.

324
00:20:57,978 --> 00:21:00,346
You got bigger things
to worry about than that, mate.

325
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,151
Hey, you be safe out there.

326
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:07,588
- You too, old man.
- Okay.

327
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:10,124
Come back to us,
all right?

328
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,858
Hey.

329
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:13,427
Hey! You going to say goodbye?

330
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,528
You going to keep making friends
with the enemy

331
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:17,530
while the rest of us fight?

332
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:20,100
- And die?
- Fuck you.

333
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,102
The ones that joined us
want this shit to be over,

334
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,503
just like us.

335
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:24,971
And none of them would ever
betray us?

336
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:26,173
Oh, I forgot.

337
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:28,442
Amelia, the human.

338
00:21:28,474 --> 00:21:30,844
The good thing for us,
you're never wrong.

339
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:33,413
Let's go, Gary.

340
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:41,355
All she thinks about is you.

341
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,890
She's your problem now, man.

342
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:46,559
Good luck, Matt.

343
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:48,196
You too.

344
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:54,134
All right, people,
let's load up.

345
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,269
This is the real deal.

346
00:21:56,303 --> 00:21:59,006
Final vehicle
and equipment checks.

347
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:01,975
All weapons active.

348
00:22:04,144 --> 00:22:06,313
It's going to get
a little bumpy out there.

349
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:07,647
Let's look out
for each other.

350
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:10,217
Go, go, go!

351
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,054
Stay low. Stay sharp.

352
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,191
You all know this shit.

353
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,027
Convoy!

354
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:25,432
Start it up.

355
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,239
Good luck, everyone.

356
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,688
Good evening, everyone.

357
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:51,025
I'm going to your
in-flight entertainment.

358
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:53,126
This is a nonsmoking,
pimped-out government bus,

359
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,629
unless we're smoking those
blood-like bastards up there.

360
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:57,264
All right.

361
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:00,334
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

362
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:01,601
Hurry.

363
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:07,942
Covert One,
we're on our way.

364
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,427
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Later.

365
00:23:31,597 --> 00:23:33,399
All right, come in.

366
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:37,538
This is Simmons, Gary,
and the rodents, good to go.

367
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,505
<i>Bus good to go.</i>

368
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:41,575
<i>Support vehicle standing by.</i>

369
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,676
<i>Convoy standing by.</i>

370
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,278
Prepare to open doors!

371
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,506
Here we go!

372
00:24:21,114 --> 00:24:22,615
Go! Go! Go!

373
00:24:32,625 --> 00:24:35,261
<i>We're going dark.</i>

374
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:37,331
<i>Lights out!</i>

375
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:48,576
<i>This is crazy.
We got to turn back.</i>

376
00:24:50,143 --> 00:24:51,812
No one goes back.

377
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:54,315
- We go through.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

378
00:24:59,251 --> 00:25:01,221
<i>Convoy's suffering
heavy losses.</i>

379
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,722
<i>Zorro, take Blackbird.
Cover the convoy.</i>

380
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:04,358
<i>Copy, Whisky One.</i>

381
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:06,226
<i>Incoming, on your right.</i>

382
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,627
Zorro, flight.
Drop to the deck

383
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:08,828
and keep the fighters
off their back.

384
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,230
Blackbird, Buzzard, Cobra.

385
00:25:10,262 --> 00:25:11,464
Try to lead them away.

386
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,534
<i>Copy that, Zorro.</i>

387
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:16,503
- <i>At six o'clock.</i>
- Call them as you see them.

388
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,112
Gary! Aerial targets!
Coming at two o'clock!

389
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:31,117
Come on,
you maggots!

390
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:35,056
Yeah!

391
00:25:43,195 --> 00:25:44,464
Keep the convoy tight!

392
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:46,200
<i>Where's our air support?</i>

393
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:52,472
Reports of the command ships
in the city lifting off.

394
00:25:52,506 --> 00:25:54,842
Fuck. I'll look into it.
Give me that one.

395
00:25:55,842 --> 00:25:57,511
Suarez, you okay?

396
00:25:57,544 --> 00:26:00,214
There's nothing we can do
for them now.

397
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:01,849
They will make it.

398
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:03,450
Hey.

399
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:05,385
I can't find Marcus.

400
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,567
Marcus.

401
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,770
- Stay down!
- Matt, I can help.

402
00:26:23,803 --> 00:26:25,739
I said stay down!

403
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,675
Gary! Protect that Vox!

404
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:41,855
Watch out!
Watch out in the back.

405
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:48,895
Everybody in the front
of the bus!

406
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:57,203
Keep them busy.

407
00:26:58,637 --> 00:27:00,540
Get down. Get down.
Look out.

408
00:27:00,574 --> 00:27:02,276
Look out. Get down. Get down.

409
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,678
Call sign, Zorro.
Come in, over.

410
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,382
Zorro. Who is this?

411
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:10,216
It's me. I've got a bus
full of people down here

412
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,852
with bad guys all over us.

413
00:27:11,884 --> 00:27:14,387
Hold on.

414
00:27:14,421 --> 00:27:16,523
Now or never, babe,
or we're dead!

415
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:18,225
Zorro, what are you doing?

416
00:27:25,498 --> 00:27:26,700
<i>I need assistance.</i>

417
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:28,402
<i>There's one on me.</i>

418
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,403
<i>Hold your line.
I got your back.</i>

419
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:39,779
Robin!

420
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,887
Yes! Whoo!

421
00:27:52,858 --> 00:27:54,727
That's my girlfriend.

422
00:27:56,563 --> 00:27:57,931
Beautiful work, Zorro.

423
00:27:57,963 --> 00:28:00,267
Thank you, sir.

424
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,567
Stupid kid.

425
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,604
Your sister's
going to be pissed.

426
00:28:03,636 --> 00:28:05,504
- Ooh!
- Amelia's fine.

427
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,874
What did you expect me to do,
just stay back by myself?

428
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:09,509
What if something
happened to you?

429
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:10,876
I don't want you here, kid.

430
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,778
He is not to blame
for your mistakes.

431
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:15,448
You cannot control him.
You have no discipline.

432
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,750
- You danger our mission.
- Stay out of it, Gary.

433
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:21,255
Why? The boy has hands.
A gun.

434
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:23,390
He is small and skilled,
like a Huzkit.

435
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:27,595
He's staying
with the convoy.

436
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:29,662
Base, this is Simmons.

437
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:31,631
Tell Amelia the kid's with me.

438
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:33,733
<i>Alien trackers
have reached the base.</i>

439
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:35,302
<i>Get back!</i>

440
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:45,545
Get back!

441
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:48,382
Go! Come on! Go, go, go!

442
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:49,849
Straight on the tracks.

443
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:52,419
Exit tunnel.
Drop that shit.

444
00:28:56,756 --> 00:28:58,892
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

445
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:08,302
<i>Second Division
is falling back.</i>

446
00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:10,971
<i>We'll go through the tunnel.
We're going back.</i>

447
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,838
Coming through, sorry.

448
00:29:12,872 --> 00:29:14,608
It's this way.
Come on, on the trucks.

449
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:16,009
- Greys, move back...
- Hey.

450
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,610
Hey.

451
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:18,878
We got to get out of here.
Let's go.

452
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,814
We wait. Humans first.

453
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,715
No, come on.

454
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:24,518
No, let's go.
You're coming.

455
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,787
You, on that
truck over there. Go on, move.

456
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:29,623
- Let these Greys pass.
- No. Not happening.

457
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:31,657
What? On whose orders?

458
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:32,925
Wing Commander Hayes.

459
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,594
This is bullshit.

460
00:29:34,626 --> 00:29:36,663
This way. That's it, people.

461
00:29:38,765 --> 00:29:40,934
Load up, people!
Come on!

462
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,805
Bailey! Get the gate open.

463
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:46,605
- What?
- That's it. Come on.

464
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:48,674
Come on.

465
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:02,388
Sydney's not going
to let us go.

466
00:30:04,656 --> 00:30:07,394
Down! Move! Move!
Move! Move!

467
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,000
<i>One, zero, niner, come in.</i>

468
00:30:15,034 --> 00:30:17,838
Zero Alpha, this is Bravo!
Send support! Over!

469
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:21,641
- <i>Atmospheric contact.</i>
- Zero Alpha, say again? Over.

470
00:30:21,673 --> 00:30:25,144
One, zero, niner, come in.
Atmospheric contact.

471
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:30,117
Unknown object falling at speed.
Origin: the alien colony ship.

472
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:32,619
<i>You need to evac now.</i>

473
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:38,892
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

474
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,626
Get down!

475
00:30:51,503 --> 00:30:55,475
Heading two, zero,
eight, east-southeast.

476
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,151
Impact with the city
is imminent.

477
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:07,186
Aah!

478
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,922
Get on, everyone!

479
00:31:17,797 --> 00:31:19,865
Come on, old man.

480
00:31:19,898 --> 00:31:21,067
Come on.

481
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,914
<i>Simmons? Are you there?</i>

482
00:32:09,582 --> 00:32:11,051
Copy.

483
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:13,519
<i>Sydney was just destroyed.</i>

484
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:17,757
Which part?

485
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:20,559
<i>All of it.</i>

486
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:21,961
<i>There'll be a reckoning, Matt.</i>

487
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:23,863
<i>Focus on the mission.</i>

488
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:26,265
<i>Find out what Rainfall is.</i>

489
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,836
<i>Stay out of the occupied zones.</i>

490
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,971
<i>We'll drop you off.</i>

491
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:32,839
Sir.

492
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:37,743
Gary, this is our stop.

493
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:40,713
Matt, I'm serious.
You can't just leave me here.

494
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:43,048
It's safer, Matt.
Three of us.

495
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:45,986
Get your gear, kid.

496
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:47,586
But you're riding
with him.

497
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:48,854
Me?

498
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:50,055
It was your idea.

499
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:51,524
Got a problem?

500
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:53,159
No, but if I did,

501
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:55,729
I wonder if it would be
a concern of yours at all.

502
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:57,498
He's learning.

503
00:33:30,262 --> 00:33:33,066
Making yourselves at home,
aren't you?

504
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,569
There are stories from our
planet from a long time ago.

505
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:40,140
I imagine it looked
the same as this.

506
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:42,107
Well, your planet's dead, so...

507
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,010
What are they doing?

508
00:33:46,211 --> 00:33:47,947
I do not know.

509
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,119
Hyah!

510
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:07,067
Is this going to be it?

511
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:10,003
Running.

512
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:12,204
Fighting. Hiding.

513
00:34:12,237 --> 00:34:14,873
Repeat.

514
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:16,175
Until we run out of luck?

515
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,911
Hey, hey, hey.

516
00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:19,947
Don't you start having doubts
on me now, girl.

517
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,821
This is temporary.

518
00:34:27,853 --> 00:34:30,155
Human beings have been on this
planet for 200,000 years.

519
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:34,159
We've had ice ages,
and the plague, and...

520
00:34:34,193 --> 00:34:37,631
and disco music,
and we've survived it all.

521
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:40,400
Seriously, why do you think
the Greys came?

522
00:34:40,432 --> 00:34:44,204
We are the success story
of the Milky Way.

523
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:18,071
<i>Attention, attention...</i>

524
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:25,945
All Greys to be vetted
before housing.

525
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,914
Why? Where are you taking them?

526
00:35:28,947 --> 00:35:31,083
Just security protocol, sir.

527
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:32,819
They'll be well looked after.

528
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:34,788
Well, you just make sure
that you do look after them.

529
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,755
These Greys are on our side,
all right? Go with them.

530
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:39,059
Follow me. This way.

531
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:43,163
- This way.
- Well done.

532
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:44,931
Hayes wants to see you all
right away.

533
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:46,398
<i>This is Commander Hayes.</i>

534
00:35:46,431 --> 00:35:47,933
<i>We are now at stand two.</i>

535
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,369
We are now at stand two.

536
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:52,204
Have you even been down there?

537
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,406
There's thousands of refugees
inside this base now.

538
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,376
They're frightened.
They're looking for answers.

539
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:58,711
I am in the business
of saving civilian lives.

540
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:00,880
I asked you to get me
the inventory.

541
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,715
- Do your job.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:36:02,748 --> 00:36:04,416
You can consider me
your shepherd.

543
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:06,185
Yeah, well,
we're not your sheep, mate.

544
00:36:06,219 --> 00:36:07,954
Yeah, you're dead right
about that, mate.

545
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:09,355
You know what?

546
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:11,156
You'll have your say
when the dust settles.

547
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,226
But right now...

548
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:14,793
right now you're wasting
my time.

549
00:36:14,827 --> 00:36:16,730
- Is that right?
- Get him out of here.

550
00:36:16,762 --> 00:36:18,465
Piss off.

551
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:23,269
Oh, Jesus,
you guys are alive.

552
00:36:25,905 --> 00:36:27,273
- Hey, mate.
- Hey, buddy.

553
00:36:27,306 --> 00:36:28,742
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

554
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:30,043
What was all that about?

555
00:36:30,076 --> 00:36:31,010
Oh, Wing Commander Dickhead
up there

556
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:32,445
is being a fascist.

557
00:36:32,478 --> 00:36:34,079
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
he'd have his reasons.

558
00:36:34,112 --> 00:36:35,481
Just relax.

559
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:37,416
That's what I love
about you, mate.

560
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:39,818
You're always ready
to give someone a chance.

561
00:36:39,851 --> 00:36:41,754
I'll be down with the civilians
when you're done.

562
00:36:41,788 --> 00:36:43,056
All right.

563
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:44,757
Abe, how the hell
are you, mate?

564
00:36:49,795 --> 00:36:51,964
They just hit us
with a fucking rock.

565
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,237
- We're still kicking.
- Yeah, we are.

566
00:36:58,271 --> 00:37:00,073
Amelia?

567
00:37:01,507 --> 00:37:03,476
- Josh, you remember Amelia?
- Yeah, of course I do.

568
00:37:03,509 --> 00:37:05,177
Welcome.

569
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,983
I think you'd both appreciate
what we've done here, actually.

570
00:37:11,016 --> 00:37:12,184
It's...

571
00:37:12,217 --> 00:37:14,253
It's pretty monumental.

572
00:37:14,286 --> 00:37:16,489
Why don't you come
take a look?

573
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:19,825
I don't understand where we are.

574
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:21,994
- What is this place?
- I thought you might know.

575
00:37:22,027 --> 00:37:23,195
- A bit your vintage.
- Really?

576
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:24,997
I retired,
I wasn't fossilized.

577
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,498
It's an old military research
complex from the '50s.

578
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:28,234
Then some high-power gradients
were added

579
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:29,434
by civilian scientists.

580
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:31,036
We had classified projects.

581
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,139
Vacant for about a decade
until we moved in,

582
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:35,809
began to fortify the bastard
over the last couple of years.

583
00:37:35,842 --> 00:37:37,410
Got everything here, mate.

584
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:40,413
Medical bays, hydroelectric
power stock stores.

585
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:42,315
Wing Commander Hayes
was stationed

586
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:44,349
at Air Force headquarters
before the occupation.

587
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,485
Stationed at a desk, I presume?

588
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:51,390
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
I was, Miss Chambers.

589
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:53,092
Tactical warfare
at the upper levels of Command.

590
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:55,027
But that's not what
you're asking, is it?

591
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:57,263
I just can't imagine
an officer in the field

592
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:58,998
would ditch our allies.

593
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,300
Oh, that was never
the intention, Miss Chambers.

594
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,935
What's this?

595
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:04,838
In the Sydney evac,
his men had orders

596
00:38:04,871 --> 00:38:06,105
to leave our Greys behind.

597
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:07,273
It's called protocol.

598
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:09,074
- It's protocol.
- Protocol?

599
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:11,010
- Yeah. It's called protocol.
- Okay. Yeah. Convenient.

600
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:13,112
Yeah. We moved essential
personnel first.

601
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:14,880
You know, I think you
and I might have got off

602
00:38:14,914 --> 00:38:16,149
on the wrong foot.

603
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:17,817
So...

604
00:38:18,483 --> 00:38:20,052
come with me.

605
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,326
<i>Attention. Attention.</i>

606
00:38:26,358 --> 00:38:30,362
<i>All vehicles inspected
prior to patrols,</i>

607
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:31,998
<i>as per orders...</i>

608
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,476
- What are they doing?
- Preparing for war, Abe.

609
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,546
That demands precision
and technical intelligence,

610
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,916
which we are receiving
from the Greys.

611
00:38:51,384 --> 00:38:53,186
It's their technology
integrated with ours.

612
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:54,855
It's a beautiful thing.

613
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,322
Go, go, go, go!

614
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:59,192
Let's go! Get down! Move it!

615
00:38:59,224 --> 00:39:02,094
Shit.

616
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:10,470
We got to help them out.

617
00:39:10,503 --> 00:39:12,472
No, they're done for, kid.

618
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:17,443
There might be something
we can use, though.

619
00:39:18,376 --> 00:39:20,012
- Come on.
- Matt...

620
00:39:20,045 --> 00:39:23,916
if we leave,
they're dead.

621
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:25,451
Okay.

622
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:27,653
You and old mate Gary here
take the left.

623
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:29,955
I'll go right.
Hit them with the cross fire.

624
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,691
Yup. Let's do it.

625
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:34,994
Except, Pow, you get hit by
those four trackers in the tree

626
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:36,496
you didn't see.

627
00:39:36,528 --> 00:39:38,164
We're all dead.

628
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:40,532
And no one finds out
what Rainfall is.

629
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:42,434
You've got to be smarter, kid.

630
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,103
Those are Kali craft.

631
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,637
All the more reason
to take them.

632
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,139
Right.

633
00:39:47,172 --> 00:39:48,507
I'm going to start
the shooting.

634
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,643
Wait until I draw them off.

635
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:52,644
Then what?
We come and get you?

636
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:54,446
Right. Gary?

637
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,382
Keep the boy safe.

638
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:57,650
And?

639
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:01,186
Take them out...
in the behind.

640
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:03,522
Whatever makes you happy,
Gary.

641
00:40:04,556 --> 00:40:06,024
Come on.

642
00:40:06,057 --> 00:40:08,128
Get our bags
and stay alert.

643
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:17,536
Go. Go.

644
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:24,076
Stay behind me,
all right?

645
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,179
Why should we
risk our lives?

646
00:40:26,211 --> 00:40:27,646
We should see
what they know.

647
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:29,281
There's too many of them.

648
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:31,050
Hmm.

649
00:40:32,717 --> 00:40:35,587
I suppose you got
a better idea, Gary?

650
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,356
I do.

651
00:40:39,425 --> 00:40:40,961
He does.

652
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,269
What the hell
are you doing, Gary?

653
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,173
This is stupid.

654
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:56,509
Just let him
do his thing.

655
00:41:02,414 --> 00:41:04,483
Screw it. Move, kid.

656
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:06,685
Move!

657
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:09,155
I'll kill them.

658
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:17,496
Get in! Get in! Get in!

659
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:30,777
Incoming!

660
00:41:30,809 --> 00:41:33,413
I see them. Kali.

661
00:41:41,086 --> 00:41:42,521
Protect us. Shoot.

662
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:46,391
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!

663
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:47,660
Fuck!

664
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:49,696
Fucking Gary.

665
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:57,770
Oh, this was a good idea.

666
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:22,362
Shoot them.

667
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:36,875
Got it!

668
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,762
Whoa!

669
00:43:32,597 --> 00:43:34,833
Take that craft.

670
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:41,306
Whoa!

671
00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:48,780
What the fuck?

672
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,788
Good.

673
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:12,871
Happy trails.

674
00:44:14,873 --> 00:44:16,442
Whoa!

675
00:45:10,728 --> 00:45:12,631
They eat meat.

676
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:15,433
They eat anything.

677
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,670
I have seen one
eat a large rock.

678
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:19,905
They enjoy iron.

679
00:45:19,938 --> 00:45:23,276
I told you they were
loyal creatures.

680
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:26,012
Finally figured out
I was on that ship, did you?

681
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:28,548
- Sorry.
- Lucky you're a bad shot.

682
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:32,285
And you had a good chat
to your mates, didn't you?

683
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:33,886
That means you've got
some intel for me.

684
00:45:33,918 --> 00:45:35,621
I would have known more

685
00:45:35,653 --> 00:45:37,789
if you hadn't
have fired upon them...

686
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:39,025
and me.

687
00:45:39,057 --> 00:45:41,326
Finger slipped.

688
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,030
Lucky you got away safely,
eh, maggot?

689
00:45:45,063 --> 00:45:47,832
Indeed.

690
00:45:47,865 --> 00:45:50,936
The Kali of these craft
are searching for Rainfall.

691
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:53,471
Well, that should
slow them down.

692
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:34,779
Can't sleep?

693
00:46:34,813 --> 00:46:37,483
Yeah, me neither.

694
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,126
How long
they have you for?

695
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:49,795
Six weeks.

696
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:58,337
My wife was
a pediatric nurse.

697
00:46:59,905 --> 00:47:03,376
Used to burn that midnight oil
16, 17 hours a night sometimes.

698
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:06,512
Drove me fucking nuts, man.

699
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:09,914
She'd come home
bloody knackered.

700
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:11,884
She'd just collapse
on the couch.

701
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:15,587
Not before she made me massage
her filthy little feet, though.

702
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:19,925
Katherine.

703
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,927
Bloody Katherine.

704
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:25,498
My wife used to say,
"A beer and a burger.

705
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,067
Those are the two keys
to paradise."

706
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:30,769
It's funny the things you keep...

707
00:47:30,802 --> 00:47:33,538
You carry with you,
isn't it?

708
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:36,075
Yeah.

709
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:38,943
Nine months living
in that hell hole,

710
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:42,748
with the fantasy of finding
that woman again.

711
00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:48,653
Nine months to break away
from those fucking parasites.

712
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:51,824
And I... And that nightmare.

713
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:53,992
And when I did find...

714
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:00,199
I didn't find her, did I?

715
00:48:01,766 --> 00:48:03,134
It's fucking dead.

716
00:48:03,168 --> 00:48:04,637
It wasn't her.

717
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,572
What I saw there
wasn't my Katherine.

718
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,181
Those fucking pieces of her.

719
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:20,786
No!

720
00:48:24,021 --> 00:48:25,690
Her head.

721
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:28,092
Leg.

722
00:48:30,929 --> 00:48:32,565
Those feet.

723
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:38,003
They always tell us how lucky
we are to escape with our lives.

724
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:46,244
I'm not sure
I agree with it.

725
00:48:46,277 --> 00:48:48,113
Sir?

726
00:48:50,114 --> 00:48:52,517
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

727
00:48:59,791 --> 00:49:01,827
What do you know
about the wing commander?

728
00:49:03,195 --> 00:49:05,564
He's solid.

729
00:49:05,597 --> 00:49:06,832
I heard you challenged him.

730
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:08,200
What was that about?

731
00:49:09,134 --> 00:49:10,769
For real.

732
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:16,875
I don't trust him.

733
00:49:17,775 --> 00:49:19,043
Stop looking for fights.

734
00:49:19,077 --> 00:49:20,813
That's a hell of a thing
to say to me.

735
00:49:20,846 --> 00:49:23,215
Hey, Hayes, look.
He's on our side, okay?

736
00:49:23,248 --> 00:49:25,617
He's a brilliant tactician. He...

737
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:31,824
There's some anesthetic
in the kit.

738
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:34,626
Let me know if you need
anything else.

739
00:50:55,407 --> 00:50:57,109
Hey, Gary?

740
00:50:59,043 --> 00:51:00,278
You think they'd
like chocolate?

741
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:03,949
Chocolate.

742
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:06,018
Chocolate.

743
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,052
Roasted in ground
coco seeds.

744
00:51:08,085 --> 00:51:10,088
Typically sweetened and eaten.

745
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:13,326
I would think so.

746
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:19,865
Abraham would shoot me
if he saw me doing this.

747
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:23,135
Okay. Okay. Wait your turn.

748
00:51:23,168 --> 00:51:24,803
As long as they don't eat me.

749
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:26,971
They probably won't.
They seem to like it.

750
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:28,773
Probably?

751
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:30,908
Well, no one here but us.

752
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:32,710
We'll be hard
to track here.

753
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:34,913
I think I'm going
to call this one Cadbury.

754
00:51:34,945 --> 00:51:36,748
No, kid. First you name them,
then you buy them.

755
00:51:36,782 --> 00:51:38,350
And I'm not living
with those things

756
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:39,751
any longer than I have to.

757
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:41,987
They did save you,
Matthew.

758
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,255
I had him.

759
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:44,856
Oh, sure, you did.

760
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:47,158
Make yourself useful.

761
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:52,030
Baked beans for you and me,
and whatever that is for you.

762
00:51:52,063 --> 00:51:56,134
This is a mixture of Xandos
and Zracion minerals.

763
00:51:56,168 --> 00:51:57,903
Pravicor and Yalsa.

764
00:51:57,936 --> 00:52:00,306
Sounds like laxatives
and boner pills.

765
00:52:01,972 --> 00:52:03,108
Boner pills?

766
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:04,343
Just give it a rest,
will you?

767
00:52:04,376 --> 00:52:06,144
Hey.

768
00:52:07,278 --> 00:52:08,981
The dictionary.

769
00:52:09,014 --> 00:52:10,949
I have tried to learn
your language.

770
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:13,918
Do you even know
a single word of mine?

771
00:52:16,054 --> 00:52:17,956
Amelia gave it to me.

772
00:52:17,989 --> 00:52:21,293
Hey, I don't give a shit about
your language or your kind.

773
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:23,695
I care about humans.

774
00:52:23,728 --> 00:52:25,431
The people behind me,
I protect.

775
00:52:25,463 --> 00:52:28,701
The ones beside me,
I respect them.

776
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:32,003
The ones who get
in front of me?

777
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:34,038
Well, you just need
to figure out

778
00:52:34,072 --> 00:52:36,208
where you fit into
that little circle of life.

779
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:45,851
Now what?

780
00:52:47,385 --> 00:52:48,821
Zylik.

781
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:50,989
Zylik? Great.

782
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:52,123
What's a Zylik?

783
00:52:52,157 --> 00:52:54,159
Apex predator.

784
00:52:54,192 --> 00:52:55,960
Why would you bring
an apex predator here?

785
00:52:55,994 --> 00:52:57,762
We brought everything
we had left.

786
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:59,163
Idiot.

787
00:52:59,197 --> 00:53:01,400
And what do
these things eat?

788
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:04,302
Vox. Their favorite.

789
00:53:04,335 --> 00:53:07,238
That's good.
That's just great.

790
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,474
No, it's a bad situation,
Matthew.

791
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:26,826
Holy shit!

792
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:33,765
Go!

793
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:44,108
Go! Go!

794
00:54:11,268 --> 00:54:12,804
Come on!

795
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:19,010
Shit.

796
00:54:20,211 --> 00:54:22,248
Marcus, take cover.

797
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:29,822
- It's going to pick them off.
- Together!

798
00:54:33,525 --> 00:54:35,894
Go to Marcus! Now!

799
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,496
No!

800
00:56:57,235 --> 00:57:00,271
Hey, wake up, buddy.
Come on. Marcus!

801
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,088
Matt!

802
00:57:17,755 --> 00:57:19,524
Son of a bitch.

803
00:57:29,367 --> 00:57:31,403
I don't think
she's going to know anything.

804
00:57:31,436 --> 00:57:33,005
So where are
all the Greys?

805
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:34,606
I haven't seen
any of them.

806
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:36,407
There's one way
to find out.

807
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,980
- Hey.
- Hi.

808
00:57:43,648 --> 00:57:45,384
I'm sorry.

809
00:57:45,416 --> 00:57:47,052
You still owe me dinner.

810
00:57:47,751 --> 00:57:50,121
- Hey.
- Amelia.

811
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:53,091
What do I owe
the pleasure?

812
00:57:53,123 --> 00:57:55,793
We need to know
about the wing commander.

813
00:57:55,827 --> 00:57:57,162
What about him?

814
00:57:57,195 --> 00:57:58,597
He's a highly decorated pilot.

815
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,298
I haven't seen
or been allowed to access

816
00:58:00,331 --> 00:58:02,434
to any of the Greys
that came with us.

817
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:05,304
I've got a feeling
about him.

818
00:58:06,704 --> 00:58:08,472
Do you want to know
my feeling?

819
00:58:08,505 --> 00:58:11,710
The Greys attacked our flying
school on the first night.

820
00:58:11,742 --> 00:58:14,045
Mom, Dad, dog.

821
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,381
Gone.

822
00:58:16,414 --> 00:58:18,682
My family's been flying
for 40 years.

823
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:21,420
When Hayes found me, he managed
to get me back in a cockpit.

824
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:24,623
He's about as much of a parent
as any of us have left here.

825
00:58:24,655 --> 00:58:27,558
And he's helping us
take the fight back.

826
00:58:27,592 --> 00:58:30,528
You know, not everyone's
on this crusade for peace.

827
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:33,599
I know.

828
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:36,568
Better be careful
who your friends are.

829
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:38,336
Babe...

830
00:58:39,304 --> 00:58:40,505
Robin?

831
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:42,373
Now what?

832
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,281
Are you sure
about this?

833
00:58:50,315 --> 00:58:52,217
They're hiding something.

834
00:58:53,717 --> 00:58:55,286
Just so you know,

835
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,588
I feel pretty shitty
about stealing from my girl.

836
00:58:57,621 --> 00:58:59,557
There's no turning back
after this.

837
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:01,358
I hope I'm wrong.

838
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:04,128
But I need to be sure.

839
00:59:05,663 --> 00:59:07,264
- Hey.
- G'day.

840
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,766
Hey, you can't
be here, sir. Halt.

841
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,735
- Hey!
- Turn around. Stand still.

842
00:59:10,768 --> 00:59:12,304
- Don't shoot.
- State your business.

843
00:59:12,336 --> 00:59:14,105
This is a restricted zone.
Why...?

844
00:59:19,409 --> 00:59:21,413
Where are you
supposed to be, sir?

845
00:59:21,445 --> 00:59:23,280
Hang on, hang on,
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

846
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:25,182
- Block H.
- I can smell the burning.

847
00:59:25,215 --> 00:59:26,784
H, right, okay.
All the way to the end, sir.

848
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:29,621
You turn left, you turn right,
to the blue doors.

849
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:31,655
- Blue doors? Blue doors?
- Blue doors.

850
00:59:31,688 --> 00:59:33,724
This is a restricted zone, sir.
Do not touch me.

851
00:59:33,757 --> 00:59:35,426
- I am not... Move.
- How much do you lift?

852
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,894
Right, move. Move!

853
00:59:36,927 --> 00:59:38,630
Let's get out of here.

854
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:10,795
I should ride ahead.

855
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:12,730
Tell Jacob.

856
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:14,900
He'll understand.

857
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:16,835
I doubt it.

858
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,743
Do you trust these humans?

859
01:00:26,677 --> 01:00:28,313
With my life.

860
01:00:28,346 --> 01:00:30,782
Pete and Bella fought with me
from the start.

861
01:00:33,483 --> 01:00:35,252
It's funny how your Kali mates
keep showing up.

862
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:39,291
I do not find it amusing.

863
01:00:39,324 --> 01:00:41,592
One of the Greys at HQ must be
giving away our position.

864
01:00:41,626 --> 01:00:43,528
A friend of yours, maybe?

865
01:00:43,561 --> 01:00:45,829
Do you really think
it was one of my kind?

866
01:00:45,862 --> 01:00:49,167
I've seen many humans
making deals.

867
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:52,336
I've seen you fight.

868
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:55,574
You're keeping something
from me.

869
01:00:55,606 --> 01:00:57,309
I am a soldier, Matthew.

870
01:00:58,443 --> 01:01:00,278
Just like you.

871
01:01:17,427 --> 01:01:19,463
Rainfall. Serango.

872
01:01:19,496 --> 01:01:22,333
So here we are now.
A secret mission.

873
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:23,768
A secret mission?

874
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,569
What kind of secret mission?

875
01:01:25,603 --> 01:01:27,838
Peter? Don't even
think about it.

876
01:01:32,309 --> 01:01:33,679
So, what's your story?

877
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,451
I am assisting Matthew
on our mission.

878
01:01:39,483 --> 01:01:40,719
Mm-hmm.

879
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:42,353
I have heard a lot
about you.

880
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,356
From who?

881
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:47,625
Amelia, the human.

882
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:49,494
Oh.

883
01:01:49,527 --> 01:01:51,262
So that's what
she goes by now?

884
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:53,431
How is she?

885
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:01,672
Ah.

886
01:02:04,842 --> 01:02:07,445
You guys have got a good
setup here.

887
01:02:07,478 --> 01:02:09,347
We just wanted to get
as far away from the...

888
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,516
From the fighting
as we could.

889
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:14,653
Pretty soon,
others joined us.

890
01:02:14,686 --> 01:02:16,021
Now we've got a village.

891
01:02:16,054 --> 01:02:17,922
Speaking of which.

892
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:23,961
Out of respect
for our neighbors...

893
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:26,297
You get your weapons back
when you leave.

894
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:32,804
Thank you.

895
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:51,356
We must leave soon,
Matthew.

896
01:02:51,389 --> 01:02:53,391
The Kali are on our tail.

897
01:02:53,423 --> 01:02:55,360
They won't give up.

898
01:02:55,393 --> 01:02:57,762
We're pretty invisible to their
sensors. There's no rush.

899
01:02:57,795 --> 01:02:59,563
See? Relax, Gary.

900
01:02:59,597 --> 01:03:01,633
- Gary?
- That is not my name.

901
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:03,001
- It is...
- Gary...

902
01:03:03,034 --> 01:03:05,369
don't be rude to the host.

903
01:03:05,402 --> 01:03:07,638
I've seen what Pete does
to Greys when he gets mad.

904
01:03:24,088 --> 01:03:25,757
Am I dead?

905
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:27,826
Not yet.

906
01:03:28,726 --> 01:03:30,061
Dad and I found you guys.

907
01:03:30,094 --> 01:03:31,896
This is weird.
It's...

908
01:03:31,929 --> 01:03:34,499
It's been, like, over a year
since I've seen you.

909
01:03:34,532 --> 01:03:37,869
You guys are fighting monsters.
I'm fighting for food.

910
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:39,604
Yeah, I get it.

911
01:03:39,637 --> 01:03:41,106
I've been in the Sydney siege
this whole time.

912
01:03:41,139 --> 01:03:43,108
Yeah.

913
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:44,776
I want to hear about it.

914
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:46,978
I better go check the traps.
Come on.

915
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,047
Hey!

916
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,748
Let's go.

917
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,557
<i>Attention, attention...</i>

918
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,662
<i>Attention, attention...</i>

919
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:45,169
Dennis? Dennis, you hear me?

920
01:04:45,202 --> 01:04:47,471
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

921
01:04:47,505 --> 01:04:49,039
They have the old
alien bioweapon here.

922
01:04:49,072 --> 01:04:50,908
The one that Matt
and Jackson took.

923
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:53,043
- <i>Why?</i>
- I don't know.

924
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:55,646
Just go get Abraham.

925
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:57,614
Shit.

926
01:04:57,648 --> 01:05:00,785
Hey, there's nothing in there.
What are you doing?

927
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:02,554
Get out of there.

928
01:05:02,586 --> 01:05:04,121
Open the door.
Get out of here.

929
01:05:04,155 --> 01:05:05,990
- Get out.
- Get out of here.

930
01:05:06,923 --> 01:05:08,492
<i>Amelia? Amelia!</i>

931
01:06:01,612 --> 01:06:03,748
Amelia told me what you did

932
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:07,117
when you took
one of my kind prisoner.

933
01:06:16,693 --> 01:06:18,230
Yeah.

934
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:23,000
I bashed its head in.

935
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:29,007
Oh, my...

936
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,876
It was a dark time
for all of us.

937
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,713
<i>I'm not proud of what I did.</i>

938
01:06:36,746 --> 01:06:39,317
It was a dark time.

939
01:06:39,349 --> 01:06:43,020
The light was Amelia.

940
01:06:43,054 --> 01:06:44,689
Oh!

941
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:56,099
She spared your life.

942
01:06:56,132 --> 01:06:57,234
No.

943
01:06:57,268 --> 01:07:00,204
She forgave me.

944
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:07,579
- Amelia!
- Amelia!

945
01:07:07,612 --> 01:07:09,314
Hey! Hi!

946
01:07:09,347 --> 01:07:11,182
I'm going to get you
out of here, okay?

947
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:13,050
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- There she is.

948
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,618
Someone's coming.

949
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:19,691
Bitch!

950
01:07:26,764 --> 01:07:28,800
Move! Move!

951
01:07:56,694 --> 01:07:58,663
So it's all gone
to shit.

952
01:07:58,695 --> 01:08:00,331
Amelia.

953
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:02,032
This war.

954
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,304
I don't even know
what I'm fighting for.

955
01:08:07,404 --> 01:08:08,706
What happened to you, man?

956
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,143
The Greys wanted
to sit down with Amelia

957
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:14,811
and talk about some
sort of truce.

958
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:16,814
It stank.

959
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:20,018
I don't want to do it but, hey,
she's building an alliance.

960
01:08:20,051 --> 01:08:21,620
Right?

961
01:08:22,853 --> 01:08:24,221
We're sitting around a table,

962
01:08:24,255 --> 01:08:26,891
and in walks
this little alien kid.

963
01:08:26,923 --> 01:08:30,060
He's just carrying this little
basket of plastic flowers.

964
01:08:33,863 --> 01:08:37,201
The bastards didn't even wait
till she left the room.

965
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:40,371
One of their own.

966
01:08:40,404 --> 01:08:42,407
I was between Amelia
and the blast.

967
01:08:43,841 --> 01:08:45,243
That's why I look like
that candle.

968
01:08:47,144 --> 01:08:49,313
It's a slight improvement.

969
01:08:50,914 --> 01:08:53,016
Some high-tech shit,

970
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,819
designed for maximum damage.

971
01:08:56,252 --> 01:08:58,856
The next day she's out there
asking what we did wrong.

972
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,112
What's going on here?

973
01:09:24,914 --> 01:09:26,917
We're here for the alien, Peter.

974
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,920
- String him up!
- Yeah!

975
01:09:32,989 --> 01:09:34,391
You can't have him, Jacob.

976
01:09:34,425 --> 01:09:37,462
You're sheltering
the enemy.

977
01:09:37,494 --> 01:09:38,962
You know the rules.

978
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:40,965
We wrote the rules
together, man.

979
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:43,934
He's a member of the Resistance,
on a sanction mission.

980
01:09:43,967 --> 01:09:47,137
Just give him over to us,
then we'll let you be.

981
01:09:47,171 --> 01:09:49,106
Cadbury!

982
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:53,110
The Voxes, they need me!

983
01:09:59,015 --> 01:10:01,418
Get back. Stop it. Go.

984
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,256
They mean nothing to you!
Go away!

985
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,158
Bring him out!

986
01:10:13,363 --> 01:10:15,866
Bring that maggot
out here now!

987
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:18,469
You can't have him, okay?
You can't have him!

988
01:10:18,502 --> 01:10:20,171
He's a guest in my home!

989
01:10:20,203 --> 01:10:23,373
Now go home, all of youse!
Go home!

990
01:10:23,407 --> 01:10:27,177
- No way.
- I'm sorry, Peter.

991
01:10:27,211 --> 01:10:28,780
But you leave us
with no choice.

992
01:10:28,813 --> 01:10:31,047
Face us, you ugly maggot!

993
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:34,152
Treat Peter's family and home
with respect.

994
01:10:34,185 --> 01:10:35,820
Let's get him!

995
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:38,322
But get in there
and get that maggot!

996
01:10:38,354 --> 01:10:40,090
- Go!
- Yeah!

997
01:10:45,362 --> 01:10:47,398
Do not come near this house!

998
01:10:50,266 --> 01:10:53,938
Your fight is not between
these humans.

999
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:57,073
It is with me.

1000
01:10:57,106 --> 01:10:59,577
Get back! Get me some room...

1001
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:02,514
- Go away!
- Marcus, stay here.

1002
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:06,184
Are you guys okay?

1003
01:11:06,216 --> 01:11:09,119
I do not want bloodshed.

1004
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:12,123
But if it's me you want...

1005
01:11:13,457 --> 01:11:15,293
...come get some.

1006
01:11:18,395 --> 01:11:20,565
Come and try.

1007
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:29,140
Take him! Go!

1008
01:11:37,914 --> 01:11:39,317
Get him! Get in there! Come on!

1009
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,886
No!

1010
01:11:41,918 --> 01:11:44,087
Get him!

1011
01:11:44,954 --> 01:11:47,358
Get him! Kill him!

1012
01:12:01,971 --> 01:12:03,307
Leave him be!

1013
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,278
Leave him!

1014
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:15,453
Let him go. Now.

1015
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,389
The next person who even looks
at the Grey wrong eats a bullet.

1016
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:20,992
How about that?

1017
01:12:21,024 --> 01:12:22,425
We're taking
the Grey away, okay?

1018
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,194
You won't see
either of them again.

1019
01:12:24,228 --> 01:12:26,029
I give you my word.

1020
01:12:27,398 --> 01:12:29,967
I ever see him again,

1021
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,969
- it's dead.
- Never again!

1022
01:12:32,002 --> 01:12:34,572
You won't see him again, okay?

1023
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:37,875
But when I return, you and I are
going to have a few words.

1024
01:12:39,475 --> 01:12:42,078
Now, go on. Get!

1025
01:12:42,112 --> 01:12:43,514
Go home.

1026
01:12:43,546 --> 01:12:46,183
Let's go! Let's go!

1027
01:12:51,521 --> 01:12:53,157
You're going to need help.

1028
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:55,659
I'm going to make sure
you complete your mission.

1029
01:12:57,027 --> 01:12:58,628
I've hidden from this war
long enough.

1030
01:12:58,662 --> 01:13:01,099
We've hidden long enough.

1031
01:13:02,231 --> 01:13:04,502
You need help,
call the cavalry.

1032
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:08,038
You are full of surprises.

1033
01:13:08,072 --> 01:13:10,007
Don't read into it.
I'm still drunk.

1034
01:13:15,112 --> 01:13:16,547
You okay, Gary?

1035
01:13:20,484 --> 01:13:22,353
You got balls, man.

1036
01:13:23,252 --> 01:13:24,988
You know what I mean?

1037
01:13:25,689 --> 01:13:27,325
Go on in.

1038
01:13:44,707 --> 01:13:46,710
Get this into your head.

1039
01:13:47,578 --> 01:13:49,714
War is a messy

1040
01:13:49,747 --> 01:13:51,315
and profoundly
savage business.

1041
01:13:51,347 --> 01:13:54,118
There is no magical
diplomatic solution.

1042
01:13:55,752 --> 01:13:57,520
You're fucked, Hayes.

1043
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:00,658
I've seen everything.

1044
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,726
Why don't you take her down
to the lower levels.

1045
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,563
Lock her up.
We don't need her here.

1046
01:14:05,595 --> 01:14:07,197
Well, we do.

1047
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:09,734
- Abe!
- Abe.

1048
01:14:09,766 --> 01:14:11,434
You might want
to get control of your kids.

1049
01:14:11,467 --> 01:14:13,371
They're killing
all the Greys downstairs.

1050
01:14:13,404 --> 01:14:15,473
Torturing.
Experimenting.

1051
01:14:15,506 --> 01:14:17,307
Hundreds of them.

1052
01:14:17,341 --> 01:14:18,710
He's a monster.

1053
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,149
Charles?

1054
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:27,385
You want to
explain yourself?

1055
01:14:28,252 --> 01:14:30,087
Why not?

1056
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:32,489
The Greys have every last
tactical and material advantage.

1057
01:14:32,523 --> 01:14:34,557
Geneva's out
the fucking window.

1058
01:14:34,591 --> 01:14:36,394
If I have to sacrifice
a few of the bastards

1059
01:14:36,426 --> 01:14:38,194
just to find a weakness,
then so be it.

1060
01:14:38,228 --> 01:14:40,163
Mate, you're talking
mass murder.

1061
01:14:40,197 --> 01:14:44,368
You have no idea what a reverse
alien bioweapon will do.

1062
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,404
It's called
a tactical advantage.

1063
01:14:47,438 --> 01:14:50,507
A tactical advantage.

1064
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,076
Now you listen to me.

1065
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:55,046
All of you,
listen to me.

1066
01:14:56,814 --> 01:14:59,450
When our world ended, yeah,
so did a lot of hope.

1067
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:01,652
I understand that, Charles.

1068
01:15:02,519 --> 01:15:04,155
But our story, our...

1069
01:15:04,188 --> 01:15:07,591
Our greatest story
as a species

1070
01:15:07,623 --> 01:15:09,626
is not all the times
that we fall,

1071
01:15:09,659 --> 01:15:13,730
but that we rise again
every single time.

1072
01:15:13,764 --> 01:15:15,666
Please, Charles.

1073
01:15:15,698 --> 01:15:19,536
Let's... Let's not let
a rash decision

1074
01:15:19,569 --> 01:15:22,606
cost us the opportunity
to do that.

1075
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:25,209
But it's too late, Abe.

1076
01:15:25,242 --> 01:15:26,811
Mate, why?

1077
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:29,246
Because they tracked us
from Sydney.

1078
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:31,415
The command ships
are inbound as we speak.

1079
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:34,218
We are now officially
on the offensive.

1080
01:15:34,251 --> 01:15:37,121
It won't distinguish
between friend or foe.

1081
01:15:37,154 --> 01:15:40,191
It'll wipe out all the Greys.
You're talking about extinction.

1082
01:15:40,224 --> 01:15:42,560
What makes you think any of them
are worthy of our trust?

1083
01:15:42,592 --> 01:15:44,795
Abe, the Greys
in the Resistance,

1084
01:15:44,828 --> 01:15:46,230
the help they've done.

1085
01:15:46,262 --> 01:15:48,099
- Abe...
- Gary...

1086
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:49,766
- ...don't be fooled by these people.
- ...Vidargh.

1087
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,302
They were nothing before this,
they're nothing now.

1088
01:15:52,336 --> 01:15:53,570
They're not like you and me.

1089
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:55,172
- Charles.
- Yeah?

1090
01:15:55,204 --> 01:15:56,806
You're a good man.
A good man.

1091
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,177
But it doesn't have
to go this way.

1092
01:16:00,844 --> 01:16:02,346
There's always a choice.

1093
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,850
You're right.

1094
01:16:06,716 --> 01:16:08,786
So who's with me?

1095
01:16:10,154 --> 01:16:11,789
Dennis, help me.

1096
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:17,894
No. Not like this.

1097
01:16:17,927 --> 01:16:19,630
Not like what?

1098
01:16:19,662 --> 01:16:21,131
Wing Commander Hayes,

1099
01:16:21,164 --> 01:16:22,867
I'm relieving you
of your command.

1100
01:16:25,868 --> 01:16:28,438
Don't do it.

1101
01:16:28,471 --> 01:16:30,273
This is bloody
ridiculous.

1102
01:16:30,306 --> 01:16:32,775
You're not the authority here,
old man.

1103
01:16:32,809 --> 01:16:34,445
The enemy is out there.

1104
01:16:34,478 --> 01:16:37,648
And like it or not,
this weapon is the answer.

1105
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,784
Captain Bailey, will you relieve
the Commander of his sidearm?

1106
01:16:42,552 --> 01:16:44,188
Put your weapon down.
Stand down.

1107
01:16:48,425 --> 01:16:50,494
Is this a bad time?

1108
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,163
Captain Wessex.

1109
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:53,530
Stand down.

1110
01:16:53,564 --> 01:16:54,832
You disarm these people
or open fire.

1111
01:16:54,864 --> 01:16:56,533
- Captain Bailey.
- Wessex.

1112
01:16:56,567 --> 01:16:58,668
- Wessex.
- He's about to commit genocide.

1113
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,436
You have no idea
what's required to fight.

1114
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:02,606
Remove the commander's
sidearm now!

1115
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:04,675
This is a fucking war,
and we are losing.

1116
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:07,710
Do you understand me?
We are fucking losing here.

1117
01:17:07,743 --> 01:17:09,212
Now, Captain Wessex.

1118
01:17:09,246 --> 01:17:11,448
You are a soldier.
Do your duty.

1119
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,417
- You know me. This isn't right.
- Captain Wessex.

1120
01:17:19,323 --> 01:17:21,225
Wing Commander Hayes...

1121
01:17:22,826 --> 01:17:24,328
your weapon, sir.

1122
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,863
You are relieved.
Lock it down.

1123
01:17:25,895 --> 01:17:27,463
On the ground! Face down!

1124
01:17:27,497 --> 01:17:29,466
Get down.
Down on the ground.

1125
01:17:29,498 --> 01:17:30,867
Down on the ground, I said!

1126
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:32,836
Yeah, on your knees.

1127
01:17:32,868 --> 01:17:34,771
Hands behind your back.

1128
01:17:34,805 --> 01:17:36,507
Take down.

1129
01:17:38,274 --> 01:17:39,542
Right, stay down.

1130
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:40,978
It's the command ships.

1131
01:17:41,011 --> 01:17:43,214
They're here.

1132
01:17:56,859 --> 01:17:59,496
Fall back! Fall back!

1133
01:18:14,011 --> 01:18:15,546
It's been hit, all right.

1134
01:18:15,578 --> 01:18:17,447
But not recently.

1135
01:18:18,347 --> 01:18:19,817
First wave, maybe?

1136
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:22,419
No signs of life.

1137
01:18:22,452 --> 01:18:23,854
Must have beaten
the Kali here.

1138
01:18:25,421 --> 01:18:27,257
They won't stop tracking us.

1139
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:28,859
They never give up.

1140
01:18:31,862 --> 01:18:33,998
Either way, we go in.

1141
01:19:27,117 --> 01:19:29,552
Houston, we have a problem.

1142
01:19:33,823 --> 01:19:35,725
Come on, come on.

1143
01:19:35,759 --> 01:19:38,662
Help me, Drinkie Wan.
You're my only hope.

1144
01:19:38,694 --> 01:19:40,831
I need a drink.

1145
01:19:40,863 --> 01:19:43,701
Open the fridge bay doors, Hal.

1146
01:19:43,734 --> 01:19:45,369
Open the fridge bay doors.

1147
01:19:45,402 --> 01:19:46,869
Tear open that fridge,
Mr. Gorbachev.

1148
01:19:48,637 --> 01:19:50,740
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

1149
01:19:50,774 --> 01:19:52,743
You can't handle your drink.

1150
01:19:52,775 --> 01:19:56,079
Thank you very much.
Booyah! 'Cause there it is.

1151
01:19:56,113 --> 01:19:57,681
Oh.

1152
01:19:57,713 --> 01:19:59,983
- Hi?
- What the fuck?

1153
01:20:00,015 --> 01:20:02,452
Why do you keep yelling "booyah"?

1154
01:20:02,485 --> 01:20:04,354
You think you're killing it,
but you're not.

1155
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:06,122
You're better off...

1156
01:20:06,155 --> 01:20:08,425
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

1157
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:12,395
Okay, we come in peace.
We don't want any trouble.

1158
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:15,065
- Who are you?
- Huh?

1159
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,001
I should ask you
the same question.

1160
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:19,737
Who are you?

1161
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,438
I asked you first.

1162
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:22,872
Good point.

1163
01:20:22,905 --> 01:20:25,943
Well, my name is Bud Miller,

1164
01:20:25,975 --> 01:20:27,610
and we're cooperating.

1165
01:20:27,644 --> 01:20:31,148
And this is Steven.

1166
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:33,384
Hi. Steve.

1167
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,652
I'm not sure
if I am cooperating.

1168
01:20:35,685 --> 01:20:37,388
We're cooperating.

1169
01:20:37,421 --> 01:20:38,789
Oh, I'm cooperating.

1170
01:20:38,822 --> 01:20:40,123
Steve is a stupid name.

1171
01:20:40,157 --> 01:20:43,060
- Hey!
- Yeah, stupid, right?

1172
01:20:43,092 --> 01:20:44,595
Whatever you say, Gary.

1173
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:46,462
Gary?

1174
01:20:46,496 --> 01:20:49,867
Okay, Bud, what the hell
are you two doing down here?

1175
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:51,934
- This guy let me out.
- Don't say it like that.

1176
01:20:51,967 --> 01:20:54,003
I was just... You know,
I let him out.

1177
01:20:54,037 --> 01:20:56,106
- So, that's what I said.
- Wait.

1178
01:20:56,139 --> 01:20:58,175
Did one of our guys find you?
Bring you back here?

1179
01:20:58,207 --> 01:20:59,842
- No.
- Nice hat, man.

1180
01:20:59,876 --> 01:21:03,079
I only asked one person
to leave, but no.

1181
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:05,716
All of them left to find help...

1182
01:21:05,748 --> 01:21:07,150
How are you doing, honey? Huh?

1183
01:21:08,717 --> 01:21:09,853
You ever been with an alien?

1184
01:21:09,886 --> 01:21:11,155
- Dude. Dude!
- What?

1185
01:21:11,188 --> 01:21:13,457
I got urges. What can I do?

1186
01:21:13,489 --> 01:21:15,626
Oh, I don't know.
Clean up the site?

1187
01:21:15,658 --> 01:21:16,893
Make it operational?

1188
01:21:16,926 --> 01:21:18,429
Keep it safe,
like I do every day?

1189
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:19,763
- I help.
- How?

1190
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,832
Trash. I take out
the trash.

1191
01:21:21,864 --> 01:21:24,667
Yeah, yeah, you dump it in a
missile silo, like 30 feet deep.

1192
01:21:24,701 --> 01:21:26,502
What about these?
I made these, didn't I?

1193
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:27,871
You see any aliens here?

1194
01:21:27,904 --> 01:21:29,139
Well, I have an EpiPen.

1195
01:21:29,171 --> 01:21:31,107
Do you see your hives
getting worse?

1196
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,775
What, do my hives matter?

1197
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:34,177
- The hives again?
- It does!

1198
01:21:34,211 --> 01:21:36,079
Because you couldn't
breathe last time.

1199
01:21:36,112 --> 01:21:38,449
- I like scratching, okay?
- You can't eat pistachios.

1200
01:21:38,481 --> 01:21:40,751
- And you know that.
- But I told you why.

1201
01:21:40,783 --> 01:21:43,085
But you keep eating it
over and over again.

1202
01:21:43,118 --> 01:21:45,021
- Because they're delicious!
- Will you just...

1203
01:21:45,055 --> 01:21:46,824
Shut up.

1204
01:21:46,856 --> 01:21:48,692
We didn't come all this way

1205
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:50,594
to hear you two
bitch at each other.

1206
01:21:50,627 --> 01:21:52,663
- Absolutely right.
- God, I'm sorry.

1207
01:21:52,695 --> 01:21:54,698
Why are you whispering?
Everybody can hear you.

1208
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:56,766
I've been dealing
with this shit for two years.

1209
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,101
Blow his brains out.
Blow his brains out.

1210
01:21:59,135 --> 01:22:01,637
If that doesn't work,
blow my brains out.

1211
01:22:01,671 --> 01:22:03,974
No, do that.
That's a good idea.

1212
01:22:04,841 --> 01:22:05,976
Rainfall?

1213
01:22:06,009 --> 01:22:07,211
That's what the intel said.

1214
01:22:07,243 --> 01:22:08,911
Code name: Rainfall.

1215
01:22:08,944 --> 01:22:10,480
Where are you taking us?

1216
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:12,149
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm going to the restroom.

1217
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:13,550
You all just followed me.

1218
01:22:13,582 --> 01:22:15,585
No, that's this place.

1219
01:22:15,618 --> 01:22:17,621
Pine Gap: Rainfall.

1220
01:22:17,654 --> 01:22:19,022
You need to be
more specific.

1221
01:22:19,055 --> 01:22:21,525
That's the only information
we have.

1222
01:22:21,557 --> 01:22:22,893
Hey, Gary?

1223
01:22:24,594 --> 01:22:25,863
There can be only one.

1224
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:29,099
Am I as annoying as he is?

1225
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:30,701
You ever see a movie, Gary?

1226
01:22:30,734 --> 01:22:33,036
Surely you must
know something about why

1227
01:22:33,069 --> 01:22:34,838
they're interested
in this place.

1228
01:22:34,871 --> 01:22:36,707
You're the bloody
U.S. government.

1229
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:38,908
There is no
U.S. government anymore.

1230
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:40,210
I'm just one guy.

1231
01:22:40,243 --> 01:22:41,745
What about him?

1232
01:22:41,778 --> 01:22:43,046
Maybe it's him
they're after.

1233
01:22:43,078 --> 01:22:45,014
Okay, put that down.
Seriously.

1234
01:22:45,047 --> 01:22:46,949
You don't know what that...
Seriously?

1235
01:22:46,983 --> 01:22:49,653
Moving forward,
don't touch anything.

1236
01:22:49,685 --> 01:22:52,121
This could blow up on contact.

1237
01:22:52,154 --> 01:22:54,925
Oh, this is Steven's
night-light,

1238
01:22:54,957 --> 01:22:56,559
so you can totally hold it.

1239
01:22:56,592 --> 01:22:59,028
Look, I doubt anyone
would be after Steven.

1240
01:22:59,061 --> 01:23:01,899
I mean, look at him.
He's a moron, all right?

1241
01:23:01,931 --> 01:23:04,568
He's a scout who crashed here
decades ago.

1242
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,603
So Roswell didn't want him.

1243
01:23:06,636 --> 01:23:10,908
So there is nothing at this
facility at all that you need.

1244
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:13,809
Okay. Follow me.

1245
01:23:13,842 --> 01:23:16,246
Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

1246
01:23:16,279 --> 01:23:17,714
Sorry.

1247
01:23:17,747 --> 01:23:19,615
Catch a movie, Gary.

1248
01:23:19,649 --> 01:23:22,085
Ooh, Bud gets busted.

1249
01:23:22,118 --> 01:23:23,954
Shut up, Steven.

1250
01:23:23,987 --> 01:23:25,221
It's Steve.

1251
01:23:25,255 --> 01:23:26,957
Take off that
ridiculous moustache.

1252
01:23:26,989 --> 01:23:28,125
I grew it.

1253
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:29,593
- Idiot!
- Ow!

1254
01:23:29,626 --> 01:23:31,729
Oh, that's so unkind.

1255
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:37,000
All pilots to your planes.

1256
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:39,303
Right, we need to hold them off
as long as we can, people!

1257
01:23:39,336 --> 01:23:41,771
Dennis, start loading people
onto the trucks.

1258
01:23:41,805 --> 01:23:44,240
- I'm on it.
- You're making a big fucking mistake there, Abe.

1259
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:46,643
You have no fucking idea
what you're doing.

1260
01:23:46,676 --> 01:23:48,912
Return to your posts!
Do your duty!

1261
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:50,613
Soldiers, goddamn it.

1262
01:23:50,646 --> 01:23:52,615
<i>Multiple one and two injuries.</i>

1263
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:54,318
What the fuck do you want?

1264
01:23:55,719 --> 01:23:57,954
No one's listening
to you anymore, Hayes.

1265
01:23:57,988 --> 01:23:59,690
Yeah, well, they will be
when they realize

1266
01:23:59,722 --> 01:24:01,190
you just lost them this war.

1267
01:24:01,224 --> 01:24:02,726
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1268
01:24:02,759 --> 01:24:05,296
We'll see what history
has to say.

1269
01:24:07,063 --> 01:24:09,333
Foxhound, do you copy?

1270
01:24:09,365 --> 01:24:12,336
Zorro Flight, do you copy?

1271
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:14,737
Can't get hold of any pilots.

1272
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,305
You were saying, Miss Chambers?

1273
01:24:16,338 --> 01:24:18,908
System's down.
Aliens have taken over.

1274
01:24:22,212 --> 01:24:24,681
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

1275
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:29,152
<i>We will spare your lives</i>

1276
01:24:29,185 --> 01:24:33,057
<i>if you send out
Amelia the human to face us.</i>

1277
01:24:34,224 --> 01:24:37,094
<i>Comply, or die.</i>

1278
01:24:40,697 --> 01:24:42,099
Amelia...

1279
01:24:42,131 --> 01:24:44,000
you don't have to.

1280
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:46,937
I do.

1281
01:24:48,203 --> 01:24:50,206
<i>Attention, attention...</i>

1282
01:25:01,283 --> 01:25:03,086
Wait.

1283
01:25:13,863 --> 01:25:15,365
You're crazy.

1284
01:25:19,002 --> 01:25:20,404
- Come on! Move it!
- Go! Go!

1285
01:25:20,436 --> 01:25:23,439
Move! Move! Move!

1286
01:25:23,472 --> 01:25:25,408
Open up! Go! Go! Go!

1287
01:25:25,442 --> 01:25:28,712
Move! Hold the line!

1288
01:25:28,744 --> 01:25:31,681
Come on, move it! Get in!

1289
01:25:31,715 --> 01:25:33,449
You're in the jump,
Private.

1290
01:25:33,483 --> 01:25:36,286
- Get down!
- Hold the line!

1291
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:50,867
Receiving.

1292
01:25:50,899 --> 01:25:52,301
Copy, Wessex.

1293
01:26:28,938 --> 01:26:31,041
Look, Amelia,
you got this.

1294
01:26:39,015 --> 01:26:41,885
I'm starting to feel
like General Custer here, guys.

1295
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:44,086
- <i>Are you getting this?</i>
- Copy, Wessex.

1296
01:26:44,119 --> 01:26:46,389
We see it.

1297
01:26:46,421 --> 01:26:48,391
Sit tight.

1298
01:26:55,230 --> 01:26:57,201
Good work, Edmond.

1299
01:27:24,027 --> 01:27:25,429
Well?

1300
01:27:46,181 --> 01:27:48,385
Amelia the human.

1301
01:27:48,417 --> 01:27:52,822
You are courageous to come out
from behind your fortifications.

1302
01:27:52,855 --> 01:27:56,425
You show yourself a worthy
leader of your people.

1303
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:57,594
I'm not their leader.

1304
01:28:00,063 --> 01:28:03,432
Many of my kind
betrayed their own in your name.

1305
01:28:03,466 --> 01:28:05,368
I came here hoping to negotiate.

1306
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,604
I've tried once before.

1307
01:28:07,636 --> 01:28:10,206
Our kind had lost hope.

1308
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,175
Our world had ended.

1309
01:28:12,207 --> 01:28:15,612
We brought them here
looking for a new beginning.

1310
01:28:15,645 --> 01:28:17,113
Now many are dead.

1311
01:28:17,145 --> 01:28:19,315
As an elder,
I am responsible.

1312
01:28:19,349 --> 01:28:21,051
I know.

1313
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:23,220
Both our people
have suffered enough.

1314
01:28:26,456 --> 01:28:29,159
And yet, so strong.

1315
01:28:29,192 --> 01:28:31,094
Sacrifices must be made.

1316
01:28:31,127 --> 01:28:34,631
This war must come to an end,
or I will be held accountable.

1317
01:28:34,663 --> 01:28:37,533
If we can't make peace...

1318
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:40,237
there'll be no world to share.

1319
01:28:44,274 --> 01:28:46,009
We can work together.

1320
01:28:47,042 --> 01:28:48,978
I know very well
the atrocities

1321
01:28:49,011 --> 01:28:51,413
that are committed against
my people here,

1322
01:28:51,447 --> 01:28:55,886
where your accomplices
now cower in fear and shame.

1323
01:28:55,918 --> 01:29:00,189
And now, may you be
an example to your people.

1324
01:29:00,222 --> 01:29:01,490
You are their leader.

1325
01:29:06,962 --> 01:29:09,599
- Those bastards.
- Fuck.

1326
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:12,335
Run, Amelia.

1327
01:29:16,005 --> 01:29:17,574
Run!

1328
01:29:17,606 --> 01:29:19,943
Open fire!

1329
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:52,041
Find out where Dennis is
with those transports.

1330
01:29:52,074 --> 01:29:54,077
- Yes, sir.
- Patch me to the squadron leader.

1331
01:29:54,109 --> 01:29:56,378
We need to hold off this attack
until we get evacuated.

1332
01:29:56,412 --> 01:29:58,481
Everybody needs
to switch on now.

1333
01:30:00,382 --> 01:30:01,550
Go, I said.

1334
01:30:01,583 --> 01:30:03,353
You fight with me,

1335
01:30:03,386 --> 01:30:05,655
or you die when these bastards
overrun this place.

1336
01:30:05,688 --> 01:30:07,257
Hey.

1337
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:09,158
I know what they put you
through, okay?

1338
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:11,661
I've been there.

1339
01:30:11,694 --> 01:30:13,096
Don't do this, mate.

1340
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:17,300
Get these mongrels.
They should die like this.

1341
01:30:17,332 --> 01:30:19,368
Put some pressure
on this wound.

1342
01:30:19,402 --> 01:30:21,637
Order to hang all bioweapon
missiles on all ready aircraft.

1343
01:30:21,671 --> 01:30:23,206
You launch when ready.

1344
01:30:23,238 --> 01:30:24,506
I got you. I got you.

1345
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:26,676
Everyone!

1346
01:30:28,744 --> 01:30:30,413
You get back to work.

1347
01:30:38,554 --> 01:30:40,657
<i>Attention.</i>

1348
01:30:40,689 --> 01:30:43,225
<i>All non-combative personnel
not manning stations</i>

1349
01:30:43,259 --> 01:30:44,627
<i>proceed to lower ground.</i>

1350
01:30:47,497 --> 01:30:48,765
We're getting out of here!

1351
01:30:48,797 --> 01:30:51,166
This way, okay?
So stay close.

1352
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:54,470
Keep your families tight.
Go! Go! Go!

1353
01:31:04,713 --> 01:31:07,250
Twenty minutes till breach!

1354
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:18,193
Hey, Bobby,
you got to go.

1355
01:31:18,226 --> 01:31:19,496
Now.

1356
01:31:22,331 --> 01:31:24,266
Abe.

1357
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,302
Hayes has taken control and he's
going to release the bioweapon.

1358
01:31:27,336 --> 01:31:29,806
You think Abraham died
to let that happen?

1359
01:31:29,838 --> 01:31:31,573
Amelia, look at me.

1360
01:31:33,576 --> 01:31:35,244
I'm with you.

1361
01:31:36,244 --> 01:31:37,581
I'm with you.

1362
01:31:38,514 --> 01:31:40,449
Yeah.

1363
01:31:44,854 --> 01:31:46,556
Stop.

1364
01:31:48,824 --> 01:31:51,327
Careful what you wish for.

1365
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,132
I staggered the lights myself.

1366
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:59,469
Step inside my office, boys...

1367
01:31:59,502 --> 01:32:01,671
and the girl.

1368
01:32:01,703 --> 01:32:06,341
What I'm about to show you
is known to only a few people.

1369
01:32:06,375 --> 01:32:09,212
Even less have ever
seen this.

1370
01:32:09,244 --> 01:32:11,247
National security dictates
that classified...

1371
01:32:11,279 --> 01:32:14,117
Oh, my God, will you stop
being so melodramatic?

1372
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:16,518
You boys mind?
We got people waiting on us.

1373
01:32:16,551 --> 01:32:19,322
I'm just trying to convey
the importance of this situa...

1374
01:32:19,354 --> 01:32:21,857
You know what? Forget it.
You don't deserve the speech.

1375
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:24,427
- Steven?
- Huh? Oh, yeah.

1376
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,229
Thank you.

1377
01:32:27,262 --> 01:32:28,765
Uh-huh.

1378
01:32:29,731 --> 01:32:33,302
Okay, and three, two, one.

1379
01:32:34,503 --> 01:32:36,573
- Booyah.
- Nice.

1380
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:00,630
Scientists discovered it

1381
01:33:00,662 --> 01:33:03,699
embedded in the seafloor
in 1966.

1382
01:33:03,733 --> 01:33:05,400
They shipped it here,

1383
01:33:05,434 --> 01:33:07,704
the last place on earth
you'd ever expect.

1384
01:33:07,737 --> 01:33:09,204
Pine Gap.

1385
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:10,874
I don't get it.

1386
01:33:10,907 --> 01:33:13,342
It just looks like
one big rock.

1387
01:33:13,376 --> 01:33:15,512
It's one big asteroid

1388
01:33:15,545 --> 01:33:18,614
plummeting through space
65 million years ago.

1389
01:33:20,349 --> 01:33:22,284
This is the asteroid that helped
wipe out the dinosaurs.

1390
01:33:22,318 --> 01:33:23,820
Hel... What are you...?
Stop touching it.

1391
01:33:23,853 --> 01:33:25,822
Seriously, what are you
with touching things?

1392
01:33:25,854 --> 01:33:27,623
No, this is part
of their weapon.

1393
01:33:27,657 --> 01:33:29,492
They shot it from their world

1394
01:33:29,524 --> 01:33:32,594
to set this planet up
and wipe the slate clean.

1395
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:35,564
This is Project Rainfall.

1396
01:33:36,431 --> 01:33:37,800
Oh, my God.

1397
01:33:37,832 --> 01:33:39,201
I need to report this in.

1398
01:33:39,234 --> 01:33:40,603
What?

1399
01:33:40,636 --> 01:33:42,172
Right now.

1400
01:33:42,204 --> 01:33:43,605
How are you going to do that?

1401
01:33:43,639 --> 01:33:45,307
Without the proper passcodes
it's impossible.

1402
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:46,943
We've been trying
for the past two years.

1403
01:33:46,975 --> 01:33:49,679
He has the passcodes.
I should have wrote them out.

1404
01:33:49,712 --> 01:33:50,947
Just...

1405
01:33:50,979 --> 01:33:52,614
It's not your fault.
Not your fault.

1406
01:33:52,648 --> 01:33:53,783
No, it is...

1407
01:33:53,815 --> 01:33:55,652
It's his fault.

1408
01:33:55,685 --> 01:33:57,554
I had nothing
to do with it.

1409
01:33:57,587 --> 01:33:59,522
I'm such an idiot.
It wasn't hard.

1410
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:02,792
Can I check my email?
Okay?

1411
01:34:02,824 --> 01:34:04,793
Americans.

1412
01:34:04,827 --> 01:34:07,396
Sir, receiving priority signal
from Matt Simmons.

1413
01:34:08,863 --> 01:34:10,799
Simmons?

1414
01:34:10,832 --> 01:34:13,737
Yeah. One of my loyal soldiers.

1415
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:17,539
Simmons, you're onscreen.
Proceed.

1416
01:34:17,573 --> 01:34:20,276
<i>Commander? We know exactly
what Rainfall is.</i>

1417
01:34:20,309 --> 01:34:22,244
<i>It's like a big...</i>

1418
01:34:22,278 --> 01:34:25,215
<i>Well, it...
It's more like a giant...</i>

1419
01:34:25,247 --> 01:34:26,848
- Would you...?
- No, no, I'm camera shy. No.

1420
01:34:26,881 --> 01:34:28,684
It's a planet slayer

1421
01:34:28,717 --> 01:34:31,220
<i>shot from their system
millions of years ago.</i>

1422
01:34:31,253 --> 01:34:32,622
<i>Their embedded
alien technology</i>

1423
01:34:32,654 --> 01:34:34,556
<i>shaped this world
as we know it.</i>

1424
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:37,293
If thrown at the Earth fast
enough, it'll all happen again.

1425
01:34:37,326 --> 01:34:39,295
It's what they've been
looking for this whole time.

1426
01:34:39,328 --> 01:34:41,998
No, if they get it up to their
colony ship, it is game over.

1427
01:34:45,467 --> 01:34:48,304
You just given me
the delivery system.

1428
01:34:48,337 --> 01:34:50,240
We salt that rock with
the bio agent, they suck it up,

1429
01:34:50,273 --> 01:34:52,507
and we detonate it
right in their faces.

1430
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:54,911
Sir, what about the Greys
still down here?

1431
01:34:54,944 --> 01:34:57,247
It's the price we pay, son.

1432
01:34:57,279 --> 01:34:59,481
Now how do we get them
to take the bait?

1433
01:35:03,485 --> 01:35:05,854
Put the comms back up.

1434
01:35:05,887 --> 01:35:08,390
Stop! Somebody stop him!
Gary, what are you doing?

1435
01:35:08,423 --> 01:35:10,426
I said no touching!

1436
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:11,627
Oh, game over, man.

1437
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:12,996
You cannot let Hayes
do that.

1438
01:35:13,029 --> 01:35:14,931
- You maggot!
- My family...

1439
01:35:14,963 --> 01:35:17,500
How are we supposed
to contact them now?

1440
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:22,606
No!

1441
01:35:29,412 --> 01:35:31,681
Oh, my God,
how'd you do that?

1442
01:35:31,713 --> 01:35:34,650
It's been here 50 years,
and nothing.

1443
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:36,918
Duh. He's Kali.

1444
01:35:36,952 --> 01:35:39,756
His DNA activates it, man.
Don't you know that?

1445
01:35:39,788 --> 01:35:41,824
You really should have
known that.

1446
01:35:56,805 --> 01:35:58,840
That's why you were
so interested in the helmet.

1447
01:35:58,873 --> 01:36:00,777
That's why you wanted
to come here.

1448
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:03,012
And that is why your Kali mates
keep turning up.

1449
01:36:03,045 --> 01:36:05,547
I was Kali.

1450
01:36:06,748 --> 01:36:09,018
I am no longer.

1451
01:36:09,051 --> 01:36:10,453
I'm not gonna let you do this.

1452
01:36:10,485 --> 01:36:11,887
- Get out of the way, kid.
- No.

1453
01:36:11,921 --> 01:36:13,556
He could have killed us
ten times over.

1454
01:36:13,588 --> 01:36:14,823
- Not happening.
- I wanted to find it

1455
01:36:14,856 --> 01:36:15,925
before them.

1456
01:36:15,957 --> 01:36:17,793
There is only one.

1457
01:36:17,827 --> 01:36:20,762
They cannot reproduce it
in space.

1458
01:36:20,796 --> 01:36:22,899
I want to stop it.

1459
01:36:25,768 --> 01:36:29,072
I risked my life
and that of my family

1460
01:36:29,104 --> 01:36:31,840
to align myself with you
and your kind.

1461
01:36:33,475 --> 01:36:35,510
I can never go back.

1462
01:36:35,543 --> 01:36:38,347
So if you can't trust me...

1463
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:44,454
...you'd better kill me.

1464
01:36:46,855 --> 01:36:49,125
Wow, man.

1465
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:50,693
You guys are intense.

1466
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:51,993
Wait.

1467
01:36:52,027 --> 01:36:53,730
If they find this and use it,

1468
01:36:53,762 --> 01:36:55,364
how long does it take
for the dust to settle?

1469
01:36:55,398 --> 01:36:58,900
Our pods keep us sleeping.

1470
01:36:58,934 --> 01:37:01,904
It's like we left
our planet yesterday.

1471
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:04,539
They've destroyed almost every
North American city

1472
01:37:04,573 --> 01:37:06,543
with space rocks.

1473
01:37:07,443 --> 01:37:08,644
And Sydney.

1474
01:37:08,676 --> 01:37:10,078
What, Sydney's been destroyed?

1475
01:37:10,112 --> 01:37:12,081
The Sydney survivors
are mounting a defense

1476
01:37:12,113 --> 01:37:14,983
at Hayes' base as we speak.

1477
01:37:15,016 --> 01:37:17,153
Well, how do you know
all this stuff?

1478
01:37:17,185 --> 01:37:19,087
Because, Peter,

1479
01:37:19,121 --> 01:37:21,791
I'm the fucking U.S. government.

1480
01:37:21,823 --> 01:37:24,760
And he has access
to a high-orbit spy satellite.

1481
01:37:25,627 --> 01:37:26,996
No, I don't.

1482
01:37:27,029 --> 01:37:28,665
No, he doesn't.

1483
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:31,433
Oh.

1484
01:37:32,935 --> 01:37:35,505
Oh, that's not good.

1485
01:37:35,537 --> 01:37:37,373
They're here.

1486
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:41,042
Matt, Marcus is right.

1487
01:37:41,076 --> 01:37:43,980
He's a ballsy fighter
and he wants to work with us.

1488
01:37:44,012 --> 01:37:46,448
You've got major
trust issues, bro.

1489
01:37:46,481 --> 01:37:49,918
I'm not quite sure
what their story is.

1490
01:37:49,952 --> 01:37:52,422
Now what are we going to do?

1491
01:37:52,454 --> 01:37:54,724
Hayes preys on
the weak, Matthew.

1492
01:37:56,458 --> 01:37:57,827
You are not weak.

1493
01:38:02,898 --> 01:38:05,135
Are you sure they can't build
another one?

1494
01:38:07,136 --> 01:38:09,406
Correct.

1495
01:38:10,072 --> 01:38:11,474
We blow it.

1496
01:38:11,506 --> 01:38:13,009
Yeah!

1497
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:16,679
We have gas cylinders
and gallons of bleach.

1498
01:38:16,712 --> 01:38:19,482
Potassium chloride and liquid
petroleum gas will ignite.

1499
01:38:19,515 --> 01:38:21,684
- I'll rig a detonator.
- Got it.

1500
01:38:21,716 --> 01:38:23,118
I got a gun.

1501
01:38:23,152 --> 01:38:24,587
It's Christmas-taped
to my back.

1502
01:38:24,619 --> 01:38:26,456
- Shut up.
- Huh?

1503
01:38:26,488 --> 01:38:28,490
Bud, what can you do
with 60 minutes over here?

1504
01:38:28,524 --> 01:38:30,793
I can have access to the whole
facility from the control room.

1505
01:38:30,826 --> 01:38:32,094
- Slow them down.
- Do it.

1506
01:38:32,127 --> 01:38:34,497
Gary, Bella, Marcus,
with me.

1507
01:38:34,529 --> 01:38:36,032
Gladly.

1508
01:38:36,064 --> 01:38:37,866
Watch your back, Bella.

1509
01:38:37,899 --> 01:38:40,869
Okay, I need a battery.

1510
01:38:40,903 --> 01:38:42,672
Just follow me.
Just walk this way.

1511
01:38:42,704 --> 01:38:44,172
Some kind of toggle switch.

1512
01:38:44,206 --> 01:38:45,908
On it.

1513
01:38:47,609 --> 01:38:49,211
<i>Urgent Starlight call signs</i>

1514
01:38:49,244 --> 01:38:50,979
<i>required in the holding cells.</i>

1515
01:38:51,012 --> 01:38:54,216
<i>Multiple priorities,
one and two injuries.</i>

1516
01:38:59,054 --> 01:39:01,891
<i>There have been multiple
breaches in block Alpha.</i>

1517
01:39:01,923 --> 01:39:04,126
Go! Go! Go!

1518
01:39:19,173 --> 01:39:20,676
I'm getting overwhelmed!

1519
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:22,278
Get all access now.

1520
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:24,546
- Oh, fuck!
- Zero One.

1521
01:39:43,164 --> 01:39:45,033
Get up!

1522
01:39:45,067 --> 01:39:46,702
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

1523
01:40:07,122 --> 01:40:09,726
Fall back. Fall back!

1524
01:40:20,002 --> 01:40:22,104
One ship just bugged out.

1525
01:40:22,136 --> 01:40:25,006
Pass to all aircraft.
Vector the remaining ships.

1526
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:27,143
The remaining ships
are the primary targets.

1527
01:40:28,676 --> 01:40:30,947
This is it, boys and girls.
This is it.

1528
01:40:33,782 --> 01:40:34,917
It's all right.
It's all right.

1529
01:40:36,085 --> 01:40:37,619
Amelia. Amelia, what's going on?

1530
01:40:37,653 --> 01:40:39,055
Are you still good
with the fighter pilot?

1531
01:40:39,087 --> 01:40:41,224
- Well, I hope so.
- That's good. Come on.

1532
01:41:05,346 --> 01:41:06,881
Open fire!

1533
01:41:22,664 --> 01:41:24,300
Stay there!

1534
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,190
On your left!

1535
01:42:12,448 --> 01:42:16,185
Zorro to Command.
Time on target: two minutes.

1536
01:42:17,786 --> 01:42:19,855
- Radio room?
- Hey there.

1537
01:42:19,887 --> 01:42:22,091
- Yes, sir...
- You mind?

1538
01:42:22,123 --> 01:42:24,027
Huh? Not at all.

1539
01:42:26,729 --> 01:42:29,030
Okay, uh...

1540
01:42:29,064 --> 01:42:30,432
You know what
you're doing?

1541
01:42:30,466 --> 01:42:32,001
Oh, I just got to find
a frequency.

1542
01:42:32,033 --> 01:42:33,435
Is this it?

1543
01:42:33,469 --> 01:42:36,238
<i>Dennis, hurry.</i>

1544
01:42:36,270 --> 01:42:37,739
<i>Is this it? That's not it.</i>

1545
01:42:37,773 --> 01:42:39,074
<i>Come on, Dennis.</i>

1546
01:42:39,108 --> 01:42:40,743
<i>This is it. This is it.</i>

1547
01:42:40,775 --> 01:42:43,278
Call sign, Zorro.
Come in, over.

1548
01:42:43,311 --> 01:42:45,081
Incoming fighters.

1549
01:42:45,113 --> 01:42:47,250
<i>Red-hot.
Three o'clock. Coming in hot.</i>

1550
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,351
<i>Zorro, come in, over.</i>

1551
01:42:50,385 --> 01:42:51,487
Who is that?

1552
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,089
Identify yourself.

1553
01:42:53,122 --> 01:42:54,457
Robin, it's me.

1554
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:56,091
You can't fire those missiles.

1555
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:59,028
<i>I say again,
abort your mission.</i>

1556
01:43:09,404 --> 01:43:11,340
<i>Zorro, come in, over.</i>

1557
01:43:11,372 --> 01:43:13,808
Unidentified station on this
frequency, clear immediately.

1558
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:16,478
This is military broadcast
and you are interfering.

1559
01:43:16,511 --> 01:43:18,514
Break, break, Zorro Lead.
Time to target?

1560
01:43:18,546 --> 01:43:20,515
Forty-five seconds, sir.

1561
01:43:20,548 --> 01:43:22,118
Watch that cross fire.

1562
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:24,252
Robin, this is Amelia.
Can you hear me?

1563
01:43:25,354 --> 01:43:26,789
Robin?

1564
01:43:27,922 --> 01:43:29,425
That little bitch.

1565
01:43:29,457 --> 01:43:31,460
She's somewhere in the facility.
Go get her. Now.

1566
01:43:31,493 --> 01:43:34,096
Now!

1567
01:43:34,128 --> 01:43:36,030
Robin, I don't know
if you knew

1568
01:43:36,064 --> 01:43:37,466
what Hayes is doing downstairs.

1569
01:43:37,498 --> 01:43:39,835
<i>He's killing
all our alien allies.</i>

1570
01:43:39,868 --> 01:43:41,403
That weapon you are carrying
won't distinguish

1571
01:43:41,435 --> 01:43:43,072
<i>friendly Greys
from enemy ones.</i>

1572
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:45,273
<i>It's going to wipe them
all out.</i>

1573
01:43:45,306 --> 01:43:47,108
Zorro Lead,
you are being spoofed.

1574
01:43:47,141 --> 01:43:48,943
Disregard all transmissions
from anyone but me.

1575
01:43:48,976 --> 01:43:51,079
<i>Close on target
and initiate attack.</i>

1576
01:43:51,113 --> 01:43:53,950
Getting heavy fire.
I'm coming around.

1577
01:43:56,417 --> 01:43:58,319
Robin, Robin,
I know you can hear us.

1578
01:43:58,353 --> 01:44:00,322
Listen to what
she has to say.

1579
01:44:00,354 --> 01:44:02,423
Squadron Leader, there is one
way to defeat this enemy today.

1580
01:44:02,457 --> 01:44:03,993
Time to target?

1581
01:44:04,025 --> 01:44:05,394
Copy. 30 seconds to target.

1582
01:44:05,426 --> 01:44:08,563
Abraham just died
for this cause.

1583
01:44:08,596 --> 01:44:10,298
<i>He gave his life,</i>

1584
01:44:10,332 --> 01:44:11,967
<i>and I swear on
mine the Greys on our side</i>

1585
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,536
want to save what we can.

1586
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:16,005
Jesus Christ, Robin,
think about this.

1587
01:44:16,037 --> 01:44:18,907
Remember how you felt
when you lost your family?

1588
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,543
There's fucking women
and children downstairs.

1589
01:44:21,577 --> 01:44:23,813
Come on, there'll be no peace,
ever.

1590
01:44:25,213 --> 01:44:27,015
Robin, I promise you
we'll find a way.

1591
01:44:27,048 --> 01:44:29,952
<i>This is not it.</i>

1592
01:44:29,984 --> 01:44:31,853
Control, Zorro be advised,

1593
01:44:31,886 --> 01:44:33,822
<i>I'm pulling off the target
vector at this time.</i>

1594
01:44:33,855 --> 01:44:36,157
There they are! Open fire!

1595
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:38,894
There they are!

1596
01:44:38,926 --> 01:44:41,063
<i>This is an abort. Break. Break.</i>

1597
01:44:41,095 --> 01:44:43,464
<i>All Zorro birds,
abort, abort, abort.</i>

1598
01:44:43,497 --> 01:44:45,433
<i>Roger that.</i>

1599
01:44:46,368 --> 01:44:48,103
Zorro Wingman?

1600
01:44:48,136 --> 01:44:49,305
On it.

1601
01:44:49,337 --> 01:44:51,106
Yes, you are.

1602
01:44:59,981 --> 01:45:02,018
Goddamn it, Blackbird.
I said abort.

1603
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:18,000
Whoo!

1604
01:45:18,634 --> 01:45:20,536
Fucking bravo.

1605
01:45:27,408 --> 01:45:30,144
And there we go.
And there we are.

1606
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:50,666
Amelia, we have taken
the control room.

1607
01:45:50,698 --> 01:45:52,367
Suarez is critical.

1608
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,302
Put pressure on this wound!

1609
01:45:54,336 --> 01:45:56,305
Hayes is on the run.

1610
01:45:56,337 --> 01:45:58,340
Amelia?

1611
01:46:00,242 --> 01:46:01,610
Go get Hayes.
I'll hold them off.

1612
01:46:01,643 --> 01:46:03,578
- Cover me then.
- Go!

1613
01:46:27,636 --> 01:46:30,105
On the right.

1614
01:46:30,137 --> 01:46:32,507
- Painfully familiar.
- Who would have thought?

1615
01:47:24,326 --> 01:47:26,295
Matt, two aliens coming down
the west corridor.

1616
01:47:26,328 --> 01:47:28,197
Oh, this isn't good.
This isn't good, man.

1617
01:47:28,229 --> 01:47:30,465
They're going to find me.
When they do, they're...

1618
01:47:30,498 --> 01:47:32,001
- Steve.
- What? What?

1619
01:47:32,033 --> 01:47:33,768
- Stay cool.
- Yeah. Sure, cool.

1620
01:47:33,801 --> 01:47:35,436
See those Kalis going down
the service tunnel?

1621
01:47:35,470 --> 01:47:37,172
- Yeah, so?
- Cool.

1622
01:47:37,204 --> 01:47:39,173
We can vent
the cooling systems.

1623
01:47:39,207 --> 01:47:41,377
- The heating pumps.
- Barbecue.

1624
01:47:41,409 --> 01:47:43,244
Yeah. Yeah, man.

1625
01:47:45,313 --> 01:47:47,082
- Yeah!
- Booyah!

1626
01:47:47,114 --> 01:47:49,518
- What else you got?
- Time to take out the trash!

1627
01:47:49,551 --> 01:47:51,420
Or surrender.

1628
01:47:51,453 --> 01:47:53,389
We had a good run.

1629
01:47:53,421 --> 01:47:55,590
- Oh, it's Peter.
- Let me in, Bud!

1630
01:47:55,623 --> 01:47:57,458
Yeah. Yeah. Come in.

1631
01:47:57,492 --> 01:48:00,029
Two men in the pool room.

1632
01:48:00,061 --> 01:48:02,230
Check it out, man. Ha-ha!

1633
01:48:18,747 --> 01:48:20,282
Come on!

1634
01:48:27,655 --> 01:48:30,125
Ugh!

1635
01:48:30,158 --> 01:48:31,560
Ha!

1636
01:48:51,445 --> 01:48:53,048
De nada.

1637
01:49:01,689 --> 01:49:03,291
Take that, assholes.

1638
01:49:10,465 --> 01:49:13,269
Get back to the rock.
Make sure Pete blows it.

1639
01:49:15,537 --> 01:49:17,106
Move!

1640
01:49:37,359 --> 01:49:39,528
Stampede!

1641
01:49:45,367 --> 01:49:47,668
- Good boys.
- You're welcome.

1642
01:49:53,408 --> 01:49:55,410
Everybody move!
Bugging out to Pine Gap.

1643
01:49:55,443 --> 01:49:57,846
Sir, military test weapon
reaching max distance now.

1644
01:49:57,878 --> 01:49:59,614
One kilometer in diameter.

1645
01:49:59,648 --> 01:50:01,850
The prevailing winds
will help.

1646
01:50:01,882 --> 01:50:03,719
The enemy outside
have all been affected.

1647
01:50:03,752 --> 01:50:05,554
- What about the Greys downstairs?
- No reaction.

1648
01:50:05,587 --> 01:50:07,222
We are deep within
the mountain.

1649
01:50:07,255 --> 01:50:09,525
- It may take time.
- We don't have time.

1650
01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:21,335
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

1651
01:50:21,368 --> 01:50:23,771
<i>Enact order 1811.</i>

1652
01:50:23,805 --> 01:50:25,407
<i>Kill all non-humans.</i>

1653
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:27,576
<i>I say again,
all non-humans</i>

1654
01:50:27,609 --> 01:50:30,846
<i>are now considered an enemy
and are to be killed on sight.</i>

1655
01:50:31,979 --> 01:50:33,214
Don't fucking move.

1656
01:50:33,247 --> 01:50:34,682
- Don't move.
- Okay.

1657
01:50:34,716 --> 01:50:36,886
Stop right there.
It's over.

1658
01:50:37,985 --> 01:50:40,890
Let's hope so.
All right? Yeah?

1659
01:50:47,261 --> 01:50:48,730
Okay?

1660
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:58,472
Is this what you wanted? Hmm?

1661
01:50:58,506 --> 01:51:02,744
To die for your little
fucking cause?

1662
01:51:28,670 --> 01:51:30,471
What cause are you
about to die for?

1663
01:51:30,505 --> 01:51:31,672
Huh?

1664
01:51:39,346 --> 01:51:40,581
Hey!

1665
01:52:18,987 --> 01:52:20,622
<i>This is Captain Wessex.</i>

1666
01:52:20,654 --> 01:52:21,989
<i>I have assumed command.</i>

1667
01:52:22,023 --> 01:52:23,824
Wing Commander Hayes is dead,

1668
01:52:23,858 --> 01:52:25,494
<i>and all his directives
are terminated.</i>

1669
01:52:25,527 --> 01:52:26,761
Fall back to the command center!

1670
01:52:26,795 --> 01:52:27,962
<i>Prepare final evac.</i>

1671
01:52:27,996 --> 01:52:29,364
Cover and go.

1672
01:52:29,396 --> 01:52:31,466
Fall back!

1673
01:52:56,623 --> 01:52:58,059
Where's Dad?

1674
01:52:58,092 --> 01:52:59,894
Where are the detonators?

1675
01:52:59,927 --> 01:53:01,829
The bomb?

1676
01:53:08,369 --> 01:53:10,104
You look like a shit,
Matthew.

1677
01:53:10,137 --> 01:53:12,073
Well, there's
that sense of humor.

1678
01:53:36,463 --> 01:53:39,501
What's happening? Aah!

1679
01:53:57,618 --> 01:53:59,387
Ah! What the...?

1680
01:53:59,421 --> 01:54:01,655
Oh, God. Help me.
I've seen this movie.

1681
01:54:01,689 --> 01:54:03,825
- Ah!
- Impossible.

1682
01:54:03,858 --> 01:54:05,159
Come on, Bud.
Oh, Mama.

1683
01:54:05,193 --> 01:54:06,994
Oh, shit.

1684
01:54:14,935 --> 01:54:16,537
Bella, what's happening?

1685
01:54:44,698 --> 01:54:46,601
Cut it!

1686
01:54:47,801 --> 01:54:50,005
Cut it! Cut it!

1687
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:03,819
Back, Gary!

1688
01:55:08,523 --> 01:55:11,159
Help me, Matthew.

1689
01:55:11,192 --> 01:55:12,761
Gary!

1690
01:55:18,233 --> 01:55:20,936
Hey!

1691
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:27,775
You're not dying
on me yet, brother.

1692
01:56:20,595 --> 01:56:23,198
Bella! Bella!

1693
01:56:23,230 --> 01:56:25,166
Bella!

1694
01:56:27,301 --> 01:56:28,871
Bella.

1695
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:32,106
Okay, let's go!
Let's clear! Come on!

1696
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:35,711
Let's get all these alien Greys
on the move.

1697
01:56:39,881 --> 01:56:42,150
Amelia.

1698
01:57:36,738 --> 01:57:39,106
<i>All Zorro birds, new mission.</i>

1699
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:42,077
Air cover for the evacuation.

1700
01:57:48,181 --> 01:57:51,152
<i>We shall never let
these invaders take our land!</i>

1701
01:57:51,185 --> 01:57:53,855
<i>Fight till your last breath.</i>

1702
01:57:53,887 --> 01:57:56,024
<i>Fight for the wing commander.</i>

1703
01:57:56,056 --> 01:57:59,793
<i>You will be seen
as heroes of humanity.</i>

1704
01:57:59,827 --> 01:58:01,863
We shall never let these
invaders take our land.

1705
01:58:01,895 --> 01:58:03,764
Watch it!

1706
01:58:07,935 --> 01:58:09,371
Incoming!

1707
01:58:15,342 --> 01:58:17,211
Robin, thank you.

1708
01:58:17,244 --> 01:58:19,680
- You did the right thing.
- <i>I hope so.</i>

1709
01:58:19,713 --> 01:58:22,850
I only hope Amelia's
right about this.

1710
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:13,028
Matt and Marcus,
they were all here.

1711
02:00:15,962 --> 02:00:17,832
They took them.

1712
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,002
They took them.

1713
