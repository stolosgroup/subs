The...

27
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,336
I'm sorry, I...

28
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,139
My mistake, I thought
you were someone else.

29
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,256
No, no, wait a minute,
kid, kid, kid...

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,800
I forgot what
I was supposed to say,

31
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,885
Y'know, like...

32
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,553
"The rain's good
for the farmers,"

33
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,347
"Grow some crops,"
some shit like that.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,598
Mr. Burmeister?

35
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,892
Yeah, Burmeister. Sit down.

36
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,523
Oh, hey, I...
I brought the money.

37
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,484
Pss-pss-pss... later.

38
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,526
Yeah.

39
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,529
You're dealing with a professional here.

40
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,780
Bingo.

41
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,075
Hey, a man's gotta do somethin'.

42
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,951
Besides, it's
too early in the day

43
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,119
to be chasin' pussy.

44
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,757
Carl Harding. Sorry I'm late.

45
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,217
It's your hour.

46
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,778
50 minutes. But who's counting, right?

47
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,099
So, Carl, why don't you...

48
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,350
I'm sorry, before we begin,

49
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,811
Please make sure that
the bills go to my office,

50
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,145
not to my house.

51
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,397
- Sure.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,191
So why don't you
start at the beginning,

53
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,902
and tell me why
you've come to see me.

54
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,195
Right.

55
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,738
You wanna hear about
my mom and my childhood,

56
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,379
is that the kinda shit
you're looking for?

57
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,784
If that's why you're here.

58
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,576
No, it's not.

59
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,786
What do I look like?

60
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,329
Just to set the record straight,

61
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,621
I Just made partner

62
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,342
at the second-largest law firm
in the state,

63
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:28,827
so I'm doing very well, thank you.

64
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:31,295
So I don't
mean to brag, but you asked.

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,879
No I didn't.

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,799
Okay.

67
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,592
So you're here because...?

68
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,304
I'm here because

69
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,057
I've got this thing
going on with a woman...

70
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,267
Not my mom!

71
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,185
It's not.

72
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,397

Got a minute?

77
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,497
In a second.

78
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,665
Come on.

79
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,168
I hope this
is important, Charlie,

80
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,213
I've got Junior choir practice
in twenty minutes.

81
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:14,296
I need to talk.

82
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,659
This won't keep till confession?

83
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,633
I really need some help with this.

84
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,510
Is it a woman?

85
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,981
I'm so glad you could help me with this.

86
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,400
I don't know what to do,

87
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,235
I knew you'd help me
sort this out.

88
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,241
I'm here for you, Charlie,
no matter what it is.

89
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:40,656
Now, Just take your time,

90
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,257
and tell me everything
about this woman.

91
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,450
I got all day.

92
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,662
I don't usually do
this sort of thing.

93
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,332
I've never done this before, y'know?

94
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,625
That's okay, sweetie.

95
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,794
You can start with the next game
on the green sheet.

96
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,879
It's four-card crazy bingo.

97
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,631
Ten dollars.

98
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,236
Lemme get two cups of coffee, please.

99
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,718
Yeah. Two cups for me, too.

100
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,012
O-76...

101
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,767
0-55, 0-5-5.

102
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,644
Y-y-you gotta know...

103
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,063
I got my reasons for doing this.

104
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,273
Well, that's nice.

105
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,858
See, not too long ago,

106
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,194
my life was goin' along Just fine.

107
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,780
I was happy...

108
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,449
Well, maybe I wasn't happy,

109
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,411
but, y'know, I was content.

110
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,539
I had a Job, I had friends...

111
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,375
I had a house...

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,043
I had everything but...

113
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,920
That steady bang?

114
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,300
"She," the squeeze, the girlfriend...

115
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,634
Whatever you wanna call a chick.

116
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,845
Yeah, right.

117
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,889
And then I met her...

118
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,185
This whole thing
started one night at McCool's

119
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,814
The place was packed,
even my cousin Carl was there,

120
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,649
and I was in the zone

121
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,401
Everybody's got their power base...

122
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,945
Pouring drinks is my specialty

123
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,447
I was puttin on quite a show

124
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,824
for the frat boys
at the end of the bar

125
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,451
Awright, who wants to take the plunge?

126
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,578
I want it!

127
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,622
Awright, I know
its only bartending,

128
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,957
but hey, I m good at it

129
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,502
Awright, folks,
let's go, wrap it up.

130
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:18,462
What a setup!

131
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,548
You must get laid
like... all the time.

132
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,591
Oh, yeah.

133
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,302
The girls are
linin' up around the block.

134
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,887
Fuck, I knew it!

135
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,090
They Just can't resist a man

136
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,820
working for tips in the service industry.

137
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,683
Tell me!
Gimme, gimme, gimme...

138
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,727
Y'know, Carl, I appreciate
your comin' down here

139
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,250
and gettin' shit-faced drunk, but...

140
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,062
Haaa!

141
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,303
Don't you think it's about time

142
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:39,983
you went home to Karen and the kids?

143
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,526
Well, that would be a good idea,

144
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,154
except they're
visiting Grandma in Ohio.

145
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,781
What about that thing called a Job?

146
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,950
You might wanna go home
and sober up for an hour or two

147
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,596
before goin' in
and facing the partners

148
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:53,123
of Do-We Cheat-Em And How.

149
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,749
Close. You must mean
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.

150
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,834
Take a card, young man,
because you never know.

151
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,962
What are you tryin' to do,

152
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,296
you tryin' to get rid of me?

153
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,174
Hey! Let's go
to one of those after hours clubs.

154
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,802
They got these long,
long-legged girls there,

155
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,971
you can look at them
and maybe touch them.

156
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,639
I gotta close up.

157
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,042
You think Just 'cause I'm married

158
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,475
I don't know about these places?

159
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,018
Just because you are married

160
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,147
means you're gettin' it
a whole lot more than me.

161
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,606
That's a depressing thought.

162
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,192
Carl, you need me
to call you a cab?

163
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,860
Oh, no...

164
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,386
you Just sobered me up pretty good.

165
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,288
Get home safe.

166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,702
It had been a fairly busy night

167
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,704
so by the time
I closed the register

168
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,455
and cleaned up the Joint,

169
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,874
all I wanted to do was go home

170
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,171
Where are you going?!

171
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,715
Stop the car!

172
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:46,108
Do you hear what I'm tellin' ya?!

173
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,301
Don't touch me!

174
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:48,969
Get over here!

175
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,512
Let go of me!

176
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,472
Hey!

177
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,475
Awright, go!

178
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,491
Fuck you!

179
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,662
And there she was...

180
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,336
This is not the kind of girl

181
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,422
you usually run into
In a dark alley

182
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,967
In fact, this is not
the kind of girl

183
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,219
I ever run into

184
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,349
You okay?

185
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,559
No, I'm not okay.

186
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,646
Some smelly guy
Just tried to rape me.

187
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,230
What a Jerk! Here.

188
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,691
You want me to call the police?

189
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,610
I-I know you're Just
trying to help,

190
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,013
but spending
the rest of the night

191
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:49,529
with a bunch of ass hole cops

192
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,157
isn't exactly what I need right now.

193
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,867
Your...

194
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,703
Thanks.

195
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,251
You got a smoke?

196
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,170
No, sorry.

197
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,130
This really is my night.

198
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,299
I bet I could
find you one in the bar.

199
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,550
It's okay.

200
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,928
I'm tryin' to cut down anyway.

201
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,769
- You're gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

202
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,105
Okay, alright.
I'll see you around.

203
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:25,649
Hey!

204
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,777
What are you doin' right now?

205
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,070
Whaddya mean?

206
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,154
Well, I mean, look,

207
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,116
I Just had this little
unpleasant experience,

208
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,994
and I don't especially
feel like being by myself.

209
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,787
Right, right.

210
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,415
Well, I was Just gonna go home.

211
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,542
You got a stereo?

212
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,586
Well, I got a boom box.

213
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,298
Only one of the speakers
is workin', so...

214
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,133
I don't know if
you call it a stereo.

215
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:54,052
You wanna go
listen to some music?

216
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,722
Where's your car?

217
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,098
Actually, I Just live
a couple of blocks...

218
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,768
- Hun... no car.
- Sorry.

219
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,186
Hey.

220
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,152
So, do you live
in a house or an apartment?

221
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,367
Well, this is it.

222
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,543
You live here alone?

223
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,422
It was my mother's before she died.

224
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,215
You own it?

225
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,217
Yeah.

226
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,472
You're so lucky.

227
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,016
I've always dreamt
of having my own place.

228
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,358
I know what you're thinking...

229
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,610
The police station
might be cheerier?

230
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,153
It's great.

231
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,321
Yeah.

232
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,911
Lot of potential.

233
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,455
"A lot of potential."

234
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,874
What is she,
a real estate agent?

235
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,542
Can I get you something to drink?

236
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,087
Tap water,

237
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:12,214
I got beer,

238
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,591
I got tap water,

239
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,009
I think I got...

240
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,846
I may have a Yoo-Hoo.

241
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,515
Beer sounds good.

242
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,393
I forgot. I drank
the last one this morning.

243
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,230
I can make some tea

244
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,815
or coffee...

245
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,941
That's fine, thanks.

246
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,194
Well, tea, anyway.

247
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,321
Water's fine.
Maybe some ice?

248
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,948
Water.

249
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,911
Sorry, no,

250
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,288
no ice.

251
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,582
My freezer's on the blink.

252
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,920
How is it?

253
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,005
What?

254
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:53,922
The water.

255
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,966
Fine.

256
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,015
Do you like water?

257
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,474
I love it.

258
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,768
It's actually
my second favorite thing in the world.

259
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,813
Really? And what's
your first favorite?

260
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,315
Fucking.

261
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:28,957
What?!

262
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,169
It's my mom's room.

A woman after my own heart...

282
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,306
Hun-hun.

283
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,978
You have no idea
what this woman is capable of.

284
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,855
I guess you don't have to
worry about that anymore,

285
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,565
do you?

286
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,484
I don't think of myself
as the kind of person

287
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,069
who's in this kind of office.

288
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,822
When I think about people
who are in therapy,

289
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:45,492
these are people who don't
have their lives in control.

290
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,245
I am...
I'm in control of my life,

291
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,205
my life is-is in control,

292
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,165
that is not a problem for me.

293
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,459
What about the woman
you mentioned?

294
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,921
Right.

295
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:05,177
It started
one night at McCool's...

296
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,055
Its a kind of a low-rent Joint

297
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,100
Ordinarily I would
never be seen dead

298
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,977
in a place like this

299
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,855
Hey! Who wants to take the plunge?

300
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,232
But on this particular night,

301
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:21,028
Karen had taken the kids
to Ohio to visit her mom

302
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,903
So I decided to
dropin on my cousin,

303
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,240
who I hadn't seen in a long time

304
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,824
We re talking about

305
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,452
an adult who thinks it's fun

306
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,454
to drink out of
a toilet plunger.

307
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,332
I mean, this is
the mentality we're dealing with here.

308
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,208
Let's Just stay focused
on the woman, okay?

309
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,085
Right.

310
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,879
The woman, okay

311
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,006
Well, I look across the room

312
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,216
and I saw

313
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,476
a very beautiful woman.

314
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,773
I hung around
hoping shed come back,

315
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:58,940
but she didn t

316
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,068
Okay, time for me to go.

317
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,569
It was pretty late,

318
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,073
and I d had a few drinks

319
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,202
And there she was

320
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,120
I'm Just a little bit nervous.

321
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,538
How do I look?

322
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,165
She was with this guy,

323
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,999
and I thought maybe
this is not the best time

324
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,044
to hit on this particular woman

325
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,754
What is this, PMS week?

326
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,840
So I got in my car and

327
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,551
I don't know, I started
to doze off a little,

328
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,887
and I hear all this
screaming and cursing.

329
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,932
Don't touch me, asshole!

330
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,392
I'm gettin' out!

331
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:35,519
Hey!

332
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,495
Tits.

333
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,663
Fuck you!

334
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,497
And you didn't try to help?

335
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,791
I would have.

336
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,376
But?

337
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,170
I may have fallen asleep.

338
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,922
You should know...

339
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,258
I was practically
forced into this.

340
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,968
Jewel?

341
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,139
Jewel?

342
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,854
I...

343
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,731
I suppose it's not gonna help

344
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,983
If I tell you
that was really amazing?

345
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,860
I know it was.

346
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,611
That's the problem.

347
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,825
To tell ya the truth...

348
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,870
I only took
one psychology course

349
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,955
in Junior college,

350
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,249
I know there's
supposed to be this thing

351
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:44,004
where you're sad
or you're guilty after...

352
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,506
Well, I personally
don't suffer from that.

353
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:48,634
It's not that.

354
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,177
Don't you see?

355
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,387
That guy tonight...

356
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,640
that creep in the firebird?

357
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,017
I know that guy.

358
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,810
Of course you know the guy.

359
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,729
Let's face it,
you're not the type of girl

360
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,732
who Just Jumps into a car
with some smelly guy

361
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,525
that you don't even know,

362
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,277
I know that.

363
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,737
No...

364
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,031
He and I are...

365
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,866
doing this...

366
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,159
thing.

367
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,746
Oh, shit, I really like you.

368
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,706
What do you mean by "thing"?

369
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,210
He and I get in this fight,

370
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:26,588
and then you or whoever

371
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,632
comes to my rescue

372
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,635
and takes me home, and then...

373
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:35,389
He like shows up and we rob you.

374
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,515
What?

375
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,601
We rob you.

376
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,520
I mean, do you believe that?

377
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,397
I'm shocked.

378
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,983
I-I take it this is

379
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,025
something that
you-you've done before?

380
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,945
Just a couple of times.

381
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,738
I know it sounds sick,

382
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,907
but you don't know Utah, he's nuts.

383
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,535
How does he know
where we are, anyway?

384
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,744
I'm supposed to
call him and tell him.

385
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,622
You-you haven't
done that yet, have you?

386
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,958
Of course not!

387
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,127
Oh, good.

388
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,045
Good...

389
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,131
Okay.

390
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,174
I got it.

391
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,509
Don't call him.

392
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,179
Let's call the police instead.

393
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,518
Not if you ever
want to see me again.

394
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,271
Right.

395
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:25,897
Y'know, I generally

396
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,984
think better
with my shoes on, so...

397
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,451
This guy Utah, is he a mormon?

398
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,786
I wouldn't say that.

399
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,747
I didn't think so.

400
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,293
You know, this guy...

401
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:50,213
He sounds like
a ma Jor piece of shit, you know?

402
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,535
You wouldn't be
talkin' about me,

403
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,562
would ya, loverboy?

404
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,055
Wh-why didn't you call?

405
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,182
I was Just about to.

406
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:03,518
Has this guy
got anything worth takin'?

407
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,063
Old TV, a VCR.

408
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,105
He's got a boom box,

409
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,815
but only one speaker works.

410
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:10,651
A Mr. Coffee machine.

411
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,485
Telephone...

412
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,822
Oh yeah, and one light
hooked up to the clapper.

413
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,994
Hey, that was my mom's.

414
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,871
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

415
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:26,083
You stand there,
you call me a piece of shit!

416
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,127
I'm the piece of shit?

417
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:32,714
I'm here with my lady,
you understand?

418
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,175
It is a touchy situation!

419
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,678
Has he got a car?

420
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,845
No.

421
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,055
No?

422
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,140
He's pathetic!

423
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,685
You-you don't got a car?

424
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,687
Everybody's got a car today...

425
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:50,565
Even bums don't not got a car!

426
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,358
What do you do when
you take a chick out,

427
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,527
you go on a bus?

428
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:55,904
Think you're gonna
get laid on a bus?

429
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,308
Think you're gonna
give some chick

430
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,419
the fuckin' monster on a bus?

431
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,122
I got a car...

432
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,374
The "piece of shit's" got a car!

433
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,335
What about Jewelry,
has he got Jewelry?

434
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,337
Just a Swatch

435
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,965
Nice leather band, though.

436
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,010
Oh yeah?
Take it off.

437
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,182
C'mon, you're so slow.

438
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,310
It's right over here.

439
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,021
Awright, you're up,
slugger, let's go.

440
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:30,439
You want me to open it?

441
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,691
No, I want you
to dance with it...

442
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,109
Move!

443
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,319
Okay.

444
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,987
And if there's
a gun in there, Just leave it.

445
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,788
'Cause you'll
pull it out, you'll get nervous,

446
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:41,574
you'll wind up miss in' me,

447
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,201
then I gotta do
what I gotta do with what I got.

448
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,287
Look at me.

449
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,706
Look at me when I talk to you!

450
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:50,082
I can't look at you
and look at the safe at the same time.

451
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,002
Excuse me, okay.

452
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,921
You're the big-shot now,
I'm nobody, right?

453
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,549
Okay, I'm over here now.

454
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:00,093
Excuse me.

455
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,473
Got any other features
on this watch?

456
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:06,932
It's got a stopwatch.

457
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,268
It's got a stopwatch?

458
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,145
I never figured out
how to use it.

459
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,980
It's simple, it's this button...

460
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,511
What happened?

461
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,721
He was gonna kill you.

462
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:47,432
Really?

463
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:49,476
I mean, he was Just...

464
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,103
He could definitely
tell that there was

465
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:52,896
something going on
between us, y'know?

466
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:54,189
How?

467
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,190
Because I've never
actually slept with

468
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,317
any of the other guys
that I've done this with before,

469
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,611
that's how.

470
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,739
Is he dead?

471
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,410
Oh, Jesus.

472
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,872
Do you hate me now?

473
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,165
No, no, no, no.

474
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,332
No.

475
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,960
Oh yes, you do!

476
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,421
No, it's not that, okay?

477
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,589
It's Just the sex
and the violence

478
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:22,134
all in one night,
it's a little much.

479
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,845
- What are we gonna do now?
- What?

480
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,566
- What are we gonna do now?!
- I don't know!

481
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,509
Well, think of something!

482
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,643
Let's call the police.

483
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,437
That's a good idea.

484
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,021
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really.

485
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,856
And what are we gonna tell 'em?

486
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:38,692
We'll tell them the truth,

487
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,193
I mean, that he was robbing you

488
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,237
and-and I shot him,
and that's that.

489
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:43,363
Yeah.

490
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,448
Tell 'em the truth.

491
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:46,825
I like that.

492
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,870
Since he was threatening you,

493
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:52,122
I probably
won't get more than ten years, right?

494
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,832
And with good behavior

495
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:58,170
I could be out in seven... years.

496
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,176
Wait...

497
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:11,266
- Let's come up with another plan.
- What?

498
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,101
I mean, that he was robbing you

499
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,228
and somebody else shot him?
Who?

500
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,606
Well, we could say
that I shot him.

501
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,483
That won't work.

502
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:22,861
It's ridiculous,
it would never work that way, it's...

503
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:25,656
Well, maybe...

504
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,162
Well, I mean, let's...

505
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,872
Let's go over it.

506
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:34,998
Okay.

507
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,084
- He was robbing the place.
- Yes.

508
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,378
He did get shot, right?

509
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,380
So that's two out of three.

510
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,216
What's that,
that's sixty-seven percent true,

511
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,511
I mean, that's
pretty good these days, right?

512
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,137
Right.

513
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,106
That's some first date,
killin' her boyfriend.

514
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,901
Well, it gave
the relationship a certain intensity.

515
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:10,325
It all started one night at McCool's

516
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,244
Earl Raymond Pitts.

517
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,247
Had a list of priors
goin' back to the womb.

518
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,540
Seriously.

519
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:19,292
He was born in
Dwight Correctional.

520
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,693
His mother had twins
while she was doin' a bit for narcotics.

521
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:23,615
You mean
there's another one out there like him?

522
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,755
Yeah.

523
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,340
He went by the name "Utah."

524
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,719
"Utah"... The Mormon State?

525
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:30,178
Yeah. Don't ask me.

526
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,936
I'm a little unclear on this.

527
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,438
He was holding a gun on you,

528
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,106
But you were able
to get your gun

529
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:43,984
and shoot him point-blank
in the back of the head?

530
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,402
Yeah, right.

531
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,737
It-it all happened kinda fast.

532
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,280
So...

533
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,408
he was standing in front of you,

534
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,369
and then... what?

535
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,412
He heard something?

536
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,830
Right.

537
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,833
He turned around,
you grabbed your gun...

538
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,460
Right.

539
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,628
Which was where?

540
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,963
- Hidden next to the safe?
- Right.

541
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:08,342
Just in case
something like this ever happened.

542
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,969
He turned around,
you grabbed your gun, and pow!

543
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:14,014
Exactly...
That's exactly how it happened.

544
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,313
About what time was this?

545
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,940
About what time was this?

546
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,945
Just before I called 911.

547
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,074
Thanks.

548
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,494
Hey.

549
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,081
It's responsible citizens
Just like yourself

550
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,333
that make my Job a lot easier.

551
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,007
You can imagine my mood,

552
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:50,884
getting roused
from a sound sleep

553
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,887
to go scoop some citizen
off a barroom floor

554
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,611
- You wanna talk to the lady?
- What lady?

555
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,391
His.

556
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,685
Does she have
anything to do with it?

557
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,769
Nah, she was
waitin' for him back at their house,

558
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,062
he didn't show, she got worried,

559
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,856
came here lookin' for him.

560
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,483
Let her go.

561
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,859
Awright.

562
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,361
You're free to go, miss.

563
00:26:13,365 --> 00:26:16,952
Suddenly my whole life changed

564
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:24,668
Like Theresa had
come back from the dead

565
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,508
She even looks
a little like Theresa.

566
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:35,262
So this girl,
she's good in the sack?

567
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,180
I'm sorry, man, you get my age,

568
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,266
you like to hear
about the old un!

569
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,600
Sorry.

570
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:43,312
O-18, 1-8 under the "O".

571
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,689
Nice ass?

572
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,027
Mr. Chick Fife, telephone call.

573
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:52,821
Mr. Chick Fife, please
call your cardiologist.

574
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,032
You takin' the rap
for the shooting

575
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,867
musta worked out okay.

576
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,745
Your boss, he musta
treated you like a hero.

577
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,832
Oh, kid...

578
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:07,461
Death and good times,

579
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,296
they don't mix.

580
00:27:09,338 --> 00:27:11,465
I can't have people
comin' in here

581
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,758
lookin' for a good time,

582
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,051
seein' you and thinkin',

583
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,636
"-that's the one"

584
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,159
"that put a bullet
in the guy's head."

585
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:18,680
"Maybe he's gonna serve me"

586
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:20,365
"my strawberry daiquiri
and onion rings,"

587
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,933
"or maybe he's gonna
go postal on my ass!"

588
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,062
Joey, the guy was
tryin' to rob your bar.

589
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:26,647
He didn't take nothin'!

590
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,523
You put a bullet
in his friggin' noggin!

591
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:29,816
You're gone! Go!

592
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,279
Hello!

593
00:27:34,446 --> 00:27:36,615
Wh-what are you doin'?

594
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,242
What does it look like?
I'm ironing.

595
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,121
We're not there yet, are we?

596
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,622
What do you mean
we're not there yet?

597
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,292
We're movin' a little fast here, Jewel.

598
00:27:47,334 --> 00:27:49,670
- Yeah?
- Hi, how ya doin'. Need your signature.

599
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,422
- What's this?
- 1-800-Mattress.

600
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:54,758
I didn't order any mattress.

601
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,305
Dammit!

602
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:04,685
How are we supposed
to pay for this stuff?!

603
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,894
God, Randy, I Just thought

604
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:07,562
we really had something,

605
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,648
or at least the start of something.

606
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,692
But obviously
I'm incredibly stupid.

607
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,026
You're not stupid.

608
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,950
I'll be out of your life
in Just a few minutes.

609
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:16,685
I didn't say
I wanted you out of my life.

610
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,200
It's Just... with the ironing,

611
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:21,243
the-the new mattress,

612
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,910
they all Just seem like things

613
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,495
that are a little further
down the line,

614
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:25,956
that's all.

615
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,416
Further down the line

616
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,793
than all the sex
we've been having?

617
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:34,506
Any further down the line
than killing Utah together?

618
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:37,092
You're right...

619
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:39,135
you know what, it's me.

620
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,762
I lost my Job today.

621
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:44,808
You what?

622
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:46,351
I got canned.

623
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:51,315
Oh, baby, why didn't you say so?

624
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,151
Are you okay?

625
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,777
I guess.

626
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,746
Your cousin called.

627
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,706
The lawyer.

628
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,000
We're going over
to his house on Saturday

629
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,210
for a barbecue.

630
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,840
So Carl invites me
over to his house for a barbecue.

631
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,759
Now, Carl never invites me over,

632
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,011
so I'm thinkin'
to myself, why now?

633
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:29,727
Here you go.

634
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,354
That's sweet.

635
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,021
Thanks.

636
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,149
That is some
ma Jor league pussy.

637
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,319
I meant that in a good way.

638
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:39,571
You bangin' her?

639
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,698
She must have
fucked you senseless

640
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,492
when she found out
you shot a guy?

641
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:46,577
Because I read that
women cream for the violence.

642
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,080
I don't know what that is.

643
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,515
When you're fuckin' her, though,
because she's so young, is it...

644
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
I'm gonna see if
they want some helpin the kitchen.

645
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:53,377
I'm Just asking.

646
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,753
I mean, look at her!

647
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,713
It's like havin'
a porn star in my house!

648
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,632
Except she's makin' salad.

649
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,758
You have such
a beautiful house... it's so homey.

650
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,761
That's all Karen, believe me.

651
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,471
I wanted to go with
lots of stainless steel,

652
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,907
something we could Just
pssh! Hose it right off.

653
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,412
A lot of this stuff
we don't even use,

654
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:09,935
so if you really
like it, take it.

655
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,436
Thank you, Jewel.

656
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,815
It's always been my dream
to have a real nice house.

657
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,067
I already know exactly
what it'll look like...

658
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,028
Wall-to-wall carpeting
with matching drapes,

659
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:23,031
and a big, fluffy white couch,

660
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,242
nice dining room set,

661
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,869
and in the corner...

662
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,621
a fountain.

663
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:36,378
A fountain?

664
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,754
It's gonna be...

665
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:38,839
It's gonna be great.

666
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:41,883
It's of a little girl
washing her hair

667
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,260
and the water runs off
into a giant sea shell

668
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,430
with goldfish swimming in it.

669
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,684
I didn't Just make it up,
I saw it in a magazine.

670
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,060
Better Homes and Fountains?

671
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,353
Carl!

672
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:55,814
Hey, Randy, you got a fountain
in your place, don't ya?

673
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:56,857
In the living room...

674
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,318
Oh no, that's a leaky toilet.

675
00:30:59,401 --> 00:31:00,860
My mistake.

676
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:03,113
You know what, Carl?
You're not funny... Just rude.

677
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:05,657
- Let's get together some time.
- That's a good idea.

678
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:06,825
Bye.
Hey, c'mon.

679
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:12,789
Okay, okay!

680
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:13,999
Okay.

681
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,294
Why don't you
let Carl run you home?

682
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,670
No, I'm afraid
that's where your luck runs out.

683
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,007
I can't drive,
I've been drinkin'.

684
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:23,800
Would you buy a car?

685
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,135
One of these days.

686
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,095
Make him buy a car, would ya?

687
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,304
Let's go catch that 4:15 bus,

688
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:29,931
Let's get the hell out of here.

689
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:31,933
Buy a car...

690
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,227
I wish he hadn t
put that idea in her head

691
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,151
What's this?

692
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:45,781
A friend of mine's
goin' away for a little while...

693
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,035
So she said I could borrow it.

694
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,578
Well, what happens
when your friend gets back?

695
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,456
We're gonna be used
to havin' a car by then.

696
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,624
So?

697
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,501
- Then we're gonna have to buy one.
- So?

698
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:59,670
It's a bottomless pit
of expenses!

699
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:03,048
You got insurance,
you got repairs, car payments...

700
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,008
You're Just afraid
because now you don't

701
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,803
have an excuse
for not finding work, aren't you?

702
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,389
Stop right there,
this has nothing to do with work.

703
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,630
Did you know it's safer to fly

704
00:32:11,655 --> 00:32:13,015
than it is to drive a car?

705
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:14,518
You're upset with me

706
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,352
Because I didn't
bring you home a plane?

707
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:18,062
Another thing, if you think

708
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,356
I'm gonna be out there

709
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:20,941
with a hose and a bucket of suds

710
00:32:20,983 --> 00:32:23,423
to wash the damn thing,
you can forget it... I'm not that guy.

711
00:32:23,448 --> 00:32:25,444
Well, fine.
I'll wash the car.

712
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:27,072
God, you're full of shit.

713
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,824
What's that?
I'm full of shit?

714
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,117
Yes.

715
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:31,602
Lemme tell ya...
I have seen people

716
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:33,704
leave the bar so drunk
they can't even see,

717
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,997
and off they speed

718
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,790
in their giant
sports utility vehicles.

719
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,293
Well, you run into
one of these guys out on the street,

720
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:42,004
and you're gonna die,
and you're gonna die ugly!

721
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,880
Would you relax?

722
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:47,759
Christ, look at this house!

723
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,890
I come at a bad time?

724
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,350
No.

725
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,146
And then that damn detective dropped in

726
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,773
As if I wasn t
stressed-out enough

727
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:02,941
I'll let you two talk.

728
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,484
What'd he want?

729
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,987
You know, he's a cop.

730
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,281
They're never satisfied

731
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:11,325
unless they ask you
everything ten times.

732
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,076
After that night at McCool's
I was a mess.

733
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:16,997
I couldn't concentrate...

734
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,583
I couldn't sleep...

735
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,626
I could barely eat.

736
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:24,795
Nothin' deep-fried, anyway.

737
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:26,590
I had this longing...

738
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:31,219
Something inside of me said
I had to see that woman again

739
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,101
Boy, was I glad I got there
at that exact moment

740
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,480
He was getting very abusive

741
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:44,775
You're gonna die,
and you're gonna die ugly!

742
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:49,029
It was like I had been chosen
for a very special assignment

743
00:33:49,154 --> 00:33:53,200
Not by the department,
but by a higher power

744
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:56,370
I was being sent
to save her from him

745
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,916
Did I... come at a bad time?

746
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:02,584
No.

747
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,754
Didn't seem possible,

748
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:09,675
but she was even more beautiful
than the night I first saw her.

749
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,719
And I said, Good afternoon,

750
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:16,890
then she said,
I'll let you two talk

751
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:18,766
Then he said...

752
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,310
Not bad?

753
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:23,145
There was something about him
I Just didn't like.

754
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,266
According to your statement,

755
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:26,233
you closed the bar at one-thirty.

756
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,568
You didn't call
to report the shooting

757
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:30,237
until three-fifty-eight.

758
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,601
I need to know what you were doing during
that time frame.

759
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:35,158
Haven't we already
gone over all this stuff, man?

760
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,493
Hey, Jewel, how about

761
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,829
crackin' me open a brew?

762
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,331
I don't know, it was,

763
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,374
I had to count all that money,

764
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,626
It was a busy-ass night, awright?

765
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:46,920
I think on this night

766
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:48,588
we had those frat boys in there,

767
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:50,090
and a couple of 'em...

768
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,050
whaddya doin'?

769
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,385
This guy's a cop.

770
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,220
He can't drink, he's on the Job!

771
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,889
Why don't ya do somethin',
y'know, make yourself useful.

772
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,473
All right.

773
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,476
I'll be outside...
Washing the car.

774
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:02,978
Yeah, you do that.

775
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:06,440
Man, I'm sorry about her.

776
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:11,862
How can I not
question our Creator

777
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:14,739
for putting this...

778
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,118
human obscenity
into the presence

779
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,829
of such a...

780
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:22,956
divine creature.

781
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:26,168
Anyway, that was the night
we had all these frat boys in

782
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:28,086
and they're taking "the plunge."

783
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,339
A couple of 'em
ended up in the bathroom

784
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,008
and barfin' up
all over the floor...

785
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,970
I wasn't listening
to a word he was saying

786
00:35:37,095 --> 00:35:41,683
I could only think about her

787
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,352
I felt so guilty,

788
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:46,688
like I was betraying
the memory of Theresa

789
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:49,483
but I couldn t
take my eyes off her

790

00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,083
Can you imagine how I felt?

802
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,130
You should see
what she does with my hose.

803
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,131
I don't know what would make me

804
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:56,717
invite him over for barbecue.

805
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,885
You did say you were going to.

806
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:00,970
Yeah, but...

807
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:02,973
I say a lot of things.

808
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,641
Why do you think you did?

809
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,351
I don't know.

810
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,269
You tell me.

811
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,563
The woman?

812
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:13,692
You know, he brings her

813
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,820
and shes wearing
this nothing of a dress,

814
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:19,823
its a slip!
I mean, you can see everything

815
00:37:19,948 --> 00:37:21,408
For a barbecue.

816
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,785
No, no, wait a second,
what am I thinking? Hot pants.

817
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,996
They re like cupping everything,

818
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:27,789
and-and this top...

819
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:30,333
You could definitely
see her stomach

820
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,461
Wait! No, no no...
Sorry, it was a dress.

821
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:34,545
It was a dress, like a,
like a summer kind of

822
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,257
farmer girl dress, you know?

823
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:39,051
With like, cherries and plums and...

824
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:40,801
- Okay.
- Little fruits.

825
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:42,554
Shes walking and shes bouncing

826
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,389
and the grapes and the melons,

827
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:45,873
and they're Just
ba-boom, ba-boom...

828
00:37:45,898 --> 00:37:46,850
That's fine, thank you.

829
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,102
She's so sexy, but pretty!

830
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:50,646
- Okay, all right!
- No!

831
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:52,522
All right!
That's enough!

832
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:57,193
I get the picture!
Let's Just go on with the story.

833
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,362
So then...

834
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,114
In any case,

835
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,199
the reason I called you was

836
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,034
you're one guy I can trust

837
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:07,119
in a situation like this.

838
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,665
I got a guy with a hole
in the back of his head

839
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,416
where the exit wound was...

840
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:17,881
<i>♪ Were you Just
pleased to see me ♪</i>

841
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,843
<i>♪ As you all know ♪</i>

842
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,221
<i>♪ You better take care ♪</i>

843
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:25,889
<i>♪ Treat me with respect ♪</i>

844
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:28,684
<i>♪ Because love is rare ♪</i>

845
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,019
<i>♪ As you all know ♪</i>

846
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:33,230
<i>♪ You better beware ♪</i>

847
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:37,234
<i>♪ Treat me with respect... ♪</i>

848
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,070
Would anybody care
for another burger?

849
00:38:40,112 --> 00:38:42,071
I'll have a hot dog.

850
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,615
If you have one.

851
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,036
And then she grabs me
and she says,

852
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,871
Lets get together sometime

853
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,542
So she was coming on to you?

854
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,835
Yeah.

855
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,962
It doesn't surprise me, really.

856
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,213
It doesn't.

857
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,632
No, 'cause...

858
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,756
I mean, I don't mean
to sound full of myself, but...

859
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:05,200
But what?

860
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:07,889
You're irresistible?

861
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:11,518
Women...
women find me attractive.

862
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,105
Do you think
I'm attracted to you?

863
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:16,732
Well, you're a doctor,

864
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:19,067
so I think you have
that professional reserve.

865
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:20,694
But even so,

866
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,570
I think I felt something
when I walked in the office.

867
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:23,851
It's okay, don't worry about it.

868
00:39:23,876 --> 00:39:25,407
You don't wanna
hear about all this.

869
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:27,159
No, no, no... go on, go on.

870
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,201
You got the car,

871
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:30,911
you're feelin' good
about yourself again,

872
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,414
and boom!

873
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:35,459
The sex picks up again, right?

874
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:39,254
Well, not exactly.

875
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,590
I was watchin a lot of cable

876
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,052
Randy!

877
00:39:47,846 --> 00:39:49,305
Randy.

878
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:51,266
Can we talk?

879
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:52,600
Sure.

880
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,102
What did you do all day?

881
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:57,314
I'm watchin' this
Norwegian movie again,

882
00:39:57,356 --> 00:39:58,689
Maria Marushka

883
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,776
It's really good.

884
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:03,320
Randy.. I think not having a Job

885
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,364
is starting to get to you.

886
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:08,449
No. It's not having any money
that's starting to get to me.

887
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,619
Well, that is why
I think we need to talk.

888
00:40:10,702 --> 00:40:12,496
With what they pay me
at the store

889
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:13,821
we can barely cover our bills,

890
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:16,166
not to mention
the new dinette set I want,

891
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,126
or the window treatments
I want in this room.

892
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:20,128
Well, I'm sorry,
there's not much more I can do.

893
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,673
I mean, nobody
seems to be hiring.

894
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:24,883
That's why I went
to McCool's today

895
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,969
and spoke to
your old boss, Joey.

896
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,303
What!

897
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:31,306
You didn't go down there
and-and beg him

898
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,891
to give me my Job back!

899
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,142
Of course I didn't!

900
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:36,520
Good.

901
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:38,438
But I am going to
The Moody Blues with him.

902
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,815
- What?
- Tomorrow night.

903
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:42,359
He seems to think
they're the Second Coming,

904
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,276
but they're really
not my cup of tea.

905
00:40:44,277 --> 00:40:45,988
Wait a minute!
Why are you doing this?

906
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,865
I'm doing this for us
as a couple, Randy.

907
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:50,951
And more importantly,
I'm doing this for you

908
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,369
and your sense of self-worth.

909
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,582
I think that you have
a lot of anger towards Joey,

910
00:40:57,666 --> 00:40:59,543
and that because of that,

911
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,210
you feel less of a man

912
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,463
because of his power
to take away your livelihood.

913
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,048
You think I'm gonna
have less anger

914
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,676
and feel like more of a man
if you start dating this guy?!

915
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:09,136
No.

916
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,265
I'm suggesting
that tomorrow night

917
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,850
when you know
he's at the concert,

918
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:16,143
you go to his house

919
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,853
and you steal
everything of value

920
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:20,022
you can fit into our car.

921
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,189
You're Joking.

922
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,399
No.

923
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:26,445
I mean, come on,
the guy fired you.

924
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,865
And he still owes you
six hours overtime, right?

925
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:33,118
I Just don't think he knows
what he had with you.

926
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,786
You're so wonderful,

927
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,164
You're the best bartender
I've ever seen, by far.

928
00:41:37,247 --> 00:41:40,584
You know, the way
you worked those crowds,

929
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,462
you really had 'em
in the palm of your hand.

930
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,088
You know what
you reminded me of?

931
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:46,048
What?

932
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:49,509
A rock star.

933
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:50,761
Really?

934
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:52,554
Really.

935
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,475
I don't know...

936
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:01,188
I Just...

937
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,315
I don't see myself
doing something like that.

938
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,483
It's crazy.

939
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,609
Once we fence all his stuff,

940
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,210
we'll make a pretty nice
chunk of change.

941
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,030
Look, forget it!

942
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:12,156
There's no way.

943
00:42:12,157 --> 00:42:14,201
Absolutely not.

944
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:17,954
But you did it, of course.

945
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:20,457
Yeah, I did it.

946
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:32,552
I knew Joey would have
A big CD collection

947
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,182
And I was surprised at all
the other cool stuff he had

948
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:46,817
You know, Jewel must have taken

949
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:49,319
a few more psychology courses
than me,

950
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,947
because as crazy as I thought
the whole idea was,

951
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,033
as reluctant as I was to do it,

952
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:57,577
by the end of the evening,
I felt great

953
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,750
I still wonder how
she talked me into it.

954
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:06,712
Here's a wild guess.

955
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:11,758
Yeah.

956
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,593
That probably had
somethin' to do with it.

Jewel?

970
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,514
The Indian stays.

971
00:43:59,598 --> 00:44:01,974
I wasn't gonna throw him away.

972
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:03,060
For a while there,

973
00:44:03,185 --> 00:44:05,145
we almost seemed
like a normal couple

974
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,021
You're slammin it night and day,

975
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:10,233
poppin' your cork
like a bartender at a mob wedding,

976
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,319
then one day, like it always happens,

977
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:14,571
all that good nookie turns sour on ya.

978
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:16,156
Yeah.

979
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,823
What are you doing?

980
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:19,242
Oh, nothing. Trash.

981
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:21,703
Randy, come on,

982
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:23,496
we have to throw
some things away.

983
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:25,624
But not my Sno-Globes, come on!

984
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,210
Can't we Just compromise
and throw one Sno-Globe away?

985
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,212
Jewel, these came from my mom.

986
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:32,255
See this one here?

987
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:33,924
She brought it back
from Chicago.

988
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,218
See, it's got
the Sears Tower here,

989
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:39,596
and this one here
is very special.

990
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,307
Ya see, my mom used to say that

991
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,059
this was our house,

992
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,894
and as long as I never broke it,

993
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:48,563
we'd always have
a place to stay.

994
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:52,192
I knew
s he was only Joking, but still...

995
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,240
You're a sick puppy, man.

996
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:01,743
So what kind of Job
do you have at this point?

997
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:04,371
I hadn't got one yet.

998
00:45:04,413 --> 00:45:07,124
It was sort of
an ongoing problem between us.

999
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,126
I-29, I-2-9.

1000
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:13,504
I was offered
the lunch shift at TGI-Friday's...

1001
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,465
You lucky stiff.

1002
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,344
I actually thought
it was kind of a step down

1003
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,054
from unemployment, I mean...

1004
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:24,308
No, you got it, you won... I-29.

1005
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,726
Oh yeah.

1006
00:45:28,562 --> 00:45:30,564
Bingo.

1007
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,818
We have a winner!

1008
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,738
I gotta be honest
with you, my young friend.

1009
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:39,948
I'm leaning towards
the girl on this one,

1010
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:42,034
I mean, she's made your dump
nice and livable,

1011
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:43,952
you're gettin'
good action on the mattress...

1012
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,121
Hold onto it till you cash out.

1013
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:48,874
Least you could do
is make some money.

1014
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,834
Maybe you should be
playin' bingo.

1015
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,586
That's why...

1016
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:55,005
we decided to do another...

1017
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:58,050
you know, break-in.

1018
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,635
What do you mean, "we"?

1019
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:01,178
Yeah, Jewel and me,

1020
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:02,971
I mean, I'm no criminal.

1021
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,891
I bet he's got a DVD.

1022
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:07,142
I'd love to have one of those.

1023
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,852
We're going to Montague's,

1024
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,271
so I borrowed something

1025
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:13,148
from the designer section
at the store.

1026
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,650
I Just think
you might have overshot,

1027
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:17,486
I mean, even for Montague's.

1028
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:18,487
Really?

1029
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:19,237
Yeah.

1030
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,574
You know...

1031
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:26,536
maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

1032
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:27,954
The burglary?

1033
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,207
- Yeah.
- Oh, Randy!

1034
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,541
Joey's is one thing,
but this is something else.

1035
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:35,879
Would you be happier
if we weren't?

1036
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:38,215
Sure, wouldn't you?

1037
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:41,468
I'll show you
what makes me happy.

1038
00:46:49,685 --> 00:46:52,354
These are all
pictures from magazines,

1039
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:53,647
things I've saved.

1040
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:57,150
Things that I want
in my house someday.

1041
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,860
I've been carrying this thing

1042
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,279
around with me for years.

1043
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:05,659
Whenever I feel lonely
or get depressed,

1044
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:08,244
I Just add in a new couch

1045
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:11,373
or a new set of drapes and...

1046
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:13,500
I don't know, Just dream.

1047
00:47:15,294 --> 00:47:18,004
It makes me happy
to think that someday

1048
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:20,966
I might actually
live in the kind of house

1049
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:23,427
that looks like
it belongs in a magazine.

1050
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:28,724
You want me to be happy,
don't you, Randy?

1051
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:30,142
Of course I do.

1052
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:38,233
So who was it this time?

1053
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,776
Just some guy...

1054
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,653
God knows how they met

1055
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,406
They were going to some
fancy restaurant, Montagues

1056
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:01,381
Jewel was sure
she could keep him there

1057
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:03,257
for at least three hours

1058
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:04,551
It was a good thing, too,

1059
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,385
because it was gonna
take a little time

1060
00:48:06,386 --> 00:48:09,765
to clean this guy out...
He had everything

1061
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,821
At first I couldn't find
his DVD player,

1062
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:28,742
and I really needed to,
since Jewel wanted one

1063
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:36,458
So I went upstairs,
and there it was

1064
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,168
DVD!

1065
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:41,880
Bingo!

1066
00:48:44,716 --> 00:48:45,884
Him again?!

1067
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:50,222
You gotta be careful
when you say "bingo" in here.

1068
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:52,432
Not to worry, that was a false alarm.

1069
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:53,475
Sorry.

1070
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,479
It was like some game show

1071
00:48:57,521 --> 00:49:00,691
where they send you
on a shopping spree

1072
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:03,610
I found a nice new Rolex...

1073
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,113
Much nicer than my old Swatch.

1074
00:49:06,238 --> 00:49:09,992
Unfortunately,
this guy was I guess a midget

1075
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:20,668
And then things
started goin wrong

1076
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:22,295
What's this?

1077
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:24,297
This is the place
where it all happens, baby.

1078
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:25,424
Come on.

1079
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:26,466
Mi casa, es su casa

1080
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:29,177
Greg! I thought we were
going out somewhere!

1081
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,262
Why go out, baby?

1082
00:49:30,345 --> 00:49:31,805
We got it all right here!

1083
00:49:31,888 --> 00:49:33,432
Best sound system
you ever heard,

1084
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,517
a little hot tub,
swimming pool...

1085
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,439
The Gregster might even
break out his secret stash

1086
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,107
of blow.

1087
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:43,358
Greg...

1088
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,986
I thought...

1089
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:50,615
Why don't we
Just drive for a little longer,

1090
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,701
this car makes me so hot!

1091
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:59,249
I'll leave the front door open
if you wanna follow me, okay?

1092
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,402
Greg?

1093
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:28,570
Score!

1094
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:32,324
Oh, shit!

1095
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:34,451
Greg?

1096
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:40,499
Greg?

1097
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:46,463
Greg!

1098
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,887
Randy!

1099
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:04,314
I had a feeling
you'd find your way.

1100
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,316
This is a nice house.

1101
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,318
Too bad you're such a shit.

1102
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:11,530
A little dirty-talker.

1103
00:51:11,613 --> 00:51:14,032
Okay, okay, come on, let's talk.

1104
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:16,618
Why don't we go downstairs
and have a drink?

1105
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:19,246
I have a better idea, baby.
Let's talk after.

1106
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:21,331
Bitch!

1107
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:23,208
Come on, baby, come on!

1108
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,501
Get off me!

1109
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:33,719
Bitch.

1110
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:36,680
You like it a little rough?

1111
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:39,182
Oh, yeah, you wanna play?

1112
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,228
We'll play rough.

1113
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,523
We'll play very...

1114
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:09,004
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this.

1115
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:15,427
What is it with you?

1116
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,262
Everywhere you go,
there's a dead guy.

1117
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:18,472
Take the DVD.

1118
00:52:20,182 --> 00:52:21,642
Take the DVD!

1119
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:25,520
I'm not takin' the DVD.

1120
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:26,647
Why not?

1121
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:28,315
Well, I don't know,

1122
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,275
it Just does n't seem right.

1123
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:31,693
It was all right before?

1124
00:52:31,777 --> 00:52:35,614
Before there wasn't
a dead guy lyin' on the floor.

1125
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:37,991
Y'know, I never
saw a dead person till I met you.

1126
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:39,534
The guy was trying to rape me,

1127
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,911
does that mean anything to you?

1128
00:52:41,036 --> 00:52:41,953
Now take the DVD!

1129
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,996
I'm not takin' the DVD!

1130
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:46,625
Don't you want to live
in the type of house

1131
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,127
that has a first-rate
home entertainment center,

1132
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,629
including a DVD?

1133
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:52,297
I already got his big-screen.

1134
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:54,716
I don't see the difference
between taking his big-screen

1135
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,344
or taking his DVD...
I want that DVD.

1136
00:52:57,469 --> 00:53:00,597
'Cause the big-screen
is already down in the car.

1137
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:06,269
I get all dressed up,

1138
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,896
I get a friggin' shiner,

1139
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:09,523
I don't get dinner,

1140
00:53:09,564 --> 00:53:10,983
and I don't get the DVD...

1141
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:15,696
I didn't care about the TV,

1142
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,656
I was Just doin this
to make Jewel happy

1143
00:53:17,739 --> 00:53:20,199
But you didn't take the DVD.

1144
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,286
A local attorney
was found slain this morning...

1145
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:25,747
I do not believe we were in that
gazillion-dollar house

1146
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:27,499
and we didn't end up
with a thing.

1147
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,252
Did you forget
about the dead guy on the floor?

1148
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,712
No, I did not forget about
the dead guy on the floor,

1149
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:34,798
but we're not
talking about him right now,

1150
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:37,509
we're talking about the dead guy
on the floor's stuff,

1151
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,011
and he had a lot of stuff,
stuff we could have taken

1152
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,096
if you weren't such a chickens hit.

1153
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:43,140
What's that?

1154
00:53:43,181 --> 00:53:45,892
So now
I'm a chicken shit, is that it?

1155
00:53:45,934 --> 00:53:49,395
Yes, I believe that's
the technical term for what you are.

1156
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,983
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be a chicken shit

1157
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,068
than whatever
the hell is it that you are.

1158
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,790
I'm the woman
living with the chicken shit.

1159
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,322
Not for long.

1160
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,865
Yeah, not for long,
that's right,

1161
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,076
because I need a real man,
someone I can count on,

1162
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,370
not a chicken shit like you.

1163
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,623
Good, company.

1164
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:13,045
Thus far, police have no leads...

1165
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:18,550
It's that cop!

1166
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:21,470
Aren't you glad we don't have

1167
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:23,764
a lot of stolen stuff
lyin' around now?

1168
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:30,937
You're a genius.

1169
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,190
- Hi.
- Morning.

1170
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:34,608
Thought you'd wanna know

1171
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,850
we closed the investigation
on the shooting at McCool's,

1172
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:38,070
no charges will be filed.

1173
00:54:38,153 --> 00:54:40,073
We're gonna let you slide
on the unregistered gun

1174
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:41,948
'cause it was self-defense.

1175
00:54:42,074 --> 00:54:43,033
Thanks.

1176
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,909
Everything okay, ma'am?

1177
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,037
Yeah. Sure.

1178
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,623
Those are some
pretty nasty bruises.

1179
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,628
Oh yeah, she... had an accident.

1180
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:56,045
Accident?

1181
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,382
Would you mind if I
talk to her for a minute?

1182
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,800
Sure.

1183
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,386
Alone?

1184
00:55:02,427 --> 00:55:04,054
Okay.

1185
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:11,561
At the time, I was glad
Jewel was gonna talk to him

1186
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:13,647
She knew how to handle the cops,

1187
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,315
what to say to get rid of em

1188
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:17,943
She was good that way

1189
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:26,075
Whatever happened in there,

1190
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:28,202
she doesn't want
to talk about it.

1191
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:30,205
That's 'cause nothing happened.

1192
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:32,127
What we do in these
domestic violence situations

1193
00:55:32,207 --> 00:55:33,916
is ask you to
vacate the premises.

1194
00:55:33,917 --> 00:55:35,544
What domestic violence?!

1195
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:37,787
I will go to a Judge who will
issue a restraining order

1196
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,870
which means you are not
allowed on this property...

1197
00:55:39,895 --> 00:55:40,674
This is my house!

1198
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:43,197
Or within 100 yards of your wife
until this matter is settled.

1199
00:55:43,222 --> 00:55:44,553
She's not my wife!

1200
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:47,264
That's too bad...
You'd have more rights if she were.

1201
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:49,099
You expect me to Just walk away?

1202
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,344
If you don't, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to arrest you.

1203
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:53,144
You can't be serious!

1204
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:56,023
This... this...
Can't I Just talk to her?

1205
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,148
I don't think that would
be wise at this time, sir.

1206
00:55:58,173 --> 00:56:00,944
Whatever she told you,
she's... she...

1207
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:02,529
It's not true,

1208
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:04,156
y'know, okay?

1209
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,536
Hey, Jewel, honey,
could you come out here, please?

1210
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:11,997
I could still book you
on the unregistered gun.

1211
00:56:12,164 --> 00:56:13,749
Hun!

1212
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,626
Jewel!

1213
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,794
Would you be kind enough
to tell the police officer

1214
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:19,795
that I didn't hit you!

1215
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:22,049
Would you please
tell the officer

1216
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:23,467
that I didn't
do anything to you?

1217
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,260
Don't make me use force, sir.

1218
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,307
Jewel!

1219
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,060
Jewel!

1220
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:46,865
I couldn't believe it

1221
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:54,373
I was so pissed at her
I thought I was gonna explode

1222
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:58,001
Well, I gotta admit,
she's not perfect.

1223
00:56:58,126 --> 00:56:59,294
Not perfect?!

1224
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:04,132
She's like this pure, delicate flower,

1225
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:06,050
I Just wanted to protect her.

1226
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:09,763
But she was
living with another man.

1227
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:13,225
That piece of slime?
He didn't deserve her.

1228
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:15,268
And you did?

1229
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:17,771
I don't know.

1230
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:20,607
Oh, Charlie.

1231
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:23,443
I was totally consumed by her.

1232
00:57:23,568 --> 00:57:25,862
My every thought was of her.

1233
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:29,116
I was walkin' around in a haze.

1234
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:30,367
People talked to me,

1235
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:31,994
but I didn't hear
what they were saying

1236
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,578
Gregory Potter Spradling.

1237
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:37,748
A lawyer at
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.

1238
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:39,293
What did he do?

1239
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:41,086
"Do"?

1240
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:43,213
For a living.

1241
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:46,300
Lawyer. Ragsdale,
Hersch & Klein.

1242
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:47,759
It doesn't make sense.

1243
00:57:47,884 --> 00:57:49,970
Why would you go
to all the trouble

1244
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:53,223
of stealing a big-screen TV
and leave a DVD behind?

1245
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:54,558
Poor guy

1246
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:56,768
The only thing
goin through my head

1247
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:57,978
was her

1248
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,230
Everything okay, ma'am?

1249
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:02,357
Yeah. Sure.

1250
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,153
Those are some
pretty nasty bruises.

1251
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:09,072
Would you mind if I
spoke to her for a minute?

1252
00:58:09,197 --> 00:58:10,866
Knock yourself out.

1253
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,786
Charlie, what is it?

1254
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,538
Why would God fill me
with this desire

1255
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,415
If I wasn't
meant to be with her?

1256
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,921
Sometimes some time apart
is the best thing.

1257
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,843
I could arrange that.

1258
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:32,429
Would I get to
stay in the house?

1259
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:34,181
A temporary restraining order

1260
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:37,476
would keep him way
for... 90 days.

1261
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:40,020
But permanently?

1262
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:42,105
You'd have to get a lawyer.

1263
00:58:42,189 --> 00:58:44,566
Do you know one?

1264
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:48,861
Yeah. I know one.

1265
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:49,780
She called you?

1266
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:51,573
Yes... I didn't call her.

1267
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:53,784
She tells me things
are going badly with Randy,

1268
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:56,536
so I thought
maybe I could help her out

1269
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,664
and introduce her to
one of the guys in my office.

1270
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:01,124
In fact, I did, I once introduced her
to this other attorney,

1271
00:59:01,249 --> 00:59:04,502
Greg, who's this...

1272
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:06,254
guy who was murdered.

1273
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:11,802
Anyway, she Just knew
that Karen and I were having problems.

1274
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:12,970
Were you?

1275
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:14,846
Yes, you could say that.

1276
00:59:14,972 --> 00:59:16,515
Sexual problems?

1277
00:59:16,556 --> 00:59:18,433
Hey, you know...

1278
00:59:18,517 --> 00:59:20,644
Okay, if you want
to label it, yeah.

1279
00:59:20,686 --> 00:59:23,146
But I'm not saying
it's Karen's fault.

1280
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:25,399
Was it your fault?

1281
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,485
Maybe it was Karen's fault.

1282
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:31,780
Was there sex between
you and this woman?

1283
00:59:33,907 --> 00:59:35,200
Yes.

1284
00:59:36,451 --> 00:59:39,329
You want it now, lawyer boy?

1285
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:41,372
Yes! Yes, please!

1286
00:59:41,373 --> 00:59:42,332
Oh, my God!

1287
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,959
Oh, my God!

1288
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,127
Oh, my God!

1289
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,796
What happened there?

1290
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:49,214
Wh-why'd we stop?

1291
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,633
What?

1292
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:54,052
I need to ask you for a favor.

1293
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:55,595
Anything at all... anything!

1294
00:59:57,889 --> 00:59:59,516
I'm gonna need
some legal advice soon.

1295
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,809
You got it!

1296
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:02,311
You got it.

1297
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:04,563
- You aren't Just saying that?
- You got it.

1298
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,440
You want this? You like it?

1299
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:07,857
Can you help me?

1300
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:09,942
- Anything!
- Say it!

1301
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:11,445
I will give you legal advice.

1302
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:14,114
- Say it!
- I will give you legal advice!

1303
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:15,782
Say... it!

1304
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:18,035
I'm saying, I will give you
legal advice.

1305
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:20,620
- Yeah?
- Whooah!

1306
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:22,581
- She whipped you?
- Yes.

1307
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:24,875
- With a whip?
- Yes.

1308
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,293
And you en Joyed it?

1309
01:00:28,211 --> 01:00:29,421
Yes.

1310
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,843
Charlie I spent so much time

1311
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,219
going by her house,

1312
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,764
if you didn't know
my intentions were pure

1313
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:41,223
you d think I was stalking her

1314
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:42,726
Hello.

1315
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:46,563
Hi.

1316
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:49,524
I looked for any excuse
to go see her

1317
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:51,401
I spoke to a friend of mine

1318
01:00:51,443 --> 01:00:53,487
about helping you
with keeping the house.

1319
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:54,905
Good. Thanks.

1320
01:00:54,946 --> 01:00:56,490
I Just

1321
01:00:56,531 --> 01:00:58,742
wish I had known a bit sooner.

1322
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:02,079
See, I already sort of contacted
this other lawyer.

1323
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,414
Well, if you'd rather use him...

1324
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:07,292
It's Just that I'm not sure if I can
get my retainer back.

1325
01:01:08,543 --> 01:01:09,878
Well, lawyers...

1326
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,464
They'll always try to
find a way to screw you.

1327
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:14,257
Yeah.

1328
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:17,301
Well, I-I better...

1329
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:18,762
- I...
- Yeah?

1330
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:21,431
I was making some supper...

1331
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,642
If you'd like to...

1332
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,686
It's nothing special.

1333
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:30,816
Surely this was the hand of God.

1334
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:33,610
How do you mean, Charlie?

1335
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:36,696
In an instant I was transformed
from a broken man, made whole.

1336
01:01:36,697 --> 01:01:39,616
It was like Theresa
had been brought back to me

1337
01:01:39,658 --> 01:01:41,702
She even looked like Theresa...

1338
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:44,538
The way she moved,

1339
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:46,289
The way she smiled

1340
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:53,046
<i>♪ Her skin is like velvet ♪</i>

1341
01:01:55,507 --> 01:02:00,262
<i>♪ Her face cut from stone ♪</i>

1342
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:06,268
<i>♪ Her eyes when
she's smiling... ♪</i>

1343
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,270
- Can I help you with that?
- No thanks.

1344
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:10,564
I'll be right back.

1345
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:13,525
She even made linguini
with tomatoes and onions

1346
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:15,193
like Theresa used to

1347
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:17,154
Linguini with
tomatoes and onions.

1348
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:18,238
Jeez.

1349
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,159
What's that?

1350
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:23,577
Nothing.

1351
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,913
Probably Just a cat
got into the garbage.

1352
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:29,082
- Bread?
- Thanks.

1353
01:02:29,124 --> 01:02:30,959
How come you never
wear a uniform?

1354
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:32,669
I'm a detective.

1355
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:34,671
Sometimes I do, it depends.

1356
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:37,758
I bet you look real good in it.

1357
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,845
I couldn't wipe
the goofy smile off my face

1358
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:45,057
I was so happy

1359
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:46,767
Because of her I lost my Job,

1360
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,393
I lost my house,

1361
01:02:48,518 --> 01:02:51,980
I'm an accessory
in not only one, but two murders.

1362
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:56,693
I couldn't stop thinking about her

1363
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,029
Okay, maybe I wasn t
allowed on the property,

1364
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:01,740
but that didn't mean I couldn t
keep an eye on her

1365
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:11,625
And then

1366
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,795
she did something
that sent me over the edge

1367
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:20,676
I knew I had to do something

1368
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,678
something drastic to salvage

1369
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:25,180
what little I had left

1370
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:32,646
I got the ten thousand.

1371
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:34,563
Bingo parlor, right?

1372
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:35,983
Yeah.

1373
01:03:36,108 --> 01:03:37,025
The code is,

1374
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:40,445
I say, "It looks like we might
get some rain"...

1375
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,239
We came up with a code.

1376
01:03:42,322 --> 01:03:44,950
I said, "Looks like
we might get some rain"...

1377
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:46,952
Yeah, yeah, I know this part.

1378
01:03:46,994 --> 01:03:48,996
Yeah, right.

1379
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:50,580
You slept with
Randy's girlfriend?!

1380
01:03:50,622 --> 01:03:53,583
I mean, it's not like
I never did anything for him.

1381
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,836
He called and he
needed ten grand,

1382
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,462
so I advised him for free,

1383
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:58,797
I advised him
how he could borrow

1384
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,762
against that old crappy house
his mom left him.

1385
01:04:00,787 --> 01:04:02,050
You're missing the point.

1386
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:05,178
How did you feel after you slept
with your cousin's girlfriend?

1387
01:04:05,262 --> 01:04:07,139
He's not even a cousin, really,

1388
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,474
He's my uncle's wife's brother's kid.

1389
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:12,602
So he's not a blood relative
or anything.

1390
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:14,438
Did she ever call
and ask for legal advice?

1391
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:16,648
No. No. I keep waiting.

1392
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:18,859
It's like she's teasing me.

1393
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,777
I'm dying to give her legal advice.

1394
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:24,197
I Just seem to be thinking
about her more and more

1395
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,866
Excuse me.

1396
01:04:25,907 --> 01:04:28,118
There's a police detective
here to see you about Greg.

1397
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:29,995
Sure.

1398
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:31,663
Thanks.

1399
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:33,332
Sorry about the mess,

1400
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:34,957
I'm in the middle
of changing offices.

1401
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,711
How well did you know
Greg Spradling?

1402
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,796
Not that well,

1403
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:42,549
we worked here for
the last four or five years.

1404
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:44,926
You were both up for the same promotion,
weren't you?

1405
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,677
No, not...

1406
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:48,805
Not really.

1407
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,140
Greg was a good guy...

1408
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:52,683
No disrespect for the dead...

1409
01:04:52,684 --> 01:04:54,603
Not really partner material.

1410
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:56,980
So no matter who I'm talking to,

1411
01:04:57,105 --> 01:04:58,857
she's Just... she's on my mind.

1412
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:01,276
Can you think of anything
that might be useful to us

1413
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,527
in our investigation?

1414
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:06,907
Sounds to me like he
picked up some rough trade.

1415
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:09,993
Who knows what happened?

1416
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:13,579
There could have been...

1417
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,415
leather.

1418
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,461
There could have been
some bondage...

1419
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:23,714
Maybe those spiky things...

1420
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:26,760
Maybe some whipping.

1421
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:33,183
Could have been pretty kinky.

1422
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:38,146
But we all know
what that's like, right?

1423
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,607
No sir, I don't.

1424
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,360
That's how much
she messed me up.

1425
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:46,113
I mean, I'm being
investigated for a murder,

1426
01:05:46,196 --> 01:05:47,990
and all I can
think about is her.

1427
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:50,117
- And the whip?
- Yes.

1428
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:52,786
There was another reason
I went to see her that day.

1429
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:04,423
Something had come up at work

1430
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:07,592
The shoe prints we found
on Winfield road

1431
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:09,886
turned out to be
Converse All-Stars,

1432
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:12,806
the same brand
the boyfriend wore

1433
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:15,100
And if he was there,

1434
01:06:15,267 --> 01:06:18,729
there was a chance
she might have been

1435
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:23,567
I had the same sick feeling
in my stomach

1436
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,694
that I had when I was
waiting for The results

1437
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:28,530
to come back from the lab
at the hospital

1438
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:32,951
Unfortunately, her print did
match one at the murder site

1439
01:06:33,035 --> 01:06:37,873
That scum,
that boyfriend of hers

1440
01:06:37,998 --> 01:06:40,208
There's no telling
what he forced her to do

1441
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,836
before I came along...
I wasn't going to let her

1442
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:45,547
get dragged into
a murder investigation

1443
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:48,550
I knew she had
nothing to do with it

1444
01:06:48,634 --> 01:06:51,345
There's something
I have to ask you.

1445
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:54,473
Is it an inside question
or an outside question?

1446
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:57,643
There was a burglary last week
on Winfield Road.

1447
01:06:57,809 --> 01:06:59,686
A man was killed.

1448
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:01,104
Was she able to convince you

1449
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:03,815
that she didn't have anything
to do with it?

1450
01:07:06,777 --> 01:07:12,574
She was very convincing

1451
01:07:12,658 --> 01:07:14,451
It was a miracle!

1452
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,370

01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:35,347
There was sex?

1458
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:39,101
God help me, It was wonderful.

1459
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:41,895
No, for me to help you,

1460
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,398
I-I need to hear everything.

1461
01:07:44,523 --> 01:07:46,858
See, you have to
tell me all about

1462
01:07:46,942 --> 01:07:50,278
the-the-various acts
of physical congress between...

1463
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,197
I already told you that.

1464
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,157
Okay, no, that's fine,

1465
01:07:54,282 --> 01:07:56,576
I'm not... it doesn't...

1466
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,787
I shouldn't have done that.

1467
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:00,956
It's okay, I wanted to.

1468
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:06,169
Are you going to arrest Randy?

1469
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:08,964
I've got a warrant
out for him now.

1470
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:11,466
That car he's driving is stolen.

1471
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:13,718
Add a murder charge to that

1472
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:17,138
and you won't see him for a long time.

1473
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:21,268
So I'll get to keep the house.

1474
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,689
This...

1475
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:29,234
This is all I have left.

1476
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:38,327
How not perfect
can one woman be?

1477
01:08:38,410 --> 01:08:41,287
Aces in the boink department.

1478
01:08:41,288 --> 01:08:43,498
Got yourself a snazzy new watch.

1479
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:45,792
Like this is supposed
to make everything better?

1480
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:47,461
But you gotta admit,
that's a beaut.

1481
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:49,588
Here's the money, Just take it.

1482
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:52,049
Take it. Take it!

1483
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,301
Kid... easy, easy.

1484
01:08:54,384 --> 01:08:56,428
Would the owner of
a blue Geo Metro

1485
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,848
Missouri license plates
87KP03 please report

1486
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:01,475
to the front desk.

1487
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,644
Is that my car?

1488
01:09:03,769 --> 01:09:06,229
You got any idea what they want?

1489
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:07,731
No.

1490
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,274
Is there any possibility
that she might have...

1491
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:12,402
- Stolen?
- Yeah.

1492
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:14,738
I want to remind everyone

1493
01:09:14,863 --> 01:09:16,323
that Saturday is "Hawaiian night."

1494
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:18,617
She gave me a stolen car.

1495
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,953
Women are much more complicated
than we think they are.

1496
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:24,081
C'mon, let's get out of here.

1497
01:09:24,164 --> 01:09:26,333
We'll get back to the game

1498
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,216
as soon as the troopers
finish their business.

1499
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,629
Sir, is this your car?

1500
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:32,297
That piece of shit?

1501
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:34,841
Officer, what do I look like?

1502
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:39,388
You know, to tell you the truth,

1503
01:09:39,513 --> 01:09:41,722
she doesn't sound worse
than most of 'em.

1504
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:43,599
But you'll do it, right?

1505
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,644
Business is business.

01:09:57,072 --> 01:09:59,574
What do I think?

1512
01:09:59,616 --> 01:10:02,327
The flesh is weak...

1513
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:06,123
But ours is a forgiving God.

1514
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,374
But I destroyed evidence

1515
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:12,045
I withheld information
for a murder investigation

1516
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:13,046
Charlie, look...

1517
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:15,340
You deserve some happiness.

1518
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:19,011
The kind of happiness that a...

1519
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:22,389
a good woman can bring a man.

1520
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,519
Yes, I have this great Job

1521
01:10:27,602 --> 01:10:29,282
and this great office
and this great family

1522
01:10:29,307 --> 01:10:30,230
and this great house...

1523
01:10:30,314 --> 01:10:31,606
How does this make you feel?

1524
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:33,233
Empty.

1525
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,651
I feel nothing.

1526
01:10:34,818 --> 01:10:36,987
And who knows,
it happened so fast.

1527
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,590
I mean, here's this guy
in my office...

1528
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,133
what is he,
thirty-five years old...

1529
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:41,741
And he goes like that.

1530
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:43,577
I could walk out of your office

1531
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:45,120
and get hit by a truck.

1532
01:10:45,162 --> 01:10:47,247
I don't want to live like that anymore.

1533
01:10:47,289 --> 01:10:49,124
Let me Just feel something, anything,

1534
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:52,085
and then I will look up
and I will say,

1535
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:56,173
"Thank you, God.
Thank you for that gift."

1536
01:10:56,256 --> 01:11:00,761
And... then if the truck
wants to get me, then okay.

1537
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:03,013
And then I meet this woman.

1538
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:06,892
She makes me feel...

1539
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,069
Thank you.

1540
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:21,198
I'm sorry.

1541
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:24,159
Have you acted on your desire
to see this woman again?

1542
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:27,204
Do you think I should?

1543
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:30,998
Time's up.

1544
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:32,209
What?

1545
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,627
Sorry, time's up.

1546
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:35,462
What, are you kidding me?

1547
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:37,798
- Are you Joking?
- Your time's up.

1548
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:40,217
Do you think I should see her?
Just tell me that!

1553
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,730
Could be Boise or Boston.

1554
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:55,190
Point is, she ain't
anywhere around.

1555
01:11:55,273 --> 01:11:57,484
Check in, you get yourself known.

1556
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:00,529
Go out, talk to the clerks in stores,
waitresses, the works.

1557
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:02,572
- You got a calling card?
- Yeah.

1558
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:04,741
Make some long distance calls.

1559
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:07,244
Anything to prove you've
been here for a couple of days.

1560
01:12:07,369 --> 01:12:09,621
- Awright?
- Gotcha.

01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:21,591
Oh, yeah.

1564
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:26,263
There it is.
Ten thousand dollars.

1565
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,224
You're not gonna count it?

1566
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:30,684
Nah.

1567
01:12:30,726 --> 01:12:32,060
You trust me?

1568
01:12:32,185 --> 01:12:34,938
No. But I do kill people.

1569
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:36,189
Right.

1570
01:12:36,231 --> 01:12:38,275
I'll be callin' by seven.

1571
01:12:39,318 --> 01:12:41,153
You think I'm a bad person?

1572
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,160
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1573
01:12:48,285 --> 01:12:50,287
Would you like to
try our new fragrance?

1574
01:12:50,329 --> 01:12:51,037

1575
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:52,456
No thanks.

1576
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,708
Hi sir. Would you like
to try our new fragrance?

1577
01:12:54,791 --> 01:12:56,084
No thanks.

1578
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,043
Yeah?

1579
01:13:38,168 --> 01:13:39,920
Hey buddy, It's me, Randy.

1580
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:42,214
Hey, I was Just talkin'
to somebody about you.

1581
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,215
What... what's up?

1582
01:13:44,216 --> 01:13:45,926
Not a whole hell of a lot.

1583
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,552
I'm Just here in Collinsville.

1584
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:50,055
Jewel and I needed a little time
away from each other.

1585
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:54,059
So, so she didn't go with you?

1586
01:13:54,142 --> 01:13:55,727
No, man.

1587
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:58,689
So she's... She's home,

1588
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:01,608
she's all by herself now?

1589
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:05,320
Jewel and I had a little bit of a tiff.

1590
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:08,657
Good. Spend a coupla days away
and let things cool off.

1591
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:11,326
And you know what?
Thing's will work out fine.

1592
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:13,078
- Do you really think so?
- Absolutely!

1593
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,038
Okay.

1594
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,748
Stay there! Okay.

1595
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:23,171
- Are you all alone?
- Are you heartbroken?

1596
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,340
Did something happen
to the romance?

1597
01:14:25,424 --> 01:14:26,967
Did things get out of hand,

1598
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:29,636
and now you're afraid
they've gone too far?

1599
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,014
Are you about to lose
that someone special forever?

1600
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:34,349
If you are one of the
97 out of 100 men

No, I don't want
to talk to the kids.

1618
01:16:50,407 --> 01:16:51,486
Can you Just tell them?

1619
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:52,821
Don't-don't put them on.

1620
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:55,866
You don't have to...
Hi, Sweetie!

1621
01:16:55,907 --> 01:16:59,453
No.
Daddy's not gonna be home.

1622
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:02,288
What do you mean?

1623
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:04,415
Well, how did the dog get out?

1624
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:05,959
Well, where's his leash?

1625
01:17:21,933 --> 01:17:23,935
Okay, Daddy's gotta...

1626
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:25,896
Daddy's gotta go.

1627
01:17:26,063 --> 01:17:27,343
Dad, don't...
Okay, Sweetheart.

1628
01:18:21,034 --> 01:18:22,202
Cosmetic department, please.

1629
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:24,371
Cosmetic department!

1630
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:26,373
Bye.

1631
01:19:40,614 --> 01:19:42,866
You can't Just
barge into somebody's house!

1632
01:19:42,908 --> 01:19:44,868
Keep your hands up, Scummo.

1633
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:46,620
You are in big trouble.

1634
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:47,702
You need a search warrant.

1635
01:19:47,746 --> 01:19:48,914
I happen to be an attorney.

1636
01:19:48,955 --> 01:19:49,956
I Just made partner

1637
01:19:49,998 --> 01:19:52,249
at the second-largest
law firm in the state.

1638
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,794
That's where
I've seen you before.

1639
01:19:53,835 --> 01:19:55,128
You need a search warrant.

1640
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:57,130
This is my girlfriend's house!

1641
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:00,217
Bullshit! This is
Randy Weltzer's house.

1642
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,760
He happens to be my cousin.

1643
01:20:01,927 --> 01:20:03,387
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1644
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,430
And as his attorney,
I can assure you

1645
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:08,933
that he will be
filing a suit against you

1646
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:11,061
and the entire
St. Louis Police Department.

1647
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,146
Well, I guess it'll be
right after he stands trial

1648
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,469
for the murder of your former associate
Gregory Spradling.

1649
01:20:15,494 --> 01:20:17,025
Wh-what?!

1650
01:20:17,109 --> 01:20:19,111
Are you crazy?

1651
01:20:19,152 --> 01:20:21,989
Mister, you better take a good long
look in the mirror

1652
01:20:22,114 --> 01:20:24,074
before you call
somebody else crazy.

1653
01:20:24,199 --> 01:20:26,076
Get your clothes on.
I'm takin' you in.

1654
01:20:26,118 --> 01:20:27,743
Okay, for what?

1655
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:29,079
For murder.

1656
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,564
You and Spradling were in competition
for the same position.

1657
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:34,250
So you and your...

1658
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:37,212
gay incestuous lover killed him.

1659
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:38,672
What?! No...

1660
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:40,424
First of all, I am not gay.

1661
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:42,551
Interesting choice of wardrobe, then.

1662
01:20:42,634 --> 01:20:44,511
I'm married, with two kids.

1663
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,139
I'm so not gay,

1664
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:49,308
I'm here to fuck
my cousin's girlfriend.

1665
01:20:49,349 --> 01:20:50,767
I oughta shoot you right now.

1666
01:20:50,809 --> 01:20:52,060
He's not really my cousin,

1667
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:53,854
he's my uncle's wife's
brother's kid.

1668
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:54,604
That's enough!

1669
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,398
Come on, hey!

1670
01:20:56,481 --> 01:20:58,066
Freeze! Freeze!

1671
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:01,862
You're making
a very big mistake.

1672
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:05,157
You better watch it, buddy,
I am an attorney!

1673
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,244
Get down!

1674
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:11,830
You're making
a very serious mistake!

1675
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,124
Shut up!

1676
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:18,629
You're in big trouble!

1677
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:20,422
Okay, here she is.

1678
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:22,174
She'll clear up
this whole thing.

1679
01:21:22,299 --> 01:21:25,510
What are you doing here?!

1680
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:27,220
Carl...

1681
01:21:27,346 --> 01:21:28,805
What's goin' on?

1682
01:21:30,557 --> 01:21:32,476
It's not what it looks like.

1683
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:35,228
Why are you wearing that?

1684
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:36,980
Like you don't know.

1685
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:38,106
Hey, I'm not the one

1686
01:21:38,148 --> 01:21:40,901
who's got him
bent over the table.

1687
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:43,236
This is official
police business.

1688
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,280
Carl, what are you doing here?!

1689
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:46,530
Where is Jewel?

1690
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:50,035
It was Just that one time
with me and Jewel, I swear.

1691
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,287
What do you mean, one time?

1692
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,206
You're lyin'.
She never let you touch her.

1693
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:57,084
Yeah, not like you,
her "boyfriend."

1694
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:59,367
Do you believe that?
He calls himself Jewel's boyfriend!

1695
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:00,435
I'm warning you.

1696
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:01,546
Where is she?!

1697
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:03,632
I was expecting her
here any minute!

1698
01:22:03,715 --> 01:22:06,259
Why do you think I'm dressed like this,
for Halloween?

1699
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,625
You're dressed like that
because your perverted cousin...

1700
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:10,681
Wait a minute.
We gotta find her!

1701
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:13,084
You are violating a restraining order
and are under arrest!

1702
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:14,476
You don't understand.

1703
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:16,602
Someone is coming here
to kill her!

1704
01:22:16,603 --> 01:22:17,437
Him?

1705
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:20,732
No.

1706
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:35,747
Which one of you homos

1707
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:37,541
killed my brother?

1708
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,543
I'm not gay...

1709
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,419
Shut up!

1710
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:44,298
I understand the man
that killed my brother, Utah,

1711
01:22:44,423 --> 01:22:45,339
he lives here.

1712
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,633
And I'm not leaving
'till I kill him.

1713
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:49,720
Now, which one of you was it?

1714
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:52,847
I said, which one of you

1715
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:54,308
was it!?

1716
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,978
I-I-I'm an attorney.

1717
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:01,231
I'm sure you and your brother
were very close... that's good.

1718
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:04,234
Avenging his death,
wanting to avenge his death,

1719
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,193
that's admirable,
who doesn't understand that?

1720
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:08,405
But as a lawyer...

1721
01:23:09,614 --> 01:23:11,115
What the hell?

1722
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,701
You want to explain to me

1723
01:23:12,784 --> 01:23:14,077
what you're doing

1724
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,330
looking through
the window of my house?

1725
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:17,914
Give me your gun.

1726
01:23:19,499 --> 01:23:21,668
I lost my dog...

1727
01:23:21,835 --> 01:23:23,086
He came off his leash.

1728
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:40,562
And you need a .357 for that?

1729
01:23:40,604 --> 01:23:43,523
Well, it's
a rough neighborhood...

1730
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,651
Jewel.

1731
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:49,196
You should know that.

1732
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:54,034
Look at these guys.

1733
01:23:54,117 --> 01:23:55,577
Legally, you're swimming

1734
01:23:55,661 --> 01:23:57,204
against the current here,

1735
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:58,913
but you've got
think about the fact

1736
01:23:58,914 --> 01:24:00,791
that if you kill
all three of us,

1737
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:02,225
you will be adding here,
and I'm Just guessing,

1738
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,793
a second and possibly
third strike

1739
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:05,212
to your record.

1740
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:06,313
Which would be heading you

1741
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:08,006
to some very serious prison time.

1742
01:24:08,882 --> 01:24:11,718
You I'll kill
Just for annoying me.

1743
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:13,971
Now, I would appreciate

1744
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:16,431
if the man that
killed my brother Utah

1745
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:19,017
would step forward
and take responsibility

1746
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:20,352
for their actions,

1747
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:23,271
or I will have no other choice

1748
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:26,274
than to kill all you damn...

1749
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,151
Village People!

1750
01:24:28,276 --> 01:24:31,321
Now... somebody

1751
01:24:31,363 --> 01:24:33,781
better damn well

1752
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:37,160
start talkin'!

1753
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:20,620
Lord, please don't let them
find me in this outfit!

1754
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:45,729
Aaahh!

1755
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:10,791
I'm really gonna
miss that little house.

1756
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:12,918
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1757
01:28:12,946 --> 01:28:14,186
When I'm on the road a few days

1758
01:28:14,211 --> 01:28:15,754
I really miss my place.

1759
01:28:15,837 --> 01:28:17,964
You have a house?

1760
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:20,842
Oh, yeah... I'm a real homebody.

1761
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:24,054
Nothin' I like better than stayin' home
on a quiet night

1762
01:28:24,179 --> 01:28:27,057
watchin' a good movie on my DVD.

1763
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:29,393
You have a DVD?

1764
01:28:30,894 --> 01:28:33,438
If you're gonna have a first-rate
home entertainment center,

1765
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:35,148
you gotta have a DVD.

1766
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:42,614
Not that my place doesn't need
some fixin' up.

1767
01:28:44,616 --> 01:28:47,577
Hell, I was even thinking
about putting in a fountain.

1768
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:50,872
Yeah.

1769
01:29:05,053 --> 01:29:06,763
Thank you, God!
