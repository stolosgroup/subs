00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,018
<i>I didn't really have
your typical upbringing.</i>

4
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:56,789
<i>I mean, I did at first,
but then the world ended.</i>

5
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:58,590
<i>I don't think anyone
was really shocked.</i>

6
00:00:58,723 --> 00:01:02,126
<i>We always thought it might,
and then it just finally happened.</i>

7
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:05,932
<i>But how it happened,
now that's where it gets interesting.</i>

8
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>Agatha 616.</i>

9
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:10,434
<i>Yep, an asteroid
heading straight for Earth.</i>

10
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:12,237
<i>I know. So obvious.</i>

11
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,906
<i>So, humanity came together,
and we did what we do best.</i>

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,575
<i>We shot a bunch
of rockets at it!</i>

13
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:18,843
<i>And we blew it up!
And it was great!</i>

14
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:22,112
<i>But it wasn't. You see,
the thing that makes rockets rockets...</i>

15
00:01:22,246 --> 00:01:23,816
<i>chemical compounds,
a lot of 'em.</i>

16
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:27,319
<i>Which rained back down on us,
and everything changed.</i>

17
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:29,820
<i>And by "everything,"
I mean cold-blooded creatures.</i>

18
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:33,290
<i>And by "changed," I mean mutated
and started eating us to death.</i>

19
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:39,031
<i>Ants, lizards, roaches, crocodiles.
You name it. There's a lot of 'em.</i>

20
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:47,705
<i>I knew this one kid who was eaten in his
sleep by a goldfish he won at a carnival.</i>

21
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,242
<i>Man, Todd loved that goldfish.</i>

22
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,111
<i>And that cat.</i>

23
00:01:54,245 --> 00:01:57,015
<i>So, for most of human history,
if you wanted to kill a cockroach,</i>

24
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,551
<i>all you needed was a shoe.</i>

25
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,551
<i>Well, suddenly
you needed a shotgun.</i>

26
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:02,821
<i>And sometimes even a tank.</i>

27
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:04,822
<i>And sometimes
even that doesn't work.</i>

28
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:08,326
<i>Especially if you don't stay
in the tank, Bob.</i>

29
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,264
<i>Eventually, the really big ones and
our military took each other out.</i>

30
00:02:14,532 --> 00:02:19,304
<i>We lost 95% of the human
population in about a year.</i>

31
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,238
<i>That's a lot of Bobs.</i>

32
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,506
<i>And a lot of Todds.</i>

33
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:27,079
<i>Those of us who survived,
we hid anywhere we could...</i>

34
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,881
<i>bunkers, caves, panic rooms,
all around the world.</i>

35
00:02:31,015 --> 00:02:34,852
<i>So for the last seven years I've
been living in an underground bunker.</i>

36
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,022
<i>It's not as bad
as it sounds. Really.</i>

37
00:02:38,157 --> 00:02:41,527
<i>It's a great group of people,
and we all love each other.</i>

38
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:44,996
<i>It's kinda what I imagined
college would have been like.</i>

39
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,300
Are you sure he's asleep?

40
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:49,935
Who?

41
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:52,304
- Joel. Who else?
- Yeah. He's asleep.

42
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:55,140
- Hang on. Shh.
- He's not awake.

43
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:56,907
- Are you sure?
- It's just you.

44
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,843
I just... I don't...

45
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,379
Joel. Joel.

46
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,917
See?
He's not awake.

47
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,850
It's just you.

48
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,288
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am wide awake.</i>

49
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,691
<i>I've just gotten good at not
really moving or breathing.</i>

50
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:16,429
<i>Being stuck in a survival
bunker with a bunch of people</i>

51
00:03:16,562 --> 00:03:19,831
<i>who have all found their
soul mate is less than ideal.</i>

52
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,366
<i>Karen and Ray got together
a few months ago,</i>

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,536
<i>so they're still kinda
in their honeymoon phase.</i>

54
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:27,506
<i>It is super physical.</i>

55
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,777
<i>Good for them. They're both very
attractive and apparently quite flexible.</i>

56
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,478
<i>Hey, life's short.
Especially down here.</i>

57
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,448
- Oh. Hey, Ava.
- Hey, Joel.

58
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,751
- Joel. How's it going?
- It's going good, Tim.

59
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:42,721
- How are you... How are you doing?
- Yeah, good.

60
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,155
Cool.

61
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:47,658
- I couldn't sleep.
- Yeah, we know the feeling.

62
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,295
Yeah. Probably not
for the same reasons.

63
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:54,199
Y-You guys's, uh, door's open.
Is that... Did you know that?

64
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:56,268
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we know.

65
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,402
Okay.

66
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:00,139
<i>After Tim's parents were
eaten by a swarm of termites,</i>

67
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,807
- <i>he and Ava became inseparable.</i>
- Okay. Good night.

68
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,742
- <i>In every way.</i>
- Good night.

69
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,781
That's the asteroid
they named 616 Agatha.

70
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:11,716
And these are all the chemical
bombs they sent up to try and...

71
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,319
<i>So, pretty much
everyone's coupled up down here.</i>

72
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,723
<i>Our first baby was born last winter.
It was super emotional.</i>

73
00:04:17,855 --> 00:04:19,625
<i>Welcome to the apocalypse, kid.</i>

74
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:22,026
<i>The food sucks. At least you'll
never know what you're missing.</i>

75
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,530
<i>Kala and Connor got together
after Carol died.</i>

76
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:28,733
<i>Carol was a cow who ate a
box of laundry detergent.</i>

77
00:04:28,867 --> 00:04:32,304
<i>And now we only have one cow.</i>

78
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,672
<i>Her name's Gertie.</i>

79
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,274
<i>Gertie is great.</i>

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,175
<i>Gertie's not
our only food source.</i>

81
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,079
<i>We actually have a hunting
party that brings back</i>

82
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,947
<i>whatever they can
from the surface.</i>

83
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,151
<i>It was easier in the beginning, you
know, before we ran out of bullets.</i>

84
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,887
<i>Facing down one of those things
with a janky handmade weapon</i>

85
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,989
<i>is no walk in the park.</i>

86
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:52,324
<i>Or so they tell me.</i>

87
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:55,060
<i>I-I don't go
on the hunting parties.</i>

88
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:57,161
<i>They need me in the kitchen.
I'm kinda the, uh...</i>

89
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:59,129
<i>...the chef of the bunker.</i>

90
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,066
<i>Everyone likes my minestrone.</i>

91
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:06,069
<i>Being the only single person in
the bunker has its perks too.</i>

92
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:07,673
<i>I get to hang out with Mavis.</i>

93
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:11,276
<i>Of course, she's not much
for conversation anymore.</i>

94
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,846
<i>Her core battery's shot,
just like every other Mavis, I'd imagine.</i>

95
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,849
<i>Actually never seen
a working one.</i>

96
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:32,362
<i>Sure wish you were here, Aimee.</i>

97
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:34,699
<i>I'd love for you
to meet everyone.</i>

98
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,301
Oh, yeah.

99
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:38,903
<i>Maybe we could do a little
target practice together.</i>

100
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:40,839
<i>It's kinda my thing.</i>

101
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,209
<i>Well...</i>

102
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:47,345
Sorry, Mavis.

103
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,891
Hustle, hustle, people.
We gotta move.

104
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,596
Guys!

105
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:07,366
Guys! I got the weapons.

106
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:09,368
- Stay.
- What?

107
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:11,469
- Get what you need, and let's go.
- What's happening?

108
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,638
What's going on?

109
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,538
- We're breached.
- Breached?

110
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,240
- Joel.
- What do you mean?

111
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:17,676
Like,
inside the bunker breached?

112
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,377
That's what "breached"
means, kiddo.

113
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:23,547
Breached.

114
00:06:24,682 --> 00:06:27,485
Anna Lucia and I will engage.
Anderson and Tim, flank us.

115
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,889
Flank 'em, yeah, okay.
Where do you guys need me? The rear, or...

116
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:32,257
I thought
we were past this, Joel.

117
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,859
Past what?
You need help. I can help.

118
00:06:33,992 --> 00:06:35,994
- Let me help.
- You gonna make me say it?

119
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,663
- Say what?
- You can't handle it, Joel.

120
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,665
- You're shook.
- Okay, yeah.

121
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:43,435
- So, you guys don't get scared ever?
- We get scared.

122
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:46,237
We all get scared, Joel,
but you get really scared.

123
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,539
- We're not trying to make you feel bad.
- We love you, Joel.

124
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,907
But you're unsafe.

125
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,443
- You're a liability.
- Even on supply runs.

126
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:54,446
Okay, why did that speech
feel so rehearsed?

127
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,149
Connor.

128
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:01,186
Okay, 30 meters out. Let's move.

129
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,996
- Be careful, Connor-Bear.
- I will, Kala-Bee.

130
00:07:18,803 --> 00:07:20,505
Load out.

131
00:07:24,074 --> 00:07:26,077
Go with them.

132
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,622
They're getting close.

133
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:45,162
Shit.

134
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:46,798
Oh, my God.

135
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,468
- It's got one of 'em.
- What about the others?

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,002
They're coming back.

137
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:52,204
Joel!

138
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,738
They need help. I'm going.

139
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,975
Joel! Wait!

140
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,264
Connor?

141
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,667
Connor.

142
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,298
Did I shoot it, or did you?

143
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,235
What do you think?

144
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:06,370
You.

145
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,910
<i>Oh, and I have a pretty
severe freezing problem.</i>

146
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:14,712
<i>But I am working on it.</i>

147
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,562
- How is it looking?
- I think it looks really good.

148
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,263
- Does it look like me?
- Yeah.

149
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:35,834
Are you sure that
this pose looks natural?

150
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:37,335
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

151
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,437
I think it's really good.

152
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,339
What are you doing?
Don't move.

153
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:43,908
- Will you let me see it?
- Don't... Don't move. Aimee.

154
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:45,377
I really wanna see it.

155
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:47,077
Can I see it?

156
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,313
Okay.

157
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:51,014
Okay.

158
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,884
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,158
What do you think?

160
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,463
Why do I have a beard?

161
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,465
No, that's shading.
I did the shading.

162
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,233
My head is... is so large.

163
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:12,737
- You have a big head.
- And my hand is so tiny.

164
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,404
You have tiny hands.

165
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,075
I love it. I frickin' love it.

166
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:20,577
That's super sweet, 'cause it's terrible.

167
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,646
- I got you something too.
- What?

168
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,650
I don't know if
these are the right ones.

169
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:30,053
No way. These are the ones
that I-I-I wanted to get.

170
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:31,557
- Really?
- Yeah.

171
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,127
Ooh. Hello.

172
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,895
- What's happening right now?
- Uh...

173
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:41,032
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm dancing with my shoulders.

174
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,734
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,885
This has been the best summer
of my life.

176
00:12:01,852 --> 00:12:03,287
Mine too.

177
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,793
Uh-oh.

178
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,695
What are you doing?

179
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:14,965
- Do you know what time it is?
- Uh, I think it's, like, 6:30.

180
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,302
Aimee, you're...
you're scaring Crocodile Carl.

181
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,405
Okay, look away, Crocodile Carl.

182
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:23,240
Oh. Look away.
Hey, I get it.

183
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,875
I get it.

184
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,989
We need to go.

185
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,524
I'm scared.

186
00:12:55,706 --> 00:12:59,110
<i>Dear Aimee, This week
has been especially shitty.</i>

187
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:02,681
<i>We lost Connor to what
looked like a really big ant.</i>

188
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,418
<i>Helps me to draw them.</i>

189
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,486
<i>I try to capture their essence,</i>

190
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,057
<i>scribble down some notes
on how to kill them.</i>

191
00:13:14,158 --> 00:13:15,526
<i>Sometimes I think
it's the only way I know</i>

192
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,461
<i>how to cope with these things.</i>

193
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,702
This is 7045. Come in, 3022.

194
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:28,706
I repeat, come in, 3022. Over.

195
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,642
<i>This is 3022.
What is it now, Ray?</i>

196
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,945
Hey, Janice. No, it's actually...
It's, uh, Joel.

197
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:38,482
- <i>Oh. Joel.</i>
- Yeah.

198
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,418
<i>All right.
Hold on one second.</i>

199
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:42,552
<i>Aimee, it's Ray!</i>

200
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:45,023
It's Joel.
Thanks, Janice.

201
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:49,394
- <i>Joel! Hey!</i>
- Hey, Aimee! Hi!

202
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,763
- How are you?
- <i>Hi. Yeah, I, uh... I'm good.</i>

203
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,932
- It's so good to hear your voice.
- <i>I'm so sorry.</i>

204
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:58,336
<i>I heard on the open frequency
that one of you guys got killed.</i>

205
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,504
Yeah. Breached the bunker.

206
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:02,940
<i>Wow. Actually got inside?</i>

207
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:07,010
Yeah. It's the first time it's happened.
It was kinda scary.

208
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:09,346
<i>Did you have to fight it too?</i>

209
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,817
Yeah. Yeah, a little.

210
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,052
I had to fight it
a little bit.

211
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,820
Actually got super ripped since
the last time you saw me, so...

212
00:14:16,955 --> 00:14:19,424
<i>Oh. Wow!</i>
<i>Super ripped, huh?</i>

213
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:24,128
Yeah, I was kidding. I'm not super ripped.
That was just a bad joke.

214
00:14:24,261 --> 00:14:26,497
<i>Well, I'm glad you're okay.</i>

215
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,466
Thanks. Yeah.

216
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,204
<i>I am still kinda blown away that you were
even able to find my colony on this thing.</i>

217
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:34,871
I know.
It's pretty crazy.

218
00:14:35,005 --> 00:14:37,775
'Cause I found it on the first one.
What are the odds?

219
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:39,543
<i>Crazy.</i>

220
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:43,281
Yeah. No, I... I called...
I called, like, 90.

221
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:49,354
- Hey, you know what I, uh... know what I wish sometimes?
- <i>What?</i>

222
00:14:49,486 --> 00:14:53,924
That I could, like, s-snap my fingers
and be back in that car with you.

223
00:14:56,293 --> 00:14:57,728
Man, that'd be nice.

224
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,397
<i>Yeah. Too bad it's, uh...</i>

225
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,734
<i>you know, impossible.</i>

226
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:06,905
<i>Kinda feels like everything
is impossible these days.</i>

227
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:10,808
<i>Taking care of this whole
colony is exhausting.</i>

228
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,846
I, uh...
I-I write you letters.

229
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,516
<i>Really?</i>

230
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,485
Yeah. Yeah,
I-I write you letters sometimes.

231
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,855
- <i>Aw!</i>
- All the time.

232
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:26,157
<i>I'd love to read 'em.</i>

233
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,127
Really? I would love to read them to...

234
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,062
No. Aimee?

235
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:36,599
Aimee?

236
00:15:46,977 --> 00:15:49,814
<i>We've lost
a lot of people over the years.</i>

237
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,120
<i>You'd think you'd get numb
to it after a certain point.</i>

238
00:15:58,288 --> 00:15:59,723
<i>You don't.</i>

239
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:08,299
- I'm sorry.
- Thank God! Where have you been, Joel?

240
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,501
We have to go right now.
Say your goodbyes, get in the car.

241
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,304
- I should go.
- Maybe you should come with us.

242
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:16,908
No, my mom is waiting. I'm sorry.

243
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,210
Get in the car!
Aimee, you need to hurry home now!

244
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:21,779
- I want you to have this.
- What? This is Crocodile Carl.

245
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,346
It's your good luck charm.

246
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,216
- Be careful.
- You too.

247
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:36,027
Aimee.

248
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:39,264
I love you.

249
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:42,199
I love you too.

250
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,002
I'm gonna come find you.

251
00:16:46,136 --> 00:16:47,605
You better.

252
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:58,548
<i>You better.</i>

253
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:00,350
I wanna know how it got in.

254
00:17:00,484 --> 00:17:03,321
It appears to have ripped
through one of our perimeter defenses.

255
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,923
What,
it ripped through steel?

256
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,923
Anderson and I resealed
the breach point and the vent.

257
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:08,359
Nothing's getting
in that way again.

258
00:17:08,492 --> 00:17:09,594
But why did it happen?

259
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:10,961
It was a freak occurrence.

260
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,630
There's no reason to think
it'll happen again.

261
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:16,199
We should try to stay calm.

262
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,137
How far away is Aimee's colony?

263
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:21,972
- What?
- Aimee's colony.

264
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:25,377
- How far away is it?
- About 85 miles.

265
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:26,778
How long does that take
to get there?

266
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,813
You're not actually thinking
of going?

267
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:31,782
Tim, just... humor me.

268
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:36,153
- How long?
- Seven days. Minimum.

269
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:40,325
An armed and trained hunting party would
be lucky to last 50 miles on the surface.

270
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,826
But you, Joel...

271
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,028
All right, now I need volunteers

272
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:47,163
to help reinforce
some of the outer perimeter.

273
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:50,634
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

274
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:52,202
- Ava's got this.
- Exactly.

275
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:53,738
I'm gonna go.

276
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:59,144
It's an impossible journey,
Joel.

277
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,214
No, I'm serious.

278
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:08,318
I love you guys,
but there's one person in this world

279
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,320
who ever truly made me happy,

280
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,656
and she's only 85 miles away.

281
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,893
And I'm gonna go see her.

282
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,096
Whew.

283
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,097
That felt awesome.

284
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,866
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am done hiding.</i>

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,068
<i>I'm done waiting
for things to get better.</i>

286
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:27,904
<i>It's time to take matters
into my own hands.</i>

287
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:30,875
<i>Time to let someone else
make the minestrone.</i>

288
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:34,711
<i>I'm taking a radio, even though
it doesn't have power.</i>

289
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,381
<i>But I'm gonna take it anyway.</i>

290
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,283
Wish me luck, Gertie.

291
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,451
Mavis, take care of her.

292
00:18:41,586 --> 00:18:43,688
You're not joking,
are you?

293
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:46,057
Nope. Nope, I'm not.

294
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:48,092
He's not joking.

295
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,962
We're not letting you leave,
Joel. You're needed here.

296
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,964
Tim, no, I'm not. Come on.
I don't do anything.

297
00:18:54,098 --> 00:18:58,403
Joel, that's not true. You fix the radio.
You make the minestrone.

298
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:01,706
Okay.

299
00:19:01,838 --> 00:19:03,707
Doesn't sound as important
when I say it out loud.

300
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,675
I appreciate you trying.
Really, I do.

301
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:08,111
I just don't feel like
I belong anywhere.

302
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:11,682
I don't really wanna die all alone
at the end of the world, so...

303
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:22,125
Look, I know you guys all just think
of me as, like, some little, pathetic,

304
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,461
adorable hedgehog.

305
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,096
But I can take care of myself.

306
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,334
I'm actually probably a lot
stronger than you might think.

307
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:34,238
- We made you a map.
- Thanks, Karen.

308
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:40,577
Just... take care.

309
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,881
- Everything will try to kill you.
- Oh.

310
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:46,183
Be observant.
Use the advantages that you have.

311
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:48,719
- You're fast and small, so...
- Right.

312
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:51,722
- Don't fight. Just run and hide.
- Don't fight.

313
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,225
Thanks, Ray.

314
00:19:56,326 --> 00:19:58,829
You're an asshole
if you get eaten.

315
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:09,139
- Okay.
- Nice.

316
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,376
I love you guys. Tell Aimee
I'll see her in seven days.

317
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:14,878
- We believe in you.
- Love you, buddy.

318
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:05,663
Where am I?

319
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,964
Well, it's not super useful.

320
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,666
Okay, well, you know what?

321
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,269
We know we gotta head west.
Right?

322
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:15,772
Well, let's just... do that.

323
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:18,143
Start with something easy. West.

324
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:23,381
Nope, it's this way.
West is this way.

325
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:31,288
Shit.

326
00:21:31,422 --> 00:21:34,092
Split the difference.
Go this way.

327
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:37,060
Done. First decision made.

328
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,882
<i>Dear Aimee,
I am doing it.</i>

329
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,618
<i>I'm really doing it!</i>

330
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:04,055
<i>Honestly, I thought it'd be way worse.
So far, it's not too bad.</i>

331
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:07,692
<i>I've seen a lot of signs
of death, but no actual death.</i>

332
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,561
<i>So cross your fingers.</i>

333
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:12,896
Oh.

334
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:14,298
Monster eggs.

335
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:16,599
<i>Trying to stay positive.
Weather's nice.</i>

336
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:20,337
<i>Getting some fresh air.
What else can I tell ya?</i>

337
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,276
Cool.

338
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,879
Wham-O...

339
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:32,081
No.

340
00:22:32,215 --> 00:22:34,817
Run and hide.

341
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:38,355
Hide in the house.
Hide in the house.

342
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,879
No.

343
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:11,182
No, no, no. No!

344
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:14,085
No!

345
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:17,320
No, no, no!

346
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:20,457
Yes! Bite it! Bite it off!

347
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,908
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

348
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,675
Where are you going?

349
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,054
Whoa!

350
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,124
Whoa, that was so cool.

351
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,296
Nice place.

352
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,400
Can I sit?

353
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:07,437
Thanks.

354
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:13,876
You all alone?

355
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,778
Yeah.

356
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,280
Me too.

357
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:25,356
Boy?

358
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,726
Is that your name?
Boy? Your name is Boy.

359
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,429
I'm Joel.

360
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,065
Nice to meet ya.

361
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:38,702
Thanks, uh...
Thanks for saving my life, Boy.

362
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:48,211
Is this a dress?

363
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:51,114
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry.

364
00:25:51,248 --> 00:25:53,451
Okay, I won't touch it again.

365
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,387
Was that your owner's?

366
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:01,091
It's okay.
You don't have to talk about it.

367
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,793
Sorry.

368
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,831
Wait. Did you think I was her?

369
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:08,632
Huh.

370
00:26:08,766 --> 00:26:11,502
I'm gonna lie down too.
Is that o...

371
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:15,673
No, it's okay.
Just my backpack.

372
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:27,918
You know,
I had a girl, too, once.

373
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:31,020
Think you would've really liked her.
Yeah, you guys would totally get along.

374
00:26:31,153 --> 00:26:34,825
She loves dogs. I mean, all animals.
She's a big animal lover.

375
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:37,862
I haven't seen her
in seven years.

376
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:41,298
Long time. That's why
I'm trying to go find her.

377
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,870
I haven't told anyone this,
but I'm kinda nervous about it.

378
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,647
Good night, Boy.

379
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,901
Weakness: dogs.

380
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,439
That's you.

381
00:27:21,571 --> 00:27:25,107
You wouldn't happen to have a power
source to a ham radio in here, would you?

382
00:27:25,241 --> 00:27:26,844
'Cause I have a...

383
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,545
Never mind.

384
00:27:37,121 --> 00:27:39,456
Huh. Lipstick.

385
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:40,691
Aimee.

386
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:43,626
Hey, would you mind
if I kept this?

387
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,795
Thanks.

388
00:27:45,395 --> 00:27:48,097
All right, well... this is it.

389
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,166
Thanks for having me.

390
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,903
I should...
stop talking to a dog.

391
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,807
Okay. I'll see ya.

392
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,753
Okay.

393
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:14,658
Oh.

394
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,127
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no. None of that.

395
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,329
Something might hear you.

396
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:21,865
You wanna come with me?

397
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:24,634
Okay. You can come.

398
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,804
Let's go. Come on.

399
00:28:27,904 --> 00:28:29,472
Uh... What...

400
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:35,778
Yeah, we can bring that.
You want me to put it in my bag?

401
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,150
Okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna keep it safe. I promise.

402
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,256
Going in the safe backpack.

403
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:47,191
See?

404
00:28:47,324 --> 00:28:48,859
Okay, you ready?

405
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,128
Let's go. Come on.

406
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,831
Okay, that's really
gonna have to stop.

407
00:28:58,499 --> 00:28:59,971
Feels good, actually,
having company.

408
00:29:18,788 --> 00:29:20,624
<i>Dear Aimee, Guess what.</i>

409
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:23,794
<i>I got a dog, and he's the coolest.
His name is Boy.</i>

410
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,629
<i>He saved my life
from a giant frog in a pool</i>

411
00:29:25,761 --> 00:29:27,764
<i>who tried to eat me
with his tongue.</i>

412
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:30,699
<i>And then we hung out on his bus.
Man, do we make a great team.</i>

413
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:33,903
<i>We found out we have
a ton in common too.</i>

414
00:29:34,037 --> 00:29:36,105
<i>I feel like
we can talk about anything.</i>

415
00:29:37,273 --> 00:29:40,209
<i>You gotta see us out here.
We're like this iconic duo.</i>

416
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:43,980
<i>I don't know. Feels like when
we're together, we're unstoppable.</i>

417
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,084
Hey. What are you doing?
What you got in there?

418
00:29:48,618 --> 00:29:50,319
Oh, my gosh. Yeah. Go. Go!

419
00:29:50,452 --> 00:29:52,455
We gotta go! Come on!

420
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:02,333
Berries.

421
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:05,269
Sustenance. Perfect.

422
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:06,769
Ow. Ow!

423
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:10,441
Ow! What... What are you doing?

424
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,176
Uh...

425
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,547
But they look so good.

426
00:30:20,183 --> 00:30:22,720
Yeah, you know what?
I don't think I should eat these.

427
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:26,256
<i>It's crazy the things you forget
about the world. Like the smells.</i>

428
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,425
<i>The grass,
the trees, the flowers.</i>

429
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:30,661
<i>Sure, you get the occasional
bloody corpse, but...</i>

430
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:31,829
Aaah!

431
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:54,617
Oh, no.
I fell in a hole.

432
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:56,854
Okay, I just gotta...

433
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,455
climb out.

434
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,424
I can climb out.

435
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:12,036
Oh, no.

436
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,872
This is bad.

437
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,275
Oh, this is so bad.

438
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,511
Stop. Stop it. Shh. Stop it.

439
00:32:10,426 --> 00:32:12,428
It's a rope, you numbskull!

440
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,099
Put it around your foot
and grab on!

441
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:17,634
Okay, come on! Hold on!

442
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:20,170
Pull up!

443
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,782
You wanna look at 'em? Oh, shit!

444
00:32:33,616 --> 00:32:35,920
Uh...

445
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:38,221
Minnow, finish 'em off.

446
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:42,859
One, two, three, four and...

447
00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:48,531
Are we...

448
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,769
Always count to five.

449
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,670
Was that a samurai sword?

450
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:55,672
Why'd you fall
into a Sandgobbler's nest?

451
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:58,741
I didn't mean to, you know.
I was just... I was walking.

452
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,110
- What's your name?
- Joel.

453
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:02,512
Joel Dawson.

454
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm, uh, Clyde.
This is Minnow.

455
00:33:04,413 --> 00:33:07,283
You're lucky we weren't monsters.
You were yelling like a girl.

456
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,485
"This is bad! This is so bad!"

457
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:13,556
Okay, I don't sound like that.
My voice is not that high-pitched.

458
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:15,558
- Yeah, it is.
- Yes, it is.

459
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,861
It was higher than mine,
and I'm eight.

460
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:21,531
What in God's name are you
doing up here alone anyway?

461
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,766
I'm not alone. I've got Boy too.

462
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,802
Oh, wait, no! No, wait, wait!

463
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:28,672
Oh, my God, it's a puppy!

464
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,841
Come here, Boy!
Come here, Boy!

465
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:33,876
- They almost killed my dog.
- Hi, Boy!

466
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,913
Hi!

467
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:37,581
Hey.

468
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:40,582
So, uh, what happened
with your colony, man?

469
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,185
They kick you out?

470
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,320
No, I actually left on my own.

471
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:47,190
- Something I had to do.
- You stole food, didn't you?

472
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:48,792
- He's a food stealer.
- Yeah.

473
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:52,361
- No, I didn't steal any food.
- Right.

474
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,064
Me and my colony were really close.
Like family. Okay?

475
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:57,201
They were super upset
that I left.

476
00:34:01,605 --> 00:34:03,640
- Time to go, Minnow.
- Time to go? Why?

477
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:05,875
So, what...

478
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:08,144
What, uh... What was that?
What's going on?

479
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:11,648
- Could've been a lot of things.
- Tree Flamer. Herd Stomper.

480
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,215
Rockdiver.

481
00:34:13,349 --> 00:34:17,253
Limbsnapper. Limbcrusher.
And my favorite... the Chumbler.

482
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:20,590
Okay, I get it.
A lot of... A lot of names.

483
00:34:20,724 --> 00:34:24,327
Whatever it is,
it took your screams for the dinner bell.

484
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,596
If it's got your scent,
it's gonna be on you for a while.

485
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,335
Hey, maybe I could, like,
I don't know, come with you guys.

486
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:38,041
Which way you headed?

487
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:40,410
Going west.

488
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,978
To the coast. Jenner Beach.

489
00:34:43,112 --> 00:34:45,380
Yeah. We're not
cutting north just yet.

490
00:34:45,514 --> 00:34:48,817
- Not cu... Not cutting north just yet.
- Come on. Come on.

491
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:50,987
Yeah. Whatever you want.

492
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:53,222
You guys want me
to come, I'll come.

493
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:55,224
Come on.

494
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:17,847
That's a good, uh...
good little workout.

495
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:21,585
A girl, huh?

496
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,286
Yeah.

497
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,855
You left a nice, safe colony to
travel all the way to the ocean

498
00:35:25,989 --> 00:35:29,393
for a girl you ain't seen
since you were, what, 17?

499
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:32,862
No, I know what you're thinking.
I know how it sounds. It's crazy.

500
00:35:32,996 --> 00:35:34,530
But... I don't know.

501
00:35:34,664 --> 00:35:37,534
If you knew our connection,
you'd probably feel differently.

502
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:40,503
We actually just got back in touch
over the radio a few weeks ago.

503
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:43,740
And it's still there.
It's just magical. And so sweet.

504
00:35:43,873 --> 00:35:47,109
She loves me too, so a "pick up right
where we left off" kind of thing.

505
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:50,413
- It's still there.
- You ever hear the term "fool's errand"?

506
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:53,884
All right, what, so I'm a fool
because I believe in true love?

507
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:56,285
No, you're a fool
because you're out here alone,

508
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,856
you don't know a thing
about survival...

509
00:36:00,356 --> 00:36:01,291
Wind.

510
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:03,126
...you shoot for shit,

511
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:07,730
yet you got an attitude like
you're some kind of noble warrior

512
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:10,099
floating on the wings of love.

513
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:13,502
- Doesn't work like that.
- Okay.

514
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:16,105
Super encouraging speech.

515
00:36:23,512 --> 00:36:24,847
- Damn it.
- You're braining out.

516
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:27,918
- Huh?
- Braining out. Thinking too much.

517
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,355
I always clear my mind
and say to myself,

518
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,623
"a needle through water."

519
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:34,257
"A needle through water"?

520
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:37,494
Trust me. My dad was the
best archer in my colony.

521
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:41,864
Oh, really? Okay. Then how come he's
not the one giving me the lessons?

522
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,499
'Cause I'm not her dad.

523
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:45,601
Yeah, my dad got killed.

524
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,871
Back when we lived
in the subway station.

525
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,539
Along with Elliot.

526
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:51,440
Uh, wh-who's Elliot?

527
00:36:51,574 --> 00:36:52,909
My son.

528
00:36:53,876 --> 00:36:56,847
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No need to be sorry.

529
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:00,317
We all have stories like that.
Don't we?

530
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:08,358
Needle through water.

531
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,894
Needle through water.

532
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:17,733
Hey, that was pretty close.

533
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,203
- It was better.
- It was really good, right?

534
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,638
Right?

535
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:26,543
Tell you what, kid. You gonna hang with
us, you need to know stuff.

536
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,778
Yeah. Okay.

537
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:29,945
- First lesson.
- Yeah. Hit me.

538
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,481
Always survey from high ground
when possible.

539
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:33,750
- Always.
- Always.

540
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:35,318
Helps you spot the big ones
in advance.

541
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:37,320
It's nice to know that thing's
not following us anymore.

542
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:40,757
No, no, it's definitely still
following us. Just saw it.

543
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:42,424
- What...
- Yeah.

544
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:44,995
- Chumbler.
- I knew it.

545
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:48,097
- Big son of a bitch too.
- Big sumanabitch.

546
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,133
Got your scent too, man.

547
00:37:50,266 --> 00:37:53,536
- It's gonna be hard to shake.
- Then why are we still standing here?

548
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,005
Relax.
Chumblers aren't fast.

549
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,907
- We gotta keep moving.
- Mmm.

550
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:00,010
Should've already been gone.

551
00:38:01,311 --> 00:38:04,414
- It's got my scent.
- Oh, yeah, it does.

552
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:15,792
- Comin'?
- Yeah!

553
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,663
- Where you guys headed anyway?
- North.

554
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:21,964
- To the mountains.
- What's up there?

555
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,534
A, uh, place called
Snow Mountain Wilderness.

556
00:38:24,668 --> 00:38:27,938
Supposed to be some kind of
colony up there full of survivors.

557
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,839
The cold and elevation
help to keep the monsters away.

558
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,109
You should definitely
come with us.

559
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:34,878
Well, I would, but, you know...

560
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,945
You gotta go
find your girlfriend.

561
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,582
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh...

562
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,085
Minnow.

563
00:38:44,052 --> 00:38:45,721
If you knew her,
you'd really like her.

564
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:46,990
She's a super cool person.

565
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:48,557
Well, she's not gonna like you,

566
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,527
'cause you can't even get out
of a Sandgobbler's nest.

567
00:38:51,661 --> 00:38:54,930
And honestly, I just like you
'cause you have a really cute dog.

568
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:58,568
- Hurts my feelings.
- You're so useless.

569
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:02,873
It just means
she likes you, man.

570
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:05,474
She's, uh...
She's been through a lot.

571
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:08,443
Yeah.

572
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,614
So annoying.

573
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,884
- Joel.
- What?

574
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,085
Don't move.

575
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,355
- Oh, my God. Why?
- Give me your shirt.

576
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:20,422
My shirt? What do you mean?

577
00:39:20,556 --> 00:39:23,259
Your shirt, man.
Give me your shirt.

578
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,795
- Okay.
- Get... Hurr... Come on.

579
00:39:25,929 --> 00:39:28,731
- Do what he says, Joel.
- Give me your shirt.

580
00:39:28,865 --> 00:39:30,599
Shut up. I'm trying.

581
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,402
Easy. Take it easy.

582
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:35,271
- That's it. That's it.
- Is it a Chumbler?

583
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,473
- No.
- What is it called?

584
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:40,677
Take it easy. Lean over, man.

585
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,245
- If I don't make it...
- Shh, shh.

586
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:45,048
That's it. That's it.

587
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:48,617
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

588
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:51,421
Just stay very still.

589
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:54,958
- Okay.
- Shh.

590
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,259
Okay, buddy.

591
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:03,099
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Easy does it.

592
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:06,135
It's okay.

593
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,805
You're okay.

594
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:12,309
It's okay.
You're all right.

595
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:15,478
All right. Okay, now.

596
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:19,349
On your way.

597
00:40:19,782 --> 00:40:21,050
Okay, now.

598
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,888
All good. On your way now.

599
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,356
On your way.

600
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:31,627
Good boy. Good boy.

601
00:40:39,202 --> 00:40:41,805
What you so scared for?
Boulder Snails are nice.

602
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:43,840
There can be nice ones?

603
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,276
You can always tell in their eyes.
Just look at their eyes.

604
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:50,346
- This one probably saved our lives too.
- Saved our...

605
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,516
Gonna spread your scent
all over this hillside.

606
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,387
Shoot. That old Chumbler ain't
gonna know which way to go.

607
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,722
So the Chumbler's
gonna follow my shirt?

608
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,291
Thank you, Mr. Boulder Snail.

609
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:05,429
- Thank you, Mr. Boulder Snail!
- Thank you.

610
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:08,063
Yeah, they're
very sensitive, you know.

611
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:11,734
But they'll crush your ass...

612
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:14,471
in a second.

613
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:22,278
What you working on, man?

614
00:41:22,411 --> 00:41:26,681
Just a little project I started
a while back in my colony.

615
00:41:26,815 --> 00:41:31,453
Every time we encountered a new
monster, I'd just make a little entry.

616
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:32,822
Mm-hmm.

617
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:35,726
A drawing.
Um, just some info about it.

618
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:38,293
You know, strengths, weaknesses.
Stuff like that.

619
00:41:38,427 --> 00:41:40,896
Made me feel like
I was helping out, you know.

620
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,065
- You're a pretty good artist.
- Thanks.

621
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,935
- I seen this one. Ugly bastard.
- Yeah.

622
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,638
- Doesn't like loud noises.
- Oh, yeah.

623
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:51,875
Also doesn't like
shotgun blasts to the head.

624
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,708
Might wanna add that.

625
00:41:54,242 --> 00:41:56,278
Shotgun to the face.

626
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,779
- Yeah. Got it.
- Oh.

627
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,849
- Do you mind if I...
- Oh, sure.

628
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:02,150
Yeah. Oh, thanks. Thanks.

629
00:42:02,652 --> 00:42:04,887
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

630
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:06,923
I was 16 when it hit.

631
00:42:07,056 --> 00:42:09,525
Yeah, they sent everything
up at once to take her down.

632
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,195
They had the balls
to call us the lucky ones

633
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:15,664
just 'cause whatever the hell was
in those things didn't affect us.

634
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:20,070
Ain't nothing lucky about getting
kicked off the top of the food chain.

635
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:24,541
Yeah, my parents thought if we
could just make it out of Fairfield,

636
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:26,007
we might have a shot.

637
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:27,710
Wait, wait, wait.

638
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,980
You're from Fairfield?

639
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:33,215
Yeah. Why?

640
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,019
Man, I've never met anyone
who made it out of Fairfield.

641
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:41,090
That place
was basically ground zero.

642
00:42:41,224 --> 00:42:44,661
Shit, I've only heard
horror stories.

643
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:47,864
Yeah,
it was pretty bad.

644
00:42:47,996 --> 00:42:49,699
Your parents, uh...

645
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,601
Oh, uh, no.

646
00:42:51,733 --> 00:42:54,804
No, it's just me.

647
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:59,342
Couldn't save 'em.

648
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:02,112
You putting that on yourself?

649
00:43:02,577 --> 00:43:04,413
Mmm.

650
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:07,250
You're from Fairfield, man.

651
00:43:07,382 --> 00:43:09,585
You shouldn't even be here.
Right?

652
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:12,722
You're more of a survivor
than I thought.

653
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,594
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

654
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:21,097
It's a good start.

655
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:25,635
Keep it up. Book like this could
save someone's life out here.

656
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:28,070
Thanks, Clyde.

657
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:31,240
You, um...

658
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,144
sure your girl's worth it?

659
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:36,413
Coming all this way?

660
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:40,416
Yeah.

661
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,152
Yeah, she is.

662
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,788
Don't settle, Joel.

663
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,291
She's right.

664
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,327
You don't have to.

665
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:53,697
Not even at
the end of the world.

666
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:08,777
Okay! Time to break camp! Let's go!

667
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:10,713
Uh, wh...

668
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:12,214
Lesson two.

669
00:44:12,347 --> 00:44:15,284
You get a hot meal
or a good night's sleep.

670
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,787
- Not both.
- Not both.

671
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,755
Are you being serious?

672
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:22,057
Something will have smelled our food and
be all over this camp within the hour.

673
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:26,194
Why wouldn't you tell me that, though?
Uh, I didn't... I didn't do either.

674
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:29,231
I can't tell you everything,
man. Keep up.

675
00:44:39,809 --> 00:44:44,113
"Roar! I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson!
I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!"

676
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:48,083
"I'm Joel,
and I can't protect my girlfriend

677
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:51,519
because I'm useless and insecure
and an awkward little teenager."

678
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:53,789
"But I need you to save me!
I thought you loved me."

679
00:44:53,922 --> 00:44:57,459
"But I can't because..."

680
00:44:57,592 --> 00:44:59,628
- What?
- That's your girlfriend dying.

681
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:01,998
- What?
- A needle through water.

682
00:45:02,865 --> 00:45:05,768
A needle through water.
Needle through water.

683
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:11,207
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Yes! See? Bull's-eye!

684
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,476
Oh.

685
00:45:13,608 --> 00:45:15,376
Got yourself
an admirer there, huh?

686
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,614
Hey, we gotta get going.

687
00:45:17,746 --> 00:45:19,280
Uh, okay.

688
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:21,650
Come on. Come on.
We gotta go. We...

689
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,988
Minnow? What are you doing?

690
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:28,691
<i>Dear Aimee,
I made friends.</i>

691
00:45:28,824 --> 00:45:29,992
<i>Human friends.</i>

692
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:31,861
<i>And they're teaching me
everything they know.</i>

693
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:36,432
<i>Like lesson three:
Don't take shortcuts.</i>

694
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,038
<i>Lesson eight:
Target practice every day.</i>

695
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,739
<i>I'm getting pretty good
with my crossbow.</i>

696
00:45:43,873 --> 00:45:45,740
- See?
- Pretty good.

697
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:49,746
<i>Lesson ten: Keep your socks dry.
That's a great one.</i>

698
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:53,550
<i>I'm kinda struggling
with lesson two: Not both.</i>

699
00:45:53,682 --> 00:45:55,385
<i>That one is not great.</i>

700
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:58,320
Not both. Not both.

701
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:00,923
Come on, Joel. Not both.

702
00:46:01,056 --> 00:46:02,891
<i>I'm super tired.</i>

703
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:14,671
All right, a lot of things out
here you shouldn't touch or eat,

704
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:18,340
but, uh, ferns like these
have an antivenom.

705
00:46:18,474 --> 00:46:21,678
Good in a pinch
for snakes, slugs.

706
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:24,247
- Great entry for your book.
- Yep, got it.

707
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,284
The insect-looking ones
got no peripheral vision.

708
00:46:28,416 --> 00:46:29,652
No peripheral... Ah!

709
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:32,288
The lizard-looking ones
can't climb for shit.

710
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:35,958
The amphibian-looking ones like to
hide, lure ya in, eat ya whole.

711
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:38,360
Then there are the Sandgobblers.

712
00:46:38,494 --> 00:46:40,129
Those guys are badasses.

713
00:46:40,262 --> 00:46:42,164
Badasses!

714
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:44,132
Yeah, I know.
I fell into their hole.

715
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:45,902
What you saw were worker bees.

716
00:46:46,034 --> 00:46:49,605
What you wanna avoid under
all circumstances is a queen.

717
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:51,407
How do I know if it's a queen?

718
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:55,478
Well, your first clue would be a
giant fin slicing through the earth,

719
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:58,782
following every single sound
and vibration you make.

720
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:00,817
You howling in pain...

721
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,952
...as you're being ripped
in half will be your second.

722
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,855
Copy. I'll keep that in mind.

723
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:10,492
Well, we're getting
close to where our paths diverge.

724
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:14,097
You're gonna wanna go west
to Jenner, the beaches.

725
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,867
Or you can be sensible,
come with us to the mountains.

726
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,270
Yeah, um, I think I've been
sensible all my life,

727
00:47:22,403 --> 00:47:24,007
and it's really
gotten me nowhere.

728
00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:26,708
Come with us.
Strength in numbers, you know?

729
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:29,579
Besides,
think we'd make a good team.

730
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:31,914
No, I think so, too.
I just, uh...

731
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:34,050
It's just something I gotta do.

732
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:36,152
It's not fair.

733
00:47:36,284 --> 00:47:38,887
Wh... Hey. Wha...

734
00:47:39,021 --> 00:47:42,291
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa. What's going on?

735
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,394
Why do you gotta go?

736
00:47:46,161 --> 00:47:49,331
'Cause this girl, she means a lot to me.
You know?

737
00:47:49,465 --> 00:47:53,436
Come on. You know I gotta do this.
We talked about this.

738
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:57,139
Hey, you know what?
I got something for ya.

739
00:47:57,273 --> 00:47:59,675
I don't even know if you'd know
what this is, but...

740
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:01,110
Lipstick?

741
00:48:01,242 --> 00:48:02,277
Oh.

742
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:04,212
- What?
- Yeah.

743
00:48:04,347 --> 00:48:06,615
Yeah, it's lip...

744
00:48:06,748 --> 00:48:08,050
Aw.

745
00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:12,153
I take back
what I said before.

746
00:48:12,288 --> 00:48:13,923
Aimee's gonna love you.

747
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,592
Thanks, Minnow.
You got some snot.

748
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:20,129
Yeah.

749
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:23,565
All right. Come on.

750
00:48:29,438 --> 00:48:31,007
Final lesson.

751
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:34,343
Listen to your instincts
out here.

752
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:35,944
They'll keep you alive.

753
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,749
Yeah. What if I have,
uh, terrible instincts?

754
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:40,916
You'll die.

755
00:48:41,449 --> 00:48:42,884
Y...

756
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:47,121
Listen, man, good instincts
are earned by making mistakes.

757
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,292
If you're lucky enough
to survive a few mistakes,

758
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:52,661
you're gonna be
okay out here.

759
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:56,332
This might come in handy, too.

760
00:48:56,465 --> 00:48:57,833
Wow!

761
00:48:58,701 --> 00:48:59,969
Oh, that's great.
Do you have, uh...

762
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:01,836
Do you have any more
that I could have?

763
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:03,005
You get one.

764
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:07,242
Pull the pin, count to five.
Not four, not six.

765
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:08,976
Five.

766
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,480
Got it.

767
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:15,151
You're gonna be okay.

768
00:49:16,985 --> 00:49:17,953
Minnow?

769
00:49:18,086 --> 00:49:19,521
Let's go, kid.

770
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,928
Hey, man, you made it
all this way from Fairfield.

771
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:29,199
What's another 30 miles, huh?

772
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:41,242
Uh-oh, here he comes.

773
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:43,112
Hi.

774
00:49:45,414 --> 00:49:46,816
Hey there.

775
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:01,864
I know.
I'm gonna miss 'em, too.

776
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,465
It's a good decision,
though. It's good.

777
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:06,835
You feel good about it,
right?

778
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:11,173
Come on, Boy.

779
00:50:46,775 --> 00:50:49,144
Aw, I'm okay.
I'm just gonna...

780
00:50:50,146 --> 00:50:51,781
You can have that.

781
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:54,549
I'll just stick
to the beans.

782
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:55,818
I'm good.

783
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,254
I'm not gonna eat that,
so...

784
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:17,272
Hey, come on.
We gotta keep moving.

785
00:51:17,405 --> 00:51:20,943
I know. There's a lot
of creepy stuff. Creepy boats.

786
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:23,979
Kind of a creepy sign.

787
00:51:24,112 --> 00:51:27,182
But nothing
we haven't seen before.

788
00:51:27,315 --> 00:51:28,583
Just gotta be brave.

789
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,752
What...

790
00:51:32,054 --> 00:51:34,690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on? What's happening?

791
00:51:34,822 --> 00:51:35,891
You okay?

792
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:38,628
You hearing something, Boy?

793
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:41,130
Boy, Boy, Boy! Boy!

794
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:46,300
Hey! Boy! Boy! Boy!

795
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:47,969
Boy! Are you okay?

796
00:51:48,103 --> 00:51:50,173
I need some kind
of communication here.

797
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:55,143
Oh. I hear it.

798
00:52:06,255 --> 00:52:07,489
We gotta go. Hey.

799
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:11,360
We really gotta go.
Please get out from under the duck.

800
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:22,105
We gotta go.

801
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:22,365
<i>Joel. You okay?</i>

802
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,001
You okay?

803
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,602
Joel! Get out of the car!

804
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,638
<i>Joel, get outta the car!</i>

805
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,077
Run, Joel, run!

806
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,145
<i>Run! Go!</i>

807
00:53:41,684 --> 00:53:42,952
<i>You can survive this.</i>

808
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:46,222
I love you. I love you.

809
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:09,778
No.

810
00:54:13,514 --> 00:54:14,850
Hey!

811
00:54:33,702 --> 00:54:35,938
Boy?

812
00:54:38,474 --> 00:54:40,143
Are you okay?

813
00:54:43,344 --> 00:54:44,980
Yeah! Yeah, you're okay!
You're okay!

814
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:48,550
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

815
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:50,319
Aren't you? Aren't you?

816
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,154
Ah!

817
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,489
Yeah!

818
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:56,359
We're monster killers.

819
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:59,528
Whoo-ooh!

820
00:55:05,434 --> 00:55:06,836
Ah!

821
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:13,909
Wow.

822
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:16,612
You know, I haven't felt
the rain in seven years.

823
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:19,248
Pretty cool.
Pretty cool.

824
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:26,121
Hey, Boy,
you think I'm crazy?

825
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:29,424
Coming all this way?

826
00:55:32,126 --> 00:55:34,163
Hello.

827
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,615
Holy shit.

828
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:57,686
You're alive.

829
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,489
I mean... you're on.

830
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:05,894
I have 51 minutes of power left.
What is your name?

831
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:08,596
Uh, I'm Joel.

832
00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:11,967
- My name is Joel.
- Hello, Joel.

833
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:14,536
I am so pleased to meet you.

834
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,238
My name is Mavis.

835
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:18,373
But if you were to write it out,

836
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:21,376
you would write it
with a 1 and not an I.

837
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,178
Yeah, I know.

838
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:27,181
You are familiar with the Mav1s line.
Delightful!

839
00:56:27,315 --> 00:56:29,717
You guys were supposed to be
the next amazing thing.

840
00:56:29,851 --> 00:56:31,554
I can't believe
I'm talkin' to one.

841
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,422
But if you were to write it out,

842
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,659
you would write it
with a 1 and not an I.

843
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,194
Yeah. You said that.

844
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:43,164
Years ago, I was bitten in half

845
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:46,534
by something
I did not get a chance to name.

846
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:49,471
I crawled here for safety
and powered down,

847
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:52,840
hoping someone
would one day find me.

848
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:55,309
And here you are!

849
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:56,277
Amazing.

850
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:58,847
Joel, besides
conversing with me,

851
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,715
for which
I am eternally grateful,

852
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:04,652
may I ask what you are doing
outside of your colony?

853
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:05,721
Yeah, um...

854
00:57:05,853 --> 00:57:08,490
Did you steal food?

855
00:57:08,623 --> 00:57:09,857
No.

856
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,525
No, I didn't steal
any food.

857
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:15,998
Um, I'm actually on a quest...
to find a girl.

858
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:20,067
Why, Joel, a lovely lady
has caught your eye!

859
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:21,436
What is her name?

860
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:25,374
Uh, her name's Aimee.
With one I and two E's.

861
00:57:25,507 --> 00:57:29,545
She sounds like
an incredible person, Joel.

862
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,715
Is there anything
I can do to assist you

863
00:57:33,849 --> 00:57:37,486
in your quest for Aimee
with one I and two E's?

864
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:42,358
Nope. Appreciate it, Mav1s,
but, uh, unfortunately not.

865
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:46,329
Unless you happen to have a power
source to an SK-21 ham radio handy.

866
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:49,398
Oh, no, but...

867
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:52,800
I would be honored to donate
my remaining power to you

868
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:57,373
if it would help you with your quest
for Aimee with one I and two E's.

869
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,213
She probably thinks
I've been devoured by now.

870
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:08,017
Oh, this is all so exciting!

871
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,555
- It's working.
- Hooray!

872
00:58:13,688 --> 00:58:16,090
3022? Come in, 3022.

873
00:58:16,224 --> 00:58:18,427
- <i>Joel?</i>
- Aimee! Hey. Hey.

874
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,996
<i>Your colony told me you were
coming here. Are you okay?</i>

875
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,599
<i>I was worried.
It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

876
00:58:23,731 --> 00:58:27,168
Yeah, it's good to hear yours, too.
Yeah, I'm alive. I'm good. I'm okay.

877
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:29,971
<i>I-I-I can't believe
you're actually doing this.</i>

878
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:33,141
I know. It's crazy. Aimee,
I cannot wait to tell you everything.

879
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,077
I feel like a whole new man,
you know?

880
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:37,512
You should see me out here.
I'm fighting monsters.

881
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:39,914
I'm in a motel right now
with a robot and a dog.

882
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:42,250
<i>What? That sounds crazy.</i>

883
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:44,519
<i>How far are you
from Jenner Beach?</i>

884
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:48,189
Um, how far? I'm getting close.
I'm, um...

885
00:58:49,157 --> 00:58:50,525
I'm 9.3 miles to you.

886
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:53,595
<i>Joel, listen.
I have amazing news.</i>

887
00:58:53,728 --> 00:58:56,931
<i>Some survivors showed up a few days
ago, and they're rescuing us.</i>

888
00:58:57,065 --> 00:58:58,399
<i>They're gonna get us
out of here!</i>

889
00:58:58,532 --> 00:59:00,935
<i>They're really helping me
with the colony.</i>

890
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:03,706
Oh. Okay, g-getting you out
of there? What do you mean?

891
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,342
<i>I can't remember the last time I actually
felt like everything was going to be...</i>

892
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:09,577
Wh... Aimee?

893
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,012
Aimee? Aimee?

894
00:59:11,146 --> 00:59:12,248
Shit.

895
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,083
My battery
has automatically shut down

896
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:19,755
in order to preserve
my final 15 minutes of power.

897
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:22,958
- I am very sorry, Joel.
- No, it's okay, Mav1s.

898
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,027
You don't have to...

899
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:28,997
Joel?

900
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,033
I haven't been outside
in a very long time.

901
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:35,403
Yeah. I hadn't, either.

902
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:44,813
- There you go.
- Is something troubling you, Joel?

903
00:59:44,947 --> 00:59:49,084
You can tell me anything,
as I am an empathetic listener.

904
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:55,423
Also, my memory banks will be
permanently erased in 14 minutes.

905
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:01,228
You know that feeling where you just
completely put yourself out there?

906
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:02,964
You know?
And you're so sure of it.

907
01:00:03,097 --> 01:00:06,902
And... right when you're
about to cross the finish line,

908
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:11,972
you just think is this the dumbest...
thing I ever could've done?

909
01:00:12,106 --> 01:00:14,742
I don't think it's dumb,
Joel.

910
01:00:14,876 --> 01:00:17,078
I think it's romantic.

911
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:19,581
Right, see?
Yeah, okay, you get it.

912
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:22,384
Romantic, that's what...
Yeah.

913
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:25,686
Do not give up
on your quest, Joel.

914
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,125
When you see her, she will
appreciate the grand romantic gesture

915
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,893
implied by your journey

916
01:00:32,025 --> 01:00:35,964
and be moved by your kindness
and leadership qualities.

917
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:37,333
Thanks, Mav1s.

918
01:00:38,766 --> 01:00:43,103
Another option is that Aimee will
not see those qualities in you

919
01:00:43,237 --> 01:00:45,440
and you will have traveled
a great distance

920
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:48,409
only to be met
with disappointment.

921
01:00:48,543 --> 01:00:52,647
Perhaps you will have learned
valuable lessons along the way?

922
01:00:53,148 --> 01:00:54,649
Okay.

923
01:00:54,782 --> 01:00:58,452
A third option is that you
don't survive the journey at all

924
01:00:58,586 --> 01:01:00,688
and get eaten
by mutated insects...

925
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:02,656
- Okay, that's... I get it.
- ...amphibians...

926
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:05,126
There are so many ways
you could perish.

927
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,227
I get it.

928
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,663
Thanks for the...

929
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,532
Thanks for that.

930
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,803
Would you like
to see a trick, Joel?

931
01:01:14,936 --> 01:01:16,337
Sure.

932
01:01:16,471 --> 01:01:19,574
What is your full name,
and where were you born?

933
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:22,278
Uh, Joel Dawson.
Fairfield, California.

934
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,681
Whoa.

935
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,251
Whoa.

936
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:32,320
What lovely parents
you had, Joel.

937
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,191
Oh, my God.

938
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:36,858
Wow.

939
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:39,627
I don't even have a picture.

940
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,097
What would you say
to your mother now, Joel,

941
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:45,334
if you had the chance?

942
01:01:51,572 --> 01:01:53,608
I guess I'd tell her I'm okay.

943
01:01:58,346 --> 01:02:00,583
<i>I made it to a colony.</i>

944
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,887
Met a lot of really,
really good people

945
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:07,590
who took really good care of me.

946
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:17,332
They also lost a lot, so...

947
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:22,437
And I miss you guys so much.

948
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:28,644
I'm so sorry.

949
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:42,624
Oh, look! Sky Jellies!

950
01:02:42,757 --> 01:02:46,528
They're harmless
and quite lovely.

951
01:02:47,728 --> 01:02:48,896
Wow.

952
01:02:50,097 --> 01:02:52,934
Oh! <i>Canis familiaris!</i>

953
01:02:53,068 --> 01:02:56,338
You found my foot.
Thank you.

954
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:59,742
- That's my dog.
- He's delightful.

955
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:03,579
Yeah, he's a good boy.

956
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:08,584
Joel, would you like to hear a song?

957
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:10,686
Yeah, okay.

958
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,915
You know, nature's kinda nice

959
01:03:40,048 --> 01:03:42,083
when there's nothing trying
to kill you.

960
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,826
Mav1s?

961
01:03:56,297 --> 01:03:57,765
Thanks.

962
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,974
<i>Some survivors
showed up at the camp.</i>

963
01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:10,044
That's not something I gotta worry
about, you don't think, right?

964
01:04:10,177 --> 01:04:12,914
I mean, what are the odds
that they're, like, awesome

965
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:17,251
and similar to my age and potentially
a threat to me romantically?

966
01:04:17,385 --> 01:04:19,286
Slim to none, probably.

967
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:22,490
I think it's good, actually.
I think we're totally, uh... fine.

968
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:25,760
Actually, why don't we pick up the
pace a little bit, just in case...

969
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:28,564
Um...

970
01:04:29,463 --> 01:04:31,333
Okay, you know what?

971
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:33,469
Why don't we go
another way. Yeah?

972
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:36,070
Uh...

973
01:04:39,407 --> 01:04:40,342
Boy?

974
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:41,710
Boy!

975
01:04:43,344 --> 01:04:45,213
Boy, where you going?

976
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:58,494
Queen.

977
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,123
Run, Boy! Run!

978
01:05:29,257 --> 01:05:30,793
Get...

979
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:34,663
Go, go! Go!

980
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:41,935
Sh...

981
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,976
Wait!

982
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:49,344
Boy!

983
01:05:49,476 --> 01:05:51,913
Boy, I can't run that fast!

984
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:10,565
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

985
01:06:32,153 --> 01:06:33,889
Shh-shh-shh. Shh.

986
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:40,229
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

987
01:07:09,523 --> 01:07:12,827
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry.

988
01:07:13,327 --> 01:07:14,695
I'm sorry.

989
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,869
What are you doing?

990
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:23,438
Don't you dare.

991
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:26,208
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

992
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:30,211
No. Wait, Boy!

993
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:31,679
Boy!

994
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,849
Boy, don't even think about it.

995
01:07:34,983 --> 01:07:36,617
Don't. Don't you do it.

996
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:38,753
Don't. Don't. No!

997
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:52,968
Count to five.

998
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:55,704
One, two...

999
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,109
Two. Uh, three, four...

1000
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,644
five!

1001
01:08:23,097 --> 01:08:25,065
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1002
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,701
Yes!

1003
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,171
Yes! Oh, my God!

1004
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:31,972
Oh, that was awesome.

1005
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:34,507
I feel like Tom Cruise.

1006
01:08:36,844 --> 01:08:40,213
Oh! Ow.
What the hell is...

1007
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:41,917
Ow!

1008
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,725
Ow!

1009
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,396
Oh, my God.

1010
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:57,399
Ow! Ow!

1011
01:09:00,135 --> 01:09:02,369
Get that dress
out of my face!

1012
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,373
Boy?

1013
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:17,485
Oh!

1014
01:09:23,524 --> 01:09:25,027
Oh, f...

1015
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:38,271
Okay.

1016
01:09:38,405 --> 01:09:40,007
Oh, no.

1017
01:09:58,259 --> 01:10:00,627
Okay, all right,
I think I'm good.

1018
01:10:00,761 --> 01:10:02,464
I think I got 'em all.

1019
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:05,333
What?

1020
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:10,639
God! No!

1021
01:10:14,475 --> 01:10:16,411
You! You! You!

1022
01:10:16,543 --> 01:10:19,547
This is all your fault!
What is wrong with you?

1023
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,116
Why don't you listen to me,
huh? Huh?

1024
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,418
You have any idea what you just did?
You just almost got us killed!

1025
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:27,221
We are supposed to care
about each other, okay?

1026
01:10:27,354 --> 01:10:31,058
I would never do that to you, never!
You bailed on me! Oh, my God!

1027
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:34,228
That freakin' dress!
I can't take it anymore!

1028
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,649
<i>Dear Aimee,
It's not looking good.</i>

1029
01:10:55,783 --> 01:10:57,919
<i>And by "it," I don't remember
what I was talking about.</i>

1030
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:02,157
<i>I can't feel my feet.</i>

1031
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:03,358
<i>Or my face.</i>

1032
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:06,594
<i>I think I'm dying.</i>

1033
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:21,876
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Joel Dawson!
I'm gonna eat you like broccoli!</i>

1034
01:11:23,176 --> 01:11:25,579
<i>Ferns like these
have an antivenom.</i>

1035
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:29,183
<i>Good in a pinch for snakes, slugs.</i>

1036
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:59,414
<i>If you find the best dog ever,</i>

1037
01:11:59,546 --> 01:12:01,015
<i>that's Boy.</i>

1038
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,051
<i>Please, look after him.</i>

1039
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,154
<i>Tell him I'm sorry.</i>

1040
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:08,322
- Have you seen my dog?
- <i>Tell him I love him.</i>

1041
01:12:08,456 --> 01:12:10,925
Have you seen him?
I yelled at him.

1042
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:13,394
<i>And don't take his dress out of his mouth.
He doesn't like that.</i>

1043
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:15,396
And now I might not
ever see him again.

1044
01:12:15,529 --> 01:12:18,599
<i>And please don't shout at him.
I know you won't.</i>

1045
01:12:21,269 --> 01:12:22,436
Joel.

1046
01:12:23,704 --> 01:12:25,171
Oh, my God.

1047
01:12:25,706 --> 01:12:28,009
- It's you.
- Aimee?

1048
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,478
I can't believe you made it.

1049
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:33,514
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you made it.

1050
01:12:33,646 --> 01:12:35,382
You made it,
Joel.

1051
01:12:36,016 --> 01:12:38,854
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1052
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:42,823
Oh, you're so beautiful.

1053
01:12:58,005 --> 01:12:59,574
That was nice.

1054
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:14,956
Aimee?

1055
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:17,925
Aimee.

1056
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:19,761
- Aimee.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1057
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,395
T-T-Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1058
01:13:21,529 --> 01:13:24,900
Still pretty messed up from all the poison.
How do you feel?

1059
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,168
I feel... I'm good.

1060
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:29,469
Good. No, I'm f...
I-I'm okay.

1061
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:33,673
What was it like? I mean,
you have to tell me everything.

1062
01:13:33,807 --> 01:13:36,877
Honestly, it wasn't that bad. I don't
know what everyone's complaining about.

1063
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:39,546
- Oh?
- No, it was terrible.

1064
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,581
I almost... died a lot.

1065
01:13:42,984 --> 01:13:45,119
It's so good to see you.

1066
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:47,788
I'm lucky you found me
when you did.

1067
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:49,189
About that, um...

1068
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:51,425
And hey, we... kissed.

1069
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:54,596
- You were hallucinating pretty hard.
- How amazing was that, huh?

1070
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:56,564
You kissed Old Pete.

1071
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,401
- Hi, Pete.
- Oh. Yeah.

1072
01:14:01,702 --> 01:14:03,271
That'd be hilarious.

1073
01:14:05,907 --> 01:14:07,409
Oh, yeah,
I really did.

1074
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,680
I don't know how
to move on from this.

1075
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:14,914
What was that you said
on the radio about, uh...

1076
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:18,552
Yeah. This yacht captain and his
crew show up out of the blue.

1077
01:14:18,686 --> 01:14:21,288
- Did you say a yacht captain?
- Yeah, yeah.

1078
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:24,490
And he says he can find us a safe
place to live and a new home.

1079
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,293
I'm trying to pack
everything up right now.

1080
01:14:26,426 --> 01:14:28,128
Why is he called
a yacht captain?

1081
01:14:28,261 --> 01:14:30,130
'Cause he's the captain
of the yacht, you moron.

1082
01:14:30,264 --> 01:14:32,634
Oh, my God.
Be nice, Bill.

1083
01:14:32,766 --> 01:14:34,534
- What?
- I'm trying to listen.

1084
01:14:34,668 --> 01:14:37,706
So anyway, I just wanted to say
something to you, though...

1085
01:14:37,838 --> 01:14:38,773
- Whoo.
- Oh!

1086
01:14:38,905 --> 01:14:40,274
Aimee! Aimee!

1087
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:42,510
We got another leak
in the main line.

1088
01:14:42,643 --> 01:14:45,212
Bastard's spitting freshwater
all over the beach!

1089
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:48,114
Yeah, yeah, thank you, Janice.
I'll be right there.

1090
01:14:48,248 --> 01:14:49,849
- Oh.
- Hi, Joel.

1091
01:14:49,984 --> 01:14:51,919
Hey, Janice.
Good to meet you.

1092
01:14:52,052 --> 01:14:53,421
- Please...
- Everyone's so old.

1093
01:14:53,554 --> 01:14:56,091
- You came at a crazy time.
- Yeah.

1094
01:14:56,224 --> 01:14:58,226
- Can we put a pin in this?
- Yeah.

1095
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:00,695
Put a pin in it. Sure.

1096
01:15:18,078 --> 01:15:19,514
Hey, man.

1097
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:38,432
It's all falling apart, Aimee.

1098
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:41,935
I don't know what's happening here.
What can we do?

1099
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:45,139
Yeah, I know, Janice.
I'm sorry.

1100
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:47,908
Janice, will you just...
Will you give me the wrench?

1101
01:15:48,775 --> 01:15:50,778
This is a shitshow.

1102
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:54,282
Who left the kelp out in the sun?
That was meant to be packed up already.

1103
01:15:54,414 --> 01:15:56,617
- It's gonna bring in the flies.
- It's swellin' up.

1104
01:15:56,751 --> 01:16:00,288
Yeah, I don't think feet
are meant to be that color.

1105
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:02,957
Hey.

1106
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,324
Perfect timing.

1107
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:07,394
Guys! Joel,
this is Dana and Rocko.

1108
01:16:07,528 --> 01:16:10,030
- What's up?
- These are the guys from the yacht.

1109
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:11,465
Cool. Oh.

1110
01:16:11,597 --> 01:16:14,001
Is that a...
Is that an arm cannon?

1111
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:15,536
Homemade.

1112
01:16:15,668 --> 01:16:18,271
So which one...
which one of you is the yacht captain?

1113
01:16:18,404 --> 01:16:21,007
Guilty as charged.
Captain Brooks Wilkinson.

1114
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:23,210
- Royal Australian Navy.
- Oh, dear God.

1115
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:26,146
Retired, of course.
My mates call me Cap.

1116
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:27,282
How you doing, man?

1117
01:16:27,414 --> 01:16:28,582
I see you've met
these specimens,

1118
01:16:28,716 --> 01:16:31,018
but this beautiful lady,
that's our yacht.

1119
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:34,889
A little showy for my taste,
but she gets the job done.

1120
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,823
- Huh.
- Cap, this is Joel.

1121
01:16:36,957 --> 01:16:38,525
Joel. Right.

1122
01:16:38,658 --> 01:16:41,094
Joel ended up traveling seven
days on the surface to get here.

1123
01:16:41,228 --> 01:16:43,297
- Seven days?
- Seven... Yeah, seven days.

1124
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,899
- That is one hell of a journey, Joel.
- It was. Yeah.

1125
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:48,068
I don't get it.
Why'd you leave your colony, Joel?

1126
01:16:48,202 --> 01:16:49,804
You get caught stealing food?

1127
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:53,606
No, I didn't get caught stealing food.
Why is that such a thing?

1128
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,475
He came for love.

1129
01:16:55,609 --> 01:16:57,143
Good on ya, mate.
That's beautiful.

1130
01:16:57,278 --> 01:17:00,048
There is no mission
more admirable than love.

1131
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,482
Every sailor
worth his salt knows that.

1132
01:17:02,615 --> 01:17:04,551
Yo, Cap.
We cooking this shit or what?

1133
01:17:04,685 --> 01:17:06,987
Feel like I got King Kong's nuts
on my shoulders, man.

1134
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:09,090
That's charming, Rock,
really.

1135
01:17:09,222 --> 01:17:12,460
Joel, you look like a man who
knows his way around a barbecue.

1136
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:15,262
- I... don't...
- Come help us get a fire started.

1137
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:17,764
Um, actually, I'm gonna...

1138
01:17:17,898 --> 01:17:21,034
- catch up with Aimee for a sec, if it's...
- Yeah.

1139
01:17:21,167 --> 01:17:23,436
I apologize.
I... Old habits.

1140
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:27,007
You show up and...
here I am trying to give you orders.

1141
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:28,475
I'll give you guys
some privacy, yeah?

1142
01:17:28,609 --> 01:17:30,411
- Thank you.
- Yeah, <i>namaste.</i>

1143
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,212
Uh, I was gonna just,
if you...

1144
01:17:32,345 --> 01:17:33,647
- Hey, Joel.
- Yeah?

1145
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,716
We're throwing a killer
going-away party tonight.

1146
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:37,083
Nothing fancy, but...

1147
01:17:37,217 --> 01:17:39,653
we'll have a drink together
to welcome you to the colony.

1148
01:17:39,787 --> 01:17:40,722
Okay.

1149
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:42,054
First beer's on me.

1150
01:17:42,189 --> 01:17:43,591
Thanks.

1151
01:17:43,724 --> 01:17:45,259
He's nice.

1152
01:17:45,391 --> 01:17:46,693
Brews his own beer.

1153
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,130
- Oh.
- Hello, darling. How are you?

1154
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:51,265
Course he does.

1155
01:17:54,135 --> 01:17:56,704
I'm sorry. There's just so much
going on right now.

1156
01:17:56,837 --> 01:17:58,038
- Do you mind?
- Yeah.

1157
01:17:58,171 --> 01:17:59,205
It's crazy.

1158
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,408
Pretty nice here, you know.

1159
01:18:01,542 --> 01:18:03,711
Why, uh...
why do you have to leave?

1160
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:06,347
- It's beautiful. It's just not safe.
- Right.

1161
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,047
Everyone's afraid.

1162
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:11,618
Even your bunker got breached,
and you're all young and strong.

1163
01:18:11,752 --> 01:18:12,952
Yeah.

1164
01:18:13,087 --> 01:18:14,822
Hey, Aimee?

1165
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:18,859
Sorry. I know you got, like,
a lot going on, but, uh...

1166
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:23,063
you know, I came...
I came all the way here to see you,

1167
01:18:23,197 --> 01:18:26,734
and so I'm just...
checkin' in.

1168
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,538
Just wondering how you're...
feeling about that.

1169
01:18:30,671 --> 01:18:33,106
I think it's the most romantic
thing anyone's ever done.

1170
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,809
You do? Okay.
Okay, good, 'cause, um...

1171
01:18:35,943 --> 01:18:38,445
But listen, Joel, um...

1172
01:18:38,578 --> 01:18:41,614
talking to you on the radio
was such a nice escape

1173
01:18:41,748 --> 01:18:43,818
from the stress
of running this colony.

1174
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,586
Yeah.

1175
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:46,886
And, um...

1176
01:18:48,154 --> 01:18:51,557
I mean, you're probably the only
person left alive from my old life.

1177
01:18:52,024 --> 01:18:53,795
From Fairfield.

1178
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:58,398
Oh. There's a...

1179
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,970
There's a "but" coming,
isn't there?

1180
01:19:03,503 --> 01:19:06,908
But I didn't think
you'd actually come here, Joel.

1181
01:19:07,774 --> 01:19:09,143
Oh. Um...

1182
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:11,346
And I am so happy
to see you.

1183
01:19:11,479 --> 01:19:12,847
I'm just not...

1184
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:16,384
I'm not the same person
that I used to be, you know?

1185
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:18,752
Seven years,
that's a long time.

1186
01:19:18,886 --> 01:19:22,323
I've... I've lost people.
My mom, my friends, and...

1187
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:25,025
Last year I lost someone...

1188
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:28,596
and he meant a lot to me.

1189
01:19:29,963 --> 01:19:31,265
Um...

1190
01:19:31,932 --> 01:19:33,268
Whew.

1191
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,522
Oh, man, I feel
like such an idiot.

1192
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:57,757
- No. No, don't.
- I didn't even...

1193
01:19:57,891 --> 01:20:00,827
I didn't even ask you
if I should come.

1194
01:20:00,961 --> 01:20:04,164
I just got so excited,
and I... I left.

1195
01:20:04,297 --> 01:20:06,400
I don't know what I thought.

1196
01:20:07,634 --> 01:20:09,636
Well, I know
what I thought.

1197
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:13,507
I'd come and...
and sweep you off your feet,

1198
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,775
and we'd be happy.

1199
01:20:15,908 --> 01:20:17,210
Oh, Joel.

1200
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:22,250
But you...
didn't w-want... me.

1201
01:20:22,382 --> 01:20:26,386
I am so sorry. I should have
said something on the radio or...

1202
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:29,023
No. It's okay.
It's okay. Um...

1203
01:20:29,155 --> 01:20:32,393
I know this isn't how
you pictured this going, but...

1204
01:20:34,895 --> 01:20:36,630
you'll still
come with us, right?

1205
01:20:36,764 --> 01:20:40,702
Come with you...
Uh, on the... yacht?

1206
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:45,105
This is our shot
at survival.

1207
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,010
Give Cap a chance.

1208
01:20:52,613 --> 01:20:54,782
Tell us.

1209
01:20:54,914 --> 01:20:57,118
Yeah, come on, Cap.
Tell us another story.

1210
01:20:57,251 --> 01:21:00,021
- Yeah, come on.
- Four years post-Agatha.

1211
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,089
HMS Brisbane. First watch.

1212
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:04,425
I was the first person
to see it coming over the wall.

1213
01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:07,094
Giant lizard, two stories high.

1214
01:21:07,862 --> 01:21:11,599
I sounded the alarm.
Too late.

1215
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:14,600
We lost 1,032 souls that night.

1216
01:21:14,734 --> 01:21:16,903
Those of us that survived
took to the sea.

1217
01:21:17,037 --> 01:21:21,242
I mean, make no mistake.
We have lost this war. Right?

1218
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:25,112
There is no place for mankind on land.
But out there?

1219
01:21:25,244 --> 01:21:27,247
There we got a chance.

1220
01:21:27,381 --> 01:21:29,483
I've got a...

1221
01:21:29,617 --> 01:21:32,485
Sorry. Just got a... question.

1222
01:21:32,618 --> 01:21:34,621
I survived seven days
on the surface,

1223
01:21:34,755 --> 01:21:39,092
and... if I can do that,
literally anyone can.

1224
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:42,395
Seven days on the surface?
I'm impressed.

1225
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:45,698
So maybe we still have
a chance... to fight

1226
01:21:45,832 --> 01:21:48,869
and... and, you know, win, uh...

1227
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:51,537
win our...
win our world back.

1228
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:56,009
I have a plan. And if you have a
better one, mate, I'm... I'm all ears.

1229
01:21:56,143 --> 01:21:59,078
- And I will stand by your side.
- You wanna hear my...

1230
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:01,347
You wanna hear my plan?

1231
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:02,817
It's, uh...

1232
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,185
just, uh...

1233
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:13,327
I got nothing, uh...

1234
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,927
Hey, that's on me.

1235
01:22:15,061 --> 01:22:17,963
I-I didn't mean to put you
on the spot, mate. It's...

1236
01:22:18,097 --> 01:22:21,768
Well... Aimee tells
me you make a mean minestrone.

1237
01:22:22,536 --> 01:22:23,871
And you're great
on the radio.

1238
01:22:24,003 --> 01:22:26,139
Lord knows
I need a comms expert.

1239
01:22:26,273 --> 01:22:29,710
Someone to teach Rocko how to cook.

1240
01:22:30,978 --> 01:22:34,815
Do you guys have a radio I could use?
I want to contact my colony.

1241
01:22:35,716 --> 01:22:39,220
7045, this is 3022.
Come in.

1242
01:22:41,555 --> 01:22:45,059
7045, this is 3022.
Is anyone there?

1243
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:46,860
Tim? Ava?
Anyone. Over.

1244
01:22:46,993 --> 01:22:49,662
Cap thought you might
need a snack.

1245
01:22:49,796 --> 01:22:52,165
- Oh.
- You know, he brews his own beer.

1246
01:22:53,167 --> 01:22:55,603
- Yep. Yeah, I heard.
- It's good, man.

1247
01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:57,939
- Cool. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1248
01:23:51,926 --> 01:23:53,961
<i>Hello? Is someone there?</i>

1249
01:23:54,094 --> 01:23:55,229
Hey. Yeah! Yeah!

1250
01:23:55,362 --> 01:23:57,463
Yeah, Ray, is that you?
It's me. It's Joel.

1251
01:23:57,596 --> 01:23:59,099
<i>Joel?</i> <i>Oh, my God!</i>

1252
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:01,768
<i>Hey, guys! It's Joel. He made it!</i>

1253
01:24:01,902 --> 01:24:03,936
- <i>You're kidding!</i>
- Hey. Hey, guys!

1254
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:06,506
It's me. It's Joel.
I'm... I'm... I'm safe.

1255
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,742
I-I made it.
I'm at Aimee's colony.

1256
01:24:08,876 --> 01:24:10,644
- <i>He made it!</i>
- <i>Oh, my God, you're alive?</i>

1257
01:24:10,777 --> 01:24:12,045
It's so good
to hear your guys' voices.

1258
01:24:12,179 --> 01:24:13,748
<i>So good
to hear you, too, buddy.</i>

1259
01:24:13,881 --> 01:24:15,582
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- I feel like it's been so long.

1260
01:24:15,716 --> 01:24:18,251
- I've got so much to tell you guys.
- <i>Tell us what you've seen.</i>

1261
01:24:18,385 --> 01:24:22,155
- I saw a queen Sandgobbler.
- <i>What's a queen Sandgobbler?</i>

1262
01:24:22,288 --> 01:24:24,391
It's... I don't know,
but I blew it up.

1263
01:24:24,524 --> 01:24:26,027
I blew it up
with a hand grenade!

1264
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,527
<i>Where'd you get a grenade?</i>

1265
01:24:27,661 --> 01:24:29,262
Yeah,
it was so awesome, and...

1266
01:24:29,396 --> 01:24:33,033
What else? What else?
Uh, I met these two really cool survivors.

1267
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:36,737
And they taught me all these things.
They live on the surface and...

1268
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:39,105
And, oh, oh, oh!
I met a Mav1s.

1269
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:42,742
- I talked to a real live Mav1s.
- <i>No way! What's she like?</i>

1270
01:24:42,876 --> 01:24:47,047
Uh, she was...
very informative, emotionally, and...

1271
01:24:48,515 --> 01:24:52,019
And I got a dog too, um...

1272
01:24:52,152 --> 01:24:55,590
- <i>Wow, Joel. You got a dog?</i>
- <i>And how is it with Aimee?</i>

1273
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,725
Uh, really...

1274
01:24:58,324 --> 01:24:59,961
really good.

1275
01:25:00,094 --> 01:25:04,431
<i>Joel, you simply surviving
that journey, it's incredible.</i>

1276
01:25:04,564 --> 01:25:06,299
<i>We're proud of you, Joel.</i>

1277
01:25:07,734 --> 01:25:09,969
Man, I really miss you guys.

1278
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:15,176
How is, uh... How is everything back there?
Give me the update.

1279
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:18,145
<i>Not good.
We've had multiple breaches.</i>

1280
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,447
Multiple breaches? What do you mean?
Is everyone okay?

1281
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,582
<i>Not really. I don't think
we can stay here much longer.</i>

1282
01:25:26,286 --> 01:25:27,654
Uh, guys?

1283
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,289
<i>We're surviving for now.</i>

1284
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:32,826
"Surviving for now."
What? Sur... Ray? Hey, guys!

1285
01:25:32,958 --> 01:25:35,630
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit.

1286
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:39,166
Hello, guys, can you hear me?

1287
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,900
Guys?

1288
01:25:51,243 --> 01:25:52,947
I gotta go back.

1289
01:25:53,912 --> 01:25:55,815
What am I doing here?

1290
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:11,699
Purple berries.

1291
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,309
<i>Giant lizard, two stories
high, coming over the wall.</i>

1292
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,580
<i>The lizard-looking ones
can't climb for shit.</i>

1293
01:26:26,712 --> 01:26:28,448
Lying son of a bitch.

1294
01:26:29,882 --> 01:26:31,719
Son of a bitch!

1295
01:26:43,697 --> 01:26:46,300
Y'all like this shit, huh?

1296
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:47,735
Aimee.

1297
01:26:47,868 --> 01:26:49,937
Hey, hey. Aimee, Aimee, Aimee.

1298
01:26:50,069 --> 01:26:51,771
- Joel!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

1299
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:53,873
- I have to talk to you.
- Joel!

1300
01:26:54,975 --> 01:26:56,309
Oh, you're so drunk.

1301
01:26:56,443 --> 01:27:01,681
Hot, super ripped, super awesome
Joely-Joely Dawson!

1302
01:27:01,815 --> 01:27:03,384
Aimee, please.

1303
01:27:03,516 --> 01:27:06,153
This is super important.
I need to talk to you about something.

1304
01:27:06,286 --> 01:27:09,122
You have to get everyone
out of here right now.

1305
01:27:09,256 --> 01:27:12,126
Okay, I think something bad is
about to happen. I'm telling you.

1306
01:27:12,259 --> 01:27:14,793
I can feel it. This is a bad...
This is a bad vibe.

1307
01:27:17,896 --> 01:27:20,835
I think he's planning something.
I don't think he's here to save you.

1308
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:23,237
- Who?
- The yacht captain. He tried to poison me.

1309
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:26,806
Cap. Cap's right there.
He's dancing.

1310
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:31,144
Oh, my... I hate him.
I hate him so much.

1311
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:33,579
Listen, he gave me
these poison berries, okay?

1312
01:27:33,713 --> 01:27:36,048
And I know that the berries are
poison because my dog told me.

1313
01:27:36,182 --> 01:27:37,850
You have a talking dog?

1314
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,085
- No, no, no, Aimee.
- I love dogs!

1315
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:44,759
What'd he say?
Where is the little fella?

1316
01:27:45,759 --> 01:27:46,826
Man down!

1317
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,429
Please.
Please try to listen to me.

1318
01:27:48,561 --> 01:27:50,764
I need your help.
Something's gonna happen.

1319
01:27:50,898 --> 01:27:52,833
Your colony,
they're in danger.

1320
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:53,900
- Joel.
- What?

1321
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:55,502
Joel!

1322
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:07,280
Oh, shit.

1323
01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:09,682
- Aimee? Aimee?
- Joel? Joel, are you okay?

1324
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:11,085
Good morning.

1325
01:28:11,217 --> 01:28:13,118
Joel, I'm sorry about
the fist to your face.

1326
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:16,657
I couldn't have you talking shit about us
on the radio. I didn't wanna mess this up.

1327
01:28:16,789 --> 01:28:19,292
Dana, take care of it.

1328
01:28:20,894 --> 01:28:23,697
Dana, d-don't.
Not the radio tower!

1329
01:28:25,631 --> 01:28:29,002
- What are you doing?
- Are you crazy?

1330
01:28:29,136 --> 01:28:32,373
So, you probably figured out
we're not on a pleasure cruise.

1331
01:28:32,506 --> 01:28:35,643
My crew and I want to thank you
for your generous donations.

1332
01:28:35,775 --> 01:28:37,978
Food, water,
supplies, medicine.

1333
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:39,813
We greatly appreciate it.

1334
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:43,449
It will see us through to the next
helpless colony down the coast.

1335
01:28:43,582 --> 01:28:44,917
He's a food stealer!

1336
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:46,786
- You're right.
- Yeah.

1337
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:50,157
But it's not that simple. The world
is basically devoid of fossil fuels.

1338
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:52,192
Not enough to run
a yacht on, anyway.

1339
01:28:52,326 --> 01:28:55,561
So my crew and I,
we had to improvise just to survive.

1340
01:28:55,695 --> 01:28:59,131
And we found a real special fuel source.
Actually, Rocko did.

1341
01:28:59,265 --> 01:29:01,400
- Didn't ya, big fella?
- Yeah, that was me.

1342
01:29:01,534 --> 01:29:05,840
Ten tons of pure power,
chained to the front of that yacht.

1343
01:29:06,506 --> 01:29:08,108
She's sleeping now.

1344
01:29:09,609 --> 01:29:11,311
She will be hungry soon.

1345
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:20,487
What?

1346
01:29:20,619 --> 01:29:22,355
Well, what can I say?

1347
01:29:24,123 --> 01:29:25,824
Shit gets crazy
in the apocalypse.

1348
01:29:25,958 --> 01:29:27,827
Oh, my God.

1349
01:29:49,448 --> 01:29:52,485
Oh, my God.

1350
01:29:53,386 --> 01:29:54,421
Run!

1351
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:04,398
Rose!

1352
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:10,336
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

1353
01:30:14,207 --> 01:30:17,043
Mkay. Just gotta find a way
to free my hands from the...

1354
01:30:17,176 --> 01:30:19,511
Oh.

1355
01:30:19,645 --> 01:30:22,648
I have to stop these bastards
from taking our stuff!

1356
01:30:22,783 --> 01:30:24,351
Oh, my...

1357
01:30:25,451 --> 01:30:27,287
You traveled 85 miles
across hell.

1358
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,189
I think
I can stop three assholes.

1359
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:30,624
- You get the crab!
- What?

1360
01:30:32,759 --> 01:30:34,994
This is desperate.

1361
01:30:40,701 --> 01:30:43,203
Aimee?

1362
01:31:16,136 --> 01:31:18,438
Holy shit.

1363
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,573
Holy shit.

1364
01:32:26,506 --> 01:32:28,207
No, no, no, no, no!

1365
01:32:36,682 --> 01:32:38,685
Boy? Boy!

1366
01:32:40,287 --> 01:32:42,489
Boy! Hey!

1367
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:48,761
Dana? Shoot the dog.

1368
01:33:05,811 --> 01:33:07,113
Aimee!

1369
01:33:08,814 --> 01:33:10,451
No!

1370
01:33:12,284 --> 01:33:14,954
Rocko? Time to go. Let's mo...

1371
01:33:18,757 --> 01:33:20,326
Oh, no, you don't.

1372
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,331
Boy! I need you
to listen to me right now.

1373
01:33:24,463 --> 01:33:27,501
You see over there?
Go get Aimee.

1374
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:28,967
Let's move it!

1375
01:33:29,101 --> 01:33:30,737
Go now. Now. Now!

1376
01:33:30,869 --> 01:33:32,538
I'm sorry I yelled at you!

1377
01:33:38,845 --> 01:33:40,513
Move.

1378
01:33:47,087 --> 01:33:49,088
Okay, crab, you want some of...

1379
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:53,359
Whoa!

1380
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:02,769
Okay! Whoa! Whoa!

1381
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,905
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen.
You don't wanna do this.

1382
01:34:15,448 --> 01:34:17,584
Oh, no!

1383
01:34:25,925 --> 01:34:27,461
- Joel!
- Aimee!

1384
01:34:27,594 --> 01:34:30,697
Aimee! Aimee, throw me the cannon!
I know how to kill it!

1385
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:53,020
You can always tell in the eyes.

1386
01:34:53,153 --> 01:34:56,456
- What are you doing? Shoot it!
- Shoot it! What are you waiting for?

1387
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:59,726
- Kill it!
- Goddamn it, shoot it!

1388
01:35:01,027 --> 01:35:02,261
Needle through water.

1389
01:35:05,765 --> 01:35:07,066
Cap?

1390
01:35:15,073 --> 01:35:18,244
You're free.

1391
01:35:49,242 --> 01:35:51,244
Oh, my God.

1392
01:35:58,618 --> 01:36:01,655
Oh, shit, we're gonna die.
We're dying.

1393
01:36:08,927 --> 01:36:11,163
No!

1394
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:33,619
That was amazing.

1395
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:34,953
What? Uh...

1396
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,157
- Amazing? Me?
- Yeah.

1397
01:36:37,289 --> 01:36:38,692
You thought I was...

1398
01:36:46,265 --> 01:36:48,034
- Thank you, Joel.
- Yeah?

1399
01:36:48,167 --> 01:36:52,005
Yeah, well, I would've done it
different, but... you did all right.

1400
01:36:52,137 --> 01:36:53,974
Oh. Okay.

1401
01:36:54,106 --> 01:36:56,609
Sorry. Yeah, just...

1402
01:36:56,743 --> 01:36:58,477
That's looking better.
Take care of it.

1403
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:00,079
- Bye now.
- Bye, guys.

1404
01:37:01,381 --> 01:37:03,850
- Can you move this? Yeah.
- Aimee.

1405
01:37:07,587 --> 01:37:09,422
- Hey.
- Hey. Um...

1406
01:37:09,555 --> 01:37:12,925
I gotta get back to my colony,
see if they're okay.

1407
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:14,961
Right, yeah. Yeah.

1408
01:37:15,094 --> 01:37:18,265
Some friends of mine told me that
there's a place in the mountains,

1409
01:37:18,398 --> 01:37:20,266
I guess,
that's safe from the monsters.

1410
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:22,868
So maybe
we'll all head there.

1411
01:37:23,002 --> 01:37:24,171
Oh.

1412
01:37:24,304 --> 01:37:28,240
Um, it was really cool to just...
to see you in action,

1413
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:33,612
and... I don't know, how you take
care of all these people, and then...

1414
01:37:33,746 --> 01:37:36,949
- Oh.
- I'm so glad you came.

1415
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,154
I gotta go.

1416
01:37:42,287 --> 01:37:44,022
I'm worried about 'em.

1417
01:37:44,157 --> 01:37:45,559
Yeah.

1418
01:37:46,626 --> 01:37:49,463
But I had something
for you. Um...

1419
01:37:50,063 --> 01:37:51,965
Oh, my God.

1420
01:37:52,097 --> 01:37:53,265
Crocodile Carl?

1421
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:55,467
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

1422
01:37:55,601 --> 01:37:58,704
Thought you should
have him back finally.

1423
01:37:59,872 --> 01:38:00,906
Here, uh...

1424
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:04,644
- No, I can't take that. You need it.
- No, no, no.

1425
01:38:04,777 --> 01:38:07,547
I want you to take it.
It'd mean a lot to me.

1426
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:09,649
Really, take it.

1427
01:38:11,117 --> 01:38:14,354
I got it all up here, anyway.
So I can always make copies.

1428
01:38:14,487 --> 01:38:17,056
Thanks for
inspiring me to...

1429
01:38:18,356 --> 01:38:20,393
take this trip.

1430
01:38:20,525 --> 01:38:22,496
It's the best decision
I ever made.

1431
01:38:23,662 --> 01:38:27,065
All right,
uh, I'm gonna go.

1432
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,234
- Yeah.
- Boy, come on!

1433
01:38:29,368 --> 01:38:31,337
Um...

1434
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:33,939
- Uh, be careful.
- Yeah, you, too.

1435
01:38:35,608 --> 01:38:37,411
- Bye, Aimee.
- Bye.

1436
01:39:00,432 --> 01:39:01,935
That was...

1437
01:39:02,068 --> 01:39:04,003
- Great.
- Yeah.

1438
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,046
I'll come find you.

1439
01:39:15,381 --> 01:39:16,849
You better.

1440
01:39:21,354 --> 01:39:22,588
Okay.

1441
01:39:31,997 --> 01:39:34,033
<i>My name is Joel Dawson.</i>

1442
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:38,672
<i>I'm 24 years old,
and I survived seven days on the surface.</i>

1443
01:39:46,645 --> 01:39:48,215
<i>Twice, actually.</i>

1444
01:40:00,059 --> 01:40:01,293
- Joel?
- Joel?

1445
01:40:01,427 --> 01:40:03,662
You guys! Hey!

1446
01:40:03,796 --> 01:40:06,065
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1447
01:40:19,244 --> 01:40:22,481
I'm alive because of the
generosity of a few strangers

1448
01:40:22,614 --> 01:40:25,885
and the kindness
of a great dog.

1449
01:40:27,653 --> 01:40:30,088
<i>My colony and I
are headed to the mountains.</i>

1450
01:40:30,221 --> 01:40:32,992
<i>There's supposed to be
less monsters there.</i>

1451
01:40:33,126 --> 01:40:37,496
<i>And don't get me wrong.
The surface is a dangerous place.</i>

1452
01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:41,434
<i>But I don't think hiding
underground is the answer anymore.</i>

1453
01:40:41,568 --> 01:40:46,773
<i>There is a great big, beautiful,
inspiring world out there.</i>

1454
01:40:46,905 --> 01:40:50,609
<i>And I know you think it
might be impossible, but it's not.</i>

1455
01:40:50,743 --> 01:40:52,911
<i>If I can survive out here,
anybody can.</i>

1456
01:40:53,046 --> 01:40:55,280
<i>It's like a good friend
once told me.</i>

1457
01:40:55,413 --> 01:40:58,184
<i>Good instincts are earned
by making mistakes.</i>

1458
01:40:58,317 --> 01:41:00,786
<i>If you're lucky enough
to survive a few mistakes,</i>

1459
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,587
<i>you're gonna
do all right out here.</i>

1460
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:06,625
<i>In this recording, you'll find
everything I know about our new world.</i>

1461
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,628
<i>Most of this
I had to learn the hard way.</i>

1462
01:41:08,761 --> 01:41:11,063
<i>Hopefully, it'll make your way
a little easier.</i>

1463
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:14,467
<i>So crank open that hatch.</i>

1464
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:15,935
Okay, come on.

1465
01:41:16,069 --> 01:41:19,972
<i>Breathe some fresh air.
Go. Live your life.</i>

1466
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:24,176
<i>It won't be easy,
but it'll be worth it.</i>

1467
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:29,983
<i>I traveled 85 miles to find what I had
been missing below ground for seven years</i>

1468
01:41:30,115 --> 01:41:32,585
<i>was right above my head
this whole time.</i>

1469
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:34,420
<i>And it's incredible.</i>

1470
01:41:35,454 --> 01:41:38,457
<i>Oh, and one last thing.
Don't settle.</i>

1471
01:41:38,591 --> 01:41:42,762
<i>You don't have to.
Not even at the end of the world.</i>

1472
01:41:50,636 --> 01:41:52,338
<i>Signing off,</i>

1473
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:54,239
<i>Joel Dawson.</i>

1474
01:42:22,801 --> 01:42:25,270
"Don't settle"?
That's my line.

1475
01:42:25,404 --> 01:42:28,173
It's a long journey, kid.
I hope you know what you're doing.

1476
01:42:28,306 --> 01:42:31,109
He definitely doesn't.
Snow Spiders will probably get him.

1477
01:42:31,243 --> 01:42:32,744
That's not a good way to go.

1478
01:42:32,877 --> 01:42:34,246
They will tear him apart.

1479
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:37,417
- Nah, he'll figure it out.
- Possibly.
