3
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,002
Come on, Peter.

4
00:02:49,755 --> 00:02:52,759
Wake up. Peter. Wake up.

5
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:55,611
Here's your suit.

6
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,532
Do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night?

7
00:03:04,005 --> 00:03:05,106
I don't know.

8
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:09,532
Come on, Peter. Get up.

9
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,433
Oh, Charlie.
For God's sake, come on!

10
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,820
It was freezing last night!

11
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,915
That's how you get pneumonia.

12
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,472
That's okay.

13
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,946
Okay, come on.
Let's go. We're late.

14
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,796
Your mother's
in the car already.

15
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:00,670
Um...

16
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:06,741
It's heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today.

17
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:11,540
Um, I know my mom
would be very touched

18
00:04:11,944 --> 00:04:14,715
and probably a little
suspicious...

19
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,607
um, to see this turnout. So.

20
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:27,172
My mother was a very secretive
and private woman.

21
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:29,213
She had private rituals,

22
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:32,303
private friends,
private anxieties.

23
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,375
It honestly feels
like a betrayal

24
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,627
just to be standing here
talking about her.

25
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:46,038
<i>She was a very difficult woman
to read.</i>

26
00:04:46,963 --> 00:04:49,849
<i>If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her,</i>

27
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,226
<i>and God forbid
you tried to confront that.</i>

28
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:57,469
<i>But when her life
was unpolluted,</i>

29
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:59,975
<i>she could be
the sweetest, warmest,</i>

30
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:02,030
<i>most loving person in the world.</i>

31
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,784
She was also
incredibly stubborn,

32
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:08,390
which maybe, explains me.

33
00:05:10,406 --> 00:05:13,009
You could always count on her
to always have the answer.

34
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,078
And if she ever was mistaken,

35
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,387
and well,
that was your opinion...

36
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:24,239
And you were wrong.

37
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:49,440
There aren't nuts in that?

38
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:51,424
- No.
- Good.

39
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,806
Does that have nuts? 'Cause
we don't have the EpiPen.

40
00:05:54,808 --> 00:05:55,820
I know.

41
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,600
Hello, Rexy! Good dog.

42
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,211
Shoes off, everybody.

43
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,770
Charlie, shoes off.

44
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:41,440
It does feel weird.

45
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,008
Yeah.

46
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,858
Should I be sadder?

47
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:51,336
You should be
whatever you are. It'll come.

48
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:14,926
Hey, how's it going?

49
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,670
Mmm, just working.

50
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,058
Taking a break
from avoiding the show.

51
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:28,989
So, you still toiling away
at the hospice?

52
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:32,133
Yeah, between this
and the, uh, preschool.

53
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:36,929
So what's our deadline now?
Seven months?

54
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:40,266
- Six and a half.
- Ooh, coming up.

55
00:07:41,782 --> 00:07:43,618
Any ideas for titles?

56
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:52,460
Come in.

57
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:54,632
Hey...

58
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,784
- Goodnight, kiddo.
- Goodnight.

59
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:02,941
Are you, uh... Are you feeling
okay about everything?

60
00:08:03,027 --> 00:08:04,903
Yeah. Fine.

61
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,019
A little sad?

62
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:10,371
Mmm...

63
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:13,598
Yeah, I get it. I know.

64
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,578
- Goodnight.
- Night.

65
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:16,935
Love you.

66
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,165
Who's this?

67
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,183
That's Grandma?

68
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,165
You know
you were her favorite, right?

69
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,608
Even when
you were a little baby,

70
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,333
she wouldn't let me feed you

71
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:56,007
because she needed to feed you.

72
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,723
Drove me crazy.

73
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,757
She wanted me to be a boy.

74
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:07,759
You know, I was a tomboy
when I was growing up.

75
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:12,586
I hated dresses
and dolls and pink.

76
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,215
Who's gonna take care of me?

77
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,373
Um, excuse me.

78
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,474
You don't think
I'm gonna take care of you?

79
00:09:22,887 --> 00:09:24,435
But when you die.

80
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,716
Well, then...

81
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,495
Dad will take care of you.

82
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:34,140
Or Peter.

83
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,717
You never cried as a baby.

84
00:09:54,588 --> 00:09:56,089
You know that?

85
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,579
Even when you were born.

86
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,696
Did you feel
like you wanted to cry today?

87
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,969
You think it might feel
like a relief?

88
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:44,726
Goodnight, sweetheart.

89
00:12:36,682 --> 00:12:37,929
Mom?

90
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,939
I just scared myself
in the workshop.

91
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:24,528
With... With what?

92
00:13:29,702 --> 00:13:30,771
No.

93
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:53,821
Are you done?

94
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:56,991
Almost.

95
00:13:58,223 --> 00:14:01,673
So, maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz.

96
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:02,921
What do you think?

97
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,374
- Okay.
- Okay.

98
00:14:14,975 --> 00:14:17,380
Oh, my God! What was that?

99
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,684
So, if we go by the rule

100
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:36,094
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw,

101
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:38,716
what is Heracles' flaw?

102
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,114
Arrogance.

103
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:43,706
Okay. Why?

104
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:46,894
Because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs

105
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,856
that are literally handed
to him the entire play.

106
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:52,534
Okay, interesting.

107
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,846
So he thinks he has control.

108
00:14:54,922 --> 00:14:56,345
But let's all remember,

109
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:59,479
Sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional,

110
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:03,508
meaning, Heracles never had
any choice, right?

111
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,404
So does that make it
more tragic or less tragic

112
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,713
that if he has a choice?

113
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,758
- Less.
- Okay.

114
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:12,758
- Why?
- Because.

115
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,329
Care to weigh in, Peter?

116
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:21,024
Um, about which part?

117
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:24,366
I think it's more tragic

118
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:26,144
because if it's all
just inevitable,

119
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:28,565
then that means that
the characters had no hope.

120
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:29,475
They never had hope

121
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,365
because they're all just,
like, hopeless.

122
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,326
They're all like pawns

123
00:15:32,328 --> 00:15:34,886
in this horrible,
hopeless machine.

124
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,888
- Hello!
- Hi!

125
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:34,883
Did you go up in my mom's room?

126
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:37,262
No.

127
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,849
Mmm. Door was open.

128
00:17:45,863 --> 00:17:46,863
Hello?

129
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:48,477
Sorry. I know it's irrational.

130
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,243
- No problem.
- Thank you.

131
00:17:51,248 --> 00:17:53,395
Hey, Dad. It's the cemetery.

132
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,846
About what?

133
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:56,904
Let me see.

134
00:17:57,604 --> 00:18:00,324
Hello? Yes.

135
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,095
What does that mean?

136
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:11,179
Desecrated?

137
00:18:15,747 --> 00:18:17,450
But it's only been a week.

138
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,828
Yes, okay, yes. Sure.

139
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:25,400
All right. I understand. Yes...

140
00:18:25,456 --> 00:18:28,365
Uh, why don't I call you back?
Yes. Goodbye.

141
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:29,542
What was it?

142
00:18:31,394 --> 00:18:33,815
Uh, just some billing crap.

143
00:18:35,099 --> 00:18:37,523
Okay, well, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna go see a movie.

144
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:39,757
Okay.

145
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:07,942
He would say

146
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:11,312
"I'm a burden, I'm a burden,
I'm a burden."

147
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:17,759
And I would tell him, "No, no."

148
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,635
But yes, he was a burden.

149
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,451
Now we've set aside
some time for any newcomers

150
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,288
who might like to speak.

151
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:35,064
So, anyone.

152
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:38,531
If it's your first
or second time with us,

153
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,172
the floor is open.

154
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:46,780
Yes. Would you like to...

155
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:48,090
Maybe not.

156
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,376
Okay. No pressure.

157
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,165
My name's Annie.

158
00:20:00,392 --> 00:20:01,698
Hi, Annie.

159
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,239
My mom died a week ago.

160
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,720
So I'm just here for trying it.

161
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,316
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,

162
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:15,475
but I came to these
a couple years ago.

163
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:18,627
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...

164
00:20:20,045 --> 00:20:22,016
I guess it helped. So, um...

165
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:28,602
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.

166
00:20:28,684 --> 00:20:31,030
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,

167
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:33,956
so it really wasn't a huge blow.

168
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:39,494
But I did love her.

169
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:42,378
And she didn't have
an easy life.

170
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,568
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.

171
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,254
And dementia.

172
00:20:47,356 --> 00:20:51,394
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,

173
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:54,296
um, because he had
psychotic depression

174
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:55,094
and he starved himself,

175
00:20:55,096 --> 00:20:57,364
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.

176
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:58,955
And then there's my brother.

177
00:20:59,105 --> 00:21:01,007
My older brother
had schizophrenia

178
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:02,338
and when he was 16

179
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:04,115
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom

180
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,827
and of course
the suicide note blamed her

181
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:09,267
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.

182
00:21:13,013 --> 00:21:14,949
That was my mom's life.

183
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,651
And then she lived in our house

184
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,368
at the end before hospice.

185
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:31,924
We weren't even talking
before that.

186
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:33,989
I mean, we were
and then we weren't.

187
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,885
And then we were.

188
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:40,351
She's completely manipulative.

189
00:21:40,387 --> 00:21:43,776
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,

190
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:46,099
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.

191
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:47,266
I didn't let her
anywhere near me

192
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:48,922
when I had my first, my son,

193
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,791
which is why I gave her
my daughter,

194
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:53,257
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.

195
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:56,353
And I just...
I felt guilty again.

196
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:57,835
I felt guilty again.

197
00:21:58,092 --> 00:21:59,135
When she got sick,

198
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:01,378
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,

199
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,019
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.

200
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:14,177
And I just don't want to put
any more stress on my family.

201
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,811
I'm not even really sure
if they could...

202
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,225
Could give me that support.

203
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:27,558
And I just...
I just feel like...

204
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:33,122
I just sometimes
feel like it's all ruined.

205
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:40,095
And then I realize
that I am to blame.

206
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:43,740
Or not that I'm to blame,

207
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:48,558
but I am blamed! I'm...

208
00:22:49,746 --> 00:22:53,433
And what do you think
you feel blamed for?

209
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,159
I don't know.

210
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,324
<i>Hey, what's going on in town</i>

211
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:05,145
<i>anyway, Mister?
A convention or something?</i>

212
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:05,855
<i>What?</i>

213
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:07,087
<i>Well, those clothes
you're wearing.</i>

214
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,065
<i>I talked to a guy this morning</i>

215
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:10,032
<i>who was wearing
the same kind of outfit.</i>

216
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:12,424
<i>Maybe it's the guy
you're looking for, huh?</i>

217
00:23:12,426 --> 00:23:13,793
<i>You spoke to him?</i>

218
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:16,163
<i>What did he tell you?
Where did he go?</i>

219
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:17,520
<i>Hey, what's the matter with you?</i>

220
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:18,759
<i>Hey, take your hands off me.</i>

221
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:20,289
<i>You will tell me
what he said to you!</i>

222
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:21,375
<i>Well why should I?</i>

223
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:23,026
<i>Hey, who do you think
you are anyway?</i>

224
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:26,589
<i>He came in with the dog tags!</i>

225
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,874
<i>Wanted to know about the address</i>

226
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,085
<i>and I told him how to find it.</i>

227
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:30,126
Where?

228
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:38,846
Hey, um, do you think
I could maybe borrow

229
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:40,382
one of the cars tonight?

230
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:43,069
Why? Where are you going?

231
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:45,980
Oh, just like
a school barbecue thing.

232
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:47,966
Oh, so you're not eating
with us?

233
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,851
No, I was still gonna eat here.

234
00:25:49,975 --> 00:25:51,392
Well, you can eat there
if you want. I just didn't...

235
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:54,016
No, no, no. I'm gonna
eat here. I just, I...

236
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,774
Just be going to hang out.

237
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,561
No drinking?

238
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:05,122
We're not even old enough
to get drinks if we wanted to.

239
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:08,298
Well, that's a crock. I'm just
asking if you're drinking.

240
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:10,346
Well, I just answered no.

241
00:26:12,091 --> 00:26:13,770
You gonna take your sister?

242
00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:18,131
Uh... Does she want to go?

243
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:21,433
Have you asked her?

244
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,288
Charlie?

245
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,778
Charlie!

246
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:04,104
I mean, what are you doing?
Leaving the house barefoot?

247
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,326
Are you some kind of idiot?

248
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:08,035
You can't roam around
with no shoes and no coat.

249
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:09,971
- I want Grandma.
- Oh.

250
00:27:10,579 --> 00:27:13,105
Oh, what?
You're angry with me now?

251
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:18,953
You are going to this...
Hey, socks off.

252
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:20,896
You're going to this party
with your brother.

253
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,496
What party?

254
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:25,209
Some school hangout
with other kids.

255
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:27,544
That's okay.

256
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:30,667
No, it's not okay. You're going.

257
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,263
- Why?
- Because it'll be fun.

258
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,251
Because you'll get to hang out
with other kids.

259
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,527
- With who?
- With your...

260
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:37,279
With your brother.
With other kids.

261
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,201
- Fine.
- Good. You're going.

262
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,236
- She's going with you.
- Great.

263
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,132
Now this really means
no drinking.

264
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:49,970
Yeah, I really wasn't going to.

265
00:29:26,342 --> 00:29:27,821
<i>Whoa. Hi.</i>

266
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:30,550
Oh. Hi.

267
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,545
How's the party?

268
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:35,909
Why? You wanna know
if you should come?

269
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:38,320
Uh, yeah. What do ya think?

270
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,120
Either way.

271
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:47,142
Hey, do you happen
to smoke at all?

272
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:48,817
I have really good weed.

273
00:29:55,231 --> 00:29:57,500
- The other room has a bong.
- Sick.

274
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,579
Do you wanna wait out here
for a second?

275
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,644
- No.
- Charlie, please, just...

276
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:08,529
It'll be two minutes
and then we can hang out.

277
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:11,543
You can draw.
Please, Charlie. I'm...

278
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:15,287
Oh, shit, look. They're
giving out chocolate cake.

279
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:16,546
Not to everyone.

280
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,887
Yes to everyone. It's a party.

281
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:19,929
- I don't know anyone.
- Nobody does.

282
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,738
Just walk over and stand there
and they'll give you a piece.

283
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:24,755
Hurry up. They're gonna
run out. Come on, Charlie.

284
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:33,844
Hey, guys. Peter has weed.

285
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,378
That was your sister downstairs?

286
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,718
Yeah. Charlie.

287
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:04,909
Is your sister hot?

288
00:31:07,712 --> 00:31:09,702
I actually saw her
drawing me last week.

289
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:10,834
Oh, yeah?

290
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,628
Yeah. She made me look retarded.

291
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:15,299
Yeah. That's Charlie.

292
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,080
Peter?

293
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:49,139
Charlie.

294
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:51,762
What's up?

295
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:57,464
Are you okay?

296
00:31:59,063 --> 00:32:00,933
It's hard to breathe.

297
00:32:02,595 --> 00:32:03,662
What do you mean?

298
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,984
I think my throat's
getting bigger.

299
00:32:56,411 --> 00:32:58,571
It's okay, Charlie. We're
almost at the hospital, okay?

300
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:18,557
Charlie!

301
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:39,794
You okay.

302
00:34:42,923 --> 00:34:44,057
Okay.

303
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:54,365
Okay, good. They're home.

304
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,095
Good.

305
00:36:53,104 --> 00:36:55,264
I'm running out
for some balsam wood.

306
00:36:55,266 --> 00:36:56,492
You want anything?

307
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:58,994
I'm good, sweetheart.
Drive safe.

308
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:01,675
Okay. Back in 20.

309
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,697
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

310
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:51,511
Oh, no. I can't, I can't...

311
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:57,055
I just want to die!

312
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,829
Oh, God. It hurts too much!

313
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,969
I just need to die!

314
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,920
Charlie!

315
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:23,862
Oh, God.

316
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:33,146
Oh, Charlie!

317
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:08,344
Hey, are you guys friends
with Becky on Facebook?

318
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:10,648
You're friends with Becky?

319
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,773
I said "Facebook friends."

320
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,490
But seriously,
you see her statuses, bro?

321
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,279
Oh, my God, dude, I know.

322
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:20,813
- Like, every ten seconds.
- For real.

323
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:24,614
Oh, dude, what about, uh,
fucking... Let me hit that.

324
00:42:24,677 --> 00:42:26,747
- Brian?
- Brian and his girlfriend.

325
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,056
He calls her something...

326
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:30,223
He calls her something really
goofy, dude. What does he...

327
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,345
Oh, he calls her princess.

328
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:36,137
Who fucking calls
their girlfriend "princess"?

329
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:37,852
What the fuck?

330
00:42:37,906 --> 00:42:38,688
Dude, he's like,

331
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,419
"I'm picking up
my princess from the airport."

332
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,678
Fucking eating cous...
What the fuck.

333
00:42:43,741 --> 00:42:44,508
It's couscous.

334
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:47,694
Couscous. I don't give a shit,
"with my princess."

335
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:49,029
You hit that shit?

336
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,186
Who's his girlfriend?

337
00:42:50,242 --> 00:42:53,708
Some, uh, some fucking
stupid college chick.

338
00:42:54,966 --> 00:42:55,966
Oh, damn.

339
00:42:56,005 --> 00:42:58,388
I wanna fucking stupid
college princess, bro.

340
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:00,168
Yeah.

341
00:43:00,232 --> 00:43:01,970
Oh, hey dude. Dude, dude, dude.

342
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,190
Are you... Are you all right?

343
00:43:05,928 --> 00:43:08,597
I think I'm having a...
Like a reaction.

344
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:10,180
My throat is...

345
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:12,017
I think my throat
is getting bigger.

346
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:15,689
Dude, it's just it's...
It's just weed.

347
00:43:15,874 --> 00:43:17,595
Chill, man. It's all right.

348
00:43:17,768 --> 00:43:19,550
Just hold my hand. Hold on.

349
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:59,760
Uh, I'm so sorry
to chase you down.

350
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:02,409
Uh, were you not
coming in, or...

351
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:06,412
I... No, I just, um...
I forgot something.

352
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:09,353
Oh, okay, sorry.
Sorry, I just...

353
00:45:09,398 --> 00:45:11,928
I recognized you
from a few months ago.

354
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:16,543
Oh, God.
I feel very silly. I'm Joan.

355
00:45:17,806 --> 00:45:19,142
Hi.

356
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:20,806
Are you doing better?

357
00:45:21,983 --> 00:45:24,518
- What?
- After your mother?

358
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:27,640
What? No, no. That's not...

359
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:33,140
My, um...
My daughter was killed.

360
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:36,941
Oh. I'm...

361
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:39,574
I'm so, so sorry.

362
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:43,306
Oh, would you like to
come in with me?

363
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:45,317
Or we could even
just have a coffee.

364
00:45:45,363 --> 00:45:48,066
Uh, I'm sorry. Really, I, um...

365
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:50,665
I can't...
I really did forget something.

366
00:45:50,717 --> 00:45:52,125
My son died.

367
00:45:53,911 --> 00:45:55,378
Oh.

368
00:45:57,978 --> 00:45:59,513
I'm so sorry.

369
00:46:00,085 --> 00:46:01,787
How old was yours?

370
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:06,539
Thirteen.

371
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:09,904
God. That's awful.

372
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:17,239
My son and my grandson
drowned four months ago.

373
00:46:17,682 --> 00:46:19,377
The little one was seven.

374
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:21,165
Oh, my God!

375
00:46:21,958 --> 00:46:25,121
I've been coming here
for a couple of months now.

376
00:46:26,145 --> 00:46:27,765
And it has helped.

377
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,489
It doesn't
make it easier obviously,

378
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:34,984
but sometimes
it makes it less lonely.

379
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:38,475
Okay.

380
00:46:38,565 --> 00:46:41,301
And now I'm about to
embarrass myself but, uh,

381
00:46:43,172 --> 00:46:47,610
if you need someone
to talk to...

382
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,968
'Cause we all do.

383
00:46:56,111 --> 00:46:57,713
If you need it.

384
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:03,038
Okay.

385
00:47:03,218 --> 00:47:05,436
Thank you. Really.

386
00:47:08,135 --> 00:47:09,217
Okay.

387
00:47:13,982 --> 00:47:15,195
Bye-bye.

388
00:47:28,124 --> 00:47:29,642
- Hey.
- Hey.

389
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:33,522
- I'm going to bed.
- Where were you?

390
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:37,433
At the movies. Gonna go to bed.

391
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,618
Okay. I'll come up with you.

392
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,347
Okay.

393
00:48:01,591 --> 00:48:03,740
I'll be right back.

394
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:07,275
No you won't.
You're taking the blanket.

395
00:48:08,114 --> 00:48:09,582
I can't sleep.

396
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:13,548
It's freezing out there.

397
00:48:14,598 --> 00:48:16,078
Well, the heater's up there.

398
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:18,738
Okay.

399
00:48:20,547 --> 00:48:21,747
Is that okay?

400
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,818
If it gets too cold,
come back in.

401
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:32,336
I just need to sleep.

402
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:02,922
Shit.

403
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:08,846
Oh, Annie. You came.

404
00:51:08,848 --> 00:51:10,261
It's a little earlier
than we said.

405
00:51:10,263 --> 00:51:12,622
Ah, you're perfect.
Come in. Come in.

406
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:22,333
Uh, your welcome mat.

407
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,030
Ah! It's kind of cute, huh?

408
00:51:25,032 --> 00:51:27,809
Yeah. My mother used to
embroider ones just like that.

409
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:30,145
Did she really?
Isn't that funny?

410
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:33,094
Please come in. Sit.

411
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,213
First there's the...

412
00:51:37,323 --> 00:51:39,282
The smell of something wrong.

413
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,245
And then the body.

414
00:51:46,305 --> 00:51:52,146
Covered in black blood,
like tar.

415
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,250
And her head wasn't there
so I couldn't see her face.

416
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:03,762
But they were gone.

417
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,915
And her hands,
and her little finger nails.

418
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:46,857
How is your relationship
with your son?

419
00:52:48,222 --> 00:52:50,280
- Peter?
- Hmm.

420
00:52:51,464 --> 00:52:53,575
Oh, God. Um...

421
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:58,481
Okay, I sleepwalk.

422
00:53:00,965 --> 00:53:03,729
I mean, I haven't done it
in years, but, um...

423
00:53:04,444 --> 00:53:07,477
A couple years ago, I woke up

424
00:53:08,008 --> 00:53:11,057
and I was standing
next to Peter in Charlie's bed

425
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:14,204
when they shared a room.

426
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,642
And they were

427
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:22,546
completely covered
in paint thinner.

428
00:53:24,023 --> 00:53:25,626
And so was I.

429
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,070
From head to toe.

430
00:53:31,514 --> 00:53:34,192
And I was standing there
with a box of matches

431
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:35,975
and an empty can
of paint thinner.

432
00:53:38,512 --> 00:53:40,241
And I woke myself up
striking the match,

433
00:53:40,282 --> 00:53:43,475
which also woke Peter up,
and he started to scream.

434
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,217
And I immediately put
the match out.

435
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:49,385
Like, immediately.

436
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:51,940
I mean, I was just
as shocked as he was.

437
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:56,108
And it was impossible
to convince them

438
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:58,232
that it was just sleepwalking,

439
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:02,224
which of course it was, but...

440
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,977
The timing was awful.

441
00:54:05,047 --> 00:54:07,856
Peter and I had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase,

442
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:10,928
just forever arguing
about nothing, such...

443
00:54:13,524 --> 00:54:15,026
Frivolous stuff.

444
00:54:18,348 --> 00:54:20,604
And Peter always held it
against me.

445
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:22,984
And there was nothing I can say

446
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:25,082
and nothing I can do

447
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:28,571
because it happened.

448
00:54:31,824 --> 00:54:33,625
While I was asleep.

449
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:40,076
Hey! That was quick.

450
00:54:40,755 --> 00:54:42,522
Did you bike all the way here?

451
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,883
Um, no. Actually my friend
drove me home.

452
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:48,082
Oh, uh, by the way,
Peter, have you, um...

453
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:51,192
Have you signed up for that,
uh, SAT prep course?

454
00:54:51,257 --> 00:54:52,085
I'll do it tomorrow.

455
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:53,624
Yeah, you know what,
you gotta do that

456
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,160
because it's coming up.

457
00:55:31,354 --> 00:55:33,124
Jesus Christ, Annie.

458
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:37,101
You're not planning on letting
him see that, are you?

459
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,788
- Who?
- Peter.

460
00:55:38,858 --> 00:55:40,676
How do you think he's gonna
feel when he sees that?

461
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:42,303
What? It's not about him.

462
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:43,420
Oh, no?

463
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:45,820
No. It's a neutral view
of the accident.

464
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,417
Are you, uh, are you
coming down to dinner?

465
00:55:57,473 --> 00:55:58,079
I'm making dinner.

466
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,416
No, I made the dinner.
I came to get you.

467
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,210
Come, stay, whatever you want.
I don't really give a shit.

468
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,116
This is really good, Dad.

469
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,529
Thanks, buddy.

470
00:57:13,912 --> 00:57:15,431
You okay, Mom?

471
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,187
What?

472
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:24,387
Is there something on your mind?

473
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:28,631
Is there something on your mind?

474
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:36,063
It just seems like there might
be something you wanna say.

475
00:57:36,065 --> 00:57:37,480
- Peter...
- Like what?

476
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:39,692
I mean, why would I wanna
say something

477
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:41,631
so I can watch you sneer at me.

478
00:57:42,978 --> 00:57:44,888
Sneer at you?
I don't ever sneer at you.

479
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:46,041
Oh, sweetie. You don't have to.

480
00:57:46,065 --> 00:57:47,491
You get your point across.

481
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:49,578
Okay, so fine. Then say
what you wanna say then.

482
00:57:49,642 --> 00:57:50,323
Peter.

483
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:54,826
I don't wanna say anything.
I've tried saying things.

484
00:57:54,865 --> 00:57:56,310
Okay, so try again.
Release yourself.

485
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,884
Oh, release you, you mean.

486
00:57:57,931 --> 00:58:00,007
Yeah, fine. Release me.
Just say it.

487
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:01,390
Just fucking say it!

488
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:03,860
Don't you swear at me,
you little shit!

489
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:05,814
Don't you ever
raise your voice at me!

490
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:07,698
I am your mother!

491
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,199
Do you understand?

492
00:58:09,201 --> 00:58:13,245
All I do is worry and slave
and defend you.

493
00:58:13,247 --> 00:58:17,010
And all I get back is that
fucking face on your face.

494
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,328
So full of disdain
and resentment

495
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,250
and always so annoyed.

496
00:58:22,307 --> 00:58:24,368
Well, now your sister is dead.

497
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,195
And I know you miss her,
and I know it was an accident

498
00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:29,559
and I know you're in pain.

499
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:31,635
And I wish I could take that
away for you.

500
00:58:31,698 --> 00:58:34,392
I wish I could shield you
from the knowledge

501
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:38,449
that you did what you did,
but your sister is dead!

502
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:40,931
She's gone forever!

503
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:44,712
And what a waste.

504
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:47,423
If it could have maybe brought
us together or something.

505
00:58:47,477 --> 00:58:49,464
If you could have just said,
"I'm sorry",

506
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:51,574
or faced up to what happened.

507
00:58:51,636 --> 00:58:54,139
Maybe then we could do
something with this.

508
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:56,875
But you can't take
responsibility for anything!

509
00:58:56,956 --> 00:58:59,717
So now I can't accept...

510
00:58:59,818 --> 00:59:03,928
And I can't forgive because...

511
00:59:06,473 --> 00:59:09,731
Because nobody admits
anything they've done!

512
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:42,798
What about you, Mom?

513
00:59:48,537 --> 00:59:50,404
She didn't wanna go
to the party.

514
00:59:52,432 --> 00:59:54,233
So why was she there?

515
00:59:55,765 --> 00:59:58,167
All right. We're
stopping this right now.

516
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:01,083
That's it.

517
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:06,467
I said stop right now.

518
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:07,770
Fine!

519
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,390
Fine.

520
01:01:30,057 --> 01:01:31,291
Joan?

521
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:34,839
Oh! Annie!

522
01:01:34,841 --> 01:01:38,005
- Hey.
- Oh!

523
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,237
- Annie!
- Hi!

524
01:01:41,556 --> 01:01:43,334
Oh, my!

525
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,061
How are you?

526
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:47,262
- Oh, Annie! I'm...
- Are you okay?

527
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:53,297
I'm... I am, yes.
I'm really good.

528
01:01:53,299 --> 01:01:57,408
- I'm really, really...
- Okay.

529
01:01:58,276 --> 01:02:01,931
Something's...
Something happened, Annie,

530
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:06,795
and I feel completely
turned around.

531
01:02:06,884 --> 01:02:09,157
What happened?

532
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:11,078
I don't even know
if I should say.

533
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,322
What do you mean?

534
01:02:12,324 --> 01:02:14,060
You're gonna think I am crazy!

535
01:02:14,062 --> 01:02:15,129
No, not at all.

536
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:17,478
Oh. Okay.

537
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,677
All right, come on.

538
01:02:22,073 --> 01:02:26,585
I met a spiritual medium.

539
01:02:27,979 --> 01:02:31,027
They were performing
an open séance.

540
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:32,789
I know, I know
what you're thinking,

541
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,557
but they asked me to attend.

542
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:37,387
They were bringing skeptics
in and scientists.

543
01:02:37,426 --> 01:02:40,069
So I went, fully skeptical.

544
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:44,564
And what I experienced there,
Annie, was truly...

545
01:02:44,763 --> 01:02:45,508
Open séance...

546
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:51,478
They brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century.

547
01:02:51,549 --> 01:02:55,345
And no, no, not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way, no.

548
01:02:55,347 --> 01:02:56,550
And the man sitting next to me

549
01:02:56,552 --> 01:02:59,879
was a completely
cynical neurologist

550
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:04,224
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it.

551
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:07,417
No, I... I... I know
what you're thinking. I do.

552
01:03:07,471 --> 01:03:11,162
But I... I approached
the medium afterwards

553
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:13,980
and I asked her about my son
and my grandson

554
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:17,044
and she came to my apartment
and she...

555
01:03:22,585 --> 01:03:24,733
She ended up performing...

556
01:03:25,708 --> 01:03:30,071
Well... She conjured
my grandson.

557
01:03:31,048 --> 01:03:33,919
No, no, no, I know, I know
what that smile is. I know.

558
01:03:33,921 --> 01:03:36,392
Annie, Annie...
I wouldn't believe it either,

559
01:03:36,394 --> 01:03:38,006
I didn't believe it,

560
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,928
but I heard his voice.

561
01:03:42,651 --> 01:03:45,446
I felt his presence in the room.

562
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:47,907
Annie, this is real.

563
01:03:49,645 --> 01:03:51,420
What are you doing right now?

564
01:03:51,834 --> 01:03:53,485
I'm just here shopping.

565
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:54,895
Do you wanna come over?

566
01:03:55,098 --> 01:03:58,414
Oh, Annie. Please, Annie.
I really think you should.

567
01:03:58,489 --> 01:04:01,427
It would be everything
if you came.

568
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:15,688
Nice mood setter.

569
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,950
Okay.

570
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm going to put my hand
on the glass,

571
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,478
but I'm not going to
add pressure.

572
01:04:35,356 --> 01:04:36,958
You do the same.

573
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,240
All right.

574
01:04:52,494 --> 01:04:53,890
Louis...

575
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,418
Louis, are you here?
It's Grandma.

576
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,333
Louis, if you are here with us,

577
01:05:15,532 --> 01:05:19,002
please just try
and slide the glass.

578
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,294
Louis, if you're here...

579
01:05:30,223 --> 01:05:31,524
Hi, Louis!

580
01:05:31,582 --> 01:05:35,089
- Hi, Louis!
- How did you do that?

581
01:05:36,005 --> 01:05:40,399
Louis, I'm going to ask you
some questions. Okay, sweetie?

582
01:05:40,821 --> 01:05:45,152
If the answer is yes,
slide the glass to the right.

583
01:05:45,544 --> 01:05:47,144
If it's no,

584
01:05:47,286 --> 01:05:50,437
slide it the other way,
to the left.

585
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:52,244
Do you understand?

586
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:58,862
Louis, are you okay?

587
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:03,411
Are you in pain?

588
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:07,909
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. It's okay.

589
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:10,143
It's okay. It's okay.

590
01:06:10,206 --> 01:06:13,310
Louis, I brought
your chalkboard.

591
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,304
Remember your chalkboard?

592
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:19,246
Can you write something?

593
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:51,789
Oh, Louis!
I love you, sweetheart!

594
01:06:52,136 --> 01:06:54,239
I'm sorry. Could we stop?

595
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:55,685
What?

596
01:06:55,732 --> 01:06:57,838
- I'm sorry.
- Please...

597
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,371
Louis, we're going to stop
for a second,

598
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,301
but I'll be right back.

599
01:07:06,086 --> 01:07:06,812
Are you all right?

600
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,308
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I really...

601
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:09,881
I understand, I understand.

602
01:07:09,883 --> 01:07:11,911
That's exactly how I reacted
the first time.

603
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:13,409
I have to go. Okay.
I'm... I'm sorry. Thank you.

604
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:16,181
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
- Thank you. Yeah.

605
01:07:23,827 --> 01:07:26,527
I know. I know, honey.

606
01:07:26,604 --> 01:07:28,578
If you want to try this
on your own...

607
01:07:28,636 --> 01:07:31,205
- God...
- It's okay. It's okay.

608
01:07:31,254 --> 01:07:33,340
First light the candle,

609
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:36,168
then choose an item that
belonged to your daughter.

610
01:07:36,224 --> 01:07:39,027
That will be your link.
Mine was the chalkboard.

611
01:07:39,082 --> 01:07:40,449
That's my link.

612
01:07:40,632 --> 01:07:42,701
It's all right. It's all right.

613
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:45,469
It's okay. There you go.

614
01:07:45,471 --> 01:07:47,007
Then when you're ready,

615
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:49,335
read this out loud,

616
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:52,268
every syllable, very carefully.

617
01:07:52,545 --> 01:07:54,897
Sorry, why? What is it?

618
01:07:54,944 --> 01:07:56,424
I don't know
what language it is.

619
01:07:56,426 --> 01:07:58,614
The medium had me read it first.

620
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:00,656
It's to make things start.

621
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:03,259
But remember,
your whole family...

622
01:08:03,284 --> 01:08:05,996
Every member needs to be
in the house.

623
01:08:06,067 --> 01:08:08,821
Your son, everyone.
Very important.

624
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:10,546
- Okay.
- Okay?

625
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:13,102
Deep breath.

626
01:08:13,136 --> 01:08:14,891
You didn't kill her, Annie.

627
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:21,387
What?

628
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,947
She isn't gone.

629
01:11:10,114 --> 01:11:12,851
Mom? What are you doing?

630
01:11:17,944 --> 01:11:19,461
What's going on?

631
01:11:20,617 --> 01:11:22,284
You're sleepwalking.

632
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:32,920
I'm sorry. Is Charlie here?

633
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:37,652
Why are you scared of me?

634
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:42,843
What?

635
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:48,748
I never wanted
to be your mother.

636
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:54,718
Why?

637
01:11:55,299 --> 01:11:56,968
I was scared.

638
01:11:58,878 --> 01:12:02,047
I didn't feel like a mother.

639
01:12:02,822 --> 01:12:04,538
But she pressured me.

640
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:06,788
Then why did you have me?

641
01:12:06,837 --> 01:12:09,711
It wasn't my fault.
I tried to stop it.

642
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:13,063
How?

643
01:12:15,579 --> 01:12:17,604
I tried to have a miscarriage.

644
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,726
How?

645
01:12:22,894 --> 01:12:23,949
However I could.

646
01:12:23,951 --> 01:12:27,059
I did everything they told me
not to do but it didn't work.

647
01:12:27,579 --> 01:12:29,496
I'm happy it didn't work.

648
01:12:29,903 --> 01:12:31,750
You tried to kill me.

649
01:12:31,807 --> 01:12:33,604
No, I did not. I love you!

650
01:12:33,606 --> 01:12:34,814
You tried to kill me!

651
01:12:34,863 --> 01:12:36,667
- I love you!
- Why did you try to kill me?

652
01:12:36,737 --> 01:12:38,239
I didn't!
I was trying to save you!

653
01:12:38,295 --> 01:12:40,341
Why did you try to kill me?

654
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:08,300
Peter?

655
01:13:10,378 --> 01:13:11,942
Peter, sweetheart? Wake up.

656
01:13:11,944 --> 01:13:14,170
- What?
- It's okay. It's me.

657
01:13:14,217 --> 01:13:16,664
I am so, so sorry
for everything.

658
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:18,128
- Please, please forgive me.
- It's okay.

659
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:19,346
I can't stand the things I said.

660
01:13:19,348 --> 01:13:20,817
It's okay. It's okay.

661
01:13:22,425 --> 01:13:24,777
Can you get up, sweetheart?
We're gonna try something.

662
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:26,291
I was having a nightmare.

663
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,792
Oh, it's okay.
We can do something.

664
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:28,657
Do what?

665
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,696
I figured it out.
Come on, come on.

666
01:13:32,957 --> 01:13:36,169
Steven. Baby. Steve, wake up.

667
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:38,678
- What?
- Come downstairs.

668
01:13:38,742 --> 01:13:39,978
We're gonna try
something together.

669
01:13:40,002 --> 01:13:42,152
Come on, come on.

670
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:46,106
Steve, come on. Let's go.

671
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,487
- Dad?
- It's okay.

672
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:11,898
Come on, come on!

673
01:14:18,376 --> 01:14:21,043
Okay. So...

674
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,163
It's freezing in here.

675
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,872
Wait! No, no, no.
What are you doing? Wait!

676
01:14:24,917 --> 01:14:25,894
I'm gonna close the window.

677
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,342
No, no.
We can't change anything.

678
01:14:27,344 --> 01:14:28,844
I don't wanna mess it up.

679
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:31,257
Everyone needs to sit. Come sit.

680
01:14:32,089 --> 01:14:33,643
My friend Joan taught me
how to do this.

681
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:36,303
What friend Joan?

682
01:14:36,547 --> 01:14:37,869
We need our palms on the table

683
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:39,558
and our fingers to touch.
Please.

684
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,000
What are we doing here, Annie?

685
01:14:41,045 --> 01:14:42,480
Please. You'll see.

686
01:14:44,457 --> 01:14:47,619
Please. Trust me.

687
01:14:51,046 --> 01:14:52,471
All right, fine.

688
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,310
We can do it over here then.

689
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:01,241
Peter. Okay.

690
01:15:02,451 --> 01:15:04,885
Okay, Steve. Come on.

691
01:15:05,814 --> 01:15:07,660
I need you both to concentrate.

692
01:15:07,662 --> 01:15:08,553
On what?

693
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:09,540
Think about Charlie, if you can.

694
01:15:09,542 --> 01:15:11,975
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Sweetheart, please, please.

695
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:13,046
I tried this 20 minutes ago

696
01:15:13,048 --> 01:15:14,449
- and it worked.
- What worked?

697
01:15:14,451 --> 01:15:15,427
I would not be bringing you
down here if it didn't.

698
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:16,288
Well, I just need to show you.

699
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:19,973
- Show what?
- Fuck! I'm a...

700
01:15:20,404 --> 01:15:21,577
I'm a medium, okay?

701
01:15:21,579 --> 01:15:22,958
I was seeing apparitions earlier

702
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,198
and I just shook them off
and I shouldn't have.

703
01:15:25,486 --> 01:15:26,575
Please, I know how it sounds,

704
01:15:26,599 --> 01:15:27,621
but there's no way
to talk about it.

705
01:15:27,645 --> 01:15:29,836
I just need to show you, okay?
Please, you'll see.

706
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:31,747
- I'm completely lucid.
- Peter, go to bed.

707
01:15:31,801 --> 01:15:33,528
What! No, no, no! Peter, please!

708
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:34,529
We need to do this as a family.

709
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:37,329
This needs all our energies,
okay? Together.

710
01:15:37,365 --> 01:15:39,803
All right, I'll stay.

711
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:41,636
Steve. Steve, please.

712
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:43,967
I really, really need you
to be open to this.

713
01:15:43,969 --> 01:15:47,034
Please, please.
I promise... Both of you.

714
01:15:47,102 --> 01:15:49,992
Please. I need you
to be open. Please.

715
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:53,851
Come on, Steve.
Come on, come on. I promise.

716
01:15:53,853 --> 01:15:56,947
Okay.

717
01:15:57,499 --> 01:15:59,091
Okay, good.

718
01:15:59,426 --> 01:16:01,464
So, I read that earlier.

719
01:16:01,466 --> 01:16:03,301
I don't think
I need to read that again.

720
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,970
What language is even that?

721
01:16:06,369 --> 01:16:08,819
Try to concentrate.

722
01:16:15,647 --> 01:16:16,770
Charlie?

723
01:16:18,306 --> 01:16:19,915
Charlie, are you here?

724
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,566
Charlie, it's Mommy.

725
01:16:30,621 --> 01:16:32,175
And Daddy and Peter.

726
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:41,937
Charlie, if you're
in this room with us,

727
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:44,050
I'm gonna have us all
touch the glass.

728
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:45,486
Don't add pressure.

729
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:48,170
Now if you're in here, Charlie,

730
01:16:48,256 --> 01:16:50,546
I want you to move
the glass for us.

731
01:16:50,615 --> 01:16:51,799
Even if it's just a tiny bit.

732
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:52,906
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie!
- Even if it's just the tiniest

733
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,544
little movement. Okay, Charlie?

734
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,908
Okay.

735
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:02,851
Shit. What the hell?

736
01:17:03,725 --> 01:17:05,694
- What?
- You don't feel that?

737
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:07,188
What? Feel what?

738
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:11,083
Like, you don't feel
the air flexing?

739
01:17:14,522 --> 01:17:16,589
Wow! Yes!

740
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:18,961
Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!

741
01:17:19,225 --> 01:17:22,535
Okay. Now, Charlie,
what I'd like for you to do

742
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:25,502
is I'd like for you to show
them what you did earlier.

743
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,399
Can you show them what
you just did for me before?

744
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:33,523
- Mom.
- She's gonna do it.

745
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,326
- That's enough!
- What! No, no, no!

746
01:17:40,328 --> 01:17:42,659
Listen, when I did this earlier,

747
01:17:43,038 --> 01:17:45,747
this manifested on the page.
I saw it!

748
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:47,197
- I saw it!
- What is it?

749
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,651
- It's Charlie!
- Annie!

750
01:17:48,653 --> 01:17:49,812
Charlie, did you want to draw
some more?

751
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:51,882
- You can keep going.
- Stop it! Stop it!

752
01:17:51,913 --> 01:17:54,130
Okay, we need to keep
our fingers touching...

753
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,853
You are scaring him!

754
01:17:55,855 --> 01:17:58,351
No, I am not!
Peter, Peter, listen...

755
01:17:58,353 --> 01:17:59,474
Stop it!

756
01:17:59,476 --> 01:18:01,964
Listen to me.
There is no need to be scared.

757
01:18:01,966 --> 01:18:03,137
This is your sister.

758
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:05,418
Mom.

759
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,012
Charlie, what's wrong?

760
01:18:51,337 --> 01:18:52,337
Hello?

761
01:18:53,307 --> 01:18:56,703
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?

762
01:18:56,705 --> 01:18:57,788
I don't like this.

763
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:59,416
- Dad, I don't like this.
- What's happening?

764
01:18:59,418 --> 01:19:00,791
- Please stop.
- Annie, please, stop this.

765
01:19:00,793 --> 01:19:01,850
- What's going on?
- Please stop this.

766
01:19:01,852 --> 01:19:03,260
- Please.
- Mom!

767
01:19:03,262 --> 01:19:04,816
You're really freaking me out.
Please stop.

768
01:19:04,818 --> 01:19:05,987
What's happening?
Why is everyone scared?

769
01:19:05,989 --> 01:19:07,230
Dad, make it stop.

770
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,135
Why are you scaring me!

771
01:19:09,184 --> 01:19:11,389
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Make it fucking stop!

772
01:19:11,436 --> 01:19:13,477
- Make it stop!
- Where's Mom!

773
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:16,522
Stop it!
Stop it now! Please stop!

774
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:18,569
Mom? Peter? Peter, I'm scared.

775
01:19:18,618 --> 01:19:20,581
Dad, make it stop!

776
01:19:20,669 --> 01:19:24,431
What the hell?
What are you doing?

777
01:19:33,297 --> 01:19:34,766
What happened?

778
01:20:19,098 --> 01:20:21,605
Our country has had
many ups and downs

779
01:20:21,607 --> 01:20:22,920
economically speaking.

780
01:20:22,922 --> 01:20:24,388
We've talked about the struggles

781
01:20:24,426 --> 01:20:29,281
during the 1800s
compared to the fall of 1929,

782
01:20:29,544 --> 01:20:32,141
in an era that
become known appropriately

783
01:20:32,196 --> 01:20:33,845
as the Great Depression.

784
01:20:33,847 --> 01:20:37,902
For a decade we suffered
through many, many hardships.

785
01:20:37,950 --> 01:20:42,824
In 1929, Wall Street had been
going so well

786
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:46,849
that when it finally crashed
because of the Great Boom,

787
01:20:46,912 --> 01:20:51,482
it caused a huge decline
in the economy.

788
01:20:51,588 --> 01:20:55,219
So much so
that it caused food lines.

789
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:01,371
This is where
the Federal Government has,

790
01:21:01,373 --> 01:21:02,771
or still has...

791
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:15,695
Uh, uh. Yes, Peter?

792
01:21:15,697 --> 01:21:18,229
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

793
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,879
Um, of course. Take the pass.

794
01:21:24,444 --> 01:21:25,768
As I was saying...

795
01:21:31,405 --> 01:21:32,405
Hello?

796
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,376
<i>Can you guess
who just called me from school</i>

797
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,395
<i>in complete hysterics?</i>

798
01:21:37,362 --> 01:21:39,898
- Charlie?
- <i>What?</i>

799
01:21:41,309 --> 01:21:43,564
Uh, nothing. What happened?

800
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,062
<i>Peter just called me, Annie,</i>

801
01:21:45,064 --> 01:21:47,173
<i>terrified, crying in the halls,</i>

802
01:21:47,175 --> 01:21:48,279
<i>convinced he's being threatened</i>

803
01:21:48,281 --> 01:21:50,744
<i>by some vengeful spirit.</i>

804
01:21:50,799 --> 01:21:52,822
Why does he think
he's being threatened?

805
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,867
<i>Listen to me, Annie.
I have a son to protect.</i>

806
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:57,046
What does that mean?

807
01:21:57,048 --> 01:21:59,351
<i>It means that that's what
I'm worried about right now</i>

808
01:21:59,389 --> 01:22:00,268
<i>and that's how...</i>

809
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:01,704
Hey, don't talk to me like this.

810
01:22:01,739 --> 01:22:03,260
He's my son too...

811
01:22:03,596 --> 01:22:04,596
Oh!

812
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:17,815
Do not hang up on me again.

813
01:22:17,817 --> 01:22:21,149
I am not sleepwalking anymore.
Do you understand?

814
01:22:46,312 --> 01:22:47,333
<i>At the tone,</i>

815
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:49,468
<i>please record
your voice message.</i>

816
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,941
<i>When you are finished recording,</i>

817
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:53,993
<i>you may hang up or press pound
for more options.</i>

818
01:22:53,995 --> 01:22:55,846
<i>Annie, hi!</i>

819
01:22:55,848 --> 01:22:58,097
<i>This is Patrick
at the Archer Gallery.</i>

820
01:22:58,099 --> 01:23:01,552
<i>Um, I was just calling
first to see how you're doing,</i>

821
01:23:01,554 --> 01:23:03,233
<i>how your family's doing.</i>

822
01:23:03,235 --> 01:23:04,527
<i>We've all been thinking
about you</i>

823
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:06,786
<i>and just worrying about you</i>

824
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:08,883
<i>and hoping you're okay.</i>

825
01:23:08,885 --> 01:23:11,449
<i>You guys have been in our
constant thoughts and prayers.</i>

826
01:23:11,451 --> 01:23:16,743
<i>And then also, uh, we just
wanted to, well, to say first,</i>

827
01:23:16,745 --> 01:23:19,497
<i>if you need us to postpone
the show or push the date,</i>

828
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:21,385
<i>it's obviously more than okay.</i>

829
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:25,551
<i>And if not, uh,
we just wanna call and see</i>

830
01:23:25,595 --> 01:23:28,859
<i>if we could help
in any way or offer...</i>

831
01:23:40,918 --> 01:23:43,532
Oh, jeez. That smell.

832
01:23:53,025 --> 01:23:55,153
Annie? What's that smell?

833
01:24:20,626 --> 01:24:22,168
What the fuck happened here?

834
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,489
I didn't feel like
looking at it anymore.

835
01:27:14,172 --> 01:27:15,340
Charlie?

836
01:27:55,469 --> 01:27:58,024
Peter? Oh my God, Peter!

837
01:27:59,117 --> 01:28:00,539
What's wrong, baby?
What's happening?

838
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,586
What are you doing?

839
01:28:01,588 --> 01:28:02,602
What do you mean?

840
01:28:02,604 --> 01:28:04,270
You were pulling on my head!

841
01:28:04,272 --> 01:28:05,422
What? No I wasn't.
I just came in.

842
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,721
You were screaming.
What happened?

843
01:28:07,791 --> 01:28:09,036
I saw Charlie in the corner

844
01:28:09,038 --> 01:28:11,014
and then you started
trying to pull my head off!

845
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:12,978
Oh, Peter.
I would never do that to you.

846
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,798
Are you crazy? Please, baby.

847
01:28:16,194 --> 01:28:17,763
What corner did you see Charlie?

848
01:28:19,476 --> 01:28:20,831
Peter, listen to me.

849
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:23,017
I don't know what's happening
or what you just saw,

850
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:24,721
but I am stopping this.

851
01:28:24,783 --> 01:28:26,804
Do not tell Dad
what you just said to me.

852
01:28:26,837 --> 01:28:28,922
Do not, okay?
Because it is not true.

853
01:28:28,924 --> 01:28:29,810
Something is happening

854
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:30,880
and I'm the only one
who could stop it.

855
01:28:30,882 --> 01:28:32,868
Do you understand?
I'm the only one

856
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:34,192
who can fix this.

857
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:17,156
Joan?

858
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:24,029
Joan, please.
I need to talk to you.

859
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:30,452
Joan, I really need
to ask you a question.

860
01:31:37,847 --> 01:31:39,049
Joan!

861
01:32:01,788 --> 01:32:03,306
Peter!

862
01:32:08,825 --> 01:32:10,070
Peter!

863
01:32:12,599 --> 01:32:14,554
Peter!

864
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:20,658
I expel you!

865
01:32:24,459 --> 01:32:26,294
Zantany!

866
01:32:31,064 --> 01:32:32,497
Dagdany!

867
01:32:34,945 --> 01:32:36,754
Aparagon!

868
01:32:39,223 --> 01:32:40,999
Peter!

869
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:44,424
Get out!

870
01:32:48,722 --> 01:32:50,208
Peter!

871
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:21,515
Oh, God.

872
01:36:50,565 --> 01:36:53,535
So everyone feels justified.

873
01:36:55,178 --> 01:36:58,820
Iphigenia's murder
was commanded by the gods.

874
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:32,115
So, really,
Agamemnon had no choice...

875
01:38:00,836 --> 01:38:02,170
Peter.

876
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:05,897
Peter, what's wrong?

877
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:10,484
Peter, are you all right?

878
01:38:15,993 --> 01:38:18,469
Can he breathe?

879
01:38:18,593 --> 01:38:20,045
Peter, what are you doing, man?

880
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:04,316
<i>Call from West High School.</i>

881
01:39:24,522 --> 01:39:25,757
Hello.

882
01:39:26,887 --> 01:39:28,051
Yes, it is.

883
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,052
Oh, thank God.

884
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,758
Wait, what? Oh my God!

885
01:40:12,813 --> 01:40:15,481
What happened?
What happened to him?

886
01:40:15,544 --> 01:40:17,614
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

887
01:40:17,647 --> 01:40:21,342
Oh my God. Oh, no.
Oh, who did that?

888
01:40:21,408 --> 01:40:23,823
He did it, apparently,
to himself.

889
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:27,049
Smashed his face
into his own desk.

890
01:40:27,051 --> 01:40:29,709
Okay, Steve. Wait, wait.
Wait, Steve. Listen.

891
01:40:29,711 --> 01:40:32,289
Take his feet.
Please, take his feet.

892
01:40:37,841 --> 01:40:41,002
Steve, uh, upstairs...

893
01:40:41,064 --> 01:40:45,179
In the attic when you were
gone, I went up there and I...

894
01:40:45,226 --> 01:40:46,183
I just... I really need you

895
01:40:46,185 --> 01:40:48,020
to go up there
and see what I saw.

896
01:40:49,108 --> 01:40:50,683
There's a body.

897
01:40:51,705 --> 01:40:52,994
Yeah. I mean,
I think it's my mother,

898
01:40:52,996 --> 01:40:54,833
I think, but I can't tell
because the skin's all black

899
01:40:54,835 --> 01:40:57,370
and she's all distended
but the head is gone.

900
01:40:58,799 --> 01:41:01,769
Will you, please? I just need
you to go and see upstairs.

901
01:41:03,527 --> 01:41:06,177
Please, Steve.

902
01:41:17,804 --> 01:41:19,239
And then there's more.

903
01:41:19,891 --> 01:41:22,654
You mean more than your
mother's headless body?

904
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:24,178
Of course there is.

905
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:14,179
- Jesus, fuck!
- Okay, there's more.

906
01:42:14,181 --> 01:42:15,921
What the fuck was that?

907
01:42:15,923 --> 01:42:17,266
Why didn't you call the police?

908
01:42:17,268 --> 01:42:18,911
The police can't help us.

909
01:42:19,497 --> 01:42:20,335
Who the fuck is that up there?

910
01:42:20,337 --> 01:42:22,571
Do you remember Joan,
my friend whose grandson died?

911
01:42:22,573 --> 01:42:25,084
- She took me to her apartment.
- It did look like your mother.

912
01:42:25,143 --> 01:42:26,779
Well, listen. She taught me
how to do the séance.

913
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:29,272
I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back

914
01:42:29,274 --> 01:42:31,517
and I saw it and felt it just
like you did with Charlie.

915
01:42:31,519 --> 01:42:33,923
Now, look.
This is my mother's album.

916
01:42:33,925 --> 01:42:35,586
Now look here. See this?

917
01:42:35,588 --> 01:42:38,106
See her?
That's her. That's Joan.

918
01:42:38,108 --> 01:42:39,461
She didn't even mention
knowing my mom

919
01:42:39,463 --> 01:42:41,224
and I've never met her before,
but she approached me.

920
01:42:41,226 --> 01:42:42,513
She consoled me.

921
01:42:42,515 --> 01:42:44,722
She told me about this séance,
and she showed me how.

922
01:42:44,724 --> 01:42:45,867
Now look at this.
See this symbol?

923
01:42:45,891 --> 01:42:46,833
On the necklace my mom gave me.

924
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:48,714
It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,

925
01:42:48,716 --> 01:42:50,864
and they're wearing it
in every photo.

926
01:42:50,866 --> 01:42:52,961
And look at that pattern!
Did you see up there?

927
01:42:52,963 --> 01:42:55,522
This was painted
above the body, right?

928
01:42:55,524 --> 01:42:57,006
In blood!

929
01:42:58,126 --> 01:43:02,066
You dug up the grave.
It was you, wasn't it?

930
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,822
What?

931
01:43:02,824 --> 01:43:03,723
All those nights you were

932
01:43:03,725 --> 01:43:05,024
pretending to go to the movies.

933
01:43:05,026 --> 01:43:06,066
You're not even listening!

934
01:43:06,068 --> 01:43:07,811
And then the day
the cemetery called, I said,

935
01:43:07,813 --> 01:43:10,023
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."

936
01:43:10,025 --> 01:43:12,331
Oh, God damn it!
Listen to me, Steve!

937
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:13,850
I know you don't trust me

938
01:43:13,852 --> 01:43:15,745
and there is nothing
I can do about that.

939
01:43:16,512 --> 01:43:19,017
But they put a curse on us
when we brought Charlie back.

940
01:43:19,019 --> 01:43:21,003
We made a pact with something.

941
01:43:21,005 --> 01:43:21,921
Something that is in this house.

942
01:43:21,952 --> 01:43:23,753
I don't know what it is
but it is after Peter.

943
01:43:23,755 --> 01:43:26,668
I watched these pages fill.

944
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:29,228
All of them are Peter!

945
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:31,655
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.

946
01:43:31,657 --> 01:43:34,702
I don't know what I did
but Peter is in danger...

947
01:43:35,166 --> 01:43:37,136
And I started it.

948
01:43:37,667 --> 01:43:39,776
Now if we destroy this book,

949
01:43:40,275 --> 01:43:42,089
it will take me too.

950
01:43:43,145 --> 01:43:44,619
I tried to burn it. I tried.

951
01:43:44,621 --> 01:43:46,487
But my arm caught on fire
on its own

952
01:43:46,489 --> 01:43:48,051
as if I was linked to it
because I am linked to it.

953
01:43:48,053 --> 01:43:50,623
I understand this now. Please!

954
01:43:51,103 --> 01:43:53,106
If we don't destroy this book...

955
01:43:56,168 --> 01:43:57,872
Peter will...

956
01:43:59,325 --> 01:44:02,074
Oh, God. Do you understand?

957
01:44:03,326 --> 01:44:07,630
We have to do this. Please,
please, please, please.

958
01:44:07,707 --> 01:44:09,175
For Peter.

959
01:44:20,438 --> 01:44:22,507
I need you to trust me, Steve.

960
01:44:24,243 --> 01:44:27,187
It needs to be me.
It's my fault.

961
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:30,808
It's my fault.
I know it's my fault. Please.

962
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:33,914
Please, I need you
to throw it in the fire.

963
01:44:35,116 --> 01:44:36,455
Please, I just... I can't do it.

964
01:44:36,457 --> 01:44:38,918
I can't.
I'm just too fucking scared.

965
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,795
But if we don't do it...

966
01:44:40,797 --> 01:44:43,367
If we don't do it,
it's gonna be Peter,

967
01:44:43,423 --> 01:44:46,771
it's gonna be our son.
Okay, I know this. I know so.

968
01:44:46,773 --> 01:44:49,797
Just, please, please,
please, please, please...

969
01:44:54,802 --> 01:44:57,344
Steve, please.
Please understand, baby.

970
01:44:57,346 --> 01:45:01,896
Please, please.
Please throw it in the fire.

971
01:45:10,177 --> 01:45:12,226
Sweetheart, please.

972
01:45:12,493 --> 01:45:14,830
Please take it, take it.
You gotta do it.

973
01:45:14,832 --> 01:45:15,939
You gotta do it.

974
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:18,229
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

975
01:45:18,299 --> 01:45:22,394
Okay, here. Okay.

976
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,376
Now listen to me. Listen to me.

977
01:45:31,707 --> 01:45:35,927
Oh! You are the love of my life.

978
01:45:41,017 --> 01:45:44,638
I love you, Steve.
I love you so, so much.

979
01:45:45,496 --> 01:45:48,013
Oh, God, I love you so much.

980
01:45:48,140 --> 01:45:49,954
And I love Peter so much.

981
01:45:54,243 --> 01:45:55,697
Now please, just...

982
01:45:57,228 --> 01:45:59,030
Please just throw it in.

983
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:19,280
I'm not gonna do this
with you anymore.

984
01:46:20,036 --> 01:46:22,087
What? No, no, no!

985
01:46:22,143 --> 01:46:24,412
No, no,
it's not helpful for you.

986
01:46:25,126 --> 01:46:27,664
You are sick, Annie.

987
01:46:28,462 --> 01:46:30,184
I need to call the police.

988
01:46:31,196 --> 01:46:33,031
Oh, God!

989
01:47:40,185 --> 01:47:41,253
Mom?

990
01:47:45,052 --> 01:47:46,119
Dad?

991
01:49:23,218 --> 01:49:24,351
Mom?

992
01:49:25,501 --> 01:49:26,501
Dad?

993
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:54,053
Hello?

994
01:50:41,858 --> 01:50:43,492
Mom?

995
01:53:22,779 --> 01:53:25,363
Stop! Mom, please stop!

996
01:53:25,365 --> 01:53:27,618
Mom, I'm sorry! Okay, I'm sorry.

997
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:35,159
Mommy. Mommy, please.
I'm begging you.

998
01:53:35,175 --> 01:53:36,876
I'm begging you to stop.

999
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:46,223
Mommy?

1000
01:55:03,216 --> 01:55:05,023
Just gotta wake up.

1001
01:55:05,025 --> 01:55:07,348
You just gotta wake up.
Come on. You're okay.

1002
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:10,531
Just wake up. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1003
02:01:27,271 --> 02:01:31,590
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's all right.

1004
02:01:32,131 --> 02:01:33,487
Charlie...

1005
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,896
You're all right now.

1006
02:01:41,770 --> 02:01:45,786
You are Paimon,

1007
02:01:46,831 --> 02:01:49,736
one of the eight kings of Hell.

1008
02:01:52,502 --> 02:01:55,340
We have looked to the Northwest

1009
02:01:55,342 --> 02:01:57,253
and called you in.

1010
02:01:58,152 --> 02:02:01,213
We've corrected
your first female body

1011
02:02:01,582 --> 02:02:06,119
and give you now
this healthy male host.

1012
02:02:06,823 --> 02:02:12,426
We reject the Trinity and pray
devoutly to you, great Paimon.

1013
02:02:12,848 --> 02:02:17,111
Give us your knowledge
of all secret things.

1014
02:02:17,486 --> 02:02:22,140
Bring us honor, wealth,
and good familiars.

1015
02:02:22,734 --> 02:02:25,722
Bind all men to our will,

1016
02:02:25,808 --> 02:02:31,810
as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to yours.

1017
02:02:38,966 --> 02:02:40,702
Hail, Paimon!

1018
02:02:41,455 --> 02:02:43,918
Hail, Paimon!

1019
02:02:45,012 --> 02:02:47,517
Hail, Paimon!

1020
02:02:48,647 --> 02:02:50,848
Hail!
