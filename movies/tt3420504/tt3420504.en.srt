<i>I can't remember if I cried</i>

4
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,642
<i>When I read about his widowed bride</i>

5
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>And something touched me deep inside</i>

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,483
<i>The day the music...</i>

7
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,157
<i>UV radiation high.</i>

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,452
<i>Temperature, 150 degrees. Caution.</i>

<i>Body temperature high, 101.2.</i>

00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,502
Okay. Okay.

Dewey.

12
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,848
<i>So
Bye, bye, bye Miss American Pie</i>

13
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>Drove my Chevy to the levee</i>

14
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,854
<i>But the levee was dry</i>

15
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,693
<i>And them good ole boys
Were drinking whiskey and rye</i>

16
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,489
<i>Singin' this'll be the day that I die</i>

17
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,577
<i>This'll be the day that I die</i>

18
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,042
Dewey, bottle.

19
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above</i>

20
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,766
<i>If the Bible tells you so?</i>

21
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:08,814
<i>Hey, do you believe in rock and roll?</i>

22
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,233
<i>Can music--</i>

23
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,320
<i>Save your mortal soul?</i>

24
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,782
<i>And can you teach me to dance...</i>

25
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,916
Okay.

26
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,210
Someone's going to be happy tonight.

27
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,059
Jesus.

28
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,229
Getting old.

29
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>I was a lonely teenage bronckin' buck</i>

<i>With a pink carnation
And a pickup truck</i>

All right. Front's up.

33
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,548
Done.

34
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,176
Okay.

35
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,637
<i>So I was singing</i>

36
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,124
Sorry.

37
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,626
Sorry.

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,981
In!

68
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,881
Okay. Your turn.

69
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,426
Get the eyeballs.

70
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,761
Up with the paw.

71
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,598
Eyes up.

72
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,141
Up. Come on.

73
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,265
All right. See you downstairs.

74
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:03,210
Hey. I didn't forget about you.

75
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,713
What? Did you miss me? Yes, I missed you.

76
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,634
Yes, I think about you all the time.
Yes, I do. Yeah.

77
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,179
Yeah. Yeah.

78
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:19,726
Yes, I'll give you scratches.
That's all I'm here for, right?

79
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,145
Just to scratch you.

80
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,482
Just to scratch you.

81
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,996
Now can we please have
a quiet evening at home tonight?

82
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,625
Hey, cut it out.

83
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,007
Good boy, Dewey.

84
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,632
Okay, okay. Don't worry about me.
Carry on.

85
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,878
Thanks, Dewey.

86
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,783
Oh, hi.

87
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,415
Where's your ball? Is it here?
Is it here? Where's your ball?

88
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,043
Go! Oh! Get it!

89
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,640
All right, you're next.

90
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,059
Come here, dog breath. Come on.

91
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:16,607
Okay.

92
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,942
Now I'm gonna need your eyes.

93
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:21,486
I'm sorry, Dewey.

94
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:24,531
I'll get you new ones. I promise.

95
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,699
And it'll be worth it.

96
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,431
One small step for man...

97
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:55,187
one giant leap for Finch Weinberg.

98
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,089
Hello.

99
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,844
If you can speak, say "yes."

102
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:36,854
Okay.

103
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,856
Hey.

104
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,109
How about nodding your head?

105
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,489
If you can understand me, nod your head.

106
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,582
No, I don't know why he's not working.

107
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,177
You do-- You do understand?
Do you understand?

108
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,560
Only nod if I ask you a question
that you understand.

109
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,644
Do you understand?

110
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,690
Stop nodding.

111
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:29,948
You understand.

112
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,746
Stop nodding your head.

113
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,961
You have a friend! Good boy.

114
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,425
Yeah.

115
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,722
Okay, I've done some tweaking.

116
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,895
Not exactly what I had in mind.

117
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,439
It should do for now.

118
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,363
Now, if you can speak, say something.

119
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,290
Calm down.

120
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,627
Something.

121
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,550
Something. Something, indeed.

122
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,427
Indeed.

123
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,100
So...

124
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,270
Tell me something interesting.

125
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:47,985
Giraffes can survive without water
longer than camels.

126
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,278
Is that a fact?

127
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,905
I bet you didn't know that.

128
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,536
Kangaroo rats can survive
longer than giraffes.

129
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,830
-Okay. Okay, okay.
-Did you know--

130
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,709
Tell me something interesting about you.

131
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,714
I have four primary directives.

132
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,424
What is the first directive?

133
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:15,721
First directive:
A robot cannot harm a human

134
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,516
or, through inaction,
allow a human to be harmed.

135
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:21,852
Hey, calm down.

136
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,688
Calm down-- All right, listen to this.

137
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,690
It'll make you feel better.

138
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,736
What about the fourth directive?

139
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,071
Fourth directive:

140
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:39,161
In Finch's absence,
robot must protect the welfare of dog.

141
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:43,415
This directive supersedes
all other directives.

142
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,833
You hear that?

143
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,837
So, you understand
how important this dog is to me?

144
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,048
Yes.

145
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,885
So, you know who Finch is?

146
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,971
You are Finch.

147
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,016
Yes.

148
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,815
Now... define absence.

149
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,820
The state of not being present.

150
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,073
Finch...

151
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,492
Yes?

152
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:23,747
When will you be absent?

153
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,965
Oh, shit.

154
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,423
Oh, sheet.

155
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,305
Hello, dog.

156
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:26,768
I know 16,000 interesting facts about--

157
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,561
Hello, Finch.

158
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,398
I'm connecting you
to a local weather station.

159
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,691
Tell me when you see it.

160
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:16,818
Connected.

161
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,404
I need you to use this data
to make a forecast.

162
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:23,033
Data indicates 15 separate weather events

163
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,246
advancing at 155 miles per hour.

164
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,457
Current data predicts
these events will intersect

165
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,211
over this location
within the next 24 hours.

166
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,462
How long will it last?

167
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:42,302
Probability these combined events
will create a superstorm is 1.00452--

168
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,848
No. No, I need to know
how long it will last.

169
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,435
Forty days, approximately.

170
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,557
So we need to get
the hell out of St. Louis.

171
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,726
South is out of the question.

172
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,021
Not with the storm season we've had.

173
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,190
As is north, obviously.

174
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,986
And east, too many cities.

175
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,030
You know what that means?

176
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,490
People.

177
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,701
Pass.

178
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,331
So that's that, then.

179
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,250
Head west.

180
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,503
Over the mountains.

181
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,756
Go easy on the rations.

182
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,093
A little bit of luck.

183
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,388
Find places
that haven't been ransacked or looted.

184
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,103
San Francisco.

185
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:17,940
What do you think?

186
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,025
Yeah, I think it's time.

187
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,215
What are you doing, Finch?

188
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,718
I'm increasing your transfer rate.

189
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,472
It's not what I want,
but we're out of time.

190
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,474
Can you simplify?

191
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,021
If we don't go before that storm hits,
we'll die down here. All of us.

192
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,314
Do you understand?

193
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:00,899
Yes.

194
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,068
So, as soon as you can walk,
we're leaving.

195
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,486
But, Finch...

196
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:10,117
if we leave now,
data transfer would only be at 72%.

197
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,786
Well, we can't all be Einstein.

198
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,833
Did you know Albert Einstein
was born with an abnormally large head?

199
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,388
I gave you digital levelers.

200
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:37,936
And redundant gyros, so...
it's not your balance.

201
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,732
It's your rhythm.

202
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,948
Watch me and imitate. Walking in place.

203
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:56,455
One, two. One, two. One, two.

204
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:01,710
One, two. One, two. One, two.

205
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:05,255
-Good. Good. Stop. Stop.
-One, two. One, two.

206
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:11,345
All right. All right.
Now, this is walking forward...

207
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,767
One, two. One, two. One, two.

208
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,562
Turning... and one, two.

209
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,524
One, two. One, two.

210
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,152
Understood?

211
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,530
Okay.

212
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,325
All right.

213
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,872
And imitate. Forward.

214
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,962
One, two.

215
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,761
Walking.

216
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,138
Yeah. Good.

217
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,223
And stop.

218
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:57,850
Turning.

219
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:58,976
Turning.

220
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,400
Stop.

221
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:08,569
Stopping.

222
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,446
That's good. Good.

223
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,909
No, here. Hey.

224
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:18,412
Look.

225
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,706
Walk to me.

226
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,799
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.

227
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,342
One, Finch.

228
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,263
-One, two.
-Now, that's falling.

229
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,347
One, two.

230
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,820
One, two.

231
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,323
One, two. One.

232
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,918
I am walking.

233
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,256
Dewey?

234
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,721
Dewey.

235
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,808
Dewey.

236
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,015
I am okay.

237
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,729
Sorry.

238
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,906
This is a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind.

239
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,951
<i>UV radiation high. Caution.</i>

240
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,536
Hello, dog.

241
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,372
<i>Temperature, 147 degrees.</i>

242
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:31,503
I know 3,027 interesting facts
about this vehicle.

243
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,340
Would you like me to drive?

244
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,384
No, you just learned how to walk.

245
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,180
Wait, wait. Let me sit down.

246
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:33,524
Did you know the population of St. Louis
is over 600,000?

247
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,567
Where is everybody?

248
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,819
It's a long story.

249
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,698
Yeah, we should be safe
once we get into the mountains.

250
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:45,202
Finch, what is our destination?

251
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:59,341
When I was a kid, these fields
were covered with wildflowers.

252
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:04,721
Mustard seed, alfalfa.
Color as far as the eye could see.

253
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,433
And in summertime, there were bees.

254
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,645
You would've loved it.

255
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:17,526
Finch, there is something
hanging out the back of my head.

256
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,195
I know. Don't fiddle with it.

257
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,572
Sorry.

258
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,407
And stop apologizing.

259
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,783
Sorry.

260
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,744
As soon as it's safe to stop,
I'll take a look.

261
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:30,664
Woof, woof.

262
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,845
<i>UV radiation high. 165 degrees.</i>

263
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:45,929
<i>Caution.</i>

264
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,433
-Hold still.
-Sorry.

265
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,521
Are these all photographs
of places you have been?

266
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:56,857
Those are postcards.

267
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,943
For the record, it's rude to rifle
through a man's personal effects.

268
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,029
Postcards.

269
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,285
Like a card sent in the post?

270
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,371
Yes. Yes, people actually used to do that.

271
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,459
Before this thing they call the Internet.

272
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,085
Why?

273
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,673
So friends and family could stay in touch.

274
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,886
Who sent that one?

275
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,724
-Oops.
-What was that?

276
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,143
Nothing. Nothing. Just stop fidgeting.

277
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,228
Sorry.

278
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,648
Who sent you that one?

279
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,819
An uncle in San Francisco.

280
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,197
And this one?

281
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,242
Well, that's the Tower Bridge in London.

282
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,661
And that's
the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

283
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,538
And that's Sydney Harbour Bridge.

284
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:54,581
Sydney Harbour?

285
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,335
I would like to see this bridge very much.

286
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,839
Maybe we should
make this our destination, Finch.

287
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,632
Well, Sydney's pretty far away.

288
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,678
Why not something a little closer,
like San Francisco?

289
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,012
How far away is that?

290
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:13,350
1,811 miles exactly.

291
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,024
Maybe we'll see it together.

292
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,527
There. All done.

293
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,696
Good as new.

294
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:29,283
Well, we have got to
get this show on the road.

295
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,701
You have a lot to learn.

296
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:35,372
No, Dewey.
Let's let the big fella have a turn.

297
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,794
Watch me then imitate.

298
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:42,212
Now, lesson number one...

299
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,630
Lesson number one.

300
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,967
Never pass on the opportunity
for your next meal.

301
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,094
Especially when you have
a hungry dog to feed.

302
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,805
Especially when you have
a hungry dog to feed.

303
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:53,599
Like that theater there.

304
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,852
You see, the padlocks on the doors
are still intact.

305
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,270
They are still intact.

306
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,939
That means whatever was inside
is still inside.

307
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,608
<i>UV radiation high.</i>

308
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,193
-And lesson number two...
<i>-Caution.</i>

309
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:07,821
Up there, there are holes in the sky.
It's like Swiss cheese.

310
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:13,452
-Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.
-Took me awhile to figure that out.

311
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,996
When the flare hit,
it completely fried the ozone,

312
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,791
and then the EMP took out
everything electrical just like that.

313
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,752
It was a good thing I was at work.

314
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,671
What are you doing?

315
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:27,508
I was locating the cheese.

316
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,385
Come here.

317
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:34,097
But, Finch,
you said up there it's like Swiss cheese.

318
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,184
-I was locating the cheese.
-Hey, this is not a joke.

319
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,561
I don't wear this UV suit for fun.

320
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:43,815
This is not a joke.
I don't wear this UV suit for fun.

321
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,234
Why are you imitating me?

322
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,694
You said watch then imitate.

323
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,905
-Stop imitating me.
-Sorry.

324
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,406
And stop apologizing.

325
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,699
Stopping.

326
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,828
Lesson number three is:

327
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,707
Never willfully destroy
somebody else's property.

328
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,047
A little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.

329
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,262
Help me open this door.

330
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:22,896
Muscle.

331
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,315
That was a little too much muscle.

332
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,569
Can you simplify?

333
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,237
That's a figure of speech.

334
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,574
It's another way of saying something,
like the cheese.

335
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:34,992
Like the cheese.

336
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:38,286
Yeah, like the cheese. Except not exactly.

337
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,456
Finch, this is a play
by William Shakespeare.

338
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,210
A dramatic comedy about love,

339
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:50,340
deception, and other human misunders--

340
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,342
Never really cared for the theater.

341
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:06,148
Lesson number four:

342
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:09,151
Use your initiative.

343
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:15,449
-Finch, do you think this is safe to eat?
-Hold this.

344
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,160
-It is approximately 15 years old.
-Just like that.

345
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:21,205
Now why do you think
they called it popcorn, huh?

346
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:28,212
Lesson number five: Live a little.

347
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,296
Go ahead.

348
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,548
Yeah.

349
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,055
Again.

350
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,767
Again, again!

351
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,105
Again, again!

352
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,362
<i>Tornado detection. Shelter advised.</i>

353
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,844
<i>Air pressure--</i>

354
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:21,473
Damn it. I thought it would break up
before it reached this altitude.

355
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,977
<i>Body temperature high, 102.2.</i>

<i>Air pressure drop.</i>

357
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,066
Finch, there is something rattling around
inside of my head.

358
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,359
<i>Shelter advised.</i>

359
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,946
<i>-Tornado warning. Shelter advised.</i>

360
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,573

00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,575
<i>Tornado warning. Shelter advised.</i>

Stay, boy. Stay.

364
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:50,752
We need to tie the RV down
with these spikes and the winches.

365
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,881
You see what I'm doing?

366
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:57,926
You need to imitate me exactly.
Understand?

367
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,052
Understand.

368
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,512
<i>1,800 feet.</i>

<i>Shelter advised.</i>

374
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,906
All right, the next one.
Give me the next one.

375
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:27,206
<i>-Tornado warning. 1,400 feet.</i>
-I still can't see anything.

-Come on. Oh, my God. Come on.
<i>-Caution. Heart rate high.</i>

00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,384
You can do this.

378
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,306
You should return
to the recreational vehicle.

379

<i>1,200 feet.</i>

00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,574

Get in the back.

390
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,733
-The back. The back.
-Dewey! Not you.

391
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:37,818
<i>300 feet.</i>

392
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,778
Finch, what should I do?

393
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,238
Hang on to something.

394
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,323
<i>-200 feet.</i>
-Who's a good boy?

395
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:45,701
Holding on, Finch.

396
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:57,004
<i>50 feet. Extreme caution.</i>

397
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,589
<i>Shelter advised.</i>

398
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,222
I am okay.

399
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,225
Everyone okay?

400
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:52,726
You good, boy?

401
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,478
Dewey? You?

402
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,316
Thanks. I wondered what happened to that.

403
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,581
This could have gone better.

404
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,671
He used his muscle on that.

405
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,887
Hey. Good job.

406
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,649
Finch.

407
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,025
Damn it.

408
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:50,617
We have been very fortunate.
Extremely fortunate.

409
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:56,874
The Fleetwood Southwind
is not known for its safety features.

410
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:59,168
-Did you know that--
-Did you find the jack?

411
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:06,633
I have located a spare but no jack.

412
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:11,096
Great. Shredded tire, no jack.

413
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,767
Mistakes will get you killed, Weinberg.
You should know that by now.

414
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:17,477
Finch.

415
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,566
Initiative.

416
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,411
All right.

417
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,496
Okay, let her down.

418
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:39,625
Good.

419
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:48,050
I really enjoyed being a jack.

420
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,386
You do make a good jack.

421
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,390
You know, we...

422
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,395
We should consider giving you a name.

423
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,941
I would like that very much.

424
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,150
Well, how about Jack?

425
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,737
No, Jack is a tool's name.

426
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:15,035
How about William Shakespeare?
Will you call me William Shakespeare?

427
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,161
That's taken.

428
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:21,083
Maybe something a little less complicated.
You know? Keep it simple.

429
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,545
Napoleon Bonaparte.

430
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,464
Napoleon was short.

431
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,469
And what is wrong with being short?

432
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:36,265
Nothing at all. It's just that
you are not short. You're very tall.

433
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,268
I am very tall.

434
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,482
I like the name Rover.

435
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,610
Rover is a dog's name.

436
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:52,072
I was thinking of
the early Mars planetary lander.

437
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:57,452
Okay. Still, maybe something
a little less complicated or appropriate.

438
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:00,372
Maybe you want something
that's not already a dog's name?

439
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,791
No.

440
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,920
Why doesn't the dog have a name?

441
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,589
He does have a name.

442
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,133
It's Goodyear.

443
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,635
I like that name.

444
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,847
Why not use it? He is your dog after all.

445
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,265
Well, he's not my dog.

446
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,643
He is his own dog.

447
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:25,772
Besides, with just the two of us,
who needs names?

448
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,159
Jeff.

449
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:40,704
Jeff?

450
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,623
Jeff.

451
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,585
Jeff. Really?

452
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,129
Have I said something funny?

453
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:51,840
No. No, absolutely not. No.

454
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,675
It is short and simple.

455
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:54,760
Yes, it is.

456
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:57,679
-Just like you suggested, Finch.
-Yeah.

457
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,806
And I've checked.

458
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,727
It isn't a dog's name.

459
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,479
No, it's not. For the life of me,

460
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,983
I cannot ever remember
a dog named Jeff, so...

461
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:12,736
Then, with your permission, Finch...

462
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,863
None required.

463
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,156
Give me your hand.

464
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,283
Other hand. Corresponding hand.

465
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,077
And shake hands.

466
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:23,080
Welcome to the world, Jeff.

467
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,935
Hey, hey, hey!

468
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,524
What's going on with all the fuss?

469
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:55,070
I thought our communication might improve
if I learn to talk dog.

470
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:04,580
I have made a comparative analysis.

471
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:08,041
I believe I have isolated
several root phonetic units.

472
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,880
However, it seems to have misunderstood
everything I have said.

473
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:16,049
-What is the matter with it, Finch?
-It's not an "it."

474
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,635
It's a "him."

475
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,722
There's no such thing as dog talk.

476
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,224
I don't think it likes me.

477
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,769
Well, he doesn't trust you yet.

478
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,315
That takes time.

479
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:28,956
Finch, I'm not sure I understand
this concept of trust.

480
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,875
Can you explain for me, please?

481
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:35,254
Okay. Trust is when we...

482
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:42,678
Well, trust is how we, you know, trust.

483
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:43,762
It's...

484
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,765
Well, how about if I tell you a story?

485
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,644
Are you going to tell me
a story about trust?

486
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,105
Well, it's a story about me. All right.

487
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:59,194
All right, so once upon a time,

488
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:02,322
back when I was a junior at Tri Alpha,

489
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:06,702
word came from up top
that I was gonna be put on a team

490
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:09,162
that was developing the RMS system.

491
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,374
Problem was that I didn't really
like working on a team,

492
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,334
-so I was having some problems--
-Why didn't you like

493
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:15,627
working on a team, Finch?

494
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,880
Because my team
was a bunch of knuckleheads.

495
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,299
-Put that down. Put that down.
-What's a knuckle--

496
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:21,550
What's a knucklehead?

497
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:25,929
I just worked better by myself, okay?
Now listen.

498
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,767
-Listening.
-All right.

499
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:35,189
Now, we were having real problems
getting the OS to talk to the hardware.

500
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:39,860
And the team was certain
that it was a hardware issue.

501
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,821
But I knew it wasn't.
It was something else.

502
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,406
And guess who cracked it?

503
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,621
Well, anyway, that doesn't matter.

504
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,706
The next thing I know,

505
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:58,295
is Doctor Norman Rostoker,
who founded TAE Technologies,

506
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,630
he pays us a visit.

507
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,007
And that is a big deal.

508
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,053
He pats us on the back
and then he singles me out.

509
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,679
He says, "Weinberg."

510
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:11,642
The man knows my name.

511
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:13,810
That's right. He said,

512
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:19,191
"Weinberg, I heard you figured this out
all by yourself. Is that true?"

513
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:22,319
And I had to think about that
for a minute.

514
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,489
But then I knew what I had to say.

515
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,992
And so I told him
I couldn't have done it without my team.

516
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,745
But you said your team were
a bunch of knuckleheads.

517
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:34,790
Well, he looked me right in the eye,
and he knew I was lying.

518
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,710
But he also knew I had my team's back.

519
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:43,131
So he gave me this wink and told us all,

520
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:45,801
"Teamwork. That's the key."

521
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:48,971
Teamwork is the key.

522
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,222
-Yeah.
-Wink, wink.

523
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:51,306
That's right.

524
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:54,810
That's right.

525
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:08,198
I'm not sure I understand
what the story was about, Finch.

526
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:11,702
-Well, think about it.
-I am.

527
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:15,080
It's about building trust
and getting other people to trust you.

528
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:18,792
Yes, but you didn't actually
trust your team, Finch.

529
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,336
And I found the story
quite hard to follow.

530
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,671
May I suggest--

531
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,090
Finch.

532
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,594
Finch, would you like me to drive?

533
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,334
<i>-UV radiation detected, 141 degrees.</i>
-I just need a few minutes.

534
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:01,710
I want you two...

535
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:07,007
to start working on...

536
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,093
that trust.

537
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,678
-Okay?
-Like in the story?

538
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,389
Yeah, yeah. Just like in the story.

539
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:16,683
Stay in the shade.

540
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:49,925
Come on.

541
00:50:53,512 --> 00:50:54,680
Come on.

542
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,145
-Hey, no.
-Come on.

543
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,064
No. No, no, not that way.

544
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,691
-Come on.
-Come on.

545
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:06,984
Come here. Okay, okay.

546
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,610
Give me this. Give me this.

547
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:10,279
Hey, come on, boy. Come on.

548
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:12,322
There you go. Yeah.

549
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,408
I told you he doesn't like me.

550
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,744
You just stay here.

551
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:19,872
Guard the fort.

552
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,377
What should we have?

553
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,797
Get your elbows off the table.

554
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:14,676
Get your elbows off the table.
Off the table. Down.

555
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,027
Mac and cheese.

556
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,993
I'm gonna get a triple-decker turkey club.

557
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,253
Shit.

558
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,379
Stay.

559
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:58,512
Hey!

560
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,681
No! Hey, hey, come. Hey.

561
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:02,432
Come here. Good, good, good.

562
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:06,687
Stay.

563
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,691
Hey, what's going on, Jeff?

564
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:14,319
Nothing.

565
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:18,782
Did you just drive the RV?

566
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,492
No.

567
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:23,871
No?

568
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,707
It did roll though.

569
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,877
Oh, okay. Good.

570
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,173
Because I don't think you're quite ready
to drive the RV yet.

571
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,593
I have seen you drive.

572
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,097
Are you upset?

573
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,602
I need you to listen to me, okay?

574
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:49,146
Okay.

575
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:52,691
I want you to fetch the UV suit
and bring it to me.

576
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:57,237
The helmet, the cooling unit,
everything, okay?

577
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,074
Okay.

578
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,202
Is that understood?

579
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,495
Understood.

580
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,562
No, no! No!

581
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,439
No!

582
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:33,982
No, no!

583
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:35,108
No!

584
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:36,193
I meant on foot!

585
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:39,071
No, stop! Stop!

586
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,702
I am an excellent driver.

587
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,498
Come here.

588
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:12,437
UV doesn't discriminate.
Dog skin, human skin, they both fry.

589
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:15,899
-I thought you wanted me--
-You have one job to do.

590
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,819
Take care of this dog.
It's the reason I made you.

591
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,988
It's the only reason you exist.

592
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,114
The fourth directive.

593
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:24,157
I don't need companionship.
I don't need a friend.

594
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:25,826
I need you to do your job.

595
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:27,870
I'm sorry. I am--

596
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:31,123
I know you were born yesterday,
but it's time for you to grow up!

597
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:57,733
God's honest truth, you were
a crazy gamble from start to finish.

598
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,655
You just need to understand
how vulnerable we are.

599
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,661
What do you think?

600
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,790
Now is as good a time as any.

601
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,751
What for?

602
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,342
Now gently. Very gently.

603
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:26,637
Give it just a little gas.

604
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,180
Don't rush it.

605
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,933
Just very gently.

606
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:33,227
That's not gently.

607
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,479
-Sorry.
-You know what gently means.

608
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:36,563
Easy.

609
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:39,733
Easy now. Easy.

610
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:42,027
Easy.

611
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,783
Don't oversteer.

612
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,412
Yeah, you've oversteered.
That's oversteering.

613
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,498
-Sorry.
-Ease your foot up just a hair.

614
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,418
Good.

615
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,004
Good.

616
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,341
All right. Now keep it steady,
just like this.

617
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:06,718
Perfect.

618
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,892
I know-- Eyes on the road.

619
00:57:15,936 --> 00:57:18,397
Now, she's a little thirsty,
but I made some modifications.

620
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,901
So if we can keep it steady,
under 50, we should be okay.

621
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,321
Good. Yeah.

622
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,825
I am an excellent driver.

623
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:31,702
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

624
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:32,953
Eyes on the road.

625
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:38,625
See, rain man? You're just an apprentice.

626
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,004
Then I am an excellent apprentice.

627
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,321
San Francisco, here we come!

628
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,711
What a cold night. It's been a long time.

629
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:27,424
Finch.

630
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,552
It's the aurora borealis.

631
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,180
Yeah?

632
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,934
Only now you don't have to be
in Alaska to see it.

633
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,728
You can thank the flare for that.

634
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:42,189
Goodbye, ozone.

635
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,568
Goodbye, feeling the sun on your face.

636
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:52,574
Vegetation and crops and food.
Goodbye, everything.

637
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,415
And yet, here we are.

638
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,086
Yes.

639
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,380
Here we are, Finch.

640
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,511
May I ask you something?

641
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:18,517
If daylight is so dangerous,
why are we not traveling at night?

642
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:26,191
You think if traveling at night were safe,
I wouldn't know that by now?

643
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,695
Where are we headed?

644
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,323
The Golden Gate Bridge.

645
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,117
Into the unknown.

646
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:44,459
Dust and smoke and 150-degree heat
and UV radiation, that I can handle.

647
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,961
Why?

648
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:48,213
Why?

649
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,424
Because it's predictable.

650
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:58,765
Moving at night presents
that which is not predictable.

651
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,769
People.

652
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:08,275
Starving people hiding in the shadows.
People who mean you harm.

653
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:09,651
People you cannot trust.

654
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,571
But why? How do you know
you can't trust those people?

655
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:14,364
Because trust will get you killed.

656
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:17,367
Trust no one.

657
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,339
You're mad at me again.

658
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:46,146
Look, things will happen to you.

659
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,526
Things that you cannot control.

660
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,696
Raw emotion will find you.

661
01:00:55,405 --> 01:01:00,494
When it does, how you deal with it,
what you do...

662
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,038
will define who you are.

663
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,378
Did that happen to you?

664
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:12,214
It happens to all of us.

665
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,716
Whether we want it to or not.

666
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:28,355
It's too cold.

667
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,859
Too cold for these old bones.

668
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:45,497
Finch, I think I might stay here awhile
if that's okay with you.

669
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,500
Okay.

670
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:49,960
Okay.

671
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,021
You're unwell.

672
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,990
What would you like me to do?

673
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:07,746
Call a doctor.

674
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,851
Good boy. Stay.

675
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:55,729
Come on, Dewey.

676
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:57,397
Let's get this show on the road.

677
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:01,276
Lesson number one:

678
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,239
Never pass on the opportunity
for your next meal.

679
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,244
Lesson number two...

680
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:13,539
Never willfully destroy
another person's property.

681
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,709
But a little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.

682
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:21,129
That's a figure of speech, by the way.

683
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,307
Come, Dewey.

684
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,690
Lesson number three:

685
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,736
Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.

686
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:50,158
<i>UV radiation high, 144 degrees.</i>

687
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:51,285
<i>Caution.</i>

688
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:57,332
Hey.

689
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:02,713
<i>Stay here.</i>

690
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:05,090
Guard the fort.

691
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:11,930
Oh, no.

692
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:18,187
Lesson number four: Use your initiative.

693
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,310
Medicine.

694
01:06:58,393 --> 01:06:59,603
Medicine.

695
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:00,729
Initiative.

696
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:10,614
Lesson number five: Live a little.

697
01:07:19,498 --> 01:07:20,666
Not bad.

698
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,087
Stay, boy.

699
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:24,938
Initiative, initiative,
initiative, initiative!

700
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,518
Oh, no.

701
01:09:15,154 --> 01:09:16,323
I'm sorry, Dewey.

702
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:42,724
Come on.

703
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,570
Finch.

704
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,406
Do you like my new coat?

705
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:58,448
What are you doing?

706
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,826
Have you listened to me at all?

707
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,453
But-- But initiative, Finch.

708
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:06,164
Initiative requires common sense.

709
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:08,917
If you had any, you'd know
there's something wrong with this place.

710
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,380
Finch, do you think--

711
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:14,464
Walk away now.

712
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:23,182
Finch.

713
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,062
Where's Dewey?

714
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:30,689
Dewey's gone.

715
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:43,076
<i>Heart rate high, 150 bpm.</i>

716
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:46,163
The door. Get the door.

717
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:55,964
<i>Caution.</i>

718
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:57,591
<i>Heart rate high.</i>

719
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,615
Here, take this.

720
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:25,327
<i>-Caution.</i>
-Now come take the wheel.

721
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,455
<i>Body temperature high, 104.8.</i>

722
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:31,291
<i>Blood pressure high.</i>

723
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,876
-May I make a suggestion--
-No!

724
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:36,463
No, you may not. That was a trap
and you walked right into it.

725
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:41,510
Dewey was one of us and now he's gone
all because of your stupid mistake.

726
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:44,555
<i>-Caution. Heart rate high.</i>
-Come on, boy.

727
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:46,723
Come on. Here, boy. Come on, boy. Go. Go.

728
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,270
From now on, there's a new set of rules.

729
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,981
No more mistakes.
We can't afford that anymore.

730
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:01,613
What would you like me to do?

731
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:03,866
Drive. We need the miles.

732
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:41,320
Are you okay?

733
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:43,322
We're being followed.

734
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:45,282
We are?

735
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:46,992
By who?

736
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,327
I don't want to find out.

737
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,498
You can still see, right?

738
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,126
I can see.

739
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:05,302
We-- We have to lose him.

740
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:08,263
Floor it. Floor it.
Put your foot on the gas.

741
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:11,475
-But the Fleetwood manual says--
-Do it. Just do it. Do it now!

742
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:33,997
Go. Go! Go faster.

743
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:44,716
May I make a suggestion, Finch?

744
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,052
-We have to get off this road.
-What are you doing?

745
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,096
-Overpass. That means an underpass.
-I don't understand.

746
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:52,599
Now. Now! Hard left!

747
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,869
Go. Go! Why are you stopping?

748
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:13,745
We have to hide! Go!

749
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,414
We have to go now!

750
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:16,957
-Finch, I think--
-Now! Go!

751
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,041
Finch.

752
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,586
Maximum height of
this particular underpass

753
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,462
is 13 feet and 7 inches.

754
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:24,840
With the basic customizations
of the vehicle, we're--

755
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,176
Finch!

756
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,228
-Finch?
-What have I done?

757
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:48,614
No! No, Jeff!

758
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,838
I think they're gone, Finch.

759
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:40,642
We're not gonna make it.

760
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:49,902
It's over.

761
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:59,953
I'm too old. I'm too sick.
I'm too tired. I'm done.

762
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,498
Finch, it's gonna rain.
You know what that means--

763
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,584
Stop it. Stop it. Just accept it.

764
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,836
It's over.

765
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:10,047
No.

766
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:11,757
We can't give up.

767
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:14,927
I will not allow you to give up.

768
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,094
You will not allow it?

769
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:19,515
Well, you don't get to decide
because you're just a machine.

770
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:21,850
A robot cannot harm a human or,
through inaction,

771
01:17:21,934 --> 01:17:23,352
allow a human to come to harm.

772
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:24,436
Shut up!

773
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:33,463
May I ask you something?

774
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:38,552
Do you think we'll make it
to the Golden Gate Bridge?

775
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,223
I think we will.

776
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,060
You wanna know why?

777
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,857
Because I believe in you, Finch.

778
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,655
Can I tell you a story?

779
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:02,868
Okay.

780
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:05,120
Once upon a time...

781
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:08,332
there was a solar flare.

782
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:19,301
But the flare didn't finish us off.
We did that to ourselves.

783
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:25,432
Some people hid and locked their doors.

784
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:27,935
Tried to pretend
that it wasn't really happening.

785
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:29,645
And they didn't last very long.

786
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:34,149
The rest of us did what we had to do
to survive.

787
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:37,778
We scavenged and we fought over
whatever was left behind

788
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,488
until there was nothing left.

789
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,370
I was searching this supermarket.

790
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:49,665
And the place had been
pretty well cleaned out,

791
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:55,546
but occasionally something gets overlooked
and you get lucky.

792
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:00,217
<i>And I found a bag of noodles.</i>

793
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,848
<i>But before I could leave...</i>

794
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:11,270
<i>this mother and her kid show up,</i>

795
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:14,690
<i>and they have a shopping cart
filled with their things.</i>

796
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:17,484
<i>The little girl couldn't have been
more than nine years old.</i>

797
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,029
She had a pink unicorn backpack.

798
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,451
And she was holding a gun in her hands.

799
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:31,832
And I heard the mom say,
"Remember, if you see anyone,

800
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:35,210
you point at them
and you do like I showed you, okay?"

801
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,923
<i>And then I realized that if she sees me,</i>

802
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:43,218
this little girl's gonna shoot me
and take my noodles.

803
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:46,471
So I hid.

804
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:51,643
<i>And waited until they were done.</i>

805
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,609
But as they were leaving,
this station wagon pulled up.

806
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:04,573
And the driver got out
because he'd seen the little girl.

807
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:08,160
And he was yelling,

808
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:12,164
and he was waving a shotgun around
like a crazy man.

809
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:16,168
He'd seen the cart
and he wanted what was in it.

810
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:19,254
So he was hollering,
"Hand it over. Hand it over."

811
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:22,424
And then the mom ran up
and she was yelling at him,

812
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:23,967
"Leave us alone."

813
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:28,055
And the little girl is terrified and...

814
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:31,642
she didn't know where to point the gun.

815
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,979
<i>She was crying.</i>

816
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:39,233
And they were both screaming.

817
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,364
And then bang, bang, bang.

818
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,585
It all happened so fast.

819
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:08,971
By the time he left
and I was able to get to them,

820
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,806
it was too late.

821
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,027
Then I heard this sound.

822
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,366
This tiny whimpering...

823
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:35,455
coming from the girl's pink backpack.

824
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:45,424
<i>And so I opened it.</i>

825
01:22:54,600 --> 01:23:00,731
And there was this shivering,
tiny, little thing.

826
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:05,068
So frightened.

827
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,988
And so alone.

828
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,331
Hunger turned men into murderers.

829
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,250
But made...

830
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:24,630
made me a coward.

831
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,306
How can you believe in that?

832
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:10,968
You see that?

833
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,263
San Francisco.

834
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,182
Finch.

835
01:24:18,684 --> 01:24:20,811
Only 480 miles.

836
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:32,948
"Dad."

837
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:35,909
Dad.

838
01:24:43,584 --> 01:24:46,837
<i>UV radiation low. Non-critical.</i>

839
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,571
I think you need to come and see this.

840
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:15,490
-Finch!
-What?

841
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:18,744
-What?
-Right there.

842
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:24,333
I didn't mean to hit it.

843
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:56,031
I thought you said it...

844
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,408
Swiss cheese.

845
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:18,762
I don't know.

846
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,835
This is excellent, Jeff.

847
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:16,588
This is the best meal I've had
in a long, long time.

848
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:25,889
Guess what?

849
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:26,974
What?

850
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,770
I saw it in my head last night.

851
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:33,272
In your head?

852
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:38,026
The three of us were on
the Golden Gate Bridge,

853
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,445
like a painting that hasn't been yet.

854
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:43,991
Wow!

855
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:48,078
Jeff, you had a dream?

856
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:53,500
That blows my mind.

857
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:57,546
I would love to see you
five or six years from now.

858
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:00,924
I'm not a disappointment?

859
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:03,177
Of course not. No.

860
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:07,181
And I shouldn't have called you a machine.

861
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,018
May I ask you something?

862
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:15,564
You said that the Golden Gate Bridge card
was from your uncle,

863
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:19,651
but on the back it's signed "Dad."

864
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,529
Why is that?

865
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:25,741
Boy, you don't miss a thing, do you?

866
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:27,242
No, I don't.

867
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:32,456
Well, I think it's time for another story.

868
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:39,296
Well...

869
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:47,596
My mom always said my dad
had Viking blood in him.

870
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,767
You didn't say, "Once upon a time."

871
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:55,312
Okay. And once upon a time...

872
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:57,272
he left us.

873
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,193
It was before I was born.

874
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:03,195
He was in the army.

875
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:07,866
An engineer of some kind, evidently.
Built bridges.

876
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,119
And he was always traveling.
We never had any contact.

877
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:17,751
And then on my 15th birthday,
that postcard shows up out of the blue.

878
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,295
The one with the Golden Gate Bridge.

879
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:23,590
And he wrote on it
he hoped we could meet one day.

880
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:29,346
Meantime I was supposed to
go off and see the world.

881
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,808
And he signed it "Dad" and I treasured it.

882
01:30:34,142 --> 01:30:37,729
In fact, as soon as I was old enough,
I went out and I bought this fancy suit.

883
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:41,066
And I thought, well,
when we finally do meet,

884
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:44,653
I wanted to impress him
and make him feel proud of me.

885
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:49,449
Never heard from him again.

886
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:55,873
And did you?

887
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:58,333
Did I what?

888
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,085
Did you go see the world?

889
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:05,132
Well, I went to New York City once.

890
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,134
-Yeah?
-I didn't much care for it.

891
01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:09,219
It was crowded and dirty.

892
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:14,224
And apart from that I've never been
much further than Missouri.

893
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:15,893
But there was always something.

894
01:31:15,976 --> 01:31:21,481
You know, my health or my work,
Mom, the end of the world.

895
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:26,778
Yeah, I...

896
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:30,407
I just never got around to it.

897
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:38,832
What about the other postcards?
Why are they all blank?

898
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:43,921
Well, whenever I saw one I liked,
I would buy it.

899
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:48,258
You know, sort of a collection.
Something for the bucket list, I guess.

900
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:49,551
I don't know.

901
01:31:52,638 --> 01:31:55,057
Like, we humans
are full of contradictions.

902
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,772
You see, you can already tell me

903
01:32:01,855 --> 01:32:04,441
how many rivets
are in the Golden Gate Bridge.

904
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:08,946
And how many miles of cable were used
and how high it is.

905
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:14,618
But it's not until you actually
stand on it and see the beauty,

906
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:19,081
and listen to the suspension cables
singing in the wind...

907
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:20,582
That's experience.

908
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,710
That's human experience.

909
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:28,090
It's not just imagining, it's living.

910
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:33,720
But you've never actually been
to the Golden Gate Bridge, Finch.

911
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:37,724
No, Jeff, I've never been.

912
01:32:37,808 --> 01:32:39,184
Thank you.

913
01:32:40,143 --> 01:32:43,188
Like I said,
humans are full of contradictions.

914
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:49,653
I wish I'd done more with the time I had.

915
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:56,326
Well, then let's leave right now, Finch!

916
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,578
We'll leave right now.

917
01:32:57,661 --> 01:33:01,915
And if we leave right now,
it'll only be 18 hours, 33 minutes--

918
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:03,542
I'm dying, Jeff.

919
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:06,795
I'm gonna die.

920
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:19,933
When I'm gone...

921
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:24,730
do you promise
to do what's right for Goodyear?

922
01:33:44,249 --> 01:33:45,375
Where's your ball?

923
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:48,253
Is it here? Is that your ball?

924
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:50,714
Is that your ball?

925
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:55,177
Is that your ball?

926
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,096
Where's your ball? Where's your ball?

927
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:04,645
Go! Get it.

928
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:14,530
Come on. All right. Okay.

929
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:15,822
Now you try it.

930
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:18,992
Yeah. Yeah. You throw it.

931
01:34:21,662 --> 01:34:22,788
Go ahead. Throw it.

932
01:34:23,956 --> 01:34:25,916
This kind of stuff's important.

933
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,876
Where's your ball?

934
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,671
Where's your ball? Is it here? Is it here?

935
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:32,297
Just throw it.

936
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:34,258
Is this your ball?

937
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:36,301
Is this your ball?

938
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:38,804
-Throw the ball.
-Here, boy.

939
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:40,681
Where's your ball?

940
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:42,558
Throw the ball.

941
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:43,725
Come on!

942
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:52,651
Hey, Finch!

943
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:54,069
Yeah.

944
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:56,780
Here, boy!

945
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:00,617
Come on, boy. No.

946
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:12,588
-Again.
-But he returned it to you.

947
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:15,716
Well, that's 'cause dogs
are creatures of habit.

948
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:42,784
Here, boy!

949
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:44,703
Come on.

950
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:46,371
Please?

951
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:48,665
Do it.

952
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,627
Good boy. Good--

953
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,552
I told you he doesn't like me.

954
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:03,597
You two will-- You'll figure it out.

955
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,141
Come on. Trust me.

956
01:36:26,787 --> 01:36:29,414
Look what I did to ruin my fancy suit.

957
01:36:33,335 --> 01:36:34,461
I got you.

958
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,421
It's okay.

959
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:41,635
It's okay.

960
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:45,264
Try and breathe, Finch. Try and breathe.

961
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:53,814
I'm just gonna lay down for a while.
You two play.

962
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:55,607
You two go.

963
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:58,694
-Go play.
-Can I do something, Finch?

964
01:37:05,576 --> 01:37:06,785
Jeff, you already have.

965
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:09,663
Shake my hand.

966
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,048
No.

967
01:38:01,507 --> 01:38:02,508
No.

968
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,379
What am I gonna do?

969
01:42:14,134 --> 01:42:15,135
What am I gonna do?

970
01:42:21,183 --> 01:42:22,809
What are you gonna do, Jeff?

971
01:42:26,563 --> 01:42:27,981
What would Finch do?

972
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:31,443
He'd feed the dog.

973
01:42:33,612 --> 01:42:34,655
I'm gonna feed the dog.

974
01:42:50,546 --> 01:42:51,588
Oh, shit.

975
01:46:00,444 --> 01:46:03,197
{\an8}<i>You see, you can already tell me</i>

976
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,116
<i>how many rivets are
in the Golden Gate Bridge.</i>

977
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:11,955
<i>And how many miles of cable were used
and how high it is.</i>

978
01:46:15,584 --> 01:46:20,964
<i>But it's not until you actually

980
01:46:26,553 --> 01:46:27,763

981
01:46:30,724 --> 01:46:32,518
<i>That's human experience.</i>

982
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:41,443
Looks like we're not the only ones
who came this way.

983
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,200
You think they're still out there?

984
01:46:51,328 --> 01:46:53,288
Well, there's only one way to find out.

985
01:47:05,008 --> 01:47:06,218
It's beautiful.

986
