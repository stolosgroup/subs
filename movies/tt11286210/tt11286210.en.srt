When you go to a school
that's nearly as old as the country,

you can expect to hear a few.

41
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:04,536
Like, maybe you've heard that
FDR was rejected from Ancaster

42

and had to settle for his safety school...

I can say that two U.S. presidents
and an army of senators

46

count this school as their alma mater.

But believe me when I say

52
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,778
the only thing
that will haunt you this year

53
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,905
is that extra slice of pizza.

56
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,206
to be stepping into the role
of Belleville House master

57

for the first time.

58
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:55,421
As master,
I am more than just a professor.

59
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,549
Consider me a confidante,

60
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,927
an ally, a friend.

61
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:05,222
And if you ever need anything,
I live right there,

66

You will never go back home again.

67
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,913

Seriously, it's-it's real.

191

The Witch chooses a freshman every year.

Oh, shit, I forgot about Treasure.

195
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,753
She lost it.

I mean, what-what happened?

00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,599
The Witch shows herself to a freshman.

And then one night,

I think we can all agree.

215
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,396
I mean, let's just take a look at Pearl.

216
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,318
This little girl is 90% symbolism,
ten percent precocious statements.

217
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,111
What do y'all make of her?

218
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,031
Professor Beckman?

00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,491
Call me Liv.

220
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,909
And just chime in.

221
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,410
Raising hands is for high school.

222
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:48,745
Sorry.

223
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,708
I think it's kind of ironic
that Hester named her Pearl.

224
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,293
How so?

225
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,671
Pearls are associated
with the color white,

226
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:03,009
so we connect her with purity,
innocence and all.

227
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:07,430
Pearl should be read as innocent
because of her association with white.

228
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:08,723
Who agrees?

229
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,398
Well, um, Professor Beckman...

230
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,566
Liv.

231
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:22,070
I think that, at the time,
the color white was connected with purity.

232
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,613
Symbolically.

233
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,908
But then there was that part
she was screaming

234
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,910
at the village kids in tongues.

235
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:30,912
So...

236
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:35,875
obviously, some of her behavior
isn't supposed to be innocent.

237
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,170
Or that's exactly the point

238
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:42,882
and Pearl is basically the white woman

239
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,552
come to bring Hester down.

240
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,764
Hester representing
all nonconforming women, of course.

00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,217
Have you read <i>Disgrace?</i>

329
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,845
Now, I think you could
make a case for that.

...let's reach back to the Arendt reading.

333
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,520
Thank you so much. Good work.

334
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,106
The fact that you all were able
to put that together...

335
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:09,774
Oh. Oh, we-we just...

336
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,401
we thank you so much for coming.

337
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,861
- Oh, yeah, no.
- We love you.

338
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,488
You're our favorite teacher ever.

339
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,407
Thank you, Sascha.
Such creative work, though.

340
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,783
I'll see you on Tuesday.

341
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,340
That's Margaret Millett?

342
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,634
Clever girl.

343
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,678
We're doing a whole series
on the witch trials

344
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,014
ahead of the anniversary on December 3.

345
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,101
They said that she died
at 3:33 in the morning.

346
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,061
According to the legend.

347
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,273
Anyway, that's all a long time ago.

348
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,859
Oh, no procrastinating here, I see.

(chuckles)

350

You've clearly got
a good head on your shoulders.

351
00:19:56,571 --> 00:20:00,783
Figuratively, maybe,
but dragging all these books around

352
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,494
has completely wrecked my whole posture.

490
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,336
It-it's not the grade, and it's not me.

491
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,339
It's her.

492
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,508
(lively chatter)

493
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,134
I heard they tried
to poach him to Dartmouth,

494
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,970
but then he'd have to move
to New Hampshire,

495
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,763
and you know how he feels about snow.

496
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,307
She's taking a sabbatical
to write a novel...

497
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,433
a YA trilogy.

498
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,851
It's completely shocking.

499
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,728
- Heart attack...
- What?

500
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,355
...in the middle of the lecture hall.

501
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,399
- (laughter)
- You know, whatever, no judgment.

502
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,026
I just, I didn't know that was his genre.

503
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,445
(chatter continues)

504
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,155
Honestly, I think she's

505
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,449
the perfect tenure candidate
for right now.

506
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,118
What's now?

507
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:12,788
She's incredibly popular with students,
several of whom wrote testimonials...

508
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,206
15 of them.

509
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,625
And let's be honest.

510
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,502
Liv Beckman is a woman of color

511
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,714
in a faculty overwhelmingly not...

512
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,216
...of color.

513
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,927
LAM: That is the image
that Ancaster should have,

514
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,887
- not boring...
- DIANDRA: Irrelevant.

515
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:33,642
What we have to decide is,
on the basis of what is in here,

516
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:36,604
does Professor Beckman
deserve to be tenured?

517
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,856
It's a privilege.
It's not a right.

518
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,357
You'd know something about privilege.

519
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:43,527
Well, her published work is thin
to the point of nonexistence.

520
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,112
GAIL:
Let's be fair.

521
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,614
Liv has published.

522
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,033
Maybe not a ton, but enough.

523
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,413
Gail, do you really think
that you could be impartial?

524
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:56,540
Why?

525
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:57,875
Oh, she's your friend.

526
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,460
JULIANNE:
Are you seriously trying

527
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:00,919
to disenfranchise her right now?

528
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,838
I am perfectly capable
of being professional.

529
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,173
DIANDRA:
You're right.

530
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,969
Actually, I'm surprised
that you don't agree.

531
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,262
When you were tenured,

532
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,182
you'd already had two books published
and how many articles?

533
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,018
- Too many.
- Right. A ton.

534
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:19,063
We have all been through the process,

535
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:23,567
and we know how grueling it is,
but we earned it.

536
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:28,197
We can look each other in the face
and know that we belong here.

537
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,076
Imagine if that's brought into question.

538
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,123
(sighs)

539
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,294
I-I... you know, I-I do have...

540
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,004
(sighs)

541
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,673
...some doubts about Liv.

542
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:50,636
A freshman in her seminar approached me
with a grade complaint,

543
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,013
and she's filing a dispute
with the registrar.

544
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:54,598
So...

545
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,893
Grade grubbing is like an extracurricular
with these kids.

546
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,144
GAIL:
Well, yeah, I know,

547
00:32:59,228 --> 00:33:00,938
but she thinks Liv is targeting her,

548
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,650
so now OSL is doing
a performance review and...

549
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,861
This... this is news to me.

550
00:33:07,945 --> 00:33:09,488
That definitely changes things.

551
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:14,284
What I'm gonna suggest is
that we table this for today and reconvene

552
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,037
when more of the details
come out in the wash.

553
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:21,500
Now, African dance is in 15, so...
let's give 'em time to move the tables.

554
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,421
Thanks for speaking up, Gail.

555
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,799
We really needed your voice at the table.

556

You know my daughter from the college.

So, uh, when you feel ready,

DIANDRA:
Well, published work, obviously it's just

946

one factor in tenure review, so usually,

947
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:23,597
in instances where
publishing is light, um,

948
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,934
an application could lean
more heavily on other factors,

949
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,938
such as classroom performance
and engagement.

950

01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,318
I place classroom instruction
above everything else.

952

So you could understand
why the current dispute

filed against you
is of particular concern.

Well...

955
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:48,997

962

The issue...

963
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:14,440
is this school.

964
01:02:15,816 --> 01:02:18,318
Why is this administration
spending more energy

965
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:21,947
on undermining my application for tenure
than on ferreting out the racist

966
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,574
who's been terrorizing the student body?

967
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,492
I don't understand what the two have to...

968
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,119
Last week, someone lit a cross on fire.

969
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,496
This isn't an incident.
It's an emergency.

970
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,666
I will not allow myself
to be scapegoated by a school

971
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:36,336
that is unable or unwilling
to see itself for what it truly is.

972
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,589
If anyone really wanted
to help that girl, it would be

973
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,176
by ending the culture of hatred
that vandalizes students' rooms,

974
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,678
undervalues the work
of professors of color

975
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,139
and compels me to come
stand before all of you today.

01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:31,515
Thanks.

1307
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:42,026
And it's never gonna change.

1308
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,410
Well, all of this...
all of this tension at work

1309
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:55,581
and all of this... just everything going on
is just really just in my body, just...

1310
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,416
I think with you it's emotional.

Faculty?

1317
01:29:25,778 --> 01:29:27,321
Mind if I look at your I.D.?

1318
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,364
- No.
- Appreciate it.

1319
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:30,449
I'll just give it a quick scan, then...

1320
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:31,533
No, I mean...

1321
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,454
...I don't work here.

1322
01:29:35,537 --> 01:29:37,289
I was just on my way out.

1323
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,791
Oh.

1324
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,668
Well, the exit's that way.
