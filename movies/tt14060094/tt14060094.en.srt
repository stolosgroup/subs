3
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:04,590
<i>Listen up, people!</i>

4
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:07,961
If fingers need to be pointed,

5
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,998
we know where to point them.

6
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:12,966
They use the recovering economy

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,437
and the rising stock market
as their bulletproof vest.

8
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,107
But whose money is it?

9
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,009
- Is it mine?
- No!

10
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:24,044
- Is it yours?
- No!

11
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:26,646
- I can't hear you.
- No!

12
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:31,651
And despite all this wealth
they are hoarding,

13
00:01:31,684 --> 00:01:34,687
they have the gall
to accuse us

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,658
of trying to destroy society
with our policies

15
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:41,661
that promote equal pay
for women.

16
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:45,698
Racial equality for all people.

17
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,834
And health care for everyone.

18
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:52,205
- Well, what do we say?
- Game over!

19
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,674
- Say that again!
- Game over!

20
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:58,011
- Say like you mean it!
- Game over!

21
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:01,882
They label us
"domestic terrorists"

22
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:06,686
when they're the ones
stifling our First Amendment

23
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,058
with ruthless threats
and divisive political warfare.

24
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:20,067
Financial greed and unbridled
power is all they know.

25
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:24,603
Well, now, we have
something to say!

26
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:27,908
- Say it! Say it!
- Say it!

27
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:32,245
If the leaders of
the United States Government

28
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:35,015
won't respect its people...

29
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:40,120
its people
will not respect them!

30
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:44,523
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

31
00:02:48,028 --> 00:02:50,998
Sofia! Sofia! Sofia!

32
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,733
Um, could you...

33
00:03:29,202 --> 00:03:30,904
Never mind.

34
00:03:37,743 --> 00:03:40,579
Ma'am. Sorry about that.

35
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:43,984
- Hope it won't hurt my rating.
- No...

36
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,026
Come on, you cowards!

37
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:34,294
- Come on!
- Shut up!

38
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:37,696
- Everybody, move back!
- Get on out of here!

39
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,765
We want that shitbird spy!

40
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,767
Sir, we can't do that.
Now, please, back up!

41
00:05:43,236 --> 00:05:44,770
Hand the hussy over!

42
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,239
Or we'll feed her and y'all
to T and Rex

43
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:48,441
one piece at a time.

44
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:15,135
- You Robinson's special guy?
- I am.

45
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,837
- Thank goodness you're here.
- You called the local sheriff?

46
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,472
Of course not.

47
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:20,974
Someone must have called it in

48
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:24,211
when I unloaded my revolver
at the crazies.

49
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,946
I panicked.

50
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,789
- What'd you do?
- I didn't do anything.

51
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,237
Based on the fact these crazies
are about to bury you

52
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,006
in a shallow grave,
something happened.

53
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,977
I've been out here
almost two years

54
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,846
playing the part
with these racist bastards,

55
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,982
and it's getting inside my head.

56
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,318
I got sloppy.

57
00:07:05,352 --> 00:07:06,853
They found a few bugs.

58
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,888
Somehow traced it back to me.

59
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:11,558
Stop it,
Special Agent Davidson.

60
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:14,427
I need you to keep your
wits intact.

61
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:16,196
I thought it was your job

62
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,164
to get me out of
this kind of situation.

63
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:21,534
That is correct.
And I'm about to.

64
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,537
Come on, bitch!
Come on out!

65
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:26,172
You ain't pretty enough
to be this stupid.

66
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,208
You're about to eat
some buckshot.

67
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:32,178
Back up before someone
gets hurt!

68
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,935
Which one of you wants
an extra hole in your head?

69
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:31,971
Hey, let's light 'em up,
like a firework!

70
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:58,365
- Bitch.
- Move!

71
00:08:58,398 --> 00:08:59,999
- Move!
- Let's go!

72
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,978
- Stay back!
- Grab the hoses!

73
00:09:19,285 --> 00:09:20,987
Get in the car.

74
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,455
Stay low.

75
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,025
Come on! Come on!

76
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:32,399
Subtle.

77
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,107
Listen, can we
just cut to it?

78
00:09:41,141 --> 00:09:44,477
Are you officially
asking for my help?

79
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:46,212
Because if you are,

80
00:09:46,246 --> 00:09:48,348
I think I have a few solutions.

81
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:53,553
Alright then, I'll handle it.

82
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,388
We'll talk soon.

83
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,492
The President's Chief of Staff
isn't happy

84
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:03,329
with how local PD are handling
the millennial soapbox crowd.

85
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:05,965
Didn't realize
the FBI was charged

86
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,268
with crowd control
at the White House.

87
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:10,170
At least they know who to call

88
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:12,505
when they want
something done right.

89
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,009
You ask me, all these politicos
are chasing their own shadows.

90
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,511
If they wanna last longer
than one term,

91
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,547
they need to smarten up

92
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,717
and understand what got them
elected in the first place.

93
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,386
Fear.

94
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:28,354
When the people are afraid
for their jobs

95
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,323
or their wallets,
or their lives,

96
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:33,092
they want Uncle Sam
to protect them.

97
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:35,328
So if these
politically-correct puppets

98
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,698
wanna straighten out
ornery protesters,

99
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,233
give 'em fear.

100
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,103
Good thing they have you, Gabe.

101
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:49,075
If I've learned anything,
this job's all about

102
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:52,111
finding creative ways
of keeping the peace.

103
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,615
So...

104
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:57,217
Davidson.

105
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,751
She's pretty shaken up.

106
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,386
I dropped her off at a facility.

107
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,755
She's... being cleaned up
and debriefed.

108
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:06,092
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

109
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,094
These deep covers
are like the birds

110
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,497
that keep flying
into these windows.

111
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,532
They wiggle and flop around
a whole lot,

112
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:15,602
but eventually they come back
to their senses.

113
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:17,604
Yeah, most of the time.

114
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:19,372
What a waste.

115
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,208
Lucky we got her out at all.

116
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:24,210
Oh, I wouldn't call it luck.

117
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:27,780
I would call it having an ace
in the hole. You.

118
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:29,215
As always...

119
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,618
I appreciate you making it
happen, Travis.

120
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:52,198
- Hey, princess.
- Grandpa!

121
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,701
- Where'd you go?
- I was checking the perimeter.

122
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:56,736
- All clear?
- All clear.

123
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:58,471
Let's get some cake.

124
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:08,481
- Stay at your place?
- I'd like to try a normal life.

125
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,216
Be in town more.

126
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,919
Be more involved in her world.

127
00:13:11,952 --> 00:13:14,187
Retire?

128
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,522
Is Gabe on board with this plan?

129
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:21,461
Yeah, you haven't even mustered
up the courage to tell him.

130
00:13:21,494 --> 00:13:24,631
It's not that simple.
I'm going to. Soon.

131
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,532
Open it. Open it!

132
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:29,235
- Is that a purse?
- Wow!

133
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,238
Maybe one or two weekends
a month.

134
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,908
The odd weekday,
if we can make that work.

135
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:36,576
You're busy enough
at the hospital.

136
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,245
This way, I could help
take a bit of the load off.

137
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:40,647
And it would be good for her.

138
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,750
- And you know this how?
- She suggested it.

139
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,685
She likes me.

140
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:47,487
And she wants a male figure
in her life

141
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,555
on a, you know,
consistent basis.

142
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,625
Dad, is that a dig
at my love life?

143
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:54,928
Not at all.

144
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,430
Not your fault
that deadbeat ran off.

145
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:02,368
Maybe she does,
but... I'm just not convinced

146
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:05,338
that she needs one who's
borderline certifiable.

147
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,441
It's not that bad.

148
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:11,444
- How many exits?
- Exits?

149
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,346
In this building.
How many exits?

150
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:14,948
What is it? What is it?

151
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,358
She makes rounds...
checking to see

152
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,860
that all the doors in the house
are locked.

153
00:14:26,894 --> 00:14:28,294
Good.

154
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,697
Every hour, on the hour.

155
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,298
Could be hereditary.

156
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,400
Maybe, or she could be
learning it from you.

157
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:35,903
You know,
first it's the locks.

158
00:14:35,936 --> 00:14:38,638
Next it will be the windows,
the gas stove, the electricity,

159
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,673
and before you know it, she's
going to be asking for a Beretta

160
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,308
for her tenth birthday.

161
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,945
That's too young
by a couple of years.

162
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,813
Look, I'm handling it.

163
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,248
It's under control.

164
00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:51,784
And besides,
a little paranoia's healthy.

165
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:54,587
You never know
what nutcases are out there.

166
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,990
I'm just giving her the tools
to protect herself.

167
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,691
That's where you're wrong.

168
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,626
You think that it's all about
protecting her?

169
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,361
In reality,
you might be the one

170
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:04,363
who turns her
into a crazy person.

171
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,234
Three. Or five.

172
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:12,940
Front entrance.
Fire exit on the right.

173
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,908
Loading dock in the back.

174
00:15:14,942 --> 00:15:18,311
Two more, if you count
the windows in the bathrooms.

175
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:23,016
Look, I wasn't a
great husband or father

176
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,284
and I can't unwind that.

177
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:26,753
But if you give me the chance,

178
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:29,388
I'd like to be the best
grandfather I can be.

179
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,392
This for Natalie, or you?

180
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you, gramps. I love it!

181
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,069
You're welcome, sweetie.

182
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:45,839
Oh.

183
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,649
Washington News Cycle.

184
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:14,935
Pass.

185
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,603
- Pass!
- Drew.

186
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:20,974
Yeah, Sofia Flores' death
is a tragedy.

187
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,608
No one's arguing that.

188
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:24,677
But to call out Metro PD
as criminal

189
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,947
for not naming a suspect
or divulging evidence,

190
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,548
that's not news.

191
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:30,117
That's them doing their job.

192
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,818
I've been writing about her
for over a year

193
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,686
because she was the voice
of her generation

194
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,822
spearheading a movement
for real change,

195
00:16:35,856 --> 00:16:38,758
and in return, was mowed down
in a hit-and-run.

196
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,128
There's no reason to believe
it was anything other than

197
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:44,430
wrong time, wrong place,
bad luck.

198
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,099
No. No, no, no, no, no!

199
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:49,402
Oh! God.

200
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:50,904
That's gonna cost me a few quid.

201
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:52,438
The SUV had no plates.

202
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,074
The rideshare driver
was using a fake name.

203
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,876
That's sketchy.

204
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:00,746
Okay, so the SUV
was probably new.

205
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,582
And I don't know,
the rideshare guy

206
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:03,716
was an illegal immigrant
who couldn't use his real name.

207
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:04,952
Who's to say?

208
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,887
If we don't post something
and make it news,

209
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,422
it'll be like it never happened.

210
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,124
That may be true.

211
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,860
What you wrote isn't.

212
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:16,129
Look, I appreciate your
enthusiasm for the movement,

213
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,597
I really do.

214
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,133
But news stories
are based on facts.

215
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,835
Find them first

216
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,436
then write your story.

217
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,983
Hey, buddy,
you can't park here.

218
00:18:10,017 --> 00:18:11,817
Okay.

219
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,854
Yeah, yeah...

220
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,721
I... I'll move it.

221
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,927
Gun! Put your hands up!

222
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,861
Look, I can explain.

223
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:23,897
Show 'em!
Put your hands out the window!

224
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:25,698
Step out of the vehicle.

225
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,602
Put your hands on your head.

226
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:33,840
Do not move.

227
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:08,808
Freeze, asshole!

228
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,748
You keep up
this routine,

229
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,651
there's no way
you're walking out of here.

230
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:26,159
I'm here to help,
but to do that properly,

231
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:29,129
I need more information.

232
00:19:29,162 --> 00:19:31,731
What were you planning on doing?

233
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:40,606
The police found booze, pills
and a handgun in your vehicle.

234
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:45,278
Were you thinking of putting
a round in your brainpan?

235
00:19:45,312 --> 00:19:46,313
No.

236
00:19:46,346 --> 00:19:47,881
Maybe you had a score to settle.

237
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:49,216
Were you there to kill someone?

238
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:50,951
- No.
- Rob a jewelry store?

239
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:52,618
Look, I wasn't gonna do anything
with the gun.

240
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,121
I was keeping it in the car.

241
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:55,288
On the passenger seat?

242
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:57,224
I wasn't thinking straight,
okay?

243
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,558
Are you now?

244
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:07,533
Alright, Dusty. My time's up.

245
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:12,839
You're welcome to stay, or we
can stroll out of here together.

246
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:16,742
But to do that,
you'll need to level with me.

247
00:20:18,145 --> 00:20:20,080
What were you doing?

248
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:28,055
I was going to talk
to a reporter.

249
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,066
Sign here for Dusty Crane.

250
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:43,103
Mike, uh, let's just say
this one was never here, yeah?

251
00:20:47,941 --> 00:20:49,109
Thanks.

252
00:20:54,114 --> 00:20:57,817
- Where to, boss?
- A nice, quiet secure place.

253
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:59,219
Where I get reprogrammed?

254
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:03,123
Where you can screw your
priorities back on straight.

255
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:05,791
And after that they'll assign me
to some small town field office

256
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:06,960
where they can keep an eye on me

257
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:08,727
while my soul slowly dies,
right?

258
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,197
Or you work through this
speed bump

259
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,134
in order to salvage what's left
of your promising career.

260
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,768
I like you, Dusty.

261
00:21:15,801 --> 00:21:17,971
I like your passion. I like your
commitment to the job.

262
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:19,906
But you were on the verge of
making a bad choice.

263
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,842
No, it wasn't a bad choice,
it was the right choice.

264
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,776
Wrong. You took an oath.

265
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:25,711
You need to honor that.

266
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:26,880
Listen, work with me

267
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:28,148
and I'll spin it with Robinson

268
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,648
as best I can.

269
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:30,851
Get you back on track.

270
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:32,252
Oh, you don't get it, Block.

271
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:33,987
It's gone too far.

272
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,788
We're crossing lines that should
never be crossed.

273
00:21:35,821 --> 00:21:37,823
Guys like you and me,
we don't decide

274
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:39,292
where those lines are drawn.

275
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:42,195
The only thing you need to know
is whose orders you follow.

276
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:46,867
Your loyalties lie
on the wrong side of the future.

277
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,136
I don't expect everyone
to cope with the mind games

278
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,204
that come with
deep undercover work.

279
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:53,140
Once you're in it,
it's hard to tell

280
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:56,209
which way is up, down,
right, wrong.

281
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:57,844
But you're an intelligent guy

282
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,980
and I do expect you
to cope with it.

283
00:22:01,948 --> 00:22:03,950
You do whatever you gotta do
to me.

284
00:22:03,984 --> 00:22:06,286
I'm not playing
by the Bureau's rules anymore.

285
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,021
We'll see about that.

286
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,760
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

287
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:25,205
This where my
re-education begins?

288
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,042
Wrist.

289
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:41,488
- Grandpa!
- Hey, sweetie.

290
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:44,291
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

291
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:45,892
I needed that hug.

292
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:48,794
It's okay.
I know you have to work.

293
00:22:48,828 --> 00:22:52,465
Yeah. Um, you here
all by yourself?

294
00:22:52,499 --> 00:22:54,467
Well, not anymore.

295
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:56,069
Ready to go?
It's our night.

296
00:22:56,102 --> 00:22:58,804
But when you didn't
answer your phone,

297
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:02,242
Miss Lewis called mommy
at the hospital.

298
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:06,179
So now I'm supposed to sit tight
and wait for her.

299
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:08,215
Oh, I see.

300
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:11,918
But that doesn't mean
you can't stay here with me.

301
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:17,123
Uh... it certainly doesn't.

302
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:25,198
Hey, kid!

303
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:26,866
Come here.

304
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:29,236
You a criminal?

305
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:32,072
If it's... if it's a crime to
speak the truth, buddy,

306
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:33,340
then, yes, I am.

307
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,210
Uh, hey, no,
I wouldn't do that.

308
00:23:40,347 --> 00:23:43,083
I like those buttons, though.
Can I see one of those?

309
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,784
Looks like a fun picnic.

310
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:46,953
Who are these two?

311
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:49,222
This is me, and that's mommy.

312
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:52,092
Of course, which means
that must be me.

313
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,962
No, you silly bean.
That's a stranger.

314
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,869
What, what's a stranger doing?

315
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,504
Watching us.

316
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:06,106
Watching you? Why?

317
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:07,407
Has someone been watching you?

318
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,842
I don't know.

319
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,877
I need you to know.

320
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:17,117
I'm sorry, Natalie. It's okay.

321
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,419
It's just very important for you
always to be aware,

322
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:20,887
like I've taught you.

323
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,289
But I am.

324
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:24,157
And tell me if anyone

325
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,593
strange comes up to you,
approaches you.

326
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,428
Okay, I will.

327
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:29,963
Good girl. Thank you.

328
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:32,232
Are bad guys gonna hurt you?

329
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:33,967
Hurt me? Nah.

330
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,268
Why would you think that?

331
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:38,138
Because mommy says
your job is dangerous.

332
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:41,374
Don't worry.
She exaggerates.

333
00:24:41,408 --> 00:24:43,109
It's not that dangerous.

334
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:47,047
Nothing's gonna happen to me,
or you.

335
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,149
- Or mommy?
- Or mommy.

336
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,320
Mommy!

337
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:55,955
Hi, sweetie. Grandpa.

338
00:25:09,102 --> 00:25:11,471
Dusty! Don't do this!

339
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,345
I think you have an admirer.

340
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:20,447
Does he live in a castle
and have a heart of gold?

341
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,915
He's on line three.

342
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:23,550
Says your last few articles
on Sofia Flores

343
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,018
were inspirational.

344
00:25:25,051 --> 00:25:26,252
Was Prince Charming
slurring his words?

345
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:27,887
Claims he can guarantee you
a story

346
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:31,091
worthy of a dozen
clickbait headlines.

347
00:25:31,124 --> 00:25:33,226
- Just tell me what it is.
- No.

348
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:35,228
No, it's too dangerous
to do over the phone.

349
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:37,130
They're listening.
They're always listening.

350
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:41,468
I'm gonna come to you,
we'll find some place quiet

351
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,203
to talk about it.

352
00:25:47,407 --> 00:25:49,609
- When?
- How about five minutes?

353
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,536
Move! Move! Get out of the way!

354
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:17,904
No!

355
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,209
- Look out!
- Move!

356
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:39,125
What the hell are you doing?

357
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,027
I'm going to free my conscience!

358
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,129
Watch out!

359
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:34,280
- Get out of the way! Move!
- Hey!

360
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,515
Stop!

361
00:28:00,473 --> 00:28:02,408
No, no, no, no, no!

362
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:56,563
- Are you Mira?
- Yeah, you are?

363
00:28:56,596 --> 00:28:58,565
Being followed.
Let's go somewhere private.

364
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:01,134
Wait! What exactly is this
all about?

365
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,535
Look, this is really important.

366
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:04,370
We're gonna have to do this
another time, okay?

367
00:29:04,404 --> 00:29:05,772
No, wait!

368
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,506
The last person
on the planet

369
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,643
I need talking to the
press is Crane.

370
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:46,412
He should be
in a secure mental facility.

371
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:50,750
Natalie's school?

372
00:29:50,783 --> 00:29:53,219
What the hell were you thinking?

373
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,355
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.

374
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:57,790
Bad timing. Poor judgement.

375
00:29:57,824 --> 00:29:59,492
He say anything to you?

376
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:02,729
He was having a moral code
moment.

377
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:04,464
Said we were crossing the line.

378
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:07,901
Must feel nice to be that naive.

379
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,235
Is that all?

380
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:10,670
Just that he's done following

381
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:11,905
the Bureau's rules,

382
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:15,909
and based on his little
truck stunt...

383
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:17,377
I tend to believe him.

384
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,512
He's a live grenade.

385
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:21,247
This one makes it
to the front page,

386
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,950
I'm gonna catch heat
from every direction.

387
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:25,685
Stupid thing!

388
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:29,522
I haven't properly worn one of
these since Margaret passed.

389
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:32,926
- Yeah, she had a gift.
- That she did.

390
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,361
Bless her soul.

391
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:39,499
Letting Crane slip through your
fingers, not like you.

392
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:43,336
Are you alright?

393
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:45,873
Yeah, I've just been feeling
a bit distracted.

394
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:48,876
Well, no need to
hold it in with me, buddy.

395
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,643
What's the trouble?

396
00:30:50,677 --> 00:30:53,813
I'm trying to spend more time
with Natalie.

397
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:55,849
And?

398
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:59,385
At this point, Amanda doesn't
trust me, for good reason.

399
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:00,954
I need to change that.

400
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:03,189
Anything I can do to help?

401
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:06,994
Actually, Gabe...

402
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:08,962
I've been thinking.

403
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,264
Maybe it's time I hang it up.

404
00:31:11,297 --> 00:31:14,567
No. No, no, no.

405
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,969
Not an option.

406
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,371
The thing is,
it's been over 20 years

407
00:31:18,404 --> 00:31:19,973
of the unpredictable.

408
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,607
Never knowing
when you're gonna call

409
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:24,011
where you're gonna send me
and for how long.

410
00:31:24,044 --> 00:31:26,379
Which has made relationships
difficult.

411
00:31:26,412 --> 00:31:29,582
And now... Natalie needs
stability in her life,

412
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:31,350
and I want to be that for her.

413
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:34,021
I appreciate the importance
of family, God knows.

414
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,588
Look at me.

415
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:40,493
But what you do is crucial,
important work.

416
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,762
Our people
go to dangerous places,

417
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:44,731
physically and mentally.

418
00:31:44,764 --> 00:31:46,466
And when they go astray,

419
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:49,870
I need you to bring them back

420
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:52,238
before they grow horns.

421
00:31:53,573 --> 00:31:56,342
Saving good agents' souls.

422
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,478
Whatever it takes.

423
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:02,615
I'll tell you what.

424
00:32:02,648 --> 00:32:05,818
Once Dusty's in a cell
and I have the key,

425
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:08,488
we'll work out a way
for you to spend more time

426
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:10,991
with your granddaughter.

427
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:12,458
Deal?

428
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:17,965
Out of curiosity,
I pulled our security footage

429
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:19,732
from when I met this guy.

430
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:21,300
Uh, do you have a name?

431
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:22,668
No, but our security guards
recognized him.

432
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:24,370
It's the same guy
who was arrested

433
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,539
for fighting the cops
across the street.

434
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,909
Your fighter's your runner?

435
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:31,444
You've looked better.
Did you sleep at all last night?

436
00:32:31,477 --> 00:32:33,446
Define sleep.

437
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,849
You know you can just
record your stupid games

438
00:32:35,883 --> 00:32:37,750
and watch them later.

439
00:32:37,784 --> 00:32:39,619
That's rather like
jumping to the belly ache

440
00:32:39,652 --> 00:32:41,054
after you've overeaten
without actually

441
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:43,790
enjoying the cake first.

442
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:47,360
I checked every police station
within 50 miles of here.

443
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:50,630
No record of his arrest.

444
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:52,598
This feels like another
Mira special.

445
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,400
You don't find that strange?

446
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:55,802
Maybe they just let him go

447
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:57,670
to avoid another police
brutality charge.

448
00:32:57,703 --> 00:33:00,339
He beat the crap
out of four cops.

449
00:33:03,709 --> 00:33:05,745
Okay. Maybe you're right.

450
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:09,883
So, what's the headline?

451
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:13,921
I didn't say I have a draft,
or even an angle. I just...

452
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:17,690
He contacted me.
He could be a legitimate source.

453
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:19,725
Or a nutcase
wanting to go viral.

454
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:59,565
So... no bank
or credit card activity?

455
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:03,436
Okay, what about
under Dusty's alias?

456
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:06,039
His last known cover was...

457
00:34:06,073 --> 00:34:08,708
Uh-huh. I see.

458
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:11,611
Well, keep an eye on it,
will ya?

459
00:34:11,644 --> 00:34:12,778
Thanks.

460
00:34:29,129 --> 00:34:33,000
<i>No, you silly bean,
that's a stranger...</i>

461
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:40,539
<i>Watching us...</i>

462
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:47,848
- Got him?
- Oh, yeah.

463
00:34:47,881 --> 00:34:48,916
Grandpa!

464
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:51,717
Hey, pumpkin.
Where have you been?

465
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:53,653
At the park,
flying my kite.

466
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:56,489
Oh, that sounds fun.
You get it high up in the air?

467
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:59,759
Not really.
I couldn't run fast enough.

468
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:03,529
- But mommy did.
- Oh, good job, mommy.

469
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,531
Go inside and wash up
for dinner, please.

470
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,633
Can you stay and eat with us?

471
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:10,037
We're having homemade pizza.

472
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,972
Oh, I love pizza.

473
00:35:14,007 --> 00:35:15,708
Pizza it is.

474
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:19,880
That was four times.

475
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:21,882
Four? Are you sure?

476
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:25,518
Oh, go again.
One, two, three.

477
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:30,823
What are you doing?

478
00:35:30,857 --> 00:35:33,226
Ah, installing security cameras.

479
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,828
On my house?

480
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:36,897
For Natalie's safety.
And yours.

481
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,698
I know that I should just say
thank you,

482
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,667
and... some might consider that
very sweet of you,

483
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,236
but you can't do
things like this

484
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,838
without asking my permission.

485
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:46,505
I was concerned
you would say no.

486
00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:47,908
And you'd probably be right.

487
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:50,043
She's drawing pictures
of strangers, watching her.

488
00:35:50,077 --> 00:35:53,612
And what do you think is
feeding her growing paranoia?

489
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:56,984
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

490
00:35:57,017 --> 00:36:00,988
And I admit it. I screwed up
on multiple occasions.

491
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:02,990
But you've got to know,
I'm trying to fix things.

492
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:05,926
Natalie doesn't need a fixer
like you.

493
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:10,163
You sound just like your mother.

494
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:12,598
Before or after she left us?

495
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:19,638
I'm worried about you, dad.

496
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:21,174
There's nothing to worry about.

497
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:22,675
That's why I'm worried.

498
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:23,977
Because maybe you can't see it,

499
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:27,280
but you're not the same dad
that I remember.

500
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:28,581
You know,
when I was Natalie's age,

501
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:29,916
your quirks were cute.

502
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,152
Getting my bicycle serviced
every few months.

503
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:34,754
Waking up at 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.
to make sure all the doors

504
00:36:34,787 --> 00:36:36,156
and windows were still locked,

505
00:36:36,189 --> 00:36:39,292
and getting background checks
on my friends' parents.

506
00:36:39,326 --> 00:36:41,761
Your quirks
aren't quirks anymore.

507
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:45,966
You need to accept that
and you need to deal with it.

508
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,633
I sometimes wonder

509
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,735
did the disorder change you

510
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,972
or was it your dirty job?

511
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:58,011
Finish with the cameras.

512
00:36:58,045 --> 00:37:00,914
So please don't do anything else
without asking first.

513
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,629
Can I get
either of you gentlemen

514
00:37:16,662 --> 00:37:18,098
something to drink?

515
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:21,734
No thank you, ma'am.

516
00:37:27,174 --> 00:37:29,176
Special Agent Lockhart.

517
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:30,844
Special Agent Wallace.

518
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:32,345
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.

519
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:34,114
Come in.

520
00:37:59,738 --> 00:38:01,208
Don't let baggy pants
get to you.

521
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:04,643
I just can't believe Sarah falls
for his blatant ass-kissing.

522
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:06,279
She's too smart for that.

523
00:38:06,313 --> 00:38:08,915
My take is, she enjoys it.

524
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:11,017
Found this on the police wire.

525
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:13,987
- Is that your guy?
- I think it is.

526
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:21,394
Not exactly a dream date.
But he is kinda hot.

527
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:23,130
Wanted by
the DC Police Department.

528
00:38:23,163 --> 00:38:26,032
Considered armed
and mentally unstable.

529
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,835
Hm, I wonder if I should be
curious or scared

530
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,170
about what he wanted to tell me.

531
00:38:30,203 --> 00:38:32,172
Probably both.

532
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,642
"Possession."

533
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:41,248
"Disturbing the peace.

534
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:43,216
Assault with a deadly weapon."

535
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:51,790
Shh! Shh! Shh!

536
00:38:57,898 --> 00:38:59,732
Mira Jones?

537
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:01,968
Maybe.

538
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:04,938
I have information
about your story.

539
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:07,073
The one that ran away.

540
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:15,748
- You have a name, Agent?
- I'm not an agent.

541
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:18,285
This isn't an interview.
Please, turn it off.

542
00:39:19,986 --> 00:39:22,755
- Who is he?
- You tell me.

543
00:39:22,788 --> 00:39:26,326
- Why were you meeting him?
- Why did you chase him away?

544
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,694
Has he contacted you again?

545
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,365
Listen.

546
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:34,501
He's wanted on multiple counts.

547
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:36,136
If you know where he is,

548
00:39:36,169 --> 00:39:38,071
you're an accessory
after the fact.

549
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:41,074
Oh, well, thank you for
stopping by and informing me.

550
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:45,078
I think Little Man's finished,
Mr. Not-An-Agent.

551
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:48,215
The man needs professional help.
He's unbalanced.

552
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:51,985
Yeah, I read all about
our friend Dusty's problems.

553
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,487
Guess you don't
have a subscription

554
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,156
to the police wire.

555
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,823
He's on the police wire?

556
00:39:57,857 --> 00:39:59,459
Are we done?

557
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:01,828
I think we're done.

558
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,964
I don't know
what his intentions were

559
00:40:03,997 --> 00:40:06,233
or why he made contact with you.

560
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:08,101
But let me be clear.

561
00:40:08,134 --> 00:40:11,137
He's not a source for you to
make your fledgling career on.

562
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,007
- Let it go.
- Okay, this is intimidation.

563
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,244
And you know nothing about me
or my fledgling career.

564
00:40:17,277 --> 00:40:20,280
Name "James Van Dorn"
mean anything to you?

565
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:24,517
No.

566
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:28,121
Mr. Van Dorn and his wife lived
in a comfortable six-bedroom

567
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:31,224
brownstone across
from Montrose Park.

568
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:33,526
Plenty of room for them
and their three kids.

569
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,262
But that wasn't enough for him.

570
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:37,464
He also had a thing
for his secretary.

571
00:40:37,497 --> 00:40:41,368
He made a mistake, had a
daughter, whom he disowned.

572
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:45,438
She's... probably about 30 now.

573
00:40:45,472 --> 00:40:46,840
A struggling journalist

574
00:40:46,873 --> 00:40:49,142
who lives in a
shoebox-sized apartment

575
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:51,011
and writes under a pseudonym

576
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:54,914
because her father demanded
she spare him the embarrassment.

577
00:40:54,948 --> 00:40:56,149
Get out of my way.

578
00:40:56,182 --> 00:40:59,052
Quoting a source who isn't sane

579
00:40:59,085 --> 00:41:02,989
could get you sued
for libel or fired.

580
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:06,393
Although, in this case,
I'd say both are probable.

581
00:41:06,426 --> 00:41:07,594
There's no story here.

582
00:41:07,627 --> 00:41:09,329
- Says who?
- Says me.

583
00:41:10,897 --> 00:41:13,033
Okay.

584
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:14,200
Thanks.

585
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:18,271
For confirming that
there is a story. Goodnight.

586
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,244
He contacts you, you contact me.
Got it?

587
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:28,615
Take my word for it.
Don't play news hero.

588
00:41:28,648 --> 00:41:30,216
Don't.

589
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:00,213
Dusty, we don't want trouble.

590
00:42:00,246 --> 00:42:01,114
Too late.

591
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:02,615
Robinson just wants to talk.

592
00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:06,519
Let us take you to him. You two
can work out your differences.

593
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:07,587
Good plan.

594
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:11,117
The FBI shows up at my
door and tries to intimidate me

595
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:15,155
because this mentally unstable
guy contacted me?

596
00:43:15,188 --> 00:43:16,990
Maybe he's not
so crazy after all.

597
00:43:17,023 --> 00:43:18,324
You sure he's a Fed?

598
00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:22,262
The whole thing smells
a tad unusual.

599
00:43:23,129 --> 00:43:25,432
Do you... do you want me
to check it out?

600
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:27,567
No, I got it.

601
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,402
Okay.

602
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:31,738
But you might want to start
adding some actual detail

603
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:33,173
because right now,
the only story

604
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:35,508
you're writing is in your head.

605
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:38,278
Are you implying that
I'm the crazy one?

606
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:43,183
No. You're the eager one.

607
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:46,052
Listen, if there is a story
to be found here,

608
00:43:46,085 --> 00:43:47,454
you'll need to take note
of the obvious

609
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:50,557
and then scrutinize what the
obvious obscures

610
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,158
like an ultra-violet light

611
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:55,195
illuminating what the
naked eye can't see.

612
00:43:55,228 --> 00:44:00,233
But if you do find something,
tread lightly.

613
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,501
You've got a call.

614
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:03,203
Just a minute.

615
00:44:03,236 --> 00:44:04,737
It's your secret admirer.

616
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,975
This is Mira.

617
00:45:06,165 --> 00:45:09,168
Government,
even in its best state,

618
00:45:09,202 --> 00:45:12,672
is but a necessary evil.

619
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:17,243
In its worst state,
it's an intolerable evil.

620
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:19,312
Now you might think
these words were said

621
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:22,515
last night on a podcast
or a news program

622
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:26,486
about today's state of
the world, but you'd be wrong.

623
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:31,591
Those words were written by
Thomas Paine in 1776.

624
00:45:53,613 --> 00:45:55,815
Move! Go, go, go!

625
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:57,550
Hey!

626
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,300
We got him.

627
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:16,202
Sir, you need to slow down.

628
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:17,604
I promise you,
this is a bad idea.

629
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,642
Enough, Dusty!

630
00:47:06,419 --> 00:47:09,188
- Time to come in.
- Just like that?

631
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:10,623
After you sent those two
shitheads to kill me?

632
00:47:10,657 --> 00:47:13,593
What? I didn't send anyone
to do anything to you.

633
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:19,632
What shitheads?

634
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,669
You can't bullshit me!

635
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,959
You're slipping.

636
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:47,961
You're losing your edge.

637
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:50,229
It's not too late.

638
00:47:50,263 --> 00:47:52,732
I can help you come back with
dignity. Get your life back.

639
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:54,534
I'm done with that life.

640
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,302
You can't run far enough.

641
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:59,439
They'll find you,
cut you off at the knees.

642
00:47:59,472 --> 00:48:00,908
Whatever you're
telling this journalist,

643
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,375
they'll call it treason.

644
00:48:02,408 --> 00:48:04,444
- That's 30 to life.
- I can live with that.

645
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:07,547
No. You're not
thinking straight.

646
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,450
It was all part of the job.
You just got in too deep.

647
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:11,751
Well, deep enough
to see the truth.

648
00:48:11,784 --> 00:48:13,419
We're killing
innocent civilians.

649
00:48:13,453 --> 00:48:15,588
People that are
trying to make a difference!

650
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:17,824
- Who's we?
- The Bureau.

651
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:19,893
And you know this how?

652
00:48:22,762 --> 00:48:25,431
Because I was one of the agents
ordered to do the killing.

653
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:30,236
Innocent civilians?
Under whose orders?

654
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:33,473
Robinson's.

655
00:48:33,506 --> 00:48:35,608
That's a serious accusation.

656
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:39,479
I'm going to prove it.

657
00:48:39,512 --> 00:48:41,614
Listen, I wanna hear
all about it.

658
00:48:41,647 --> 00:48:43,316
Dusty. Dusty!

659
00:48:47,653 --> 00:48:48,654
Ah!

660
00:49:25,893 --> 00:49:27,794
What just happened?

661
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:31,932
Do you know who those men were?

662
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:33,934
No, do... do you?

663
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:35,068
What did Dusty say to you?

664
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:37,838
Uh, he... he was bringing...

665
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:40,573
Bringing you what?
What was he bringing you?

666
00:49:41,574 --> 00:49:43,676
This is all my fault.

667
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:46,880
Mira, look at me.
Tell me what it was.

668
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:49,917
Documents.

669
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:51,051
What kind of documents?

670
00:49:51,084 --> 00:49:52,585
His orders.

671
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:55,588
Proof.

672
00:50:38,664 --> 00:50:40,499
Something on your mind?

673
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:45,571
It's a sad day, no doubt.

674
00:50:45,605 --> 00:50:47,174
Well, let's be honest.

675
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:49,609
The kid had a few
too many loose screws.

676
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:52,478
Or he had a bright future,
until something...

677
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:57,483
or someone
pushed him too far.

678
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,855
Still don't know
who those two men were?

679
00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:05,458
No. At this point,
we still don't know.

680
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:09,196
He was one of the good guys.

681
00:51:09,229 --> 00:51:11,031
He didn't deserve
to die like that.

682
00:51:11,064 --> 00:51:15,202
Well, unfortunately for him,
you got distracted.

683
00:51:15,235 --> 00:51:17,204
If you'd done your job,

684
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:19,405
we wouldn't be wearing
these suits today.

685
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:22,876
It's tragic,
but now it's finished.

686
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,645
Let's point our focus back
where it needs to be.

687
00:51:26,947 --> 00:51:28,949
Plenty more souls to save.

688
00:51:30,884 --> 00:51:32,451
Yeah.

689
00:51:47,834 --> 00:51:50,070
What are you watching, grandpa?

690
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:52,638
Oh, nothing, sweetie.

691
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:55,808
Hey, you and Lambie
should be in bed.

692
00:51:55,842 --> 00:51:58,045
I can't sleep.

693
00:51:58,078 --> 00:52:00,446
Uh-huh? Come here.

694
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:03,250
Attagirl.

695
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:05,551
Thinking about your big play?

696
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:06,819
Everything okay?

697
00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:09,722
I think I'm worried about you.

698
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:12,792
Me? You sound like your mother.

699
00:52:12,826 --> 00:52:14,527
There's nothing to worry about.

700
00:52:18,031 --> 00:52:20,233
Well...

701
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:23,736
You know...
some people live

702
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:26,840
their entire lives thinking
they're doing the right thing...

703
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:33,080
even if it means doing
whatever is proper...

704
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,950
to make sure the good guys
always win.

705
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:42,856
But then, one day
you wake up and realize...

706
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:45,859
you're not sure who the
good guys are anymore.

707
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,829
Which makes you wonder...

708
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:52,833
have I been doing
the right thing?

709
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,002
Am I a good guy?

710
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:57,570
Grandpa?

711
00:52:58,305 --> 00:53:00,573
Are you a good guy?

712
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:06,712
I wanna be.

713
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:30,669
You're not doing anywhere
worthwhile here.

714
00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:33,306
Go home.

715
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,075
Take a couple of days.

716
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:37,643
Mira.

717
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,781
Home. Go.

718
00:53:47,787 --> 00:53:49,923
- Mira.
- Oh, hey.

719
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:53,060
Are... are you following me?

720
00:53:53,093 --> 00:53:54,194
No.

721
00:53:54,227 --> 00:53:56,662
But I did wanna come see you.

722
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,564
How're you holding up?

723
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:01,902
- Not so good.
- Yeah.

724
00:54:03,669 --> 00:54:05,972
You, uh, you like whiskey?

725
00:54:08,275 --> 00:54:10,676
This everything Dusty told you?

726
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:11,978
That's it.

727
00:54:12,946 --> 00:54:15,815
What's this "Operation U?"

728
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:17,683
Unity. Operation Unity.

729
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:20,053
Did he say what its mission is?

730
00:54:28,228 --> 00:54:29,963
These are picked up.

731
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:34,234
Are you being followed?

732
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:35,801
Maybe.

733
00:54:38,872 --> 00:54:42,708
Long story short, he was a
deep cover agent in Miami.

734
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:45,946
Got sniffy with the cocaine
he was tracking.

735
00:54:45,979 --> 00:54:48,348
When I found him, he was
in the Everglades,

736
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:51,017
wrestling an alligator
for sport.

737
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:53,719
Interesting friend.

738
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,721
Not a friend. Debtor.

739
00:54:55,754 --> 00:54:57,991
- For?
- Saving his life.

740
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,760
How long you been doing that?

741
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:05,664
Oh, probably too long.

742
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:17,676
What's with the three thing?

743
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:22,883
I have thoughts looping inside
my head, repeating themselves.

744
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:24,851
If I do something three times,

745
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:27,254
I can usually
suppress the thought.

746
00:55:27,287 --> 00:55:28,821
Obsessive compulsive.

747
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:33,726
Sometimes the obsessing makes me
better at what I do.

748
00:55:33,759 --> 00:55:36,163
Other times...

749
00:55:36,196 --> 00:55:39,199
Other times, I feel like I
should be locked away.

750
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,937
What happened to you?

751
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:50,776
I... screwed up.

752
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:55,681
I served one tour in Vietnam.
I wasn't even 20.

753
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:59,752
April 1975.

754
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:00,954
It was the night before
we pulled out

755
00:56:00,987 --> 00:56:02,821
all our troops and went home.

756
00:56:04,424 --> 00:56:06,725
I was on patrol duty
with Robinson...

757
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:08,028
Director of the FBI?

758
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:11,064
The younger version, yes.

759
00:56:11,097 --> 00:56:14,800
We were talking about everything
we would do when we got home.

760
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,802
Then we turned a corner
into a dark alley,

761
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:20,473
and there was this man
about to...

762
00:56:20,507 --> 00:56:23,043
rape a local woman.

763
00:56:23,076 --> 00:56:25,045
It was hard to see,
but it was obvious

764
00:56:25,078 --> 00:56:27,214
he was roughing her up
pretty bad.

765
00:56:28,814 --> 00:56:30,951
I called out,
and he turned towards us

766
00:56:30,984 --> 00:56:32,986
with what I thought was a gun.

767
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:36,990
So... I shot him.

768
00:56:38,124 --> 00:56:39,259
Kill him?

769
00:56:40,393 --> 00:56:41,962
Yeah.

770
00:56:41,995 --> 00:56:43,930
Then what happened?

771
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:45,465
The woman ran off.

772
00:56:45,498 --> 00:56:47,167
Robinson and I
went up to the guy.

773
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,270
He was face down in a
puddle of his own blood.

774
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:54,274
The gun was a bottle of whiskey.

775
00:56:54,307 --> 00:56:56,276
Robinson flipped him over.

776
00:56:59,145 --> 00:57:02,015
He was our Commanding Officer.

777
00:57:02,048 --> 00:57:04,351
I panicked.
Robinson didn't.

778
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:06,819
I can still hear his voice
like it was that night.

779
00:57:06,853 --> 00:57:08,754
"Walk away. Walk away."

780
00:57:10,156 --> 00:57:11,824
So I did.

781
00:57:11,858 --> 00:57:14,961
Robinson joined the FBI,
we lost touch.

782
00:57:14,995 --> 00:57:18,898
Then about 15 years went by,
and the phone rang.

783
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:20,467
He'd just been promoted.

784
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,272
Asked if I would work directly
for him, off the books.

785
00:57:25,305 --> 00:57:28,008
Said it was his job
to protect the Bureau

786
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:30,010
and mine to protect its agents.

787
00:57:30,043 --> 00:57:31,378
Off the books,
that gives him

788
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,413
plausible deniability for
anything you did.

789
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:39,119
In hindsight, I suspect
I made a poor career choice.

790
00:57:39,152 --> 00:57:41,354
When you take orders for a
living, trying to support

791
00:57:41,388 --> 00:57:45,992
a family, you learn not to
question those orders...

792
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:47,994
regardless of the
moral implications

793
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:51,931
or how they may affect
other people's lives.

794
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,403
So, other than
intimidating journalists,

795
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:58,305
what other kind of
bad stuff do you do?

796
00:57:58,338 --> 00:58:01,308
You name it,
I've probably done it.

797
00:58:01,341 --> 00:58:03,076
Like?

798
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:05,145
Breaking and entering,
extortion.

799
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:08,048
Occasional physical coercion.

800
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:09,916
Murder?

801
00:58:09,949 --> 00:58:13,186
That's not on my menu.

802
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:20,460
And for the record, I changed
my name not for my father

803
00:58:20,493 --> 00:58:23,897
and his family, but out
of respect for my mother.

804
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,632
He fired her three months
after I was born.

805
00:58:25,665 --> 00:58:27,167
She raised me all on her own

806
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,337
and never once asked him
for anything.

807
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,273
When I was old enough,
I changed my name to hers.

808
00:58:33,306 --> 00:58:35,342
I stand corrected.

809
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:40,613
So, Mr. Block... what now?

810
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:54,427
Where did you come from?

811
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:56,496
What's Operation Unity?

812
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:59,232
It's nothing that concerns you.

813
00:58:59,265 --> 00:59:01,935
You know, I've always
respected my position

814
00:59:01,968 --> 00:59:06,206
in our arrangement...
but in this case,

815
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,209
I prefer to be the one
who decides what concerns me.

816
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,946
Unity. The truth, Gabe.

817
00:59:12,979 --> 00:59:15,081
It's not your place to know.

818
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:18,251
Or even ask.

819
00:59:18,284 --> 00:59:21,354
So Dusty was right. You are
killing innocent people.

820
00:59:21,388 --> 00:59:24,991
You're running your own
secret program, Operation Unity.

821
00:59:25,024 --> 00:59:27,894
And when Dusty tried to go
public with it...

822
00:59:29,362 --> 00:59:30,897
you had him killed.

823
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:37,170
Oh, please.

824
00:59:38,505 --> 00:59:41,341
We are not having this
conversation.

825
00:59:41,374 --> 00:59:43,042
Oh, yes, we are.

826
00:59:43,076 --> 00:59:44,344
You need to come clean, Gabe.

827
00:59:44,377 --> 00:59:47,280
You're confused about
our relationship.

828
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:51,017
You work for me.
You are my weapon.

829
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:54,053
After all these years,
that's all I am to you?

830
00:59:54,654 --> 00:59:56,022
Jesus.

831
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:58,658
Oh, you have a
short memory, Travis.

832
00:59:58,691 --> 01:00:03,029
It was me who plucked you
from your aimless life

833
01:00:03,062 --> 01:00:05,432
and turned you
into something special.

834
01:00:05,465 --> 01:00:08,168
But don't forget, I also have a
detailed record

835
01:00:08,201 --> 01:00:10,537
of every law you've ever broken.

836
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,206
Everything I did was for you!

837
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:16,543
I would suggest you show me
a little gratitude

838
01:00:16,576 --> 01:00:19,579
if you and your granddaughter
want anything

839
01:00:19,612 --> 01:00:22,015
that resembles a normal life.

840
01:00:22,048 --> 01:00:23,183
Count me out, Gabriel.

841
01:00:23,216 --> 01:00:25,552
Oh, no, no, Travis.

842
01:00:25,585 --> 01:00:26,753
There is no out for you.

843
01:00:29,222 --> 01:00:31,524
We are in this to the end.

844
01:00:31,558 --> 01:00:32,759
When does it end?

845
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:34,994
When I say it does.

846
01:00:35,028 --> 01:00:39,265
No. My end is now. Right now.

847
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:49,042
Good boy, Little Man. Stay.

848
01:00:50,376 --> 01:00:51,511
Stay.

849
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:55,482
Stay... Uh-uh! Stay.

850
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:58,451
Okay, get it.

851
01:01:00,687 --> 01:01:02,222
Hey, Pearl, what's news?

852
01:01:02,255 --> 01:01:04,123
Your story's
getting some play.

853
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:07,327
What do you mean?
I didn't write it.

854
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,496
Ah, check the site.

855
01:01:19,539 --> 01:01:23,209
Needs a bit of polish, but your
word choices are delightful.

856
01:01:23,243 --> 01:01:24,811
Who knew that "dollop"
could be a verb?

857
01:01:24,845 --> 01:01:26,446
- I know. I was just...
- Go!

858
01:01:26,479 --> 01:01:27,780
- I was just in the middle of...
- Go!

859
01:01:27,814 --> 01:01:30,283
- Mira.
- That was my lead.

860
01:01:30,316 --> 01:01:31,651
You've been comatose
and I didn't want

861
01:01:31,684 --> 01:01:33,620
the story to get
scooped up by another outlet.

862
01:01:33,653 --> 01:01:35,121
That's horseshit.

863
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:36,789
You sent me home
so you could steal my story.

864
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,225
I did not.

865
01:01:39,259 --> 01:01:41,127
And besides,
you're too close to it.

866
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,262
Too close?

867
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:43,263
The only thing I'm too close to

868
01:01:43,296 --> 01:01:45,131
is punching you in the face.

869
01:01:45,164 --> 01:01:46,132
Please don't.

870
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:48,101
Stay away from my story.

871
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:50,670
Whatever.

872
01:01:50,703 --> 01:01:52,805
There's no real facts.

873
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,607
It's hardly even a story.

874
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:59,312
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

875
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:08,521
What do you mean,
she's not coming over?

876
01:02:08,555 --> 01:02:10,423
I'm making dinner
for her right now.

877
01:02:10,456 --> 01:02:12,358
Do you even
know what today was?

878
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:15,628
What was today?

879
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:18,431
Her school play
that you promised you'd come to.

880
01:02:18,464 --> 01:02:19,666
Shit.

881
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:21,501
I'm not so sure that I
should let her stay with you

882
01:02:21,534 --> 01:02:23,169
when you're not even
responsible enough

883
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:25,171
to show up for the easy stuff.

884
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,640
I've... I've had a lot of things
on my mind.

885
01:02:27,674 --> 01:02:29,475
But apparently, Natalie
wasn't one of them.

886
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,581
Okay, I... I deserve that.

887
01:02:34,614 --> 01:02:36,282
Yeah. You do.

888
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,886
I'm... I'm coming over.

889
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:40,854
No.

890
01:02:40,888 --> 01:02:42,589
I want to apologize to her
personally.

891
01:02:42,622 --> 01:02:44,324
No, you and
your paranoia

892
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:46,159
can't get
out of your own way.

893
01:02:46,192 --> 01:02:47,327
I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an

894
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,595
insecure, screwed up kid.

895
01:02:48,628 --> 01:02:50,763
You need to take care
of yourself, dad.

896
01:02:50,797 --> 01:02:52,632
Wait, Amanda. Amanda!

897
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,439
<i>I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an...</i>

898
01:02:59,472 --> 01:03:01,441
<i>I'm not having you turn Natalie
into an insecure...</i>

899
01:03:01,474 --> 01:03:02,775
<i>I'm not having you turn
Natalie into an</i>

900
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:05,111
<i>insecure, screwed up kid.</i>

901
01:03:36,476 --> 01:03:37,878
Hey, you've reached Mira.

902
01:03:37,911 --> 01:03:39,445
You know what to do.

903
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:43,549
Hi, Mira, it's me, Drew.
Just leaving the office now.

904
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:46,719
Just wanted to say I'm a shit
for jumping your story.

905
01:03:48,521 --> 01:03:49,689
Hope you're feeling better.

906
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:55,261
Um, I've got to go.

907
01:04:28,494 --> 01:04:30,263
You can't be serious.

908
01:05:04,464 --> 01:05:06,299
911,
what's your emergency?

909
01:05:06,332 --> 01:05:08,869
Yeah, I'm being chased
on the I-66.

910
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:12,371
Oh, come on, really?

911
01:05:24,852 --> 01:05:26,252
Come on!

912
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:07,760
You okay, Drew?

913
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:10,329
I don't... don't know.

914
01:06:35,721 --> 01:06:37,423
Just wanted to
say I'm a shit

915
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:39,392
for jumping your story.

916
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:40,861
Hope you're feeling better.

917
01:06:41,794 --> 01:06:42,896
Ah, I've got to go.

918
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,665
See what I mean?
You can hear it in his voice.

919
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:48,701
- Something happened.
- Yeah.

920
01:06:48,734 --> 01:06:53,573
No, I hear you and see the dots
you're connecting, and, yes,

921
01:06:53,606 --> 01:06:57,610
that conclusion makes a lot of
sense right now, but...

922
01:06:57,643 --> 01:07:00,080
suggesting that the head of the
FBI had Drew killed

923
01:07:00,113 --> 01:07:02,115
because he printed a story?

924
01:07:02,149 --> 01:07:04,717
- Sounds crazy, right?
- Right.

925
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:05,986
Yeah.

926
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:10,157
Listen, honey, we're all
heartbroken, okay?

927
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,860
But the reality is, this is
probably just a bad accident,

928
01:07:12,893 --> 01:07:15,829
or road rage or I... I don't know
whatever it might have been.

929
01:07:15,863 --> 01:07:18,731
But honestly, at this point,
sitting here playing detective,

930
01:07:18,764 --> 01:07:21,500
it is not going to
solve anything

931
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:24,437
including a conspiracy theory.

932
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,681
Operation Unity.
That's what Dusty called it.

933
01:07:35,715 --> 01:07:37,117
That could mean anything.

934
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:38,751
Dusty said that the FBI was

935
01:07:38,784 --> 01:07:40,988
crossing the line,
killing innocent civilians.

936
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:42,488
His words.

937
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:43,857
And that he was coming to me
with his story

938
01:07:43,891 --> 01:07:47,895
because of my articles
about Sofia Flores.

939
01:07:47,928 --> 01:07:48,794
I'm not following.

940
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,663
Sofia Flores was an
innocent civilian

941
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:53,532
killed in an accidental
hit-and-run, unless...

942
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:57,536
unless it wasn't an accident.

943
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:00,773
So you think she was murdered
by the FBI

944
01:08:00,806 --> 01:08:02,976
and that is what crossed
Dusty's line?

945
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,777
Maybe.

946
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,679
If what
you're saying is true,

947
01:08:06,712 --> 01:08:08,748
with the way the world
is right now,

948
01:08:08,781 --> 01:08:11,151
this could wipe out the
FBI's highest ranks.

949
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:13,619
As it should.

950
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:16,990
You do realize
if your dots are correct

951
01:08:17,024 --> 01:08:21,028
and we play this wrong,
we could both end up like Sofia.

952
01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:23,629
And Dusty. And maybe Drew.

953
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:27,834
Still wanna pursue it?

954
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:36,776
We're sorry.

955
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:39,179
The number you have reached
is not in service.

956
01:08:39,212 --> 01:08:40,513
Please check the...

957
01:08:42,682 --> 01:08:45,252
We're sorry. The number you have
reached is not in service.

958
01:08:45,285 --> 01:08:46,752
Sorry... Not in service...

959
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:48,889
Please check the number
or try again.

960
01:08:48,922 --> 01:08:50,090
The number... Try again.

961
01:09:10,243 --> 01:09:11,811
I'm sorry, Mr. Block,

962
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:13,914
but your granddaughter no longer
goes to school here.

963
01:09:13,947 --> 01:09:15,248
Since when?

964
01:09:15,282 --> 01:09:16,816
A few days ago.

965
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:19,252
Did her mother say
where they were moving?

966
01:09:19,286 --> 01:09:20,954
- No.
- But her school records...

967
01:09:20,988 --> 01:09:22,655
They had to be
forwarded somewhere.

968
01:09:22,688 --> 01:09:23,857
No, no one asked.

969
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:25,691
I'm not sure what happened.

970
01:09:25,725 --> 01:09:28,028
I mean, usually we're given
plenty of notice...

971
01:09:30,297 --> 01:09:32,065
When did Amanda
quit the hospital?

972
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:34,935
<i>Amanda quit the hospital.
Amanda quit the hospital.</i>

973
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:38,704
<i>No, no, no, everything's fine.</i>

974
01:09:38,738 --> 01:09:40,639
<i>Everything's fine.
Everything's fine.</i>

975
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:41,908
When did you last hear
from Natalie?

976
01:09:41,942 --> 01:09:43,143
<i>Natalie. Natalie.</i>

977
01:09:43,176 --> 01:09:44,577
<i>Natalie. No, no.</i>

978
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:45,979
<i>Amanda. Amanda. Amanda.</i>

979
01:09:46,013 --> 01:09:47,881
<i>When did my daughter
quit the hospital?</i>

980
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:50,150
<i>Amanda. Amanda. When did
you last hear from Natalie?</i>

981
01:09:50,183 --> 01:09:52,019
Any idea where they might be?

982
01:09:52,052 --> 01:09:54,653
<i>Any idea
where they might be?</i>

983
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:56,789
<i>So, no idea
where they might be.</i>

984
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:01,294
If fingers
need to be pointed,

985
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:03,130
we know where to point them.

986
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:50,210
Who is it?

987
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:52,345
- It's me.
- Oh, God!

988
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:54,948
It's okay, it's just Pearl.

989
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:58,351
Thought I'd cheer you up.

990
01:10:58,385 --> 01:10:59,718
Dinner?

991
01:11:02,255 --> 01:11:03,823
What am I looking at?

992
01:11:03,857 --> 01:11:06,326
Dusty Crane's rap sheet
I pulled off the police wire.

993
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:07,894
And?

994
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:10,696
Now we know he was an
undercover Federal agent,

995
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:11,730
so this shouldn't
have been in the

996
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:13,100
National Crime's main system.

997
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:15,668
To protect his identity.

998
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:17,838
- Which means it's fake.
- It's fake.

999
01:11:17,871 --> 01:11:20,073
The only reason to do that would
be to spread misinformation

1000
01:11:20,107 --> 01:11:22,741
in order to discredit him
as a potential source.

1001
01:11:23,977 --> 01:11:27,147
So someone like me
doesn't write his story.

1002
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,850
Okay, I could buy that.

1003
01:11:29,883 --> 01:11:31,151
But who?

1004
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:37,290
- Travis.
- What did you do?

1005
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:38,824
Senses return?

1006
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:40,726
You ready to get back
in the saddle?

1007
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:42,695
Where's my family?

1008
01:11:42,728 --> 01:11:43,830
How the hell would I know?

1009
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,198
If I find out you had anything

1010
01:11:45,232 --> 01:11:48,435
to do with Amanda and my
granddaughter disappearing,

1011
01:11:48,468 --> 01:11:50,137
you're gonna need more men.

1012
01:11:53,106 --> 01:11:55,909
I don't have a clue what
you're going on about.

1013
01:11:56,843 --> 01:11:58,145
Now I know you've got a lot

1014
01:11:58,178 --> 01:12:00,746
swirling around that
skull of yours,

1015
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:03,083
but it doesn't have
to be this way.

1016
01:12:03,116 --> 01:12:06,987
We always had
each other's back, remember?

1017
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:11,024
Now, let's go to the office
and talk about saving souls.

1018
01:12:11,057 --> 01:12:15,862
I've told you before.
No. It's over.

1019
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,430
That's your decision.

1020
01:12:17,464 --> 01:12:20,799
That's the wrong decision,
but yours.

1021
01:12:22,369 --> 01:12:23,904
Excuse me.

1022
01:12:28,807 --> 01:12:31,478
Last chance. Where are they?

1023
01:12:31,511 --> 01:12:33,146
We're the FBI.

1024
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:37,050
We don't involve ourselves
in petty domestic disputes.

1025
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,886
He touches the car again,
shoot him.

1026
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:47,928
The great J. Edgar Hoover once
said, in a public forum no less,

1027
01:12:47,961 --> 01:12:51,031
that the purpose of
counter-intelligence action

1028
01:12:51,064 --> 01:12:55,902
is to disrupt and it is
immaterial whether facts exist

1029
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:58,071
to substantiate the charge.

1030
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:03,977
If I were to say that in
public today, I can just imagine

1031
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:07,948
the media backlash that would
wash me out of this office.

1032
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:09,482
- It wouldn't be pretty, sir.
- No.

1033
01:13:09,516 --> 01:13:13,887
Nowadays, this country is ruled
by gotcha moments on Twitter.

1034
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,289
But that doesn't mean
it's still not the truth.

1035
01:13:16,323 --> 01:13:21,061
Hoover had COINTELPRO,
and I have Operation Unity.

1036
01:13:21,094 --> 01:13:24,097
And as unpopular as
what we do may sound,

1037
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:27,367
History tells us that
spilling a little blood

1038
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:31,438
is absolutely necessary
to maintain law and order.

1039
01:13:31,471 --> 01:13:36,076
Now, either Crane didn't
understand that, or didn't care.

1040
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:40,046
And now look at the mess
he's making me clean up.

1041
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,384
What's worse is, he's infected
someone... dear to me.

1042
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:45,518
Block.

1043
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:47,954
Been a good friend, family,

1044
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,123
for as long as I can remember.

1045
01:13:50,156 --> 01:13:52,892
Sir, I may be
out of line here, but...

1046
01:13:55,228 --> 01:13:57,197
would you like us
to have a word with him?

1047
01:13:58,932 --> 01:14:02,002
Someone in the FBI created
a false criminal record

1048
01:14:02,035 --> 01:14:05,338
for a Federal agent involved in
a secret FBI program.

1049
01:14:05,372 --> 01:14:08,241
That fake record was then sent
out on the police wire

1050
01:14:08,275 --> 01:14:10,877
so that the media
would ignore him.

1051
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,545
Drew obviously didn't.

1052
01:14:12,579 --> 01:14:15,415
And now that agent
and Drew are both dead.

1053
01:14:15,448 --> 01:14:16,950
Interesting.

1054
01:14:18,451 --> 01:14:20,186
Almost.

1055
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,922
We run that, and tomorrow we get
a simple, logical explanation.

1056
01:14:22,956 --> 01:14:24,291
We have no proof to refute it.

1057
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:26,860
Or corrupt FBI agents
following us home.

1058
01:14:26,893 --> 01:14:28,161
- And then there's that.
- Fine.

1059
01:14:28,194 --> 01:14:30,096
You want more proof,
I'll just call the FBI

1060
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,065
and ask for an interview with
the asshole that killed Dusty.

1061
01:14:32,098 --> 01:14:34,034
Mira, I know this is
frustrating,

1062
01:14:34,067 --> 01:14:36,002
but what we need is
an actual living person

1063
01:14:36,036 --> 01:14:37,570
who can help tell the story.

1064
01:14:37,604 --> 01:14:40,573
Someone with specifics who can
help fill in the basics.

1065
01:14:40,607 --> 01:14:44,444
The who, the what, the when.
And if we're lucky, the why.

1066
01:14:44,477 --> 01:14:46,012
The why is obvious.

1067
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:48,315
Obvious to you
isn't good enough.

1068
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:51,051
Listen, if we are dealing
with a corrupt head of the FBI,

1069
01:14:51,084 --> 01:14:53,053
they will cover up the cover up
with another cover up

1070
01:14:53,086 --> 01:14:54,587
and they'll spin it as
some top secret

1071
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:56,189
national security operation
that hides

1072
01:14:56,222 --> 01:14:58,191
behind the
veil of need-to-know.

1073
01:14:58,224 --> 01:15:01,895
The American people
need to know the truth.

1074
01:15:01,928 --> 01:15:03,596
That's what
I used to think.

1075
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,332
And you don't anymore?

1076
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:08,168
Honestly, undecided.

1077
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:10,170
Sometimes I think
it's better to live

1078
01:15:10,203 --> 01:15:12,205
in the happiness of the unknown.

1079
01:15:13,606 --> 01:15:15,175
The United States government is

1080
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:17,377
murdering its own
innocent citizens.

1081
01:15:20,947 --> 01:15:22,082
Yeah.

1082
01:15:23,616 --> 01:15:24,951
That is messed up.

1083
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:28,521
We need to nail these assholes.

1084
01:15:28,555 --> 01:15:30,223
Nothing? Nothing?

1085
01:15:30,256 --> 01:15:32,459
No forwarding address?
No phone records?

1086
01:15:32,492 --> 01:15:33,960
Would you be able to pull

1087
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:36,096
school enrollment records
for Natalie Block?

1088
01:15:36,129 --> 01:15:37,664
Check the entire country.

1089
01:15:37,697 --> 01:15:39,332
Actually, Sam, one more thing.

1090
01:15:39,366 --> 01:15:41,101
Search all informants
who recently entered

1091
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:42,369
Witness Protection.

1092
01:15:42,402 --> 01:15:43,903
They may have changed
their last names,

1093
01:15:43,937 --> 01:15:45,538
but they would have kept
their first.

1094
01:15:45,572 --> 01:15:47,474
Amanda and Natalie.

1095
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:49,442
Okay. Hey... hey, Sam.

1096
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:51,144
Let's keep this between us.

1097
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:53,613
Do this for me,
consider us even.

1098
01:15:53,646 --> 01:15:54,647
Thanks, Sam.

1099
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:03,523
Block.

1100
01:16:03,556 --> 01:16:05,692
Oh, yeah, uh, Mira.

1101
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:08,895
Listen, uh, now's not
a good time.

1102
01:16:12,165 --> 01:16:14,033
What do you have?

1103
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:15,535
Robinson's very capable

1104
01:16:15,568 --> 01:16:18,271
when it comes
to cleaning up his messes.

1105
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:21,040
I would say this has his
fingerprints all over it.

1106
01:16:21,074 --> 01:16:24,477
I need a quote
from a reliable source.

1107
01:16:24,511 --> 01:16:27,113
I'm the last person
you want as a source.

1108
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:28,381
But you know it's wrong.

1109
01:16:28,415 --> 01:16:31,017
I know what I know,
but my hands are dirty.

1110
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,486
You put my name out there,
my credibility,

1111
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,288
it'll come into question.

1112
01:16:35,321 --> 01:16:36,423
Even my sanity.

1113
01:16:36,456 --> 01:16:38,291
They'll say I made the
whole thing up,

1114
01:16:38,324 --> 01:16:41,561
all in the name of
protecting myself.

1115
01:16:41,594 --> 01:16:44,497
Probably wind up like Dusty.

1116
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:46,166
I still don't understand
why Robinson

1117
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,067
would go to all these lengths.

1118
01:16:49,102 --> 01:16:53,006
Same reason Hoover did it
for almost 50 years.

1119
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:55,408
To maintain power, control,

1120
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:58,511
which will give him a
shelf life that'll outlast

1121
01:16:58,545 --> 01:17:02,282
every politician on Capitol Hill
and in the White House.

1122
01:17:02,315 --> 01:17:04,451
You can't let them
get away with this.

1123
01:17:04,484 --> 01:17:07,454
I mean, this is your chance
to right all your wrongs.

1124
01:17:07,487 --> 01:17:10,156
What's done is done.
There's no going backwards.

1125
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,192
Then let's go forward
and prevent Robinson

1126
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:14,694
from abusing his power
in the future.

1127
01:17:14,727 --> 01:17:16,129
If we don't stand up to him,

1128
01:17:16,162 --> 01:17:18,097
he'll just keep growing
Operation Unity.

1129
01:17:19,098 --> 01:17:20,366
He probably will.

1130
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,070
Remember, it's your job
to protect the agents.

1131
01:17:24,103 --> 01:17:25,605
How many more Dusty's
have to die for you

1132
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:26,739
to stop looking the other way?

1133
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:33,580
As long as I've worked
for Robinson,

1134
01:17:33,613 --> 01:17:37,217
I've... I've never heard
of Operation Unity.

1135
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,485
Somebody must know.

1136
01:17:38,518 --> 01:17:40,587
These sort of people
don't talk out of turn.

1137
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:43,523
Maybe, but secrets
this big can't hide forever.

1138
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:49,362
Robinson has a safe in his house

1139
01:17:49,395 --> 01:17:51,798
where he keeps a
record of everyone

1140
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:54,267
and everything
the Bureau touches.

1141
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,070
- Everything?
- Everything.

1142
01:17:57,103 --> 01:17:59,506
It's his security blanket,

1143
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:03,710
ammunition in case anyone
decides to turn against him.

1144
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:10,149
If there's a paper trail on
Operation Unity, it's in there.

1145
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:10,637
What do you mean,
he blew up your car?

1146
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,739
Block shot it
with a grenade launcher.

1147
01:20:17,945 --> 01:20:19,880
I must never
underestimate that man.

1148
01:20:22,582 --> 01:20:25,385
Where is the crazy
son-of-a-bitch now?

1149
01:20:25,418 --> 01:20:26,753
Don't know.

1150
01:20:27,754 --> 01:20:29,656
Well, I do.

1151
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:30,790
He's here.

1152
01:20:30,823 --> 01:20:34,394
- Here as in?
- As in, my front door.

1153
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:37,630
If you're not too busy,
you might wanna stop by.

1154
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:47,306
Wasn't expecting you.

1155
01:20:48,608 --> 01:20:50,276
Got a minute?

1156
01:20:56,482 --> 01:20:59,252
- You sent them. Right.
- I sent who?

1157
01:20:59,285 --> 01:21:01,421
You know, if you were
just honest with me,

1158
01:21:01,454 --> 01:21:02,956
I'd have more respect for you.

1159
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:05,358
I take it this isn't
a friendly pop in.

1160
01:21:05,391 --> 01:21:06,592
What the hell do you want?

1161
01:21:06,626 --> 01:21:08,962
All your files
on Operation Unity.

1162
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,663
I'm afraid that's not happening.

1163
01:21:11,832 --> 01:21:13,599
It's not a request, Gabriel.

1164
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:16,937
This is a huge mistake.

1165
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,972
I'll add it to my list.
Open it.

1166
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:20,540
Or what?

1167
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:22,742
Are you really gonna
shoot me, Travis?

1168
01:21:23,743 --> 01:21:25,278
Yes, I will.

1169
01:21:31,018 --> 01:21:32,418
The hard drive.

1170
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:34,320
I need to see what's on it.

1171
01:21:34,353 --> 01:21:35,822
Load it up.

1172
01:21:43,763 --> 01:21:45,431
Step aside.

1173
01:21:50,603 --> 01:21:53,306
The world isn't ready
to see what's on that drive.

1174
01:21:53,339 --> 01:21:55,508
The truth can be difficult,

1175
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,577
but it's better than
the alternative.

1176
01:22:11,524 --> 01:22:13,060
You two, take the back.

1177
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:13,881
I recommend you walk away.

1178
01:24:13,914 --> 01:24:16,149
This is not your fight.

1179
01:24:16,183 --> 01:24:18,517
You were just taking orders.

1180
01:24:42,109 --> 01:24:44,144
Robinson's using you.

1181
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:45,946
The way he used me.

1182
01:24:48,181 --> 01:24:50,616
We're just bullets
in his chamber.

1183
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:21,114
Enough is enough!

1184
01:26:02,255 --> 01:26:03,723
Ah.

1185
01:27:59,072 --> 01:28:00,673
Travis.

1186
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:30,736
- Who are you?
- Uh...

1187
01:28:30,769 --> 01:28:32,372
This is Pearl.
She works with me.

1188
01:28:32,405 --> 01:28:34,875
Please don't shoot her.

1189
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,777
Can we trust her with this?

1190
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:40,247
We can.

1191
01:28:46,052 --> 01:28:47,988
Donuts? Really?

1192
01:28:48,021 --> 01:28:49,990
It... it was all I could
find in this dump.

1193
01:28:50,023 --> 01:28:52,159
So, Robinson hid
Amanda and Natalie

1194
01:28:52,192 --> 01:28:54,727
in Witness Protection?

1195
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,729
But no idea where they are?

1196
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,232
Uh-huh, okay.

1197
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:00,333
Thanks, Sam.

1198
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:02,668
Yeah. Appreciate you looking.

1199
01:29:10,043 --> 01:29:12,479
Using your family as leverage
against you is so effing wrong.

1200
01:29:12,512 --> 01:29:14,181
Sorry to say.

1201
01:29:14,214 --> 01:29:17,918
Seems relatively minor compared
to everything else he's doing.

1202
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:21,288
Character assassinations,
political blackmail.

1203
01:29:21,321 --> 01:29:22,923
Looks like flat out murder.

1204
01:29:22,956 --> 01:29:26,092
All under the guise
of protecting democracy.

1205
01:29:26,126 --> 01:29:28,694
What does it say
about Dusty Crane?

1206
01:29:30,997 --> 01:29:32,332
Looks like you've got
everything you'd ever

1207
01:29:32,365 --> 01:29:33,466
want to know about him.

1208
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,068
Oh, there's a video.

1209
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:36,236
Play it.

1210
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:39,339
Dustin Crane, Special Agent.

1211
01:29:39,372 --> 01:29:41,474
Your mission?

1212
01:29:41,508 --> 01:29:43,276
You know that.
It's deep infill.

1213
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:46,513
Have you maintained
contact with the target?

1214
01:29:46,546 --> 01:29:49,482
Yes, the target's name
is Sofia Flores.

1215
01:29:49,516 --> 01:29:51,784
How often
is your exposure?

1216
01:29:51,817 --> 01:29:52,986
Every day,
at least

1217
01:29:53,019 --> 01:29:54,820
a few hours a day,
sometimes longer.

1218
01:29:54,854 --> 01:29:56,122
How have you
been able to maintain that

1219
01:29:56,156 --> 01:29:59,326
level of contact with
an unsuspecting target?

1220
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:02,295
She, uh, she thinks
I'm her boyfriend.

1221
01:30:03,496 --> 01:30:04,965
And?

1222
01:30:04,998 --> 01:30:06,967
Are you her boyfriend?

1223
01:30:08,268 --> 01:30:10,837
I'd like to think so.

1224
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:12,973
How long has
this been going on?

1225
01:30:15,842 --> 01:30:18,245
A little over a year now.

1226
01:30:18,278 --> 01:30:21,014
And she has
no idea who you really are?

1227
01:30:22,349 --> 01:30:24,951
No, no. No, she doesn't.

1228
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:31,858
You can see
it in his face.

1229
01:30:31,891 --> 01:30:33,827
They were in love.

1230
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:36,762
I feel sick.

1231
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:05,191
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.

1232
01:31:05,225 --> 01:31:09,262
You knew Dusty Crane was
in love with Sofia Flores.

1233
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:10,196
Travis!

1234
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:12,299
You got nervous he might
come clean to her.

1235
01:31:12,332 --> 01:31:14,267
The thought that someone
with her influence

1236
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:16,569
might find out what you were
up to scared you.

1237
01:31:16,603 --> 01:31:18,571
You slippery shit.

1238
01:31:18,605 --> 01:31:20,073
Pull the damn car over.

1239
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:22,909
That's why you killed her,
and then him.

1240
01:31:22,942 --> 01:31:24,878
To protect your
secret operation.

1241
01:31:24,911 --> 01:31:26,946
You know nothing.

1242
01:31:31,251 --> 01:31:32,218
Listen carefully.

1243
01:31:32,252 --> 01:31:35,388
Operation Unity is going public.
The whole thing.

1244
01:31:35,422 --> 01:31:37,524
- Bullshit.
- You need to listen.

1245
01:31:37,557 --> 01:31:39,192
Not to you, I don't.

1246
01:31:41,995 --> 01:31:43,897
How about now?

1247
01:31:45,598 --> 01:31:47,600
Our arrangement never happened.

1248
01:31:47,634 --> 01:31:49,202
You're going to destroy my file

1249
01:31:49,235 --> 01:31:51,171
and forget everything
I've done for you.

1250
01:31:51,204 --> 01:31:52,972
After that, you will go public

1251
01:31:53,006 --> 01:31:54,607
with the truth
about the operation.

1252
01:31:54,641 --> 01:31:56,409
I am the director of the most

1253
01:31:56,443 --> 01:31:59,579
powerful organization
in the world.

1254
01:31:59,612 --> 01:32:02,449
I will not bargain with you.

1255
01:32:02,482 --> 01:32:04,351
Then call it coercion.

1256
01:32:04,384 --> 01:32:07,420
If I'm not being convincing
enough, there are other ways.

1257
01:32:23,136 --> 01:32:24,270
Ahh!

1258
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:35,982
Fine. We'll do it your way.

1259
01:32:36,015 --> 01:32:37,484
I'll clean your record.

1260
01:32:37,517 --> 01:32:41,221
But there is no chance in hell
I am admitting to anything,

1261
01:32:41,254 --> 01:32:45,458
and if I hear a whisper
of Operation Unity in the press,

1262
01:32:45,492 --> 01:32:48,895
you'll be indicted
before the day is over.

1263
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:55,135
That was the last threat
you will ever make to me.

1264
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,470
You wanna put a bullet
in your old friend?

1265
01:32:59,506 --> 01:33:01,541
Go ahead.

1266
01:33:01,574 --> 01:33:04,043
You'd be doing me a favor.

1267
01:33:05,011 --> 01:33:06,479
Please, do it.

1268
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:09,582
Do it!

1269
01:33:14,287 --> 01:33:15,288
No.

1270
01:33:15,321 --> 01:33:17,123
You're not getting
off that easy.

1271
01:33:17,157 --> 01:33:19,058
The truth needs to be told.

1272
01:33:19,092 --> 01:33:21,995
And you're gonna be
the one to tell it.

1273
01:33:22,028 --> 01:33:25,932
But first, you tell me.
Where's my family?

1274
01:33:57,764 --> 01:33:59,365
There she is!

1275
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:00,533
Grandpa!

1276
01:34:00,567 --> 01:34:03,336
Hey, come here to me.

1277
01:34:03,369 --> 01:34:05,472
You don't need to worry,
nobody's out there.

1278
01:34:05,505 --> 01:34:07,173
I've already checked.

1279
01:34:07,207 --> 01:34:09,209
Good, and there
probably never will be.

1280
01:34:09,242 --> 01:34:11,277
That's just how
my brain is wired.

1281
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:12,445
I know.

1282
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:13,713
I missed you.

1283
01:34:13,746 --> 01:34:15,381
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetheart.

1284
01:34:15,415 --> 01:34:16,683
Everything okay?

1285
01:34:16,716 --> 01:34:18,485
Just never thought we'd
be in Witness Protection.

1286
01:34:18,518 --> 01:34:20,653
- Sorry about all that.
- It's alright. We're fine.

1287
01:34:20,687 --> 01:34:23,323
I'm just sorry about everything
that you've been through.

1288
01:34:23,356 --> 01:34:25,425
- Is everything okay with you?
- Couldn't be better.

1289
01:34:26,192 --> 01:34:29,095
- Anybody wanna go home?
- I do!

1290
01:34:29,128 --> 01:34:31,064
- I do!
- Me, too.

1291
01:34:32,732 --> 01:34:35,502
"Robinson was indicted
after admitting to the existence

1292
01:34:35,535 --> 01:34:37,237
of the morally
reprehensible program

1293
01:34:37,270 --> 01:34:39,506
he dubbed Operation Unity.

1294
01:34:39,539 --> 01:34:42,175
He remains behind bars,
awaiting trial."

1295
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:43,676
Look at these comments.

1296
01:34:43,710 --> 01:34:45,645
"Explosive."

1297
01:34:45,678 --> 01:34:48,214
"The News Cycle at its finest."

1298
01:34:48,248 --> 01:34:49,349
Don't forget this one.

1299
01:34:49,382 --> 01:34:51,284
"Award-worthy reporting."

1300
01:34:52,252 --> 01:34:54,020
I'm proud of you, Mira.

1301
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:01,261
I saw it.

1302
01:35:01,294 --> 01:35:03,429
Well, what do you think?

1303
01:35:03,463 --> 01:35:06,834
Very thorough.
I, uh...

1304
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:11,271
I was surprised you didn't
mention my Vietnam mishap.

1305
01:35:11,304 --> 01:35:12,672
No use for you being on trial

1306
01:35:12,705 --> 01:35:15,241
for something you did
when you were a kid.

1307
01:35:21,581 --> 01:35:23,416
Article's good.

1308
01:35:23,449 --> 01:35:24,584
Thank you.

1309
01:35:24,617 --> 01:35:27,520
For... everything.

1310
01:35:27,554 --> 01:35:29,822
I couldn't have
done it without you.

1311
01:35:29,857 --> 01:35:34,661
And I wouldn't have done it
without you, so... thank you.

1312
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:37,430
You're welcome.

1313
01:35:37,463 --> 01:35:39,432
Take care, Mira.

1314
01:35:39,465 --> 01:35:40,633
You too.

1315
01:35:43,837 --> 01:35:46,439
Ah, a little help, please.

1316
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:50,076
Run, run, run!
Keep running!

1317
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,745
Go! That's a girl.

1318
01:35:52,779 --> 01:35:54,480
That's it, keep going.

1319
01:35:54,514 --> 01:35:57,684
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's flying! It's flying!

1320
01:35:57,717 --> 01:35:58,751
Atta girl.

1321
01:35:58,785 --> 01:36:00,119
You're pretty good at that.

1322
01:36:00,153 --> 01:36:03,423
A bit rusty. Go!

1323
01:36:03,456 --> 01:36:05,859
You sure you don't wanna hang
out with us this weekend?

1324
01:36:05,893 --> 01:36:07,427
I'm good.

1325
01:36:08,728 --> 01:36:10,163
I have a date.

1326
01:36:10,196 --> 01:36:12,298
- Good for you.
- Yeah, we'll see.

1327
01:36:12,332 --> 01:36:14,233
But if you or Natalie need
anything, just let me know.

1328
01:36:14,267 --> 01:36:15,335
Uh-huh. Will do.

1329
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:16,736
And don't forget to feed her.

1330
01:36:16,769 --> 01:36:18,237
Make sure she brushes
her teeth, get her to school

1331
01:36:18,271 --> 01:36:19,472
on time, Monday morning.

1332
01:36:19,505 --> 01:36:21,842
Food, teeth, school.
Consider it done.

1333
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,376
Anything else?

1334
01:36:24,277 --> 01:36:26,479
No shooting guns.

1335
01:36:26,512 --> 01:36:27,647
Uh-huh.

1336
01:36:28,648 --> 01:36:30,249
No guns.

1337
01:36:32,485 --> 01:36:34,287
Where do you stand
on explosives?

1338
01:36:54,751 --> 01:36:57,454
