00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,235
Today, we're
looking at some of the hottest weather...

3
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,458
Hey.

4
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:12,072
What is it?

5
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:15,727
What?

6
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,642
We've been ordered
to stand down.

7
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:19,078
They're scrapping the program.

8
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,255
They say we fell short.

9
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,562
The contract threshold
is mach 10.

10
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:26,825
Mach 10 is supposed to be
in two months.

11
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,740
Today's test point is mach 9.

12
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,655
Well, that's not good enough.

13
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:32,135
Says who?

14
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:33,832
Admiral Cain.

15
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,530
The drone ranger.

16
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:39,142
He wants our budget for
his unmanned program.

17
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:42,754
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

18
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,073
Well, he isn't here yet.

19
00:06:02,338 --> 00:06:03,556
They want mach 10,

20
00:06:04,383 --> 00:06:05,602
let 's give' em mach 10.

21
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:26,448
Now remember, the
contract threshold is mach 10.

22
00:06:26,622 --> 00:06:30,017
Not 10.1. Not 10.2.
Mach 10.

23
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,194
That should keep
the program alive.

24
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,675
I Don't like that look, mav.

25
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:40,201
It's the only one I got.

26
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,690
Control, this is
dark star. How do you read?

27
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,171
Dark star, control.
Loud and clear. How me?

28
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:57,478
Loud and clear. Takeoff precheck's
complete. Ready for apu start.

29
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,307
Ready left engine start.

30
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:03,527
Ready right engine start.

31
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,747
Thumbs for taxi.

32
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,925
We are ready for taxi.

33
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:14,842
Tower, this is dark star. We
are taxiing with information Alpha.

34
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:16,951
Dark star, you are clear to taxi.

35
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:19,847
Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.

36
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,458
Fuel temps are looking
good. control concurs.

37
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:25,200
Battery's holding at
95%. Cabin pressure looks good.

38
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:28,334
Control concurs. Tower,
this is dark star. We're ready for takeoff.

39
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:31,251
Requesting an unrestricted
climb to 600 and above.

40
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,881
Dark star,
the runway and skies are yours.

41
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:36,167
Rear admiral Chester Cain.

42
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:39,344
Maverick,
Cain just pulled up to the gate.

43
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:41,433
It's not too late to stop,
buddy.

44
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:45,567
You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.

45
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,789
I know what happens
to everyone else if I Don't.

46
00:07:52,052 --> 00:07:54,010
Dark star is ready for takeoff.

47
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,275
Everyone,

48
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,799
go for takeoff,
starting with engine.

49
00:08:00,973 --> 00:08:02,670
Engine, go. Thermals, go.

50
00:08:02,845 --> 00:08:04,759
Fuel, go. Electric, go.

51
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,674
Control surfaces, go.

52
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,068
Dark star, control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

53
00:08:09,242 --> 00:08:10,809
All right, sweetheart,

54
00:08:11,462 --> 00:08:12,506
one last ride.

55
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:42,274
Dark star, you are cleared
above 600. Increase to mach 3.5.

56
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:46,278
Cleared above 600.
Increase to mach 3.5.

57
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:53,981
Admiral.

58
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:56,897
Uh, just in time, sir.
I'm early. So are you.

59
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,463
You care to explain?

60
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,596
Transitioning to scramjet.

61
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,306
Uh, mav,
admiral Cain is asking...

62
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,874
Ordering. Ordering that we
bring her down.

63
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,331
Op... oop... Alpha...

64
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,617
Three, oh...

65
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,838
As sing... ach...
Ive... 4, and...

66
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,928
Within six...

67
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,993
This is where we've had
trouble with comms, sir.

68
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,256
It's the earth's curvature.
It's called 'earth bulge.'

69
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,715
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

70
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:36,412
Okay.

71
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,032
He's at mach 7, pushing 8.

72
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,425
Flight data? Receiving. Data is good.

73
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:56,998
Temperature's climbing. Response
is still stable. We're feeling good.

74
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:02,090
Mach 8.8.

75
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:04,092
8.9.

76
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:05,920
Mach 9.

77
00:10:06,094 --> 00:10:07,835
He's the fastest man alive.

78
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:28,725
Talk to me, goose.

79
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:31,858
Mach 9.1.

80
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:33,860
9.2.

81
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,347
Mach 9.3.

82
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,264
9.4.

83
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:49,745
Approaching high hypersonic.

84
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:03,671
Windshield hot caution.

85
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:14,420
Surface temp rising.

86
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:21,776
Come on, sweetheart,
just a little more.

87
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:24,344
Just a little.

88
00:11:27,434 --> 00:11:28,434
Come on!

89
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:35,919
Come on!

90
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:43,710
Mach 10!

91
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,800
Put that
in your Pentagon budget!

92
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:49,933
Sir.

93
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,671
Oh,
Don 't do it. Don' t do it.

94
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:03,816
Just...

95
00:12:05,731 --> 00:12:07,907
A little push.

96
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,651
Holy shit.

97
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:26,187
You got some
balls, stick jockey.

98
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,710
I'll give you that.

99
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,193
Oh, shit.

100
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,632
Maverick.

101
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:42,853
Maverick!

102
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,164
Thank you.

103
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,601
Where am I?

104
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:38,864
Earth.

105
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:54,705
Maverick.

106
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,186
Thirty-plus years of service.

107
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,666
Combat medals.

108
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,755
Citations.

109
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:06,238
Only man to shoot down three
enemy planes in the last 40 years.

110
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,239
'Distinguished.'

111
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:11,896
'Distinguished.'
'distinguished.'

112
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,988
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

113
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:20,121
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

114
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:25,170
You should be at least a two-star
admiral by now, if not a senator.

115
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:26,998
Yet here you are:

116
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:29,739
Captain.

117
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,002
Why is that?

118
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:34,526
It's one of
life's mysteries, sir.

119
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,747
This isn't a joke.
I asked you a question.

120
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,055
I'm where I belong, sir.

121
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,058
Well, the Navy
doesn't see it that way.

122
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,190
Not anymore.

123
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,367
These planes
you've been testing,

124
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:52,804
captain,

125
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:56,243
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

126
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,811
Pilots that need to sleep,
eat, take a piss.

127
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,207
Pilots that disobey orders.

128
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:08,558
All you did was buy some
time for those men out there.

129
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:11,910
The future is coming,

130
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,783
and you're not in it.

131
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,787
Escort this man off the base.

132
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,659
Take him to his quarters.

133
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,271
Wait with him
while he packs his gear.

134
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:29,753
I want him on the road to
north island within the hour.

135
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,541
North island, sir?

136
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,935
Call came in
with impeccable timing,

137
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:42,549
right as I was driving here to
ground your ass once and for all.

138
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:45,726
It galls me to say it, but...

139
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,904
For reasons known only to the
almighty and your guardian angel...

140
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,300
You've been called back
to top gun.

141
00:15:59,478 --> 00:16:02,916
Sir? You are dismissed,
captain.

142
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:10,750
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

143
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,926
Your kind is headed
for extinction.

144
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,235
Maybe so, sir.

145
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,326
But not today.

146
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:29,739
Captain Pete
'Maverick' Mitchell.

147
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:31,784
Your reputation precedes you.

148
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,134
Thank you, sir.

149
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,919
Wasn't a compliment.

150
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,792
I'm admiral Beau Simpson.
I'm the air boss.

151
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,578
I believe
you know admiral bates. Warlock, sir.

152
00:17:43,752 --> 00:17:46,406
Must admit, I wasn't
expecting an invitation back.

153
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,364
They're called orders, Maverick.

154
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,149
You two have
something in common.

155
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:54,022
Cyclone here was first
in his class back in '88.

156
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,372
Actually, sir,
I finished second.

157
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:58,809
Just want to manage
expectations.

158
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:04,293
The target...

159
00:18:06,426 --> 00:18:09,037
Is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

160
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,605
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

161
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:14,608
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

162
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:16,000
to our allies in the region.

163
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:17,785
The Pentagon has tasked us

164
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,352
with assembling a strike
team and taking it out

165
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:23,138
before it becomes
fully operational.

166
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:27,010
The plant sits in an underground
bunker at the end of this valley.

167
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:28,838
Said valley is GPS-jammed

168
00:18:29,012 --> 00:18:31,667
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

169
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:34,453
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

170
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:38,457
which in turn are backed up by a
plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

171
00:18:38,631 --> 00:18:40,894
Even a few old f-14s.

172
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:43,428
Seems like we're not the only
ones holding on to old relics.

173
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,203
What's your read, captain?

174
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:52,470
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the f-35's stealth,

175
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,342
but the GPS-jamming
negates that.

176
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,129
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

177
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:00,609
tailor-made for the f-18.

178
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:02,350
I figure,

179
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,394
two precision bombs, minimum.

180
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:07,441
Makes it four aircraft
flying in pairs.

181
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:09,704
That is one hell of a
steep climb out of there,

182
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:12,141
exposing you to all
the surface-to-air missiles.

183
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:14,143
You survive that,

184
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,972
it's a dogfight
all the way home.

185
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:20,236
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

186
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,543
Not in the same mission, sir.

187
00:19:25,284 --> 00:19:26,328
No.

188
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:31,508
No, someone's
not coming back from this.

189
00:19:31,682 --> 00:19:33,074
Can it be done or not?

190
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:35,555
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

191
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,557
Three weeks. Maybe less.

192
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,474
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an f-18, and...

193
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,911
I 'm not sure who I' d trust
to fly the other three.

194
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:47,131
But I'll find a way
to make it work.

195
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,959
I think you misunderstand,
captain.

196
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:50,525
Sir?

197
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,440
We Don't want you to fly it.

198
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:53,833
We want you to teach it.

199
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,012
Teach, sir?

200
00:19:59,623 --> 00:20:03,016
We've recalled 12 top gun
graduates from their squadrons.

201
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,410
We want you to narrow
that pool down to six.

202
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,152
They'll fly the mission.

203
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,285
Is there a problem, captain?

204
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,507
You know there is, sir.

205
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:17,814
Yeah.

206
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:20,512
Bradley bradshaw,
aka 'rooster.'

207
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,513
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

208
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,515
What was his call sign?

209
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,778
'Goose,' sir.

210
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:28,345
Tragic what happened.

211
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,359
Captain Mitchell was
cleared of any wrongdoing.

212
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,131
Goose's death was an accident.

213
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:33,945
Is that how you see it, captain?

214
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:36,092
Is that how goose's son sees it?

215
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,010
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

216
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:43,794
You were a top gun
instructor before.

217
00:20:43,968 --> 00:20:46,275
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

218
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:47,581
It's not where I belong.

219
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:49,887
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

220
00:20:50,061 --> 00:20:53,936
You were not my first choice. In
fact, you weren't even on the list.

221
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,156
You are here at the request
of admiral kazansky.

222
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,943
Now, iceman happens to be
a man I deeply admire,

223
00:21:01,117 --> 00:21:04,075
and he seems to think that you
have something left to offer the Navy.

224
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,730
What that is, I can't imagine.

225
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,212
You Don't have to take this job.

226
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:11,605
But let me be clear:

227
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:14,695
This will be your last post,
captain.

228
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:19,874
You fly for top gun, or you
Don't fly for the Navy ever again.

229
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:30,486
Twenty bucks
you can't get three in a row.

230
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,795
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

231
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,581
Pete.

232
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:19,974
Penny?

233
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:22,411
What are you doing here?

234
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:24,457
I should ask you the same thing.

235
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,808
Well, that is a long story. I doubt that.

236
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:28,983
Yeah.

237
00:22:29,157 --> 00:22:30,593
Who'd you piss off this time?

238
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,073
Another admiral.

239
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,292
Exactly.

240
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,905
Are you mad at me? Oh, Pete.

241
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,168
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

242
00:22:42,342 --> 00:22:43,604
Huh.

243
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,216
I got to say, north island
is the one place

244
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,131
I thought for sure
I'd never run into you.

245
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:50,177
Mmm.
How long you been here?

246
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,049
Bought this place
about three years ago.

247
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:54,616
Three years? Mm-hmm. Yeah.

248
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,664
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

249
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,710
That was three years ago?

250
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:04,887
You must be in a lot of trouble.

251
00:23:05,061 --> 00:23:07,672
No way you'd come
back here willingly.

252
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:10,457
Well,

253
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:12,895
you'll sort it out.

254
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:14,766
No, I think, uh...

255
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,596
I think this is it. Come on, Pete.

256
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,467
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

257
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:25,167
You said it after they busted you
for taking me on a joyride in that f-18.

258
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:28,126
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

259
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,347
Then Iraq. Both times.

260
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:33,131
You get yourself in trouble,

261
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:37,048
iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

262
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,658
Penny, this is different.

263
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:40,268
Pete, trust me,

264
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:42,618
as improbable
as it seems right now,

265
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:46,100
somehow you'll be back in a
fighter plane with your tail on fire.

266
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:48,930
Penny... too late.

267
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:50,366
What?

268
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,455
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

269
00:23:56,024 --> 00:23:57,677
Don't give me that look.

270
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,855
I'm not giving you any look.
I swear.

271
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:04,553
It always ends
the same with us, Pete.

272
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:07,861
Let's not start this time.

273
00:24:12,256 --> 00:24:13,256
Okay.

274
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,651
Okay.

275
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:21,221
You look good.

276
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:32,972
Much appreciated, pal.

277
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:36,802
What am I missing?

278
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:43,068
'Disrespect a lady, the Navy, or
put your cell phone on my bar...'

279
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:45,027
'And you buy a round.'

280
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,899
For everyone?

281
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:49,684
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

282
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:52,643
Oh, come on!

283
00:24:52,818 --> 00:24:55,037
What do we have here?

284
00:24:56,734 --> 00:24:58,953
If it ain't Phoenix!

285
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,521
And here I thought
we were special, coyote.

286
00:25:02,957 --> 00:25:05,830
Turns out the invite
went to anyone.

287
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:08,136
Fellas, this here's bag man.

288
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,269
Hangman.whatever.

289
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,793
You're looking at the only
naval aviator on active duty

290
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:14,316
with a confirmed
air-to-air kill.

291
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,840
Stop.

292
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,841
Mind you, the other guy
was in a museum piece

293
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,364
from the Korean war.

294
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:22,193
Cold war. Different wars,
same century.

295
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:23,367
Not this one.

296
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,717
Who are your friends?

297
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:26,806
Payback.fanboy.

298
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,895
Hey, coyote.Hey.

299
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,636
Who 's he? Who' s who?

300
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,597
When did you get in?

301
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:37,642
Oh, I've been here
the whole time.

302
00:25:37,816 --> 00:25:40,340
The man's a stealth pilot.Literally.

303
00:25:40,514 --> 00:25:42,778
Weapons systems officer,
actually.

304
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:44,780
With no sense of humor.

305
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:48,088
What do they call you?

306
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:50,047
Bob.

307
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:51,483
No, your call sign.

308
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:53,180
Uh...

309
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,617
Bob.

310
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,705
Bob Floyd.

311
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,534
You're my new backs eater?
From lemoore?

312
00:26:01,666 --> 00:26:03,798
Looks like it. Yeah.

313
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:07,585
Nine-ball, Bob.

314
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:10,065
Rack 'em.

315
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:13,069
Okay.

316
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:15,767
Penny, my dear. yeah.

317
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,073
I'll have four more
on the old-timer.

318
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:29,258
That's all right,
mama. Uh, what's up?

319
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,046
Bradshaw!

320
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,701
Is that you?

321
00:26:44,316 --> 00:26:46,362
This is how I find out
you're stateside?

322
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:48,407
Yeah, I just thought
I'd surprise you.Hmm.

323
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,325
I guess I surprised you back.

324
00:26:54,936 --> 00:26:56,849
It's good to see you. Good to see you too.

325
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:01,202
Here you go. thank you.

326
00:27:01,376 --> 00:27:03,073
Much appreciated, pops.

327
00:27:11,168 --> 00:27:13,388
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

328
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,663
Bradshaw.

329
00:27:28,837 --> 00:27:30,447
As I live and breathe.

330
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,274
Hangman.

331
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:34,538
You look... good.

332
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:37,454
Well, I am good, rooster.

333
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:40,674
I'm very good.

334
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:42,328
In fact,

335
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:44,199
I am too good to be true.

336
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,853
So,

337
00:27:46,027 --> 00:27:48,203
anybody know what this special
detachment is all about?

338
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:51,641
No, mission's a mission.
They Don't confront me.

339
00:27:51,815 --> 00:27:54,427
What I want to know:
Who's gonna be team leader?

340
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:56,950
And which one of y'all

341
00:27:57,124 --> 00:27:59,822
has what it takes to follow me?

342
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,218
Hangman, the only place you'll
lead anyone is an early grave.

343
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:06,220
Whoo!

344
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:17,709
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

345
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:19,928
But that's just you,
ain't it, rooster?

346
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:23,236
You're snug on that perch,

347
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,109
waiting for just
the right moment...

348
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:29,982
That never comes.

349
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:34,334
I love this song!

350
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:43,735
Well, he hasn't changed.

351
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,520
Nope. Sure hasn't.

352
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:53,484
Check it out.

353
00:28:53,658 --> 00:28:55,528
More patches.

354
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,314
That's Harvard,
Yale, Omaha. Shit, that's Fritz.

355
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,316
What the hell
kind of mission is this?

356
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:04,320
That's not the question
we should be asking.

357
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,496
Everyone here
is the best there is.

358
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:09,977
Who the hell are they
gonna get to teach us?

359
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:14,807
It's been declined.

360
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:16,331
You're kidding.

361
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,870
Hey, guys. Come on.

362
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:49,407
How about...

363
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,454
That won't cover it.

364
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:00,591
Uh, I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

365
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,551
I'm afraid
rules are rules, Pete.

366
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:13,342
Overboard!
Overboard! Overboard!

367
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:14,517
Really?

368
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:15,910
Overboard!

369
00:30:16,084 --> 00:30:18,869
Overboard! Overboard!

370
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:21,742
Overboard! Overboard!

371
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:24,527
Overboard! Overboard!

372
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:25,963
Overboard!

373
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,488
Great to see you, Pete! Overboard!

374
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,796
Overboard! Overboard!

375
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,101
Overboard!

376
00:30:35,147 --> 00:30:37,497
Thanks for the beers!
Come back anytime!

377
00:31:39,557 --> 00:31:42,603
Altitude 8,000... 7,000...

378
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,953
Goose, I can't reach
the ejection handle.

379
00:31:45,127 --> 00:31:47,173
Eject, eject, eject!

380
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,484
Goose! Oh, no!

381
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:57,443
God, he loved flying
with you, Maverick.

382
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:42,660
Attention on deck!

383
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,237
Morning.

384
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,457
Welcome to your special
training detachment.

385
00:32:57,631 --> 00:32:58,849
Be seated.

386
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:01,852
I'm admiral bates,
nawdc commander.

387
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:03,767
You're all top gun graduates.

388
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,769
The elite.

389
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,337
The best of the best.

390
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,252
That was yesterday.

391
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:15,343
The enemy's new fifth-generation
fighter has leveled the playing field.

392
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,040
Details are few,
but you can be sure

393
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:19,134
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

394
00:33:19,304 --> 00:33:22,525
Success, now more than ever,

395
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:25,702
comes down to the man or woman
in the box.

396
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,010
Half of you will make the cut.

397
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:30,967
One of you will
be named mission leader.

398
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:33,883
The other half
will remain in reserve.

399
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,234
Your instructor
is a top gun graduate

400
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:39,846
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

401
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,543
you will be expected to master.

402
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,720
His exploits are legendary.

403
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:48,289
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

404
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:50,464
this program has ever produced.

405
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,554
What he has to teach you

406
00:33:53,728 --> 00:33:56,949
may very well mean the
difference between life and death.

407
00:33:57,906 --> 00:34:00,213
I give you
captain Pete Mitchell.

408
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,042
'Maverick.'

409
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,961
Good morning.

410
00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:18,927
The f-18 natops.

411
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,890
It contains everything they want
you to know about your aircraft.

412
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:27,806
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

413
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,110
Damn right. Damn straight.

414
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,460
You got it.

415
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,947
So does your enemy.

416
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,123
And we're off.

417
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:46,345
But what the enemy
doesn't know is your limits.

418
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,781
I intend to find them,

419
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:50,522
test them,

420
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,350
push beyond.

421
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:57,311
Today we'll start with
what you only think you know.

422
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:00,924
You show me what you're made of.

423
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,147
Rooster.

424
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:09,278
Bradley.

425
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,194
Lieutenant bradshaw!

426
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:14,719
Yes, sir.

427
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,419
Let's not do it like this.

428
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,160
You gonna wash me out?

429
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:22,946
That'll be up to you, not me.

430
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,602
Am I dismissed?

431
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,490
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

432
00:35:46,664 --> 00:35:48,796
Welcome to basic
fighter maneuvers.

433
00:35:50,362 --> 00:35:53,235
As briefed, today's exercise
is dog fighting.

434
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:55,019
Guns only, no missiles.

435
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,067
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

436
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:02,070
Working as a team, you have
to shoot me down, or else.

437
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:05,508
Or else what, sir? Or else I shoot back.

438
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:08,510
If I shoot either one of
you down, you both lose.

439
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:11,905
This guy needs an ego
check. We'll see to that.

440
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,648
What say we put some skin in the
game? What do you have in mind?

441
00:36:14,822 --> 00:36:17,564
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

442
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:20,436
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

443
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,612
They Don't call it an
exercise for nothing, sir.

444
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:24,614
You got yourself a deal,
gentlemen.

445
00:36:24,788 --> 00:36:27,094
Fight's on.
Let's turn and burn.

446
00:36:28,704 --> 00:36:31,359
Fanboy, you see him?
Nothing on radar up ahead.

447
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,013
He must be somewhere behind us.

448
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,494
Yeah!

449
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:37,147
Damn it! What the hell?

450
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,321
Shit!

451
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:43,937
Easy, Maverick.

452
00:36:44,111 --> 00:36:46,852
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

453
00:36:47,026 --> 00:36:49,811
Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's
coming in! Break left!

454
00:36:49,985 --> 00:36:51,160
Breaking left.

455
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:55,121
Payback, where's your wing man?

456
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:57,427
Rooster, where are you? I got your back.

457
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:59,995
I'm coming. Hang in there.
Hang in there.

458
00:37:00,169 --> 00:37:01,519
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

459
00:37:05,261 --> 00:37:08,437
Payback, break right. Breaking right.

460
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:11,920
Rooster just saved your life,
fellas. But it's gonna cost him.

461
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,748
Not this time, old man.

462
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,057
Don't let him
get to you, Maverick.

463
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:27,587
Rooster, you're too low! Pull
up! You're hitting the hard deck!

464
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:30,242
Altitude. Altitude. oh, shit.

465
00:37:34,028 --> 00:37:35,595
That's a kill.

466
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:41,687
Down! 110.

467
00:37:43,646 --> 00:37:45,299
That should be us
down there. 111!

468
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:46,909
But it's not. Down!

469
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,868
And now you know a little
something about rooster.

470
00:37:50,652 --> 00:37:52,479
Whoo! Wow.

471
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,980
Hold that tarmac down
till we get back, brother, all right?

472
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:56,590
Get in there, boys.

473
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:00,618
That's a kill. Damn!

474
00:38:01,401 --> 00:38:03,186
Smoked. Damn it.

475
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,101
It was all fun and games in
that selfie, wasn't it? Down!

476
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,319
Say, Phoenix.

477
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,514
How's about we tell everybody

478
00:38:08,538 --> 00:38:10,454
'Bob' stands for something?

479
00:38:10,628 --> 00:38:12,693
Other than Robert, I mean.
Don't take the bait, Bob.

480
00:38:12,717 --> 00:38:14,632
Want to know why
we call him hangman?

481
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,982
I got it. 'Baby on board.'

482
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,943
Shit!

483
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:24,120
Greetings, aviators.
Fight's on.

484
00:38:24,294 --> 00:38:26,948
All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!

485
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:28,210
Watch your back, Phoenix.

486
00:38:28,384 --> 00:38:30,255
Break right! Breaking right.

487
00:38:32,649 --> 00:38:33,650
Where's he going?

488
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:35,304
That's why we call him hangman.

489
00:38:35,478 --> 00:38:36,827
He'll always
hang you out to dry.

490
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:39,264
Leaving your wing man.

491
00:38:39,438 --> 00:38:41,155
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

492
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:43,529
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

493
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,158
So long as he doesn't
call you a man.

494
00:38:45,182 --> 00:38:47,054
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

495
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,143
Jesus, his nose
is already coming around!

496
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:51,145
Get him off me, hangman!

497
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:54,670
For all you folks at
home, this is how you Bury a fossil.

498
00:38:54,844 --> 00:38:57,368
All right, hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

499
00:38:57,542 --> 00:38:59,283
You're out, Phoenix. Son of a bitch!

500
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:01,982
That's it.

501
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:03,524
Let's go, mav.
Let's see what you got.

502
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,810
Come get me.

503
00:39:06,726 --> 00:39:08,423
Evil be gone.
Hangman's coming.

504
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:11,818
Yeah, you're good.
I'll give you that.

505
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:21,523
Phoenix, I can't see him.
How close am I?

506
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:23,960
Phoenix? I'm dead, dickhead.

507
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:25,918
See you in the afterlife,
bag man.

508
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:29,530
Where is he?
Where is he?

509
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:30,923
That's a kill.

510
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:35,101
Seventy-nine. Down.
Eighty. Down.

511
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:36,595
Let 's go. Who' s next?

512
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,583
I got you, Omaha. Damn it!

513
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,762
Lights out, coyote. Copy kill.

514
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:49,418
Down. Fifty-one.
Down. Fifty-two.

515
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:55,163
So, rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

516
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:56,599
Would it matter if I did?

517
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,906
What's the story
with you and Maverick?

518
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,996
It seems like he's got you rattled.
That's none of your business.

519
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,911
Now where the hell is he?

520
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,739
Been here the whole time.

521
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,699
Holy shit.

522
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:11,963
You see me now?

523
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:14,661
Come on, let's get it over with.

524
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,707
Fight's on!

525
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:20,711
What is with these two?

526
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:28,630
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

527
00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:31,329
You can bail out anytime.

528
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:33,157
How low you want to go, rooster?

529
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:36,160
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

530
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,948
What's past is past.
For both of us.

531
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:43,862
You'd like to believe that,
wouldn't you?

532
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:47,953
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

533
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:51,167
Altitude. Your strategy
is about to run us into the ground.

534
00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:53,611
What's your move?
Altitude. Altitude.

535
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,178
Altitude.

536
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:59,748
Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.

537
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:02,360
Altitude. Altitude.

538
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:07,016
Pull up! Pull up!
Pull up! Pull up!

539
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,757
Pull up! Pull up!

540
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:14,240
You got it.
Don't think, just do.

541
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:17,461
Come on, rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

542
00:41:19,071 --> 00:41:20,071
It's too low.

543
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:22,770
Too late. You had your chance.

544
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:31,648
That's a kill. Knock it off.

545
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:33,650
Damn it!

546
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,739
Same old rooster.

547
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,613
Go see hon do
about your push-ups.

548
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:50,231
All right, that's enough.

549
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:53,060
Rooster.
That's enough, man.

550
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:11,034
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

551
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:12,819
Don't worry about it.

552
00:42:12,993 --> 00:42:15,473
Look, I'm going on this mission.

553
00:42:16,997 --> 00:42:19,390
But if you get kicked out, you
leave us flying with hangman.

554
00:42:19,564 --> 00:42:23,567
Talk to me. What the hell
was that? He pulled my papers.

555
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:27,180
What? Who? Maverick.

556
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,923
He pulled my application
to the naval academy.

557
00:42:32,011 --> 00:42:34,013
Set me back four years.

558
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:37,973
Why would he do that?

559
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,327
The hard deck is
5,000 feet above ground level.

560
00:42:46,501 --> 00:42:48,697
A parameter is set not just
for the safety of our pilots,

561
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:50,592
but for the safety
of their aircraft.

562
00:42:50,766 --> 00:42:54,596
5,000 feet is not just a rule. It is
a law, as immutable as gravity.

563
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,339
The hard deck will be much
lower for the mission, sir.

564
00:42:57,513 --> 00:43:00,560
And it will not change
without my approval!

565
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:02,866
Especially not
in the middle of an exercise.

566
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,478
And that cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

567
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:08,567
I never want to see
that shit again.

568
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:11,918
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, captain?

569
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,592
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

570
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:17,247
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, captain.

571
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:19,075
And they've been told that
their entire career,

572
00:43:19,099 --> 00:43:20,902
while they've been dropping
bombs from a high altitude

573
00:43:20,926 --> 00:43:22,972
with little to no dog fighting.

574
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:25,820
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

575
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:30,022
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

576
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:31,458
and how to strike the target.

577
00:43:31,632 --> 00:43:33,373
And how to come home.

578
00:43:36,202 --> 00:43:38,204
And how to come home, sir.

579
00:43:43,905 --> 00:43:46,385
Every mission has its risks.

580
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,213
These pilots accept that.

581
00:43:48,387 --> 00:43:49,954
I Don't, sir.

582
00:43:54,046 --> 00:43:55,613
Every morning,
from this day forward,

583
00:43:55,787 --> 00:43:58,268
you will brief us on your
instructional plans in writing.

584
00:43:58,442 --> 00:44:01,270
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

585
00:44:01,444 --> 00:44:04,577
Including the hard deck, sir?
Especially the hard deck, captain.

586
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:07,754
Sir.

587
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:10,018
What is this?

588
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:11,933
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

589
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,587
to practice a low-level bombing
run per the mission parameters.

590
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:22,855
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, captain.

591
00:44:23,682 --> 00:44:24,682
Yo, coyote.

592
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:26,642
Take a look at this.

593
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,170
The man, the legend.
There he is.

594
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:35,346
No, no, no.
Next to him.

595
00:44:36,304 --> 00:44:38,349
He look familiar to you?

596
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:41,917
What have we here?

597
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,398
Bradshaw.

598
00:44:45,355 --> 00:44:47,009
As I live and breathe.

599
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:52,798
Hey, Theo, you got big.

600
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,670
Hey, mav.

601
00:45:01,806 --> 00:45:02,806
Amelia?

602
00:45:02,938 --> 00:45:04,418
I know. I got big.

603
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:05,854
Yes.

604
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:08,117
Bar opens at 5:00.

605
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,946
No, I just came by
to pay off a debt.

606
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,382
Mom!

607
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:19,954
Hey, how's your dad?
With his wife, in Hawaii.

608
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:21,521
Mom!

609
00:45:22,478 --> 00:45:25,177
Mav says he owes you money.

610
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:28,093
Oh. Don't worry
about it. I insist.

611
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,013
Thank you, captain.
Consider your tab closed.

612
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,798
Captain? Still?

613
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:40,495
A highly decorated captain.

614
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:41,801
Finish up.

615
00:45:41,975 --> 00:45:43,542
We have to get the boat
to the yard.

616
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:45,587
I can't go. What do you mean,
you can't go?

617
00:45:45,761 --> 00:45:49,027
Test tomorrow. I have to
study. They only told us today.

618
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:51,029
Well, I can't sail her alone.

619
00:45:51,203 --> 00:45:52,552
Just use the engine.

620
00:45:52,726 --> 00:45:54,771
Why are we taking her
to the yard?

621
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:56,686
To fix the engine.

622
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,774
Mm-hmm. I can help.

623
00:46:05,042 --> 00:46:08,175
Little rougher
than I was expecting. You Don't say.

624
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,787
Pull on the back stay.
We'll de-power the sails.

625
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:13,354
Okay.

626
00:46:13,528 --> 00:46:15,095
What does that mean?

627
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:18,706
You're supposed to be
in the Navy!

628
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,580
I Don't sail boats, penny.
I land on them.

629
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:25,844
It's sort of like raising
the flaps on an airplane.

630
00:46:26,018 --> 00:46:27,759
So how do I do that?

631
00:46:27,933 --> 00:46:30,370
You pull on
that green line up there.

632
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:31,893
Green line.

633
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:35,897
Yep. Pull it hard.

634
00:46:36,072 --> 00:46:38,856
Yep. Crank that winch
right there,

635
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,858
tighten the jib.

636
00:46:41,685 --> 00:46:43,904
Crank it.
You okay? Yeah.

637
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,429
Good.

638
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:48,649
Now,

639
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:51,217
you ready?

640
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,873
For what?

641
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:56,614
The afterburner.

642
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:18,764
Now you're in the Navy.

643
00:47:41,045 --> 00:47:42,873
Thanks for helping out today.

644
00:47:44,572 --> 00:47:46,008
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

645
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:49,011
Hmm.

646
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:52,841
Don't give me that look.

647
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:54,277
What look?

648
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:56,105
That one.

649
00:47:59,368 --> 00:48:00,674
Good night, Pete.

650
00:48:01,457 --> 00:48:02,806
Night, penny.

651
00:48:18,256 --> 00:48:20,214
Mom, is that you?

652
00:48:20,388 --> 00:48:21,694
Yeah, it's me.

653
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:24,305
I'll make you dinner.

654
00:48:24,479 --> 00:48:25,480
Okay.

655
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:33,923
Time is your greatest enemy.

656
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:37,443
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

657
00:48:37,578 --> 00:48:39,276
attacking in two-plane teams.

658
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,062
You'll fly along this narrow
canyon to your target.

659
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:45,544
Radar-guided surface-to-air
missiles defend the area.

660
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:48,503
These sams, they're lethal.

661
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:52,464
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

662
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,293
That's because the enemy knows no one
is insane enough to try and fly below them.

663
00:48:57,598 --> 00:49:00,166
That's exactly what
I'm gonna train you to do.

664
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,518
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

665
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,128
You exceed this altitude...

666
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,522
...Radar will spot you

667
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:11,177
and you're dead.

668
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:13,266
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

669
00:49:14,093 --> 00:49:15,311
minimum.

670
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,748
Two and a half minutes.

671
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:22,927
That's because fifth-generation
fighters wait at an air base nearby.

672
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:26,887
In a head-to-head with these
planes in your f-18s, you're dead.

673
00:49:28,454 --> 00:49:31,065
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

674
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,330
before these planes even
have a chance of catching you.

675
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,332
This makes time
your greatest adversary.

676
00:49:39,204 --> 00:49:42,947
You'll fly a route in your nav
system that simulates the canyon.

677
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:45,254
The faster you navigate
this canyon,

678
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:47,710
the harder it'll be to stay under
the radar of these enemy sams.

679
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,693
The tighter the turns,

680
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,477
the more intensely
the force of gravity

681
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:53,566
on your body multiplies...

682
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,437
Compressing your lungs...

683
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:57,874
Forcing the blood
from your brain...

684
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,224
Impairing your judgment
and reaction time.

685
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,661
So for today 's lesson, we' re
gonna take it easy on you.

686
00:50:02,835 --> 00:50:05,838
- 300 feet.
- Three minutes.

687
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:08,928
Good luck.

688
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:19,155
Time to target is one minute 30.

689
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:21,549
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

690
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:22,985
We got to move, coyote.

691
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,422
Copy. Increasing speed.

692
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:26,641
Oh!

693
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:28,859
Oh, shit!

694
00:50:32,081 --> 00:50:33,604
Why are they dead?

695
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:36,433
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a Sam took us out.

696
00:50:36,607 --> 00:50:38,435
No. Why are they dead?

697
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:40,892
I slowed down and didn't give
her a warning. It was my fault.

698
00:50:40,916 --> 00:50:43,851
Was there a reason you didn't communicate
with your team? I was focusing on...

699
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,443
One that their family
will accept at the funeral.

700
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:47,617
None, sir.

701
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,280
Why didn't you
anticipate the turn?

702
00:50:50,404 --> 00:50:51,840
You were briefed on the terrain.

703
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:54,972
Don't tell me.
Tell it to his family.

704
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:02,850
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

705
00:51:03,024 --> 00:51:05,592
Negative, payback.
Increase your speed.

706
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:10,553
You're going too fast, man. No
harm in being ahead of schedule.

707
00:51:12,816 --> 00:51:15,688
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

708
00:51:15,862 --> 00:51:18,386
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

709
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:24,740
What happened?
I flew as fast as I could.

710
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:26,960
Kind of like my ass
depended on it.

711
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:30,311
And you put your team in danger,
and your wing man's dead.

712
00:51:31,486 --> 00:51:33,052
They couldn't keep up.

713
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:41,714
Rooster, we're 20
seconds behind and dropping.

714
00:51:41,888 --> 00:51:44,369
We're fine. Speed is good.

715
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:46,371
Increase to 500 knots.

716
00:51:46,545 --> 00:51:49,156
Negative, Yale. Hold your
speed. rooster, we're late!

717
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:52,028
We 're alive. We' ll make
up time in the straightaway.

718
00:51:52,202 --> 00:51:53,725
We are not gonna make it.

719
00:51:53,899 --> 00:51:56,771
Just trust me. Maintain
your speed. We can make it.

720
00:51:56,945 --> 00:51:59,078
Why are you dead?

721
00:51:59,252 --> 00:52:00,601
You're team leader up there.

722
00:52:00,775 --> 00:52:03,299
Why are you,
why is your team dead?

723
00:52:03,474 --> 00:52:06,041
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

724
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:08,217
A minute late.

725
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,698
He gave enemy aircraft
time to shoot him down.

726
00:52:10,872 --> 00:52:12,873
He is dead. You Don't know that.

727
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:16,181
You're not flying fast enough.
You Don't have a second to waste.

728
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:18,226
We made it to the target.

729
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,360
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

730
00:52:21,534 --> 00:52:24,450
Then it's a dogfight. Against
fifth-generation fighters.

731
00:52:24,624 --> 00:52:27,144
Yeah. We'd still have
a chance. in an f-18.

732
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,673
It's not the plane, sir,
it's the pilot.

733
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:30,978
Exactly!

734
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:40,684
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

735
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,380
You really Don't get it.

736
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,384
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

737
00:52:46,558 --> 00:52:48,430
or a man does not come back.

738
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:50,649
No offense intended.

739
00:52:51,649 --> 00:52:53,869
Yet somehow you always manage.

740
00:52:55,436 --> 00:52:57,089
Look, I Don't mean to criticize.

741
00:52:57,263 --> 00:52:59,352
You're conservative,
that's all.Lieutenant.

742
00:52:59,527 --> 00:53:03,792
We're going into combat, son, on
a level no living pilot's ever seen.

743
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:06,447
Not even him.

744
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:10,320
That's no time to be
thinking about the past.

745
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:16,412
What's that
supposed to mean? Rooster.

746
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:19,217
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

747
00:53:19,241 --> 00:53:21,765
That's enough. Or that Maverick was flying
when his old man...

748
00:53:21,939 --> 00:53:24,246
Lieutenant, that's enough!

749
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,161
That's enough. You son of a bitch!

750
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:27,858
Hey, come on!

751
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:29,948
I'm cool,
I'm cool. Hey, hey.

752
00:53:30,122 --> 00:53:32,360
That 's enough. he' s not cut out
for this mission.

753
00:53:32,384 --> 00:53:34,778
That's enough! You know it.

754
00:53:37,346 --> 00:53:38,390
You know I'm right.

755
00:53:44,832 --> 00:53:45,963
You're all dismissed.

756
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:51,635
Maverick.

757
00:54:53,985 --> 00:54:55,290
It's come back?

758
00:54:55,943 --> 00:54:57,423
No one knows.

759
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,993
There's nothing else
they can do.

760
00:55:02,167 --> 00:55:05,170
Even speaking is painful now.

761
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:12,872
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

762
00:55:32,544 --> 00:55:33,589
Admiral.

763
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:46,340
How's my wing man?

764
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,266
Please, Don't worry about me.

765
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,965
What can I do for you?

766
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:12,538
All right.

767
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:18,501
Well, rooster's still angry
with me about what I did.

768
00:56:20,024 --> 00:56:22,724
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

769
00:56:24,987 --> 00:56:26,641
I hoped he'd forgive me.

770
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,911
The mission is less
than three weeks away.

771
00:56:37,085 --> 00:56:39,174
The kid's not ready.

772
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,487
He doesn't want
what I have to give.

773
00:56:50,663 --> 00:56:51,925
Ice, please,

774
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:54,275
Don't ask me to send
someone else to die.

775
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:55,580
Please Don't...

776
00:56:56,581 --> 00:56:58,018
Don't ask me to send him.

777
00:56:58,192 --> 00:56:59,802
Send me.

778
00:57:31,572 --> 00:57:33,269
I Don't know how.

779
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:48,239
I'm not a teacher, ice.

780
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:52,504
I'm a fighter pilot.

781
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:56,508
A naval aviator.

782
00:57:58,989 --> 00:58:01,078
It's not what I am.

783
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,907
It's who I am.

784
00:58:05,647 --> 00:58:07,431
How do I teach that?

785
00:58:09,346 --> 00:58:12,741
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what rooster wants.

786
00:58:12,915 --> 00:58:14,960
It's not what the Navy wants.

787
00:58:15,134 --> 00:58:17,485
That's why they canned me
the last time.

788
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:23,274
The only reason I'm here is you.

789
00:58:30,628 --> 00:58:32,456
If I send him on this mission,

790
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:35,764
he might never come home.

791
00:58:39,506 --> 00:58:41,639
And if I Don't send him,

792
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:43,684
he'll never forgive me.

793
00:58:46,382 --> 00:58:48,819
Either way,
I could lose him forever.

794
00:58:59,308 --> 00:59:00,309
I know.

795
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:02,485
I know.

796
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:17,282
The Navy needs Maverick.

797
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:22,897
The kid needs Maverick.

798
00:59:23,985 --> 00:59:26,160
That's why I fought for you.

799
00:59:28,205 --> 00:59:30,555
That 's why you' re still here.

800
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:40,261
Thank you, ice,

801
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:42,437
for everything.

802
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:48,703
One last thing.

803
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,097
Who's the better pilot?

804
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:52,576
You or me?

805
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,191
This is a nice moment.
Let's not ruin it.

806
01:00:38,665 --> 01:00:40,275
All right, all right.

807
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:09,042
Yeah!

808
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:03,094
Sir.

809
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:05,008
What is this? This is dogfight football.

810
01:02:05,182 --> 01:02:07,272
Offense and defense
at the same time.

811
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,231
Who's winning?

812
01:02:09,405 --> 01:02:12,103
I think they stopped
keeping score a while ago.

813
01:02:12,277 --> 01:02:15,237
This detachment still has some
training to complete, captain.

814
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:17,500
Every available
minute matters. Yes, sir.

815
01:02:17,674 --> 01:02:19,806
So why are we out here
playing games?

816
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,852
You said to create a team, sir.

817
01:02:23,331 --> 01:02:24,636
There's your team.

818
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:06,778
Should I go?
Before Amelia gets back?

819
01:04:06,952 --> 01:04:09,259
She'll be at her
friend's house tonight. Oh, good.

820
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:14,090
You and Amelia, you seem...

821
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:19,182
A lot closer
than when I last saw you.

822
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,792
Yeah. Yeah, we are. How do you manage?

823
01:04:23,924 --> 01:04:26,188
Well,

824
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,756
you know, she always wanted more
freedom than I thought she was ready for.

825
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:32,672
Hmm. Where'd she
get that from, I wonder?

826
01:04:36,285 --> 01:04:37,721
I guess I realized

827
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:40,723
I also had to trust her.

828
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:45,206
Let her make some of her
own mistakes sometimes.

829
01:04:47,295 --> 01:04:49,123
Not an easy choice.Mmm.

830
01:04:53,344 --> 01:04:55,303
Is that what happened
with rooster?

831
01:04:59,003 --> 01:05:01,744
I pulled his papers
from the naval academy.

832
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:06,488
Took years off his career.

833
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:13,799
Why?

834
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:20,196
His mother never wanted him to
fly, not after what happened to goose.

835
01:05:23,025 --> 01:05:26,333
She made me promise
before she died, so...

836
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,422
Does rooster know that?

837
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:35,037
He will always resent me
for what I did.

838
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,476
Why should he resent her too?

839
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:46,090
Not an easy choice.Hmm.

840
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:51,139
I was trying to be
the father he lost.

841
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:55,187
I just...

842
01:05:58,103 --> 01:06:00,235
I wish I would've
done it better.

843
01:06:02,498 --> 01:06:05,327
But the truth is...

844
01:06:07,895 --> 01:06:09,723
I didn't think he was ready.

845
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:15,032
Is he ready now?

846
01:06:17,818 --> 01:06:19,906
Mom, I'm home!

847
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,997
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

848
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:26,826
Karen's sick.
And I've got homework to do.

849
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,350
I should
go. you should go.

850
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:32,701
Have you had dinner yet? not yet.
You wanna go out?

851
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:35,748
No, it's okay.
I'll make you something.

852
01:06:35,922 --> 01:06:37,706
I'll be down in a sec!

853
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,838
Wait! Not that way. What?

854
01:06:41,492 --> 01:06:43,624
Look, I have an example to set.

855
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:46,148
I can't be bringing guys
home on a first date.

856
01:06:46,323 --> 01:06:47,672
This is not our first date.

857
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:50,370
You know what I mean.

858
01:06:53,112 --> 01:06:54,157
Okay.

859
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:57,335
Fine.

860
01:06:57,509 --> 01:06:59,597
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

861
01:06:59,771 --> 01:07:01,120
We'll see.

862
01:07:01,294 --> 01:07:03,296
No. No, I mean it.

863
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:05,385
I'm never gonna leave you again.

864
01:07:07,387 --> 01:07:08,954
Oh, shut up.

865
01:07:09,128 --> 01:07:10,999
Go on, get out of here.

866
01:07:24,534 --> 01:07:26,492
Just Don't
break her heart again.

867
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:39,591
Good morning.

868
01:07:39,765 --> 01:07:41,645
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

869
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:44,160
will be operational
earlier than expected.

870
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:48,077
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

871
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:51,168
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

872
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:54,911
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

873
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:57,782
Sir, no one here has successfully
flown a low-level course.

874
01:07:57,956 --> 01:07:59,871
Nevertheless, you've
been ordered to move on.

875
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:02,091
Captain.

876
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:07,444
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

877
01:08:07,618 --> 01:08:09,446
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

878
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,274
It's a pop-up strike
with a steep dive,

879
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:14,321
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

880
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:16,888
Two pairs of f-18s will fly

881
01:08:17,062 --> 01:08:18,672
in a welded wing formation.

882
01:08:18,846 --> 01:08:22,545
Teamwork. Precise coordination
of these aircraft is essential

883
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:25,331
to both the mission's success
and your survival.

884
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:28,116
As you know, the plant rests
between two mountains.

885
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:33,208
On final approach, you'll
invert directly into a steep dive.

886
01:08:33,382 --> 01:08:36,037
This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude

887
01:08:37,254 --> 01:08:39,039
and the only possible
attack angle.

888
01:08:42,825 --> 01:08:47,743
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

889
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:49,616
The two-seat aircraft
will paint the target

890
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:52,096
with a laser bull's-eye.

891
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:54,055
The first pair
will breach the reactor

892
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:57,797
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

893
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:00,843
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

894
01:09:01,017 --> 01:09:02,454
That's miracle number one.

895
01:09:04,804 --> 01:09:07,546
The second team
will deliver the kill shot...

896
01:09:08,982 --> 01:09:10,766
And destroy the target.

897
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:13,378
That's miracle number two.

898
01:09:14,770 --> 01:09:16,989
If either team
misses the target...

899
01:09:19,295 --> 01:09:21,472
That's a miss.
The mission is a failure.

900
01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:22,995
Damn it!

901
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:25,476
Egress
is a steep high-g climb out

902
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,216
to avoid hitting this mountain.

903
01:09:29,654 --> 01:09:32,831
A steep climb at that speed,
you 're pulling at least eight g' s.

904
01:09:33,005 --> 01:09:34,441
Nine, minimum.

905
01:09:34,615 --> 01:09:37,225
The stress limit
of the f-18's airframe is 7.5.

906
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,880
That's the accepted limit.

907
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:41,055
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

908
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:44,450
even if it means
bending your airframe.

909
01:09:44,624 --> 01:09:48,542
You 'll be pulling so hard, you' ll
weigh close to 2,000 pounds,

910
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:51,545
your skull
crushing your spine...

911
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:54,679
Your lungs imploding like an
elephant's sitting on your chest,

912
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:58,116
fighting with everything you
have just to keep from blacking out.

913
01:10:00,335 --> 01:10:02,816
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

914
01:10:03,774 --> 01:10:06,603
This is coffin corner.

915
01:10:06,777 --> 01:10:09,475
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

916
01:10:09,649 --> 01:10:13,087
you'll climb straight up into enemy
radar while losing all of your airspeed.

917
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:16,394
Within seconds, you'll be
fired upon by enemy sams.

918
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:20,703
You've all faced sustained
g's before, but this...

919
01:10:20,877 --> 01:10:24,402
This is gonna take you and
your aircraft to the breaking point.

920
01:10:24,576 --> 01:10:27,231
Sir, is this even achievable?

921
01:10:27,405 --> 01:10:29,538
The answer to that question

922
01:10:29,712 --> 01:10:31,801
will come down
to the pilot in the box.

923
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:43,813
Talk to me, Bob. We are 12 seconds
late on target.

924
01:10:43,987 --> 01:10:46,555
We gotta move!
We gotta move! Copy. Try to stay with me.

925
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:51,864
Huh? Wait, who's that?

926
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,763
Blue team, you've been spotted.

927
01:10:54,824 --> 01:10:57,216
Shit, it's Maverick. What
the hell is he doing here?

928
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:00,393
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue team, what are you gonna do?

929
01:11:00,568 --> 01:11:03,658
He 's 20 miles left. Ten o' clock.
700 knots closure.

930
01:11:03,832 --> 01:11:05,616
Your call.
What do you want to do?

931
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:08,401
Continue. We're close.
Stay on target.

932
01:11:08,576 --> 01:11:11,709
He's swinging around
to the north! Stand by for pop-up.

933
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:14,538
Be ready on that laser,
Bob.Copy. I'm on it.

934
01:11:16,191 --> 01:11:17,801
Blue team,
bandit is still closing.

935
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:19,063
Popping now.

936
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:27,376
Talk to me, Bob.
Where's Maverick?

937
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,552
He's five miles out.
He's coming fast.

938
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:38,647
Target 's in sight. Where' s my laser, Bob?

939
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:42,086
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

940
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,088
We're out of time.
I'm dropping blind.

941
01:11:47,309 --> 01:11:48,745
Damn it, missed!

942
01:11:59,755 --> 01:12:01,475
That's tone.

943
01:12:01,627 --> 01:12:03,747
Maverick's got
missile lock on us. Shit! We're dead.

944
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,066
Blue team, that's a fail.

945
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,241
Level out, coyote.

946
01:12:09,896 --> 01:12:11,811
Coyote? Do you copy?

947
01:12:14,639 --> 01:12:16,554
Coyote, come in.

948
01:12:16,728 --> 01:12:18,556
Coyote, level wings.

949
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,253
Oh, god. He's in g-loc.

950
01:12:20,427 --> 01:12:23,561
Coyote? Coyote?

951
01:12:23,735 --> 01:12:25,911
He 's gonna burn in! I' m going after him.

952
01:12:29,131 --> 01:12:31,656
Come on. Give me tone,
give me tone, give me tone.

953
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,875
Snap out
of it, coyote. Come on! Come on!

954
01:12:37,922 --> 01:12:40,621
Come on, coyote, come on.
Come on!

955
01:12:40,795 --> 01:12:42,884
- Damn it! Coyote!
- Coyote! pull up!

956
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,625
Coyote! Coyote!
Pull up! Pull up!

957
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:52,589
Coyote, you okay? You okay?

958
01:12:52,763 --> 01:12:55,460
I 'm okay. I' m good.

959
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:59,290
Good. Good.
That's enough for today.

960
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:02,598
That was close.

961
01:13:02,772 --> 01:13:04,164
Too close.

962
01:13:05,078 --> 01:13:07,167
Bird strike! Bird strike!

963
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,995
Bird strike!

964
01:13:11,824 --> 01:13:14,478
Phoenix,
left engine's on fire! Climbing.

965
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,874
Throttling back. Shutting
off fuel to left engine.

966
01:13:19,048 --> 01:13:20,658
Extinguishing fire.

967
01:13:22,138 --> 01:13:23,966
Right engine is out!

968
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,820
It's still spinning.
Trying to restart it.

969
01:13:28,318 --> 01:13:29,319
Phoenix, it's on fire.

970
01:13:29,493 --> 01:13:30,929
Don't start... throttling up.

971
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:33,757
Oh, my god.

972
01:13:37,153 --> 01:13:39,503
We 're on fire! We' re on fire! Damn it!

973
01:13:39,677 --> 01:13:42,419
Engine fire.
Right. Extinguishing right engine.

974
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,554
Phoenix, Bob,
punch out, punch out!

975
01:13:47,729 --> 01:13:49,861
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

976
01:13:50,035 --> 01:13:51,994
Flight controls. I can't control it.

977
01:13:52,168 --> 01:13:54,624
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

978
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:57,172
You can't save it.
Eject, eject!

979
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:58,564
Eject, eject, eject!

980
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:01,437
Altitude. Altitude.

981
01:14:22,979 --> 01:14:25,852
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob in
the hospital overnight for observation.

982
01:14:26,026 --> 01:14:27,549
They're gonna be okay.

983
01:14:31,595 --> 01:14:32,945
That's good.

984
01:14:36,384 --> 01:14:38,038
I've never lost a wing man.

985
01:14:38,778 --> 01:14:40,518
You're lucky.

986
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,433
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

987
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:46,873
There will be others.

988
01:14:49,658 --> 01:14:51,659
Easy for you to say.
No wife.

989
01:14:53,574 --> 01:14:55,576
No kids.

990
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:58,144
Nobody to mourn you
when you burn in.

991
01:15:01,364 --> 01:15:02,714
Go home.

992
01:15:03,845 --> 01:15:05,325
Just get some sleep.

993
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:09,982
Why'd you pull my papers
at the academy?

994
01:15:10,156 --> 01:15:11,765
Why did you stand in my way?

995
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:15,595
You weren't ready.

996
01:15:15,769 --> 01:15:17,075
Ready for what?

997
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:20,469
Huh?
Ready to fly like you? No.

998
01:15:20,643 --> 01:15:22,167
Ready to forget the book.

999
01:15:22,341 --> 01:15:24,996
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

1000
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:27,781
You think up there,
you're dead. Believe me.

1001
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:30,740
My dad believed in you.

1002
01:15:33,482 --> 01:15:35,920
I'm not gonna make
the same mistake.

1003
01:15:41,577 --> 01:15:43,101
Maverick.

1004
01:15:53,675 --> 01:15:56,548
Ready, aim, fire.

1005
01:16:01,248 --> 01:16:02,467
Ready,

1006
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:04,382
aim,

1007
01:16:04,556 --> 01:16:05,862
fire.

1008
01:16:15,914 --> 01:16:17,133
Ready,

1009
01:16:18,177 --> 01:16:19,439
aim,

1010
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:20,919
fire.

1011
01:16:54,734 --> 01:16:57,825
I can only imagine what
you must be feeling right now.

1012
01:16:57,999 --> 01:17:01,350
Take some time.
Whatever you need.

1013
01:17:01,524 --> 01:17:03,884
I appreciate that, sir, but
there is no time. The mission...

1014
01:17:03,961 --> 01:17:06,007
I'll be taking over
the training from here.

1015
01:17:07,008 --> 01:17:08,008
Sir?

1016
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:11,324
We both know you didn't
want this job, captain.

1017
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:13,679
Sir, they're not ready. It was your job
to get them ready.

1018
01:17:13,752 --> 01:17:17,147
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1019
01:17:17,321 --> 01:17:20,020
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1020
01:17:21,064 --> 01:17:23,110
Sir... you're grounded, captain.

1021
01:17:23,284 --> 01:17:24,807
Permanently.

1022
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:30,160
Sir... that is all.

1023
01:17:48,438 --> 01:17:49,482
I heard.

1024
01:17:51,745 --> 01:17:52,920
I'm sorry.

1025
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:55,488
What are you gonna do?

1026
01:17:56,619 --> 01:17:57,925
Ice is gone.

1027
01:18:00,493 --> 01:18:02,190
What choice do I have?

1028
01:18:03,496 --> 01:18:05,890
You'll have to find a
way back on your own.

1029
01:18:06,064 --> 01:18:07,326
No, penny.

1030
01:18:09,109 --> 01:18:10,458
I'm out.

1031
01:18:12,199 --> 01:18:13,461
This is over.

1032
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:15,072
Pete.

1033
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:17,422
If you lost
your wing man up there,

1034
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:19,903
you'd keep fighting.

1035
01:18:20,077 --> 01:18:21,339
You wouldn't just give up.

1036
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,125
Those are your pilots.

1037
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:28,172
If anything happens to them,

1038
01:18:28,346 --> 01:18:30,478
you'll never forgive yourself.

1039
01:18:34,526 --> 01:18:36,397
I Don't know what to do.

1040
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:41,968
But you'll find a way.

1041
01:18:44,405 --> 01:18:45,624
I know you will.

1042
01:18:47,799 --> 01:18:50,106
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1043
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:53,239
And as of today, there are
new mission parameters.

1044
01:18:53,413 --> 01:18:55,894
Time to target
is now four minutes.

1045
01:18:56,068 --> 01:18:58,505
You'll be entering the
valley level at reduced speed.

1046
01:18:58,679 --> 01:19:01,595
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1047
01:19:01,769 --> 01:19:04,381
Sir, won't we be giving
their planes time to intercept?

1048
01:19:04,555 --> 01:19:07,186
Well, lieutenant, you have a
fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1049
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,212
What are the odds of surviving a
head-on collision with a mountain?

1050
01:19:10,386 --> 01:19:12,736
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1051
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,346
level with the north wall.

1052
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,653
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1053
01:19:16,827 --> 01:19:18,655
but you will avoid
the high-g climb out.

1054
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:21,006
We'll be sitting ducks
for enemy missiles.

1055
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:27,664
Who the hell is that?

1056
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:32,234
Maverick to range
control. Entering point Alpha.

1057
01:19:32,408 --> 01:19:34,627
Confirm green range.

1058
01:19:34,801 --> 01:19:38,675
Uh, Maverick, range
control, uh, green range is confirmed.

1059
01:19:38,849 --> 01:19:42,157
I Don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.

1060
01:19:42,331 --> 01:19:43,985
Well, I'm going anyway.

1061
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,334
Nice.

1062
01:19:45,508 --> 01:19:47,204
Setting time to target:

1063
01:19:47,378 --> 01:19:49,119
Two minutes 15 seconds.

1064
01:19:49,293 --> 01:19:50,991
2:15? That's impossible.

1065
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:53,689
Final attack point.
Maverick's inbound.

1066
01:21:31,349 --> 01:21:34,569
Popping in three, two, one.

1067
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:02,335
Bombs away.

1068
01:22:20,223 --> 01:22:22,399
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1069
01:22:23,095 --> 01:22:24,704
Yes.

1070
01:22:27,577 --> 01:22:28,621
Damn.

1071
01:22:41,504 --> 01:22:44,462
You have put me
in a difficult position, captain.

1072
01:22:44,636 --> 01:22:48,291
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1073
01:22:48,465 --> 01:22:50,728
Perhaps the only way
it can be survived.

1074
01:22:51,903 --> 01:22:53,688
On the other hand,

1075
01:22:53,862 --> 01:22:56,604
you did it by stealing a
multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1076
01:22:56,778 --> 01:22:59,607
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1077
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:04,001
Iceman is no longer here
to protect you.

1078
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:06,700
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1079
01:23:06,874 --> 01:23:08,615
and dishonorably discharged.

1080
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:10,792
So what do I do?

1081
01:23:11,836 --> 01:23:13,011
Risk the lives of my pilots

1082
01:23:13,186 --> 01:23:14,926
and perhaps the success
of this mission

1083
01:23:16,406 --> 01:23:17,407
or...

1084
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:20,410
Risk my career

1085
01:23:21,498 --> 01:23:23,239
by appointing you team leader?

1086
01:23:27,242 --> 01:23:31,290
Sir... I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, captain.

1087
01:25:12,126 --> 01:25:13,737
Talk to me, goose.

1088
01:25:17,088 --> 01:25:18,568
Captain Mitchell!

1089
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:27,227
You're where you belong.

1090
01:25:32,102 --> 01:25:33,625
Make us proud.

1091
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,869
It has been an honor
flying with you.

1092
01:26:03,174 --> 01:26:07,049
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1093
01:26:07,223 --> 01:26:10,618
This is a very specific mission.

1094
01:26:10,792 --> 01:26:13,969
My choice is a reflection
of that and nothing more.

1095
01:26:14,143 --> 01:26:15,971
Choose your two foxtrot teams.

1096
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:19,191
Payback and fanboy.

1097
01:26:20,236 --> 01:26:21,584
Phoenix and Bob.

1098
01:26:25,893 --> 01:26:27,590
And your wing man.

1099
01:26:31,942 --> 01:26:32,987
Rooster.

1100
01:26:37,557 --> 01:26:39,733
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1101
01:26:39,907 --> 01:26:42,778
for any reserve role
that's required.

1102
01:26:43,649 --> 01:26:44,824
Dismissed.

1103
01:26:52,658 --> 01:26:55,487
Your target
is a clear and present threat.

1104
01:26:57,184 --> 01:27:00,708
A secret uranium enrichment
site under rogue state control.

1105
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,711
It's an underground bunker,

1106
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,670
tucked between
these two mountains.

1107
01:27:06,672 --> 01:27:09,849
Your route of ingress is heavily
defended by surface-to-air missiles

1108
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:12,460
backed up
by fifth-generation fighters.

1109
01:27:12,634 --> 01:27:15,289
Once your f-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1110
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:17,378
tomahawk missiles
from the USS Leyte Gulf

1111
01:27:17,552 --> 01:27:21,120
will launch a synchronized
strike on the enemy's airfield here.

1112
01:27:22,469 --> 01:27:24,602
This will knock out
their runway.

1113
01:27:26,473 --> 01:27:29,781
But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.

1114
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:32,740
The moment those tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1115
01:27:33,959 --> 01:27:35,221
Your time to target

1116
01:27:35,395 --> 01:27:38,006
will be two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1117
01:27:39,703 --> 01:27:41,618
Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed

1118
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:44,403
to any aircraft
the tomahawks may have missed.

1119
01:27:47,797 --> 01:27:50,190
This is what you've all
been training for.

1120
01:27:52,149 --> 01:27:53,629
Come home safely.

1121
01:28:08,295 --> 01:28:10,080
You give 'em hell!

1122
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:23,701
Sir.

1123

1172
01:33:19,725 --> 01:33:21,466
Let's not take it for granted.

01:33:48,232 --> 01:33:50,471
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1179
01:33:50,495 --> 01:33:53,193
Where the hell'd
they come from? Long-range patrol?

1180
01:33:58,197 --> 01:33:59,895

They Don't know we're here.

1183
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:06,379
The second those tomahawks
hit the air base,

1184
01:34:06,553 --> 01:34:08,642
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1185
01:34:08,817 --> 01:34:11,384
We have to get there before
they do. Increase speed.

1186
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:15,039

Bandits are switching
course to defend the target.

1193
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:45,722

1196
01:34:59,387 --> 01:35:00,431
Heads up, Phoenix.

1197
01:35:04,218 --> 01:35:05,349
Whoa!

1198
01:35:10,267 --> 01:35:12,878
Sir, bandits

1199
01:35:13,052 --> 01:35:14,531
Daggers are one minute
from target.

1200
01:35:14,705 --> 01:35:16,969
Come on, rooster.
Move it or lose it.

1201
01:35:19,275 --> 01:35:22,017
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really gotta move.

1202
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:24,019
If we Don't increase our speed
right now,

1203
01:35:24,193 --> 01:35:26,848
those bandits are gonna be waiting
for us when we reach the target.

1204
01:35:28,589 --> 01:35:29,851
Talk to me, dad.

1205
01:35:31,157 --> 01:35:32,592
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1206
01:35:32,766 --> 01:35:34,811
Don't think, just do.

1207
01:35:43,299 --> 01:35:44,953
Jesus, rooster, not that fast!

1208
01:35:45,127 --> 01:35:47,390
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1209
01:35:51,481 --> 01:35:53,178
Damn, rooster, take it easy.

1210
01:35:53,352 --> 01:35:56,442
Sir, dagger two is reengaging.

1211
01:35:56,616 --> 01:35:58,966
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

01:36:13,197 --> 01:36:14,589

Holy shit! Shit!

1217
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:19,768
Payback, you with me? Right behind you.

1218
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,641
Phoenix, stand by
for pop-up strike.

1219
01:36:22,815 --> 01:36:24,077
Dagger three in position.

1220
01:36:25,035 --> 01:36:27,472
Popping in three, two, one.

1221
01:36:55,499 --> 01:36:57,762
Get me eyes
on that target, Bob. Dagger three.

1222
01:36:59,155 --> 01:37:00,895
Stand by, mav. Come on, Bob, come on.

01:37:38,454 --> 01:37:39,977
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1230
01:37:40,151 --> 01:37:42,675
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser!

1231
01:37:42,849 --> 01:37:44,547
Shit! Dead eye, dead eye, dead eye!

1232
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:46,921
Come on, guys, we're
running out of time. Get it online!

1233
01:37:46,983 --> 01:37:48,482
I'm trying! Come on, fanboy!

1237
01:38:04,043 --> 01:38:05,957
Wait!

01:38:19,013 --> 01:38:20,947
Bull's-eye,

1239
01:38:24,758 --> 01:38:25,976
Miracle number two.

1240
01:38:26,151 --> 01:38:27,674
Now they're in coffin corner.

1241
01:38:27,848 --> 01:38:29,936
We're not out of this yet.

1242
01:38:31,721 --> 01:38:33,158
Here it comes.

1243

Shit, I'm out of flares!

1266
01:39:56,238 --> 01:39:58,544
Rooster, evade, evade!

1267
01:39:58,718 --> 01:40:00,938
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

1268
01:40:11,034 --> 01:40:12,688

01:40:25,048 --> 01:40:27,182
Dagger one, come in! I
didn't see a parachute.

1275
01:40:27,356 --> 01:40:28,921
We have to circle back.

Comanche.
Bandits inbound. Single group, hot.

1277

You have bandits
headed for you. What about Maverick?

1281
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,650
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn f-18.

1282
01:40:47,765 --> 01:40:50,551
Dagger spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1283
01:40:52,857 --> 01:40:53,989
Negative, spare.

1284
01:40:55,033 --> 01:40:56,165
Launch search and rescue.

1285
01:40:56,339 --> 01:40:57,621
Negative.
Not with bandits in the air.

1286
01:40:57,645 --> 01:40:59,100
But, sir,
Maverick is still out there.

1287
01:40:59,124 --> 01:41:01,214
We are not losing
anyone else today.

1288
01:41:03,128 --> 01:41:04,565
Get 'em home now.

1289
01:41:04,739 --> 01:41:07,175
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1290
01:41:07,349 --> 01:41:09,395
Repeat, do not engage.

1291
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:12,528
Dagger two,
return to carrier. Acknowledge.

1292
01:41:12,702 --> 01:41:13,747
Acknowledge.

1293
01:41:13,921 --> 01:41:15,923
Rooster,
those bandits are closing.

1294
01:41:16,097 --> 01:41:17,141
We can't go back.

1295
01:41:17,316 --> 01:41:20,232
Rooster, he's gone.

1296
01:41:21,885 --> 01:41:23,366
Maverick's gone.

1297
01:42:53,843 --> 01:42:54,844
Oh, no, no.

1298
01:43:01,546 --> 01:43:03,069
Dagger two is hit.

1299
01:43:04,201 --> 01:43:05,332
Dagger two is hit.

1300
01:43:06,898 --> 01:43:08,422
Dagger two, come in.

1301
01:43:09,988 --> 01:43:11,773
Dagger two, do you copy?

1302
01:43:13,035 --> 01:43:14,776
Dagger two, come in.

1303
01:43:40,018 --> 01:43:41,193
You all right?

1304
01:43:41,368 --> 01:43:42,934
Yeah, I'm good.
You all right?

1305
01:43:45,545 --> 01:43:47,808
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

1306
01:43:47,982 --> 01:43:49,982
What am I doing here? You think I took
that missile

1307
01:43:50,071 --> 01:43:51,507
so you could be
down here with me?

1308
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:53,335
You should be back
on the carrier by now!

1309
01:43:53,509 --> 01:43:55,163
I saved your life!

1310
01:43:55,337 --> 01:43:58,384
I saved your life.
That's the whole point.

1311
01:43:58,558 --> 01:44:00,211
What the hell
were you even thinking?

1312
01:44:00,386 --> 01:44:02,475
You told me not to think!

1313
01:44:19,143 --> 01:44:20,275
Well,

1314
01:44:21,842 --> 01:44:22,973
it's good to see you.

1315
01:44:25,584 --> 01:44:27,063
It's good to see you too.

1316
01:44:31,067 --> 01:44:32,504
So what's the plan?

1317
01:44:43,644 --> 01:44:44,863
You're not serious.

1318
01:45:00,182 --> 01:45:02,010
You've got to be shitting me.

1319
01:45:03,968 --> 01:45:05,578
An f-14?

1320
01:45:05,752 --> 01:45:07,493
I shot down three migs
in one of those.

1321
01:45:07,667 --> 01:45:10,061
We Don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1322
01:45:12,759 --> 01:45:14,719
Let's find out. Mav!

1323
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:17,591
Okay.

1324
01:45:27,165 --> 01:45:30,255
There's guys up there, mav.Yeah.

1325
01:45:30,429 --> 01:45:33,432
There's more over there. okay.

1326
01:45:33,606 --> 01:45:35,887
Let's start
running. yeah, run. Run.

1327
01:45:45,269 --> 01:45:48,185
Once... once I give you
the signal for air,

1328
01:45:48,359 --> 01:45:50,883
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1329
01:45:51,057 --> 01:45:52,537
When the engine starts,

1330
01:45:52,711 --> 01:45:54,871
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1331
01:45:54,974 --> 01:45:56,541
You understand? Yeah.

1332
01:45:58,804 --> 01:45:59,805
Yes!

1333
01:46:01,677 --> 01:46:03,852
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1334
01:46:11,774 --> 01:46:13,819
Okay. Wow.

1335
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:16,822
It's been a minute, huh, mav?

1336
01:46:45,719 --> 01:46:48,635
Oh, my god.
This thing is so old.

1337
01:46:49,636 --> 01:46:50,637
All right.

1338
01:46:55,729 --> 01:46:57,295
Canopy? Clear.

1339
01:47:15,487 --> 01:47:17,925
Both runways are cratered.

1340
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:20,188
How we gonna get this
museum piece in the air?

1341
01:47:30,589 --> 01:47:31,981
Why are the wings
coming out, mav?

1342
01:47:38,684 --> 01:47:41,294
Mav, this is a taxiway,
not a runway.

1343
01:47:41,468 --> 01:47:44,776
This is a very short
taxiway, mav.

1344
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:46,168
Just hang on.

1345
01:47:47,474 --> 01:47:48,866
Holy shit!

1346
01:47:54,915 --> 01:47:56,134
Come on, come on, come on.

1347
01:47:56,308 --> 01:47:57,918
Needle's alive. Come on.

1348
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:02,922
Mav? That's it. Come on, come on!

1349
01:48:03,096 --> 01:48:04,141
All right.

1350
01:48:05,055 --> 01:48:07,058
Mav! Here we go.

1351
01:48:08,494 --> 01:48:09,930
Holy shit.

1352
01:48:23,726 --> 01:48:26,685
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from rooster's esat.

1353
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:28,687
But there seems to be
a malfunction.

1354
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:30,210
Have you lost him? No, sir.

1355
01:48:31,385 --> 01:48:32,648
He's supersonic.

1356
01:48:33,344 --> 01:48:34,388
He's airborne.

1357
01:48:35,607 --> 01:48:37,783
In what? Sir.

1358
01:48:37,957 --> 01:48:42,134
Over watch reports an f-14 tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1359
01:48:43,092 --> 01:48:45,660
Can 't be. It can' t be!

1360
01:48:47,313 --> 01:48:48,358
Maverick.

1361
01:48:50,621 --> 01:48:52,841
Okay, rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1362
01:48:53,015 --> 01:48:54,625
I'm working on it.

1363
01:48:54,799 --> 01:48:57,933
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1364
01:48:58,107 --> 01:49:00,935
What do I do?
Talk me through it. Okay, first the radio.

1365
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:02,937
Throw the, uh...

1366
01:49:03,112 --> 01:49:06,332
The uhf-2 circuit breaker.
Try that.

1367
01:49:06,506 --> 01:49:09,379
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1368
01:49:09,553 --> 01:49:11,393
I Don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1369
01:49:11,555 --> 01:49:13,035
I'll figure it out.

1370
01:49:16,386 --> 01:49:18,562
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1371
01:49:23,871 --> 01:49:25,002
What do we do?

1372
01:49:25,873 --> 01:49:28,005
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1373
01:49:28,179 --> 01:49:30,442
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1374
01:49:32,227 --> 01:49:34,098
Well, here they come.

1375
01:49:34,272 --> 01:49:37,362
What's your plan? Just put your mask on.

1376
01:49:38,624 --> 01:49:40,930
Remember,
we're on the same team.

1377
01:49:43,628 --> 01:49:45,456
Just wave and smile.

1378
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:47,720
Just wave and smile.

1379
01:49:54,857 --> 01:49:56,554
What's that signal?
What's he saying?

1380
01:49:56,729 --> 01:50:00,340
No idea.
I have no idea what he's saying.

1381
01:50:00,514 --> 01:50:03,823
What about that one? Any
idea? No, never seen that one either.

1382
01:50:07,217 --> 01:50:10,960
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving
into weapons envelope.

1383
01:50:11,787 --> 01:50:13,441
All right, listen up.

1384
01:50:13,615 --> 01:50:16,052
When I tell you, you grab
those rings above your head.

1385
01:50:16,226 --> 01:50:17,793
That's the ejection handle.

1386
01:50:19,011 --> 01:50:21,013
Mav, can we outrun these guys?

1387
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:23,842
Not their missiles and guns.

1388
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:30,370
Then it's a dogfight.

1389
01:50:30,544 --> 01:50:33,373
An f-14 against
fifth-gen fighters?

1390
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:37,116
It's not the plane,
it's the pilot.

1391
01:50:38,725 --> 01:50:40,640
You'd go after 'em
if I wasn't here.

1392
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:42,990
But you are here.

1393
01:50:43,774 --> 01:50:45,123
Come on, mav.

1394
01:50:46,298 --> 01:50:47,473
Don't think.

1395
01:50:48,691 --> 01:50:49,780
Just do.

1396
01:51:05,404 --> 01:51:07,362
Tell me when you see
smoke in the air.

1397
01:51:11,758 --> 01:51:13,804
Smoke in the air!
Smoke in the air! Hang on.

1398
01:51:16,676 --> 01:51:19,156
Yeah, mav! Splash one!
Splash one!

1399
01:51:24,509 --> 01:51:26,293
Here comes another one.

1400
01:51:28,948 --> 01:51:30,994
Rooster, flares!
Now, now, now!

1401
01:51:34,432 --> 01:51:35,694
Splitting the throttles.

1402
01:51:37,826 --> 01:51:38,957
Coming around.

1403
01:51:43,309 --> 01:51:45,149
Give me tone, give me tone.

1404
01:51:45,268 --> 01:51:47,444
You got him, mav!
You got him! Taking the shot.

1405
01:51:53,406 --> 01:51:54,712
What the...

1406
01:51:55,714 --> 01:51:57,846
Holy shit!
What the fuck was that?

1407
01:51:59,238 --> 01:52:01,414
Hang on. We gotta get low.

1408
01:52:01,588 --> 01:52:03,852
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1409
01:52:05,984 --> 01:52:06,984
Here he comes!

1410
01:52:19,736 --> 01:52:21,564
Talk to me, rooster.
Where is he?

1411
01:52:21,738 --> 01:52:23,392
He's still on us!

1412
01:52:30,573 --> 01:52:32,662
We took a hit! We took a hit! Damn it!

1413
01:52:37,753 --> 01:52:40,060
Come on, mav.
Do some of that pilot shit. Brace yourself.

1414
01:52:50,591 --> 01:52:51,679
Holy shit.

1415
01:52:58,729 --> 01:53:00,689
I
Got tone. Taking the shot.

1416
01:53:04,997 --> 01:53:06,259
Damn it!

1417
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,958
Out of missiles.
Switching to guns.

1418
01:53:15,832 --> 01:53:16,964
Come on, mav, come on.

1419
01:53:19,662 --> 01:53:21,273
You got him, mav! It's not over yet.

1420
01:53:26,017 --> 01:53:27,844
One last chance. You can do this.

1421
01:53:28,976 --> 01:53:30,847
Come on, Maverick.

1422
01:53:40,291 --> 01:53:42,206
Yes! Splash two!

1423
01:53:53,261 --> 01:53:55,132
Mav, I got the radio on.Outstanding.

1424
01:53:55,306 --> 01:53:57,090
Get us in touch
with the boat. Copy that.

1425
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,659
Oh, my god.

1426
01:54:02,661 --> 01:54:04,315
Where the hell is this guy?

1427
01:54:05,664 --> 01:54:07,231
He's on our nose.

1428
01:54:10,016 --> 01:54:11,887
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1429
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:16,326
Smoke in the air!
Rooster, flares!

1430
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:20,156
That was close.

1431
01:54:22,636 --> 01:54:24,551
We're out of flares, mav.

1432
01:54:28,773 --> 01:54:30,731
Shit, he's already on us.

1433
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:37,259
This is not good.

1434
01:54:45,441 --> 01:54:47,399
We took another hit! No, no, no, no, no!

1435
01:54:52,188 --> 01:54:54,406
We can't take much more of this.

1436
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:56,260
We can't outrun this guy.
We got to eject.

1437
01:54:56,408 --> 01:54:57,757
What? We need altitude.

1438
01:54:57,931 --> 01:54:59,933
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1439
01:55:00,108 --> 01:55:02,023
Mav, wait! Rooster,

Maverick is downwind.
No front landing gear.

1455
01:56:30,934 --> 01:56:33,197
No tail hook. Pull the cable
and raise the barricade.

1456
01:56:33,371 --> 01:56:35,416

1463
01:58:21,257 --> 01:58:22,519

Uh, she took Amelia
on a sailing trip.

1474
01:59:58,046 --> 02:00:00,222
Did she say when she'd be back?

1475
02:00:00,397 --> 02:00:01,876
You know, she didn't.
