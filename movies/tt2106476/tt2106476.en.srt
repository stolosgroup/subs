00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,313
They're going in!
Wait for me, for fuck's sake!

3
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:26,277
Come on, for fuck's sake.
You're so slow! Hop on.

4
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:33,899
They're betting 1200 on
who jumps in the lake first.

5
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:38,900
Come on. It's so cold.

6
00:00:40,142 --> 00:00:43,353
Wait for me, for fuck's sake!

7
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:50,400
- Go. Jump in!
- No, I don't want to.

8
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:57,350
It's freezing.

9
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,525
Shit, I have a cramp.

10
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:23,027
- Fucking hell!
- Coming!

11
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:38,730
Put him in the recovery position.

12
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,268
Pump his chest a little.

13
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,024
Don't fuck him up!

14
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:51,400
- Did you check the eel traps?
- I want 600. I came second.

15
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:54,563
There's hot toddy in the car.
Come on, boys.

16
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:15,526
<font color="#cfbf7e">THE HUNT</font>

17
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,899
Something fishy's going on here.

18
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:15,521
Oh, it's you, Pelle!
Are you alone?

19
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:21,691
- Get him! Get him!
- You're too many!

20
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:27,446
Watch out! I'm dangerous.
This is my new weapon, Pelle.

21
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:36,442
- Hang up your clothes.
- I have to go number two.

22
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,938
Lucas can help you, then.

23
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,228
Would you please help him?
All his clothes come off.

24
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:47,734
Is jumping such a great idea?

25
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:03,357
- I'm done.
- Can you handle it yourself?

26
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:09,106
- Hello! Wipe.
- Hey, watch your tone.

27
00:04:09,227 --> 00:04:12,356
Come here.

28
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:15,108
And soap.

29
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:19,613
Come on.

30
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:26,103
Hi, Klara. Something wrong?

31
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:31,110
- I'm lost.
- Oh. Where's Mum and Dad?

32
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:35,695
At home.
I forgot to look where I was going.

33
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:39,438
All of a sudden I was here.

34
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:45,901
You still can't step on the lines?
So you don't know where you're going?

35
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:51,103
- No, and I don't remember the way.
- That's a shame.

36
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,814
I remember the way.
Why don't we go together?

37
00:04:58,977 --> 00:05:01,027
I'll look up
while you look at the lines?

38
00:05:01,144 --> 00:05:05,695
I'd like that.
Is Fanny coming too?

39
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:09,603
- Yes, she's coming too.
- Good. She'll watch out for us.

40
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:18,359
- What's your favourite dish?
- Probably venison.

41
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:24,024
Mine's fish fingers.
Why do you work in our nursery?

42
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:30,402
Well, I was a teacher at your
brother's school, but then it closed.

43
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:37,443
My dad says you're sad because
you live alone in a big house.

44
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:39,611
Does he now?

45
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:44,362
Keep your head high
and your feet on the ground.

46
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,856
If you are still sulking,
you can get a kick up the arse.

47
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:55,698
- Did your dad teach you that?
- You can get a kick up the arse.

48
00:05:55,811 --> 00:06:01,821
- Can I come and walk Fanny?
- As often as you like.

49
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:04,982
Try calling her.

50
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:08,314
- Fanny!
- Louder.

51
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:12,359
Fanny! Come here!

52
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,562
- Klara, where have you been?
- At the supermarket.

53
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:23,031
Sweetie. Haven't I told you
not to run away from home?

54
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:27,193
- You want coffee?
- Fanny, come.

55
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:31,442
- Go to your room.
- Shit!

56
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:35,899
- Look what I found in the gutter.
- Hi, Lucas.

57
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,698
Hi, Fanny.
Who's a good girl?

58
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:45,103
Hi, babe. You didn't put that thing
away like you promised.

59
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:48,108
Do you also leave
your sporting gun lying about?

60
00:06:49,728 --> 00:06:54,279
I've told you, it's a rifle.
It's not a sport.

61
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:57,020
- Torsten!
- Torsten!

62
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,728
Young lady,
you have some thinking to do.

63
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:05,154
We're off to buy football boots.

64
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,897
Don't touch the pie! I mean it!

65
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,651
It better be in one piece.
Torsten, are you coming?

66
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:19,111
Drop in one of these days.
We'll make lasagne.

67
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:20,817
Lasagne...

68
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,112
She'll be furious.
Like that. I got it.

69
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:38,488
How are things
with Marcus and your ex?

70
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:40,405
Everything's fine.

71
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:49,737
I can tell when you're lying.
Your eye twitches.

72
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:53,646
- Really?
- Don't lie to me, Lucas.

73
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:59,110
She'll only let me see him
every other weekend.

74
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,156
Call Kirsten.

75
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,236
Forget the lawyers.
Quiet, Fanny!

76
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,858
Then don't mention Kirsten.
Stop it, Fanny!

77
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:18,106
- Do you miss Marcus?
- Of course I miss my boy.

78
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,484
- Pick up the phone and call Kirsten.
- Stop!

79
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:26,906
- Down, stupid dog!
- Stop it.

80
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,154
Shame on you!

81
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,073
He's unhappy that it's twelve days
at your place and two at mine.

82
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:39,482
<i>I think it works fine.</i>

83
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:42,822
Can I say something?
Thank you.

84
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:46,316
He wants to spend
more time here.

85
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:49,981
He said that
you were okay with it.

86
00:08:50,104 --> 00:08:52,439
Isn't that true?

87
00:08:52,563 --> 00:08:57,730
<i>Lucas, what else could he say?
He feels sorry for you.</i>

88
00:08:57,854 --> 00:09:02,820
- Come again? He feels sorry for me?
<i>- Of course!</i>

89
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:07,524
- Please behave like an adult.
<i>- You have to set yourself aside.</i>

90
00:09:07,646 --> 00:09:12,150
I do, damn it!
He was the one who asked.

91
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:17,237
<i>You can't even keep an agreement.
You're not supposed to call me.</i>

92
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:23,402
When are we supposed to talk,
if you don't call, and I can't call?

93
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,613
When can we talk then?

94
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:31,771
<i>- I'm hanging up.</i>
- No. When can we talk? Kirsten?

95
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,069
Old rod, big rod, crooked rod,
wrinkly rod...

96
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:04,483
- Rod, rod, rod!
- Hi, Klara.

97
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,699
Look, Klara.
A giant stiff rod.

98
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:13,158
- Let's go to my room.
- Massive hooker rod!

99
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,574
- Good morning, Klara.
- Good morning.

100
00:10:25,688 --> 00:10:32,574
<i>- Listen, you have to take her.
- You never keep an agreement!</i>

101
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:34,158
<i>We don't have an agreement!</i>

102
00:10:34,272 --> 00:10:38,490
Are they arguing? Are you sad?

103
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:42,362
No, he can have
a kick up the arse.

104
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,908
<i>If you have children,
you must take them to nursery!</i>

105
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:53,734
- Shall I take you to nursery?
- I'd like that.

106
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:56,949
I'll let your dad know.

107
00:10:57,064 --> 00:11:01,319
- Hi. You're making a racket.
<i>- We can't find Klara.</i>

108
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:06,155
- She's here. Why don't I take her?
<i>- Yes, of course. Bye.</i>

109
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:09,856
It's okay. Let's go.

110
00:11:12,814 --> 00:11:17,649
You can look where we're going,
then I'll look out for lines.

111
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,944
You're so weak!

112
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:11,408
Who wants to fly?

113
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,773
- Me too!
- Come here, then.

114
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,650
I need a break. I'm dying here.

115
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:26,530
- Me too!
- Me too!

116
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:30,654
- He's dying.
- Yeah!

117
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:36,780
- Wake up!
- Come on, wake up!

118
00:12:36,898 --> 00:12:40,358
Who's waking the dead?

119
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:43,491
Here's the hand of death.

120
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,488
Time for fruit.

121
00:12:52,023 --> 00:12:58,233
We'll be right there.
Clean up first. Klara...

122
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,487
I found a small present
in my coat pocket.

123
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:14,071
I think you should give it
to one of the boys.

124
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:22,617
- It's not from me.
- But it says "Klara".

125
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:27,947
Then someone must be teasing you.

126
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:35,072
Why don't you give it to your mum
or the person who made it?

127
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,780
And kissing on the lips
is only for Mum and Dad.

128
00:13:40,398 --> 00:13:43,823
It's not from me.
You're lying.

129
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:50,362
- It's not from me.
- Klara?

130
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:55,697
Boys. Tidy up.
And wash your hands.

131
00:13:55,815 --> 00:14:00,401
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

132
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:06,035
Hi, Pelle and Janus.

133
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:19,243
Hi, sweetie. Are you still here?
Your mum will be here in a minute.

134
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:23,817
Excited about Christmas?

135
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:30,608
Do you remember the carol?
Let's sing it.

136
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,985
I hate Lucas.

137
00:14:44,107 --> 00:14:47,781
- I thought you were friends.
- We're not.

138
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:50,493
Why not?

139
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:56,154
He's stupid, and he's ugly.

140
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:02,693
- And he has a willie.
- Most men do.

141
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,614
So does your dad and Torsten.

142
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:16,617
Yes, but his is pointing
straight out. Like a rod.

143
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:23,451
- Why do you say that?
- Because it does.

144
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:29,034
Did something happen, Klara?

145
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:35,821
He gave me this heart,
but I don't want it.

146
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,616
That's no good.
Then throw it away.

147
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:49,034
Is Santa coming this year?

148
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,368
Yeah... You never know.

149
00:15:53,483 --> 00:15:59,243
- I think he will.
- If you've been nice, he will.

150
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:05,485
Hi, Grethe. Hi, sweetheart.
Are you sitting in the dark?

151
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:11,990
I'm so sorry.
I came as fast as I could.

152
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:18,453
Did you have fun?
Something on your mind?

153
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:23,449
No, we've collected mushrooms
and turds in the woods today.

154
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,738
Sounds nice!
Come on. Let's go home.

155
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:32,243
- See you, Klara.
- Bye, Grethe.

156
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,866
Come, sweetie.

157
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:41,410
Let's hurry home and make dinner.

158
00:16:51,608 --> 00:16:57,984
Okay. Wow.
I'm thrilled to hear that.

159
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:03,240
- Did something happen?
- Bye-bye, see you!

160
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:09,119
- Did you talk about it?
<i>- Yes. He wants to live with you.</i>

161
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:13,737
<i>- He's very angry.</i>
- It'll be perfect.

162
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:17,283
I'll take him to yours
as often as he wants.

163
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:20,825
Are you okay?

164
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:25,901
<i>You'd better talk to him.
I'll go get him.</i>

165
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:30,532
Sorry. I'll just go through here.

166
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:36,363
<i>Dad? It's great. But I can't
change schools before Christmas.</i>

167
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:40,572
- We'll manage.
<i>- I'd better go and see to Mum.</i>

168
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:45,990
Okay. And Marcus,
be nice to her. It's not easy.

169
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:50,778
<i>- Of course. Bye.</i>
- I love you. See you soon.

170
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:59,578
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

171
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,237
That was my son.
He's going to live with me now.

172
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:14,869
Coffee...

173
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:19,242
Coffee now? Here?

174
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,829
Yes.

175
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,990
Let's have some coffee.
You want milk?

176
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,155
No. I want it black and strong.

177
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:47,990
<i>You're supposed to be gentle, right?
Do the dishes.</i>

178
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,368
Just like this?

179
00:19:14,193 --> 00:19:16,196
Thank you.

180
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:27,324
- Will you clean up the playground?
- Sure.

181
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,578
- See you tomorrow.
- Monday.

182
00:19:57,776 --> 00:20:01,534
- Tomorrow.
- No, on Monday. It's weekend.

183
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:09,237
I like it when we can see each other.

184
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:14,362
Me too.

185
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:19,570
Come here.

186
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:22,531
You're sweet.

187
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,870
You too.

188
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,277
Let's put it here.

189
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:55,282
You can't even hit the sack.

190
00:21:55,402 --> 00:21:59,823
It's the first time
I didn't shoot anything.

191
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,120
It really is.

192
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:08,948
Perhaps it's your eyes.
You might want to try these.

193
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:24,448
Listen. I'll call Ulla.

194
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,824
You bring roast pork.
Eel. Black pudding.

195
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:33,033
- Johan! Apple pork.
- Let's just say cheers.

196
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:36,033
You'll bring apple pork.

197
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,986
Hello. It's Lucas. Hello?

198
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:52,077
I can't hear a thing. One moment.
Hello, Lucas here.

199
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:29,951
It's me.

200
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:51,828
<i>Pussy! Pussy!</i>

201
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:03,330
I've been thinking about you a lot.

202
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,951
- Who did you call? A bird?
- Bent, stop it!

203
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,538
Hey, I'm quietly trying to tell you,

204
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:30,032
that he made a phone call
to a lady!

205
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:42,487
<i>Would Lucas, would Lucas,
would Lucas drink a beer?</i>

206
00:24:52,737 --> 00:24:56,080
<i>Oh surely, oh surely,
oh surely he would!</i>

207
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,786
<i>Oh surely, oh surely,
oh surely he would.</i>

208
00:25:03,154 --> 00:25:08,665
- I brought a present.
- And it's not even Christmas.

209
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,659
Come on. I'll help you.

210
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:16,330
- How much did he drink?
- I don't know. Lost count.

211
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:22,537
- Thank you so much.
- Lucas...

212
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:27,999
You're my best friend.

213
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:34,246
- See you. Have you got him?
- Kisses.

214
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:40,082
I'll call if I need you.
Goodbye.

215
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,450
Agnes...

216
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:52,202
I need to tell you something.
Do you know why you're so pretty?

217
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:57,204
- No.
- Because you don't know.

218
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:07,407
- Oh, honey.
- I love you.

219
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,498
I love you.

220
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:19,156
I love you. A lot.

221
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,452
Fanny. Fanny.

222
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,621
Fanny, where are you?

223
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:56,909
Come here. Come!
Thank you for the ball.

224
00:28:39,947 --> 00:28:42,662
I got you! First time ever!
Got you!

225
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,621
- Lucas. Lucas!
- Hi.

226
00:28:56,739 --> 00:29:00,496
- You can't escape me.
- Do you have a minute?

227
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,744
Yeah, just a second.
Boys, I can't catch you.

228
00:29:04,864 --> 00:29:08,822
After I drink some super juice,
I'll be back.

229
00:29:10,906 --> 00:29:15,789
- Hi, Grethe.
- Please take a seat.

230
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:21,334
- How's little Marcus?
- Good. He's not so little anymore.

231
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:26,245
He's planning to move in
with me before Christmas.

232
00:29:28,614 --> 00:29:33,615
I've been racking my brain,
but I can't get it out of my head.

233
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:42,376
A child has told me something,
I need to talk to you about it.

234
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:49,782
This child has a vivid imagination,
but I still wanted to mention it.

235
00:29:49,906 --> 00:29:52,407
Sure.
Who are we talking about?

236
00:29:54,656 --> 00:29:56,624
I can't tell you.

237
00:30:02,989 --> 00:30:08,536
The child says things have happened.
Things meant for adults only.

238
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:15,083
What things?
What has happened?

239
00:30:15,198 --> 00:30:20,033
The child says that
he or she doesn't like you.

240
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:27,824
And that he or she has seen
your private parts...

241
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:42,039
How the hell would that
even be possible?

242
00:30:42,156 --> 00:30:43,792
I don't know.

243
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:51,745
Shit...

244
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:59,164
It doesn't sound good,
but don't worry.

245
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:03,458
I'm not jumping to conclusions.
We'll work it out.

246
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:10,290
- What exactly has been said?
- I can't tell you.

247
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:16,952
And it's time for fruit
so we'd better move on.

248
00:31:20,698 --> 00:31:25,913
You should take a few days off.
Then we'll sort this out.

249
00:31:26,032 --> 00:31:29,955
Finish your shift today,
and then we'll think of something.

250
00:31:30,073 --> 00:31:32,077
I'll do that.

251
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:12,207
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No, it's fine.

252
00:32:12,324 --> 00:32:16,200
I'm not sure how this works.

253
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,419
Let's just get started.

254
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:25,163
Yes, Klara...

255
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:32,702
Can you try to tell me exactly
what you told Grethe?

256
00:32:48,241 --> 00:32:53,159
Please tell him
what you said about the heart.

257
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:03,243
I didn't say anything.

258
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:10,917
Is Grethe just making this up?

259
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,959
Or did you make it up?

260
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:16,745
No.

261
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:21,497
Alright...
Then try telling me.

262
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,168
It's okay to tell him.

263
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:40,536
Is it true that you said

264
00:33:40,699 --> 00:33:44,208
that you had seen Lucas' willie?

265
00:33:59,158 --> 00:34:02,417
Try to tell me what Lucas did.

266
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:05,953
Tell me about that, Klara.

267
00:34:08,408 --> 00:34:13,291
- I'd like to go out and play.
- You just have to answer.

268
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:17,710
Don't be afraid.
Ole won't hurt you.

269
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,539
He just wants to know
what's happened.

270
00:34:24,283 --> 00:34:27,910
Did he show you his willie
here in the nursery?

271
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,461
Did he, Klara?

272
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,955
Klara?

273
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,953
You are nodding.

274
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,457
So it was here in nursery?

275
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,087
Tell me what happened, then.

276
00:35:10,117 --> 00:35:13,744
Grethe said that
you said it was pointing.

277
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:18,413
Was his willie pointing?

278
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:23,827
I think so. I don't remember.

279
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,368
So he showed you his willie?

280
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,418
Is this uncomfortable to talk about?

281
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,622
Is that because you don't like
what he did?

282
00:35:55,659 --> 00:36:01,206
Klara, you're doing a great job
answering my questions.

283
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:04,999
We'll be done soon.

284
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:12,916
What did he do
after he showed you his willie?

285
00:36:13,034 --> 00:36:15,333
I don't really know.

286
00:36:17,201 --> 00:36:19,038
Did you touch it?

287
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:26,788
Do you remember?

288
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:29,878
Did...

289
00:36:31,576 --> 00:36:34,787
...something white
come out of it?

290
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,918
Perhaps this is too much at once.

291
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:49,625
You can go back out and play.

292
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:54,128
- Really?
- We just need to keep an eye on her.

293
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:06,582
You and I know each other,
which is fine,

294
00:37:06,701 --> 00:37:11,999
but this is actually a matter
for the police.

295
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:15,999
And we need the consent
of her parents.

296
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:20,041
I appreciate your help.
I'm not sure how to handle it.

297
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:25,041
Klara has a vivid imagination.

298
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,170
But it doesn't seem to be the case.

299
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:32,080
No, it doesn't appear that way.

300
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,086
No.

301
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:48,417
Ole says that we have to report it.

302
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:50,834
We have to notify the authorities.

303
00:37:55,785 --> 00:38:00,289
- The parents' meeting is off, then.
- I don't think so.

304
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,420
We're obliged to inform
the other parents.

305
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:10,122
- Where's Klara?
- She's outside playing.

306
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:14,085
Where's Lucas?

307
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:18,208
He's also outside playing.

308
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:21,835
- Shouldn't we send him home?
- Yes, we'd better.

309
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,418
Hi, Grethe. We were on our way
to football when you called.

310
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:03,495
- Please take a seat.
- I thought it was at 7:00 pm?

311
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:07,874
- Is everything okay?
- We need to talk about Klara.

312
00:39:07,994 --> 00:39:13,043
Perhaps Torsten should wait outside.

313
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:19,878
Wake up. Go and text or
play some games. I'll be right out.

314
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:27,327
What has she been up to,
that little rascal?

315
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:35,289
Something has occurred that shouldn't
occur between children and adults.

316
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,831
I haven't been able to prevent it.
I'm terribly sorry.

317
00:39:39,952 --> 00:39:43,911
Klara has recounted
sexual details about an adult.

318
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,713
I don't believe
a child would lie in that way.

319
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:57,702
It sounds very confusing.
What are you telling me?

320
00:39:57,827 --> 00:40:03,339
It seems that Klara has been
a victim of sexual abuse here.

321
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:06,498
Probably by someone close to you.

322
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:13,460
- Sexual abuse?
- The things she said...

323
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:18,787
She'll probably deny everything
because she's embarrassed.

324
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,332
But...

325
00:40:24,286 --> 00:40:26,538
How?

326
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:33,332
Let's see how bad it is.

327
00:40:37,744 --> 00:40:41,335
Hi. The cake is here.

328
00:40:41,453 --> 00:40:45,874
- Hi! Is it lactose free?
- Yes.

329
00:41:08,286 --> 00:41:13,964
May I have your attention?
We have a new item on the agenda.

330
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:24,121
We suspect indecent conduct
towards the children.

331
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:34,163
There are indications that an adult
has abused one of the children.

332
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:38,210
Theoretically there might be
more than one victim.

333
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:49,337
You should be on the lookout
for certain symptoms.

334
00:41:49,453 --> 00:41:55,166
Bedwetting, headaches and nightmares.
This evening we'll go into details.

335
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:59,079
I'll ask you to read this pamphlet.

336
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:03,541
This is a very serious accusation.

337
00:42:03,662 --> 00:42:06,672
Yes. But there's no need for panic.

338
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:11,706
We will of course follow
procedures to the letter.

339
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:28,704
Good morning, Marcus. Hello?

340
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:31,965
Hello?

341
00:42:33,204 --> 00:42:36,582
<i>- Dad...</i>
- Why are you whispering?

342
00:42:39,037 --> 00:42:41,503
<i>They won't let me call you.</i>

343
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,247
Who won't allow you?
Did something happen?

344
00:42:53,496 --> 00:42:55,748
Marcus, are you crying?

345
00:42:57,287 --> 00:43:00,582
<i>They're saying all these things
about you.</i>

346
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,038
<i>I'm not allowed to talk to you.</i>

347
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:06,166
<i>- Or allowed to move.</i>
- Who said that? Your mother?

348
00:43:07,704 --> 00:43:13,132
<i>They said that something disgusting
happened in the nursery.</i>

349
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:21,123
Don't listen to them. It's not true.

350
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:26,960
- Who called you?
<i>- Grethe from the nursery.</i>

351
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:37,043
Just go to school.
I'll talk to you tonight.

352
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:41,963
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Don't worry about it.

353
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:52,169
I should have told you... Sorry.
Yesterday...

354
00:43:53,704 --> 00:44:00,757
I was told that a kid had said
I had shown him my willie.

355
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,590
Or to her.

356
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:17,793
Yes.

357
00:44:20,746 --> 00:44:23,543
Now Marcus' mother
also knows about it.

358
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:40,581
- Hi.
- Hi.

359
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:44,670
Boys, not now.

360
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:50,715
- Is Grethe in?
- I thought you were on leave.

361
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,418
I just need to...

362
00:44:57,413 --> 00:45:00,673
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

363
00:45:02,288 --> 00:45:07,088
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm in the middle of something.

364
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:18,418
You'd better go home.
Leave Grethe alone.

365
00:45:18,538 --> 00:45:20,956
Grethe.

366
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,751
Grethe, come here.

367
00:45:27,997 --> 00:45:29,834
Stop it.

368
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:33,333
Why are you leaving?
This is absurd.

369
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:37,248
Don't come here
when I've asked you not to.

370
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:41,046
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- Stop right there!

371
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:45,549
- How could you do it? It's sick.
- What did I do?

372
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:52,330
- It's wrong to be here with you.
- Let me tell you what's wrong.

373
00:45:52,455 --> 00:45:58,381
You called Marcus' mother,
and now he's not allowed to come.

374
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:00,714
What do you suppose he's thinking?

375
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:04,915
I believe the children.
They don't lie.

376
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,462
You leave Marcus alone.
Do you understand?

377
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:16,878
You leave my children alone.
Klara is an innocent, little girl.

378
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:21,924
Is it Klara?
Grethe, is it Klara?

379
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:25,464
We'd better stop now. Let's go.

380
00:46:25,581 --> 00:46:28,875
What did she tell you?

381
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:32,920
It's my best friend's daughter.
You know that, don't you?

382
00:46:35,747 --> 00:46:39,421
Shit, it's Klara.
I have to talk to Theo.

383
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:47,384
What are you doing here?
Why is Ulla in the office, crying?

384
00:46:47,497 --> 00:46:51,800
- You'd better leave now, Lucas.
- What the hell?

385
00:46:51,914 --> 00:46:55,505
We have nothing to say
to each other. Go.

386
00:46:55,581 --> 00:46:58,876
- Have you gone mad?
- I might have. Off you go.

387
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:04,583
Go away, Lucas.

388
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:37,836
Hi, Theo.

389
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:41,001
I think we need to talk.

390
00:47:45,415 --> 00:47:46,836
Yes...

391
00:47:49,456 --> 00:47:52,881
Okay.
The others are asleep. Come on.

392
00:47:57,623 --> 00:48:00,420
Let me get a drink.

393
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:23,424
I've made lemonade.

394
00:48:24,748 --> 00:48:27,711
If you're thirsty...

395
00:48:29,957 --> 00:48:31,343
Thanks.

396
00:48:31,457 --> 00:48:35,510
Now, listen...
We have to talk about this.

397
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:41,426
Yes.

398
00:48:44,248 --> 00:48:46,251
What are they saying?

399
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,504
You have to ask your daughter.
They don't tell me anything.

400
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:57,800
It's blown out of all proportion.

401
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:04,040
You and I have to sit down
and figure out what's happened,

402
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:09,333
and then go to Grethe
before all hell breaks loose.

403
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:23,259
You want me to ask Klara?
Is that what you want?

404
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:26,758
Of course.
What do you mean?

405
00:49:27,957 --> 00:49:33,385
Lucas... I know my little girl.
She doesn't lie. She never did.

406
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:40,217
Why would she be lying now?

407
00:49:44,374 --> 00:49:49,209
I don't know why, but she is.

408
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:04,301
- Lucas, for fuck's sake.
- I didn't touch your daughter.

409
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:15,840
You know that I didn't.

410
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:21,835
Do you believe me or not?

411
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,086
I don't know.

412
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:36,964
- Theo, I didn't touch your daughter.
- I don't know, Lucas.

413
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:54,676
- He's not supposed to be here.
- Probably not.

414
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,086
- You must go now.
- What did I do?

415
00:50:59,249 --> 00:51:01,928
What is it you think I did?

416
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:07,386
Shut up! Get out!
I don't want to talk to you!

417
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,963
Bastard. Don't sit in our sofa.
I never want to see you again.

418
00:51:13,083 --> 00:51:16,045
I'll cut your dick off. Get out!

419
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,044
Hey, Lucas...

420
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,300
Are you insane?

421
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:27,880
If you touched my daughter,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

422
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,797
And I think you did,
because she says so.

423
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:35,754
Do you want to ruin my life?
Do you?

424
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:39,300
- Look at me!
- What are you doing?

425
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:44,135
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi, Lucas.

426
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,505
Klara, go to your room.
Agnes!

427
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,752
Come, let's go to the living room.

428
00:51:57,042 --> 00:52:00,135
Is Dad sad?

429
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,841
He'll cool down. You know that.

430
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:09,925
- Let's sit here and wake up.
- Are you mad at Lucas?

431
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:18,922
- Let's just sit here.
- He didn't do anything.

432
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:25,715
I just said something foolish.
Now all the kids are talking.

433
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:40,626
Honey...
It's difficult to understand.

434
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:44,590
But perhaps it's like this.

435
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,719
Your mind prefers not
to remember what happened.

436
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:55,048
It's unpleasant to think about,
but, Klara, it did happen.

437
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:00,384
And we're so happy
that you've told us.

438
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,130
Right, honey?

439
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:13,043
Come. Let's have some cookies.

440
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:25,965
Hi, Nadja.
Please come in and sit down.

441
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:41,378
You've probably heard about it.
We've reported the incident.

442
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:51,010
We have informed the parents
about the symptoms of abuse,

443
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:56,340
and they've asked their children
if they've had any nightmares...

444
00:53:59,168 --> 00:54:04,880
A number of parents
reported symptoms of abuse.

445
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:07,086
So we had to act.

446
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,922
Are you seeing Lucas?

447
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:53,388
Lucas has walked Klara here.
They've been seen together.

448
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:59,338
He's been alone with the children.
In the toilets and the soft play room.

449
00:55:00,626 --> 00:55:03,589
Kirsten, it's me again.
Please call me.

450
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:15,637
She doesn't answer.

451
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,589
Perhaps,
but I need to talk to Marcus.

452
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:31,211
What did they say in nursery?

453
00:55:44,543 --> 00:55:47,637
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

454
00:55:53,043 --> 00:55:58,211
- What are you doing here?
- Can I walk Fanny?

455
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:02,295
Okay. Of course.

456
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:07,716
Does your mum know you're here?

457
00:56:12,919 --> 00:56:16,012
You need to talk to your mum
before you come over.

458
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:26,336
They say that
you did bad things to me.

459
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:41,176
Do you believe that too?

460
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:46,428
I don't know.
I don't really remember.

461
00:56:54,836 --> 00:57:00,963
- What did I do, sweetie?
- I don't remember anymore.

462
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:03,468
It's also the others.

463
00:57:08,294 --> 00:57:11,139
Who are the others?

464
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:16,548
Klara, who are they?

465
00:57:16,669 --> 00:57:18,470
I'm scared.

466
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:29,260
Do you want to go home?

467
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:37,259
- What about Fanny?
- You can walk her another day.

468
00:57:39,169 --> 00:57:41,089
You'd better go home now.

469
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:07,382
What?

470
00:58:16,461 --> 00:58:18,346
What do you think?

471
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:33,254
What do you mean?

472
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,755
Do you think I'm insane?

473
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:49,721
Do you think I'm insane?

474
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:02,838
You'd better go. Get your things.

475
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,381
Come... I want you to leave.

476
00:59:16,462 --> 00:59:22,174
I've harmed a child. Is that
what you're saying, you idiot?

477
00:59:22,295 --> 00:59:24,878
Get out. Out!

478
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:39,838
- Look, it's snowing.
- Right on the elf.

479
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:41,171
Yes.

480
00:59:47,504 --> 00:59:52,138
Let's put this one on the lake.

481
00:59:52,254 --> 00:59:55,513
Yes. They're skating.

482
00:59:57,795 --> 01:00:01,635
- Where's he going?
- You decide.

483
01:00:02,587 --> 01:00:04,057
Here.

484
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:09,134
Yes.

485
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:14,807
And this one up there...

486
01:00:16,921 --> 01:00:19,422
Then he can see everything.

487
01:00:26,962 --> 01:00:29,843
Shouldn't he join the others?

488
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,597
It's snowing!
Don't you want to see it?

489
01:00:36,712 --> 01:00:40,671
- I'm coming.
- It's so pretty!

490
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:46,431
Don't get cold.

491
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:20,516
What the hell?

492
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:21,922
Marcus?

493
01:02:24,505 --> 01:02:27,088
Is it you?

494
01:02:27,213 --> 01:02:30,923
- Sorry. Come here.
- You scared me.

495
01:02:31,005 --> 01:02:34,845
- I didn't mean to. Are you okay?
- Yes.

496
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:39,386
Hi, Fanny, old girl.

497
01:02:43,297 --> 01:02:47,599
- Does Mum know you're here?
- Yes.

498
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:53,842
- Where the hell is the key?
- I gave it to someone.

499
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:58,599
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

500
01:02:59,797 --> 01:03:04,265
- What a mess. It looks like shit.
- Come here...

501
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,969
Stop it already.

502
01:03:09,047 --> 01:03:13,183
Mum suggested that
I drop by to say hello.

503
01:03:13,297 --> 01:03:16,259
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- Well...

504
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:20,803
I took a couple of days off.

505
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:25,592
You know that things
aren't normal around here.

506
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:28,475
I've been fired.

507
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:33,803
The police are involved,
but they tell me bugger all.

508
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:38,090
I'm going crazy.

509
01:03:40,547 --> 01:03:43,095
Mum doesn't know you're here,
does she?

510
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:52,017
- Does she?
- Fuck, man.

511
01:03:53,214 --> 01:03:55,182
I'm crying again...

512
01:04:05,422 --> 01:04:09,132
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

513
01:04:12,881 --> 01:04:18,309
- It's okay.
- I'll pull myself together.

514
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,675
It's ridiculous, man.

515
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:35,841
- Hi.
- Hi.

516
01:04:35,964 --> 01:04:40,101
Well, if it isn't my godson.
Hi, Marcus.

517
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:43,841
- Hi.
- Do you have time to be here?

518
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:48,508
- The air is a little dry in here.
- Coffee?

519
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:50,053
Yeah.

520
01:04:54,673 --> 01:04:59,473
Did you talk to the police?
What did they say?

521
01:05:02,423 --> 01:05:05,268
They asked a bunch of questions.

522
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:09,257
Evidently,
I've touched other kids as well.

523
01:05:09,756 --> 01:05:12,304
- It's insane.
- Completely.

524
01:05:13,548 --> 01:05:17,008
What? Bloody hell,
you didn't do anything!

525
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:23,262
It's all of them now.
It's Johan, it's Bent...

526
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:27,091
They've gone raving mad.

527
01:05:30,423 --> 01:05:34,844
You've always put up with too much.
I've told you before.

528
01:05:37,881 --> 01:05:42,053
Alright, Fanny. Kirsten!

529
01:05:42,173 --> 01:05:44,223
Yes. Still got it!

530
01:05:48,965 --> 01:05:51,217
I don't know...

531
01:05:55,632 --> 01:06:00,716
Thanks. It'll be alright.
Marcus is here now...

532
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,467
Neglecting to pour
his godfather a cup of coffee.

533
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,181
- What about your hunting license?
- October 16th.

534
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:12,600
The day when men become mice,
and mice become men.

535
01:06:19,382 --> 01:06:22,476
Call Mum and say you're here.

536
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:26,727
And Marcus? If she flares up,
I'll put her in her place.

537
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:53,851
- That'll be 269.50.
- Here you go.

538
01:06:57,507 --> 01:07:00,850
- Thank you. Here's 30.50.
- Thanks.

539
01:07:03,424 --> 01:07:09,599
- Hi, Marcus. Is your dad with you?
- No.

540
01:07:09,716 --> 01:07:14,302
Tell him that neither of you
are welcome here anymore.

541
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:20,799
- Why?
- We have other customers.

542
01:07:22,132 --> 01:07:23,970
You're not welcome.

543
01:07:45,966 --> 01:07:49,474
- What's going on?
- Is that your son?

544
01:07:55,008 --> 01:07:59,594
Can I...? Call Mum and tell her
to pick you up.

545
01:07:59,716 --> 01:08:03,425
I've been arrested. I need to go.
Are you okay?

546
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:08,930
Jump in. The opposite seat.

547
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,387
Fuck, man!

548
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,639
- Hi, Marcus.
- Do you have a key to our house?

549
01:08:55,591 --> 01:08:59,467
A key? I don't think so.

550
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:02,845
- I'm off, then.
- Marcus, are you okay?

551
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:08,220
- Yes.
- Listen...

552
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:13,720
We know they picked up your dad.

553
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:23,103
Can I have a word with you?
Can I have a word?

554
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,721
Yes, but we...

555
01:09:28,425 --> 01:09:31,636
Come on in. Are you hungry?

556
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:37,932
Go and say hello to Marcus.
Klara, can you find the mugs?

557
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:41,724
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hi.

558
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:48,886
Well... See you.

559
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:54,723
Hi! He's sat in there...

560
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:11,852
We can give you a lift.

561
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:15,092
Or call your mum.

562
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:27,431
Marcus, are you okay?
Are you okay?

563
01:10:31,175 --> 01:10:34,849
I just wanted to ask
if you'd help my dad?

564
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:39,305
Help your dad? How?

565
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:42,347
Could you think it
all through again?

566
01:10:43,884 --> 01:10:49,134
You're such a good boy,
and I understand your feelings.

567
01:10:49,259 --> 01:10:52,305
You shouldn't pay
for his mistakes.

568
01:10:52,426 --> 01:10:54,808
But he hasn't done
what you say.

569
01:10:56,926 --> 01:11:01,761
- Honey, go to your room.
- I want to tell her something.

570
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,555
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

571
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:07,977
Are you doing all right?

572
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:14,560
- Why are you lying about my dad?
- I'm not.

573
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:20,104
- Let's go, Klara.
- I just want to talk...

574
01:11:20,218 --> 01:11:22,932
- Let go!
- Stop it!

575
01:11:23,051 --> 01:11:28,135
- Don't touch her.
- You're out of here.

576
01:11:28,259 --> 01:11:31,471
- I've had it with you.
- I just want to talk to her.

577
01:11:31,593 --> 01:11:36,262
- Why do you lie about my dad, bitch?
- Oh no, you didn't!

578
01:11:36,384 --> 01:11:41,184
- Get him out of here.
- I want to talk to her!

579
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:42,771
Enough already.

580
01:11:44,093 --> 01:11:46,261
What the hell?

581
01:11:47,176 --> 01:11:51,597
Johan, for fuck's sake! Stop it!

582
01:11:51,718 --> 01:11:56,470
Stop it. Get away from him!

583
01:11:58,885 --> 01:12:01,386
Get up and go home.

584
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:05,386
- Go home.
- Fucking assholes!

585
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,513
Come on.

586
01:12:10,843 --> 01:12:12,348
Fucking assholes!

587
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:31,561
Hi, Marcus. Good to see you.
Come on.

588
01:12:31,676 --> 01:12:34,521
You're exhausted.

589
01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:44,636
- Did someone hit you?
- No.

590
01:12:50,343 --> 01:12:53,389
Young ladies, keep it down.

591
01:12:54,635 --> 01:12:57,266
Some relatives are staying over.

592
01:12:59,468 --> 01:13:01,720
Come on, Marcus.

593
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:05,766
My two sisters.
You met them when you were a child.

594
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:11,598
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
- We call them Chip and Dale.

595
01:13:11,718 --> 01:13:16,933
They're cracking nuts.
My old man is helping your dad.

596
01:13:21,052 --> 01:13:26,184
This is Lucas' boy, Marcus.
Elias and Erik. My brothers in law.

597
01:13:28,677 --> 01:13:31,557
I'm Erik. This bastard is Elias.

598
01:13:31,677 --> 01:13:37,271
- Sit down. Get him some water.
- Are you thirsty?

599
01:13:40,427 --> 01:13:43,887
- Is tap water okay?
- Thanks.

600
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,973
I've spoken to your mum.

601
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:50,104
Remember to phone home.
Agreed?

602
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:56,685
Do you know
what's happening to Dad?

603
01:14:02,385 --> 01:14:05,147
What did dad say?

604
01:14:05,261 --> 01:14:11,554
He said that Lucas has
a preliminary hearing tomorrow.

605
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:15,268
At 8:30 am.
There are two possible outcomes.

606
01:14:15,386 --> 01:14:20,055
Either the judge
confirms the remand.

607
01:14:20,177 --> 01:14:25,522
Or he finds no basis
for keeping him.

608
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:32,559
What do you think will happen?

609
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:37,182
I don't know.

610
01:14:38,177 --> 01:14:43,262
Apparently, all the children
are telling the same story.

611
01:14:44,136 --> 01:14:51,188
They describe your basement,
the wallpaper, the colour of the sofa.

612
01:14:52,678 --> 01:14:56,020
But when the police searched
your house this morning,

613
01:14:57,428 --> 01:14:59,478
they discovered what, Marcus?

614
01:15:04,678 --> 01:15:07,889
- That we don't have a basement.
- Exactly.

615
01:15:09,136 --> 01:15:13,012
- What does that mean?
- That they don't have a basement!

616
01:15:13,136 --> 01:15:18,648
- What does it mean for Lucas?
- It means there's still hope.

617
01:15:18,761 --> 01:15:25,137
It's common for children
to describe non-existing details.

618
01:15:25,261 --> 01:15:29,314
I don't know
if it's their imagination,

619
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:33,481
or they pick it up from each other
or from their parents.

620
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:36,688
It's always assumed
that children tell the truth.

621
01:15:38,345 --> 01:15:41,023
And unfortunately,
very often they do.

622
01:15:44,095 --> 01:15:49,013
- Now what?
- We'll have to wait and see.

623
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,765
They'll call us tomorrow.

624
01:17:05,304 --> 01:17:07,686
Good morning, lad.

625
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,521
Sleep well?

626
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:16,774
I've brought you bread,
cheese and coffee.

627
01:17:16,887 --> 01:17:18,179
Thanks.

628
01:17:19,554 --> 01:17:22,434
I need to talk to you.

629
01:17:24,137 --> 01:17:29,684
I'm your godfather,
and you can count on me.

630
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:34,518
No matter what happens. Okay?

631
01:17:38,637 --> 01:17:43,307
I've just spoken to your dad.
It looks good.

632
01:17:43,429 --> 01:17:46,688
- He's on his way in a taxi.
- What?

633
01:17:46,804 --> 01:17:48,772
They let him go.

634
01:17:48,887 --> 01:17:51,898
Eat your bread
and drink your coffee.

635
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:56,978
Then we'll go downstairs
and welcome your dad.

636
01:18:22,263 --> 01:18:27,098
Hey! If you fondle your kid,
you'll go back to jail.

637
01:18:27,221 --> 01:18:29,936
We've got bacon and eggs.
It won't eat itself.

638
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:33,230
- Come on.
- It's good to see you.

639
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,977
Fanny! Hi, Fanny-girl.

640
01:18:38,096 --> 01:18:44,390
It's not too messy. You two,
grab a shovel and dig a basement.

641
01:18:44,513 --> 01:18:49,147
- Fanny has peed on the floor.
- No. It's probably the police.

642
01:19:19,513 --> 01:19:22,973
- Fanny!
- She'll be here in a minute.

643
01:19:31,055 --> 01:19:34,729
Do you want me to wash
the knickers I found?

644
01:19:38,263 --> 01:19:42,767
- Do you?
- What's your point?

645
01:19:42,888 --> 01:19:47,107
Nothing. I just asked
if you want them washed.

646
01:19:47,222 --> 01:19:50,896
- Yes, if you can find them.
- I will, in a minute.

647
01:19:52,222 --> 01:19:56,477
If you put them in the wash.
Are you seeing each other?

648
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:59,180
I thought so.
Then all this happened.

649
01:20:02,305 --> 01:20:05,185
I wanted you to meet her,
but we'll see.

650
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:13,473
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, it's not my thing.

651
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:18,849
- Having a girlfriend?
- No.

652
01:20:22,597 --> 01:20:26,603
- I remember Jasmin.
- That's more than a year ago.

653
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:39,024
Stay down. Don't move.

654
01:20:50,097 --> 01:20:52,314
Hello!

655
01:21:00,097 --> 01:21:01,519
Hello!

656
01:21:41,348 --> 01:21:43,267
What's that?

657
01:21:45,389 --> 01:21:47,890
- Dad, what is it?
- Go back in, Marcus.

658
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:53,191
Let's go back in.

659
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:58,978
- Come on in.
- Forget it, man.

660
01:22:23,765 --> 01:22:27,853
- You're dead!
- Stop it.

661
01:22:27,973 --> 01:22:31,351
- Relax...
- Fucking dead! Let go of me!

662
01:22:31,473 --> 01:22:34,400
- Stop it!
- I'll kill you!

663
01:22:37,848 --> 01:22:42,020
I'll kill you!
Bring her in. She's cold.

664
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,151
Lucas?

665
01:23:08,598 --> 01:23:11,443
I'd like to be alone.

666
01:23:11,557 --> 01:23:13,642
Where's Marcus?

667
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:19,483
- You sent him back to his mum?
- Yes.

668
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:28,812
- Please leave, Bruun.
- Come on in.

669
01:23:28,932 --> 01:23:31,563
Go home, when I tell you to!

670
01:23:33,598 --> 01:23:35,353
Just go.

671
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:20,809
- Here you go. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Per.

672
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,108
- I'd like two chops.
- We don't have chops.

673
01:24:30,891 --> 01:24:34,683
- Sorry, I mean those pork chops.
- You can't buy anything here.

674
01:24:43,474 --> 01:24:46,568
- I have a right to shop here.
- I want you to leave.

675
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:52,228
- You need to leave. Scram.
- I want two chops.

676
01:25:06,016 --> 01:25:10,022
Off you go.
Don't come here.

677
01:25:15,391 --> 01:25:21,400
- You're not welcome.
- You can't hit a person like that.

678
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:24,610
You have to leave now.

679
01:25:26,058 --> 01:25:29,068
- Is it normal to hit someone like that?
- Get out.

680
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:31,642
I can walk!

681
01:25:37,808 --> 01:25:42,145
- I need my stuff.
- Get out! Now!

682
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:51,810
- Get him out.
- Not a moment too soon.

683
01:25:51,975 --> 01:25:55,234
Get out!

684
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,111
Thank you for coming.

685
01:26:00,808 --> 01:26:04,186
Get lost.

686
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:07,437
Bugger off.
Don't come here ever again.

687
01:26:08,475 --> 01:26:10,229
Stay away.

688
01:27:01,808 --> 01:27:06,893
Didn't I tell you to get lost?
I won't tell you again.

689
01:27:08,683 --> 01:27:11,149
I just want to say something.

690
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:19,318
- Fuck! Shit, that hurts.
- What the hell?

691
01:27:20,392 --> 01:27:24,813
- Can I have my things, please?
- Just give him his groceries.

692
01:27:30,017 --> 01:27:32,778
Fucking hell.

693
01:27:36,225 --> 01:27:38,560
That's 45.50.

694
01:27:49,017 --> 01:27:51,779
Good God, it's Lucas.

695
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:54,352
Look at him. He's a mess.

696
01:27:59,934 --> 01:28:04,935
- I'll go and speak to him.
- Let's stay here until he's gone.

697
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:13,317
Where's Fanny?

698
01:28:17,684 --> 01:28:19,604
I don't know.

699
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:23,147
Shit...

700
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:58,356
CHRISTMAS EVE

701
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:02,769
I'd like to go in.

702
01:31:43,686 --> 01:31:48,486
A warm welcome to you all.
And merry Christmas.

703
01:31:48,602 --> 01:31:52,940
This is our Christmas service.

704
01:31:53,061 --> 01:31:56,486
As always,
we'll open with a prayer.

705
01:32:03,269 --> 01:32:07,488
I have come into this your house
to hear what you say to me,

706
01:32:07,603 --> 01:32:11,028
God the Father, you, Lord Jesus,

707
01:32:11,144 --> 01:32:15,944
good Holy Spirit,
in life and death my comforter.

708
01:32:16,769 --> 01:32:22,151
Open my heart by your Holy Spirit,
for the sake of Jesus Christ.

709
01:32:22,269 --> 01:32:27,437
So that I may learn to repent my sins
and to believe in Jesus,

710
01:32:27,561 --> 01:32:32,029
and every day
to grow in holy life and living.

711
01:32:32,144 --> 01:32:37,193
Hear me and grant this, Oh God,
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

712
01:32:43,436 --> 01:32:48,485
Christmas Eve is about Baby Jesus.

713
01:32:48,645 --> 01:32:51,690
The son of God is born.

714
01:32:51,811 --> 01:32:55,948
- What's wrong?
- I can tell by looking at him.

715
01:32:57,478 --> 01:32:59,315
Tell what?

716
01:33:00,936 --> 01:33:06,364
We should think about it
during the Lord's Prayer.

717
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:13,944
Father, you say. And then it happens.
You have become a child of God.

718
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:21,480
It is starting now.
Christmas time is a time for children.

719
01:33:22,603 --> 01:33:26,905
This year we want to emphasize
the gospel for Christmas Day.

720
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:31,985
We've invited the nursery choir
who have been practising,

721
01:33:32,103 --> 01:33:37,732
so we may enjoy the hymn
"A Child is Born in Bethlehem".

722
01:33:44,937 --> 01:33:47,899
Come on, stand over here.

723
01:33:55,145 --> 01:33:57,776
Klara, you stand here.

724
01:34:00,103 --> 01:34:02,023
Take a step forward.

725
01:35:19,937 --> 01:35:24,074
What are you saying?

726
01:35:24,187 --> 01:35:28,738
- Have you got something to say to me?
- Stop it, Lucas.

727
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:32,647
- You want to tell me something?
- Relax, Lucas!

728
01:35:32,771 --> 01:35:36,859
The whole town is listening.
Tell me!

729
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:42,608
- You psycho!
- What do you want to say?

730
01:35:47,021 --> 01:35:52,070
- Stop it, you fucking psychopath!
- I want a word with Theo.

731
01:35:52,188 --> 01:35:57,438
Look into my eyes.
Look me in the eyes.

732
01:35:59,146 --> 01:36:03,697
What do you see?
Do you see anything?

733
01:36:05,021 --> 01:36:08,979
Nothing. There's nothing.

734
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:12,032
There's nothing.

735
01:36:13,729 --> 01:36:15,863
You leave me alone now.

736
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:22,029
Leave me alone now, Theo.
Then I'll go. Thank you.

737
01:36:48,438 --> 01:36:53,783
- You're the lucky one.
- You've had enough presents.

738
01:36:55,021 --> 01:36:58,281
It's exactly what you wished for.

739
01:37:01,147 --> 01:37:03,446
I've got her.

740
01:37:35,938 --> 01:37:37,740
Fanny...

741
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,155
Lucas... Hi, Lucas.

742
01:38:06,605 --> 01:38:09,781
It was not supposed to happen.

743
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,568
Klara, honey...

744
01:38:28,397 --> 01:38:30,780
It's not Lucas. It's just Dad.

745
01:38:39,231 --> 01:38:41,862
- Dad, are you crying?
- No.

746
01:38:43,606 --> 01:38:49,069
The world is full of evil.

747
01:38:50,147 --> 01:38:54,568
But if we hold on to each other,
it goes away.

748
01:38:55,897 --> 01:38:58,742
Are you really sad?

749
01:39:03,314 --> 01:39:05,115
No.

750
01:39:06,314 --> 01:39:08,898
You know,

751
01:39:09,023 --> 01:39:14,700
that Lucas is my very best friend.

752
01:39:14,814 --> 01:39:20,242
We rode our mopeds...

753
01:39:20,356 --> 01:39:23,450
We stole apples and all that.
I've told you before.

754
01:39:25,356 --> 01:39:28,236
I just said something foolish.

755
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:33,406
He didn't do anything.

756
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:44,943
- No.
- No.

757
01:39:48,356 --> 01:39:50,739
Go to sleep.

758
01:40:08,231 --> 01:40:11,775
- What are you doing?
- Just go join the others.

759
01:40:14,565 --> 01:40:16,568
Who's that for?

760
01:40:17,731 --> 01:40:21,489
Give me ten minutes,
and I'll be back.

761
01:40:22,940 --> 01:40:27,112
Theo.
You're not going to his place.

762
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:33,815
Agnes, step aside.

763
01:40:58,648 --> 01:41:03,318
- Hey. Lucas...
- What are you doing here?

764
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:05,159
It's just me.

765
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:14,483
What the hell are you doing here?

766
01:41:22,274 --> 01:41:25,367
I brought you some food,
in case...

767
01:41:30,565 --> 01:41:32,651
Are you hungry?

768
01:41:39,524 --> 01:41:42,735
Go ahead and eat, if you want.

769
01:42:47,608 --> 01:42:52,443
It's very nice.
You can just go home, if you like.

770
01:42:59,649 --> 01:43:01,155
No...

771
01:43:02,733 --> 01:43:06,360
Actually,
I'd like to stay for a while.

772
01:43:06,483 --> 01:43:08,284
If it's okay.

773
01:44:07,942 --> 01:44:12,409
ONE YEAR LATER

774
01:44:35,733 --> 01:44:37,819
- Ready?
- Yes.

775
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,238
- Hi, Johan.
- Hello.

776
01:44:50,275 --> 01:44:52,610
Hi, Dan. So we're back.

777
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:55,321
Lucas!

778
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,863
- Good to see you.
- You too.

779
01:45:05,484 --> 01:45:11,445
Quiet! Shut up.
We're gathered here for a reason.

780
01:45:12,234 --> 01:45:16,192
This is the day
when boys become men,

781
01:45:16,317 --> 01:45:18,403
and men become boys.

782
01:45:18,526 --> 01:45:23,278
Marcus, old boy.
You have your hunting license.

783
01:45:23,401 --> 01:45:27,323
And it's your turn
tomorrow at the crack of dawn.

784
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:31,363
You're becoming an adult.

785
01:45:31,484 --> 01:45:34,695
You're about to conquer the forest.

786
01:45:34,817 --> 01:45:36,737
Come here, my boy.

787
01:45:46,484 --> 01:45:49,909
It's a great pleasure
to see you here.

788
01:45:51,442 --> 01:45:53,944
This is for you.

789
01:46:08,776 --> 01:46:11,786
I wish you were my boy,

790
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:15,954
and that this was
a present from me.

791
01:46:16,026 --> 01:46:22,367
But it's not from me.
It's from your father.

792
01:46:22,484 --> 01:46:25,863
It's been in your family
for generations,

793
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:29,363
and now... it's yours.

794
01:46:30,568 --> 01:46:32,203
Take care of it.

795
01:46:32,318 --> 01:46:37,319
Your grandfather missed
many deer

796
01:46:37,443 --> 01:46:39,742
in order to feed your family.

797
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:43,492
Don't forget that.
Congratulations!

798
01:46:44,776 --> 01:46:49,031
<i>We hope that he will drink with us,
and drink with us, and drink with us!</i>

799
01:46:49,151 --> 01:46:53,204
<i>We hope that he will drink with us,
that he will drink with us!</i>

800
01:46:53,318 --> 01:46:58,367
<i>That he will drink with us!</i>

801
01:46:58,485 --> 01:46:59,907
Cheers and congratulations!

802
01:47:00,026 --> 01:47:02,492
Lunch is served!

803
01:47:07,485 --> 01:47:11,075
- Do you have any more?
- We'll bring it in.

804
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:35,445
That's tricky. Look at all
those lines you can't step on.

805
01:47:35,568 --> 01:47:38,330
Yes, I was just
thinking the same.

806
01:47:41,068 --> 01:47:43,451
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

807
01:47:45,068 --> 01:47:46,906
Are you okay?

808
01:47:59,318 --> 01:48:04,948
- How do we get around those lines?
- I don't know. There are so many.

809
01:48:05,069 --> 01:48:06,704
Yes.

810
01:48:15,194 --> 01:48:16,403
Come.

811
01:48:22,819 --> 01:48:24,241
Careful now.

812
01:48:25,569 --> 01:48:29,622
Very long steps...

813
01:48:30,527 --> 01:48:34,403
We made it.
I think your dad is in there.

814
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:39,448
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

815
01:48:56,569 --> 01:49:01,321
- You're scaring the deer.
- What am I doing?

816
01:49:03,736 --> 01:49:07,114
- Did I ruin everything?
- No, it'll be back.

817
01:49:07,819 --> 01:49:13,496
Marcus. Go wait by your deer stand.
You'll wait a while but they'll come.

818
01:49:15,486 --> 01:49:17,406
Are you ready?

818
01:49:18,305 --> 01:50:18,799
