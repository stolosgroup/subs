00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,596
Lobbying is about foresight.

3
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,075
About anticipating
your opponent's moves

4
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,190
and devising countermeasures.

5
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,636
The winner plots one step
ahead of the opposition,

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,879
and plays her trump card

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,436
just after they play theirs.

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,136
You better
not be saying that

9
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,309
when you're in there.

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,871
It's about making sure
you surprise them,

11
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,430
and they don't surprise you.

12
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,874
I'm gonna ask you again.

13
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,296
Miss Sloane, could you please

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,719
describe the nature
of your work?

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,096
On the advice of counsel,

16
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,896
I respectfully decline
to answer your question,

17
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,751
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,160
to the United States
Constitution.

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,588
Those words,

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,576
when you're not taking the
oath or confirming details,

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,680
those words, in that order,
are all you're gonna say.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,995
"On average, would you say
you bribed public officials

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
"more or less
than once a month?"

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,718
Upon the advice of counsel...
Can I deviate slightly?

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
"On the advice of counsel"?
On the advice

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,816
- "of my attorney"?
- You do not...

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,910
Okay, okay, I understand
that last one's

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,194
too adventurous for you.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
This would be
a whole lot easier

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,639
if I could just shout "Fifth."

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,349
They want you behind bars.

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,675
You make one statement,

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,313
you correct one
nefarious allegation,

34
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,879
that's it.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,240
You waive your right
to the Fifth

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,920
and you're compelled
to answer everything.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,376
They're taking you
to the woodshed

38
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,600
in front of
the national press.

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,838
They're gonna rile you so bad

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,116
they'd make Gandhi wanna
cut their tongues out.

41
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,656
" Did you arrange for
benefits such as travel,

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,749
"luxury accommodations,

43
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,176

"luxury accommodations,

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Daniel. When I take the stand,

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,153
you'll see nothing
but a granite wall.

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,389
Good.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,674
Miss Sloane!

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,910
Nothing to say, guys,
thank you.

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,758
Miss Sloane, Miss Sloane!

54
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,193
This is tight.

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
You'd think they would choose
a more appropriate venue.

56
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,916
Well, turns out the Nationals
had a home game.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,955
Good morning.

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,235
I am Senator Ronald Sperling,

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,635
Chair of this Hearing.
Miss Sloane...

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,633
Please raise your right hand.

61
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,476
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,176
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

63
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,475
under pains and penalties
of perjury?

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,118
- I do.
- Please, sit.

65
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,990
Will the witness please
state her full name

66
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,308
for the record?

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,799
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.

68
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,029
Louder, please.

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,677
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.

70
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,496
And could
the witness please confirm

71
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,954
that these details
are accurate...

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,474
Uh...

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,348
Date of birth, July 26, 1976,
address...

74
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,069
Suite 504, Watergate South,

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,390
700 New Hampshire Avenue
North West, Washington D.C.?

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,075
Correct.

77
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,069
You were employed by Cole,
Kravitz and Waterman LLP

78
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,629
for a 10-year period
between 2006 and 2016,

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,776
before moving on earlier...

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Eleven year period.

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,435
Excuse me?

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,512
There are 11 years
between 2006 and 2016.

83
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
What was the nature
of your work

84
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,990
with Cole, Kravitz
and Waterman LLP?

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,675
Upon the advice of counsel,

86
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,830
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,360
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,072
to the United States
Constitution.

89
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,558
Did you,
October 12th of last year,

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,631
accept as a client
the government

91
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,950
of the Asian Republic
of Indonesia,

92
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,758
for the purpose of
campaigning against

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,229
the levy of additional
Federal duties

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,596
on the importation of palm oil
into the United States?

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,748
Upon the advice of counsel,

96
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,235
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

97
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,231
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,516
to the United States
Constitution.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,877
Today is a landmark day,
you know why?

100
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,029
Because I'm free.

101
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,348
Name one thing
you can do today

102
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,696
that you couldn't have
done yesterday.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Quit my job.

104
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,896
You could've
done that yesterday,

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,976
but it would've been stupid.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,896
- I can quit today and...
- It'd still be stupid.

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,069
You clear your college debt

108
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,878
and celebrate by
enrolling in post-grad?

109
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,792
Academia's more my scene.

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,256
You didn't follow me
into the crapper

111
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,271
to gloat about freedom, Jane.

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,749
Talk to me about
the Nutella Tax.

113
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,751
Uh, we're really calling it
the "Nutella Tax"?

114
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,592
Palm oil is a key ingredient
in Nutella.

115
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,832
If the Federal Government
taxes it at 300%,

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,476
it'll cost more for us
to gorge ourselves on it.

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,031
Isn't palm oil in
pretty much everything?

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,120
We could have called it
the Soap Tax,

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,376
but the public cares
more about Nutella

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
than they do soap.

121
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
Anyway, we get
four more senators

122
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,600
to come out against the bill,

123
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
we can lean on Jacobs
to withdraw it.

124
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,349
What are you gonna do?

125
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Tell the Indonesians they're
going to host Senator Jacobs

126
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,396
on a field trip to
one of their plantations.

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,277
You never washed your hands.

128
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,436
He'll take the wife and kids
on a tropical vacation.

129
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,034
Come back hailing
their conservation efforts.

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,551
His bill dies a quiet death.

131
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,296
If the Indonesian
government pays for it,

132
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,389
it's illegal.

133
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,755
If they use a non-profit c3
to sponsor the travel,

134
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,239
it's perfectly legal.

135
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,200
As long as the trip
is for educational purposes.

136
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,675
But, the Indonesian government
is still paying for it.

137
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,149
See, this is why I'm thinking
about post-grad.

138
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Jane, we go to school to
prepare us for the real world.

139
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,359
I'm not sure
I like the real world.

140
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,016
So you want to bury
your head in Socrates?

141
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,873
You know that Socrates
never actually wrote anything.

142
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,915
That's beside the point.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,513
If you don't like it,
you change it.

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,636
- That's why you're here.
- Miss Sloane!

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,456
They're ready for you
in the conference room.

146
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,456
Hey, Spencer, did you know
that Americans care more

147
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,596
about Nutella than
they do about soap?

148
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,388
Uh, okay.

149
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,035
See that?

150
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,754
No reaction.

151
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,776
Okay, guys, we
gotta be quick this morning,

152
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,153
I've got a meeting to get to.

153
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,151
How many are they
expecting at the IMF rally?

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,434
Between 500 and 1,000.

155
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,351
There's a margin of 100%?

156
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,416
Does that technically mean
that nobody might show up?

157
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,874
Five hundred's the minimum,
the rest depends on weather.

158
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,871
Seems more people hate
banks when the sun's out.

159
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,576
- What's the weather forecast?
- Liz?

160
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,736
Time we sold Jacobs
on Indonesia.

161
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,829
I know.

162
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,434
- When Henry falls we've got...
- Critical mass, I'm aware.

163
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,795
Get a non-profit
to sponsor a vacation.

164
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,871
They give him face
and he'll pull it.

165
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,030
Did you just come from
the ladies' room?

166
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,016
Uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

167
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,976
We're talking about
numbers at the IMF rally.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,036
All right, Alex,
put Metro Talent on notice,

169
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,076
- we may need reinforcements.
- I'm on it.

170
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,336
We're really gonna
use movie extras?

171
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,776
The guy shouting about
corporate greed

172
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,438
becomes a lot less
credible standing next

173
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,033
to a hobo from central casting,

174
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,515
with a banner that reads,
"Abolish money."

175
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,749
"Shit is fucked up

176
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,193
"and bullshit."

177
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,994
Best banner at Occupy.
Tell me that was one of ours.

178
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,719
Oh, no, that was creative
way beyond my capabilities.

179
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,792
- Franklin! Shmallow Cakes?
- Uh, yeah!

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,416
Does sales tax apply
to cakes and cookies,

181
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
or only to one of those?

182
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,471
I don't know.

183
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,955
You don't know?

184
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,576
All right, everybody, listen up!

185
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,776
I'm going to tell you a story.

186
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,835
Please, no.

187
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,216
A priest is
giving a young nun

188
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,639
a lift home from
church one day,

189
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,312
and as he's shifting gears,

190
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,960
he rests his hand
on the nun's knee.

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,736
This is offensive
and inappropriate.

192
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,296
The young nun looks up
at the priest and says,

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,118
"Father, remember Luke 14:10."

194
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,837
The priest withdraws his hand,
embarrassed.

195
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,792
Next time
they stop at a light,

196
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,554
he places his hand a little
higher up on her thigh,

197
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,110
again the nun says,
"Remember Luke 14:10, Father."

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,079
The priest apologizes.

199
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,435
"The flesh is weak," he says.

200
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,256
So he drops her off,
and when he gets home,

201
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,909
he reaches for his bible
and he flips to Luke 14:10.

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,558
Anyone know what it says? Hmm?

203
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,553
What does it say, Pat?

204
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,276
"Friend, come up higher,
then shalt thou have glory!"

205
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,436
Know your subject, people!

206
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,833
Failure to do so may result

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,478
in the loss of
a golden opportunity.

208
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,278
When I see you this afternoon,

209
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,416
you'd better be
ready to recite

210
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,590
that tax code in Esperanto.

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,669
I'm... I'm told I should
offer her my hand, huh?

212
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,278
How do you mean?

213
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,997
Well, when we meet,
I'm told that

214
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,072
she doesn't care for
all that kissy-kissy stuff

215
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,469
that most women do these days.

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,915
You two
have never met?

217
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,434
Well, we've been to several
of the same functions, yeah,

218
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,039
but we've never
been introduced.

219
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,634
In a town this small,
how does that happen?

220
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,715
So, should I
offer my hand?

221
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,120
I wouldn't
worry about it.

222
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,796
- Liz?
- Good morning!

223
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,234
Bill Sandford.

224
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,753
I'm amazed
it's taken this long.

225
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,110
Well, you know, I wanted
to introduce myself

226
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
at the Free Enterprise Dinner,

227
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,114
but you were the first one
out the door.

228
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,997
Minor crisis on the Hill.

229
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,749
Well, a lesser commander

230
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,353
would've left that
to a soldier,

231
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,192
which is the reason I'm here.

232
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,236
Why exactly are you here?

233
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,151
Killing bills
like Heaton-Harris,

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,798
that's food and drink
to you guys.

235
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,110
- So you've read it?
- No, but I know what it is.

236
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,758
It's a bipartisan gun bill

237
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,353
requiring universal
background checks.

238
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,792
On all sales of firearms.

239
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,199
Now, come on.

240
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,511
A father and his son,
lifelong friends.

241
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,319
It just means longer delays.

242
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,311
It's some kind of
Big Brother type criminal

243
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,231
and mental health database.

244
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,039
An unconstitutional fetter
on the Second Amendment

245
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,991
which, as you said,

246
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,753
we will eat for breakfast.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,355
Mr. Sandford, I deal
primarily in taxation

248
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,976
and Federal Government
interference

249
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,080
in free enterprise. This...

250
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,678
I'm aware, I am aware.

251
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
But I'll tell you,

252
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,431
the reputation you have
garnered for yourself,

253
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,909
we were just looking for
an excuse to engage you.

254
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,313
Okay. Let's have it.

255
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,554
Women.

256
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,033
Our polling data is telling us

257
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,156
that we're not connecting
with the female voter.

258
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,269
So, we want to change
the narrative.

259
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,511
From mothers losing
their kids to guns,

260
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,239
to mothers protecting
their kids with guns.

261
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,794
From a battered wife
threatened by a bullet,

262
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,475
to fending off her
violent husband with a.38.

263
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,634
Guns as tools
of female empowerment.

264
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,637
What's the saying?
God created humans...

265
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,513
Samuel Colt made them equal.

266
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,909
Now, Liz, imagine
a new organization,

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,468
pitched at women
who are deterred

268
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,233
by the strong rhetoric of the
Second Amendment groups,

269
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,193
and by our association
with the political right.

270
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,757
But no links to us,
no baggage.

271
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,836
No overt position on guns.

272
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,508
And you

273
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,517
will build it up,
you will drive its agenda,

274
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,398
and slowly but surely,

275
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,151
you will turn those members

276
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,916
into paid-up guardians
of the Second Amendment.

277
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,958
So, what? Um...

278
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,508
Mothers For A Safer America...

279
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,592
Achieved by making sure

280
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,910
every last citizen is
armed to the teeth?

281
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Liz?

282
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,311
Jesus, is this the reputation
I've garnered?

283
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,311
Gold medalist
in ethical limbo?

284
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,834
I see no ethical problem
with reframing an issue.

285
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,753
Trying to win the female vote
by taking the gun lobby

286
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,956
and dressing it up
in a frilly pink frock,

287
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,075
it is so crude,

288
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,360
it could only have originated
in a room full of old men.

289
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, it didn't!

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,479
This is my own idea.

291
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,710
Well, my advice
is to kill it in utero.

292
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,718
You'll need more
than the trite wisdom

293
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,074
that we value security

294
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,594
to get us behind your views
on the Second Amendment.

295
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,879
Well, the fact remains

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,520
that when it comes
to the female voter,

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,638
our numbers need to be better.

298
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,389
I see.

299
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,317
Well, why don't I take
a look at the numbers

300
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,992
and then we'll proceed
from there?

301
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,176
Who the hell
does she think she is?

302
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,315
It can be spun.

303
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,680
For the purpose of
gaining trust,

304
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,136
it may've been
the right tactical move.

305
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,549
And do you believe,
for one nanosecond,

306
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,596
that was at the forefront
of her mind

307
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,160
when she told him
to take his business

308
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,993
and shove it up
his gun barrel?

309
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Candice!

310
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,918
I want Sloane
in my office now!

311
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,994
She's good, isn't she?

312
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,559
You'll look at the numbers?

313
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,509
I'm sure the president

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,478
of one of the most powerful
groups on the Hill

315
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,232
will be honored
that Her Majesty

316
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,754
has agreed to look
at the fucking numbers!

317
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,953
What's going on with you?

318
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,837
The current system
is so porous, it floats.

319
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,751
I don't remember
you caring, ever,

320
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,671
one way or another about guns!

321
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,398
My position solidified
somewhere

322
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,311
between Columbine
and Charleston.

323
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,397
Come on, George,
any head-case,

324
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,875
felon or terrorist can
buy an assault rifle

325
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,359
from a gun show, the Internet,

326
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,914
or his buddy
at the Bowl-O-Rama

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,468
without so much as an ID.

328
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,856
Heaton-Harris
puts a stop to that.

329
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,791
Christ, Liz,
this is the gun lobby.

330
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,949
Do you have any idea

331
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,680
how long I've been trying
to reel them in?

332
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,548
No.

333
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,709
Something happened.

334
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,720
Someone you know
was the victim of a gun crime.

335
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,155
Nonsense.
I just formed an opinion.

336
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,670
You're the champion
of the free market.

337
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,077
You abhor frivolous
government intervention...

338
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,309
I would hardly categorize

339
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,776
responsible gun laws
as frivolous...

340
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,915
Indonesians!

341
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,876
For Christ's sake,
you rep Indonesians!

342
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,752
To stop our government
from looting

343
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,239
one of their
few sources of income.

344
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,673
And what is wrong
with Indonesia?

345
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,816
We're about to
secure Al Jacobs

346
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,114
with a field trip there.

347
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,713
Is that a promise or a threat?

348
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,559
I can just picture
the good Senator

349
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,039
being boiled in a cauldron

350
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,395
with all these natives
dancing around him.

351
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,479
Get back to
your Fortune 500 clients.

352
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,915
Your colorful interventions
are the cause of

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,753
a lot of industry backchat
this firm could do without.

354
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,717
I work on behalf of
causes I believe in.

355
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,153
That's how I sleep at night.

356
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,918
You don't sleep at night.

357
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,389
You sit and obsess
about winning,

358
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,239
no matter the cause.

359
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,673
Those little pills
in your purse

360
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,472
are not the kind that
lull you to sleep.

361
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,951
The only reason you

362
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,238
and your team of gum-chewing
ragamuffins are here

363
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,036
is that your arrogant pranks
might generate enough buzz

364
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,270
to attract clients
like Bill Sandford.

365
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,793
Meaning, if you don't dedicate
yourself to his cause,

366
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,350
this firm won't have
any use for you.

367
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,511
Now go away,
look into those numbers,

368
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,272
and start getting
women into guns.

369
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,272
- Any dizziness? Nausea?
- No.

370
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,999
That's what you always say.

371
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,513
Doctor, I'm fine.

372
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,096
If my insurance company
weren't such sticklers,

373
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,880
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

374
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,280
What time are you
getting to sleep?

375
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,629
I sleep a lot, it varies.

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,797
What time did you get to
sleep last night?

377
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,268
Did you get any sleep at all?

378
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,509
These are busy times.

379
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,875
You don't need
a doctor to tell you

380
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,880
that you're working yourself
into an early grave.

381
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,554
The long hours...

382
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,816
Okay, when you
called me just now,

383
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,068
what number did you dial?

384
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,229
Your home number.

385
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,856
Cell is off,
cocoa is on the stove,

386
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,074
book is at my bedside.

387
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,679
I'll be asleep
in under two hours.

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,479
Thanks for calling, Doctor.

389
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,816
In the Republican party,

390
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,240
he can help you out
in California...

391
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,874
Okay!

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,319
Good, welcome.

393
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,072
Yes! Yeah.

394
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,992
I want you to meet
Senator Davidson.

395
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,992
Yes. I appreciate you coming
to every fundraiser.

396
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,873
Yeah, I'll be right back.

397
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,318
Hello! I expect to
see you next time.

398
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,753
Yes. That would be great.

399
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,353
Yes, nice to see you.

400
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,874
Early night?

401
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,389
If you're looking for a quote,
you're wasting your time.

402
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,496
I've just watched you
extricate yourself

403
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,669
from three conversations

404
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
to use the ladies' room
in the space of 30 minutes.

405
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,553
You busted me.
I'm incontinent. Write it up.

406
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,035
I hope I'm wrong,

407
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,696
but one might think
you're sick of this town.

408
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,029
You from the Post?
How did you get in?

409
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,720
I'd just like five minutes
of your time.

410
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Fine.

411
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,115
Walk to my car is three,
get to the point.

412
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,616
The word on the Hill
is that the gun lobby

413
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,993
approached you
over Heaton-Harris

414
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,229
and you refused.

415
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,951
I don't comment on
"word on the Hill."

416
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,519
I know the only way
you'd do that

417
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,318
is if you support the bill.

418
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,719
That's quite a story.

419
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,678
Turning down
a prized client because

420
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,352
you can't accept
what they stand for.

421
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,315
Elizabeth Sloane, the
conviction lobbyist. Who knew?

422
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,320
I said, get to the point.

423
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,315
Will you admit
the present system is broken?

424
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,271
I remain committed
to the Second Amendment.

425
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,751
Dildos are illegal in Texas,

426
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,796
but Joe Public can
walk into a sports store

427
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,154
and walk out with a shotgun.

428
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,793
That would explain
the low rate

429
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,438
of dildo-related
murders in Texas.

430
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,872
Okay, it wasn't that funny.

431
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,993
What do you want?

432
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,308
Your quote.

433
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,271
Fine. A conviction lobbyist

434
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,954
need only believe
in their ability to win.

435
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,395
That's a keeper.

436
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,112
One more thing,
off the record.

437
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,496
- Mmm-hmm.
- What do you know about

438
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,256
- the gun lobby's opponents?
- The Brady Campaign?

439
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,256
I know they're going to lose
because their total budget

440
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,536
is less than what
the gun lobby pays

441
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,600
to get their shoes shined.

442
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,958
What about their lobbyists,
Peterson Wyatt?

443
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,475
They're a boutique bipartisan
Government Affairs agency.

444
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,956
"Boutique" is a euphemism
for "little fish."

445
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,315
"Bipartisan" denotes
a bunch of hippies in suits.

446
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,313
Do you know anything
about their CEO?

447
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,555
Guy named Schmidt?

448
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,959
No, never heard of him.

449
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,554
But if the firm is built
in his image,

450
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,840
I'm sure he's a simpering wuss

451
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,478
with a Ph.D in
style-over-substance.

452
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Got it.

453
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,631
I never introduced myself,
by the way.

454
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,834
My name's Rodolfo Schmidt,

455
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,989
CEO of Peterson Wyatt.

456
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
What's the matter?

457
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,440
Am I not simpering
hard enough?

458
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,228
Your firm's 12 years old,

459
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,976
I'd think your name
would be Peterson or...

460
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,399
What...

461
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,273
What is this about?

462
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,433
You're pro-Heaton-Harris.

463
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,520
It's an open secret

464
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,976
you're at war with
your firm's leadership.

465
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,353
The Brady Campaign wants you

466
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,839
to lead the fight
to pass the bill.

467
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,832
You'd run defense
out of our office.

468
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,279
When it's over,

469
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,191
you can choose from
any of the D.C. behemoths

470
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,668
lining up for your signature.

471
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,229
This is Peterson Wyatt's quote
for your services.

472
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,677
I don't know
if I should be flattered

473
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,869
or insulted, Mr. Schmidt,

474
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,275
but you clearly have
the wrong opinion of me.

475
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,280
I think my opinion
of you is right on.

476
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,960
Don't tell me you don't want
to take a swing at this.

477
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,149
Goodbye, Mr. Schmidt.

478
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,555
Where's your car?

479
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,756
Should be at the valet by now.
I don't drive.

480
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,559
Hi, Jane?

481
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,240
Yeah, I know what time it is.

482
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,034
Listen...

483
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,512
If, uh, Socrates never
wrote anything,

484
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,231
how is it anyone's
ever heard of him?

485
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,954
Look, we need a meeting.

486
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,736
Where are they putting
Senator Jacobs?

487
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
The Lombok Lodge?

488
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,909
Yes.

489
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,439
- It's on the beach?
- Yes.

490
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,794
Good.

491
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,736
This goes off to
the Senate Ethics Committee.

492
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,896
Once they authorize
the travel,

493
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,035
Jacobs is on a plane.

494
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,031
- Is that okay?
- It's fine.

495
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,270
- Technically, I mean?
- Don't worry about it.

496
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,277
It's just... As lobbyists,
we can't be involved

497
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,516
in arranging overseas travel
for members of Congress.

498
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,191
I read ethics regs when
I want to look busy.

499
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,096
If you weren't just
pretending to be busy,

500
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,216
you'd know that the workaround

501
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,336
is to get this
to the non-profit,

502
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,555
have them sign and file
with the Ethics Committee.

503
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,358
Do I seem unduly concerned?

504
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,949
Okay.

505
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,554
George told me
what happened with Sandford.

506
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,993
- Mmm.
- Are you retarded?

507
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,400
Why are you eating
a chocolate cake for breakfast?

508
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,198
- Have you no shame?
- It's a muffin.

509
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,552
You never had
a muffin for breakfast?

510
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,868
A muffin, let's see.

511
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,633
Eggs, milk, flour, sugar,
cocoa powder, chocolate.

512
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,676
That sounds exactly like
a cake, but of course,

513
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,718
no civilized person
would ever eat

514
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,313
a chocolate cake
for breakfast.

515
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,909
You've lost your mind.

516
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,558
Franklin,
are you getting this?

517
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,920
'Cause I'm really
talking to you.

518
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,995
Huh?

519
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,456
Shmallow Cakes
aren't really cakes.

520
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,152
They're marshmallow
paste sandwiched

521
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,816
between two cookies
covered in chocolate.

522
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,239
And while our tax code
deems cakes

523
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,830
luxury items
and hits them harder,

524
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,469
cookies are obviously
necessities,

525
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,789
and therefore exempt.

526
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,394
- Are you getting this?
- What?

527
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,511
Have Shmallow Cakes
re-designated as cookies,

528
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,915
argue cake in the name
is merely marketing puff.

529
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,513
You'll need evidence in court,

530
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,080
but get a team
of scientists to opine

531
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,632
that they are in fact 80%
cookie and zero percent cake.

532
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,349
That's how you win.

533
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,136
You knew that
all along?

534
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,832
You would have
got there eventually.

535
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,096
Then why are you
telling me this?

536
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,519
In case you're not
coming with me.

537
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,112
What's going on?

538
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,349
All right, everyone.

539
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,496
I called you here
to announce that,

540
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
effective immediately,

541
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,710
I am leaving Cole Kravitz

542
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,353
and starting work
as lead consultant

543
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,550
for the Brady Campaign
at Peterson Wyatt.

544
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,394
I've secured positions
for everyone in this room

545
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,551
without change to
your current compensation.

546
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,114
So, who's with me on this?

547
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,875
I just spent the last hour
wiping your shit

548
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,428
off Bill Sandford's shoes,

549
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,232
assuring him that
you're the right lady

550
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,719
to broaden his membership!

551
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,556
We're inches from
a green fucking light!

552
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
So, you're saying I should
put you down as a maybe?

553
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,470
You can't possibly win this!

554
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,793
Who's with me?

555
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,115
I'm with you.

556
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,835
Whoa, whoa, Ross,
hey, come on, I need you.

557
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,069
She needs me more.

558
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,594
Alex?

559
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,669
Lauren?

560
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,555
The fuck is this?
Jerry Maguire?

561
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,035
You've seen Jerry Maguire?

562
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,754
Guns frighten me.

563
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,273
So, Sloane and Co.
versus Connors and who else?

564
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,670
Mmm. O'Hara, Wickman,
Moore, the God Squad.

565
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,155
Ramirez,

566
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,952
how many Tec-9s
do you own again?

567
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,200
Enough to defend my property.

568
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,433
Plus two more
to piss off the lefties.

569
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
All right, Jane,

570
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,416
contact Rodolfo Schmidt
at Peterson Wyatt,

571
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,320
and tell him there's
a total of six coming over.

572
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,834
I count five.

573
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,279
Mathematician
you are not.

574
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,189
Who said I was coming?

575
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,474
I did. Call Rodolfo.

576
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,269
What if I'm staying?

577
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,712
Jesus, now is not
the time to develop

578
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,519
a sense of humor, Jane.

579
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,591
That's good, 'cause I'm not.

580
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,038
Seriously, kid, go.

581
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,709
I could care less.

582
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,594
You were right before.

583
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,558
About post-grad.
Maybe it is a cop-out.

584
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,437
I'm at one of the best firms
in the city.

585
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,676
Your reputation
might survive a move

586
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,628
to some third-tier outfit
to fight a losing battle.

587
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,153
Mine won't.

588
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,275
No shit.

589
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,319
I take it back.

590
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,992
I've learned a lot from you
these last couple years, Liz.

591
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,159
I'll miss you.

592
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,832
The 3:00 a.m. wake-up calls?

593
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,673
Not so much.

594
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,151
You've obviously learned
more than you let on.

595
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,676
You've shown more ambition
in the last 60 seconds

596
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,990
than I've seen
in the prior two years,

597
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,314
but you are delusional

598
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,036
if you think you can
survive without me.

599
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,519
If we butt heads on this,

600
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,795
don't think I'll show you
any compassion.

601
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,748
And with that in mind,

602
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,553
I will give you a final
opportunity to reconsider.

603
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,198
All right. I'm off to say my goodbye
to the money-man.

604
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,790
When this town guts you
like a trout

605
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,950
and chokes you
with your own entrails,

606
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,110
don't come sniveling to me.

607
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,393
We'll come back

608
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,596
to the Asian Republic
of Indonesia later,

609
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,555
but, you see, what troubles me

610
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,712
is the amount
of influence you had.

611
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,917
We've seen communications

612
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,713
from senior figures
in Washington

613
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,755
who feared that you,
a lobbyist,

614
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,073
could destroy their careers
with a snap of your fingers.

615
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,832
Is this reputation something

616
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,273
you've cultivated,
Miss Sloane?

617
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,468
Upon the advice of counsel,

618
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,600
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

619
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,480
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

620
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,351
to the United States
Constitution.

621
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,272
You see, it's bad enough
one person

622
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,191
having that much influence,

623
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,434
but if they're out of control,
if she has a problem,

624
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,830
an addiction, well,

625
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,315
it would be like the ship
of American politics

626
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,119
is being steered by a drunk.

627
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,797
Do you, or have you ever had,

628
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,111
any problems with
substance abuse?

629
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,119
Upon the advice of counsel,

630
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,634
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

631
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,480
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

632
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,920
to the United States
Constitution.

633
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,120
I understand you have difficulty sleeping?

634
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,112
We subpoenaed medical records.

635
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,638
You're a long-time sufferer
from chronic insomnia.

636
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,471
You regularly work
over 16 hours a day.

637
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,592
But you can't get off
to sleep. Is this accurate?

638
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,309
Upon the advice of counsel,
I respectfully...

639
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,630
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

640
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,637
based on my rights under

641
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,400
the Fifth Amendment
of the United States...

642
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,634
To the Constitution.

643
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,074
Whatever.

644
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
You were prescribed

645
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,312
multiple courses
of benzodiazepines,

646
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,096
but according to
the deposition

647
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,394
of one of our witnesses,

648
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,592
you've been procuring,
off-prescription,

649
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,750
a course of psycho-stimulants,

650
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,597
with the aim of keeping you
awake a little longer.

651
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,793
Is this true?

652
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,199
Miss Sloane?

653
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,560
Upon the advice of counsel,

654
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,416
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,

655
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,976
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment

656
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,672
to the United States
Constitution.

657
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,670
Okay. Getting back
to this business

658
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,352
of the Asian Republic
of Indonesia...

659
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,959
I am not a drug addict,

660
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,190
and this line of questioning
has no revel...

661
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,793
Relevance in this case.

662
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,518
My medication doesn't
affect my judgment

663
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,278
any more than
a double espresso.

664
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,555
And speaking of intoxication,

665
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,113
I can recite from memory

666
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,634
a list of upstanding,
elected Senators

667
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,030
who voted on legislation
while severely inebriated.

668
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,555
And just so you know,
I think, by now,

669
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,029
we are fully aware,

670
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,310
and in no danger
of forgetting,

671
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,630
that Indonesia is a republic,

672
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,554
which happens to be situated
on the continent of Asia.

673
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,869
Miss Sloane.

674
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,073
Welcome to the party.

675
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,913
Five years.

676
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,874
Was it really worth it?

677
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,397
- Five years minimum.
- What's five years?

678
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,757
All for some puerile quip
about Indonesia being in Asia.

679
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,510
Can't you see that whole
construct was designed to...

680
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
And it worked.

681
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,072
Are you gonna tell me
what five years is?

682
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,355
You fell for it.

683
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,678
The smartest operative
on the Hill

684
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,352
just got played
by Grampa Simpson!

685
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,536
Is it how long
this conversation's

686
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,595
gonna feel like?

687
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,592
It's the going rate for
perjury before Congress.

688
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
Now you've
thrown out the Fifth,

689
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,359
anyone who wants you
in the ground,

690
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,874
and that's a lot of people,
they're hard at work

691
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,190
dedicating their creative
and intellectual efforts

692
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,599
to catching you in a lie.

693
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,109
Well, what if I just
stay silent?

694
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,112
Well, that's a great idea.

695
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,856
Shit, why didn't your lawyer
think of that?

696
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,029
If I refuse to answer...

697
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,189
They'll throw you in jail

698
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,713
- for contempt of Congress!
- Shh!

699
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,351
You've just blown
this thing wide open!

700
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,549
Calm down, Daniel.

701
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,440
You're starting
to look like you care.

702
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,629
No.

703
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
I don't care about you

704
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,080
any further than
I can throw you.

705
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,234
I work for the one ethical
lobbying practice on the Hill,

706
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,550
and I wind up defending
the poster child

707
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,039
for the most morally bankrupt

708
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,360
profession since
faith healing.

709
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,296
Your car's downstairs.

710
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,995
Go home, stare at the ceiling,
get ready to be crucified.

711
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,216
I know I don't have
the most stellar record

712
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,309
in heeding your advice...

713
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,998
Don't perjure yourself!

714
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,240
Too bad things didn't
pan out with Elizabeth.

715
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,158
Oh, we have other options.

716
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,831
What the hell is
"Amish chicken"?

717
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,518
A marketing exercise?

718
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,400
No, we'll just try and find
ourselves another lobbyist.

719
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,275
I was talking about
the Amish chicken.

720
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Oh.

721
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,599
She's your enemy now.

722
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,591
I invited you here
because nobody

723
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,830
is better placed
to neutralize her than us.

724
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,160
We worked together for years.

725
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,518
We know exactly
how she operates.

726
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,873
Oh, that is just
a regular bird

727
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,336
raised in Amish country,
by the way.

728
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Ah.

729
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,120
It tastes better because
it can't use Google, huh?

730
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,176
Look, there's over
five million of us.

731
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,349
And we're armed.

732
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,116
We've beaten
this kind of bill before,

733
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,679
we'll beat it again.

734
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,952
They'll make a lot of noise,

735
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,191
they'll wave their banners,
but in the end

736
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,514
it's so predictable.

737
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,558
She's not predictable.

738
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,231
She aims to surprise.

739
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,280
She'll share things
with her team,

740
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,560
but she won't
share everything.

741
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,638
She'll have a plan
for certain people,

742
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,472
but they won't know
until they're dropped

743
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,680
right into the middle of it.

744
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,896
There's always something
else going on with her.

745
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,069
It's just how she works.

746
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,196
We have a good idea
which Senators she'll go for

747
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,388
and we can get in first.

748
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,752
And they're vulnerable
on other members

749
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,896
they're already counting on.

750
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,035
Badgley, Michigan.

751
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,876
He can bring maybe six votes.

752
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,231
We get to him,
it's a quick win.

753
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,909
All right.

754
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,079
Show me some tradecraft.

755
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,115
- Filet mignon, rare.
- Same, well done.

756
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,954
Well done too.

757
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,355
The Arctic char.

758
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,238
Amish chicken salad, please.

759
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,239
Excuse me.

760
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,114
That kind of insight is
exactly why you're here.

761
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,909
I'm sorry,
who closed him again?

762
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,753
Who the hell are you?

763
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,674
Evening, ma'am.

764
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,798
What happened to
the usual guy? Mark.

765
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,718
If that's his real name.

766
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,718
Mark's moved on.

767
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,474
Call me Forde.

768
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,954
Is that your real name?

769
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,549
Is to you.

770
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,832
- How about you, gorgeous?
- Oh, God.

771
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,151
You a politico, or one of
these corporate-types?

772
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,550
What brings a fine lady
like you to room 904?

773
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,468
Not the conversation.
How much you had to drink?

774
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,074
Well, a free minibar,
I'd say not nearly enough.

775
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,832
You're not allowed
to smoke in here.

776
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,880
You're not allowed
to buy company in here,

777
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,273
yet here you are.

778
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,679
Smoke is detectable.

779
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,831
It could draw attention.
It is unprofessional.

780
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,188
Okay.

781
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,036
Corporate-type. Lawyer, maybe.

782
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,348
If we're going to proceed,

783
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,038
I require
a certain standard of...

784
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,314
Agency rules, lady.

785
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,040
Payment in cash,
I'm the only one

786
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,880
to know this little party
here ever happened.

787
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,116
And that's with half a minibar
down my gullet.

788
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,680
I understand if you were
looking for something else.

789
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,233
You'll do fine.

790
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,989
Let's get to the point.

791
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,628
All right.

792
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,840
Hey, I hope you guys don't
feel like you're slumming.

793
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,553
I thought it'd be weirder.

794
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,631
Bean bags,
couple swings, maybe.

795
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,336
At least tell me you guys
have shower rooms.

796
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,998
Cole Kravitz had shower rooms?

797
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,176
Clients felt like
they needed one

798
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,315
after 30 minutes with him.

799
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,630
We had all the facilities,
and no time to use them.

800
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
This'll do fine.

801
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,598
The vending machine
downstairs is weird.

802
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,040
Wouldn't give me my beverage

803
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,640
until I told it my gender
and age range.

804
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,159
The vending machine
company sells

805
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,456
our personal details
to Big Advertising.

806
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,311
I already posted a complaint.

807
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,594
It's okay, I just lied.

808
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,233
You told it you were
an adult male?

809
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,918
Why are you
so horrible to him?

810
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,752
Jacobs just pulled
the Nutella Tax.

811
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,440
- When did that happen?
- I just got it.

812
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
The tax on palm oil?
You're the ones who killed it?

813
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,669
Dead with the dodo.

814
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,016
Along with how many
other unique species

815
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,200
in the Indonesian rainforest?

816
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,599
Not your greatest
analogy there.

817
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,480
I guess it should
be up to them,

818
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,192
I mean, it is, after all,
their country.

819
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,256
Do you know how much pollution
their slashing and burning

820
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,429
pumps into the atmosphere?

821
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,353
Less than 0.2% of global
greenhouse emissions.

822
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,590
- So, are the rumors true?
- Yes.

823
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,278
Ross is really a woman.

824
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,035
Is Sloane the personification
of an ice cube?

825
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,519
She pees standing up.

826
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,556
And, like...
I don't even do that.

827
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,199
Do you think before you speak?

828
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,793
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

829
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,955
- Morning.
- Morning.

830
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,640
I was thinking, perhaps,
we go around the table,

831
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,954
introduce ourselves.

832
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,632
Let's spare ourselves
the tedium.

833
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,029
If you want to break the ice,
do it with insight.

834
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,712
We're all here to ensure
safe passage

835
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,950
of the Heaton-Harris Bill
into Federal law.

836
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,794
How do we do it?

837
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,919
Realistically, we don't.

838
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,473
We fight as hard as we can,

839
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,158
build a strong base
of support,

840
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,389
so we have a better chance

841
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,056
when they introduce
next year's Heaton-Harris,

842
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,149
or the one after that.

843
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,468
I didn't just move across town

844
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,216
with the aim of losing
as slowly as possible.

845
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,559
Name and seniority?

846
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,316
Esme Manucharian, nine years.

847
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,237
Manucharian,
I've heard that name.

848
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,631
Esme's our authority
on gun control.

849
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,416
When it comes
to facts and figures,

850
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,475
she has no equal.

851
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,999
You led the fight to preserve

852
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,678
the concealed carry ban
in Illinois.

853
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,913
Ultimately unsuccessfully,
but, yes.

854
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,559
Okay, Esme.
Why are we going to lose?

855
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,909
For every dollar Brady spends
on campaign contributions,

856
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,376
you know how much
the gun lobby spends?

857
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,600
- Thirty-eight.
- Thirty-eight.

858
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,750
So, politicians bow
to money. But, why?

859
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,910
It's not going into their
pocket, that'd be bribery.

860
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,080
Like what the Indonesians
just did to Senator Jacobs?

861
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,456
That was legal bribery

862
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,993
for educational purposes.
But, yes.

863
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,634
A senator's priority
isn't representing the people,

864
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,159
it's keeping his ass
in office.

865
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
That is so cynical.

866
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,176
"Cynical" is a word
used by Pollyannas

867
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,031
to denote an absence
of the naivety

868
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,991
they so keenly exhibit.

869
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,475
Wow. You settle in fast.

870
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,109
If senators only care about
protecting their position,

871
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,869
wouldn't that make them
slaves to public opinion?

872
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,116
Polling data puts
a majority of Americans

873
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,428
in favor of Heaton-Harris.

874
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,676
And that's exactly why
you keep losing.

875
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,816
Well, this is actually
our first crack at guns,

876
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,875
but I take your point.

877
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,194
What point?

878
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,958
Public opinion is overrated.

879
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,952
Midterm re-election rates
for senators was 82%.

880
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,792
Voter turnout was 36.

881
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,976
And I'll bet most of them were

882
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,319
paid-up members
of the gun lobby.

883
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,469
Thank you.

884
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,312
Our opposition has created
a base of voters,

885
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,879
vast and fanatical,

886
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,234
who go out and vote
exclusively

887
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,395
on the issue of guns.

888
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,600
How do we compete with that?

889
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,238
We build our own base
of supporters,

890
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,456
who demonstrate a willingness

891
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,313
to get their asses into booths
and vote against guns.

892
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
What's the best indicator
of voter intention?

893
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,309
- Money!
- Finance!

894
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,753
That's our first prong.

895
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,239
Grassroots action

896
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,840
aimed squarely at
soliciting donations.

897
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,868
Not names on a petition,
not clicks in cyberspace.

898
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,216
Will they know
how much we're raising?

899
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,231
Non-profits have to
report on their finances.

900
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,999
And every
Congressional staffer

901
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,280
watches filing day
like a hawk.

902
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,594
While you're
out there hustling,

903
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,153
I'll be working
influential senators

904
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,912
who can deliver
their colleagues' votes.

905
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,513
That's our second prong.

906
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,158
Our third is to identify

907
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,271
who holds sway
in target states.

908
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,277
Employers, workers' groups.

909
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,749
Don't just waltz into
a senator's office

910
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,114
and make your case.

911
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,792
Find out who they trust,

912
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,508
who they can't afford
to piss off.

913
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,478
Convince that person
to make your case.

914
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,398
That is how we win.

915
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,278
Not a driver?

916
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,909
I can, but I don't.

917
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,359
Well, you got further than me,
I don't even have a license.

918
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,277
My bank account
and liberal conscience

919
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,713
won't justify my own car.

920
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,075
What's your excuse?

921
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,117
To be honest, I suck at it.

922
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,232
I took my test when I was 16.

923
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,878
Only exam I ever failed.

924
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,395
My instructor told me
I was reckless,

925
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,311
I lacked due care
and attention.

926
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,870
Knew then and there
I had a career in politics.

927
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,318
You weren't
messing around in there.

928
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,789
Did you know someone?

929
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,616
Someone who was
a victim of gun violence.

930
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,153
No, why does everyone
assume that?

931
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,159
Strong opinions, maybe?

932
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,056
As if I can only see
the merits of an argument

933
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,991
when I feel the effects
personally.

934
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,233
There was a Congressman,
I don't remember his name,

935
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,629
his whole career
he was against gay rights,

936
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,673
only to do a complete U-turn
when his brother came out.

937
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,360
What a well-reasoned
basis for an opinion.

938
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,477
Give him a gavel,
put him in a courthouse.

939
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Are you hungry?

940
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,836
You eat here
every night?

941
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,717
Pretty much.
Place never closes.

942
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,359
How do you
not get bored of it?

943
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,875
It's a necessity.

944
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,120
It's like asking if I get
bored of going to the toilet.

945
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,636
Okay, this is going to
sound alien to you,

946
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,792
but food takes up an inordinate
amount of space in my head.

947
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,554
How about guns?

948
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,040
In doing my due diligence,
your résumé stood out.

949
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,591
I noticed a lot of your work
pertains to firearms.

950
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,477
I'm guessing that was
a conscious decision

951
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,278
to steer things
in that direction.

952
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,275
It's an issue I feel
strongly about.

953
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,829
It's none of my business,

954
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,320
but there was a gap
in your profile.

955
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,631
Before Berkeley,
you attended high school

956
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,392
in Bloomington, Indiana,
in the late '90s.

957
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,916
The name of the school
isn't listed.

958
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,999
Who else knows about this?

959
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,516
Rodolfo. That's all.

960
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,456
You can imagine
what I'm thinking.

961
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,871
I'm sorry, Elizabeth,
but I earned my reputation.

962
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,336
It didn't come from something

963
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,656
that happened when
I was in high school.

964
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,671
Even if my views did.

965
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,376
Going public could even
weaken my standing.

966
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,879
They'll say I'm too emotional.

967
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,759
Anyway, the shooters
didn't even buy their guns.

968
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,239
Heaton-Harris
wouldn't have made

969
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,520
a shred of
difference that day.

970
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,155
You fear a weakened standing
will damage your ability to effect change.

971
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,471
But if acknowledging it
was the difference

972
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,118
between winning and losing?

973
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,637
I'd appreciate it
if you just treated me

974
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,948
as one of the team.

975
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,515
A highly competent one,
I can tell.

976
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,349
We're lucky to have you.

977
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,029
Sixty is the magic number.

978
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,031
Sixty votes
breaks a filibuster.

979
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,758
So, the gun lobby
wins with 41?

980
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,353
They could win
with fewer.

981
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,159
We need to hit 60.
Anything less doesn't cut it.

982
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,594
Fifty-nine doesn't cut it.

983
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,236
We need 60 senators
to show up and vote.

984
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,392
We don't get that,
they win, period.

985
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,514
As I was saying...

986
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,517
That by my reckoning,
the gun lobby

987
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,273
has 34 votes
pretty much locked.

988
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,874
And that's this side.

989
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,834
I'd say we have 44 locked
over here on this side.

990
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,880
That leaves 22
that are still in play.

991
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,509
These fine ladies and
gentlemen in the middle.

992
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,068
Heaton-Harris, provisionally,

993
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,151
makes it to the floor
in 84 days.

994
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,148
The good news is,

995
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,316
if we can lock 16,
we're over the line.

996
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,834
I'm sorry,
that's the good news?

997
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,678
We need 16 out of 22 votes?

998
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,976
That's like sitting an exam
where the passing grade is...

999
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
72%.

1000
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,680
And the bad news
is that the gun lobby

1001
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,233
is rich beyond
our wildest dreams?

1002
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
There is that.

1003
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,136
Or that it's not
a whole lot of time

1004
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,256
to steal 16 votes from the
most powerful group in D.C.?

1005
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,429
That, too.

1006
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,875
What Ross is fumbling for is,
we need 16.

1007
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,553
They only need seven.

1008
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,435
Shit.

1009
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,709
...and the man who did this

1010
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,191
robbed us of their smiles,
of their laughter.

1011
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,392
And I just can't accept
that we allowed it to happen.

1012
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,515
Our beautiful girls,
and we could have stopped it.

1013
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,828
We could have taken the gun

1014
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,160
out of his hand
and my babies...

1015
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,798
Jesus Christ.

1016
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
We get the idea.

1017
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,116
Brenda and Joel Patterson.

1018
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,713
The shooting sparked
a new wave

1019
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,438
of anti-gun sentiment
in Wisconsin.

1020
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,176
And that was
more than a month ago.

1021
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,235
It's not dying down.

1022
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,151
Brenda's become
a prominent figure

1023
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,720
in the Mothers Demand
Action movement.

1024
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,758
Public outrage
after a gun attack

1025
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,559
lasts maybe
a week per casualty.

1026
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,194
This whole Pattinson story
should be in the ground by now.

1027
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,316
- Patterson.
- Huh?

1028
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,470
Their name.
The Patterson family.

1029
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,920
I don't give a shit if they're
the fucking Partridge Family.

1030
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,228
This is her.

1031
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,560
Sandford
needs to know.

1032
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,955
Our delivery must be tailored
for maximum impact.

1033
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,032
Support for gun control is up
8% in the last two weeks.

1034
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,951
Both Wisconsin senators
are vulnerable.

1035
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,758
If they don't declare
for Heaton-Harris,

1036
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,456
Kirkpatrick won't make it
through the fall,

1037
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,656
and Wallace is toast
in two years...

1038
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,113
Who's going to that
medical thing?

1039
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280
Senator Wallace.

1040
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,998
He can deliver
two other moderates.

1041
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,913
And sure as she was
born screaming,

1042
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,639
she'll see that as her chance
to box them in.

1043
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,478
No, Carlos,
that's unacceptable.

1044
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,552
The media has to be there,
that's the whole point.

1045
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,148
It has to be digitally stored
and ready to be trotted out

1046
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,674
should he even think
about backing down.

1047
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,512
I'm gonna send you a photo
of Clara Thomson.

1048
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,999
She'll be front-left,
wearing a...

1049
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,136
Clara, what are you wearing?

1050
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,256
One-shoulder
black crepe dress.

1051
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,111
A one-shoulder
black crepe dress.

1052
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,160
If we're lucky, it'll be
the only one in the room.

1053
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,394
Thanks, Carlos.

1054
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,869
Hey, Alex, tell me
it's feasible that a doctor

1055
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,080
wouldn't have time for all
this social media bullshit.

1056
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,430
Yeah, if you're pulling
15-hour shifts, I guess.

1057
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,635
Great.

1058
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,000
But he'd be on
Doximity probably.

1059
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,913
The Medical version
of LinkedIn.

1060
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,936
Could you not have just
stopped when I said "great"?

1061
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,359
Good morning.

1062
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Light reading?

1063
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,670
Do you even know
what pulmonology is?

1064
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,915
Yes, I do.

1065
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,919
It's the study of pulmon.

1066
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,656
Lungs are asymmetrical.
Right has three lobes, left two.

1067
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
You know why?

1068
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,976
Your heart needs
the real estate?

1069
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,069
Bravo.

1070
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,673
All right, everybody,
listen up!

1071
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,320
Not a problem for you,
I should imagine.

1072
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,678
What have they got? Come on!
Arguments and rebuttals.

1073
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,159
Let's have it, wake up!

1074
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,198
It's the first step toward a
national register of firearms.

1075
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,635
Scare mongering.

1076
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,976
No one's even come close
to proposing that.

1077
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,479
And if they did,

1078
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,391
it would have its own day
in Congress. Next.

1079
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,435
And it's two steps away
from confiscation.

1080
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,736
The gun lobby's rhetoric
is based on the falsehood

1081
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,752
that we want to take something
away from people. We don't.

1082
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,159
We want to make it
more difficult

1083
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,073
for dangerous people
to buy firearms.

1084
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,513
If we can't burst
this fallacy,

1085
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,999
we may as well go home.

1086
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,736
Esme, get me a bio
on Wendy Furniss, please?

1087
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,194
- Sure.
- Harwood Norton's CEO?

1088
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,016
Mmm-hmm. Second largest
employer in Virginia.

1089
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,314
Both senators are teetering,

1090
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,120
but if I can get her
to reach out to them...

1091
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
You don't see the irony

1092
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,112
in asking the CEO
of a defense contractor

1093
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,400
to advocate for a ban on guns?

1094
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,896
We're not banning anything!

1095
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,016
Jesus, you sound like
one of them.

1096
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,155
I'm in character.

1097
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,355
Next!

1098
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,640
Uh, the new rules
will increase

1099
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,194
wait times by two weeks.

1100
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,520
Welcome to America,

1101
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,376
where you'll wait
six months for an X-ray,

1102
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,072
but, hey, you can buy an AR-15

1103
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,872
in five minutes flat.

1104
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,120
You going to be
that flippant in public?

1105
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,856
Pussyfooting isn't memorable.
Sound bites are.

1106
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,110
And the appropriate one
goes like this,

1107
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,192
anyone that desperate
to get their hands on a gun

1108
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,669
shouldn't be allowed
anywhere near one.

1109
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,354
The total number of
MRI machines in Wisconsin...

1110
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,680
If the good Senator
ever finishes this speech,

1111
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,994
he will open it to the floor.

1112
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,360
You'll be question number three.

1113
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,278
You think he'll go for it?

1114
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,680
He knows the media is here,

1115
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,751
won't risk being heckled
at his own fundraiser.

1116
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,115
Back him into a corner,
and he'll have no choice.

1117
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,031
...of an additional $2 million

1118
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,793
for the purchase of
four brand-new machines

1119
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,394
within the first year
of my next term.

1120
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,232
Thank you.

1121
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,357
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1122
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,193
All right,
a few more questions

1123
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,759
for the Senator,
then we'll wrap up.

1124
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,394
Uh, yes, the lady in white.

1125
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,677
Mr. Senator, I'm Chair of
the Westfield Center...

1126
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,715
He was supposed to go to me third,
what's he doing?

1127
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,718
Followi ng orders.

1128
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,112
Three tables behind you,
two to the right.

1129
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,518
They've been tracking us
through Wisconsin.

1130
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,456
They would have had everyone
on that list vetted.

1131
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,913
You're blown.

1132
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,274
What do you mean?

1133
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,954
I mean that it's time
for plan B.

1134
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,191
And our final question
goes to Dr. Raj Amarasekara.

1135
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,960
I hope
I'm pronouncing that right.

1136
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,917
Of the Pulmonary
Associates of America.

1137
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,274
Thank you.

1138
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,176
Raj Amarasekara
is a working actor

1139
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,599
named Matthew Kantaria.

1140
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,557
They think he's about to
ask a benign question

1141
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,840
about the
clean air initiative.

1142
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,152
...it's a safe bet we'll see
three or four gunshot victims.

1143
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,400
Some are kids, teenagers.

1144
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,040
How do you intend to vote
on the Heaton-Harris Bill

1145
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,236
when it's put before Congress?

1146
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,358
Well...

1147
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,079
As you have experienced, uh,

1148
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,310
gun violence
is a real problem...

1149
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:40,959
You decoyed me?

1150
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,270
Raj Amarasekara has
personally plagiarized

1151
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,557
seven research papers,
all available online.

1152
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,993
He even has
a Doximity account.

1153
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,548
...financial burden
is the fact that

1154
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,200
some of the victims
are the, um...

1155
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,715
Kids.

1156
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,754
The young.

1157
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,513
So, I think it's,
uh, first and foremost,

1158
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,390
to put our sympathies with
the families of these victims.

1159
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,590
But it's true, gun violence
puts an enormous strain

1160
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,150
on our healthcare system
and its work force.

1161
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,757
Absolutely, yes.

1162
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,877
That's why I intend to give
my whole-hearted support

1163
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,753
to the Heaton-Harris Bill.

1164
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,719
And that's a wrap.

1165
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,637
Thank you.
Absolutely, thank you.

1166
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,440
Who else does he bring?

1167
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,518
Fascitelli and Garcia.

1168
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,239
Hey, Esme, I have a surprise
for you on Wednesday.

1169
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,198
We're going to
a new restaurant?

1170
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,715
How about a Second Amendment
debate at NYU Law School?

1171
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,553
Don't shout this
from the rooftops,

1172
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,216
but I trust you
to do a better job

1173
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,468
than anyone else on the team.

1174
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,913
You can't make it?

1175
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,309
I'm including myself
as part of the team.

1176
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,873
I wasn't cool enough to relate

1177
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,560
to college kids
when I was a college kid.

1178
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,588
I'll forward you the details.

1179
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,235
You again.

1180
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,673
I called them and I
specifically asked for Mark.

1181
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,080
And I specifically told you
he skipped town.

1182
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,472
Well, what agency
did he move to?

1183
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,319
How should I know?

1184
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,200
I ain't his parole officer.

1185
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,555
He's in trouble?

1186
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,709
I was kidding.

1187
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,392
Aww, we had so much fun
the other night.

1188
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,672
Well, you know
where the door is, lady.

1189
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,875
Go run to your Mark.

1190
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,553
I've got work to do tonight.

1191
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,159
Big case?

1192
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,197
Forde, human interaction
is an exchange.

1193
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,953
My money for your...

1194
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,160
Dick?

1195
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,032
I was gonna say "skill set."

1196
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,989
But that's the only exchange
I'm willing to make.

1197
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,118
Now you sound like a banker.

1198
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,759
I got to do prep anyways.

1199
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,909
For what?

1200
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,675
Another client,
tomorrow night.

1201
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,913
You do prep?

1202
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,200
For functions.

1203
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,154
Believe it or not,

1204
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,150
not everyone hires me
for my skill set.

1205
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,840
Half my clients just
want me on their arm.

1206
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,336
Some just want
someone to talk to

1207
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,456
from a different neck
of the woods,

1208
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,835
- who ain't gonna judge them.
- That is so pathetic.

1209
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,035
Functions are different.

1210
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,717
The agency gave me
a list of covers.

1211
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,719
Insurance exec, marketing guy.

1212
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,280
Tomorrow is oil and gas.

1213
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,075
I'll be seeing you.

1214
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,517
I think you owe me
something more.

1215
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,874
No, it's all there. Count it.

1216
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,713
This covers my services.

1217
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,696
But I just gave you
a whole lot of information

1218
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
about my line of work.

1219
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,336
On your principles
of exchange...

1220
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,360
Oh, my God!

1221
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,556
Okay, that was a voluntary
donation on your part.

1222
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,553
I pay you so I can
imagine a life I chose

1223
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,471
to forego in the pursuit
of my career.

1224
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,056
So, why don't you
go out and get it?

1225
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,160
It's not for me.

1226
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,416
Not when I was
in my early 20s,

1227
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,509
and sure as hell not now.

1228
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,354
So, "no house you call home,

1229
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,520
"no folks you call family,"

1230
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,914
- sort of thing, huh?
- Uh-uh.

1231
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,036
- You ever regret that?
- Not for a second.

1232
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,240
At least now
we're peeling a layer.

1233
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,273
And that is all my principles
of exchange will allow.

1234
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,598
Goodbye, Forde.

1235
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,616
If you're a terrorist,

1236
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,710
or someone who shouldn't
be allowed on that plane,

1237
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,376
which lane are you
going to walk through?

1238
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,549
Yeah, well, obviously...

1239
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,959
Thursday morning.

1240
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
Okay, I'll hold.

1241
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,874
- Lauren! Boston, Thursday!
- Got it!

1242
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,753
I deleted every vestige
of my online existence.

1243
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,955
You didn't replace it,

1244
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,256
leaving a Clara-sized
hole in Google,

1245
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,998
which they flagged
in due diligence.

1246
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,399
I did replace it.

1247
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,794
Esme!

1248
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,028
Clara Thomson just returned
from a 2-year stint

1249
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,190
with Médecins Sans Frontières.
It was solid.

1250
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,277
Why didn't you tell me
about Raj...

1251
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,679
Just call him Matthew.

1252
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,193
I checked with Finance.

1253
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,456
Your actor wasn't
paid from our account.

1254
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,152
You ran him out
of your own pocket.

1255
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,400
It's good practice
to keep your circle small.

1256
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,136
In this town,
no matter where you are,

1257
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,040
you're never more than
two feet away from a rat.

1258
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,430
Hey! I want you on the podium
at the ARS dinner.

1259
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,599
Wait, that's a huge deal.

1260
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,736
You don't think
we should share

1261
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,856
the public speaking a little?

1262
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,560
And blow all the goodwill
you've racked up?

1263
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,949
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
in the spotlight.

1264
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,040
Doing all the press.

1265
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,600
Get comfortable,
that ship has sailed.

1266
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,991
Hey, yes. Thursday morning,
I'll be there.

1267
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,056
Every day,
48 children or teens are shot.

1268
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,593
That's not across
the world, folks,

1269
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,079
that's right here in America.

1270
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,496
We are joined right now
by a representative

1271
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,635
from the Brady Campaign,

1272
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,350
- Esme Manchurian.
- It's Manucharian.

1273
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,598
Knocking on doors,
making house calls?

1274
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,736
How long did it take you
to even get to this place?

1275
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,120
Consider it a sign
of how important

1276
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,759
it is that we get you
on board.

1277
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,040
Why?

1278
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,758
In your long and
distinguished career,

1279
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,910
you've done precisely
jack-shit for feminism.

1280
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,799
Because gender
doesn't interest me.

1281
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,196
The only thing
you're missing is a dick.

1282
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,032
I think
your presence in the room

1283
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,951
would be a great help

1284
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,270
as I make our case
to Senator Hofland.

1285
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,640
God willing,
we can help protect

1286
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,553
our neighbors from the kind of tragedy
America has endured...

1287
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,394
Esme... Manchurian.

1288
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,868
Manucharian.

1289
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,714
In this country,
nine women are shot

1290
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,576
and killed by their intimate
partners every week.

1291
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,398
The risk of homicide
goes up 500%...

1292
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,710
Don't hurl stats at me,
I'm not a fucking journalist.

1293
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,479
You think
I don't know all this?

1294
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,595
Does your membership?

1295
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,636
Because now would be
a great time to tell them.

1296
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,152
Larsson and Parr
have donated

1297
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,576
millions of
their personal fortunes.

1298
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,511
- Yeah.
- I can't go hat-in-hand for more.

1299
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,355
Hey, Manchurian!

1300
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,829
Mandel's on the brink,
I need conversational topics.

1301
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,638
- What do you mean?
- Small talk.

1302
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,950
Idle nonsense of no import
to anything.

1303
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,951
You outsource
your social interactions?

1304
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,315
Yeah. Interests,
hobbies... Kids!

1305
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,776
There's no better way
to butter up a parent

1306
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,280
than to tell him
how hot his kids are.

1307
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,355
On it.

1308
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,960
The last time we met,
your youngest was

1309
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,956
knocking on the door
of the Ivy League.

1310
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,268
- Yes.
- Logan, was it?

1311
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,240
Christ! I can't even remember
that conversation.

1312
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,136
Mandy Hamlyn from the American
Nurses Association

1313
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
- on line three!
- Ah!

1314
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,656
I think there are
a great many on the Hill

1315
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,696
who have become so accustomed
to your generous support,

1316
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,720
it wouldn't hurt to give them
a short, sharp shock.

1317
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,914
Your donors, don't ask
for more. Ask for less.

1318
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,616
If you feel strongly
about Heaton-Harris,

1319
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,834
you could do worse

1320
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,496
than to pledge to cut ties
to any senator

1321
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,720
who doesn't come out in favor.

1322
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,756
So, what, we're
turning the screw,

1323
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,637
and saving money
at the same time?

1324
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,656
I don't want to
live in a society where there

1325
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,511
is a new school shooting
every week!

1326
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,438
That is why when put to vote,

1327
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,909
I will be supporting
the Heaton-Harris Bill!

1328
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,395
It came in anonymously,

1329
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,736
but everyone's
thinking Bloomberg.

1330
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,558
Five hundred grand?
That's over 12% of our budget!

1331
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,736
If you were donating
that much,

1332
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,896
why would you do it
anonymously?

1333
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,955
Obvious reason.

1334
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,395
- What? Privacy?
- No.

1335
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,630
It makes you look noble
when you leak your identity.

1336
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,075
Oh, my God.
Were you born that cynical?

1337
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,116
That is just a word to
denote the absence...

1338
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,352
Of the naivety I so keenly
exhibit? Yeah, right.

1339
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,713
Back on in three, people.

1340
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,472
Since when
were you camera-shy?

1341
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,031
What happened?
You find a wrinkle?

1342
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,475
If it isn't
Bill Sandford's poodle.

1343
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,478
Let me guess,
on a tight leash,

1344
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,278
sniffing at his ass
for business?

1345
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,068
If you weren't such a joke,

1346
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,388
we'd already have
his business.

1347
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,598
So how about this?

1348
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,033
Give Mini-Me a day off,

1349
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,390
and I'll give you
a shot at the title.

1350
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,869
Live TV debate, you and me.

1351
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,195
You must be desperate

1352
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,416
if you're willing
to give me airtime.

1353
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,720
I kick your bony ass
hard enough,

1354
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,113
Bill Sandford will realize

1355
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,640
why he came to us
in the first place.

1356
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,871
Uh-uh. You need me strong
to make him worried.

1357
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,674
You're not looking so strong
after a head-on with me.

1358
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,350
All right. I'll grant you
a job interview

1359
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,793
on national television.

1360
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,474
You can show your master
what a big, tough dog you are.

1361
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,416
What we're about to discuss

1362
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,919
should only be
referred to in code

1363
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,558
in the office and over e-mail.

1364
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,911
My ex-employers aren't
beyond bugging and hacking.

1365
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,200
You think our conference room
is wearing a wire?

1366
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,880
We're gonna target
a senator from a state

1367
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,712
we have zero right to swing.

1368
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,280
Oh, please, God, don't say...

1369
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,476
Alberto Gomez,
Republican, Florida.

1370
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,109
What?

1371
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,576
I thought you were
gonna say Missouri.

1372
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,635
Florida's preposterous.

1373
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,029
I'm being optimistic.

1374
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,776
Public opinion runs against
Heaton-Harris in Florida.

1375
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,711
- Let's talk later.
- In the office?

1376
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:24,074
How do I register my dissent?
By semaphore?

1377
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,456
Alex, you're in charge
of ad banners,

1378
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,959
you have a 2:00 at JWT.

1379
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,758
I want two phone pitches.

1380
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,239
Clara, Brian, Lauren,
you're one.

1381
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,669
Cynthia, Esme, Franklin,
you're two.

1382
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,399
Ross, get stats to both.
Come on, get to it.

1383
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,758
What the hell
are you thinking?

1384
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,273
That you should
let me do my job.

1385
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,713
This ain't Cole Kravitz,
damn it.

1386
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,112
Our client's a non-profit,

1387
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,997
not some cashed-up
conglomerate.

1388
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,835
I'm hiding in the bushes
with my begging bowl,

1389
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,776
waiting to leap out at anyone
who looks like money,

1390
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,136
and you're getting ready
to set fire

1391
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,390
to half a million dollars
on some hare-brained...

1392
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,155
I mean this James Bond
shit's endearingly wacky,

1393
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,336
but if you think you're
seriously going to get

1394
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,191
any traction out of Florida,
you're way out.

1395
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,113
Rodolfo, it was explicit
in your pitch to lure me here

1396
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,656
that you held
a certain degree of trust

1397
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,272
in my ability
to run this campaign.

1398
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,799
George, it's me.

1399
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,154
I know what I'm doing.

1400
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,271
We need to talk about Florida.

1401
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,078
And I don't do hare-brained.

1402
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,193
Fucking A right.

1403
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,835
From the way you been
kicking my ass all morning,

1404
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,069
I'm starting to think

1405
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,310
you invited yourself here
just to kick my ass.

1406
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,995
I'm personally in favor
of Heaton-Harris.

1407
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,233
I've publicly declared,
my voters are behind me.

1408
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,956
Did you want to meet
just to kick my ass?

1409
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,756
Look,
you're sitting on six votes.

1410
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,594
Sandford's not a punk,

1411
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,716
he knows the opposition's
counting on them.

1412
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,198
He also knows
if they don't get them,

1413
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,793
their campaign will be over.

1414
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,673
So, what are you gonna do?

1415
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,115
Walk into my club,

1416
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,480
bend me over
a green baize table,

1417
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,551
and give me the spiel
about freedom?

1418
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,016
About how,
if the liberals get their way,

1419
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,200
in a couple of hundred years,

1420
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,832
the Second Amendment
will enshrine

1421
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,478
our rights to bear
baseball bats?

1422
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,678
No, that's the argument
you're gonna make

1423
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,398
to your friends
in the Blue Dog Coalition

1424
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,400
when you tell them
you're changing your position.

1425
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,750
Bill Sandford's thinking about
backing a new candidate.

1426
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,194
One of their own.
A real up-and-comer. Hispanic.

1427
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,393
Got offers from
eight Ivy League schools.

1428
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,068
Ivy League schools?

1429
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:43,432
Have you seen
my approval ratings, Pat?

1430
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,238
No, he's not running
against you.

1431
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,920
He's running against your son.

1432
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,071
The gun lobby wants
your support, Hank.

1433
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,416
They know your boy's
running for Michigan.

1434
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,839
They'll handpick an opponent.

1435
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,913
Back him to the hilt.

1436
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,712
I tried to talk Sandford
out of it, but...

1437
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,976
Bullshit, Connors,
you probably

1438
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,360
put him up to it,
you motherfucker.

1439
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,839
About those approval ratings.

1440
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,591
You can go either way.

1441
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,116
Quietly recant,
protect your son.

1442
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,633
Sandford won't forget it.

1443
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,633
You disappoint him...

1444
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,753
He won't forget that, either.

1445
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,759
So, how was Pittsburgh?

1446
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,033
What are you, a Fed?

1447
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,268
The President of the Mid-Atlantic
Association of Women

1448
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,715
in Law Enforcement called
to say thanks for lunch.

1449
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,920
I wasn't aware they were
part of our plan.

1450
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,915
It wasn't expensed.

1451
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,274
It was a 30-minute lunch.

1452
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,713
They're not
a part of our plan,

1453
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,995
which is why
it wasn't expensed.

1454
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:57,678
Am I not allowed
a social life?

1455
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,949
I didn't know you had one.

1456
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,799
As someone who has
her underlings

1457
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,313
root for
conversational topics.

1458
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,391
I maintain
a small circle of allies.

1459
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,198
Uh-huh. Cops and nurses?

1460
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,717
Well, I can provide a list if
you require full disclosure.

1461
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,597
So, grand unveiling.

1462
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,438
- You coming?
- We got a bigger problem.

1463
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,456
While you've been jetting
around the country for lunch,

1464
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,040
our opponents have been
doing their job.

1465
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,356
Hank Badgley,
Chairman of the Blue Dog,

1466
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,879
who controls the votes of...

1467
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,309
Six Senators, I know who
he is. He's in our pocket.

1468
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,992
Really? That what you think?

1469
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,679
He was on board,
but he just did a 180.

1470
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,118
Says he wants to wait and see.

1471
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,672
"Wait and see"
is more like a 90.

1472
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,911
We're chasing Senators
who are in play.

1473
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,195
We can't afford to lose
seven votes we had locked.

1474
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,588
We won't recover.

1475
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,757
We have him on camera
pledging support?

1476
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
Absolutely.

1477
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,078
Then we'll have to
make him feel it.

1478
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,079
Thank you.

1479
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,592
Alex, these banners are good.

1480
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,754
Could you say that again

1481
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,200
and sound a little
less surprised?

1482
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,392
Hold on, this can't be right.

1483
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,950
- Senator Gomez...
- We're not going to Florida.

1484
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,160
What?

1485
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,549
Florida's out.

1486
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,056
But you said that
we were going to Florida

1487
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,080
to swing Gomez...

1488
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,469
Everyone turn to Tab 9,
please.

1489
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,512
I don't have
anything at Tab 9.

1490
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,351
Security, lock down
Cynthia Green's desk.

1491
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,078
Secure her files
and her hard drives,

1492
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,400
and escort her
off the premises.

1493
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,909
Your Blackberry, now.

1494
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,639
Now!

1495
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,955
Let's go.

1496
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,759
He offered me
partnership track.

1497
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,399
Good luck with that.

1498
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,273
Clear the office.

1499
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,960
Come on, come on, come on!
Everybody out.

1500
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,640
I'll have the place
swept for taps.

1501
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,638
Sounds like James Bond
shit to me.

1502
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,473
We will talk about this later.

1503
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,917
Come on, everybody,
clear the building!

1504
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,951
Let's go! Out! Come on!

1505
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
I can't believe the whole

1506
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,317
Gomez-Florida thing
was a ruse.

1507
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,357
We're coming out of
left field to take Colorado

1508
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,074
before they figure out which
hole they got screwed in.

1509
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,479
How could she do that?

1510
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,912
How does someone
even think like that?

1511
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,274
Maybe in her naivety,

1512
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,920
she figured it'd be good
for her career.

1513
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,628
I wasn't talking
about Cynthia.

1514
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,749
Morning.

1515
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,634
Please take a seat.

1516
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,358
We're not saying
it can't be done.

1517
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,920
But it's risky.

1518
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,116
- We only get one shot.
- Hey!

1519
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,555
Were you followed?

1520
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,715
Evidently.

1521
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,988
Let him in.

1522
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,416
Do you solemnly swear

1523
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:35,496
that you will tell the truth,

1524
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,317
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

1525
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,072
upon pains and penalties
of perjury?

1526
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,673
I do.

1527
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,438
State your full name, please.

1528
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,233
Well, look at this.

1529
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,757
Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt.

1530
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,712
I'm guessing this gear
ain't for tuning my '69 Chevy?

1531
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,715
Rodolfo,
my unofficial support team.

1532
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,109
Big Sam.

1533
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,628
Little Sam.

1534
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,753
During the time that you
worked alongside Miss Sloane,

1535
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,917
did you hold any discussions

1536
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,040
pertaining to the use

1537
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,917
of illegal
surveillance techniques?

1538
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,856
So, how big
is your organization?

1539
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,519
Well, there are six of us,
four are out on assignment.

1540
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,957
- And you're ex...
- NSA.

1541
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,354
Badgley is flip-flopping.

1542
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,998
But, quickest way
to get him in line

1543
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,354
is to mine for sordid details,

1544
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,376
and then let him know
we're in possession of them.

1545
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,551
Mr. Schmidt,
did you?

1546
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,638
Yes, Senator, we did.

1547
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,796
And what means did they have
at their disposal

1548
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,388
to carry out these
surveillance practices?

1549
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,948
Standard 24-hour
video and audio surveillance,

1550
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,638
cell phone and online
account hacking,

1551
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:49,073
location tracking,
and, with our latest tech,

1552
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,871
close-quarters audio,
anytime, anyplace.

1553
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,920
You ever hear the expression
"Fly on the wall"?

1554
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,396
Well, meet the cutting edge
in eavesdropping.

1555
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:01,989
It's a cockroach.

1556
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,872
Which can be retro-fitted

1557
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,509
as a cybernetic
robo-roach with this.

1558
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:11,395
We glue electrodes
to its antennae,

1559
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:12,754
perforate the thorax,

1560
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,871
and we can control
its movement remotely.

1561
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,632
Don't call PETA, Schmidt.

1562
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,233
These guys can
crawl under doors,

1563
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,709
into crevices, bags,
completely undetected.

1564
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,635
They can go weeks without food
and still be mobile.

1565
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,829
And how did you react to
the possibility of all this?

1566
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,872
I told her it was
mind-boggling, ingenious,

1567
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,269
morally repugnant
and completely unacceptable.

1568
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,034
Boo!

1569
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,792
You're talking
about blackmailing

1570
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,518
a United States Senator.

1571
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,189
Have you any idea of the
damage if this ever came out?

1572
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,601
No more than the damage done
if we don't get Badgley back.

1573
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,232
Without prejudice
to the undoubtedly

1574
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,753
stellar job that you guys do.

1575
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,233
Our firm has certain standards

1576
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,072
below which I'm not
prepared to stoop.

1577
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,195
Let me out of here.

1578
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,229
Schmidt.

1579
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,514
Find another way.

1580
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,736
It was a rude awakening

1581
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,360
for Michigan Senator,
Hank Badgley, today

1582
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,709
as he was tailed from his home
to his workplace by this...

1583
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,559
What the fuck is that?

1584
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,432
...organized by gun safety
campaigners

1585
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,800
in response
to what they perceive

1586
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,040
as a U-turn on his support...

1587
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,550
Can you believe...
I do not fucking believe!

1588
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,037
...in the shadow
of a giant rat.

1589
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,239
It's on all of
the national news outlets.

1590
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,510
How the hell
did she manage that?

1591
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,160
She didn't. They swing
left all on their own.

1592
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,753
It has its own Twitter feed.

1593
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,200
Huh?

1594
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,839
The rat.

1595
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,799
Really, I think that
this whole rat business

1596
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,633
is little more than an
unfortunate misunderstanding.

1597
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,076
I was one of the first
members of the senate

1598
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,395
to lend my support
to Heaton-Harris.

1599
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,799
I've always maintained that

1600
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,438
the Bill is integral
to public safety,

1601
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,074
and my support for it
is unwavering.

1602
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,117
Now, I sincerely hope that

1603
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,878
we can get past
all this silliness...

1604
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:06,296
Th ree more
Blue Dog Senators

1605
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,470
have press conferences
scheduled for next week.

1606
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,856
Keep hammering the point

1607
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,871
that we're not arguing
for confiscation.

1608
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,353
Heaton-Harris
is about stopping...

1609
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,839
Criminals and psychopaths.

1610
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,359
Yeah, I'm a pro
at this now, Liz.

1611
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,237
I'll see you in there.

1612
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,150
So you knew there was
a leak from when?

1613
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,434
- Sorry?
- Cynthia.

1614
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,835
When did you start to
suspect there was a leak?

1615
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,717
Uh, after the UAPD fundraiser.

1616
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,552
And you had her
followed by a PI?

1617
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,278
How did you know it was her?

1618
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,719
Sorry?

1619
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,836
The leak, you had
Cynthia watched.

1620
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,599
How did you know it was her?

1621
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,838
I didn't.

1622
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,753
You had us all watched?

1623
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,079
Howdy.

1624
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,435
Cal Sneider,
banking and actuarial.

1625
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,096
I'm sure we've
been introduced,

1626
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,120
but your name escapes me.

1627
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,760
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong person.

1628
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,149
I'm pretty sure I don't.

1629
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,793
Have a good memory for faces.

1630
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,640
This one I wouldn't
readily forget.

1631
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,112
Really, Mr. Sneider,

1632
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,317
I've no idea
who you think I am.

1633
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,839
Excuse me.

1634
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,038
Uh-huh. You know
we're not really

1635
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,616
supposed to be having
this conversation, right?

1636
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,616
Half of Oregon
is protected Federal parkland.

1637
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,039
They can't develop it.

1638
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,856
So, state budgets
come from logging revenues.

1639
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,920
- I got it...
- Liz?

1640
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,080
Whatever clearing your head
looks like, this isn't it.

1641
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,277
So, loggers are
a very influential group.

1642
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,635
Excuse me!

1643
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,520
Can someone have her
makeup done, too, please?

1644
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,629
I'm not a part of this!

1645
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,256
You're a public figure
in a room full of cameras.

1646
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,395
Is that her?

1647
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,280
Liz?

1648
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,950
Hey, we have to get
Bryan on these loggers.

1649
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,256
We're on top of
the goddamn loggers!

1650
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,280
Just clear your head!

1651
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,320
One moment.

1652
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:42,993
Clear your head,
like I told you.

1653
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,389
Hello?

1654
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,389
- Fine.
- Ms. Sloane, welcome.

1655
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,230
Pat. Please, take a seat.

1656
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,114
I know Friday's Filing Day

1657
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,336
and your campaign
will be over,

1658
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,496
but if you're thinking
I'm gonna go easy,

1659
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,520
I can't do that.

1660
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,593
This is live TV,
so no colorful language.

1661
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,511
Bullshit
job offers to my staff,

1662
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,079
you've plumbed new depths.

1663
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,798
A giant inflatable rodent?
Please.

1664
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,080
You ruined that girl's career.

1665
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,510
All right, shut up,
the both of you. Let's go!

1666
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,836
Hello, America,
I'm Jon O'Neill,

1667
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,872
welcome to a special edition
ofThis Week In Washington.

1668
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,828
Guns! More or Less?

1669
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,798
There were 372
mass shootings last year,

1670
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,393
64 school shootings,

1671
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,398
and there are over 300
million guns in our country...

1672
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,160
You used to
work with Connors?

1673
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,434
Four years.

1674
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,270
Foul-mouthed, unexpected,
and very effective.

1675
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,994
If background checks
are to be of any use,

1676
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:45,753
they should apply to
all gun sales, not just some.

1677
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,075
Isn't that what Heaton-Harris
is proposing?

1678
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,835
Precisely. The bill expands
the scope of gun regulation,

1679
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,239
and it's yet another affront

1680
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,072
to Americans'
Constitutional rights.

1681
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,549
No, the bill closes
an absurd loophole

1682
01:11:57,640 --> 01:12:00,029
which allows people
on terrorist watch-lists

1683
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,315
to buy guns without
any checks whatsoever.

1684
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,356
It's an incursion
into individual liberty

1685
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,998
by an all-powerful
government...

1686
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,548
- What, like drivers' licenses?
- Drivers' licenses?

1687
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,273
It's illegal to operate a car

1688
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,456
without going through rigorous

1689
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,118
theoretical and practical
assessments.

1690
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,470
- That's a clear constraint...
- Fugu chefs.

1691
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,480
...on the freedom of
individuals to drive cars,

1692
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,034
- or pilots to fly planes.
- Come on. Fugu chefs.

1693
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,918
You know, in Japan,
chefs train for seven years

1694
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,274
before they're
allowed to serve

1695
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,720
a poisonous blowfish
called fugu.

1696
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,795
Yes!

1697
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:27,976
What does any of this

1698
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,320
have to do with
background checks?

1699
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,919
Is a fair question.

1700
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,194
Does anyone in this room

1701
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,400
think the government should
abolish drivers' licenses?

1702
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,954
- That's absurd.
- Why?

1703
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,280
They're a government incursion
into individual liberty.

1704
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,796
We accept them because
they make sense.

1705
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,518
The more dangerous
the machinery,

1706
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,318
the more rigorous
the tests should be.

1707
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,192
I think we can
extend our definition

1708
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,999
of dangerous machinery
to semi-automatic firearms.

1709
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,016
Except that the Second
Amendment to the Constitution

1710
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,429
doesn't guarantee
the right to drive cars,

1711
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,115
or operate machinery or serve
blowfish for that matter.

1712
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,272
It guarantees the right
to keep and bear arms.

1713
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,438
Perhaps you haven't
read it lately.

1714
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,953
Nothing in the bill

1715
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,918
infringes the rights of the
people to keep and bear arms.

1716
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,496
The Second Amendment
was signed in a time

1717
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,397
where the average
life expectancy was 38,

1718
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,040
and it was common practice
for our Founding Fathers

1719
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,590
to resolve their differences
at dawn in a gunfight.

1720
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,638
What may have been perfectly
sensible in those alien times

1721
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,296
is wholly inadequate to solve
the problems of the present.

1722
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,197
That's not the rebuttal,
what's she doing?

1723
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,696
The United States
Constitution

1724
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:27,278
has stood the test of time.

1725
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,035
It's authored to confer
unimpeachable rights,

1726
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,354
which don't change depending

1727
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,432
on which way
the wind's blowing.

1728
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,398
It's so authored
with the specific intent

1729
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,674
of keeping at bay

1730
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,478
the Elizabeth Sloanes
of this world,

1731
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,496
who wanna wipe their asses
with the Constitution...

1732
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,669
Okay, let's...

1733
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,400
...and replace it
with their own judgment,

1734
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,873
because she knows better than

1735
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,672
the Founding Fathers
of this great nation.

1736
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,788
Nothing is unimpeachable,
not even the Constitution.

1737
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,075
It's ironic that the very
statement of rights

1738
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,679
you're so quick to invoke

1739
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,671
is in fact an Amendment.

1740
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,640
I may not
like it either, Elizabeth,

1741
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,679
but it's the Second Amendment.

1742
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,196
Comes right after freedom of
speech, religion, and press,

1743
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,157
and somewhere before
freedom from search

1744
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,240
and from having to testify
against yourself.

1745
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,880
They're all sort of
bunched together.

1746
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,400
It's called
the Bill of Rights.

1747
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,720
- How do you get around that?
- We don't need to.

1748
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,473
Supreme Court
already made it clear

1749
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,118
that the right to own a gun

1750
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,838
is subject to
lawful restriction.

1751
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,478
One of those
is background checks.

1752
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,717
Universal background checks
are an infringement.

1753
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,277
What part of
"shall not be infringed"

1754
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,594
don't you get?

1755
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,632
I get that that's the weakest,
most mind-numbing retort

1756
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,717
in your impoverished arsenal.

1757
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:35,393
Sort of a last refuge
for those

1758
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:36,640
with no real argument at all.

1759
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,789
You're talking about

1760
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,080
the United States
Constitution.

1761
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,675
If they could produce
a rational winning argument,

1762
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,796
I'd gladly migrate
to their side,

1763
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,758
but "because it says so
in the Constitution,

1764
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,953
"the Bible, or my horoscope,"
it's not a winning argument!

1765
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,115
It's a ripcord.

1766
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,435
An intellectual equivalent
of a yellow,

1767
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,472
pant-pissing wimp
cowering behind mommy's skirt.

1768
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,074
- Why don't we bring this back.
- No, no, no. Let's not!

1769
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,037
Why don't we ask
all the mothers out there

1770
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,839
who lost their children
to an armed sociopath,

1771
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,229
if they believe
in his unimpeachable

1772
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,675
Constitutional right
to bear arms?

1773
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,398
Why not ask the terrified girl

1774
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:13,516
who locked herself
in a janitor's closet

1775
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,794
at Bloomington High,

1776
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,069
forced to listen

1777
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,355
as her peers were
being massacred?

1778
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,598
Go ahead, ask her!

1779
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,955
Her name is Esme Manucharian.

1780
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,520
She's standing right there!

1781
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,032
Jesus Christ, Liz.

1782
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:36,553
Okay, time out!

1783
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,640
We're going to take a break,
and when we come back,

1784
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,158
maybe these two
will stop playing

1785
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,874
Patty Cake and
the gloves'll really come off.

1786
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,552
Be right back!

1787
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,752
I won't insult
your intelligence

1788
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,880
by claiming that came out
in the heat of the moment.

1789
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,193
How far back?

1790
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,390
Once I started getting
used to all the media?

1791
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,635
Okay. Day one.

1792
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,595
Wow.

1793
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,638
At dinner that night...

1794
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,638
You asked me if I'd go public

1795
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,188
if it was the difference
between victory and defeat.

1796
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,239
What if I'd said no?

1797
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,633
Would you still have done it?

1798
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,873
Probably.

1799
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,473
I was hired to win,

1800
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,393
and I have a responsibility

1801
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,158
to use whatever
resource I have.

1802
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,480
The press we're going to
get from this,

1803
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,496
it's practically a dereliction
of duty not to use it.

1804
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,272
That's it? I'm a "resource"?

1805
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,713
Professionally, yes.

1806
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:15,158
I understand you have
feelings, and a life,

1807
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,878
but I have no duty to them.

1808
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,509
I have a duty to the cause,
and if the two conflict,

1809
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,034
there will only
ever be one winner.

1810
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,072
Well, hooray for
straight talk.

1811
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,593
Okay.

1812
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:34,792
Get ready, Esme.
Network wants a statement.

1813
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,071
Re-apply your makeup.
We'll walk out arm-in-arm.

1814
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,991
We'll be brief. No questions.

1815
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,638
Tonight, we'll leave them
wanting more.

1816
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,753
First of all,

1817
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,920
I want to make it clear
that I have dedicated my life

1818
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,748
to gun safety issues because
the current system is broken.

1819
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,513
That's a rational judgment.

1820
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,239
Not an emotional one.

1821
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,319
I am a survivor

1822
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:10,432
of the Bloomington High School
massacre of 1998.

1823
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,237
For years, I sought to hide
the pain and the trauma,

1824
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,594
for fear of having to
relive it.

1825
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,273
But I've come to realize

1826
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,431
that the thousands of people
affected by gun violence

1827
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,954
need to stand up
and be counted.

1828
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,953
They need a representative

1829
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,995
who can speak out
for what they have endured.

1830
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,868
Let's call Sandford.

1831
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,816
Someone who can relate
their experience...

1832
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,159
There might be
life in this yet.

1833
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,554
...to the public at large.

1834
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,798
You're a piece of work,
Elizabeth.

1835
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,398
If you want to
set yourself on fire

1836
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,515
to service your need to win,
I won't protest, but Esme?

1837
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,440
The end is my concern.

1838
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,954
You liberal goody-goodies
can fret over the means.

1839
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,513
- You need me.
- The end?

1840
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,074
It disappeared over the Hill

1841
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,176
when you cocked your leg
and pissed all over the flag!

1842
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,158
Comparing the United States
Constitution to a horoscope?

1843
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,270
That's the kind of shit
the gun lobby thrives on.

1844
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,336
Or have you realized by now
we're going to lose anyway?

1845
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,430
This is more important
than my career,

1846
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,351
or Esme's unease
at fighting reporters

1847
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,040
every time she has to
take out the trash.

1848
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:55,355
- You're out of control.
- We're not gonna lose.

1849
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,308
What if I told you

1850
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,392
this whole strategy
was a shell game?

1851
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:08,228
For the benefit of the
Cynthia Greens of this firm.

1852
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,148
What are you talking about?

1853
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,799
Bill Sandford was right.

1854
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,872
Women are the
gun lobby's blind spot.

1855
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,598
A massive power base
that they don't speak to

1856
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,673
and they can't control.

1857
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,560
And?

1858
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,271
Those strange excursions
on my itinerary?

1859
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:35,630
Women's representative bodies,
feminist groups,

1860
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,793
female CEOs.

1861
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:40,319
I've talked as many as I could

1862
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,118
into brow-beating
their membership

1863
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,514
to donate to my PAC.

1864
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,600
You have a PAC?

1865
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:48,078
Bill Sandford's getting
a nasty surprise

1866
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,589
come filing day.

1867
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,429
How nasty are we talking?

1868
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,718
Fifteen million from over
three million donors-nasty.

1869
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,588
In one quarter?

1870
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,997
Actually, less.

1871
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,677
Unbelievable.

1872
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,080
Why are you
telling me this now?

1873
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,696
You kept this
from me all along,

1874
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,920
and you're telling me tonight?

1875
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,837
Oh, my God, I tell you
we're back in the game,

1876
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,109
and all you can say is that?

1877
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,997
You knew you were
gonna screw Esme tonight,

1878
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:21,656
so you kept this from me
to blindside me

1879
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,000
before I had a chance
to fire you.

1880
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,115
You have unusual insight
for a "boutique" lobbyist.

1881
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,640
You've been pulling
all the strings, all along.

1882
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,719
Lobbying is about foresight.

1883
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,075
You anticipate your opponent's
moves, you devise...

1884
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,954
I am not your
fucking opponent!

1885
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,714
Were you ever normal?

1886
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,635
As a child?

1887
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,268
Or were the twisted
thought processes in your mind

1888
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,475
hard-wired in the womb?

1889
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,558
Because I'm having
a really hard time

1890
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,357
understanding how
somebody gets to this.

1891
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,833
Guess I'm just
a piece of work.

1892
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,399
I'll see you tomorrow.

1893
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,712
You're Madeline
Elizabeth Sloane.

1894
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,915
You work in government affairs
at a communications company.

1895
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,713
Well googled.

1896
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,876
So what was that?
At the fundraiser?

1897
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,240
You pretended
like we're strangers.

1898
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,919
What did you expect?

1899
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,034
You all right?

1900
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,600
Mmm...

1901
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,310
The only person to call me
Madeline was my mother.

1902
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,835
Government affairs
and communications

1903
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,757
are just fancy words
for lobbying.

1904
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,550
And lobbying's a fancy word
for what, exactly?

1905
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,272
Outside this room,
we're strangers.

1906
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,000
Those were the rules
of this engagement.

1907
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,109
We were alone...

1908
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:21,151
In a public place.

1909
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:23,392
I can't be associated
with you there.

1910
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,917
At least one other person
knew who you were.

1911
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,069
Who was she, anyway?

1912
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,518
I never reveal
my clients. Ever.

1913
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,750
You just, uh, pry into
their personal lives,

1914
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,074
google for the truth.

1915
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,376
Yeah, I hear you lobbyists
ain't so good with the truth.

1916
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,753
Says the guy
with four identities,

1917
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,280
who sleeps with
strangers for money?

1918
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:41,560
I'm just surprised by what
a natural bullshitter you are.

1919
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,511
I grew up lying, Forde.

1920
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,272
Didn't want to. I had to.

1921
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,279
That's why I excel at it.

1922
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,158
It's a skill I would've
happily traded

1923
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,280
for a normal life.

1924
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,079
Normal's overrated.

1925
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,480
I'm sorry.

1926
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,435
I'm sorry.

1927
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:44,679
But I can't.

1928
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:46,834
What's wrong?

1929
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,632
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about tonight.

1930
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,238
Why? I do somethin'?

1931
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,032
No, it's, um...

1932
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,511
I'm not in
the right frame of mind.

1933
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,514
Here.

1934
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,834
- Easiest money you ever made.
- I didn't do anything.

1935
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,592
Well, you showed up,
I wasted your time, so, yeah.

1936
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,880
You know, we could just
sit and talk, and...

1937
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,480
Take the fucking money,
Forde!

1938
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,194
Get out, please.

1939
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:32,079
Suit yourself.

1940
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,754
Neumark.

1941
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,758
- Milner.
- Two hands here, come on.

1942
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,950
- Carlson...
- Wade Powell, Virginia.

1943
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,080
Hackman's come over too.

1944
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,270
We've lost Milner, Neumark,
Carlson, Hackman.

1945
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,256
Adamou's chief of staff said
he's softening his position.

1946
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,952
- Alex?
- I'll soften his fuckin'...

1947
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,433
Bill Sandford's on line 3.

1948
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,993
Closing Adamou
right the fuck now.

1949
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,715
She takes my own idea

1950
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,000
and goes up
against us with it.

1951
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,520
We did try
to warn you, Bill.

1952
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,474
Fifteen million.
From three million donors.

1953
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,749
In less than a quarter.

1954
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,110
You stop her,
you stop Heaton-Harris.

1955
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,593
We have to
make it personal now.

1956
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,835
She becomes the story.

1957
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:22,116
We can use our
media relationships, Bill,

1958
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,429
put her on the defensive.

1959
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,198
I don't just want her
on the defensive.

1960
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,675
I don't just want her
off the campaign.

1961
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:30,793
I want her to be the reason
that people think twice

1962
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,480
before taking on the guardians
of the Second Amendment.

1963
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,071
I want her career.

1964
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,437
Hey, Alex, it's me.
I just landed.

1965
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,400
Philadelphia was as good as
what we could have hoped for.

1966
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,710
- So how are we doing?
- That's four to go, people.

1967
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,839
You're kidding me.

1968
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,712
Wow, that's amazing.

1969
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,856
All right.

1970
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:55,320
We're joined now
by Esme Manucharian.

1971
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,079
Esme, thanks for joining us.

1972
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,957
Would you say that
the gun debate is now

1973
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,320
largely become
a women's issue?

1974
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,998
You need only
look at the numbers

1975
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,758
to see that gun safety
has become

1976
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,432
a deciding issue
for American women.

1977
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,032
If their representative
isn't listening,

1978
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,160
they'll go to the polls
and elect someone who will.

1979
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,114
What do you want?

1980
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:24,068
I got 15 million to blow.

1981
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,158
Lauren was going
through your letters.

1982
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:30,154
Between the death threats and
the hate mail, she found this.

1983
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,113
Pru Walsh
of The Sentinel is doing

1984
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,456
a feature on
the lobbying industry.

1985
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,549
That means you.

1986
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,920
Well, if she wants to meet me,
why did she send a letter?

1987
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,656
Because she doesn't really
want to meet you.

1988
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:40,976
She wants to say
she reached out to you

1989
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,520
for an interview,
but didn't hear back.

1990
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It's a takedown.

1991
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,840
Well, the least we can do
is disappoint her.

1992
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,360
Set it up.

1993
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,799
I've canceled your 10:00 a.m.

1994
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,400
You're gonna see
our in-house attorney.

1995
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,480
I don't believe
you two have met.

1996
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:57,628
You know how
I feel about this.

1997
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,040
I was against you
ever hiring her.

1998
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,550
Because your job is not
winning lobbying fights,

1999
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,598
your job is
to stop us from getting...

2000
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,960
Quite independently of her
being utterly contemptible.

2001
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,793
What the hell
were you thinking?

2002
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,233
You know, whatever it was,

2003
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,157
I guess it seems
pretty stupid now.

2004
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,156
Liz, meet your protection.

2005
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,238
Daniel Posner, Head of Legal.

2006
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,271
Liz Sloane,
contemptible liability.

2007
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,554
And amateur lip-reader.

2008
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,111
Whose idea were
the glass walls? Seriously?

2009
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,557
Two TV slots tomorrow,

2010
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,076
then a radio thing, and
finally I'm done in Illinois.

2011
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,879
Where are you?

2012
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:47,336
Gold Stone,
waiting for them to hurry up

2013
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,429
and invent the food pill.

2014
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,478
That may take a while.

2015
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,320
And plotting to ensnare
our last four senators.

2016
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:56,074
Fifty-six down, four to go.
We're actually doing... Oh!

2017
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:58,830
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry. My fault.

2018
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,272
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Here you go.

2019
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,040
Okay.

2020
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,714
Sorry about that.

2021
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,916
Remember that first day when
I asked how do we win,

2022
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,758
and you said
"Realistically, we don't"?

2023
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,437
I stand by every word of that.

2024
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,829
Excuse me?

2025
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:19,896
So you're going to downplay
the 15 million?

2026
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:21,056
Yeah, 'cause
we can't sound like

2027
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:23,275
we're bragging about
how much we're pulling in.

2028
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,160
Senators link donations
to voting intention,

2029
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,872
we can't say anything
that might stop...

2030
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,313
You wanna take this, bitch?

2031
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:32,960
Huh?

2032
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:35,720
Esme, you're still there?

2033
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:37,034
Come on.

2034
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,069
Take it.

2035
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,480
Esme? What the hell was that?

2036
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:47,269
You been here before, right?

2037
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,080
Esme?

2038
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,714
Look at me!

2039
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,589
Esme?

2040
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,640
Except I'm gonna
do it right this time.

2041
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:17,976
I'm standing at the scene

2042
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,228
of last night's shooting.

2043
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,799
We understand
that the assailant

2044
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,953
was targeting a leading figure
in the gun control movement,

2045
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,349
and was then shot dead
by a civilian

2046
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,994
carrying a registered,
concealed firearm.

2047
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,399
The name of the vigilante
has yet to be revealed...

2048
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,875
George?

2049
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,519
You're watching the news?

2050
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,672
Yeah, whole bunch of
Christmases

2051
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,233
just came early
for Bill Sandford.

2052
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:45,157
I'm headed to the airport.
Get ready to spend some money.

2053
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,360
Police have confirmed his
identity as Frank McGill.

2054
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:52,510
McGill was a legal owner
of a registered weapon.

2055
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,876
Heaton-Harris wouldn't have
touched him.

2056
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:56,913
But it might
have made it harder

2057
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:58,359
for the other son of a bitch.

2058
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,438
What do we know about him?
Where'd he get his piece?

2059
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,596
Did he have an arsenal
stashed in his basement...

2060
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:05,869
For the Second Amendment,

2061
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,195
which guaranteed her right
to be protected

2062
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,673
from a sick individual.

2063
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,990
And most of all,
for Frank McGill.

2064
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,311
Model citizen,
vigilant, responsible,

2065
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,913
and his aim is true.

2066
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,913
How are you doing?

2067
01:31:58,040 --> 01:31:59,268
You heading home?

2068
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,793
You make a round-trip
from D.C.

2069
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,273
to pin me
in a departure lounge?

2070
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,638
So you can
check me off your list?

2071
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,589
I betrayed your confidence.
I set you down this path.

2072
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,680
"Don't worry, Liz,
it's not your fault."

2073
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,113
Is that what you wanna hear?

2074
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:21,878
"How could you
possibly have known?"

2075
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,999
You're not gonna get it.

2076
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,279
He wanted to kill me.

2077
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,835
I didn't know
where the line was, Esme.

2078
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:47,958
I never, never know
where the line is.

2079
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:58,800
Obviously,
take all the time you want.

2080
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:00,195
And when you're ready,

2081
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,000
we'd love to have you
back on the campaign.

2082
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,108
Your own terms.

2083
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,800
No media, you can work
behind the scenes.

2084
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,479
If you don't want
to work with me,

2085
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,079
I'll resign from the campaign.

2086
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,993
If that's what you want.

2087
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,836
Is that your move
to get me back at my desk?

2088
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:23,759
You want me
in front of a camera

2089
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,159
to counter Frank McGill?

2090
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,355
It even crossed my mind
that this was all you.

2091
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,228
You just didn't account

2092
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,840
for an armed civilian
right behind me.

2093
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,200
Esme...

2094
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:42,753
I'll keep fighting, Elizabeth.

2095
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,353
Wherever I can
make a difference.

2096
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,232
But as far as possible
away from you.

2097
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,078
You crossed the line
when you stopped

2098
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,394
treating people with respect.

2099
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,160
You're smart enough
to know that.

2100
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,029
You just don't care.

2101
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:10,880
Thank you,
thank you. Welcome back.

2102
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,399
Our next guest this morning is

2103
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:13,696
the kind of guy
you'd want to have around

2104
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,551
when you're walking home
from work one night

2105
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,671
and some dude sticks
a gun in your face.

2106
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,016
After his military career,

2107
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,632
McGill worked
as a commercial pilot...

2108
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,576
Let's face it,
folks, the streets ain 't safe.

2109
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,318
And if it wasn't for
the courage, bravery,

2110
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,470
and damn fine aim
of our next guest,

2111
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:30,075
we'd be reflecting
on yet another tragedy.

2112
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,237
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

2113
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,954
the man of the moment,
Frank McGill.

2114
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,670
So, Frank McGill,
all-American hero.

2115
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,512
Not at all.
An ordinary guy

2116
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,113
in the right place
at the right time.

2117
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,120
With
a 9 milli. under his belt.

2118
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,353
I'm curious. The person whose
life you saved once campaigned

2119
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,670
for a ban on concealed carry.

2120
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,273
How do you feel about that?

2121
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,436
I respectfully disagree
with those views.

2122
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,320
But the young lady is
entitled to her opinion

2123
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:01,360
and nobody should be
attacking her for that,

2124
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,153
much less holding her
at gunpoint.

2125
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:05,792
McGill's a gift from God.

2126
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:08,953
But it won't last forever.

2127
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,518
We're looking to parlay that

2128
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,278
into a closer examination
of Sloane.

2129
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,476
I'm thinking of
a Congressional hearing

2130
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,070
into her unorthodox
lobbying practices.

2131
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,955
I'm sure we can find a senator
who may be open to the idea.

2132
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,056
You want to talk trash
about her in the press,

2133
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:27,080
that's one thing.

2134
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:28,872
A Congressional hearing
requires

2135
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,599
a convincing allegation
of impropriety.

2136
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:34,194
I'd give my left nut to drag
her rep through the dirt,

2137
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,594
but you're not gonna get it.

2138
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,557
She's a CYA specialist.

2139
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,989
I've never met
anyone so pedantic...

2140
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,473
Start an inquisition.

2141
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,594
Let's see how well-covered
her ass really is.

2142
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:50,675
Hi.

2143
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,031
Pru Walsh. Thanks so much
for coming over.

2144
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,080
This is Mike Gordon
from our legal department.

2145
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,714
Daniel Posner from ours.

2146
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:00,110
Miss Sloane,
you're at the forefront

2147
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,395
of an industry
with a terrible reputation.

2148
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:03,840
Do you think that's deserved?

2149
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:07,336
The only reason this bill
wasn't passed decades ago

2150
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,120
is because of the power
of special interests.

2151
01:36:09,240 --> 01:36:10,673
When a lobbyist
raises finance...

2152
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,536
We haven't heard
from Esme Manucharian

2153
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,915
since the attack.
Are you in contact with her?

2154
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,439
That's a private matter.

2155
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:19,136
I think what's important
to remember...

2156
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,639
So have you
talked to her at all?

2157
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:23,355
What is important to remember
here is that Frank McGill

2158
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:25,278
is exactly
the kind of law-abiding,

2159
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:27,079
responsible gun owner

2160
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,191
whose rights the
Heaton-Harris Bill protects.

2161
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,960
Do you feel any guilt
about what happened?

2162
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,514
Why would I feel guilt?

2163
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,916
You made Esme the face
of your campaign.

2164
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,599
You thrust her
into the limelight

2165
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,795
that night on the debate.

2166
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,536
- I'm not talking about this.
- You don't have to.

2167
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,576
Did she know
that you were going to

2168
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,556
out her on national TV?
Did she agree to that?

2169
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:45,229
Why not report that
the majority of gun owners

2170
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,118
favor more extensive
background checks?

2171
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,536
She probably went
her entire career

2172
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:49,736
trying to keep that
a carefully guarded secret.

2173
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:50,936
That the gun lobby's
fear-mongering rhetoric

2174
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,200
is trying to paint Heaton-Harris
into something it's not.

2175
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:55,280
Do you think
that your little revelation

2176
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,272
is what made her a target?

2177
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,435
It's clear Miss Sloane

2178
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,696
doesn't wish to discuss
Ms. Manucharian.

2179
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,800
What's really clear is that

2180
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,080
your article's
already written.

2181
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,376
Don't respond to that.

2182
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,920
That's purely speculative
on your part.

2183
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,957
- Who's controlling you?
- Let's not do this.

2184
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,840
Look, the fact is,
you have no way of knowing

2185
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,120
what Ms. Walsh
intends to do...

2186
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,536
The fact is that
you have no interest

2187
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,834
in what Miss Sloane
has to say.

2188
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,360
- And how would you know that?
- Your Dictaphone's off.

2189
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:22,079
Takedown.

2190
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:23,800
It could've been worse.

2191
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,990
I've got four
factual errors so far.

2192
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:27,788
This is not good, Liz.

2193
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,399
Dump it in the recycling.

2194
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,680
They'll make
pencils out of it.

2195
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,480
Maybe one will
find its way into

2196
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,272
the hands of a reporter
with some integrity.

2197
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,749
It will go away.

2198
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:39,474
Okay, thank you.

2199
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,120
Bye.

2200
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:47,509
Funny how all these senators
are suddenly very busy.

2201
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,438
We all know why that is.

2202
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:57,073
Okay, so it's not great.

2203
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,071
The 15 million
helped us get this far,

2204
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,920
but it doesn't last long
when you're fighting

2205
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,228
the richest group on the Hill.

2206
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,589
Let's get to the point.

2207
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,136
How does it shake out
when it comes to the vote?

2208
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:08,993
We'd run them close.
But by latest projections,

2209
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,790
we'll be between four
to seven votes short.

2210
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,880
There's nothing more
we can do tonight.

2211
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:17,388
Liz, we don't have to leave.

2212
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:19,153
The West Coast is still awake.

2213
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,616
We can
connect with Oregon.

2214
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:21,993
If we close those
goddamn loggers,

2215
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:23,496
we could get it
to five votes tonight.

2216
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,511
Go home
and get some rest, guys.

2217
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:26,800
You've done enough for today.

2218
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,136
I'll take to the streets
and rip down those

2219
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,720
fucking Frank McGill posters
one at a time if I have to.

2220
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:33,991
Go home,
sharpen your knives.

2221
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,759
It'll still be on tomorrow.

2222
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,639
So we keep on fighting.

2223
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,873
That's all we can do.

2224
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,159
As my ex-wife used to say.

2225
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,480
I met you running
from a fundraiser.

2226
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:24,440
You could be done
with all this.

2227
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,194
Why don't you quit?

2228
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,193
And do what?

2229
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:49,519
Good night.

2230
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:26,269
Hello?

2231
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,353
I'm surprised you picked up.

2232
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:33,473
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.

2233
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:52,760
She'd ply Congressmen
with benefits,

2234
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,676
free meals, tickets to events,
golfing weekends.

2235
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,194
All paid for by our clients,
via the firm.

2236
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,759
Well, that right there's
enough.

2237
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,592
She'd make a point
of invoicing them,

2238
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:04,517
though they were never
expected to pay.

2239
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,896
The debt shows as an asset
on our balance sheet.

2240
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:08,797
We can call it in
any time we want.

2241
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,916
You were her
right hand for two years.

2242
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,030
There's got to be something.

2243
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,953
Why's nobody
on her files?

2244
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,376
There were a ton of us,
but the others got pulled out.

2245
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,136
It's not like we're in danger
of finding anything.

2246
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:24,354
Well, how far d'you get?

2247
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,998
We worked backwards
from her last deal

2248
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,229
before she jumped ship.

2249
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:28,536
They said it'd
be better if we can

2250
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:29,720
nail her on something recent.

2251
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,955
- Which was?
- Shmallow Cakes.

2252
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,115
Some tax thing.

2253
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:35,111
She left halfway through.

2254
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:36,792
I thought it was
the palm oil thing.

2255
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,955
Palm oil?

2256
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,268
Nutella Tax.

2257
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,829
Hold on.

2258
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:44,838
The Indonesians?

2259
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,400
I don't
remember seeing that.

2260
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,394
What are you looking for?

2261
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:00,428
Mr. Dupont,

2262
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,758
she's in breach of
Senate Ethics rules.

2263
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,549
We can prove it.

2264
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,119
Things not looking so good
for you this cycle, Ron.

2265
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:32,438
You ask me, you're gonna need
a lot more paid media.

2266
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,040
I didn't ask you.

2267
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:38,949
Now, who might just be able to
fund those coveted TV spots?

2268
01:43:39,320 --> 01:43:41,038
I'm committed
to Heaton-Harris,

2269
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,998
I can't vote for it
with one hand

2270
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:44,879
and choke it with the other.

2271
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,951
Under cover of impartiality,
sure you can.

2272
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,512
You've been a vocal critic
of lobbyists in the past.

2273
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,553
You'll lead an inquiry
into Sloane's affairs

2274
01:43:53,640 --> 01:43:55,915
in response to
growing media pressure

2275
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,310
regarding her
litany of misdeeds.

2276
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,311
The cost of hearings
is paid from the public purse.

2277
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,389
Ron, our clients
have identified you

2278
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,596
as the man to pull this off.

2279
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,755
If you decline,

2280
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,273
I can't stop them from

2281
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,715
blitzing you
with negative finance.

2282
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,631
They won't stop
until they annihilate you.

2283
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:21,600
You know the root
of the word "annihilate"?

2284
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:23,795
It's Latin.

2285
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,470
It means, "reduce to nothing."

2286
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,470
That's what they're
going to do to you, Ron.

2287
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:34,632
So, what? I'll be taking
a wedge from Bill Sandford

2288
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:36,748
and leading the attack

2289
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:39,070
on Heaton-Harris'
most visible advocate?

2290
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,276
A 6th grader could
connect the dots.

2291
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,909
We can create a structure
to obfuscate the source.

2292
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:46,958
Your big wedge will arrive

2293
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,077
courtesy of eight to 12 smaller entities

2294
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,116
with no affiliation to guns.

2295
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:56,999
How big a wedge we talking?

2296
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,233
Big enough

2297
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,593
to be the difference between

2298
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,398
the continuation
of your duties

2299
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,152
as a United States Senator

2300
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,354
and the reduction
of your career to nothing.

2301
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,474
This is every hit since

2302
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,915
the original Pru Walsh
hack-job two weeks ago.

2303
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,279
My personal favorite
is the one

2304
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:33,429
about how you toppled

2305
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:34,896
the head of the High School
Student Council

2306
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,831
with a fabricated
plagiarism scandal.

2307
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:39,278
I'm assuming
that's not libelous

2308
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,793
'cause I can totally see it.

2309
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,718
That witch was insufferable.

2310
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,360
I'm taking you
off the campaign.

2311
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,600
What?

2312
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:49,033
Not you, her.

2313
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,235
I'll be outside.

2314
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:54,193
What are you talking about?

2315
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,474
Heaton-Harris gets colder

2316
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:56,960
every day you're
associated with it.

2317
01:45:57,960 --> 01:45:59,200
Sperling's got
the hots for you.

2318
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,478
I haven't even met him,
this is a setup.

2319
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,319
If they're orchestrating it,

2320
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,080
it's because they want me
off the campaign.

2321
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,040
Right now, you're lawyering up
for a hearing.

2322
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,136
Regarding your representation

2323
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,354
of the Indonesian government.

2324
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:17,714
Dan, are you busy?

2325
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,000
Senator Allen Jacobs,

2326
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:22,636
the sponsor of the bill
you dubbed the Nutella Tax,

2327
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,990
was flown to Indonesia
first-class with his family,

2328
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,430
and put up at a 5-star hotel.

2329
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:34,119
Our audit puts the cost
of this trip at over $30,000.

2330
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,152
Shortly after his return,

2331
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,913
the bill was pulled
from consideration.

2332
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:42,796
Now, why do you suppose
this happened?

2333
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:45,678
I understand the trip was
for educational purposes.

2334
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:48,354
I can surmise that
he learned how his bill

2335
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:49,953
would have strangled
a key industry,

2336
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,553
and confined thousands

2337
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:54,279
of impoverished farmers
to destitution.

2338
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,078
From his private beach?

2339
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:00,470
No. The truth is,
your client funded this trip

2340
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,797
as an inducement for the
senator to withdraw his bill.

2341
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,513
- Isn't that right?
- Not at all.

2342
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,318
My client was
the Indonesian Government.

2343
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,634
The trip was sponsored

2344
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,392
by the Institute of
Environmental Studies,

2345
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:13,552
a 501 C-3
non-profit organization.

2346
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:14,755
Travel was pre-approved

2347
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,671
by the Senate Ethics
Committee.

2348
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,558
Has your client ever
donated to this non-profit?

2349
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,228
I wouldn't know that.

2350
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:22,958
I'm not privy
to their list of donors.

2351
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:26,072
Nor had I any role
in arranging funding for this.

2352
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,313
- No role?
- Mmm.

2353
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,349
Of course,
you couldn't have any role

2354
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,912
because the Senate Ethics
rules prevent lobbyists

2355
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:38,073
from arranging overseas travel
for members of Congress.

2356
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,388
Indeed.

2357
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,268
Do you know what this is?

2358
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,600
Perhaps we can get you a copy.

2359
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:56,879
Are you familiar
with that form?

2360
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,197
Yes. It's a Private Sponsor
Certification Form.

2361
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:01,918
It's a copy of the same

2362
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,718
Private Sponsor
Certification Form

2363
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:06,075
that was submitted
to the Senate Ethics Committee

2364
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,879
to pre-authorize
Senator Jacobs' travel

2365
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:10,149
to Indonesia.

2366
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,274
Look at the handwriting
on that form, Miss Sloane.

2367
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,878
Do you recognize
that handwriting?

2368
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,755
Yes, I do.

2369
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,120
Is it your handwriting?

2370
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:24,269
It is.

2371
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,078
Well, it seems
we have a problem.

2372
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,956
Even though
the form was signed

2373
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:32,189
and filed by the non-profit,

2374
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,998
you were the one
who filled it out.

2375
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,198
This is prima facie evidence

2376
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,311
that you were involved
in arranging

2377
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,391
overseas travel for
a member of Congress.

2378
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:44,994
Constituting a clear breach
of Senate Ethics rules.

2379
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,639
Is that your trump card?

2380
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,474
You drag me in here,

2381
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:51,710
wedge an endoscope
up my posterior,

2382
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:54,554
and all this time,
the only incriminating item

2383
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:57,279
you have in your possession
is a filing snafu?

2384
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,237
How about surveillance,
Miss Sloane?

2385
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,557
Mr. Rodolfo Schmidt
has stated in deposition

2386
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,235
that you intended
to use methods

2387
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,038
such as bugging and tapping

2388
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,351
to entrap Senator
Hank Badgley. Is this true?

2389
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,870
I did, for a brief moment,
intend to use such methods.

2390
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:15,996
But that intention
was never acted upon.

2391
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,229
And why was that?

2392
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:19,271
Mr. Schmidt
expressly forbade it,

2393
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,316
as he no doubt told you
in his deposition.

2394
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,536
But you were clearly
comfortable

2395
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,595
with these methods.

2396
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:27,316
Did you employ the tactics
of espionage

2397
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:29,595
regularly throughout
your lobbying career?

2398
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:30,954
No, I did not.

2399
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,136
Then let me ask you this.

2400
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,071
Have you ever authorized,
ordered,

2401
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:35,752
or otherwise brought about

2402
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,917
any kind of unlawful
surveillance on any person?

2403
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:41,951
Let me remind you that perjury

2404
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:43,758
before Congress
is a felony, which...

2405
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:44,875
The answer is no.

2406
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,597
I have never authorized
illegal surveillance.

2407
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,151
This concludes my questioning
of the witness.

2408
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:56,559
Thank you, Miss Sloane.

2409
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:07,199
We have one further witness.

2410
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:10,751
Either you just
perjured yourself,

2411
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,671
or you're not
so sleazy after all.

2412
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,280
The Committee
calls Mr. Robert Forde.

2413
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:17,439
I wouldn't count on that.

2414
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:20,628
Mr. Chairman, I don't recall

2415
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,200
being notified
of your intention to...

2416
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:23,275
We were only recently

2417
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,696
able to locate
the witness, Mr. Posner.

2418
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,755
Let it play.

2419
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:28,192
A moment
with my client, please?

2420
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:30,871
What is this?
Who's Robert Forde?

2421
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,639
Look, I can make
a public appeal...

2422
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:34,755
Let it play, damn it.

2423
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,920
They're going to get it
out there one way or another.

2424
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:52,715
Mr. Forde,
please raise your right hand.

2425
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,076
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,

2426
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:58,071
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

2427
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,192
under pains and penalties
of perjury?

2428
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,078
- I swear.
- Please sit.

2429
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:10,314
Mr. Forde,
could you please describe

2430
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,992
the nature of your work?

2431
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:15,879
I got many jobs.

2432
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,077
What would you say earns you
the most income at present?

2433
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,000
I work as an escort in D.C.

2434
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,432
You sleep
with women for money?

2435
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,479
I meet the clients' needs.

2436
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,674
Whatever they may be.

2437
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,359
Sometimes, the client don't
even know what they need.

2438
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,071
Part of my job's
to figure that out.

2439
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:43,798
But, sometimes,
your job entails

2440
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:46,237
having intercourse
for payment?

2441
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,194
Yes, sir.

2442
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,036
Have you ever met
Elizabeth Sloane?

2443
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:53,656
Mr. Chairman, the Senate
has no business

2444
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,560
prying into the personal
affairs of Miss Sloane.

2445
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,000
Solicitation
is a criminal offense.

2446
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,395
It's well within the remit
of this hearing

2447
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,799
to establish
whether Miss Sloane

2448
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:01,949
has broken any laws.

2449
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:03,835
Mr. Forde.

2450
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,715
Have you ever met Miss Sloane?

2451
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:09,395
Yep.

2452
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,398
Could you
identify her, please?

2453
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,869
Sittin' right there.

2454
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:18,029
What was the nature
of your relationship?

2455
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,150
I was attendin'
a function with a client.

2456
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I tried to introduce myself,
but she bucked me off.

2457
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:29,833
Mr. Forde, have you ever

2458
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,320
entertained Miss Sloane
as a client?

2459
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:37,509
No, sir.

2460
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,157
I can produce sworn statements

2461
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:43,674
from two employees
of the Carver Hotel,

2462
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,672
to the effect that they saw
Miss Sloane in the lobby

2463
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,917
on the same day
that you, Mr. Forde,

2464
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,513
held a reservation there.

2465
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,029
I ask again.

2466
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:56,073
Did you entertain Miss Sloane
in any capacity, for profit?

2467
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,508
No, sir. I did not.

2468
01:53:01,080 --> 01:53:02,752
Thank you,
Mr. Forde.

2469
01:53:03,560 --> 01:53:04,879
You're dismissed.

2470
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,277
These proceedings
will conclude tomorrow,

2471
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,955
when Miss Sloane is referred
to the Senate Ethics Committee

2472
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,439
for their judgment.

2473
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,315
I can't believe those fuckers
dragged that guy...

2474
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,549
Ross?

2475
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,800
How's our old friend
Heaton-Harris?

2476
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,829
Comatose. The whole
issue's gone cold.

2477
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,313
That is what they wanted.

2478
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:49,680
We all know what
it would take to revive it.

2479
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,910
Seriously, an earthquake.

2480
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:57,231
We got closer than
we had any right to.

2481
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:07,599
We'll all be there tomorrow.

2482
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:43,336
Excuse me,
Miss Sloane, over here.

2483
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,475
May I have a comment?

2484
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:03,709
Good morning.

2485
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:12,309
Before referring
the witness's testimony

2486
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,436
to the Office
of Congressional Ethics,

2487
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,158
she is entitled
to make a statement.

2488
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,436
Miss Sloane, is there
something you'd like to say?

2489
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,961
Mr. Chairman, my client does
not wish to make a statement.

2490
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:40,875
Very well.

2491
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:42,473
I will now read the referral

2492
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,312
to the office of
Congressional Ethics...

2493
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,197
There is something
I'd like to say, Senator.

2494
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:18,553
I have been censured by
the press and by this hearing

2495
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:20,799
as a parasite

2496
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,398
on American democracy.

2497
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:27,200
It's insinuated
that I led the fight

2498
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:32,438
for increased gun regulation
in the interest of my career.

2499
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,196
Sometimes we act,
not for ourselves,

2500
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:41,955
but because we believe
plainly and simply

2501
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,433
it is the right thing to do.

2502
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:46,068
Miss Sloane, is this pertinent
to the discussions we...

2503
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:49,277
I understand I have the right
to say what I wish, Senator.

2504
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:51,440
Proceed.

2505
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:55,192
I believe
the Heaton-Harris Bill

2506
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:56,594
is the right thing to do.

2507
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:00,874
But I also recognize

2508
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:05,479
that this wasn't
what motivated me.

2509
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,515
When I was offered a position
on the campaign,

2510
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,591
I was in thrall
to the challenge.

2511
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:19,830
My decision to accept
was based on my desire to win.

2512
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,631
And to win bigger
than I ever had before.

2513
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:32,758
It's clear that my behavior
has fallen well short

2514
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,471
of acceptable
ethical standards.

2515
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:43,359
I've crossed lines
with devastating consequences

2516
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,391
in the service
of my obsession.

2517
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:50,910
I've betrayed the people
closest to me.

2518
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:55,873
I've endangered lives.

2519
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,512
I deserve censure for this

2520
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,677
far more than for
any filing irregularity.

2521
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:10,154
When they consider
the Heaton-Harris Bill, I wish

2522
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,192
that each member of Congress

2523
01:58:13,320 --> 01:58:15,595
would follow the example set,
not by me,

2524
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:19,873
but by the group of people
that sit behind me.

2525
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,075
Who have made great sacrifices

2526
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,195
in the name of doing
what they believe is right.

2527
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:33,958
I wish that those members
would use their votes,

2528
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:37,953
not in the interest of
their political advancement,

2529
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:43,197
but for what they believe
is right for their country.

2530
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:46,958
But I know my wishes
are wasted.

2531
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:50,112
And that this will
never happen.

2532
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:54,870
Because our system is rotten.

2533
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,675
It doesn't reward
honest politicians,

2534
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,034
who vote with
their conscience.

2535
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,233
It rewards

2536
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:06,469
rats

2537
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:09,357
who are willing to
sell out their country

2538
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:10,760
to keep their noses
in the trough.

2539
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:14,278
Make no mistake.

2540
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:18,357
These rats are
the real parasites

2541
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:20,992
on American democracy.

2542
01:59:34,240 --> 01:59:36,913
I anticipated if we had
sufficient success

2543
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:38,991
in lobbying for
the Heaton-Harris Bill,

2544
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:40,479
there may be

2545
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:43,591
an assault
against me personally,

2546
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:49,512
to stall our momentum
and to damage our credibility.

2547
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,273
Lobbying is about foresight.

2548
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:58,111
About anticipating
your opponent's moves

2549
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:01,508
and devising counter-measures.

2550
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,833
I'd like to discuss my future.

2551
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,472
This is hardly
the time, cookie.

2552
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:10,636
The winner plots one step
ahead of the opposition,

2553
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:15,829
and plays a trump card
just after they play theirs.

2554
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:18,073
Actually, it is the time.

2555
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,240
It's about making sure

2556
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:21,508
you surprise them.

2557
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:24,039
The fuck is this?

2558
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,199
And that they don't
surprise you.

2559
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,399
My resignation.

2560
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,632
Academia's more my scene.

2561
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:38,632
When I left Cole, Kravitz,
and Waterman,

2562
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:43,196
I retained an operative
of mine in their ranks.

2563
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,233
All right, Jane.

2564
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:47,616
Contact Rodolfo Schmidt
and tell him

2565
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,016
there is a total
of six coming over.

2566
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:50,075
Who says I'm coming?

2567
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,280
A plan was hatched to

2568
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,480
bankroll a trumped-up hearing

2569
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,837
at the behest
of the gun lobby.

2570
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:57,433
There's got to be something.

2571
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:00,480
I'm surprised you picked up.

2572
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,040
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.

2573
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:05,280
She's in breach
of Senate Ethics rules.

2574
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,509
We can prove it.

2575
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:10,350
I placed George Dupont
under surveillance

2576
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,357
until he met with
a member of Congress

2577
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:15,950
who exhibited sufficient
moral bankruptcy

2578
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:18,715
to collude with such a plan.

2579
02:01:18,840 --> 02:01:20,034
And go.

2580
02:01:23,760 --> 02:01:25,557
That member was

2581
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:28,035
Senator
Ronald Michael Sperling.

2582
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:31,275
Order.

2583
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,351
This is not a platform
you can use

2584
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,160
to make malicious,
defamatory accusations...

2585
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:37,040
Input the following address
into your browser.

2586
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:42,870
193-dot-184

2587
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:48,873
dot-216-dot-449.

2588
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:52,756
Download a file
named "Earthquake."

2589
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,516
I can't
vote for it with one hand

2590
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,238
and choke it with the other...

2591
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:08,634
Get the car.

2592
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,748
In light of these allegations,
this hearing is adjourned.

2593
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:30,839
Back up, please.
Back up. Back up.

2594
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:09,279
I'm surprised you showed.

2595
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,160
I hear I'm not the only one

2596
02:04:11,200 --> 02:04:12,520
whose visits
you've been refusing.

2597
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:16,873
You look good.

2598
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:19,711
Prison's not so bad
if you don't have a penis.

2599
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:22,509
We don't shank each other,
we form self-help groups.

2600
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:25,440
There's a black market
in lip gloss.

2601
02:04:25,720 --> 02:04:26,720
Hmm.

2602
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:29,029
Why this time?

2603
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:32,873
They told me it was business.

2604
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,714
Yeah. Um...

2605
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:36,856
Now that the Sperling
and Dupont hearings

2606
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:37,949
are on the schedule,

2607
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,519
I'm petitioning
for an early release.

2608
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:41,554
You look good, too,
by the way.

2609
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,393
Thank you.

2610
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:48,235
I think we are looking
at four, maybe six months.

2611
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:55,113
You instigated
the whole thing.

2612
02:04:58,280 --> 02:04:59,793
You weaponized yourself,

2613
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:02,678
brought the roof
of the US Capitol

2614
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,079
crashing down on your head.

2615
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,150
For what, a gun bill?

2616
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:11,469
- Worked, didn't it?
- Well, congrats.

2617
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:13,840
Criminals must now
endure the hassle

2618
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,672
of procuring their guns
on the black market.

2619
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:19,158
Was that really
worth your career?

2620
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,272
Career suicide is
not so bad when you

2621
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:26,000
consider the alternative
is suicide by career.

2622
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:29,114
My doctor would tell you

2623
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,437
I've served
my interest very well.

2624
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:35,200
Hmm.

2625
02:05:38,160 --> 02:05:39,434
Thanks for coming, Daniel.

2626
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,388
I'm curious.

2627
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,553
Your little filing snafu?

2628
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,920
You filled out
that form deliberately.

2629
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,360
That was you,
throwing them a bone.

2630
02:05:53,680 --> 02:05:55,961
Without it, they would have
nothing to incite the hearing.

2631
02:05:57,160 --> 02:05:59,116
And you're under no obligation
to answer that.

2632
02:06:05,360 --> 02:06:06,839
And you neglected
to mention this

2633
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,160
to any of your team because...

2634
02:06:08,200 --> 02:06:09,315
Five years minimum.

2635
02:06:16,240 --> 02:06:17,434
I'll be seeing you.

2635
02:06:18,305 --> 02:07:18,651
