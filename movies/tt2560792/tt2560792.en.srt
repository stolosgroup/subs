<i>beautiful.</i>

00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:34,147

want to return to the ground?</i>

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,341
<i>Can I be honest with you,
Matt?</i>

8
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:45,810
Sure thing, Lisa, go ahead.

9
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,413
You know, I was expecting you
to ask me on a date

10
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,414
ever since med school started.

11
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:52,283
You took your time
until tonight.

12
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:54,152
Actually I was only waiting
for a special occasion...

13
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:55,954
But if you're trying
to impress me

14
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,955
with this expensive car,
then...

15
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:00,727
I think you might
just have the wrong girl.

16
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:03,828
Oh, Lisa, I'm not,
seriously.

17
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,800
This was the only car
left at home.

18
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,366
I'm sorry... I think
it would just be better

19
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,271
if you take me back home.

20
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,705
Oh... Come on.

21
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,407
Lisa,
I had no choice about the car.

22
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,175
My mom is gonna kill me
when she finds out

23
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:19,144
I took it for this
three-day vacation.

24
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:22,717
Lisa?

25
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:26,949
Damn it.

26
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:29,890
I'm just messing with you.

27
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,092
I'm sorry, Matt, it's just...

28
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:37,729
this car probably costs more
than the house I grew up in.

29
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,364
I seriously doubt that.

30
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,299
Oh, look, my dad's
calling from Toronto.

31
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:43,168
Maybe you want to ask him.

32
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,103
Hey, Dad, just a few hours
since I left.

33
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:46,837
Do you already miss me?

34
00:03:46,839 --> 00:03:48,740
<i>Oh honey,
you know I always do.</i>

35
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:51,175
<i>But right now I need to
know if by any chance</i>

36
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:53,478
- <i>you left some cash here.</i>
- Some cash?

37
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm afraid I ordered
some drugs for my asthma.

38
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,483
But now I can't pay
the delivery boy

39
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,185
because I didn't make it
to the ATM today.

40
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:02,886
Unfortunately,
the neighbors are out too.

41
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:04,988
But anyway,
I only need like, 10 bucks.

42
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,292
Look, Mr. Murphy,
I gotta be on my way.

43
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,158
<i>Just order again
when you can afford it.</i>

44
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,396
Dad?
Dad, let me talk to this guy.

45
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:13,930
<i>Maybe there are a few dollars
in my bedroom drawer.</i>

46
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,099
All right, here.
My daughter for you.

47
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:18,302
Uh...

48
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:20,437
Great, Lisa Murphy.

49
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,172
David?

50
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,941
David Spencer, is that you?

51
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:27,111
Wow, we haven't talked since
you broke up with Katie.

52
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:28,747
Shame.

53
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:31,080
Listen David,
can I pay this online?

54
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:32,750
I've got this banking
app thing on my phone.

55
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,319
It should only take
a few minutes.

56
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,487
Uh... nope.

57
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,121
Can't do that Murphy.

58
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,056
You know what?

59
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:44,027
You sound almost as desperate
as Katie always did.

60
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:46,463
Funny, David.
Desperate is just

61
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:48,833
what I thought
when I saw that video of you.

62
00:04:48,835 --> 00:04:50,502
You know, the one where
you're drunk and naked

63
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,807
and tried to do it with
Katie's German Shepherd?

64
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,006
I mean,
thank God the poor animal

65
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:59,109
managed to get away in time.

66
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:01,145
You, uh...

67
00:05:01,147 --> 00:05:03,781
you still got that video?

68
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:05,248
Now I remember.

69
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,150
You weren't totally naked.

70
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:10,822
You were wearing those
yellow neon tennis socks.

71
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:12,490
<i>Should get a few clicks
on YouTube.</i>

72
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,391
What?
Uh...

73
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:15,860
Uh, Lisa, don't do that.

74
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,294
Uh, Mr. Murphy,

75
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:19,229
just forget
about the money, okay?

76
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,301
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

77
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,068
Lisa, what did you tell him?

78
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,870
Everything's fine Dad.

79
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:28,473
Just remember to refill
your medication, okay?

80
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,908
Promise.
Talk to you on New Years Eve.

81
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,376
Take care of yourself, honey.

82
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:33,910
You too, Dad.

83
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:35,412
Remind me never to
tick you off.

84
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,958
Hey... did we just enter
an airport?

85
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:49,295
Maybe.

86
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,996
But I thought we were
meeting Roxy and Odin

87
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:54,802
at your country house.

88
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:05,275
Don't worry, Lisa.

89
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:09,414
It's weird... somebody's
supposed to be here by now.

90
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,354
Matt, what's going on?

91
00:06:18,123 --> 00:06:20,457
Look, truth is,

92
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,893
my parents
don't own a country house

93
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:23,595
in the state of New York.

94
00:06:23,597 --> 00:06:27,397
However, we do own a beach
house in Los Angeles,

95
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,933
Malibu to be precise.

96
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:32,807
Malibu?

97
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:38,275
What's wrong?

98
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,446
Get out of the car!

99
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:56,260
Odin, are you
out of your fucking mind?

100
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:59,029
Easy, Parker.
You deserve it.

101
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,530
Kept us waiting for like
30 minutes.

102
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,532
Lisa,
did we really scare you?

103
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,301
Please, you have to forgive us.

104
00:07:05,303 --> 00:07:06,570
It's good to see you too,
Roxy.

105
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,304
Now please don't tell me that...

106
00:07:08,306 --> 00:07:11,376
We're flying to California,
baby, whoo!

107
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,246
Guys, I can't just...

108
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:19,482
Well, you did pack for
three days, didn't you?

109
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:21,618
So what's the difference?

110
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,987
Of course it'll be a little
warmer on the West Coast.

111
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,390
And a friend of mine
is gonna take us all

112
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:31,296
to Vin Diesel's movie
premiere tomorrow night.

113
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,400
And this is how we'll be
getting there.

114
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:39,669
Our Freedom XJ One, with
over 6,000 miles of range

115
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:42,239
and speeds of up to
700 miles per hour.

116
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,174
It's my dad's private plane.

117
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:46,676
He made me get my pilot's
license after my 18th birthday

118
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:51,280
so I could use it for...
special occasions.

119
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,123
Well...

120
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,157
what are we waiting for?

121
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:02,458
Whoo!

122
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,361
My thoughts exactly.

123
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:06,899
Come help me with my stuff,
would you?

124
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:11,034
You have to tell me
everything.

125
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:12,703
Did you two already kiss?

126
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,237
He hasn't tried,
unfortunately.

127
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,275
There he is, finally.

128
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:23,013
<i>Ay, dios mio!</i>

129
00:08:23,015 --> 00:08:24,681
I hope speeding
doesn't run in the family.

130
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:26,152
You should see us fly.

131
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,020
Is this your brother Kyle?

132
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:33,390
But he's not coming with us,
is he?

133
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:34,990
No, he's just here
for the handoff.

134
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,392
He piloted the plane
from Paris today

135
00:08:36,394 --> 00:08:38,996
where our parents spend
Christmas.

136
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,435
Hey, little brother,
where have you been?

137
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:47,770
People have been waiting.

138
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:49,740
Sorry,
I arrived a little early,

139
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:52,378
so I took the bike for a spin.

140
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:06,054
Hi, Lisa.

141
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:07,426
Hello, Kyle.

142
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:11,528
Kyle, what's up?

143
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,998
Rosario.

144
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,301
Come on, Lisa,
heaven awaits us.

145
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,378
This way, ladies.

146
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:29,077
O-M-G!

147
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:31,147
This is awesome.

148
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,716
Heaven really was
the right word.

149
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:35,552
Look at this.
This baby's got everything...

150
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,621
TV, stereo, a bar!

151
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,824
And it's well-stocked, too.

152
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:48,698
I'll have a vodka
on the rocks.

153
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,299
Coming right up, my lady.

154
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:52,337
Let me just get
my canvases out.

155
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,443
Ground control,
this is FJ2244.

156
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,812
Request permission
for takeoff.

157
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:04,548
<i>Ground control to FJ2244,</i>

158
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,183
<i>thanks for submitting your
flight plan, Mr. Parker.</i>

159
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:10,786
<i>However, the name of your
co-pilot seems to be missing.</i>

160
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:12,756
I'm sorry...
please repeat.

161
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,658
Name of my co-pilot?

162
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,693
<i>As you know,
since December 1st,</i>

163
00:10:16,695 --> 00:10:19,462
<i>a co-pilot is required for
all aircrafts of your type</i>

164
00:10:19,464 --> 00:10:21,798
<i>departing
the State of New York.</i>

165
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,666
New regulations
since December 1st

166
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:25,167
requiring a co-pilot.

167
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:26,469
What's he talking about?

168
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,236
I have no idea.

169
00:10:28,238 --> 00:10:31,207
- I landed alone.
- <i>Mr. Parker,</i>

170
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:33,341
<i>please let me
speak to your co-pilot.</i>

171
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,213
<i>Hello?
Mr. Parker?</i>

172
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,482
Hold on, ground control.

173
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,815
What now?

174
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:41,550
I mean, you could talk to
him now,

175
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:43,119
but he's gonna ask again
once we're in the air.

176
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:44,855
- I know.
- <i>Mr. Parker,</i>

177
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:46,823
<i>I'm afraid we have to deny
your request for takeoff</i>

178
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,757
- <i>if you do not...</i>
- Ground control,

179
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,696
this is Kyle Parker speaking,
co-pilot of this flight.

180
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,197
Screw it, I'll fly with you.
I was gonna come out

181
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,332
to the West Coast
in three days anyway.

182
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,268
<i>Thank you, FJ2244.</i>

183
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,804
<i>You are cleared
for departure.</i>

184
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,706
<i>Proceed to taxi lane.</i>

185
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,642
Kyle, Kyle man,
how can I ever thank you?

186
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,444
This would've ruined
everything.

187
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:11,380
Hey, you know, this thing
with you and Lisa,

188
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,182
it's over right?

189
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:15,519
I mean, it was nothing
serious anyway, was it?

190
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,621
Are you kidding?
Seriously, it was nothing.

191
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:21,322
Besides, I'll be out of your
hair as soon as we hit L.A.

192
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:23,461
Hey, bro.

193
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:26,928
Merry Christmas.

194
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,767
To you too, Matt.

195
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:32,504
- Bathroom door's at the back?
- Right.

196
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,790
What is this supposed to
mean?

197
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:54,557
Lisa, I didn't want you
to see that.

198
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,796
Just... forget about it,
okay?

199
00:11:59,229 --> 00:12:00,796
No, Kyle,
you'll tell me why

200
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:04,265
you never answered
any of my calls right now.

201
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,839
I have a right to know.
Tell me.

202
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:11,472
You told me you had no
idea who I was, right?

203
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,475
I mean, when we
first met at that party,

204
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:18,246
you said you had no idea my
family owned Parker Industries.

205
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,282
Yeah, I suppose so.

206
00:12:20,284 --> 00:12:23,752
That's not what your
friend Becca told me.

207
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,789
So after a weekend
of feeling closer

208
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,389
than I ever felt to any girl,

209
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,960
I had to find out
that Becca told you in advance

210
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:32,528
who was going to that party.

211
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,962
That kind of thing

212
00:12:33,964 --> 00:12:35,597
just happened
too often in my life.

213
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,533
What?
Are you trying to say that...

214
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:39,301
You knew who I was
when we met.

215
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,904
I didn't!
Becca mentioned

216
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:42,705
so many people who were
coming to that party,

217
00:12:42,707 --> 00:12:45,844
by the time I arrived,
I didn't know anyone.

218
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,748
Fine, if you really think
I was with you

219
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,917
just because you're rich,

220
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,757
you're an even bigger
asshole than I thought.

221
00:13:02,325 --> 00:13:03,694
Lisa...

222
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,366
<i>But hasn't the world
in general</i>

223
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:13,402
<i>become a much safer place
since the end of the Cold War?</i>

224
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:15,537
<i>Just remember
those massive forces,</i>

225
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,971
<i>the Russians
and the Americans...</i>

226
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:18,673
<i>But do you really
feel better,</i>

227
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:21,043
<i>with those massive weapons</i>

228
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:23,779
<i>repeatedly showing up
on the black market...</i>

229
00:13:23,781 --> 00:13:25,047
Sound's there,
but wrong input.

230
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:26,849
Yeah, I can hear that.

231
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,784
<i>In this world,
terrible things can happen</i>

232
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:32,020
- <i>any day.</i>
- You're damn right, honey,

233
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:34,822
which is why we should
party as long as we can.

234
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,776
I've always wanted
to do this.

235
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:38,886
- Oh, yeah.
- Ohh!

236
00:14:38,888 --> 00:14:41,057
Oh, yeah.

237
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,727
- Ohh...
- Ah!

238
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:53,671
He wants to talk to you.

239
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,711
Hey.

240
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:04,979
Hey.

241
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,414
Wanna take a seat?

242
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,950
Yeah.

243
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,888
How are you?

244
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,122
Good, thanks.

245
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:16,957
I, uh...
I'm just a little tired.

246
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,595
Well, if you can keep your
eyes open a little longer,

247
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:22,028
there's something
you might wanna see,

248
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,767
right over there.

249
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,712
So beautiful.

250
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,412
Put your hands on the yoke.

251
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:37,712
Excuse me?

252
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:39,447
The stick.

253
00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:40,849
The controls.

254
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:43,017
Oh...
No, no, really.

255
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,889
- I, uh...
- Come on, it's easy.

256
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:59,033
You see,
there's nothing to it.

257
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:03,037
Now push it forward
just a little bit.

258
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:13,150
Now try moving
a little to the right.

259
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:24,529
This is like a dream.

260
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:38,742
Phew.

261
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,646
What's up with him?

262
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:49,787
Autopilot's running now.

263
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,055
Thank you so much.

264
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:57,826
Honestly, I've never seen
anything as beautiful as this.

265
00:16:57,828 --> 00:16:59,664
Me neither.

266
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:11,004
What's wrong?

267
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,774
I'm sorry, Matt really,
it's just,

268
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,176
I guess I'll just feel
a lot better

269
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:17,613
when we get rid of your
brother in L.A.

270
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:21,716
Shit, I'm sorry, no really,

271
00:17:21,718 --> 00:17:23,888
please don't take this
the wrong way.

272
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:30,090
No, it's... it's fine.

273
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,659
I totally understand,
you know,

274
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:36,664
and in a few hours
we'll be on earth again.

275
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,632
Yeah.

276
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,169
Thank you.

277
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:44,174
I'll go get some rest.

278
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:03,824
Look,
I can see the sun again.

279
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:05,158
You're right.

280
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,929
How's that possible?

281
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,831
We're chasing the sunset

282
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,867
'cause we're heading west.

283
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:15,770
Man, this is one fast
airplane.

284
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:17,705
I think I'ma take
flying lessons too.

285
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:19,709
Odin.

286
00:18:20,743 --> 00:18:22,810
Isn't that the name of a god?

287
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:24,978
It is.
It's the name

288
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,681
of a powerful
African god, actually.

289
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:30,650
God I agree, but African?

290
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,186
I thought he was European.

291
00:18:32,188 --> 00:18:34,088
No, no, no,
it's African.

292
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,157
I know it for sure.
My parents told me.

293
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,325
No, now I remember.

294
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:41,361
Odin is a major god
in Norse mythology.

295
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:42,698
He's Swedish.

296
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:46,199
What?
Swedish?

297
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,604
You mean like those
blonde guys?

298
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:52,907
Okay, Lisa,
you almost got me.

299
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:56,612
Not bad, but please,
don't make fun of that.

300
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,052
No way. No, I'ma Google
that shit right now, man.

301
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:07,254
That's not even funny.

302
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:09,389
Swedish man.
He ain't Swedish.

303
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:11,658
Someone's parents
got something wrong.

304
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,260
He is not...

305
00:19:18,634 --> 00:19:20,032
What happened?

306
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,836
- Kyle.
- What's happening?

307
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:23,740
I don't know.

308
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,780
The speed and altitude
are unchanged.

309
00:19:32,782 --> 00:19:34,947
Primary navigation's
still working.

310
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:36,850
Alarm's coming from
the radar.

311
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,418
Looks like it's offline.

312
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,086
So is TCAS.

313
00:19:43,191 --> 00:19:45,859
Great, now we can't locate
other planes around us.

314
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:47,293
Whoa, wait.
But they can still

315
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,728
locate us, right?

316
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,263
I mean, before they hit us.

317
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:52,332
Right, right, it's
nothing to worry about.

318
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:55,269
Ground control,
this is FJ2244.

319
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,904
Do you copy, ground?

320
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,039
It's dead.

321
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,278
Can't even change channels.

322
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:05,014
Cell's dead too.

323
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:12,352
Mine's still working but...
there's no signal.

324
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:15,955
Same here.
What does that mean?

325
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:17,425
Well, I don't know what's
happened to the phones.

326
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:19,760
That actually seems
kinda random.

327
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:21,060
But as far as
the plane's concerned,

328
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:22,227
it might just be
a short circuit

329
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,863
in the main electric system.

330
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,800
Get back to your seats.
We're gonna land.

331
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,468
No, wait, let me check
the circuitry first.

332
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,308
If I can't locate the
problem, then we'll land.

333
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:38,846
Matt, don't you think
it's safer to set down

334
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:40,747
and figure it out
on the ground?

335
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:42,182
Well, if it's just
a short circuit,

336
00:20:42,184 --> 00:20:44,083
I can switch to secondary
immediately.

337
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:45,918
Then there is no problem.
And since navigation's

338
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,224
not affected, we're in no
immediate danger, right?

339
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:06,108
What is this TCAS
you were talking about?

340
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,974
Uh, it stands for,
uh, Traffic Alert

341
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,144
and Collision Avoidance
System.

342
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,114
<i>Every plane sends out a signal
that the other planes receive</i>

343
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:17,050
<i>letting them know when they
get too close to each other.</i>

344
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,418
That way you avoid mid-air
collisions.

345
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,222
But, we're not sending
that signal anymore.

346
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:24,792
Right, but, uh...
we should still appear

347
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:27,060
on the other planes'
radar systems, so...

348
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:30,029
Everything all right
down there?

349
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:32,397
<i>Yeah,
just removed the casing.</i>

350
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,149
Guys, take a look at this.

351
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,085
Impressive.

352
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:54,854
Looks like quite a thunder
storm going on down there.

353
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,290
Oh, and that might
explain the random failure

354
00:21:57,292 --> 00:21:59,158
of our electrical devices.

355
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,226
Really?
How's that?

356
00:22:01,228 --> 00:22:05,130
Lightning can cause a sudden
change in magnetic fields,

357
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:07,834
creating an electromagnetic
pulse,

358
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:11,874
and these can overcharge
sensitive electrical equipment.

359
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:16,176
That should do it.

360
00:22:16,178 --> 00:22:18,947
Let's hope that works.

361
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:30,522
Please, I mean no harm.

362
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:33,993
<i>Odin, get down here...
now!</i>

363
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,905
- Matt, what's going on?
- Matt? Odin?

364
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,939
<i>Move!</i>

365
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,448
Up here.

366
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,954
Kyle, go check if the
instruments are working again.

367
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,322
I switched the circuitry.

368
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:04,526
Move!

369
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:08,093
Who's this?

370
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:18,204
<i>Radar back online.</i>

371
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:19,973
<i>It looks like it's damaged.</i>

372
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,975
<i>TCAS and radio
still completely dead.</i>

373
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:25,544
What have you done to
our plane, motherfucker?

374
00:23:25,546 --> 00:23:29,314
Please, I didn't sabotage
anything, believe me.

375
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,284
How did you get
aboard?

376
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,856
I got on
right after... he landed.

377
00:23:36,024 --> 00:23:37,956
I was looking for some food

378
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,328
and then the jet was suddenly
locked from the outside

379
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,030
and soon after that,

380
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,935
you all entered
and we started.

381
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:51,204
Please,
can I introduce myself?

382
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:53,509
My name's Erik, Erik Harris.

383
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:56,509
Come on guys,
go easy on him.

384
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:58,280
Where's he gonna go?

385
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,287
Please, can I have
something to drink?

386
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,954
The air down there
is really bad.

387
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:12,524
Looking for food could not
have been the only reason

388
00:24:12,526 --> 00:24:14,295
to enter an airport area.

389
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:20,269
You were trying to board
a plane, right?

390
00:24:22,303 --> 00:24:24,936
It's true I have some
problems with the authorities

391
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:27,272
back in New York,
but, uh...

392
00:24:27,274 --> 00:24:29,442
can't you just let me go

393
00:24:29,444 --> 00:24:31,711
once we arrive
in Los Angeles, and...

394
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:33,378
you'll never see me again.

395
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,147
Look, even if
I wanted to help you,

396
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:37,183
without radio and TCAS
there's no alternative

397
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,252
to landing immediately.

398
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:41,052
Kyle,
where's the closest airport?

399
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:42,524
Should be Chicago.

400
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,224
Come on,
there is nothing wrong

401
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:48,593
with our navigation system,
is there?

402
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,463
Sorry, man,

403
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,063
looks like
you got on the wrong plane.

404
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:53,934
Haven't I seen you
before somewhere?

405
00:24:55,736 --> 00:24:58,236
Hey!

406
00:24:58,238 --> 00:24:59,705
Oh, shit!

407
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,713
What's your name, son?

408
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,389
My name's... Matt.

409
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:16,991
Matt.

410
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,158
This plane stays skybound.

411
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,096
It will not alter course,
nor altitude.

412
00:25:24,098 --> 00:25:26,197
Is that understood?

413
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:29,368
Look, since we don't know
the cause of the malfunction,

414
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,136
it'd be far too dangerous
to continue this flight.

415
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:33,004
Don't worry about it.

416
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:37,409
As long as navigation works,
everything is fine.

417
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,176
Lisa, I'm scared.

418
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,177
Sit down!
[slap

419
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:42,281
You bastard!

420
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:45,518
No!

421
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,531
Get me the first aid kit!

422
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,532
We gotta stop the bleeding
immediately.

423
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,305
Here!

424
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:10,443
I don't think the bullet
hit an organ,

425
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:12,645
but we gotta get to a hospital
as soon as possible.

426
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:15,183
I'll set a course
for Chicago right away.

427
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:18,050
Damn, this hurts.

428
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:20,656
Stay calm.
You're gonna be okay.

429
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:24,188
You lunatic.

430
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,333
Okay, Buddy.

431
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:43,107
This is for your pain.

432
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:44,476
Wait a minute.

433
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,512
How can we land without radio,

434
00:26:46,514 --> 00:26:48,146
radar and all that?

435
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,715
It's okay.

436
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:52,184
As soon as
we appear on their radar

437
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:53,820
being unreachable by radio,

438
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:56,856
ground control will withdraw
the landing permissions

439
00:26:56,858 --> 00:26:58,793
for all the other planes.

440
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,130
What's going on?

441
00:27:04,698 --> 00:27:06,566
We're not landing,
are we?

442
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:09,434
Yes, we are landing,

443
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:10,802
and you're gonna be
locked up for what you did

444
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:13,338
to my friend,
<i>hijo de puta!</i>

445
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,350
Oh, shit!

446
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:29,154
Uhh...
Matt, what's going on?

447
00:27:29,156 --> 00:27:31,724
<i>Some plane
almost crashed into us.</i>

448
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,435
Look at that.

449
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,534
They must've had us on their
radar for quite some time

450
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,137
if all those planes
are stayin' up for us.

451
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,814
I've never seen anything
like this.

452
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,915
Look, those two
just got really close.

453
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:58,818
I-is that normal?

454
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,521
Do you think it's because
of the holiday traffic?

455
00:28:02,523 --> 00:28:04,688
Kyle, God damn it,
you can't move around.

456
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,593
Get back and sit down.

457
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,226
Something's wrong here.

458
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:10,830
We should've appeared

459
00:28:10,832 --> 00:28:12,463
on that
plane's positioning system.

460
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:14,432
They must've
simply overlooked us.

461
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:15,868
It can happen in crowded
airspace like this.

462
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,904
- Kyle, come back here!
- But look...

463
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,504
they're all flying
way too close to each other.

464
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:24,643
I mean, this just doesn't look
like supervised airspace.

465
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,411
What are you trying to say?

466
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,914
I really hope
I'm wrong but...

467
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,482
what if we're not
the only ones

468
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:32,650
with malfunctioning
collision avoidance?

469
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:47,331
But that's impossible!

470
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,966
A failure
of positioning systems

471
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:52,270
on multiple planes
at the same time?

472
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,271
Maybe some of the planes
were affected

473
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,375
by the electromagnetic pulses
from the thunderstorm too.

474
00:28:57,377 --> 00:29:01,879
I mean, there aren't any
walls to pass through, right?

475
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:09,788
Oh, my God.

476
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,325
Holy shit.

477
00:29:13,327 --> 00:29:15,527
All those people.

478
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,261
Matt, I don't know
what's going on

479
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,629
but let's get
out of here now.

480
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,698
He's right, we should climb.

481
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,701
Trying to land here is nuts.

482
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:24,903
I'll set a course to
the closest airport.

483
00:29:24,905 --> 00:29:26,838
It can't be far.

484
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,772
No, wait,
that's probably where

485
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:29,940
most of the others
will be heading too.

486
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,775
We should aim farther afield.

487
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:34,214
Okay, just let me get
outta here first, all right?

488
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:52,896
So just to let everyone know,

489
00:29:52,898 --> 00:29:55,367
I've set a course
for Kansas City.

490
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:57,368
We'll be landing in an hour.

491
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,002
And there's a hospital
there too.

492
00:29:59,004 --> 00:30:00,408
Awesome.

493
00:30:02,775 --> 00:30:04,644
Try to get some rest
before we land.

494
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,382
I think your temperature's
elevated.

495
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,316
Let's see
what the news says

496
00:30:11,318 --> 00:30:12,550
about what's happening
in Chicago.

497
00:30:12,552 --> 00:30:13,788
Good idea.

498
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:22,729
Damn, there's no
signal anywhere.

499
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,399
Leave it on.
Maybe it'll come back.

500
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:30,534
Guys, I've been thinking.

501
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:33,069
What if all those planes
didn't actually want to land?

502
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,874
Like if there was an emergency
down in Chicago airport?

503
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,975
Right, like if some
terrorist just got caught.

504
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:40,878
I heard they'd shut down
the entire airport then.

505
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,746
Oh, what, and all
the positioning systems

506
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:44,883
on all the planes fail
at the same time?

507
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,818
I mean that's a bit of a
coincidence, don't you think?

508
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,419
I heard some touched us, too.

509
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:50,022
You shut the fuck up,
all right?

510
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:54,629
Kyle!

511
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:58,095
What's happening to him?

512
00:30:58,097 --> 00:30:59,664
We have to go back and land.

513
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,366
But... why?

514
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:04,903
The bullet... it must've
caused an infection.

515
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,738
If it's not removed right away

516
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,609
it could go septic,
and he could die.

517
00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:14,346
You can't land in Chicago.
It's far too dangerous.

518
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:16,447
Is there really
no other way?

519
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:18,415
No, there isn't.

520
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:20,084
But can't you take the
bullet out yourself, Lisa?

521
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,521
I mean, if we go back,
we could all die, right?

522
00:31:23,523 --> 00:31:24,755
She's right.

523
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,393
Going back would be suicide.

524
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,661
Roxy, I'm in my third
semester in medicine.

525
00:31:29,663 --> 00:31:31,362
I'm not a surgeon!

526
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,003
I'm not gonna let
my brother die.

527
00:31:40,706 --> 00:31:42,138
What do you think
you're doing?

528
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,709
I'm sorry man,
but we can't turn around.

529
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,677
You know that.

530
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,780
- Are you out of your mind?
- You want to put us all

531
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,914
- in danger?
- Can't you at least try, Lisa?

532
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:53,620
But I've never done
anything like this before.

533
00:31:59,391 --> 00:32:00,892
- Matt!
- He's my brother,

534
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:02,694
- for Christ's sake.
- Matt, Matt, calm down!

535
00:32:02,696 --> 00:32:04,161
Calm down!

536
00:32:04,163 --> 00:32:06,933
You'd do the same
in my position.

537
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:12,371
So now...
it's all down to Lisa.

538
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,706
I trust you Lisa.

539
00:32:15,708 --> 00:32:18,011
You can do it.

540
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,849
All right...

541
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:28,418
let's prepare
a space in the back.

542
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:34,057
Let's see what else we have.

543
00:32:34,059 --> 00:32:37,027
There's some bandages.
That's good.

544
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,530
And this pair of
plastic tweezers.

545
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:42,532
And alcohol sterilization.

546
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:45,770
Keep the plane still, Matt!

547
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:48,041
<i>I'm trying...
it's the weather.</i>

548
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:50,642
I hope this doesn't happen

549
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:52,175
while I'm pulling
the bullet out of his wound.

550
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:53,577
Right.

551
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,813
Okay, get to work on that.

552
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,826
Okay.

553
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:11,094
This is gonna sting
a little.

554
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:13,062
Uhh...

555
00:33:13,064 --> 00:33:15,933
I think I can see
the bullet.

556
00:33:15,935 --> 00:33:17,501
I'm gonna start now,
okay Kyle?

557
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,580
Oh, shit.

558
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:33,453
Oh, stick it in me,
will you?

559
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:37,186
Ohh!

560
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:38,590
Ohh...

561
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:43,760
Oh!

562
00:33:43,762 --> 00:33:45,628
Damn,
this thing's slippery.

563
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:53,103
Okay, got it.

564
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:54,607
Hand me the knife.

565
00:33:57,843 --> 00:33:59,943
This will close the wound.

566
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,166
Your fever's dropped.

567
00:34:28,573 --> 00:34:30,240
So how'd I do?

568
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:33,109
You're gonna be okay.

569
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:36,046
I knew you could do it.

570
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:37,981
Now you can call yourself
a real doctor.

571
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,522
Kyle...

572
00:34:46,691 --> 00:34:48,225
There hasn't
really been a chance

573
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:50,992
for me to say... thank you.

574
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:55,200
For saving my life.

575
00:34:56,568 --> 00:34:59,136
Looks like you just
returned the favor.

576
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:08,678
Lisa...

577
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,180
I want to apologize

578
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:13,816
for the way I was last year.

579
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:17,256
I was all wrong about you.
I see that now.

580
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:22,695
Funny.

581
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:27,897
For a moment there
I thought...

582
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:30,034
she's your girl.

583
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:36,740
You guys better get ready.

584
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:39,011
Be landing in a few minutes.

585
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:43,012
Matt, wait.
Don't you think it's safer

586
00:35:43,014 --> 00:35:44,781
if I sit in the co-pilot
seat for landing?

587
00:35:44,783 --> 00:35:47,182
Whoa, cowboy,
you need to get some rest.

588
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:49,352
I know, it's just...

589
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,888
given our situation,

590
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:54,357
I think it'd be safer to have
the second pilot in place

591
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:57,927
just in case anything
unexpected happened.

592
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:00,330
He's right.

593
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:03,099
I'll carry him through.

594
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:14,613
Wow...
weather is getting rougher.

595
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,682
So how's things
with you and Lisa?

596
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:20,215
What? What do you mean?

597
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:22,920
They say an old flame
never dies, right?

598
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:26,356
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?

599
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,792
Lisa's here with you.
I'm fully aware of that.

600
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:30,092
Oh, come on,
even the stowaway noticed

601
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,796
- what's going on.
- Really?

602
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:34,967
So what <i>is</i> going on, Matt?

603
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:54,850
You're being ridiculous.

604
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,752
Let's just say I would
appreciate it

605
00:36:56,754 --> 00:36:59,221
if you stay away from Lisa
for the rest of this...

606
00:36:59,223 --> 00:37:01,758
- journey.
- Matt, take a look at that.

607
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,664
That's way too warm for
this altitude, isn't it?

608
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,863
Display must be
malfunctioning as well.

609
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:09,832
Temperature's still rising.

610
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:11,767
It's now reaching 30 degrees.

611
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:14,738
Hey, can we talk?

612
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,872
I need to tell you something.
It's important.

613
00:37:16,874 --> 00:37:18,342
Odin, accompany him.

614
00:37:32,924 --> 00:37:34,725
What do you have to say?

615
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,458
I've been thinking...

616
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,796
what if something actually
has happened on the ground,

617
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:42,899
I mean something big,
like a natural disaster,

618
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:45,868
a volcanic eruption,
for example?

619
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,772
Bullshit. We would've
seen that in Chicago.

620
00:37:48,774 --> 00:37:51,373
Temperature
now at 60 degrees.

621
00:37:51,375 --> 00:37:53,208
What the fuck?
This is the middle of winter

622
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,043
and we're still miles
above the ground.

623
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:57,179
- It must be a malfunction.
- What if it's not?

624
00:37:57,181 --> 00:37:59,914
What if it's not such
a good idea to land here?

625
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:01,416
Oh, no man,
not a second time.

626
00:38:01,418 --> 00:38:03,119
I am gonna land this plane
right now,

627
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:04,487
no matter what.

628
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,756
Whatever is wrong
on the ground...

629
00:38:06,758 --> 00:38:08,825
what if we're actually
flying closer to it

630
00:38:08,827 --> 00:38:10,996
instead of away from it?

631
00:38:14,132 --> 00:38:15,965
100 degrees and rising?

632
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:21,336
Matt...

633
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:23,338
I think Erik
might have a point.

634
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,808
Maybe we should climb.

635
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,175
Matt!

636
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:29,447
Matt, let's climb!

637
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:32,280
Matt!

638
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:33,885
I'm taking over.

639
00:38:38,556 --> 00:38:40,356
What the hell was that thing?

640
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:42,123
What's happening?

641
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,458
- Aren't we landing?
- That much light

642
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,561
can only come from
an explosion

643
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:48,832
or forest fires...

644
00:38:48,834 --> 00:38:51,000
or...

645
00:38:51,002 --> 00:38:52,868
I have no fucking idea.

646
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,005
Why not some large area
natural disaster?

647
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:59,375
There are a lot of volcanoes
in the United States.

648
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:00,411
What?

649
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,215
Is that really possible?

650
00:39:06,217 --> 00:39:09,451
Look, the turbulence
is dying down.

651
00:39:09,453 --> 00:39:12,121
As soon as we get far
enough away from here,

652
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:13,922
I'm gonna land this plane
wherever I can.

653
00:39:13,924 --> 00:39:16,525
Military airport,
mall parking lot... I don't care.

654
00:39:16,527 --> 00:39:19,394
I really think
it's important

655
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:21,297
not to freak out right now.

656
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:24,266
So far as long as we've
stayed up in the air,

657
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:27,101
nothing has happened to us,
right?

658
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,570
He's right.

659
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:31,106
We need to stay calm.

660
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:33,943
After all,
we filled up for L.A. right?

661
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:36,579
So we're not gonna run
out of fuel anytime soon.

662
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,248
For all we know,
some explosion or forest fire

663
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,115
happened in Kansas City,

664
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:42,284
or maybe there was
a connection

665
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,052
with what we saw in Chicago.

666
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:46,021
But either way,
we still have enough fuel

667
00:39:46,023 --> 00:39:49,294
to get far away
from this whole area.

668
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:19,221
Where's the little ticker thing
at the bottom of the screen?

669
00:40:19,223 --> 00:40:22,194
The one with all the stock
information?

670
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:27,432
Why aren't they
reporting on... on anything?

671
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,134
But... Christmas is over,
isn't it?

672
00:40:32,136 --> 00:40:33,271
It is.

673
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:46,250
Fuck!

674
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,632
December 26th
and December 27th.

675
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:05,668
Here. Right now I guess
it's crucial to find out

676
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,536
what happened on the ground.

677
00:41:07,538 --> 00:41:11,138
And since we don't have
the net, or any televised news,

678
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,244
maybe we can find some hints
in these papers my Dad left.

679
00:41:15,246 --> 00:41:16,977
But they're from yesterday.

680
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,380
Do you think they predicted
the future?

681
00:41:19,382 --> 00:41:20,715
Maybe there have been
some weather forecasts,

682
00:41:20,717 --> 00:41:23,017
tornado warnings
or something.

683
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:24,017
Or military tests
or maneuvers

684
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:25,621
scheduled in the area.

685
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:28,324
Or a political crisis
threatening to break out.

686
00:41:28,326 --> 00:41:30,362
Good point.
Let me help you.

687
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:48,677
The fashion part?

688
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,579
Baby, we're looking
for natural disasters.

689
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,312
Not fashion disasters.

690
00:41:52,314 --> 00:41:53,648
Look at this!

691
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,084
I'm about to have
a nervous breakdown.

692
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:58,923
I need something
to calm me down.

693
00:42:37,426 --> 00:42:40,498
Matt,
take a look at this.

694
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,565
Did you guys find something?

695
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:54,144
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lamar

696
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:59,651
Lamar?
You said your name was Harris.

697
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,384
Head of a religious movement

698
00:43:04,386 --> 00:43:07,120
that believes in
the apocalypse.

699
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:10,126
His real name is Erik Lamar.

700
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:13,997
I knew I seen your face
before.

701
00:43:15,598 --> 00:43:17,632
It says the FBI's been
after him ever since

702
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:20,468
plans of an assault came to
their attention last Wednesday.

703
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,637
What?
You piece of shit.

704
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,305
Are you the reason
behind all this madness?

705
00:43:25,307 --> 00:43:27,607
I'm not.
How could I?

706
00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:32,212
Each time we try to land,
you try to stop us.

707
00:43:32,214 --> 00:43:34,750
You wanted to keep this
plane in the air at any cost.

708
00:43:34,752 --> 00:43:36,551
Why?

709
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:38,553
Is it 'cause you know
we'll die down there?

710
00:43:38,555 --> 00:43:39,822
What?

711
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:41,757
You must be out of your mind.

712
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:43,290
Did you bastards
cause an explosion

713
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:44,793
or diffuse a virus
or something?

714
00:43:44,795 --> 00:43:46,829
Is that why all those planes

715
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:49,663
didn't want to land
back in Chicago?

716
00:43:49,665 --> 00:43:51,232
You snuck aboard
because you knew

717
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:52,667
that only up here
you'd be safe.

718
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,802
No.

719
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,636
You must believe me,
I-I...

720
00:43:56,638 --> 00:44:00,241
I just wanted to make
money with that sect.

721
00:44:00,243 --> 00:44:02,310
I was good at talking
and my followers,

722
00:44:02,312 --> 00:44:04,712
they kept donating...

723
00:44:04,714 --> 00:44:06,513
and I myself never believed

724
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:08,549
in that apocalypse bullshit
at all.

725
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:12,520
And... we never planned
any attack.

726
00:44:12,522 --> 00:44:14,122
I swear.

727
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:15,723
Oh, right,
the FBI was just mistaken

728
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:18,192
about that information.

729
00:44:18,194 --> 00:44:20,227
Yes.

730
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:22,562
No.
Actually,

731
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:25,135
it was all
a huge misunderstanding.

732
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:29,236
Some of the members
got it all wrong

733
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:31,471
and they started
trash talking online,

734
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:36,145
and the FBI was monitoring it.

735
00:44:40,415 --> 00:44:43,350
There! Guys, I have to
tell you something.

736
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:47,187
A moment ago I saw Lamar
checking his watch

737
00:44:47,189 --> 00:44:50,323
right before there was
a glow outside the window.

738
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:53,861
I mean, as if he knew
exactly when to expect it.

739
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:55,863
Man, you are dead.

740
00:44:55,865 --> 00:44:57,631
It's just a pulse watch.

741
00:44:57,633 --> 00:45:00,136
Please, I suffer from diabetes.

742
00:45:08,511 --> 00:45:11,279
It's true.
It's a pulse watch.

743
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:14,947
It warns me when I get
too excited, you understand?

744
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:16,584
To avoid seizures.

745
00:45:16,586 --> 00:45:18,252
That's why
I looked at it earlier.

746
00:45:18,254 --> 00:45:19,920
Oh, what a coincidence.

747
00:45:19,922 --> 00:45:21,689
It's already started.

748
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:24,958
Please,
you know about the condition.

749
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,562
Can I get some insulin
from my pack?

750
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:29,566
It's still back
in that hatch.

751
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:34,370
I can die if I don't get it.

752
00:45:35,705 --> 00:45:38,605
Right, I'll go with you.
Move!

753
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:40,510
Thank you very much.

754
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:50,787
So what do
you think of his story?

755
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:55,259
He just might
be telling the truth.

756
00:45:56,292 --> 00:45:58,662
I just don't know what
to believe.

757
00:46:03,832 --> 00:46:05,700
<i>Move!</i>

758
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:14,478
Do you think Lamar threw
this away to hide it from us?

759
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:17,745
Move it.

760
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,484
Oh, shit, listen to this.

761
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:26,319
"Former sect members claim

762
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:28,656
"that Lamar
fed them psychotropic drugs,

763
00:46:28,658 --> 00:46:30,956
"causing massive paranoia
and hallucinations

764
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:34,729
"in order to impose
his will on them.

765
00:46:34,731 --> 00:46:36,830
"Upon consumption,
people believed that they were

766
00:46:36,832 --> 00:46:39,903
actually witnessing...
the end of the world."

767
00:46:41,504 --> 00:46:43,406
Holy shit!

768
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:48,745
Give me that.

769
00:46:50,045 --> 00:46:51,879
We know all about you
and your drugs.

770
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:53,613
What?

771
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:55,582
Is this what made us
see and believe

772
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:58,952
- all those frightening things?
- Honey, what do you mean?

773
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:01,555
He gave hallucinogenic
drugs to members of his sect,

774
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:04,357
making them think that the
end of the world was near.

775
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:05,628
Look.

776
00:47:07,763 --> 00:47:09,996
Well, you must believe me,
I...

777
00:47:09,998 --> 00:47:12,767
I swear I didn't
give you anything.

778
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:15,034
It's true we experimented

779
00:47:15,036 --> 00:47:17,404
with pharmaceuticals, LSD,
stuff like that,

780
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:19,005
but I can assure you,

781
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:21,374
none of us ever
experienced anything

782
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:23,309
like we did during
this flight.

783
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,010
Then why would you hide
that page?

784
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,081
Guys,
this could be the explanation.

785
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,451
It could finally be the
explanation for everything.

786
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:33,052
I really hope you're right.

787
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:34,821
Wait, hold on.

788
00:47:34,823 --> 00:47:36,489
How is he supposed to
have given us any drugs?

789
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:38,324
Thank you.

790
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:39,759
Well, he was in
the cargo bay area

791
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:41,761
for a long time
before we found him.

792
00:47:41,763 --> 00:47:44,030
Down there it's easy to
infuse the air cycle machine

793
00:47:44,032 --> 00:47:46,634
with any sort of
foreign substance.

794
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:50,006
But just why would I
do that?

795
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,039
The air cycle machine?

796
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:55,342
Well, planes create
an artificial pressure

797
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,645
and temperature environment,
otherwise people

798
00:47:57,647 --> 00:47:59,879
wouldn't be able to survive
at such a high altitude.

799
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:02,514
Think of the whole cabin
as a giant oxygen tank

800
00:48:02,516 --> 00:48:03,949
we all breathe from.

801
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,819
It's true.

802
00:48:05,821 --> 00:48:07,721
I read about similar
experiments

803
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:09,456
with hallucinogenic drugs
on airplanes.

804
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,124
I heard enough.

805
00:48:11,126 --> 00:48:13,425
Hey, what are you doing
with that?

806
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,796
- I need those!
- Odin, what are you doing?

807
00:48:15,798 --> 00:48:18,765
So much for your goddamn
drugs, you piece of shit.

808
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:29,508
You just signed
my death warrant.

809
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,976
Are you out of your mind?

810
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:33,079
Don't worry Kyle,
he won't die.

811
00:48:33,081 --> 00:48:34,881
What Matt described
makes perfect sense.

812
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:37,516
These must have been
the drugs we read about.

813
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,552
Just how can you be sure
of that?

814
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:40,821
You might have killed
the man.

815
00:48:40,823 --> 00:48:42,958
<i>He</i> might have killed you!

816
00:48:49,931 --> 00:48:53,400
All I wanted to do was

817
00:48:53,402 --> 00:48:55,872
cross the border to Mexico.

818
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:59,474
Just cross the border.

819
00:49:01,711 --> 00:49:02,877
Hey!

820
00:49:02,879 --> 00:49:04,413
Hey.

821
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:09,484
Don't fall asleep.

822
00:49:13,088 --> 00:49:15,054
He's going into a coma.

823
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:17,657
Can't we give him some sweets
or something with sugar

824
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,726
in case he didn't lie about
his condition?

825
00:49:19,728 --> 00:49:22,664
No, not while someone's
unconscious.

826
00:49:28,003 --> 00:49:30,870
Things can't be changed
anymore.

827
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:32,572
Here's what we do.

828
00:49:32,574 --> 00:49:35,074
We exchange our cabin air,
now,

829
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:39,179
before we try to land under the
possible influence of drugs.

830
00:49:39,181 --> 00:49:41,848
To be on the safe side.

831
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,083
Exchange the air.
That's it, man.

832
00:49:44,085 --> 00:49:45,852
We'd have to release
the cabin pressure

833
00:49:45,854 --> 00:49:50,657
and open the emergency
exit at the same time.

834
00:49:50,659 --> 00:49:52,791
We'd have to descend
significantly for that.

835
00:49:52,793 --> 00:49:53,959
So?

836
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:55,895
The turbulence is gone.

837
00:49:55,897 --> 00:49:58,597
I mean, if there ever were
was any in the first place.

838
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:01,034
Kyle, you'll be the pilot.

839
00:50:01,036 --> 00:50:04,037
Odin and I will open
the emergency exit.

840
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:07,109
Everyone else...
fasten your seat belts.

841
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:16,583
All right,
ready when you are.

842
00:50:16,585 --> 00:50:18,083
Okay,
put it around your waist.

843
00:50:18,085 --> 00:50:19,885
Like this, see?

844
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:22,021
This way we won't be sucked
out or something, right?

845
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:24,523
Well, at this altitude
we won't anyway.

846
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:27,594
It'll only be windy,
very windy.

847
00:50:27,596 --> 00:50:28,960
Okay, ladies, listen up.

848
00:50:28,962 --> 00:50:31,866
Just try breathing normally,
okay?

849
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:35,635
Okay, here we go.
Kyle?

850
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:44,579
Let's bring it in.

851
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:48,113
Now!

852
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:07,570
Why is the snow... hot?

853
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:15,742
It's probably
just withdrawal symptoms.

854
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:18,078
I experienced
something similar once.

855
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:26,018
This is not snow!

856
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,089
It's ash!

857
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,635
He's dead.

858
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:44,240
What?

859
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,342
It's just like
a diabetic shock, he...

860
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:52,345
He might've been telling
the truth all along, I...

861
00:51:52,347 --> 00:51:53,813
Come.

862
00:52:27,281 --> 00:52:30,885
What... is this?

863
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:36,759
A nuclear explosion.

864
00:52:37,826 --> 00:52:40,659
But... couldn't this still be

865
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:42,764
a hallucination from the drugs?

866
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,302
No.

867
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:53,073
I don't think so.

868
00:52:55,408 --> 00:52:58,011
We're at war.

869
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,699
You think the aluminum hull

870
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,370
could protect us from
radioactivity?

871
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:26,040
I don't know.

872
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:30,241
Maybe.

873
00:53:30,243 --> 00:53:32,614
What do you mean,
radioactivity?

874
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:38,350
My cousin lives in Denver.
That's not far from here.

875
00:53:38,352 --> 00:53:41,355
I wanna land right now.
I wanna talk to her.

876
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:45,691
I said land!

877
00:53:45,693 --> 00:53:48,292
Land this plane,
God damn it!

878
00:53:48,294 --> 00:53:49,896
I wanna talk to my family.

879
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:51,997
Your cousin's dead,
Roxy!

880
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,000
Dead, along with everyone
else within hundreds of miles.

881
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:58,172
And we'll die too if we
even set foot on the ground.

882
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:01,306
How can you be sure?

883
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:03,809
You're not an expert, Matt.

884
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:06,778
How can you even be sure
it's a nuclear explosion

885
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,181
and not a hydrogen bomb
or whatever?

886
00:54:09,183 --> 00:54:11,653
That's a nuclear bomb
too.

887
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:14,753
It even explains
the random failure

888
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:16,987
of our electronic devices,
doesn't it?

889
00:54:16,989 --> 00:54:18,824
I mean, a blast like that

890
00:54:18,826 --> 00:54:20,324
sends out
electromagnetic pulses

891
00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:21,860
that could burst
sensitive equipment, right?

892
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:25,129
No chance.
We were too far away.

893
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:28,035
What if this isn't
the only one?

894
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:31,402
That green glow sure looked
like what we saw underneath

895
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:34,408
the clouds in Kansas,
and before even.

896
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:38,243
They say that in
a nuclear explosion,

897
00:54:38,245 --> 00:54:41,980
everything inflames like
paper within seconds.

898
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:45,116
For miles and miles and miles.

899
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,486
Right, but there was
nothing in flames

900
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:49,754
in Chicago, was there?

901
00:54:49,756 --> 00:54:53,225
No, but the radioactivity
could've extended there.

902
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,192
Maybe that's why no one
wanted to land.

903
00:54:55,194 --> 00:54:57,129
We're still close enough.

904
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:59,064
I'm tired of this mystery.

905
00:54:59,066 --> 00:55:03,337
I'm gonna find out what's going
on in the ground right now.

906
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:23,323
My God.

907
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:58,589
What is that?

908
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:00,591
It's my cell.

909
00:56:00,593 --> 00:56:02,863
I put it back in my bag.

910
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:15,039
<i>Hello?</i>

911
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,875
Lisa, sweetheart!

912
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:18,276
Dad!

913
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:20,010
Oh, thank God
that you're alive.

914
00:56:20,012 --> 00:56:21,044
I've been trying to reach you
for hours.

915
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:22,912
Where are you?

916
00:56:22,914 --> 00:56:26,151
I'm onboard an airplane
with some friends.

917
00:56:26,153 --> 00:56:28,587
I... We were on our way to L.A.

918
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:30,487
Dad, you have to tell us.

919
00:56:30,489 --> 00:56:32,257
<i>There's been nuclear attacks,
right?</i>

920
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:35,530
I mean, we've got almost
no information up here.

921
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,095
Yes, Lisa, there have.

922
00:56:39,097 --> 00:56:41,399
The Continental United States
was hit

923
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:44,268
by 11 nuclear missiles
in the course of the night.

924
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,339
<i>Millions of people were killed
in the explosions alone.</i>

925
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:50,106
At the moment,
everybody is trying

926
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:52,210
to escape from the radioactive
contamination.

927
00:56:52,212 --> 00:56:55,945
<i>I'll probably drive further
north in the morning myself.</i>

928
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:57,914
Dad... who...

929
00:56:57,916 --> 00:57:00,287
who did this?

930
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:06,055
What they say is that
unknown rebel forces

931
00:57:06,057 --> 00:57:08,526
have taken over a military
base in the Russian outback

932
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:10,562
from which the missiles
were launched.

933
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,997
The execution of that attack

934
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:15,999
must've been
highly professional.

935
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:18,636
<i>About an hour ago,
the Russian Government</i>

936
00:57:18,638 --> 00:57:21,339
<i>claimed they've regained
control of the facility.</i>

937
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:24,008
So... the attack is over?

938
00:57:25,144 --> 00:57:27,043
Lisa. Lisa.

939
00:57:27,045 --> 00:57:28,612
<i>Are you still there?</i>

940
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:31,081
Oh no, my battery's low.

941
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:32,651
Dad, Dad can you hear me?

942
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,084
Lisa, listen to me.

943
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:35,184
- <i>Dad...</i>
- Listen to me.

944
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:37,121
<i>You must stay in the air</i>

945
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:38,923
<i>to avoid the radiation.</i>

946
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:41,025
<i>All airplanes are advised
not to land</i>

947
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:43,428
but to fly out of
the contaminated area.

948
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:46,329
<i>Since the bombs
exploded on the ground,</i>

949
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:48,500
even a few minutes
of ground exposure

950
00:57:48,502 --> 00:57:50,602
is already said to be lethal.

951
00:57:50,604 --> 00:57:54,137
Get away from the mainland,
as far as possible.

952
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:56,106
<i>Stay skybound.</i>

953
00:57:56,108 --> 00:57:57,106
Dad?

954
00:57:57,108 --> 00:57:59,108
Stay skybound!

955
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,544
Dad?

956
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:08,220
I love you.

957
00:58:11,057 --> 00:58:12,959
Hey.

958
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:28,238
<i>So... bearing in mind
what Lisa's dad said,</i>

959
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,240
what course should we set
with our remaining fuel?

960
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,110
How far do we have to
fly away from

961
00:58:33,112 --> 00:58:35,111
let's say our major
mainland cities

962
00:58:35,113 --> 00:58:36,748
not to be affected by
radiation?

963
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,750
Great,
nobody here knows anything

964
00:58:38,752 --> 00:58:40,985
about radiation or its range.

965
00:58:40,987 --> 00:58:44,121
Without cells, radio, or at
least an internet connection,

966
00:58:44,123 --> 00:58:46,256
there's no way to find out
anything up here.

967
00:58:46,258 --> 00:58:47,591
And we can't...

968
00:58:47,593 --> 00:58:49,325
land... either!

969
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,365
Hey, isn't that entertainment
and education package

970
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:58,202
still on the hard disk
of the video system?

971
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:00,070
What?

972
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:01,974
You mean that kid's
encyclopedia?

973
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:07,645
Come on.
Don't be damaged.

974
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,347
Don't be damaged.

975
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:13,217
- Yes!
- What is that?

976
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:16,320
It's just a collection
of games and movies

977
00:59:16,322 --> 00:59:18,521
in case you get bored during
the flight... it's useless.

978
00:59:18,523 --> 00:59:20,289
Well, we just need
range information, right?

979
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,059
At least just a vague idea.

980
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:23,559
There's gotta be
some kind of entry

981
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:24,795
on the bombings of
Hiroshima or Nagasaki.

982
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:28,231
Ha. You can't be serious.

983
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:32,237
It really is for children.

984
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:42,146
All right.

985
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:44,581
"Although the explosive
forces of today's bombs

986
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:47,450
"are about seven times higher,

987
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:49,619
"the bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki

988
00:59:49,621 --> 00:59:52,424
during World War II
were devastating enough."

989
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:57,593
"Radiation never reached
the U.S.,

990
00:59:57,595 --> 00:59:59,363
"as radiation range

991
00:59:59,365 --> 01:00:02,265
"exponentially
decreases over water.

992
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:04,267
In this case,
the Pacific Ocean."

993
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:06,538
Great,
feeling smarter now?

994
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,777
You're right,
it's... useless.

995
01:00:16,115 --> 01:00:20,286
Well, this one seems to be
telling some sort of range.

996
01:00:26,224 --> 01:00:28,559
How do you know that?

997
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:31,128
I was always good at math.

998
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,630
Didn't wanna study it though.
Too boring.

999
01:00:33,632 --> 01:00:35,198
Honey, are you kidding me?

1000
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,603
Did you think I was dumb,
or what?

1001
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:41,738
So if I give you
our fuel range,

1002
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,407
can you make something
out of it?

1003
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:44,744
Well, let's see.

1004
01:00:46,144 --> 01:00:48,811
That one seems to stand
for explosive force,

1005
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:51,215
which we know is about
seven times higher now.

1006
01:00:51,217 --> 01:00:52,648
Didn't you just so, Kyle?

1007
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:55,487
Uh, yeah, I did.

1008
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:59,689
All right, tell me how much
fuel's left

1009
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:02,425
- and, uh, do we have a map?
- Yeah.

1010
01:01:02,427 --> 01:01:06,662
Okay. Bring it to me
and... a shot of something?

1011
01:01:06,664 --> 01:01:08,400
I need to wake up.

1012
01:01:57,516 --> 01:01:58,548
No, go ahead,
tear it apart.

1013
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,319
Patience.

1014
01:02:12,264 --> 01:02:15,264
Okay, so based upon
our remaining fuel,

1015
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:16,465
and assuming
that either Los Angeles

1016
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:18,401
or San Francisco were hit,

1017
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:21,572
we can't get far enough
anymore going north or south.

1018
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:23,439
And since the east is
where we're coming from,

1019
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:26,876
the only safe place we
still could reach lies west,

1020
01:02:26,878 --> 01:02:30,613
about 300 miles before
the Hawaiian Islands.

1021
01:02:30,615 --> 01:02:32,282
But that's in the water.

1022
01:02:32,284 --> 01:02:33,784
How are supposed to land there,
Roxy?

1023
01:02:33,786 --> 01:02:35,920
How should I know?

1024
01:02:37,755 --> 01:02:39,922
Can I have another one
of these, please?

1025
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:42,492
I sure wanna be drunk
when I die.

1026
01:02:44,796 --> 01:02:46,829
Is there really
nowhere else we can go?

1027
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:49,900
Nope,
contamination everywhere.

1028
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:52,203
Then we are dead.

1029
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:58,874
Only 300 miles away
from Hawaii?

1030
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:01,711
But can we make that somehow?

1031
01:03:01,713 --> 01:03:04,013
- What if we lost weight?
- Oh, forget it.

1032
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:05,749
You would never ever
gain that much more range

1033
01:03:05,751 --> 01:03:07,784
by doing that.

1034
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:09,785
Not by tossing out the
suitcases, you couldn't.

1035
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:13,523
But what if we ripped
out the entire interior?

1036
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:16,762
I mean the TVs,
the seats, everything.

1037
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:21,631
You cannot be serious.

1038
01:03:21,633 --> 01:03:23,733
What if we take
everything apart,

1039
01:03:23,735 --> 01:03:25,535
including the bathroom,
and throw it out?

1040
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:28,941
Then with a little luck,
maybe?

1041
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:35,411
Come on,
what have we got to lose?

1042
01:03:44,722 --> 01:03:45,920
Ah!

1043
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:23,827
Okay, so the computer
should automatically

1044
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:25,427
detect our new weight
and calculating

1045
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,299
if we have enough fuel
to reach Hawaii.

1046
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:31,834
So here goes.

1047
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,411
What?

1048
01:04:42,413 --> 01:04:43,780
Just 80 more miles.

1049
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:45,852
Not even a third more.

1050
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:50,386
See, I told you.

1051
01:04:50,388 --> 01:04:53,422
Oh, that's just great Kyle,
to have known that in advance.

1052
01:04:53,424 --> 01:04:55,795
That's really great
and so fucking helpful.

1053
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,661
All right, you can
shut the fuck up.

1054
01:04:58,663 --> 01:05:01,563
- Make me.
- Guys, take it easy, come on.

1055
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,699
You're so smart little bro,
you're the smartest kid I know.

1056
01:05:03,701 --> 01:05:05,134
You know what?
You can be real proud

1057
01:05:05,136 --> 01:05:06,935
of yourself Matty,
you know why?

1058
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:08,571
'Cause now we can't even

1059
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:10,406
get the news broadcasts
anymore, can we?

1060
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:12,475
Stop it, both of you!
What's gotten into you?

1061
01:05:12,477 --> 01:05:14,545
This isn't gonna help anyone.

1062
01:05:15,747 --> 01:05:17,612
Damn it!

1063
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:18,913
I'm sorry.

1064
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,638
So what else can we do?

1065
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,040
Maybe just fly north or south,

1066
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:47,576
as far as possible,
and then land?

1067
01:05:47,578 --> 01:05:49,011
After all,
Roxy's calculations

1068
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,846
might be slightly off
to our advantage.

1069
01:05:50,848 --> 01:05:52,914
Yeah,
but even if they are off,

1070
01:05:52,917 --> 01:05:55,851
one thing's for sure...
the difference between

1071
01:05:55,853 --> 01:05:57,819
how far we must travel
over ground

1072
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,955
or over water is extreme.

1073
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:01,824
We've all read
the radiation range

1074
01:06:01,826 --> 01:06:04,025
dramatically
decreases over water.

1075
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,594
So if we go north or south,

1076
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,663
we might stay within
radiation range?

1077
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:11,801
No, we will for sure.

1078
01:06:11,803 --> 01:06:13,471
Shit.

1079
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:16,705
Last year I was on
a passenger plane

1080
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:20,743
headed for Buenos Aires,
and one side's engine failed.

1081
01:06:20,745 --> 01:06:22,545
But the pilot managed
to land the plane

1082
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:24,616
as if nothing had happened.

1083
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:29,118
Even during landing, you
wouldn't have noticed a thing.

1084
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,689
All smooth.

1085
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,624
What are you saying?

1086
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:42,062
If we could remove
one of the engines,

1087
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,665
we'd probably lose
the necessary weight

1088
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,868
to make it all the way
to Hawaii.

1089
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,035
What?

1090
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:50,538
Remove one of the engines?

1091
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,544
How the hell are we
supposed to do that?

1092
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:00,748
This here is steel.

1093
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,455
That out there is only
aluminum.

1094
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:05,954
You wanna walk out
onto a wing

1095
01:07:05,956 --> 01:07:08,088
and cut off one of
the engines?

1096
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:09,757
Are you insane?

1097
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,726
Matt, that's suicide.

1098
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:14,198
He's only messing with
you anyway.

1099
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,836
I say let's try it.

1100
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:22,070
What?

1101
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:24,204
We have to at least try,
right?

1102
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,708
I mean,
even I heard of failed engines

1103
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,844
on passenger planes
that still landed safely.

1104
01:07:28,846 --> 01:07:32,748
Odin, even if we reduce our
speed as much as possible,

1105
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,518
we'd still have to stay
above 160 miles an hour,

1106
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,986
otherwise the plane just
drops out of the air.

1107
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,556
So you ever stick your hand out

1108
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:41,955
of your car going that speed?

1109
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,558
Then you might know
the feeling.

1110
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,059
But look,
the engine's mounting

1111
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:47,663
is right above the wing.

1112
01:07:47,665 --> 01:07:49,565
Just like two yards away,

1113
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:51,699
and we still got those belts
to hold Matt from the inside.

1114
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:53,166
We even have the
parachute's belts.

1115
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:55,538
All right, count me
out of this one.

1116
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,841
But I can't bro, we need
someone to level the plane

1117
01:07:58,843 --> 01:08:02,178
when the engine comes off,
to restore the balance.

1118
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,748
Whatever.

1119
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,052
I know you still
love her, Kyle.

1120
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,986
But I love her too.

1121
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,023
I guess that's just too bad,
isn't it?

1122
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:16,990
Matt, please.

1123
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,660
But either way,
little brother,

1124
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:23,598
she'll die and we'll die
if you and I

1125
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,900
don't stop fighting
and start working together.

1126
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:30,203
I know you're smart, Kyle.

1127
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:34,677
Way smarter than me.
It was always like that.

1128
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:39,748
But sometimes...
you have to take a chance.

1129
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:42,888
You must take a risk.

1130
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,824
Try the impossible.

1131
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:49,792
You know,
if we don't act now,

1132
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:52,263
we're dead already.

1133
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:57,633
This plane...
it's gonna be our tomb.

1134
01:08:57,635 --> 01:09:02,235
Either we'll crash because
we run out of fuel

1135
01:09:02,237 --> 01:09:05,275
or we're gonna land and die
from radiation eventually.

1136
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,811
Or...

1137
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,582
we can fight.

1138
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,150
Fight our way back
into the light.

1139
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,255
We can climb out of this tomb!

1140
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,055
Even if we're...

1141
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:24,225
we're scared and desperate,

1142
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:26,296
and the only way to do it
sounds insane.

1143
01:09:28,765 --> 01:09:32,936
We can't let out egos get
in the way anymore, Kyle.

1144
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,270
You and I...

1145
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:39,743
need to work together...
as brothers.

1146
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,043
Or we will die

1147
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:44,912
as individuals.

1148
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:17,979
You really think
it was such a good idea

1149
01:10:17,981 --> 01:10:19,413
to take the canvas off?

1150
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,016
What would be the point
in landing?

1151
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:24,084
Yeah, right.

1152
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:33,093
Well, it's been quite a
first date, hasn't it Lisa?

1153
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:36,064
It has.

1154
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,865
But you know...

1155
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,333
it's not over yet.

1156
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:43,971
You promised to take me home,
remember?

1157
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:47,708
Yeah, I promise.

1158
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,119
I'll wait for you to do that.

1159
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,830
Okay, speed down to 160.

1160
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:10,700
Let's do this shit.

1161
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,495
Jesus!

1162
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,213
Matt!

1163
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,823
Look,
he made it, he's hitting it!

1164
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,260
Yeah baby, whoo!

1165
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,399
There! For a moment
it was disconnected

1166
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:19,902
from the electricity.

1167
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:25,476
Come on Matt, hold on!

1168
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,486
Oh, God!

1169
01:12:42,156 --> 01:12:46,260
Hurry up guys... it has to
come off now or we'll crash.

1170
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:47,861
I can't reach the end.

1171
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:48,994
Fuck!

1172
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:55,001
I can't hold it any longer.

1173
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:19,328
No!

1174
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,274
Ah...

1175
01:13:35,276 --> 01:13:36,543
It worked!

1176
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,144
The plane's back in balance!

1177
01:13:40,281 --> 01:13:41,915
We made it!

1178
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:50,189
Where's Matt?

1179
01:14:50,084 --> 01:14:51,119
Here.

1180
01:14:52,587 --> 01:14:53,955
Thanks, Lisa.

1181
01:14:57,092 --> 01:15:00,292
Still minus 26 miles till
we reach our destination.

1182
01:15:00,294 --> 01:15:03,363
What... does that mean
we're not gonna make it?

1183
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,431
No, I think we will.

1184
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:07,667
The computer uses
an average wind speed

1185
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:11,537
for its calculations
and there's a buffer, so...

1186
01:15:11,539 --> 01:15:14,674
With a bit of luck...

1187
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,213
everything will be just fine.

1188
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,386
I'm so sorry for you, Kyle.

1189
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:26,088
About Matt.

1190
01:15:28,723 --> 01:15:31,424
He was right.

1191
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:35,729
Sometimes
you have to take a chance.

1192
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,335
He was so...

1193
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:44,436
Brave.

1194
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:54,316
You're gonna have to live
for the both of you now.

1195
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,237
The engine just shut off.
We're out of fuel.

1196
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,073
What?
How far away are we?

1197
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,011
Only a few miles.

1198
01:16:28,182 --> 01:16:29,351
We're gonna hit the water!

1199
01:16:40,661 --> 01:16:42,498
<i>Caution. The rain.</i>

1200
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:46,502
I'll try and keep
the nose up.

1201
01:17:55,503 --> 01:17:57,369
<i>Although millions
were killed</i>

1202
01:17:57,371 --> 01:17:59,538
<i>in yesterday's
disastrous attacks,</i>

1203
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,175
<i>people still keep getting out
of the contaminated areas,</i>

1204
01:18:03,177 --> 01:18:06,210
<i>reaching Mexico,
Canada, or even Hawaii.</i>

1205
01:18:06,212 --> 01:18:09,515
<i>And as the world stands
ready to help civilians</i>

1206
01:18:09,517 --> 01:18:11,215
<i>of the catastrophe,</i>

1207
01:18:11,217 --> 01:18:13,819
<i>a new beginning
will certainly come.</i>

1208
