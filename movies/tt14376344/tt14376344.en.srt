00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,351
Is anybody in here?

473
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,395
Does anybody's name in here
start with a D?

474
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,521
Andrew.

475
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,064
Yeah. Domino?

476
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:10,816
Is Lola okay? Have you seen her?

477
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,236
Yes. Yeah, she's, uh... She's cubing it up.
Are you okay?

478
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,323
Um, I'm kind of stuck in here.

479
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:20,909
What do you mean?
Do you need toilet paper?

480
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,744
I just... I got some blood on my dress.

481
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:25,539
I... It's not... I'm fine. It's not a cut.

482
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,623
Um…

483
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:27,958
Oh, word, okay.

484
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,711
Um, but I need...
Can you get me some paper towels?

485
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:31,837
Yes. Yeah.

486
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,046
Like, ten.

487
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,131
[Andrew] Yep.

488
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,465
And can you wet some?

489
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,235
- Huh?
- [Domino] Will you wet some of them?

490
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,302
Yes.

491
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,180
Okay.

492
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:46,310
Can you reach that?

493
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,812
[sobs] Fuck.

494
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,689
- What?
- I can't reach that.

495
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:53,442
I just got blood on my dre...
More blood on my dress.

496
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,712
- I can go a little further.
- Yeah, toss them. Just throw them.

497
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,590
I can but I feel like it's gonna fall
on the floor, and it's gonna be, like,

498
00:28:58,614 --> 00:28:59,615
not sanitary for your...

499
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:00,866
Go under, then. Go...

500
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:10,542
[sighs]

501
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:13,754
Close the door.

502
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,178
Are you okay?

503
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,262
Yeah.

504
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,100
Do you want me to see
if someone has a tampon or something?

505
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,936
No, I'm good. [sniffles]

506
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,939
Andrew,
I need you to help me get to my car

507
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:35,609
because I don't want the parents to think
I Kill Billed somebody in the bathroom.

508
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:38,111
Yeah, it does look like that. Do you, um…

509
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:41,198
That's a period? Uh, do you want my, um...

510
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:44,868
Do you wanna wear my coat? I have a coat.

511
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,787
I don't think your coat
is gonna cover my ass.

512
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,747
I feel like it is. I'm pretty tall.

513
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:53,502
I don't want the parents to see
me wearing some guy's jacket.

514
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:56,171
Uh.

515
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:59,049
Okay. I think I have an idea.

516
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,012
- Hey.
- I finished. Did you find my mother?

517
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,656
Great job. Yes, I did find your mother.

518
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:09,268
And she's got a bit of
a visual situation going on

519
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,937
because she spilled something
on her dress, but I have a plan.

520
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,021
What did she spill?

521
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,106
Steak.

522
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,483
She... But I... So, I have a plan.

523
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,527
My mother was not eating steak.

524
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,863
Someone else spilled steak onto her.

525
00:30:20,946 --> 00:30:22,590
But it doesn't matter
'cause I have a plan,

526
00:30:22,614 --> 00:30:25,158
and you're going to play
a super important role in that plan

527
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,035
because I can't go back into the party.

528
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:28,787
Okay.

529
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:31,582
Excuse me, David.

530
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:35,878
Your brother, Andrew, has asked me
to ask you to help me with a plan.

531
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,005
Okay.

532
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:42,509
Hello, sir.

533
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,606
Domino, I'd really like to drive
you and Lola home if that's okay.

534
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,650
And I think we should maybe
stop at the hospital.

535
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,361
[sighs, sniffles]

536
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,322
I don't need to go to the hospital.

537
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:04,406
I'm fine.

538
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,535
Okay. Well, you look totally fine, so…

539
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,915
Do you want a hug or something?

540
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,291
No.

541
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,210
{\an8}["Crime" plays]

542
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:37,940
[Andrew] Okay. I love you.

543
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,107
I love you too.

544
00:32:00,963 --> 00:32:02,172
What do you wanna do?

545
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:05,592
You want to hang out down here
while Andrew waits for a ride?

546
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,719
I want to get in my pajamas.

547
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:09,888
Okay, cutie. Do your thing.

548
00:32:10,556 --> 00:32:12,683
I'll be up in a bit to say good night.

549
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,494
Sorry I'm close to you.
You looked like you were gonna fall over.

550
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,832
I need to sit down.

551
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,097
I need to take a shower.

552
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,933
I feel like we should just sit here.

553
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:58,061
I wanna get out of this fucking T-shirt.

554
00:33:02,441 --> 00:33:03,901
I like your shirt.

555
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,656
Then why don't you marry it?

556
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,464
Domino.

557
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:27,799
Are you all right?

558
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:30,886
Yes.

559
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,306
Thank you.

00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,469
Hey.

564
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:13,594
Sorry I scared you.

565
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,806
It's okay. Where's my mother?

566
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,061
She's, um, she... I think
she's brushing her teeth too, actually.

567
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:27,234
Do you want to meet my hamster?

568
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,610
Yeah.

569
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,500
Oh, my gosh.

570
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:46,210
Here you go, Jerry.

571
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:49,089
Man, I love Jerry. He is very cute.

572
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:50,674
Good Lord.

573
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,969
So, school is starting soon.
Are you excited?

574
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:57,598
I'm excited for parts. [sighs]

575
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,932
You bummed summer is over?

576
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:00,851
A little bit, yes.

577
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,479
Do you... Do you collect potato mashers?

578
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,939
Yes, I do.

579
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,774
That's really awesome.

580
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:13,822
So, what do you usually do
before bed besides feed Jer,

581
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,158
and get in pj's and brush your teeth?

582
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:20,621
My mom sometimes will scratch my back,
but I do not want you to do that.

583
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,498
I do not let anybody
but my mother touch my back.

584
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,209
Yeah. No, that makes total sense.

585
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:29,546
Why are you here?

586
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,549
Ouch. You're trying to hurt my feelings?

587
00:35:33,217 --> 00:35:35,761
- No.
- Well, Lola, that was kind of brutal.

588
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,679
I did not mean to be brutal.

589
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:40,349
I'm just teasing.

590
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,645
Your mom just had a tough night

591
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:47,523
and I wanted to make sure
you guys were all good.

592
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,610
But I am going to leave right now.

593
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:56,490
And I'm going to see you at Lexi Ray's
bat mitzvah party, if you're going.

594
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,700
I think I will be in attendance.

595
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,118
Excellent.

596
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,579
Okay. Well, good night.

597
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:06,625
- Good night to you too, Andrew.
- And good night to you too, Jerry.

598
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,045
That's a really cute freaking hamster.

599
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:11,713
Hello.

600
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:14,424
Hey.

601
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,385
Hi. [chuckles]

602
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,428
Lola just introduced me to Jerry.

603
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,722
Oh, yeah. She's really proud of him.

604
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:24,351
Are you, um...
Are you hiding something in there?

605
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:26,103
Yes.

606
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,541
- I'm gonna go and say good night.
- Okay.

607
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:33,235
But if you wanna wait downstairs
in the living room, we can talk.

608
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:34,820
Okay.

609
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,114
I'm glad you're here.

610
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,490
I thought you left.

611
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,170
- Do you have a husband?
- I have a fiancé.

612
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,422
Joseph.

613
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:54,590
He's in Chicago.

614
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,718
He's not, um, Lola's dad, right?

615
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:58,802
No.

616
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,138
This is his parents' house.

617
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:03,182
Oh, his parents are here?

618
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:06,226
[chuckles] He inherited it.

619
00:37:14,943 --> 00:37:17,946
I feel very comfortable with you.
I don't know why.

620
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:19,865
But I do.

621
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:22,826
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?

622
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,204
Lola said you asked
about her potato mashers.

623
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:27,122
Your kid is super dope.

624
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:32,503
And I was thinking, I used to help out
families in my neighborhood,

625
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:36,673
like, if parents wanted a night out,
I would stay with their kids.

626
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,550
Or, like, even watch their house.

627
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:43,931
And I was wondering if, like, you and Lola
have a situation like that with someone.

628
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,517
- Who I need to kill.
- No.

629
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:48,852
No, I wish.

630
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,813
I'd usually just bring her
to my parents' house, but…

631
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,567
They live very far away, and it's a pain.

632
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,779
Well, if you don't want to do that ever,

633
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:03,242
call me because I really like to sit
on my ass and hang out with people.

634
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:07,996
But I understand if you don't want to,
because we don't really know each other.

635
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,083
We know each other.

636
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,502
Yeah. Right?

637
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,382
Do you have a piece of paper
somewhere in here?

638
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:25,430
Okay. My number is on this slip of paper,

639
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:30,102
and I'm gonna call a ride
so you can get some rest.

640
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:36,817
But I'd really like for you to call
or text me if you ever want a night out

641
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,235
or, like, want some help.

642
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:41,989
Okay.

643
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:45,659
You wanna sit
while you wait for your ride?

644
00:38:45,742 --> 00:38:48,245
Uh, yes. On the floor again?

645
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,290
We've upgraded.

646
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:55,836
I really like your couch.

647
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,546
I hate it.

648
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,756
Me too. That's what I meant to say.

649
00:39:03,969 --> 00:39:05,345
Are you gonna be okay tonight?

650
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:06,638
Yeah.

651
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:15,189
It wasn't a period.

652
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,276
I'm so sorry.

653
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,198
That's what I was thinking.

654
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,451
Did Joseph know that you were pregnant?

655
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,586
Let's not tell anybody about this.

656
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:38,837
Okay.

657
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:46,595
Well, if you ever want anyone to talk to,
I've got massive ears.

658
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,389
Where's your ride?

659
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:51,183
Oh, my God.

660
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,478
Probably very close.
It's about three minutes.

661
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,947
I don't... I don't feel like…

662
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,031
Okay.

663
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:14,414
I mean, I want to.
But I feel like you don't want to.

664
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,420
It's okay.

665
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:45,112
Hello, Macy. What are you doing tonight?

666
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,447
- [breathing heavily]
- [bed creaking]

667
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,617
- Are you sure nobody's here right now?
- Yeah.

668
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,953
Yeah. My, um, my parents
are at a bridge tournament.

669
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,830
- My sister's at a sleepover.
- Okay.

670
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,790
So, yeah, we can be loud.

671
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,959
Yeah. Go harder. Yeah.

672
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,669
[breathing heavily]

673
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,549
- Why... Why are you staring at me?
- I'm not.

674
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:08,111
- Close your eyes. Why are your eyes open?
- My eyes are closed.

675
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,303
They were open.

676
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:18,645
You can toss that in the bathroom.

677
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:43,587
Who are you, Mr. Fucker?

678
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:51,178
The hell are you doing
with my lover, fucker?

679
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,894
I can't believe college is over.

680
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,521
I can't believe we just had sex.

681
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,941
- Why?
- I don't know. I just feel old.

682
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:05,984
Like, I had algebra with you.

683
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:09,363
And bio. With Dr. Mindle.

684
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,614
Did you have a crush on me?

685
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:12,491
Everybody had a crush on you.

686
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:14,368
Yeah, but did you?

687
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,995
I mean, I was attracted to you.

688
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,042
But I feel like... I think I felt like
you had so many people.

689
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:24,002
A lot of suitors.

690
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:27,005
I wasn't attracted to you.

691
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,426
So I actually didn't ask that.

692
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,387
But I appreciate the honesty.

693
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,365
I was attracted to you
at my sister's bat mitzvah.

694
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,723
And now you're not?

695
00:42:36,807 --> 00:42:40,686
- Now I'm thinking about algebra.
- And bio with Dr. Mindle.

696
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,859
Do you think I peaked already?

697
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:50,487
No.

698
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,532
Of course not.

699
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:55,367
I just really hate my job.

700
00:42:56,368 --> 00:42:59,580
If only I could quit my job
and be a party starter.

701
00:42:59,663 --> 00:43:01,915
And a Meat Sticks worker.

702
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:05,002
- Mmm.
- But I actually just applied for this job.

703
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:08,797
It was a...
It's a Newark chief officer zone

704
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:13,468
opportunity analyst i-intern.

705
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:17,598
- Cool. Oh.
- I didn't get it. I got rejected.

706
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:19,975
Do you think I should quit party starting?

707
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:22,060
Well, on one hand, it is silly.

708
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,145
It's really silly.

709
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:25,564
But on the other hand, so is every job.

710
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,649
Like, selling your time is insane.

711
00:43:27,733 --> 00:43:29,735
That's really depressing.

712
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:32,321
I do think you're a sexy dancer.

713
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:35,365
No.

714
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,034
Come on.

715
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,037
- Do you wanna have sex again?
- Not at all.

716
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,580
[both laugh]

717
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:45,334
Uh, no, man.
We don't have alcohol. I wish we did.

718
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:48,545
But no, we don't have our liquor license
here in the mall.

719
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,255
Hey. How's Margaret?

720
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:51,882
Are you guys talking yet?

721
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,177
Not really.
We just text and dance at bar mitzvahs.

722
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,345
Yeah, you do.

723
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:59,473
Your chemistry with her
on the dance floor is pretty insane.

724
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:01,892
Are you just saying that?

725
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:05,145
I'm saying that 'cause I have two eyes.
You guys are electric together.

726
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:07,481
When did you have your first kiss?

727
00:44:10,067 --> 00:44:11,068
Why do you ask?

728
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:13,695
Margaret's friend told me
that she wants to kiss.

729
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:14,905
Uh-oh.

730
00:44:15,614 --> 00:44:17,407
And how do we feel about that?

731
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,326
Answer with your badass shades off.

732
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,080
I don't know how to make it happen.

733
00:44:25,249 --> 00:44:27,876
All right. Lesson one.

734
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,213
Forty percent of it is instinct.

735
00:44:31,296 --> 00:44:34,132
Like, if it feels right,
it probably is right.

736
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:35,801
Go with your gut.

737
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,971
And then 10% is your brain
and all that stuff.

738
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,014
Like game plan, strategy.

739
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:44,309
And then 50% is Margaret.

740
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:47,271
You don't know anything about her.

741
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,731
You don't know what she wants
or what she likes,

742
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:52,693
so you have to talk to her.

743
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,195
Try super hard to know.

744
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:56,947
Are there any more lessons?

745
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,031
Yes, there are.

746
00:44:58,115 --> 00:45:02,995
There are five... four lessons
on how to have the best first smooch.

747
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:11,044
[blows]

748
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:15,632
[Andrew]
Hey, do you see a lot of Lola at school?

749
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:18,218
Yeah. I have English with her this year.
Why?

750
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:21,322
I don't know. I just think you guys should
be really nice to her. Bullies suck.

751
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,433
And I feel like it'd do a lot
if cute boys were really nice to her.

752
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:27,477
That guy is a dick to us too.
He and his two friends bully everybody.

753
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:29,062
Who? Gavin?

754
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:31,899
- Yeah.
- Well, maybe you guys should beat him up.

755
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,860
I'm definitely gonna
beat Gavin's ass one day.

756
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:43,076
[burps]

757
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,661
That's bacon and eggs.

758
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,126
You're dating him, huh.

759
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:54,838
Trying to ease me into it?

760
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:57,716
Honestly, thank you.

761
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,269
You, like, training
for a big bicep contest?

762
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,522
[grunting]

763
00:46:14,024 --> 00:46:17,194
I don't want to do that anymore. [sighing]

764
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,529
You can do more.

765
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:20,989
You can do more.

766
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:24,326
Oh, no, I can't. I can't do more.
I'm not that guy.

767
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:26,620
You're not that guy, pal.

768
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:27,704
Fuck!

769
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,790
Oh, God. Oh, God.

770
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:32,543
[chuckles] I'm not a push-up guy.

771
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:34,920
[sniffs, sighs]

772
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:37,548
I'm not a sit-up guy either.

773
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:41,426
Why do you want this job?

774
00:46:42,928 --> 00:46:47,307
Well, uh, hope loves a friend.

775
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:48,892
[chuckles]

776
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:52,229
Hope Loves a Friend
is the name of our nonprofit, yeah.

777
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,566
But why do you wanna join the team
as a communications associate?

778
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:56,900
Yeah, sorry.

779
00:46:57,484 --> 00:47:00,320
I studied marketing at Tulane.

780
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:05,826
And I have, uh, a lot of experience
with social media design.

781
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:10,497
And a lot of experience with, uh,
CRM tools like Buffer and MailChimp.

782
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,708
- A lot of experience there.
- Mm-hmm.

783
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:13,791
And…

784
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,463
I don't know.
I just wanna help make a difference

785
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:22,759
with kids and young adults
whose parents are affected with ASL.

786
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,179
You mean, uh, ALS.

787
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,015
Um…

788
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,227
Pretty sure it's ASL.

789
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,857
No, I'm kidding. Obviously, you're right.

790
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,405
My dad has ALS.

791
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:47,468
That's not true.
I don't know why I just said that.

00:47:47,492 --> 00:47:49,494
[schoolchildren chattering]

793
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:56,543
- Hey.
- Hey.

794
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:58,337
How'd the interview go?

795
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:04,218
I'm going to lean back into the
Meat-Sticks, party-starting grind.

796
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:06,053
[David] Can you tell me the second lesson?

797
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,721
[Andrew] The second lesson is…

798
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,682
Give her all of your attention
because that's all people want.

799
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:12,017
[David] That's pretty easy.

800
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,644
[dance music plays]

801
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,270
Does that look good? Yes? That...

802
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:17,189
- King. You're a king.
- For the kids' side?

803
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:18,958
That's for the kids' side,
then I'll lead the adults.

804
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:21,527
Maybe we do a call and response
type of thing. So it's...

805
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,570
What if I was like… [whooshes]

806
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,906
Your turn. Or something like that?

807
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:32,287
Yes. Clap, clap. Yes! Um,
and then maybe you can invite, like, um...

808
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:35,582
Like, invite one of your friends up
to do a dance or something like that.

809
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:36,750
[David] Oh, like Carter.

810
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,878
I'm gonna be right back.
You guys keep practicing.

811
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:41,713
Nerves make you forget. Keep practicing.

812
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,549
King. Big Baller Brand.

813
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:44,925
Hey.

814
00:48:45,008 --> 00:48:46,009
Hi.

815
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,514
I'm sorry. I lost the slip of paper
that had your number on it.

816
00:48:50,597 --> 00:48:53,100
I did. And I was thinking
of calling Lisa, your mom.

817
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,228
I was, like, looking at the class list.
And then I was like,

818
00:48:56,311 --> 00:49:00,858
"I'm not gonna be like, 'Hey,
can you tell your son I lost his number?'"

819
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:02,276
[chuckles] So…

820
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:03,443
Where's Lola?

821
00:49:03,527 --> 00:49:06,488
She's actually about
to walk in with Joseph.

822
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:10,701
Um, they are parking,
and I said I had to pee really bad.

823
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,578
Oh. But you wanted to warn me?

824
00:49:12,661 --> 00:49:14,663
No, I didn't wanna warn you.

825
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:17,040
But, yeah, I did. I wanted to warn you.

826
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:18,959
He doesn't know anything
that would upset him.

827
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:22,546
Well, yeah, the theme is
"Sam goes viral. TikTok."

828
00:49:22,629 --> 00:49:24,423
- [Domino] Oh. Yeah. Hi, guys.
- Hi, Andrew.

829
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:26,925
Hey, Lola. It is so nice to see you.

830
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,594
- This is my fiancé, Jo...
- Joseph.

831
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:30,220
- Glad to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

832
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,184
Domino said you, uh,
helped out the other night.

833
00:49:32,264 --> 00:49:34,183
- I really appreciate that.
- Oh, yeah.

834
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,893
And, uh, you're our new sitter.

835
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,480
- Yes, I am. Uh-huh.
- [Joseph] Mmm.

836
00:49:40,564 --> 00:49:43,317
And you're working tonight?
I hear you're a great party starter.

837
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,113
Yeah, well, um,
I hear you're a great professional lawyer.

838
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:51,950
- A busy one. I don't know about great.
- Yeah. You out of town a lot?

839
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:55,078
Yeah.
Just a case in Chicago keeping me busy.

840
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,456
[Andrew] Is your next case in Livingston?

841
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,167
- I wish. [chuckles]
- That would be great.

842
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,085
All of his cases are in Chicago.

843
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:04,463
I think we should move there.
We're thinking about it.

844
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:06,381
[Joseph] She wants to. I'd rather not.

845
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,675
Well, where is the wedding?

846
00:50:08,759 --> 00:50:10,219
[Joseph] Here. Soon.

847
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,697
- Should we...
- [Andrew] Yeah, totally. Likewise.

848
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:14,515
[electronic dance music plays]

849

[people chattering]

850
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,945
[partygoer] Yeah!

851
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:36,203
[exhales]

852
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,121
[muffled music continues]

853
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:39,915
- Oh.
- Hi.

854
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

855
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,544
I got the sitter job?

856
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:45,546
Yes.

857
00:50:45,629 --> 00:50:47,714
I'm so sorry. I just had to... [stammers]

858
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:51,093
W-Well, no. I... I'd love to, though.
I haven't changed my mind.

859
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:54,930
Oh, okay. Well, I just thought that maybe…

860
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:58,016
What?

861
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,353
Nothing.
I have a birthday party next week,

862
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:04,898
um, that I would like to go to,
but Joseph will be out of town.

863
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:07,067
- I'm there. I'm absolutely there.
- So…

864
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,944
If Lola wants.

865
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:11,280
Yeah. Of course, she does.
She really likes you.

866
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:12,781
I really like her.

867
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,784
[game tiles clacking]

868
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:20,539
- I cannot see.
- That's the point. [chuckles]

869
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:26,211
How are you so fast at this game?

870
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,046
A lot of practice.

871
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,215
[gasps, whispers] Yes.

872
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:32,342
What is happening? What are you doing?

873
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,386
No, we are not done.

874
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:36,471
No! No!

875
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:41,977
What is "farctate"? What is "farctate"?
That is not a word. "Farctate"?

876
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,395
It is a word.

877
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:45,647
Well, use it in a sentence.

878
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:49,401
It's a farctate board now
that I've put those letters down.

879
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:53,947
What, a fucked-up board?
Like farctate... Like you farted on it?

880
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:58,035
No. It is filled.
Farctate means to fill or stuff.

881
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:00,287
It means full, as opposed to hollow.

882
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,997
I don't believe you at all.

883
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,961
And I'm going to prove
that you are telling the truth.

884
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:09,129
That is a word.

885
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,049
I don't understand how you're so good
at this game.

886
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,886
I'm not that good.
I am just a lot better than you.

887
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:16,970
Wow.

888
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:20,182
Did you feed Jerry and brush your teeth?

889
00:52:20,265 --> 00:52:22,476
- Yes, of course.
- [Andrew] Duh.

890
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,647
Well, I'm sorry Mom isn't here
to scratch your back.

891
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:30,984
Is there, um... Can I, like,
read you a story or something?

892
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:34,738
Or, like, I can fall asleep on the floor
while you fall asleep.

893
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,949
I used to need my mom to read me a story.

894
00:52:37,032 --> 00:52:40,911
Then after that, she had to, like, sleep
next to me in order for me to fall asleep.

895
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:44,623
I do not like that sort of thing.
I do not mean to be brutal.

896
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:46,875
No. No, no, no. It's not.

897
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:49,336
I just wanna make sure
you're okay to fall asleep.

898
00:52:49,419 --> 00:52:51,213
I'm okay to fall asleep.

899
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:52,881
Okay. [inhales deeply]

900
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:55,384
Um, well, good night.

901
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:56,802
Good night to you too, Andrew.

902
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,887
And good night to you too, Jerry.

903
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,556
Is mine blue?

904
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,808
[laughs] Yeah, it's super blue.

905
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:04,768
- [Domino laughs]
- How did that happen?

906
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:05,978
Just normal.

907
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:08,897
Do you want to know something?

908
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,816
- Yes.
- [crunching]

909
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:13,902
I'm having more fun now
than I did the whole night.

910
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,363
Did you have a bad night?

911
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,867
[chewing] No, it wasn't bad.

912
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah, it was bad.

913
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:27,374
I'm a bad person.

914
00:53:30,252 --> 00:53:31,962
I don't think you're a bad person.

915
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:37,134
[Domino] Let's trade.

916
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:38,969
What?

917
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,471
Okay.

918
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:50,439
[crunches]

919
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,734
- I have a question.
- Hmm.

920
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,861
- Have you ever been depressed?
- Wow.

921
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:57,863
Downer alert.

922
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:01,241
You don't have to sound the downer alert.

923
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:02,826
I'm just curious.

924
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,286
I've always been depressed.

925
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:07,581
- Whoa. Downer alert.
- [laughing]

926
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,876
Before Lola was born?

927
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,837
Especially before Lola was born.

928
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:17,299
Raising her made me better.

929
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:25,265
What's it like being depressed?

930
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,143
I don't know.

931
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:32,856
It feels like…

932
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,486
like you don't remember
what better feels like.

933
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:43,534
And then you do things that you think
will make you feel better, but they don't.

934
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:45,118
They make it worse.

935
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:49,581
[inhales deeply] And the things
that I'm really scared of doing

936
00:54:49,665 --> 00:54:53,335
are probably the things
that will help me the most,

937
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,671
but I just can't do them.

938
00:55:01,677 --> 00:55:03,679
My mom is bipolar…

939
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:07,266
So she was really depressed a lot
when I was a kid.

940
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:10,644
And, I one time asked her
the same question

941
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:13,730
and she said, "Sometimes it's just easier
for people to be sad."

942
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:17,526
She tries though. Like, really tries.

943
00:55:19,945 --> 00:55:21,488
Everybody tries.

944
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:27,327
I understand that depression
makes your brain think things aren't true,

945
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:33,709
but sometimes I just wish people
like my mom would listen to, like,

946
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,961
people instead of her brain.

947
00:55:36,545 --> 00:55:38,755
And, like, good people, not shitty people.

948
00:55:42,676 --> 00:55:44,678
Do you know what you look like right now?

949
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:46,680
No.

950
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:50,058
You look like the sweetest person ever.

951
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:54,590
- Do you know what you look like right now?
- I don't want to know... I don't care.

952
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,106
I don't want to know.

953
00:55:57,316 --> 00:56:00,652
Everything feels so good right now.
I don't want it to change.

954
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,239
The only thing I would change
is that my elbows hurt.

955
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:05,365
Your elbows hurt?

956
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,868
Yeah, from leaning on them like that.

957
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:11,997
[gasps] Hmm.

958
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:14,041
Wow.

959
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:02,256
Holy crap.

What?

962
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:19,106
Hey,
David doesn't like this cereal, does...

963
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:20,399
Nope, just you.

[sighs]

965
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,738
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. What'd you do tonight?

966
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,284
I was out with some high school friends.

967
00:57:33,287 --> 00:57:35,622
Are you planning
for your Spanish adventure?

968
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:37,749
Because I am ready to help.

969
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:44,673
I think Maya is dating someone
in Barcelona.

970
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:48,969
Mmm. [sighs]

971
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:55,309
I didn't want to say this before,

972
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:58,520
and I'm not just saying this
because I'm your mother,

973
00:57:58,604 --> 00:58:01,899
but you're way too good for her
and everybody knows that.

974
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:05,319
Literally everyone I know thinks that.

975
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:06,987
Who?

976
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:08,739

[both laughing]

978
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:17,915
- It's true though. [laughs]
- Greg told you that Maya was too good...

979
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:22,085
It's true. We all know it's true.

980

- Dummies. [laughs]

[sighs]

983
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:34,598
- Hmm.
- Yes, I'm way too good for her.

00:58:34,681 --> 00:58:36,725
[both laughing]

985
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:39,561
Your memories aren't going anywhere,
by the way.

986
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,156
I'm sorry. Growing up is hard.

987
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:55,494
It's very overwhelming.
I don't know how much I have left.

988
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:56,662
I have so much, right?

989
00:58:56,745 --> 00:59:01,542
Hmm. Not... You know, not necessarily.

990
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:02,626
You…

991
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:06,713
You did a lot when you were young.

992
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,676
Sorry.

993
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:15,472
But I feel like you're way
ahead of the game.

Hey.

01:00:18,327 --> 01:00:22,581
Guys, was it extra beautiful today?

999
01:00:22,664 --> 01:00:24,374
We were just talking about that.

1000
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,002
Yeah, sometimes I really envy Judaism.

1001
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:28,086
Same.

1002
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,672
And, uh, Nicky and his family
were so sweet. Don't you think?

1003
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,842
Yes. The parents. Oh, my God.
They were literally to die for.

1004
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:37,387
[laughs] Hey, will you sit for Lola
this week so I can take Domino out?

1005
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:40,891
Yes. Lo and I get to fricking party again?

1006
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:46,396
Well, I have four fours
which puts me at, like, 195.

1007
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,775
I tried so hard to beat you.
What is your secret?

1008
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:52,319
- I do not have any secrets.
- Do you promise?

1009
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:54,112
- Yes.
- Okay.

1010
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:58,992
Well,
Lola kicks Andrew's ass one more time.

I am not exactly sure.

- Do you want some more food?
- No, thank you.

[sighs]

1015
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:17,761
Do you like spending time
with me like this?

1016
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,973
I feel like it's taking a lot out of you,

1017
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:24,560
but I want you to know that
I can just sit here and, like, not talk.

1018
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:28,814
I can chill. I can be a chiller.
I feel like I'm talking a lot.

1019
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:34,444
Sometimes it drains me a bit mentally
and physically

Okay, yeah.

I'm sorry that I'm draining.

How can I not be? How can I help that?

1024
01:01:44,162 --> 01:01:46,790
You're probably not going to be able to.

1025
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:51,211
Sometimes I just need
to recover in solitude.

1026
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:54,298
I actually enjoy being in an empty room.

1027
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:58,093
Well, I'm very jealous of that.

1028
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:00,762
Why are you jealous?

1029
01:02:03,348 --> 01:02:06,685
Because I wish I enjoyed the company
of an empty room.

1030
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:09,855
Have you ever tried to enjoy it?

1035
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:54,316
And go like that.

1036
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:56,443
- Like this?
- Yeah.

1037
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:57,528
Okay.

1038
01:02:58,153 --> 01:02:59,738
And go across.

1039
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:01,281
- Like, across your back?
- Mm-hmm.

1040

Okay.

- How was Lola tonight?

She's great. She was great.
Um, we played 500 Rummy.

I, um… [smacks lips] …took them off.

1059
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,989
They're in my shoes
because it was getting hot in here.

1060
01:04:26,658 --> 01:04:28,160
It is really hot in here.

1061
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:31,538
Yeah, it was really hot at,
like, 20 minutes ago, especially.

Be somewhere alone with her.

01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,599
Quiet. Other people around is bad news.

1087
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:35,185
So, say "Let's go somewhere quiet"?

- Don't you have multiple?
- Yes. But one's in the hamper.

I don't want to go to work
with a smelly-ass vest on.

Can you help me for a second?

1092
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:45,380
It's somewhere in this room.
Check my drawers or something.

That's where I had my first kiss.
You can, like...

1096
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:58,417
Or you could just not say anything,
grab her hand

1097
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,377
and start walking with her
and she'll be like,

1098

"Oh, my God. Are we about
to have our first kiss right now?"

- Yes. No, not if you pull it off.

1260
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:19,616
Congratulations.

1261
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,661
Yeah. So, I'm actually gonna
be taking some time off.

1262
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:25,372
We won't need a sitter anymore.

1263
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:29,376
Where's Domino right now?

1264
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,961
She's at home.

1265
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:34,756
Is she okay?

1266
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,467
Yeah, she just didn't feel like coming
to a party tonight.

1267
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,430
Why are you so fucking vague, man?

1268
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:44,224
- What?
- Is she, like, sick or what?

1269
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:48,353
Look, Mr. Schindler's looking over here
like he wants you to get back to your job.

1270
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:51,857
I'm going to let you do that.
I'm gonna go sit with Lola.

1271
01:18:56,278 --> 01:19:00,532
Could you do me a solid?
Could you pour me, like, a straight water?

1272
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,326
And by water I mean vodka.

1273
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:08,832
[door opens, closes]

1274
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,876
Stepdad Greg.

1275
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:14,671
[Greg] Hey. I just showed up
with your mom and brother.

1276
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:18,258
Well,
I didn't think you were showing up alone

1277
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:20,469
to Benjamin Schindler's bar mitzvah party.

1278
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:24,264
[Greg] I hear we're driving you home
because you Ubered. Is that right?

1279
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:26,058
That's right. Yes.

1280
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:30,145
Although I feel like all
that Uber money might be worth it

1281
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:32,731
to not smell that fish in your car.

1282
01:19:34,316 --> 01:19:36,318
- What fish?
- I have no idea.

1283
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:39,488
I assumed you had many fish in your car.

1284
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:43,033
- Did you put fish in my car?
- No, man, your car just reeks.

1285
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:45,327
All right, Andrew.

1286
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:49,248
Have a nice night
making certain people feel happy.

1287
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:51,458
Have a nice night hating your life.

1288
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:54,962
Are you drunk right now, son?

1289
01:19:55,045 --> 01:19:57,714
I am. Yes. Sir, yes, sir.

1290
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:00,592
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1291
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:03,387
Mr. Schindler wanted you to start
a while ago. Where have you been?

1292
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,306
Doping.
Tell him his kid's party's gonna be lit.

1293
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:10,269
Yeah, I'm going to tell him
his kid's party starter was doping.

1294
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,271
What? You stink.

1295
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:13,647
[whispers] Nah, you stink.

1296
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:15,816
You stink. You have a job to do right now.

1297
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:19,027
Well, Mr. Schindler's
wearing a clown costume, so.

1298
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:22,322
You start now and I'll tell him
you were just pooping. Okay?

1299
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:24,575
Okay, great.
Tell him whatever you want, Mom.

1300
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:26,368
Job.

1301
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,995
Okay, got it.

Jesus Christ.

1303
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:30,914
- [David] Hey.
- What?

1304
01:20:30,998 --> 01:20:34,626
I'm really sorry about last night.
I need advice. I'm really nervous.

1305
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:38,463
Everybody's nervous.
You got it. I got to go.

1306
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:46,513
Hello, everybody.
Are you guys ready for a circus?

1307
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:47,639
[people cheering]

1308
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,808
[Andrew]
You ready for some music? All right.

1309
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,895
I know how hard it is for some of you
to get on the dance floor,

1310
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:54,578
but the way we're going to start tonight

1311
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:57,774
is everybody is gonna do
the Cha Cha Slide.

1312
01:20:57,858 --> 01:21:00,903
Every single person. No exceptions.

1313
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:03,335
I'm literally not going to start the song

1314
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:06,158
until every single person is
on the dance floor.

1315
01:21:16,043 --> 01:21:19,463
Hey. Um, do you want to walk with me
to the water fountain

1316
01:21:19,546 --> 01:21:21,465
while everybody's dancing
to the Cha Cha Slide?

1317
01:21:21,548 --> 01:21:22,925
["Cha Cha Slide" plays]

1318
01:21:23,008 --> 01:21:24,259
[chuckles] Yeah.

1319
01:21:24,343 --> 01:21:25,928
[music continues, muffled]

1320
01:21:31,058 --> 01:21:35,020
Are we just getting water,
or should we hang out back here?

1321
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:38,732
Um, we can hang out back here.

1322
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:56,750
Um, how was your soccer game?

1323
01:21:58,126 --> 01:21:59,920
Good. We won. [chuckles]

1324
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:01,296
Congratulations.

1325
01:22:02,339 --> 01:22:05,300
I scored a goal for you. [sighs]

1326
01:22:06,593 --> 01:22:07,678
That's nice.

- [guest 2] Whose cube is that?

1328
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:15,894
Do you want to… [inhales deeply]

1329
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:17,187
Kiss? [chuckles]

1330
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:18,897
[Lola] I just got it as a gift.

1331
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:21,251
- [guest 1] Come on. Give it.
- [Lola] No.

1332
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:22,526
What are you looking at?

that come with a professional gig.

1354

Every profession has those boundaries.

Okay, but the way you put
that man to sleep, stepdad Greg.

Andrew, this isn't funny.

Mom, I'm sorry that you got slugged,

1358
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:34,890
but those kids that Rodrigo
and David were fighting are pricks.

1359
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,373
Every kid in their grade
is going to sleep very well tonight,

1360
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:40,395
knowing they got their asses kicked.
Along with that prick dad.

- Now they won't fuck with people.
- The language.

1362

Yeah. It was worth it, Mom and Greg.

1363
01:23:44,691 --> 01:23:47,611
Yeah, I've been waiting
to kick their asses for three years now.

Unbelievable.

1365

And, Greg, that was the meanest right hook
I've ever seen, my boy.

1366
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:54,243
Yeah, Greg.
I did not know you could move like that.

Well, no one hits your mother.

- Yes, it's not there.

1374

I don't know.
Maybe it's on my bedside table.

Okay.

Uh, look, I really don't want you
to drive right now.

- Where are you going?

1378
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,822
I'm going to my friend's house
because she's sick

1379
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:34,217
- and I want to go check on her.
- Why are you in such a hurry?

1380
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,952
I'm not in a hurry. You need to
put ice on that. It looks horrible.

1381
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:38,515
David, can you come upstairs with me?

1382
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:41,415
And, you guys, ice your fists.

David, come up here.

1386

I'm really sorry.
I was having a bad 24 hours.

- It's not okay, but I'm really sorry.

1388
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:02,728
- Did you have your first kiss tonight?
- No.

1389
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:04,104
You didn't? That's good.

1390
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:07,191
That's actually really, really good
because I realized something.

1391
01:25:08,025 --> 01:25:10,027
My lessons sucked.

1392
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,612
They were, like, super misleading.

1393
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:13,822
I kept telling you
that it was all about Margaret

1394
01:25:13,906 --> 01:25:15,908
and about, like,
giving her all your attention,

1395
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:19,828
but I forgot to say that you have
to pay attention to yourself too.

1396
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:24,249
It's not easy, like we were saying.
It's actually really hard.

1397
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:27,878
Because you've got to go
for what you want, too.

1398
01:25:29,129 --> 01:25:30,881
Kissing is for two people to enjoy.

1399
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:35,219
I got to go.

really awesome shit tonight.

No, I just didn't want to go to the party.

1411
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:17,177
It's not.

1412
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:19,388
I just wanted to come
and tell you something

1413
01:26:19,471 --> 01:26:22,432
'cause I feel like I'm not going
to get another chance to tell you…

1414
01:26:23,141 --> 01:26:26,770
That I feel like
you don't want to get married.

1415
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:28,355
So, I don't think that you should.

1416
01:26:30,524 --> 01:26:31,733
And I love you.

1417
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:35,320
- You don't love me.
- Yeah, I do.

1418
01:26:38,991 --> 01:26:41,451
And more than anything,
I just want you to be happy.

1419
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:46,832
I am happy.

1420
01:26:51,503 --> 01:26:55,591
When I'm with you,
I feel so… [chuckles] …alive,

1421
01:26:55,674 --> 01:26:57,426
and I feel so special.

1422
01:26:59,136 --> 01:27:00,512
But that's because it's all…

1423
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:04,349
Possibility.

1424
01:27:07,311 --> 01:27:09,146
We're not in a relationship.

1425
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:12,024
- But what if we were in a relationship?
- I don't know.

1426
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:19,072
And I don't want to know
because you are 22,

1427
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:22,534
and you deserve so much more than this.

1428
01:27:22,618 --> 01:27:24,912
You can't just decide
that you love somebody,

1429
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:27,080
and then that's that,
and everything's great.

1430
01:27:27,164 --> 01:27:28,790
- Yes, you can.
- No, you can't.

1431
01:27:28,874 --> 01:27:31,710
Yes, you can. You can.

1432
01:27:36,173 --> 01:27:38,550
You don't even know who you are yet.

1433
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:42,846
Giving your heart to somebody is…

1434
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:45,849
The scariest,

1435
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:47,976
most dangerous,

1436
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,314
most perplexing thing.

1437
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:56,026
What if we just kiss?
Maybe you'll change your mind.

1438
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,529
[laughs]

1439
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:00,864
No.

1440
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:06,161
I want to marry him.

1441
01:28:07,663 --> 01:28:09,581
I do. I really want to marry him,

1442
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:15,462
and I know that it doesn't seem like that
because of what I do, but I want that.

1443
01:28:15,546 --> 01:28:17,840
It's just that I'm so scared…

1444
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:18,924
[sniffs]

1445
01:28:20,384 --> 01:28:21,969
…because the first one left.

1446
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:23,846
He left me. [whimpers]

1447
01:28:29,351 --> 01:28:32,604
Marrying Joseph is the thing
that will help you the most.

1448
01:28:32,688 --> 01:28:34,022
What?

1449
01:28:34,106 --> 01:28:37,776
The other night you said that the things
that really scare you are the things

1450
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,611
that are gonna help you the most.

1451
01:28:39,695 --> 01:28:41,488
I had thought that you were...

1452
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:45,200
I thought that you were talking about me.

1453
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,621
Because I'm a-an idiot.

I'm really sorry, man.
I'm... I'm... I'm a dumb kid.

1459
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,709
I know. It's okay.

1460
01:29:39,463 --> 01:29:41,423
Thanks for looking out for Lola tonight.

1461
01:29:43,342 --> 01:29:44,927
Andrew, look at me for a second.

1462
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:47,971
Thanks for looking out for my family.

1463
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,391

- Yeah.

Mom, can you, um, can you pick me up
in Greg's car right now?

1471
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:44,611
Yeah, I'm safe.
Um, everything is just, like, a mess.

["Smartest Man" plays]

- [Mr. Ron] Andrew, this is Ashlin.

1475
01:31:11,763 --> 01:31:15,142
I've heard so many things about you.
I hear you're a…

[music continues]

- [Lisa] Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1481
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:22,417
I got off early. Can I get David?

1482
01:32:23,043 --> 01:32:24,253
Yeah.

1483
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:26,088
- Are your keys in here?
- [Lisa] Yeah.

1484
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,092
- [Andrew] Mother.
- Mm-hmm.

1485
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:31,969
[Andrew] Can I tell you something?

1486
01:32:32,052 --> 01:32:33,136
Mm-hmm.

1487
01:32:35,597 --> 01:32:37,724
I'm really sorry I gave you
that black eye,

1488
01:32:37,808 --> 01:32:40,686
is the first thing I wanted to say.
It looks really cool, though.

1489
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,772
And I also want to tell you

1490
01:32:43,856 --> 01:32:46,608
that I have decided
I'm not going to Barcelona.

1491
01:32:49,319 --> 01:32:51,613
But I do think I'm gonna move out soon.

1492
01:32:53,323 --> 01:32:54,950
I realize I have enough money.

1493
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:58,537
But I don't think
I'm going to move very far.

1494
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:04,084
That sounds great, babe.

1495
01:33:08,839 --> 01:33:11,967
I've been passing our old house
on the way to work.

1496
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:13,510
Like, I walk by it every day.

1497
01:33:14,303 --> 01:33:16,180
- You have?
- Yes.

1498
01:33:18,056 --> 01:33:20,893
And I feel really happy
every time I pass it.

1499
01:33:23,228 --> 01:33:25,147
And I just want you to know that.

1500
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:31,778
Like, I have this urge to tell you
that I had a really great childhood.

1501
01:33:32,362 --> 01:33:34,907
And I think you're a really great mother.

1502
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:37,159
I hope you know that. I think that.

1503
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:43,582
And I also really love your new house.

1504

And I'm really happy that you're happy.

- [breathes heavily] Hey.
- Hi.

1513
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:44,685
For some reason, I was afraid
I was never going to see you again.

1514
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:49,439
Well, I usually don't pick up David.
But today I got off work early, so…

1515
01:34:53,443 --> 01:34:54,611
[chuckles]

1516
01:34:57,281 --> 01:35:00,117
You really caught me
off guard the other night.

1517
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,745
I just didn't have a chance to think
about what I wanted to say to you.

1518
01:35:03,829 --> 01:35:05,038
[inhales deeply]

1519
01:35:05,956 --> 01:35:08,959
It's not just
that I'm afraid of commitment

1520
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,794
because I've been left before.

1521
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:13,881
It's because
you're deeply in love with me?

1522
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:17,176
- Yeah.
- [both chuckling]

1523
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:21,597
But what I was gonna say is that…

1524
01:35:22,681 --> 01:35:25,017
It is really hard for me

1525
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:29,938
to accept the fact that
until I leave Earth,

1526
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:35,986
I'm gonna have always been so tangled.

1527
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,576
She came when I was so young.

1528
01:35:43,410 --> 01:35:44,411
And…

1529
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:52,169
Then everything from there
was defined by her stages.

1530
01:35:53,587 --> 01:35:57,257
And then Joseph came along,
and I'm so thankful, but…

1531
01:35:58,717 --> 01:36:02,804
For the rest of my life,
everything is going to be defined by them.

1532
01:36:05,265 --> 01:36:06,475
But you,

1533
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,811
you only have you.

1534
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:14,983
And how scary but how amazing.

1535
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:19,196
You can just figure things out,

1536
01:36:19,279 --> 01:36:22,658
and you don't have to worry
about bringing another person into it.

1537
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:29,957
Yeah, um, I think you're so great.

1538
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:34,253
I'm really sorry that...

1539
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:35,587
It's okay.

1540
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:48,809
- Well, dang, this sucks.
- What does?

1541
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:51,228
You just gave me, like,
your farewell speech.

1542
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:53,939
So this means we're saying goodbye.
[chuckles]

1543
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:14,751
I should go.

1544
01:37:14,835 --> 01:37:17,379
David doesn't think that I'm parking,

1545
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:19,548
so I should get in... in the carpool line.

1546
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:22,509
Um, and I don't want to see Lola.

1547
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:25,637
I realized the other day
I probably won't see her much anymore,

1548
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:27,723
and that makes a lot of sense to me.

1549
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:30,726
Yeah, but that makes me really sad.

1550
01:37:30,809 --> 01:37:32,186
Yeah, it makes me...

1551
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:36,190
Makes me really sad too.

1552
01:37:36,273 --> 01:37:37,858
Gosh, you're really sweet.

1553
01:37:37,941 --> 01:37:40,194
No, I'm not. I just really love you guys.

1554
01:37:42,946 --> 01:37:45,032
But my memories aren't going anywhere.

1555
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:47,993
Neither will mine.

1556
01:37:50,537 --> 01:37:51,997
Neither will hers.

1557
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,418
Okay, well.

1558
01:37:58,253 --> 01:37:59,254
Bye.

1559
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:07,387
- Oh, wait. Hold on.
- Yes?

1560
01:38:07,471 --> 01:38:12,893
I was... I was gonna try
and get you this, um, card.

1561
01:38:12,976 --> 01:38:15,270
I was going to mail it and then…

1562
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:19,149
- I don't have...
- You don't have my address.

1563
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,485
No,
I don't really know anything about you.

1564
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:23,737
- [laughs, sniffs]
- But you can have it.

1565
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,072
Thank you.

1566
01:38:28,325 --> 01:38:30,494
By the way, I do think I'm a soul mate.

1567
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:34,164
But I know that Joseph is too.

1568
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:42,714
[sniffs]

1569
01:38:56,436 --> 01:38:58,188
[students shouting]

1570
01:39:16,957 --> 01:39:18,584
[cries]

1571
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:23,005
[Domino] Whoo!

1572
01:39:29,511 --> 01:39:30,721
[cries]

1573
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:43,400
[sighs]

1574
01:39:49,865 --> 01:39:50,866
[Domino] Whoo!

1575
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:57,831
Do you want to talk about it?

1576
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:03,128
No, not right now. Maybe later.
Thank you for asking.

1577
01:40:04,379 --> 01:40:06,548
Well, I'm...
I'll probably end up doing homework

1578
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:09,885
at the dining room table,
so whenever you're ready.

1579
01:40:13,597 --> 01:40:16,016
David, I want to be friends forever, okay?

1580
01:40:16,725 --> 01:40:17,726
Okay.

1581
01:40:19,228 --> 01:40:21,438
Can I tell you something sad, though?

1582
01:40:21,522 --> 01:40:24,816
I think I'm not going to be living
in your room much longer.

1583
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,237
I think it's probably time
I find my own place, right?

1584
01:40:29,363 --> 01:40:33,408
Yeah. I mean, that's probably right.
It's... It's a pretty tight space.

1585
01:40:33,492 --> 01:40:36,578
[chuckles] Yes, it is a very tight space.

1586
01:40:38,872 --> 01:40:40,707
Did you talk to Margaret today?

1587
01:40:41,834 --> 01:40:45,879
Um, yeah. We did some talking.

1588
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:53,303
What? Shut your ass up right now!
Did you have your first kiss today?

1589
01:40:54,930 --> 01:40:58,559
You had your first kiss today.
What are you talking about right now?

1590
01:40:58,642 --> 01:41:00,894
At school? Oh, my God.

1591
01:41:00,978 --> 01:41:03,438
Okay, so we're... You're...
We're getting home right now.

1592
01:41:03,522 --> 01:41:06,108
You're going to do your homework
so freaking fast,

1593
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,694
and then you're going to tell me
every single solitary detail.

1594
01:41:08,777 --> 01:41:10,937
And then we're going to break
into Greg's secret fridge

1595
01:41:10,988 --> 01:41:12,628
and pop some bottles before he gets home.

1596
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:29,464
[sighs]

1597
01:41:32,885 --> 01:41:34,052
[sighs]

1598
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:40,976
[footsteps approaching]

1599
01:41:41,059 --> 01:41:42,102
[sniffs]

1600
01:41:45,272 --> 01:41:46,481
Why do you look upset?

1601
01:41:47,274 --> 01:41:48,483
Why do you look upset?

1602
01:41:50,777 --> 01:41:52,571
- What's going on?
- [sniffs]

1603
01:41:52,654 --> 01:41:55,741
Um. [breathing heavily]

1604
01:41:55,824 --> 01:41:58,994
I think I'm a little heartbroken too.

1605
01:41:59,077 --> 01:42:01,747
- What? Margaret?
- [sighs] Uh.

1606
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:05,000
[sniffs] No, no. It's… [sniffs]

1607
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:06,668
I'm going to miss you.

1608
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:08,378
["Tools" plays]

1609
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:09,755
- [sniffs]
- Oh.

1610
01:42:20,557 --> 01:42:22,434
I'm gonna miss you too, man.

1611
01:42:22,518 --> 01:42:23,519
[David sniffs]

1612
01:42:29,775 --> 01:42:31,777
[music continues]

1613
01:42:47,376 --> 01:42:49,837
- [no audible dialogue]
- [music continues]

1613
01:42:50,305 --> 01:43:50,814
