1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,440
It was on the Planet Skaro

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,126
that my old enemy, The Master,
was finally put on trial.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,440
They say he listened calmly
as his list of evil crimes was read,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,931
and sentence passed.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,407
Then he made his last,
and I thought somewhat curious, request.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,247
He demanded that, I, The Doctor,
a rival Time Lord,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,321
should take his remains
back to our home planet, Gallifrey.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,884
It was a request
they should never have granted.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,202
A Time Lord has 73 lives,
and The Master had used all of his.

11
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,324
But rules never meant much to him.

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,521
So, I stowed his remains safely
for the voyage back.

13
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,008
Because even in death
I couldn't trust him.

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,442
There, that should do it.

15
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,727
In all my travels through space and time,

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,168
And nearing the end of my seventh life,

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,882
I was finally beginning to realise
that you could never be too careful.

18
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,071
Oh, no.

19
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,928
Come on, let's go.

20
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,051
Watch it!

21
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,809
Where are you going?

22
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
Hey, where you going?

23
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,769
Come here, man. Come back here.

24
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,965
- Wimp.
- Get outta there.

25
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,005
- We're fine, man.
- Yeah.

26
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,219
Hey, is this style OK?

27
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,261
Yeah, all right. Cool, cool!

28
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,887
- Lee, did you see that thing blow?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,601
Get down!

30
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,046
Say your prayers, Lee.

31
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,063
What was that thing?

32
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,767
Timing malfunction.

33
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,089
I'm getting you an ambulance.

34
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,926
Stop it.

35
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,130
Stop it.

36
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,726
What?

37
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,000
Here it comes. Hold in there, old guy.

38
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,445
Chang Lee will help you.

39
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,169
Hey, over here.

40
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,281
- Were you with him when it happened?
- Yeah, we were just passing.

41
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,840
Is he rich? 'Cos where we're going,
he'd better be rich. Here.

42
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,285
Hey, I'm not signing anything, Mister.

43
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,482
Sign it or we can't do nothing.
Come on, kid.

44
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,488
- What's the date?
- December, 30th.

45
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,289
1999.

46
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,650
On three. One, two, go... Three.

47
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,603
Look out, coming through.

48
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,800
Go, go, go! We're losing him!

49
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,401
Yeah, go! We don't have much time.

50
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
Two hearts?

51
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,920
One bullet went
straight through his shoulder.

52
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,367
No damage. The other two are
in his left leg.

53
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,326
Look, two hearts!

54
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,121
- What?
- As if. It's a double exposure, Curtis.

55
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,524
Let's get these bullets out, then.

56
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,565
Now, this went straight through...

57
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,765
Heart's still going like crazy.

58
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,930
- Then we'll have to bring in cardiology.
- Who's on tonight?

59
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,768
Amazing Grace.

60
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,926
I have to go.

61
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,727
Excuse me, pardon me.

62
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,641
Excuse me.

63
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
Fibrillation at 300.

64
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
- 300?
- Yes.

65
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
- No blockages showing?
- No.

66
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,000
- X-ray?
- N.G.

67
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,560
- What?
- Double exposed every time we try.

68
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,240
- Well, then, try again.
- We're getting another machine.

69
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,680
- That'll take another half-hour.
- No, no, we don't have time for that.

70
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,800
- We have got to get moving on this.
- Dr Holloway, it's Brian.

71
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,440
Yeah. Brian!

72
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,845
I'm sorry. Listen, I'm on call.
What do you expect me to do, ignore it?

73
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,926
No, look, Brian, don't say that.

74
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,128
Listen, just wait until I get home.

75
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,244
Brian?

76
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,041
Sorry.

77
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,449
- Probe.
- Probe.

78
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,166
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

79
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,488
And straight to track four.

80
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,571
Track four coming up.

81
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,407
Puccini, Madame Butterfly.

82
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,240
Whatever you're about to do, stop!

83
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,120
- Mr Smith, you're going to be all right.
- No, I'm not human. I'm not like you.

84
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,680
Nobody's like you, Mr Smith.

85
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,843
Please, I need a beryllium atomic clock.

86
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,280
This is 1999, isn't it?

87
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,805
We can't wait any longer, Grace.

88
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,848
No, I'm not human... I'm not human.

89
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,408
- I'm not human!
- It's OK, I got it.

90
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Try not to speak, Mr Smith.
We've already taken out all the bullets.

91
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,040
So, now we're going
to listen to your heart,

92
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,044
try to find out why it's so wild,
and then I'm going to fix it.

93
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,366
You'll be fine.

94
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,160
OK.

95
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,720
He's under.

96
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,521
Timing malfunction.
The Master, he's out there.

97
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,521
He's out there...

98
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,287
Scalpel.

99
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,971
I've got to stop!

100
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,121
You know,

101
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,361
somehow I don't think this man's
name is Mr Smith, do you?

102
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:17,883
You get that feeling?

103
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,520
Here we have

104
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,960
an electrophysiology being performed by
one of our senior cardiologists,

105
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Dr Holloway.

106
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,920
Who will insert a microsurgical probe
into the patient's artery.

107
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,240
Then search out the short-circuiting part

108
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,640
causing the fibrillation, and just so you
know your money is being well spent...

109
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,166
we'll blast it with lasers.

110
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,167
So, is Brian threatening to leave again?

111
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,406
- He won't.
- That's strange.

112
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,041
What?

113
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,970
Déja vu. Where am I?

114
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,090
Uh, subclavian.

115
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,242
I should be in the brachiocephalic.

116
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,101
Uh, not unless this man's a donkey.

117
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,441
Then I am lost.

118
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,886
Let me try something.

119
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,880
Massive seizure,
get that probe out of there!

120
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,687
- I'm trying!
- Picture's out!

121
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,406
- Damn it! We're dropping off fast.
- Just pull it out!

122
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,240
- Come to me.
- Get it out of there, Grace.

123
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
- No blood! I can't get it out of him.
- Grace, he's flatlining.

124
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,884
The probe snapped. It's still in him.

125
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,241
Clear!

126
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,481
Clear!

127
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,542
Clear!

128
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,721
Clear!

129
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,401
Clear!

130
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,321
Give me 300.

131
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,327
Clear!

132
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,925
Clear!

133
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,761
Clear!

134
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,361
It's no good.

135
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,921
- Time of death.
- 10:03.

136
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,521
I got lost.

137
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,565
- I wanna see his X-rays now!
- Grace!

138
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,966
This is all his stuff.

139
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,124
There is no identification there, either.

140
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,847
Tag him as a John Doe
and book him for an autopsy.

141
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,765
You want me to bring that kid in?

142
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,888
Maybe he can help us
with an identification.

143
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,362
- Doctor?
- Sure.

144
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,765
This is no double exposure.

145
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,890
- Sir?
- Hmm? Yeah. I'm up.

146
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,811
Could you just come with me, please?

147
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,087
- You're the doctor?
- Yes.

148
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,921
Yes, I am.

149
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,203
- Are you a friend of Mr Smith's?
- Yeah, is he OK?

150
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,364
Actually there were some complications,
and I'm afraid he didn't make it.

151
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,561
Sorry.

152
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,606
It's OK.

153
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,242
I'll tell his family.
Are these his things?

154
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,921
Yeah.

155
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,491
- I'll take them.
- Um...

156
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,520
Maybe we should contact
the family ourselves.

157
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,171
No, Miss, this will hit them
really hard. I'll tell them.

158
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,920
You don't know this man at all, do you?

159
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,889
- Yeah, I do.
- Then, tell me his real name.

160
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,921
I gotta go.

161
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,601
Wait!

162
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,970
Somebody stop him!

163
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,321
Shut up!

164
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,842
Bruce, please?

165
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
Hey, man. You doing anything special
New Year's Eve?

166
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,920
- Going to the costume party.
- Oh, yeah, me too. Who you going as?

167
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,002
- Wild Bill Hickok.
- All right, cool.

168
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,601
Who's that?

169
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,128
John Doe, on the toe.

170
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,760
Oh, we've got a nice autopsy booked
for you tomorrow morning, Mister.

171
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,320
Followed by a sauna
or a Swedish herbal wrap.

172
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,851
What would be your pleasure?

173
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,922
1:00 a.m. Hey!

174
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,200
It's December, 31st, 1999.

175
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,965
- Party on!
- Yee-haw!

176
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,566
Sweet dreams.

177
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,011
Hey, hey, look out.

178
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,801
It's alive.

179
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,606
It's alive, it's alive!

180
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,045
It's alive!

181
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,769
I knew it! I knew it!

182
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,444
Hey, Chad, is that you?

183
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,521
Hello?

184
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,302
Who's there?

185
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,170
Oh, my God!

186
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,761
God, no!

187
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,166
Who am I?

188
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,206
Who am I?

189
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,684
Who... am... I?

190
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,366
Dr Anderson, to emergency room four.

191
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,242
Dr Anderson, please report
to emergency room four.

192
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,041
You doing anything special New Year's Eve?

193
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,720
- Going to the costume party.
- Oh, yeah, me too.

194
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,560
- Who you going as?
- Wild Bill Hickok.

195
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,641
All right, cool.

196
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Weird.

197
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,968
I must find The Doctor.
This body won't last long.

198
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,480
I need The Doctor's body.

199
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,364
Hmm, sense of humour, no more snoring?

200
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,245
You don't need a doctor.

201
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,165
Come back to bed, honey.

202
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,970
My name is not "Honey".

203
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,289
Oh, well, what would you like me
to call you, then?

204
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,487
"Master" will do.

205
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,566
Well, come back to bed, Master.

206
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,167
Ah, Doctor,
soon I will have all your lives.

207
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,051
It wasn't the same guy.

208
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,320
Sounds like you saw
the guy who stole the body.

209
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,760
He was wearing a shroud
and a JD tag on his toe.

210
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,720
Somehow, I don't think
the second coming happens here.

211
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,883
Right, you think he's going to go
to a better hospital?

212
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,881
You know what?

213
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,889
- I'm going home.
- Hey, Pete.

214
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,324
Stop by psychiatric and pick up
some more mind-altering drugs.

215
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,881
OK, sure.

216
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,688
Listen, Curtis, can you get SFPD on this?

217
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,480
Some creep's made off
with the John Doe that died last night.

218
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,166
Ew, body snatchers.

219
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,561
...please report to administration.

220
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,287
Don't call the police just yet, Curtis.

221
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,490
Grace, can you give me some time?

222
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,007
Time.

223
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,410
Keep the stairway clear, please.

224
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,566
Time.

225
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,805
Time.

226
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,600
We don't need
to advertise our mistakes, do we?

227
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,966
What are you saying?

228
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,480
Two hearts, no wonder you got lost.

229
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Exactly.

230
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,369
Or maybe,
this really was a double exposure.

231
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,680
In either case,
I can't afford to lose you.

232
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,930
- Wait... What, what are you doing?
- What we should have done last night.

233
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,330
Am I having a bad dream here?

234
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,560
I lose a patient

235
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,600
and then I lose his body and now
you have just destroyed the only proof...

236
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
That you were careless?

237
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,480
- No, that I had no way of knowing...
- Stop!

238
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,920
A man died last night
because you lost your way.

239
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
You bet I did! You saw the X-ray,
the guy had two hearts!

240
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,640
And now without a body or without records,
no one need know he was even here.

241
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,167
- You can't do this.
- Let me take care of this, Grace.

242
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,241
No!

243
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,840
Believe me,
I know what is best for all of us.

244
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,844
But, what was he?
How can we learn from him?

245
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,680
I've got to find his body.

246
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
And I have to keep this hospital open.

247
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,241
No, no!

248
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,605
If you do this,

249
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,321
I'll quit.

250
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,721
You don't mean that.

251
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,331
Hold... Hold the elevator.

252
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,964
Puccini. We've met before.

253
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,360
Ugh, I don't think so.

254
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,442
Yes, yes, I think so. I know you.

255
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,325
You're tired of life, but afraid of dying.

256
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,251
There was music, Madame Butterfly.

257
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,320
- You were there. I saw you last night.
- It wasn't me.

258
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Ugh, I don't know who I am,
but I know that you know me.

259
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,403
- Please, go away!
- Please.

260
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,360
- You're my only hope.
- I'll call security.

261
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,520
- Do you know who I am?
- I don't care who you are!

262
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,680
Leave me alone!

263
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Oh, please, you must help me.
You're a doctor!

264
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,401
Yeah, well, my oath just expired.

265
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,601
Stand back.

266
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,251
Get out, get out!

267
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,329
It's my hearts!

268
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,201
There's something...

269
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,646
It can't be!

270
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,881
What is this?

271
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,161
What is it?

272
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,525
Please, please!

273
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,411
I have two hearts.

274
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,445
You have to get me out of here
before they kill me again.

275
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,601
Please.

276
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,481
Please, you have to help me. Drive!

277
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,121
Hey!

278
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,163
OK, OK.

279
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,048
Hey, Bruce, why the shades?

280
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,300
I had a bad night.

281
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,841
Did you want something?

282
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,040
What happened to the gunshot wound
I brought in?

283
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,406
I've got orders to move him.

284
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,201
He died.

285
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,521
Oh, yeah.

286
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,170
Well, I've got orders to move his body.

287
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,441
Where is it?

288
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,642
- His body?
- Well, haven't you heard?

289
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,007
The body's gone.

290
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,810
- Stolen.
- OK.

291
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,366
Where are his things?

292
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,688
The kid that brought him in
ran off with them.

293
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,000
The Asian child.

294
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,482
The Asian child?

295
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,611
Bruce, you're sick!

296
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,561
Thank you.

297
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,640
- Are you all right?
- Better, yes.

298
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,721
Good.

299
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,844
Now I don't have a piece of primitive
wiring in my cardiovascular system.

300
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,761
Primitive?

301
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,761
I don't believe it.

302
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,367
- He's taken all his stuff.
- Who?

303
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,164
- Brian.
- Your boyfriend?

304
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,484
Ex-boyfriend.

305
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,080
Listen, why don't you just have a seat
and open your shirt?

306
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,161
I wanna listen to your heart.

307
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,281
Hearts.

308
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,281
Plural.

309
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,801
Right.

310
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,521
Right.

311
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,970
He's taken the sofa.

312
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,926
Come on, follow me.

313
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,249
- Now I'm remembering more.
- Good.

314
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,481
Lovely view.

315
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,329
Maybe you have selective amnesia
brought on by shock.

316
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,642
Maybe, I can't remember.

317
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,040
Ah, Da Vinci, he had a cold
when he drew that.

318
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,562
- You're still fibrillating badly.
- No, I'm not.

319
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,641
Here.

320
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,283
I remember!
I was with Puccini before he died!

321
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,801
- Name dropper.
- I was, I was, I was!

322
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,041
Shh.

323
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,400
- Oh, my God.
- You see, that's no echo.

324
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,600
He died before he could finish Turandot.

325
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,640
Alfano finished it based on his notes.
It was so sad.

326
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,722
You have two hearts!

327
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,408
- Who are you?
- I was dead too long this time.

328
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,200
The anaesthetic almost
destroyed the regenerative process.

329
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,806
Yeah, right.

330
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm gonna get a syringe.

331
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,440
- I'm going to take some blood.
- No. No.

332
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,800
- I want to know what's going on here.
- Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace.

333
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,720
Don't you see? I have thirteen lives.

334
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,880
Please! OK, you're trying to tell me
that you've come back from the dead?

335
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,440
- Yes!
- No, sorry. The dead stay dead.

336
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,560
You can't turn back time.

337
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,641
Yes, you can.

338
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm not a child.
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.

339
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,806
Only children believe that crap.
I am a doctor.

340
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,525
But it was a childish dream
that made you a doctor.

341
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,370
You dreamt you could hold back death.

342
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,881
Isn't that true?

343
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,686
Don't be sad, Grace.
You'll do great things.

344
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,761
Hello?

345
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,726
Who's there?

346
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,281
The guy from the ambulance?

347
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,402
Bruce, don't scare me like that.

348
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,521
- This place is freaky enough.
- Lee?

349
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,284
Chang Lee, that's your name, isn't it?

350
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
Well, I never.

351
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,484
The TARDIS really likes you.

352
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,320
What are you talking about, Bruce?

353
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,040
I'm not Bruce.

354
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,689
It took me a minute with the talking
and the walking, but I am not Bruce.

355
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,484
I am merely inside his body.

356
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,448
Oh, yeah? So, uh, who are you, really?

357
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,210
Give me the bag.

358
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,491
Yes.

359
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,280
- Where is he?
- Who?

360
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,440
The man you stole these things from,
where is he?

361
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,960
Those are mine now, he's dead.

362
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,724
He's not dead!

363
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,130
He's stolen my body.

364
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,600
- But...
- And I will die

365
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,364
unless we bring him back here.

366
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,611
You're going to help me do that,
do you understand?

367
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,489
What's in it for me?

368
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,641
You get to live.

369
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,400
Hmm, not bad.

370
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,970
- Did these belong to...
- Brian?

371
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,246
Yep. Keep 'em.

372
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,766
Thank you.

373
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,645
How's my blood?

374
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,129
It's not blood.

375
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,800
Hmm. Perhaps if I walk in them,
stretch them a bit, they'll fit me better.

376
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,409
Good idea, let's go for a walk.

377
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,563
Maybe you're the result of
some weird genetic experiment.

378
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,280
I don't think so.

379
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,720
- You have no recollection of family...
- No.

380
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,564
No. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

381
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,840
I remember... I'm with my father,
we're lying back in the grass.

382
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,320
It's a warm Gallifreyan night.

383
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
- Gallifreyan?
- Gallifrey!

384
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,680
Yes, this must be where I live.

385
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,560
- Now, where is that?
- I've never heard of it!

386
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,926
What do you remember?

387
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,727
A meteor storm. The sky
above us was dancing with lights.

388
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,760
Purple, green, brilliant yellow! Yes!

389
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,922
- What?
- These shoes!

390
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,330
They fit perfectly. Yes.

391
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,641
Yes.

392
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,688
You know, this was all mine
until he stole it from me.

393
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,808
He should never have been
allowed to be here.

394
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,600
- You know, I was told he was dead.
- That body had died,

395
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,808
but now he's regenerated into another one.

396
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,841
My body can do this twelve times,
but he's taken most of my regenerations.

397
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,366
What did he do with them?

398
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,000
Unspeakable crimes...

399
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,320
Like what?

400
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,400
Genghis Khan?

401
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,369
- What about him?
- That was him.

402
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,604
- No way!
- Yes way.

403
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,680
Look, I'm no saint, but he is evil,

404
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,366
and he's doing it all with my body.

405
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,928
I was on the verge of stopping him
when we got here.

406
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,561
Oof.

407
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,680
What do you want, Lee?

408
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,800
What do you mean?

409
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:52,410
If you could have anything,
anything at all, what would it be?

410
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,640
I don't know. A million bucks!

411
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,484
Only a million?

412
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,640
- OK, two million.
- Think bigger.

413
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,371
- A billion dollars!
- And what would that buy you?

414
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,480
Power.

415
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,561
Power.

416
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,767
Gold dust?

417
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,488
You get the rest,
when I get my body back. Deal?

418
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,601
Deal!

419
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,121
Let me show you around.

420
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,561
Go ahead.

421
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,760
Whoa, how'd I do that?

422
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,888
I told you, the TARDIS likes you.

423
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,243
The Cloister Room.

424
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,962
- Awesome.
- Isn't it?

425
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,320
Come, let me show you.

426
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,242
Here is the Eye of Harmony,
the heart of the structure.

427
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,760
Everything gets its power from here.

428
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,569
So how can it help us find him?

429
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,120
Well, as you know, it used to belong
to me, but now it belongs to him.

430
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,886
If we can open the Eye, we will find him.

431
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,241
Cool!

432
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,242
- So, you gonna open it?
- No, you are.

433
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,525
See if you can pull this reflector
staff from its mooring.

434
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,690
- This thing?
- Mmm-hmm.

435
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,165
You can do it.

436
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,126
Yes...

437
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,721
Good.

438
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,760
Now, look into the beam of light.

439
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,323
If the TARDIS really likes you,
the Eye will open.

440
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,160
- Why don't you look?
- You pulled the staff from the stone.

441
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,281
What is it?

442
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Something's happening.

443
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,480
- Something's happening...
- OK.

444
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,099
- Something's happening.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

445
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:32,842
Oh, my God!

446
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,280
I know who I am!

447
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,280
I am The Doctor!

448
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,566
Good!

449
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,407
Now do that again.

450
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,724
Whoa, what?

451
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,160
There's the guy I took to the hospital!

452
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,241
The Doctor's past life.

453
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,808
- "Doctor"?
- That's what he calls himself.

454
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,241
"Doctor".

455
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,921
The new Doctor. He's so young. Hmm.

456
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,121
Fascinating. Ah. See that?

457
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,801
That's the retinal structure
of the human eye.

458
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,929
The Doctor is half human! No wonder.

459
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,680
What?

460
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,683
No. I saw him. The Master is here.

461
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,606
What are you talking about?

462
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,802
He's planning to take my body,
so that he will live and I will die!

463
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,051
Oh, no!

464
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,849
He has opened the Eye of Harmony.

465
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,888
What is the "Eye of Harmony"?

466
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,331
Wait. Wait.

467
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,567
There! We're seeing what he's seeing.

468
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,967
I know that woman!

469
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,360
- Ah!
- I'm closing my eyes

470
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,520
so he can't see you, Grace,
but it maybe too late.

471
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,000
What's the "Eye of Harmony"?

472
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,520
It's the power source at
the heart of the TARDIS.

473
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,640
The TARDIS? What's a TARDIS?

474
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,960
The TARDIS is my ship that carries me
through time and space.

475
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,880
T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for
Time and Relative Dimension in Space.

476
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,320
And this Master, is he like the Devil?

477
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,640
The Master is a rival Time Lord.

478
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,720
"Time Lord"? Oh, my God.

479
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,600
Pure evil. I was bringing home his
remains from Skaro,

480
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,240
where his final incarnation had exterminated
by the Daleks, or so we thought.

481
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,000
- You really are insane, aren't you?
- But he wasn't dead. It's a trap.

482
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,120
Don't you see? It's a trap.

483
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,400
He wants me to look into the Eye.
If I look into the Eye of Harmony,

484
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,240
my soul will be destroyed,
he will take my body...

485
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,280
Listen to all those lies.

486
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,400
How could she believe him?

487
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:49,120
- I don't want to deal with this.
- Grace, listen!

488
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,720
- That's enough!
- If the Eye of Harmony isn't closed,

489
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,200
this planet will be sucked through it!

490
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,400
Grace, I need to fix the timing mechanism
on the TARDIS and close the Eye.

491
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,440
I need an atomic clock.
Grace, please, help me find one.

492
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,162
Grace. Grace. Grace?

493
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,601
Grace!

494
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,120
So that's how he intends to destroy me.

495
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,880
How?

496
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,120
We must get to the Doctor
before he finds a clock.

497
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,520
I know that woman.

498
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,120
She was the surgeon
who operated on him last night.

499
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,248
Well, if you find her, we'll find him.

500
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,324
- Grace!
- You just stay away from me!

501
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,520
Oh, come on, Grace, please just let me in.

502
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:41,601
No!

503
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:46,760
Grace! Let me in. We can sit down,

504
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,440
we can have a cup of tea,
we can talk about this reasonably.

505
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,046
- Sure, Time Lord to Earthling.
- Yes, that's right. I am a Time Lord.

506
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,441
- I thought you were a doctor.
- I thought you were a doctor!

507
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,160
I am calling an ambulance to
take you back to Psychiatric

508
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,920
from which you have obviously escaped!

509
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,320
Grace, we don't have time for this.

510
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,360
The Eye of Harmony is open. If I don't
close it, get my TARDIS and the Master

511
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,160
off this planet,
this planet will no longer exist!

512
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,006
- I'm calling the ambulance.
- Grace, we have until midnight.

513
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,124
Come on, come on.

514
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,900
Yes, yes, I'll hold.

515
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,400
Grace! I shall prove to you the Eye
of Harmony is open, look at this!

516
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,481
Yes...

517
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
Ah.

518
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,729
You see, already the molecular structure
of the planet is changing.

519
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,480
I'm going to need an ambulance
as soon as possible.

520
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,720
This is Doctor Grace Holloway.

521
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,088
At first, in subtle ways,
but soon in catastrophic ways.

522
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,920
I need a bed in Psychiatric.

523
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,606
By midnight tonight,
this planet will be pulled inside out.

524
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,211
There will be nothing left.

525
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,602
I think you'd better make that two beds.

526
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,721
Doctor, Doctor. Come on,
she needs an ambulance.

527
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,160
...last night's shooting in Chinatown.

528
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,600
Police believe the murders...

529
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,641
Grace. Grace. I've lost 20 pounds.

530
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,920
Congratulations.

531
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,520
In 20 minutes? It's starting.

532
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,728
You can make a fortune
in the weight-loss business, Doctor.

533
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,440
...about the strange natural phenomena.

534
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,040
Since early this evening,
Bay Area tides have risen to levels

535
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,600
that break all records
for this time of year.

536
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,440
Flood warnings have gone out along
the Napa and Russian rivers...

537
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,520
Grace, look!

538
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,040
...and believe it or not, in Hawaii
it has even started snowing.

539
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,240
You maybe wondering what this has
to do with the millennium.

540
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,960
Scientists say that the freak conditions

541
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,045
are due to the very slight fluctuations
in the Earth's gravitational pull.

542
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,486
Fluctuations that apparently only happen
once every thousand years.

543
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,085
Here's what our cameras in Hawaii...

544
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,290
I love humans. Always seeing patterns
in things that aren't there.

545
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,520
And most fashionable San Franciscans are
going tonight to ring in the new year.

546
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,920
And of course, you'll be there, won't you?

547
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,560
Naturally. Now, didn't you say they'll
see a clock getting started?

548
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,480
That's right, and you know,
it isn't just any old clock.

549
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,800
It happens to be the most
accurate atomic clock in the world,

550
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,240
and it's right here at the Institute of
Technological Advancement and Research

551
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,280
in downtown San Francisco.
So don't go away.

552
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,361
Atomic clock.

553
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,886
...any old clock...

554
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,680
the most accurate
atomic clock in the world.

555
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,480
- That must be a beryllium clock!
- They're here.

556
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,050
Excellent! They can take us
straight to the Institute.

557
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,240
We need to go straight to the Institute of
Technological Advancement and Research.

558
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,685
Do you know where that is?

559
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,001
Of course I do.

560
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,480
What time is it now?

561
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,680
Half past ten. Don't worry, I'm on
the Board of Trustees at the Institute.

562
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,886
They'll listen to me.

563
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,040
Won't this thing go any faster?
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

564
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,160
Can't you give him a sedative?

565
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,880
Grace, why did you not say
you had access to a beryllium clock?

566
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,240
I was more concerned about
the Eye of Destruction.

567
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,880
- Harmony!
- Yes, yes.

568
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,611
And the fact that the planet will be
sucked through it at midnight.

569
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,160
I mean, face it. It's not often one has
a Time Lord in one's living room, Doctor.

570
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,651
He likes me to call him "Doctor".

571
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,400
- Well...
- You know, Freud had a name for that.

572
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,560
Transference.

573
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,640
Yes, very witty, Grace.

574
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,080
At least Freud would've
taken me seriously.

575
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,520
He'd have hung up his pipe
if he'd met you.

576
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,400
- Actually, we did meet.
- Oh, that's right. He's a Time Lord.

577
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,481
We got on very well.

578
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,320
- Did you know Madam Curie, too?
- Intimately!

579
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,562
- Did she kiss as good as me?
- As well as you.

580
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,971
Looks like a truck's
blocking all the lanes.

581
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,960
There you go...

582
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,531
This planet is about to be destroyed,
and I'm stuck in a traffic jam. Excuse me.

583
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

584
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,820
Oh, my God! What is it?

585
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,966
I can't be injured like this!

586
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,280
Come on!

587
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,087
Get it off me! Get it off me!
Get it off me!

588
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,763
Get it off me! Get it off me!

589
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,361
Hey, just keep back! Get back!

590
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,920
Stop right there, sir, ma'am.

591
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,286
Go back to your vehicle.

592
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:50,366
What? Stop! He's, er, he's British.

593
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,647
Yes, I suppose I am. Jelly Baby, Officer?

594
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,206
- Jelly Baby?
- Just take it.

595
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,843
Now, would you stand aside
before I shoot myself.

596
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,083
- Don't be a fool.
- Are you with me, Grace?

597
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,204
We don't stand a chance!

598
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,960
Would you excuse me, please?

599
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,200
Grace, I came back to life
before your eyes.

600
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,160
I held back death.

601
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,520
Look, I can't make your dream
come true forever,

602
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,682
- but I can make it come true today.
- Yo, let's go!

603
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,681
Taxis down here...

604
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,201
Give me the gun.

605
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,687
OK, give him the keys.

606
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,600
Thank you.

607
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,400
- What are we waiting for?
- The road's still blocked.

608
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,847
This is an ambulance!

609
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,521
Right.

610
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,408
- Maybe I should have kept the gun.
- What?

611
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,760
Look!

612
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,242
Doctor, look out!

613
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,091
Breathe in, Grace.

614
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,611
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worried.

615
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,360
What are you doing, Lee?

616
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,044
- This way's quicker.
- It better be.

617
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,200
Look, this is my town.
I know what I'm doing. Trust me.

618
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,281
Faster.

619
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,840
So, what's the plan, anyways?

620
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,287
We'll let him get to their clock,
then we'll get his body.

621
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,386
- I think we lost them.
- Good, hold on!

622
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,280
Hey, man, when I get all that gold,
you know what I'm going to do?

623
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,441
I don't wanna know.

624
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,320
- You kill me.
- You want me to kill you?

625
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,920
No! No, I mean you make me laugh, man.
You're a funny guy.

626
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,840
- I'm glad one of us is amused.
- Hey, look, cheer up, man.

627
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,321
You'll get your body back soon,
and then we're a team, right?

628
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,869
Yes, we're a team.

629
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,004
Not again!

630
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,801
Oh!

631
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,051
Great! I finally meet the right guy
and he's from another planet.

632
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,200
- Doctor!
- Yes?

633
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,124
I only have one life.
Could you remember that?

634
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,240
I'll try!

635
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,401
Thank you!

636
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,601
Oh, no! Doctor, look.

637
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,008
Doctor Grace Holloway and guest.

638
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,280
- There you are.
- Hello, happy new year!

639
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,080
First time being on the board of this
place has ever done me any good.

640
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,367
He must have found a back way in.
I can't see him.

641
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,160
Sorry, no one beyond this point.

642
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,040
Oh, this is Doctor Bowman from London.
They're waiting for him. Come on.

643
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,929
You'll be allowed in with everyone else.

644
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,845
I'm on the Board of Trustees.

645
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,960
Thank you very much.

646
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,451
Come on.

647
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:24,240
Welcome to the Institute of
Technological Advancement and Research.

648
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,360
After dinner, Professor Wagg
will invite you

649
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,920
to join him in celebrating
the official starting

650
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,207
of the world's most accurate timepiece,

651
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,869
the San Francisco Beryllium Atomic Clock.

652
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,800
How are we gonna get that
on the back of a bike?

653
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,480
No, no, we only
need the tiniest part of it.

654
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,240
People are starting to stare.
Why don't we just make conversation?

655
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,840
So, time travel's possible?

656
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,040
Anything's possible.

657
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,360
Why don't you have the ability to transform
yourself into another species like the...

658
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,160
Well, I do, you see, but only when I die.

659
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,080
And that rival Time Lord, The Master?

660
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,280
He's on his last life,
fighting to survive.

661
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,200
And the science has shown us
over and over,

662
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,965
in the fight for survival
there are no rules.

663
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,440
Also, Grace, if I tell you a secret,
you must promise not to tell.

664
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,600
Professor Wagg. This is Doctor Bowman.

665
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,840
He's from London. He was just going
to share a secret with us.

666
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,040
Yes. Er, Professor, is there a chance
of a closer look at the clock?

667
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,400
No!

668
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,880
No, I'm afraid that I am the only
person allowed up there.

669
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,600
Oh, can't you just
bend the rules a little?

670
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:35,720
No.

671
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,560
- Oh, but you see...
- Grace says you have a big secret.

672
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,005
What is it?

673
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,600
I'm half-human.

674
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,842
On my mother's side.

675
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,842
Very clever. Happy new year.

676
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,845
Yes, I think you must be.

677
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,240
- Champagne?
- Oh!

678
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,321
- Grace...
- Oh.

679
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,830
This is when I wish
I had my sonic screwdriver.

680
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,911
What?

681
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,520
You see? I told you it was small.

682
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,884
- What is it they say?
- Yes, they say that on my planet, too.

683
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,440
- I know you.
- You do, huh?

684
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:45,440
Gareth, answer the second question
on you mid-term exam, not the third.

685
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,720
The third may look easier,
but you'll mess it up.

686
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,800
What?

687
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,565
Remember, answer the second question.
Don't forget!

688
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,811
I won't. Now can I see
what's in your hand, sir?

689
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,601
Mmm...

690
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,121
What was that all about?

691
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,720
Ten years from now, Gareth will head the
Seismology unit of the UCLA Task Force

692
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,040
and devise a system for accurately
predicting earthquakes.

693
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,440
- You mean that, don't you?
- Of course!

694
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,960
His inventions save the human race several
times, but first he must graduate in poetry.

695
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,407
Look! There's the kid who took your stuff.

696
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,882
You see who he's with? Come on.

697
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,201
The Master?

698
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,881
You're lucky he only got your wrist.

699
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,601
- Why'd you do that?
- Liven things up. Come on!

700
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,446
Door!

701
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,640
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

702
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,960
- Yeah.
- So am I.

703
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,520
Everyone, stay calm! Remain inside!

704
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,120
Don't panic! Everything is under control.

705
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,841
You go upstairs, I'll seal the exits.

706
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,686
Doctor!

707
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,924
Here we go again.

708
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,520
So, do you know what's going happen to me?

709
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,800
You don't want to know!

710
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,800
Right. You can't not tell me!

711
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,040
- Grace.
- Oh, God.

712
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,880
Brian's gonna move in again!

713
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,000
I can't say!

714
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,240
Please?

715
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,040
The universe hangs by such a delicate
thread of coincidences.

716
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,720
It's useless to meddle with it,
unless, like me, you're a Time Lord.

717
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,000
All right.

718
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,731
So just give me few pointers.

719
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,960
- There she is.
- A police box?

720
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,360
- Key.
- Now I always leave a spare key...

721
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,440
...in a secret compartment above the door.

722
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,840
Great minds thing alike. Up you go.

723
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:35,716
It's in a cubbyhole above the P.

724
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,920
Got it. Why a police box?

725
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,960
Its cloaking device got stuck
on a previous misadventure,

726
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,280
but I like it like this.

727
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,041
Doctor.

728
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,321
I've got no brakes!

729
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,160
Oh, my.

730
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,368
- Wow!
- Do you hear that?

731
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:11,281
- Yeah.
- That's a warning. The TARDIS is dying.

732
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,166
- This is amazing.
- It's no good.

733
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,840
We don't even have enough
auxiliary power to move next door.

734
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,080
The beryllium chip, Grace.

735
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,480
- Yes, Doctor.
- Careful!

736
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,369
Yes, Doctor.

737
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,880
- This looks pretty low-tech.
- "Low-tech"?

738
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,200
Grace, this is a Type 40 TARDIS, able to
take you to any planet in the Universe

739
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,363
and to any date in that planet's
existence. Temporal physics.

740
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,480
Oh, you mean like
interdimensional transference.

741
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:40,520
That would explain the spatial
displacement we experienced

742
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,364
as we passed over the threshold.

743
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,801
Yes, if you like.

744
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,241
Yes!

745
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,440
There! The Eye is closing.

746
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,166
Now, let's see.

747
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,760
Come on. Come on.

748
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,920
- Oh, no.
- What?

749
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,920
I have a horrible feeling
we're already too late.

750
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,608
- It's 11:48. We still have eleven minutes.
- There is no context. Hold on.

751
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:15,440
What are you doing?

752
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,080
I'm setting coordinates for
one minute after midnight.

753
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,280
- Why?
- If this is true,

754
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,727
the Eye has been open too long
and there is no future.

755
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,203
I only hope... Oh, no!

756
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,960
Is this thing reliable?

757
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,720
Whatever's happening can't
be stopped by closing the Eye.

758
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,920
- Well, how come you didn't know that?
- I haven't opened the Eye before.

759
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,048
Now you tell me.

760
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,000
Grace, closing the Eye may not be enough.

761
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,880
We have to go back to
before the Eye was opened.

762
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,040
- Maybe even before we arrived.
- This is a time machine.

763
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,520
- With no power.
- What?

764
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,360
The Eye being open so long
must have drained the TARDIS.

765
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,880
- Great!
- I'm sorry.

766
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,120
You must have the power to get back.
You must!

767
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,720
- Not enough!
- What about all those glorious predictions?

768
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,840
All that knowledge about what's going to
happen to Gareth, to me, to this city?

769
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,640
That must come from somewhere. Think!

770
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

771
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,724
Are you any good at setting alarm clocks?

772
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,600
- No!
- Grace!

773
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,967
- I'll try. OK.
- Listen very carefully...

774
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,400
We pre-set the coordinates
just as I divert the power

775
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,528
from within the Eye itself
into the time rotor here.

776
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,840
- We jump-start the TARDIS?
- We jump-start the TARDIS!

777
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,920
What do I do?

778
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,128
Hit the top switch on the console there.
The top one.

779
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,763
Good. Now pass me the neutron ram.

780
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,802
Grace? Grace, the neutron ram.

781
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,040
Look, I'll show you.

782
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,764
Oh, no. Oh, not you, Grace.

783
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,806
This is no time to play
doctors and nurses.

784
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,246
It's no good talking to her.
She's possessed.

785
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,200
You. You took my things. Where are they?

786
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,360
They're not your things anymore.

787
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,240
Pretty soon, everything around here's
going to belong to the Master again.

788
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,560
"Again"?

789
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,361
What's he been telling you?

790
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,720
When he gets his body back from you,
I'm going to be rich.

791
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,747
And you believe him?

792
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,040
Why shouldn't I?

793
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,640
I suppose he neglected to mention that there
won't be any place to spend your money?

794
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,800
Which is why we have no time to waste.

795
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,245
But time to change.

796
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,880
I always dress for the occasion.

797
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,640
Well, I'm glad to see that you are aware
of the gravity of the situation.

798
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,920
I never liked this planet, Doctor.

799
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,890
Well, that's good, because
any minute now it shall cease to exist.

800
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,200
What's the time?

801
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:59,606
Time enough for me to get my body,
get out of here, and take Lee with me.

802
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,925
Lee is the son I have always yearned for.

803
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,806
Oh, please!

804
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,561
Grace.

805
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,602
Put it on him. I suspect you know how.

806
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,440
Lee, this is my TARDIS.

807
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,640
This is my Eye and I'm in my own body.

808
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,000
The Master has run out of all his lives,
now he plans to steal mine.

809
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,880
That's the truth! Look at Grace!

810
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,008
She's possessed by evil, not goodness.

811
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,086
This won't hurt, much.

812
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,800
I didn't think I would make it.

813
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,006
Hey, baby.

814
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,211
Hey, Pete!

815
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,640
My life's work.

816
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,529
Om.

817
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:11,130
Om.

818
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,560
In 700 years no one
has managed to open the Eye.

819
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,840
How did you do it?

820
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:24,083
Simple. Lee is human
and you are only half.

821
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,641
Lee, open the Eye for me, please.

822
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,560
Mr Wagg!

823
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,920
Ladies and gentlemen, in three minutes
the world will enter a new millennium,

824
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,600
and with it a new standard of accuracy

825
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,920
will come to how we measure time.

826
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,604
What do you mean, it won't start?

827
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,600
Lee, this is your last chance!

828
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,800
This is my only chance.

829
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,240
He's right, Doctor.
There's nothing for him here.

830
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,288
No family, no gangs, only death.

831
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:14,920
But with me, he gets see the Universe.

832
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,440
This is his last chance to stay alive,
and you know it.

833
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,240
What do you know of last chances?

834
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,360
More than you!

835
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,650
I have wasted all my lives
because of you, Doctor,

836
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,840
and I will be rid of you.

837
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,400
All your lives! Didn't you
tell Lee I'd stolen your lives?

838
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,560
Lee, he's lying. He's used all
his lives, now he wants mine.

839
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,883
Like I told you, this is my TARDIS,
this my body.

840
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,451
Don't believe him. Open the Eye.

841
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,046
He said it himself, Lee.
He's wasted his lives, all of them.

842
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,807
- Open the Eye.
- No!

843
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:54,921
You lied to me!

844
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,441
Lee. Lee.

845
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,809
I would never lie to you.

846
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,564
I would only protect you.

847
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,988
No!

848
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,168
How will you open the Eye now?

849
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,160
Grace, come here.

850
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:29,245
Unless I'm mistaken, in her present
state of mind, that won't work!

851
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,000
Her eyes aren't human anymore.

852
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:35,100
Watch...

853
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,368
See? Now they're human.

854
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,247
No! Grace, close your eyes!

855
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,600
Too late!

856
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,281
I'm blind!

857
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,890
Your sight will return, Grace!

858
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,727
What's happening?

859
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,651
He can't move so long as the Eye links us.

860
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,000
Remember, Grace! Remember!

861
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,560
Reroute the power!

862
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,120
In the console room, go!

863
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,000
But you'll die if I leave you!

864
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:38,880
We'll all die if you don't!
Run! Run, Grace!

865
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,602
I'm taking your lives, Doctor.

866
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,406
Run!

867
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,166
I can hear your thoughts, Doctor.

868
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,520
I can feel your memories.

869
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,126
Oh. Oh.

870
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,442
This can't be how it ends.

871
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:26,327
Stop this. Please. Stop!

872
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,721
God, please!

873
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,844
Oh, what have I done?

874
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:47,726
Thirty seconds!

875
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,926
29, 28, 27, 26, 25...

876
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,000
20, 19, 18...

877
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,848
17, 16, 15...

878
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,809
12, 11, 10...

879
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,044
And I thought surgery was difficult.

880
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,241
Nine...

881
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:34,086
Eight...

882
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,851
Rerouting the power.

883
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,761
I'm alive.

884
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,563
- Seven.
- Any minute now.

885
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,960
Six...

886
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:47,044
I'm alive. I'm alive!

887
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,050
- That's all the time we have...
- Three...

888
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,247
I am alive!

889
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,085
One!

890
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,840
We have to go back
to before the Eye was opened,

891
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,000
maybe even before we arrived!

892
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,287
Alarm clock, alarm clock,
think alarm clock!

893
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,400
"Temporal orbit"?

894
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,562
What's a "temporal orbit"?

895
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,890
She did it.

896
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,326
Your life force is dying, Master.

897
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,282
No!

898
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,571
We're in temporal orbit, Doctor.
What is it?

899
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,970
What is that?

900
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:49,369
Grace! No!

901
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,405
Grace...

902
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,840
You are my life.

903
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,280
You want dominion over the living,
yet all you do is kill!

904
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,362
Life is wasted on the living!

905
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,720
Give me your hand!

906
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,961
Never!

907
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,607
Doctor!

908
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,489
Doctor, I have your things.

909
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,447
Hello, Grace.

910
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:05,281
Well, how does it feel to hold back death?

911
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,009
Incredible. Did you see that?

912
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,807
What a sentimental old thing
this TARDIS is.

913
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:33,080
Well, congratulations. You've both been
somewhere I've never been.

914
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,960
- It's nothing to be scared of, Doctor.
- Oh, glad to hear it.

915
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,440
Did we go back far enough?

916
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,808
Either that or I'm talking to a couple
of ghosts and I don't believe in ghosts.

917
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,823
So, uh, where's the Master?

918
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,290
Indigestion.

919
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,529
So, let's see where we are.

920
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,089
There. The future.

921
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,040
Wow...

922
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,920
Look over there, on the other
side of your galaxy. That's home.

923
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,080
Gallifrey.

924
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,003
Two hundred and fifty million
light years away.

925
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:14,401
Phew.

926
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,960
That's a good ten minutes
in this old thing.

927
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,010
So, where are we?

928
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,800
December 29th.
Do you want to get off here?

929
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,800
I don't think I could
live through that again.

930
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,240
I definitely wouldn't live
through that again.

931
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,321
Reason enough.

932
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,800
That's not funny!

933
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,450
Eleven, ten...

934
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,927
Nine, eight, seven...

935
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:14,600
Six, five...

936
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,360
Four, three, two, one!

937
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,562
Have a happy new year...

938
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,840
Happy new year. Happy...
Can you believe it?

939
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,921
2000.

940
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,243
Now, that's as it should be.

941
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,921
Your things.

942
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:16,760
- My sonic screwdriver. Thank you!
- And, uh, these, too.

943
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:18,280
Please, keep them.

944
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,283
- Really?
- Yes, really.

945
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,481
I'd better go before you change your mind.

946
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,043
Lee! Next Christmas, take a vacation.

947
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,161
Just don't be here.

948
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,002
Right, thanks!

949
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,891
Thanks, Doctor!

950
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,200
See you around, Grace! Happy New Year!

951
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:46,720
There you go, interfering again.

952
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,840
Grace, something you should know...

953
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,002
- Don't tell me.
- Why not?

954
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,125
I know who I am. And that's enough.

955
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,240
I'm glad.

956
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,681
Come with me.

957
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,801
You come with me.

958
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:05,884
- Me come with you?
- Yes.

959
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,889
Me come with you?

960
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,285
It's tempting.

961
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,164
I'm going to miss you.

962
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,489
How can you miss me? I'm easy to find.
I'm the guy with two hearts, remember?

963
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,364
That's not what I meant.

964
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,242
- Thank you, Doctor.
- No, no. Thank you, Doctor!

965
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,007
Bye.

966
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:35,011
Sounds better.

967
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,925
Right, where to next?

968
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,400
Where was I?

969
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,186
Oh, no, not again!

969
01:25:03,305 --> 01:26:03,490
