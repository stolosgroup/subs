2
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,486
We shouldn't be here
when it gets dark.

3
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:12,730
Set the trap at the mouth
of the cave, please.

4
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,575
You need a doctor?

5
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:25,277
I am a doctor.

6
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:28,614
It's impressive,
don't you think?

7
00:03:28,746 --> 00:03:31,016
Vampire bats weigh
almost nothing,

8
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,586
but they can down a creature
nearly ten times their size.

9
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,894
Wow.

10
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:46,065
What are you using as bait?

11
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:47,600
You volunteering?

12
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:50,202
Leaving.

13
00:03:51,903 --> 00:03:53,072
Pay me now.

14
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,974
Before the sun goes down.

15
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,553
You throw in that bushcrafter
on your belt and we have a deal.

16
00:04:56,402 --> 00:04:57,969
Come on.

17
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,516
Move!

18
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:33,405
Should be able to
take better care of you here.

19
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:40,112
Everyone's here to help you.

20
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:45,551
Michael, this is Lucian.
Lucian, Michael.

21
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:48,153
Michael knows more
about this place than I do.

22
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:50,789
Play nice.

23
00:05:52,324 --> 00:05:53,525
Hello.

24
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,561
Hello, Milo.

25
00:05:55,694 --> 00:05:57,262
My name's Lucian.

26
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:01,266
The person
who was here before was Milo.

27
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,900
No.

28
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,237
He was also the new Milo.

29
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:07,740
And before him
was the other new Milo.

30
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:10,409
I don't even remember
the first Milo.

31
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,145
How long have you been here?

32
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:16,048
Long as I can remember.

33
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:19,051
- And you're still not cured?
- There is no cure.

34
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:22,254
There's something missing
from our DNA.

35
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:24,189
<i>Like a piece of a puzzle.</i>

36
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:27,393
<i>And until they find it,
the only way to stay alive</i>

37
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:29,795
<i>is an oil change
three times a day.</i>

38
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:37,269
What would you do
if you could be normal?

39
00:06:37,403 --> 00:06:39,338
Just for an hour?

40
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,375
I don't think about it.

41
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,178
Hey, look at the freaks!
Look at them!

42
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,486
Best not to be outside
when school gets out.

43
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,455
Like the original Spartans,

44
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:59,491
we are the few against the many.

45
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:06,832
Milo?

46
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:09,768
Milo?

47
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:11,870
Nurse?

48
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,881
Okay...

49
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:32,691
Lucian.

50
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,861
Lucian!

51
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:44,603
With one of these?

52
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:47,005
It took a team of scientists
to build that machine

53
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,341
and you fixed it
with a ballpoint pen?

54
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:58,550
There's a school
for gifted children in New York.

55
00:07:58,684 --> 00:08:02,621
I think that I could get them
to agree to cover your tuition

56
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:06,525
and provide private care
to help manage your condition.

57
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:10,496
Somewhere you could study,
learn, hone your skills.

58
00:08:12,498 --> 00:08:14,933
You have a gift, Michael.

59
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,871
I don't think I could forgive
myself if I saw it go to waste.

60
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,473
<i>"Dear Milo,</i>

61
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,208
<i>"this isn't goodbye.</i>

62
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,544
<i>"I'm gonna find a cure for us,</i>

63
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:28,146
<i>"so we can be
cranky old men someday.</i>

64
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,382

65
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:32,351
<i>"P.S. You shouldn't
have unfolded this.</i>

66
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,553
<i>"Now you'll never
get it back together.</i>

67
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:36,488
<i>See you this summer."</i>

68
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:39,424
No.

69
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,065
"Dear Milo..."

70
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,067
Please, can I have
my letter back?

71
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:51,870
- What?
- Please, can I have my letter?

72
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:53,205
Okay. Here.

73
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,209
Please. Ah!

74
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:59,578
Please!

75
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,680
Please!

76
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:06,318
Stop.

77
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,325
Go away!

78
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:19,998
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.

79
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,168
He tried to steal my letter!

80
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,203
Milo, Milo, stop.

81
00:09:25,337 --> 00:09:27,573
Stop. Stop. Stop.

82
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:29,975
What about Milo?

83
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:32,611
I'll look after Milo.

84
00:09:32,744 --> 00:09:33,946
He needs me.

85
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:39,551
Michael Morbius
completed his doctorate by 19

86
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,720
and quickly established himself

87
00:09:41,853 --> 00:09:45,991
as the world's leading authority
on blood-borne diseases.

88
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:48,293
His development
of artificial blood

89
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:51,964
has saved more lives
than penicillin.

90
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:54,099
Michael Morbius,

91
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:56,234
please step forward

92
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:58,470
to acknowledge
the receipt of your prize

93
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:01,773
from His Majesty,
the King of Sweden.

94
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:19,458
I can't believe you
dissed the king of Sweden.

95
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,627
The king and the queen,
their loyal subjects,

96
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,998
all of Scandinavia and
the entire scientific community.

97
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,933
Yeah, but who does that?

98
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:31,670
Well, Anna, we both know
I have issues.

99
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:34,673
But, hey, I kept the program.

100
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,381
There you are.

101
00:10:42,514 --> 00:10:44,549
- Hey, Dr. Bancroft.
- Hey, Anna.

102
00:10:44,683 --> 00:10:47,552
- We going to play?
- Oh, I don't think so.

103
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:50,555
See, now that Dr. Morbius
is back,

104
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:52,557
maybe you should
try losing for a while,

105
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:55,527
- see how that feels.
- Not gonna happen.

106
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:57,963
- Michael.
- Uh, yes?

107
00:10:58,097 --> 00:11:00,399
- You got a minute?
- Of course.

108
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:03,335
New one. For your collection.

109
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:07,806
Dr. Morbius is in trouble.

110
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,308
I'm in trouble.

111
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,644
"I can't accept a prize

112
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:15,380
for the by-product
of a failed experiment."

113
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:17,382
- Lab 1.
- Front page,

114
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:22,220
"American Scientist
Rejects Nobel Prize."

115
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,523
You know that people
actually like writing checks

116
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,391
to Nobel laureates?

117
00:11:26,525 --> 00:11:29,661
Makes them feel better
about their investment.

118
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:33,066
It would help if you stuck
around long enough to cash them.

119
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,068
You're pushing yourself

120
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,702
too hard.

121
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,274
Does our generous benefactor,
Milo,

122
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:44,609
know what
you're actually doing here?

123
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,745
What am I actually doing here?

124
00:11:46,878 --> 00:11:50,016
Remixing human DNA with bat DNA.

125
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,119
- I have no idea what you're...
- Talking about?

126
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:55,921
Is anything ringing a bell?

127
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,057
No bells ringing. Uh...

128
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:00,759
Okay. Maybe this
will jog your memory.

129
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,295
I wouldn't go
in there if I were you.

130
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:11,670
That is a...

131
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:13,905
- It's a fish tank.
- Hmm.

132
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,174
Like, for...

133
00:12:15,307 --> 00:12:17,110
flying mammals.

134
00:12:18,211 --> 00:12:19,611
Oh, I see.

135
00:12:19,745 --> 00:12:21,780
Some friends I brought back
from Costa Rica.

136
00:12:21,913 --> 00:12:24,016
So when were you gonna tell me?

137
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:28,920
More importantly,
how did you get my pass code?

138
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,756
It's the first six digits
of pi backwards.

139
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,457
It's your password
for everything.

140
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,925
You should change that.

141
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,894
You could lose your license
for this.

142
00:12:36,028 --> 00:12:39,798
I'm not gonna need it
much longer, doctor.

143
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:43,635
You, on the other hand, will.

144
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:48,640
You know, there's something
called "plausible deniability."

145
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,475
You should be thanking me.

146
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:58,750
These are the only mammals
on Earth

147
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:02,754
that have evolved
to feed exclusively on blood.

148
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,523
So in order to drink it,

149
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:09,995
these bats produce saliva that
contains unique anticoagulants.

150
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:12,731
So your theory is, if you can
successfully splice

151
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:14,100
vampire genes into your DNA,

152
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:16,102
it would allow your body
to produce

153
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:17,636
those same anticoagulants.

154
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:19,471
Yes.

155
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:21,439
It would be a cure.

156
00:13:21,573 --> 00:13:23,642
At what cost?

157
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,610
The fusion of different species

158
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:28,980
is a legacy
we already carry in our bodies.

159
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:32,651
Viruses insinuating
their nucleic acid onto our own

160
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:35,353
over hundreds of thousands
of years.

161
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:37,089
That's evolution.
This is different.

162
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,490
I don't think it is.

163
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:43,461
We have to push the boundaries,
take the risks.

164
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,363
Without that,

165
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:48,034
there is no science.

166
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,734
No medicine.

167
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,038
No breakthroughs at all.

168
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:01,247
Okay.

169
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,227
Test subject
for cell combination 117.

170
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:38,017
Come on, come on, come on.

171
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:59,071
Test subject
117 has resulted in...

172
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:01,973
failure.

173
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,315
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

174
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:14,353
I should've died years ago,
Martine.

175
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,357
Why am I still alive
if not to fix this?

176
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,426
To save my best friend, Milo.

177
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,461
And everyone else like us.

178
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:24,930
Not like this.

179
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,933
Dr. Morbius, it's Anna.

180
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:40,504
Her temperature's spiking,

181
00:15:40,545 --> 00:15:43,115
and her kidneys
are shutting down.

182
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:47,186
We have to induce a coma
before she has a stroke.

183
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,653
A hundred milligrams
of propofol.

184
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:50,622
- Sure.
- Now.

185
00:15:51,723 --> 00:15:52,991
Come on.

186
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,028
It's okay.

187
00:15:57,229 --> 00:15:59,265
It's okay. We got you.

188
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,101
There you go.

189
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,337
There you go.

190
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,440
Thank you, nurse.

191
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:09,708
We're gonna let you sleep a bit.

192
00:16:11,776 --> 00:16:14,846
Take a nice long nap.

193
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:26,758
- Michael.
- What?

194
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,995
It worked.

195
00:16:49,215 --> 00:16:51,050
Dr. Michael Morbius.

196
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:55,687
Some crippled guy's here to see the Boss.

197
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,324
Michael! Get over here!

198
00:16:58,457 --> 00:17:02,061
As long as I am a cripple you'll be fine.

199
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,363
<i>♪ Stop dreaming
Of the quiet life... ♪</i>

200
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,765
You're late.
I was trying out

201
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:08,666
this new thing
called "working."

202
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,270
Oh, yeah. I don't believe
I'm familiar with the word.

203
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:13,105
I don't believe you are.

204
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,074
So, what's up
with the goon squad?

205
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:17,742
Oh, I won a hand of cards
against some Russian gentlemen.

206
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,811
Apparently they found
his luck improbable.

207
00:17:19,944 --> 00:17:22,248
- There you are.
- More like impossible.

208
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,483
So, doctor,
how is our favorite patient?

209
00:17:24,616 --> 00:17:27,520
Still determined to make
his short life even shorter?

210
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,132
Yes, I am.
Anyway, you're one to talk.

211
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:30,989
You look terrible.
Look at the state of you.

212
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:34,093
Says the man wearing...
What is that, a quilt?

213
00:17:34,226 --> 00:17:36,895
Oh, sorry. I didn't get the memo
to dress for a funeral.

214
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:43,069
Right. I will see you later.

215
00:17:43,202 --> 00:17:44,569
And you...

216
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:46,038
my door is always open.

217
00:17:47,506 --> 00:17:49,275
We miss you at Horizon.

218
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:50,809
We could use your mind.

219
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:54,612
- I'll leave you two to your fun.
- Bye, Nicholas.

220
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,714
I have some good news.

221
00:17:56,848 --> 00:17:58,716
Let's go for a walk.

222
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,153
How's Martine doing these days?

223
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,290
Dr. Bancroft?
She is, uh, overqualified,

224
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:06,624
outperforming,
brilliant as usual.

225
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,561
And a royal pain in my ass.

226
00:18:08,693 --> 00:18:11,133
But she's keeping me honest for
the most part. Why do you ask?

227
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:15,134
Eh, no reason. Just haven't
seen you in forever.

228
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,336
I wondered if she had
something to do with it.

229
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,472
Aw, I miss you too.

230
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:22,475
But, yes, she has been working
with me to save our lives.

231
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:26,145
I could ask her to stop if you
like, put us out of our misery.

232
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:28,980
Just don't do something stupid
and go and fall in love

233
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:30,483
because, believe you me,

234
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,784
there is absolutely
no cure for that.

235
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,587
Says the guy who knows
absolutely nothing

236
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:35,992
- about the subject.
- Not true.

237
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:37,655
I read about it
in books all the time.

238
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,791
- Books, really? Wow.
- Yeah.

239
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,627
Or romantic comedies.
The point is...

240
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,332
The point is, love is not
on the cards for us, my friend.

241
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:48,833
Listen, if you start quoting
<i>The Notebook</i> to me,

242
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,103
I am going to stop
and hobble very slowly

243
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:53,105
in the opposite direction.

244
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,706
Throw it!

245
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,342
I'm close, Milo.

246
00:18:57,476 --> 00:18:59,011
I can feel it.

247
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:02,348
A cure.

248
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:05,217
It's finally possible.

249
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:10,688
- Seriously?
- Highly experimental.

250
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:13,392
Ethically questionable.

251
00:19:14,627 --> 00:19:17,163
Very, very, very expensive.

252
00:19:17,296 --> 00:19:21,400
- I knew that was coming.
- And not exactly legal.

253
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:23,835
Oh, and it has to be done
in international waters.

254
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,107
You were always expensive.

255
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,211
Is it dangerous?
Should I be worried?

256
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:34,946
- You want me to lie to you?
- That would be nice, yes.

257
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,781
It's a walk in the park
on a sunny day.

258
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:38,484
Oh, yeah, that bad, eh?

259
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:41,453
Listen.

260
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,956
We don't have much time left.

261
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,861
This could be our last chance.

262
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,434
So, what do you say?

263
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,238
We go out with a fight?

264
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:03,542
Yeah.

265
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:08,846
You with me?

266
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,748
Till the day you die, brother.

267
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:15,287
Till the day you die.
You'll have everything you need.

268
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,789
We're the original Spartans,
mate.

269
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:21,594
- The few against the many.
- Yeah.

270
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:32,071
You know,
I'm sure you're cheating.

271
00:20:32,204 --> 00:20:34,506
No. No, you're not.

272
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,740
What you got?

273
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,909
Putting another one in the oven.

274
00:20:38,043 --> 00:20:39,578
Wish me luck.

275
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:48,387
The moment of truth.

276
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,607
Success, Martine. We did it.

277
00:21:08,741 --> 00:21:10,175
It's holding together.

278
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:13,911
Test 243.

279
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:17,416
Human trials.

280
00:21:33,198 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm glad it's you.

281
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:42,408
Had a lot of other suitors,
didn't you?

282
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,243
Yeah.

283
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,145
You know,
the whole near-death thing

284
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:48,647
is very, very chic.

285
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:53,786
I read it in <i>Cosmo.</i>

286
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:56,288
Do they still make <i>Cosmo?</i>
I don't know.

287
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:09,735
I know it's just
what you always wanted.

288
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,671
Could be a collector's item
one day, you never know.

289
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:16,041
This better not be my last one.

290
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:18,410
I know this is painful,
but you got it.

291
00:22:21,846 --> 00:22:25,017
- That's it. Bingo.
- Right there.

292
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:31,390
Almost there, almost there.

293
00:22:35,661 --> 00:22:39,131
It's all right.
Come on. Come on.

294
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:40,799
There you go.

295
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:52,044
You can buckle me up.

296
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:54,346
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

297
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,648
You all right? Great.

298
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:24,576
I call.

299
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:28,647
- Bringing out the big guns.
- Let's go again.

300
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:30,716
I'll be back.
I'm gonna check on the doctor.

301
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:32,017
All right.

302
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:53,372
- You shouldn't be down here.
- I can be wherever I want, nurse.

303
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:55,307
It's "doctor," actually.

304
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,976
I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave.

305
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:02,681
Doctor. Sure, I can see it.

306
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:06,518
But, uh, you're still the help,
just like me.

307
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:08,253
Wow.

308
00:24:08,387 --> 00:24:11,156
You can tell all that
by just looking at me, huh?

309
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,593
Here I thought you were just
another jacked-up dumb shit.

310
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,995
Get out.

311
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:26,338
Michael?

312
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,853
- Michael?
- Where is he?

313
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:42,621
Don't move.

314
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,325
What the hell?

315
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,660
Everybody down to the lab now.

316
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:50,596
Roger that.

317
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,300
Don't shoot!

318
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:06,044
Michael!

319
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,548
Stop!

320
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:16,889
Michael.

321
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:22,594
It's just me.

322
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:23,862
It's just me.

323
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,532
Michael, please.

324
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,669
Michael, stop!

325
00:25:30,802 --> 00:25:34,106
Stop! Please!

326
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:36,508
You're hurting yourself! Stop!

327
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:39,678
Hey! Step back! Move!

328
00:25:39,811 --> 00:25:42,814
- Stop. Put that gun down...
- Move!

329
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:05,103
Shit. Close it! Close it!

330
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:06,672
What the hell is that thing?

331
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:25,991
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Shit.

332
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:35,634
- Let's move.
- Go, go, go!

333
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,440
Johnny!

334
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:46,979
Get out of here!

335
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:52,317
<i>Sweeping Level 3.</i>

336
00:26:53,418 --> 00:26:55,054
Jason, come in.

337
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:56,755
Jason. Jason?

338
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,995
Oh, shit.

339
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:06,665
Son of a bitch!

340
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,875
Shit! Oh!

341
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,143
Oh, shit!

342
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,117
Martine.

343
00:29:05,218 --> 00:29:06,618
Martine.

344
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh, my God.

345
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:52,430
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

346
00:29:52,564 --> 00:29:55,634
This is the <i>LCV Murnau.</i>

347
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,436
Call letters 3-X5Y.

348
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,573
<i>We are 13 nautical miles
off the coast of Long Island.</i>

349
00:30:01,706 --> 00:30:04,442
<i>Request immediate airlift.</i>

350
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:08,814
<i>Repeat, this is the</i> LCV Murnau.

351
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:11,950
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday.</i>

352
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:30,169
It's up here to the right.

353
00:30:30,303 --> 00:30:34,639
FBI Agent Stroud.
Can we have the room, please?

354
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,176
You heard the man.
Can we please have the room?

355
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,744
If you could start exiting,
that'd be fantastic.

356
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:47,552
Well, we haven't had
anything this good

357
00:30:47,686 --> 00:30:49,322
since that thing
in San Francisco.

358
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:51,389
Uh, eight bodies,
running IDs right now,

359
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:55,627
but apparently they all shop at
the same mercenary supply store.

360
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,864
Uh, one survivor,
a Dr. Martine Bancroft.

361
00:30:58,997 --> 00:31:01,067
- Can we talk to her?
- If she wakes up.

362
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,735
Uh, she fell down
and hit her head, apparently.

363
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:06,538
- Anything else?
- Someone made a mayday call.

364
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:08,406
- Not Dr. Bancroft.
- Nope.

365
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,742
It was a male,
didn't identify himself,

366
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,644
then wiped
all the surveillance footage.

367
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:14,655
He grew a conscience
and jumped overboard?

368
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:16,315
It happens. Oh, and get this.

369
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,550
All the bodies
that you're looking at

370
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:21,620
are nearly drained
of their blood.

371
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:25,191
So, what hunts at night
and drinks human blood?

372
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:28,960
You're gonna love this.

373
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,462
<i>Early this morning</i>

374
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,198
<i>an unmanned cargo ship
was discovered</i>

375
00:31:32,331 --> 00:31:34,200
<i>near the eastern tip
of Long Island</i>

376
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,867
<i>with multiple bodies on board.</i>

377
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:39,038
<i>Authorities are not making
any comment at this time.</i>

378
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:40,906
<i>But there are reports
of one survivor,</i>

379
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,407
<i>and we have learned</i>

380
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,110
<i>from a high-ranking Coast
Guard official</i>

381
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:46,279
<i>that the vessel was flying
a Panamanian flag</i>

382
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:49,048
<i>when it drifted in
from international...</i>

383
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:52,851
What's happened?

384
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,222
Some kind of accident.

385
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:02,194
How's your pain today?
On a one to ten?

386
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:04,696
Eleven.

387
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,134
I'm sorry.

388
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:45,537
You're going to be okay.

389
00:32:58,384 --> 00:33:00,119
Lab 1.

390
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:01,753
Privacy screens.

391
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:21,706
Come on. Come on.

392
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,864
As a result of my procedure,

393
00:34:19,998 --> 00:34:22,901
<i>I have an overpowering urge
to consume...</i>

394
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,738
<i>blood.</i>

395
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,307
Human blood.

396
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:33,912
<i>In certain respects,
I have succeeded</i>

397
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:37,316
<i>far beyond anything
I could have imagined.</i>

398
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,420
<i>For the first time
in my entire life, I feel...</i>

399
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:42,887
<i>good.</i>

400
00:34:43,022 --> 00:34:44,889
<i>Yesterday, I could barely walk.</i>

401
00:34:45,024 --> 00:34:48,294
<i>Today, I don't know
what I'm capable of.</i>

402
00:35:00,939 --> 00:35:03,375
<i>For a period of time
after ingestion,</i>

403
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:04,909
my numbers are off the charts.

404
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:08,947
I have the constitution
of an Olympic athlete.

405
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:11,050
<i>Increased strength and speed</i>

406
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:13,085
<i>that can only be described as...</i>

407
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:14,587
<i>superhuman.</i>

408
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,855
<i>And all of this...</i>

409
00:35:16,988 --> 00:35:19,058
<i>on artificial blood.</i>

410
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:31,970
<i>I've become something different.</i>

411
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:33,872
<i>I feel a kinship
with these creatures.</i>

412
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:39,644
<i>They would tear anyone else
apart, but they welcome me.</i>

413
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:41,447
<i>Like a brother.</i>

414
00:35:56,928 --> 00:36:01,666
<i>I've even developed
a form of echolocation.</i>

415
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:04,303
<i>Bat radar, for the uninitiated.</i>

416
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,873
<i>The question is:</i>

417
00:36:09,008 --> 00:36:10,875
<i>How do I control it?</i>

418
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,611
Isolate it?

419
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:16,781
Breathe.

420
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:20,785
And let it go.

421
00:36:51,183 --> 00:36:54,620
<i>But, unfortunately,
this condition is temporary.</i>

422
00:36:57,722 --> 00:37:00,259
<i>I've been timing myself.</i>

423
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:05,097
<i>Artificial blood keeps me
stable for six hours.</i>

424
00:37:05,231 --> 00:37:07,499
<i>But that window...</i>

425
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,501
<i>is growing shorter.</i>

426
00:37:09,635 --> 00:37:12,371
<i>Artificial blood
won't work forever.</i>

427
00:37:14,173 --> 00:37:16,041
<i>One question remains:</i>

428
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:18,577
<i>What if...?</i>

429
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:22,214
<i>What if artificial blood
becomes ineffective?</i>

430
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:25,783
<i>What happens if I go without?</i>

431
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,620
<i>No blue...</i>

432
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:29,121
<i>No red...</i>

433
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:30,389
<i>Nothing.</i>

434
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,894
<i>Eventually, my vitals
drop precipitously</i>

435
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:39,431
<i>and my illness returns
with a vengeance.</i>

436
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,635
<i>Soon, I'll face a choice.</i>

437
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,305
<i>Drink the red...</i>

438
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:48,007
<i>or die.</i>

439
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,442
<i>But what happened
on that ship...</i>

440
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:53,145
<i>can't ever happen again.</i>

441
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,509
Michael.

442
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:25,077
It's me.

443
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,345
You in here?

444
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:30,582
Where are you?

445
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:36,722
Michael?

446
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:39,491
Michael? What are you doing?

447
00:38:40,925 --> 00:38:43,495
Michael, it's Milo.
What are you doing?

448
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:46,365
Do you need help?

449
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,068
What?

450
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,343
"Blood."

451
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:02,014
You want the blood
in the freezer? Wait.

452
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:06,618
I'm coming, I'm coming.

453
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,287
I'm coming.

454
00:39:16,362 --> 00:39:18,797
Michael, hang on.

455
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,066
Here. Here.

456
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,378
Michael...

457
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:46,258
You're... You're strong.

458
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:48,093
Michael.

459
00:39:48,227 --> 00:39:50,295
You did it.

460
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,765
You did it.
You found a cure to live.

461
00:39:52,897 --> 00:39:54,133
Michael.

462
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,269
What? What is it?

463
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:59,738
I've made a terrible mistake,
Milo.

464
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:01,807
We all make mistakes.
Don't worry about it.

465
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:03,642
You've never made
one like this before.

466
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,976
Michael, enough.

467
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,712
Just give it to me. I need it.

468
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:08,946
I can't live like this
any longer. Please.

469
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:11,450
- I can't.
- What do you mean, you can't?

470
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:15,687
- I can't.
- I need this. I...

471
00:40:15,821 --> 00:40:17,856
I've done things, Milo.

472
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:23,529
I killed people.

473
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:26,465
W-we... We can make that go away.

474
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:29,868
The ones on the boat,
they're thugs, guns for hire.

475
00:40:30,002 --> 00:40:31,746
- I can make that go away.
- You don't understand.

476
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,073
I do understand. Please.
Have I ever denied you anything?

477
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,809
Said no?
Have I always given you...?

478
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:39,044
I can't control it!

479
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:43,348
What, so... So you get to live
and I get to die? Is that it?

480
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,288
It's a curse.

481
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:52,524
Believe me, brother. It is.

482
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:56,261
Now, please, I need you to go.

483
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:57,995
- It's not safe here.
- No.

484
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,767
No, don't make me go.
Please, Michael, don't...

485
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,502
I said, get out!

486
00:41:09,974 --> 00:41:11,743
I said, get out!

487
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:25,591
Milo.

488
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:32,631
She's right here.

489
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:39,671
Dr. Bancroft?
Agents Stroud and Rodriguez.

490
00:41:40,939 --> 00:41:42,708
How you feeling, doctor?

491
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:46,578
Like I'm in a hospital,
eating really crappy Jell-O.

492
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,881
This shouldn't take long.

493
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:50,549
You were out on a container ship

494
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,252
that washed up
off of Long Island.

495
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,888
Doctor, there were
eight dead bodies inside.

496
00:41:56,021 --> 00:42:00,492
We also noticed that their blood
was... What do you call it?

497
00:42:00,626 --> 00:42:03,595
Exsanguinated.
I looked it up.

498
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,499
So, um, sorry
for the graphic nature

499
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:08,867
of some of these photos.

500
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:10,569
But, um, you're a doctor,

501
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:13,238
so you know what people
look like on the inside.

502
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:16,375
These puncture wounds
right there,

503
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:18,677
those look like fang marks
to you?

504
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:29,922
Well, you were out there
conducting a major experiment.

505
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:33,592
We're just hoping
you could shed some light.

506
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:37,229
Yeah, that...
Not exactly sanitary, isn't it?

507
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:40,277
I'm having a little bit
of a hard time

508
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:42,434
remembering what happened
that night.

509
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:45,304
Sure. Let's go.

510
00:42:49,408 --> 00:42:53,078
You also work
at the Horizon Lab, right?

511
00:42:53,211 --> 00:42:55,714
With Dr. Michael Morbius.

512
00:42:55,847 --> 00:42:56,982
Yes.

513
00:42:59,718 --> 00:43:01,753
Appreciate your time, doctor.

514
00:43:39,224 --> 00:43:40,392
Hello?

515
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,704
Who's there?

516
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,012
Hello?

517
00:45:08,714 --> 00:45:11,917
<i>Get away from her.
Just step back.</i>

518
00:45:12,051 --> 00:45:13,919
<i>Has she been there all night?</i>

519
00:45:14,053 --> 00:45:17,456
<i>Looks like all the blood
was drained from her body.</i>

520
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:32,671
- Any contusions?
- Not that I can see.

521
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:40,213
Back to our rooms, okay?

522
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:11,810
Dr. Morbius?

523
00:46:12,911 --> 00:46:14,147
Agent Stroud.

524
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:16,515
Agent Rodriguez.
Can we have a minute?

525
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,085
Of course. How can I help you?

526
00:46:19,218 --> 00:46:21,187
First, I wanna say thank you.

527
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:22,721
Your artificial blood

528
00:46:22,854 --> 00:46:26,458
actually saved my arm
in Afghanistan, sir.

529
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:28,326
I'm glad I could be of service.

530
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,829
I mean, I must admit, doc,
you don't look

531
00:46:30,962 --> 00:46:33,132
anything like you do
on the news.

532
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:35,168
Yeah, you look downright robust.

533
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,903
I have good days and bad.

534
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:39,771
Pilates helps.

535
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:41,740
How are you on boats?

536
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:44,309
As you can see...

537
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,679
don't have very good sea legs.

538
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,116
Why do you ask?

539
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:51,783
'Cause you've been
looking for a cure

540
00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:54,653
for your condition
your whole life, right?

541
00:46:54,786 --> 00:46:57,889
You've pretty much
tried everything.

542
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:01,693
Crazy experiments,
maybe on a boat?

543
00:47:01,827 --> 00:47:05,397
"Crazy" isn't a term
that I would use...

544
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,698
detective.

545
00:47:06,832 --> 00:47:09,534
Unorthodox, maybe.

546
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:12,637
But I'd do just about anything
to save a life.

547
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:15,308
I'm sure
you can understand that.

548
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,543
Anything else I can
help you two with?

549
00:47:21,013 --> 00:47:23,658
<i>All
units, the 120 block, Horizon Labs,</i>

550
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:25,560
<i>female body drained of blood,
initiate lock down.</i>

551
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:30,822
Copy that. Doc, got
a couple more questions for you.

552
00:47:30,956 --> 00:47:33,692
Yeah, you're coming with us.

553
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:39,965
Hey, freeze!

554
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,234
Stop him!

555
00:47:43,635 --> 00:47:45,171
Hey!

556
00:47:54,512 --> 00:47:56,282
Hold fire!

557
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:58,583
Get backup and meet me up top.

558
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:23,209
Enough.

559
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,183
<i>It's worse than I first thought.</i>

560
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:33,685
<i>At this rate, artificial blood
will stop working</i>

561
00:48:33,818 --> 00:48:35,687
<i>in a matter of days.</i>

562
00:48:37,256 --> 00:48:39,624
8:13 p.m.

563
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,865
Down from six hours
to four hours, 22 minutes.

564
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:52,470
I got a problem.

565
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:13,692
Holy water?

566
00:49:15,227 --> 00:49:17,430
- Really?
- What?

567
00:49:17,562 --> 00:49:20,032
I'm not taking any chances.

568
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,633
It's triple blessed.

569
00:49:26,272 --> 00:49:29,208
We found this little guy
on the container ship...

570
00:49:30,642 --> 00:49:32,278
with those bodies.

571
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:36,415
That's a little hobby
of yours, right?

572
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:43,688
You know,
eight dead mercs on a boat

573
00:49:43,822 --> 00:49:45,991
really doesn't
ruffle our feathers.

574
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,027
I'm pretty sure
they were guilty of something

575
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,928
and happy to have them off
the water.

576
00:49:50,062 --> 00:49:55,834
But Nurse Sutton, single mother
with twin girls, that's...

577
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,537
- something else.
- Yes, I know.

578
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:01,539
Her name was Kristen.
We worked together

579
00:50:01,673 --> 00:50:03,808
every single day
for seven years.

580
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,711
She was a good person.

581
00:50:06,845 --> 00:50:08,713
So why'd you do it?

582
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,420
I can't answer that.

583
00:50:22,328 --> 00:50:24,763
What did you do to yourself,
doctor?

584
00:50:26,132 --> 00:50:28,566
- Make us understand.
- I wish I knew.

585
00:50:33,205 --> 00:50:34,672
Okay.

586
00:50:34,806 --> 00:50:37,575
Great stuff.
Um, Really informative.

587
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:40,578
- Thank you. Uh...
- I dropped a bag.

588
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:42,580
There's something inside
that I need.

589
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:44,816
- Bag of artificial blood.
- Yeah.

590
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:47,353
Yeah. It's in evidence,
I'm sorry.

591
00:50:52,991 --> 00:50:54,260
I'm sorry.

592
00:50:55,894 --> 00:50:57,695
I'm starting to get hungry.

593
00:50:59,298 --> 00:51:01,666
And you don't wanna see me
when I'm hungry.

594
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,240
We're done here. Let's go.

595
00:51:11,177 --> 00:51:13,145
Guard!

596
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,383
Your lawyer's here.

597
00:51:30,563 --> 00:51:31,763
You look terrible.

598
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:36,801
Lawyer, huh?

599
00:51:36,935 --> 00:51:39,271
I don't remember
you ever finishing law school.

600
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:41,073
'Cause I didn't.

601
00:51:43,608 --> 00:51:45,377
Sit down. Sit down.

602
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:51,916
I mean, if one of us
was going to end up

603
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:53,818
in bright orange trainers,

604
00:51:53,952 --> 00:51:56,489
I would never have guessed
it would be you.

605
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:01,393
They're charging me with murder.

606
00:52:03,628 --> 00:52:06,265
I don't know. I don't know.

607
00:52:07,466 --> 00:52:09,001
I...

608
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:11,170
Maybe I blacked out? Uh...

609
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:14,473
Hey.

610
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:16,142
Now listen to me.

611
00:52:18,277 --> 00:52:20,012
I don't believe it.

612
00:52:20,146 --> 00:52:22,314
You're not capable of that.

613
00:52:22,448 --> 00:52:27,019
I know that all you've ever
tried to do is help people.

614
00:52:27,153 --> 00:52:28,621
You don't belong here.

615
00:52:28,753 --> 00:52:29,954
This place is for terrorists

616
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:31,990
and drugs lords
and God knows who.

617
00:52:32,124 --> 00:52:35,628
Michael, we need
to get you out of here.

618
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,096
In whatever way possible.

619
00:52:37,229 --> 00:52:39,165
Maybe this is where I belong.

620
00:52:39,298 --> 00:52:41,933
If I'm in here,
then nobody else dies.

621
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:43,302
Listen to me.

622
00:52:43,435 --> 00:52:46,305
You are not capable
of killing that woman.

623
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,109
Hey, Your Highness, time's up.

624
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,945
Michael, here's something
to keep you going.

625
00:52:55,914 --> 00:52:57,550
Guard.

626
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:26,412
Never too early.

627
00:53:41,726 --> 00:53:43,162
Milo.

628
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:02,114
Milo!

629
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:32,120
Let's move!

630
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,313
Come on, this way!

631
00:54:43,022 --> 00:54:44,657
Let's go. Let's go.

632
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:46,025
Open the door.

633
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:48,093
Now! Go!

634
00:54:48,227 --> 00:54:49,961
He's getting away!

635
00:55:12,984 --> 00:55:14,520
<i>Daily Bugle,</i> please, sir.

636
00:55:14,653 --> 00:55:18,290
- There you go, buddy.
- Here you are, my friend.

637
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:21,393
Always figured that guy
for a freak.

638
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,495
How's that?
You've never met him.

639
00:55:23,629 --> 00:55:26,231
I mean, look at him.
What else you need to know?

640
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:29,535
<i>You know, you shouldn't
judge someone by how they look.</i>

641
00:55:29,668 --> 00:55:32,204
<i>Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?</i>

642
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:34,306
<i>Take me, for example.</i>

643
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,809
<i>I may look harmless enough.</i>

644
00:55:36,941 --> 00:55:39,211
Do you think I'm joking?

00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,198
Milo!

646
00:56:00,998 --> 00:56:02,234
Got me.

647
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:04,737
You see? I knew you could do it.

648
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,573
You took the serum
even after I warned you.

649
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:09,341
What am I gonna do,
lay down and die?

650
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,044
- Thank you for the death wish.
- I tried to protect you!

651
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:14,012
Protect me?
Protect me from what?

652
00:56:14,146 --> 00:56:15,447
Becoming a monster like me.

653
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,183
I don't think you're a monster.
Okay?

654
00:56:18,317 --> 00:56:19,884
I killed the nurse.

655
00:56:20,018 --> 00:56:21,553
I killed the nurse.

656
00:56:21,687 --> 00:56:24,556
I know. But you know
what it's like your first time.

657
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:28,260
You have no idea what you're
doing. You have no control.

658
00:56:28,394 --> 00:56:29,595
No.

659
00:56:31,996 --> 00:56:33,866
Milo, you have to stop.

660
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:37,302
You have to stop. You have
to stop denying who you are.

661
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,639
It's boring. We can go anywhere,
we can do anything. Let's go.

662
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,408
Let's have some fun.

663
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,143
This isn't you.

664
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,214
I know you. Where's the brother
that I used to have?

665
00:56:49,348 --> 00:56:51,350
How can you say that to me?

666
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:54,353
Look what you've become.

667
00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:56,288
Everything I am,
I am because of you.

668
00:56:56,422 --> 00:56:58,590
I looked up to you
my whole life.

669
00:56:58,724 --> 00:57:02,094
I will never leave you,
and I will not go back.

670
00:57:02,227 --> 00:57:05,864
You cannot make me go back.
I won't let you make me go back!

671
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,649
Move, bitch, move!

672
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:37,429
- Goodness.
- Whoo!

673
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,365
We've evolved!

674
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,035
You're a scientist, Michael.

675
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:46,004
Surely, surely
you understand that.

676
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:48,841
That's not what this is.
This is a mistake.

677
00:57:48,973 --> 00:57:52,177
But I can fix it. I'll figure
out how to reverse it.

678
00:57:52,311 --> 00:57:54,680
Artificial blood will keep us
stable until I do.

679
00:57:54,813 --> 00:57:57,982
Yeah, I'm fine just the way
I am, thank you very much.

680
00:57:58,116 --> 00:58:00,185
Hey! Hands up!

681
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,521
- Up against the wall. Now.
- Officer.

682
00:58:02,654 --> 00:58:04,189
- Come on.
- Anything you say.

683
00:58:04,323 --> 00:58:06,258
- You. Don't move.
- Okey-do key.

684
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,662
We have the suspects.

685
00:58:10,796 --> 00:58:12,664
Like we used to say...

686
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:13,966
live a little.

687
00:58:18,837 --> 00:58:19,972
Hey!

688
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:21,240
Freeze!

689
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:36,555
All our lives, we've lived
with death hanging over us.

690
00:58:36,688 --> 00:58:38,223
Why?

691
00:58:38,357 --> 00:58:40,459
Why shouldn't they know
what it feels like

692
00:58:40,592 --> 00:58:44,196
for a change, Michael?

693
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:47,866
Michael!

694
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:50,202
Michael.

695
00:59:06,852 --> 00:59:08,520
I'm not gonna fight you, Milo.

696
01:00:23,128 --> 01:00:25,998
Now he's laying out
officers in my city, huh?

697
01:00:27,132 --> 01:00:28,700
It's unforgiveable.

698
01:00:32,437 --> 01:00:34,840
Just keep your eyes
on Dr. Bancroft.

699
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:36,375
Yeah.

700
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:33,765
Woman in the jeans,
where'd she go?

701
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:35,534
Yeah, right.

702
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,042
Great.

703
01:01:56,655 --> 01:01:58,490
Hey, stranger.

704
01:02:00,692 --> 01:02:01,827
Michael?

705
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:07,666
You shouldn't be here.

706
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:11,503
I didn't kill Nurse Sutton
or the police.

707
01:02:12,637 --> 01:02:14,107
Or any of those people.

708
01:02:15,974 --> 01:02:17,342
I know.

709
01:02:17,476 --> 01:02:18,710
Milo, he...

710
01:02:18,844 --> 01:02:21,880
He took the serum.

711
01:02:22,014 --> 01:02:23,915
He's out there.

712
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:25,917
And I have to stop him.

713
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,821
But I need your help.

714
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,796
Coffee?

715
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:40,499
- No, thanks. I quit caffeine.
- It's decaf.

716
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:52,978
Not that kind of vampire.

717
01:02:53,112 --> 01:02:54,646
Just checking.

718
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:58,316
I shouldn't have dragged you
out there. I'm sorry.

719
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,452
You didn't.

720
01:03:00,585 --> 01:03:02,054
I wanted to be there.

721
01:03:02,188 --> 01:03:04,656
Well, then apology rescinded.

722
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,491
I guess we're both
a little crazy.

723
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:07,959
How do you feel?

724
01:03:08,094 --> 01:03:09,394
Incredible.

725
01:03:09,528 --> 01:03:11,463
I mean, I went from dying
my entire life

726
01:03:11,596 --> 01:03:13,565
to feeling more alive than ever.

727
01:03:13,698 --> 01:03:16,401
Thankfully, artificial blood
keeps me stable.

728
01:03:16,535 --> 01:03:18,637
I just have to drink it
more often.

729
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:20,273
- How often?
- Uh...

730
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,742
Every four hours, 22 minutes.
Down from six.

731
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:26,012
It's losing its effectiveness.

732
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:29,614
The issue is,
when it stops working...

733
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,552
I'll become like Milo.

734
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:36,822
You won't.

735
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,559
Hi. Over there.

736
01:03:46,631 --> 01:03:48,067
Sorry, this one's no good.

737
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,635
Check it again.
And keep one for yourself.

738
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:52,637
No, I don't wanna do it.

739
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:54,411
There's plenty more
where those came from.

740
01:03:54,506 --> 01:03:56,575
Come on, man,
we gotta get back to the lab.

741
01:04:03,748 --> 01:04:04,883
Michael?

742
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:06,618
Okay, I know that look.

743
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,653
You're up to something.
What is it?

744
01:04:08,787 --> 01:04:10,622
I'll need a couple of things
from the lab.

745
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,291
- Can you do that for me?
- Yes, I can.

746
01:04:12,424 --> 01:04:14,327
But you didn't answer
my question. What is it?

747
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:16,728
You're right.
I'm up to something.

748
01:04:25,204 --> 01:04:28,341
- You got the blood?
- Got it.

749
01:04:59,238 --> 01:05:01,240
<i>The ink on this
new batch is pretty legit.</i>

750
01:05:01,374 --> 01:05:03,708
<i>It's a good thing
we switched the chemicals.</i>

751
01:05:03,842 --> 01:05:05,211
<i>Yo, finish up.</i>

752
01:05:38,777 --> 01:05:41,646
It's a nice place
that you got here.

753
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,949
Oh, I love this movie.
Is this the part

754
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,960
where the mysterious guy
with the hoodie comes in

755
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:47,784
and kicks everybody's asses?
I love that part.

756
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:50,841
- Who the hell are you?
- It doesn't matter,

757
01:05:50,956 --> 01:05:53,525
but I am gonna need
your laboratory.

758
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:55,578
You can keep the money,

759
01:05:55,627 --> 01:05:56,828
all your little toys.

760
01:05:56,962 --> 01:05:58,663
Just leave the science-y stuff

761
01:05:58,797 --> 01:06:01,267
and that bag of spicy Cheetos.

762
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,102
- He wants my lab?
- Yeah.

763
01:06:03,235 --> 01:06:06,205
You trying to be funny?

764
01:06:06,339 --> 01:06:09,241
No, no, no. Absolutely not.
That's their job.

765
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:11,444
I mean, look
at their matching necklaces.

766
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:13,012
Time to go.

767
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:17,949
Did you know that there are
27 bones in the human hand?

768
01:06:18,084 --> 01:06:19,251
Allow me

769
01:06:19,385 --> 01:06:21,653
to introduce the phalanges.

770
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:23,155
The metacarpals.

771
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:24,729
Shit.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

772
01:06:24,823 --> 01:06:27,426
And the pretty,
little stinky pinkie.

773
01:06:30,628 --> 01:06:32,764
- Who the hell are you, man?
- Me?

774
01:06:32,897 --> 01:06:36,534
I am Venom.

775
01:06:38,437 --> 01:06:40,739
You can go now.

776
01:06:43,309 --> 01:06:47,013
Six to eight weeks,
a little ibuprofen.

777
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:49,514
Should heal up just fine.

778
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:17,536
Yo. Can I get a tequila, please?

779
01:08:17,669 --> 01:08:19,071
Don Julio 1942.

780
01:08:29,714 --> 01:08:31,383
Do I know you?

781
01:08:31,517 --> 01:08:32,717
Me?

782
01:08:32,851 --> 01:08:35,221
- Yeah.
- No, I don't think so.

783
01:08:36,455 --> 01:08:37,956
We've met.

784
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,326
- I'm sure of it.
- No, I'd remember.

785
01:08:41,527 --> 01:08:43,262
You're too pretty.

786
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:46,865
You know what they say, "Tequila
to remember, whiskey to forget."

787
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:49,634
That's good.

788
01:08:49,767 --> 01:08:51,504
Sir, two tequilas, please.

789
01:08:54,573 --> 01:08:56,208
Hey, yo.

790
01:08:57,809 --> 01:09:00,146
Her drinks are spoken for, bro.

791
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:02,348
<i>Salute.</i>

792
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:05,950
You know, uh, ahem,
I'm gonna do you a favor

793
01:09:06,085 --> 01:09:08,220
and let you walk out of here,
all right?

794
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:09,654
That's very kind of you.

795
01:09:09,787 --> 01:09:11,956
Here was I thinking
you were a complete asshole.

796
01:09:12,091 --> 01:09:13,791
- Sir, can I get my friend here...
- Relax.

797
01:09:13,925 --> 01:09:17,163
And his friends
a round of whiskeys?

798
01:09:19,265 --> 01:09:21,467
Hey!

799
01:09:28,107 --> 01:09:29,707
I'll get you another drink.

800
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:32,344
Hey.

801
01:09:34,446 --> 01:09:35,614
Another time.

802
01:09:38,683 --> 01:09:39,851
Jerk.

803
01:09:41,853 --> 01:09:45,424
You see the size of that guy?
I'm not paying for those drinks.

804
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,092
Martine.

805
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:24,597
Milo.

806
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:25,930
Sorry. I let myself in.

807
01:10:26,065 --> 01:10:28,434
I hope I didn't startle you.

808
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:30,269
It's okay.

809
01:10:30,402 --> 01:10:32,047
If I'd known
our biggest funder was coming,

810
01:10:32,071 --> 01:10:35,341
I would have planned
a nice dinner for us.

811
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,012
Actually, I've already eaten.

812
01:10:43,382 --> 01:10:46,051
Whatever it is, it's doing
wonders for your health.

813
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:51,156
I feel great.

814
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:53,626
- What can I do for you?
- Well, it's Michael.

815
01:10:53,758 --> 01:10:54,993
I'm worried about him.

816
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:57,396
He's alone out there.

817
01:10:57,529 --> 01:11:00,765
And I think he needs me.

818
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:04,136
If I can get to him before
the police do, I can help him.

819
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:07,172
You wouldn't happen to know
where he is, would you?

820
01:11:07,306 --> 01:11:10,509
You two have always been
so close.

821
01:11:10,643 --> 01:11:12,344
I'm sorry.

822
01:11:14,113 --> 01:11:15,281
I don't.

823
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:20,885
Hmm.

824
01:11:24,056 --> 01:11:25,257
Just to be sure,

825
01:11:25,391 --> 01:11:27,559
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

826
01:11:29,528 --> 01:11:32,765
You don't happen to know
where he is, do you, Martine?

827
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:34,733
I wouldn't lie to you, Milo.

828
01:11:37,869 --> 01:11:39,004
I don't.

829
01:11:43,742 --> 01:11:46,345
Now, if you don't mind,
I have work to do.

830
01:11:46,478 --> 01:11:48,113
Okay.

831
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:51,050
Well, if you see him,
if you hear from him, tell him:

832
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:54,186
"We are the few
against the many."

833
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,290
We'll have to do that dinner
another time, Martine.

834
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,218
Police!

835
01:12:35,127 --> 01:12:36,395
Clear!

836
01:12:38,097 --> 01:12:39,531
Clear!

837
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,210
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

838
01:12:57,516 --> 01:13:01,453
Cat's gone. And she's
probably gone along with it.

839
01:13:05,557 --> 01:13:07,459
It's time to eat,
you little monster.

840
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:08,727
Oh!

841
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:12,064
Shit.

842
01:13:19,004 --> 01:13:21,073
Michael?

843
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:24,276
Hey.

844
01:13:25,411 --> 01:13:27,012
Michael.

845
01:13:27,146 --> 01:13:28,847
I'm sorry.

846
01:13:32,484 --> 01:13:34,420
You may wanna close that up.

847
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:35,721
Yep.

848
01:13:45,164 --> 01:13:47,299
How does it feel...

849
01:13:47,433 --> 01:13:49,301
when you're on red?

850
01:13:51,437 --> 01:13:54,373
Something wakes up
inside of me, something...

851
01:13:56,775 --> 01:13:58,177
primal.

852
01:14:00,913 --> 01:14:02,581
And it just, uh...

853
01:14:05,784 --> 01:14:07,586
And it wants to hunt.

854
01:14:09,755 --> 01:14:11,523
And wants to kill.

855
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:19,164
I'm sorry.

856
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:52,297
Hi.

857
01:14:55,267 --> 01:14:56,468
Good as new.

858
01:14:56,602 --> 01:14:59,071
Nice work, doctor.

859
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:01,240
Thank you, doctor.

860
01:15:02,975 --> 01:15:05,878
You know, for the record, I...

861
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:09,848
I wasn't gonna go
full Dracula on you downstairs.

862
01:15:09,982 --> 01:15:11,750
For the record...

863
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:14,853
I find him to be
quite the romantic.

864
01:15:14,987 --> 01:15:16,922
Come here.

865
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:18,924
Just close your eyes.

866
01:15:20,626 --> 01:15:21,760
Okay.

867
01:15:23,328 --> 01:15:24,763
Move closer.

868
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:54,426
Did you know the average male
body has 12 pints of blood?

869
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,429
I mean, how much do you think
the doctor can drink?

870
01:15:57,563 --> 01:15:58,864
I don't know.

871
01:15:58,997 --> 01:16:00,899
When's the last time
you had 36 beers?

872
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:03,802
When's the last time
you had any beers?

873
01:16:08,007 --> 01:16:10,108
CCTV.

874
01:16:10,242 --> 01:16:11,944
I'll go grab the footage.

875
01:16:12,077 --> 01:16:14,646
I don't want you
to have to move or anything.

876
01:16:18,417 --> 01:16:20,652
All right, check this out.

877
01:16:27,859 --> 01:16:29,227
Wait, wait, wait.

878
01:16:29,361 --> 01:16:32,698
Zoom in. And hold right there.

879
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,768
That's not the doctor.

880
01:16:36,902 --> 01:16:39,638
It's what these bloodsuckers do.
They multiply.

Milo?

897
01:17:26,752 --> 01:17:29,154
You've discovered my secret.

898
01:17:29,287 --> 01:17:31,024
I mean, look at me.

899
01:17:33,325 --> 01:17:35,527
I am reborn.

900
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:37,863
I am the resurrection.

901
01:17:39,264 --> 01:17:41,700
My God, what have you done
to yourself?

902
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:43,869
What?

903
01:17:44,003 --> 01:17:45,904
Do you disapprove?

904
01:17:46,039 --> 01:17:49,408
What's the matter, Nicholas?
Is Daddy cross?

905
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,309
All right. Settle down.

906
01:17:51,443 --> 01:17:53,079
Let's go and have
a drink together.

907
01:17:53,211 --> 01:17:54,479
Come celebrate with me, please.

908
01:17:54,613 --> 01:17:55,881
- No.
- Just one drink.

909
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:59,018
Milo, you're scaring me.
Please. Just...

910
01:17:59,152 --> 01:18:01,720
Just... Just calm down.

911
01:18:11,097 --> 01:18:14,800
- What's the matter?
- I can't... I can't sleep.

912
01:18:14,933 --> 01:18:17,869
I can help you with that.

913
01:18:18,004 --> 01:18:21,740
I've been more than a friend
to you all this time, Milo.

914
01:18:21,873 --> 01:18:24,409
And I'm going to stay here
with you.

915
01:18:26,112 --> 01:18:29,715
But there will be
no more violence, understand?

916
01:18:31,883 --> 01:18:33,819
That doesn't do it for me.

917
01:18:35,687 --> 01:18:38,423
I should have known.
You always take his side.

918
01:18:38,557 --> 01:18:40,892
Tell me your side, then, Milo.

919
01:18:41,027 --> 01:18:43,361
Michael doesn't accept
what he is, Nicholas.

920
01:18:43,495 --> 01:18:44,930
I'm gonna make him accept it.

921
01:18:45,064 --> 01:18:49,234
- By ruining his good name?
- See? There! There you are!

922
01:18:49,367 --> 01:18:53,238
Perfect Michael, selfless
Michael, Michael the favorite!

923
01:18:53,371 --> 01:18:54,940
Don't be childish, Milo!

924
01:18:55,074 --> 01:18:57,119
If anyone has a claim
to being my favorite, it's you.

925
01:18:57,143 --> 01:18:59,678
- I've devoted my life to you.
- Liar.

926
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:04,916
You pitied me before.

927
01:19:06,852 --> 01:19:10,288
You did. You pitied me before.
You're repulsed by me now.

928
01:19:10,422 --> 01:19:12,958
I am repulsed...

929
01:19:13,092 --> 01:19:14,993
by what you've done,

930
01:19:15,128 --> 01:19:17,096
by what you've become.

931
01:19:20,599 --> 01:19:24,569
Whatever this thing is...

932
01:19:24,703 --> 01:19:27,272
you're not up to it.

933
01:19:27,405 --> 01:19:29,775
There's no shame in what we are.

934
01:19:33,278 --> 01:19:35,580
"We are the few..."

935
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:39,751
"Against the many."

936
01:19:45,457 --> 01:19:47,325
Tell Michael,

937
01:19:47,459 --> 01:19:49,379
you tell him I'm going to kill
as many as I want.

938
01:20:01,306 --> 01:20:04,876
"He's only destroyed
by a stake through the heart,

939
01:20:05,011 --> 01:20:08,281
made from the wood
of the Holy Cross."

940
01:20:08,413 --> 01:20:10,348
You don't believe this.

941
01:20:10,482 --> 01:20:14,953
No. But after the week
that I've had, anything is possible.

942
01:20:16,122 --> 01:20:17,256
What is that?

943
01:20:17,389 --> 01:20:21,359
This is an antibody.

944
01:20:21,493 --> 01:20:25,831
It inhibits ferritin,
induces a massive iron overload,

945
01:20:25,964 --> 01:20:27,933
instant hemochromatosis.

946
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:32,337
Deadly to bats, fatal to humans.

947
01:20:33,438 --> 01:20:35,107
Okay.

948
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:37,043
Who's the second one for?

949
01:20:40,846 --> 01:20:43,782
My window's closing.
We both know that.

950
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:46,118
By tomorrow I'll be forced
to consume human blood.

951
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:47,686
I can't do that.
I won't do that.

952
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:49,621
So this is your solution, huh?

953
01:20:50,689 --> 01:20:52,657
Injecting yourself with poison?

954
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:55,127
I brought this into the world.

955
01:20:57,529 --> 01:20:59,298
It's up to me to take it out.

956
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:07,973
I need you to go now.
It's not safe here. Okay?

957
01:21:22,654 --> 01:21:24,923
Nicholas, you okay?

958
01:21:25,057 --> 01:21:27,893
<i>Michael, I need help.</i>

959
01:21:30,062 --> 01:21:32,964
<i>I went to see Milo.</i>

960
01:21:33,099 --> 01:21:35,268
Nicholas?

961
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,069
Nicholas!

962
01:22:00,592 --> 01:22:02,128
Nicholas.

963
01:22:05,097 --> 01:22:06,299
Nicholas?

964
01:22:09,368 --> 01:22:10,835
- Michael.
- Come on,

965
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:13,205
we have to get you
to a hospital.

966
01:22:15,707 --> 01:22:19,245
You have to stop him.

967
01:22:37,929 --> 01:22:39,398
<i>Michael.</i>

968
01:22:40,799 --> 01:22:42,968
<i>Michael.</i>

969
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:44,803
Call out for him.

970
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:48,140
I want him to hear you.

971
01:22:48,274 --> 01:22:50,109
- No.
- Yeah.

972
01:22:50,242 --> 01:22:53,346
<i>I won't ask you again.</i>

973
01:22:53,478 --> 01:22:56,349
<i>Say, "Michael."</i>

974
01:22:57,816 --> 01:22:59,251
<i>Michael.</i>

975
01:23:01,087 --> 01:23:02,787
<i>Good girl.</i>

976
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:06,025
<i>Michael.</i>

977
01:23:08,461 --> 01:23:11,297
<i>- Michael.
- Yeah.</i>

978
01:23:16,935 --> 01:23:18,670
<i>Michael.</i>

979
01:23:21,673 --> 01:23:23,175
<i>Milo.</i>

980
01:23:24,642 --> 01:23:27,046
You're hurting me.

981
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:28,713
It's okay.

982
01:24:08,487 --> 01:24:09,621
Martine?

983
01:24:11,023 --> 01:24:14,026
Let me take a look. Martine.

984
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,095
- Let me look.
- It's bad.

985
01:24:17,962 --> 01:24:19,498
Michael.

986
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:21,200
Make it mean something.

987
01:24:22,567 --> 01:24:24,270
I can help you.

988
01:24:30,242 --> 01:24:31,510
I'm sorry.

989
01:25:31,570 --> 01:25:33,005
Drank the red.

990
01:25:34,106 --> 01:25:35,374
Good for you.

991
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:39,178
It's just you and me, Michael!

992
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:41,880
Nothing, no one,
to hold us back.

993
01:25:42,014 --> 01:25:44,849
I'm all you have left.

994
01:25:44,983 --> 01:25:48,521
That's the spirit. Yeah.

995
01:26:51,617 --> 01:26:53,018
Bye.

996
01:27:32,191 --> 01:27:34,792
Come on, Michael!

997
01:27:34,926 --> 01:27:36,861
Come on!

998
01:27:36,995 --> 01:27:40,099
You can do better than this!

999
01:27:40,232 --> 01:27:42,301
It's not a curse.

1000
01:27:42,434 --> 01:27:43,736
It's a gift.

1001
01:27:43,868 --> 01:27:45,803
You started this,
you created this,

1002
01:27:45,937 --> 01:27:47,772
you created us!

1003
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,768
Michael.

1004
01:30:29,902 --> 01:30:31,470
You can't kill me.

1005
01:30:33,605 --> 01:30:35,541
I mean, it's me.

1006
01:30:37,376 --> 01:30:39,211
You can't kill me.

1007
01:30:50,955 --> 01:30:52,724
You gave me my name.

1008
01:30:54,293 --> 01:30:55,894
Remember?

1009
01:30:57,796 --> 01:30:59,565
I remember everything.

1010
01:31:02,301 --> 01:31:03,635
I'm sorry.

1011
01:31:22,721 --> 01:31:24,156
Lucian.

1012
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:05,931
- Stay back, people.
- Get back! Back!

1013
01:34:26,139 --> 01:34:29,042
Hope the food's better
in this joint.

1014

<i>The bizarre story developing</i>

1015
01:34:31,443 --> 01:34:33,245
<i>at the Manhattan
Detention Center</i>

1016
01:34:33,378 --> 01:34:36,648
<i>when a man identifying himself

1017
01:34:36,782 --> 01:34:40,053

1018
01:34:40,185 --> 01:34:41,820

1019
01:34:41,953 --> 01:34:45,457

1020
01:36:55,821 --> 01:36:58,191
Thanks for meeting me, doc.

1021
01:36:58,323 --> 01:36:59,925
I've been reading about you.

1022
01:37:00,059 --> 01:37:02,961
- I'm listening.
- I'm not sure how I got here.

1023
01:37:03,095 --> 01:37:06,032
Has to do with Spider-Man,
I think.

1024
01:37:06,165 --> 01:37:07,999
I'm still
figuring this place out,

1025
01:37:08,134 --> 01:37:11,304
but I think a bunch of guys
like us should team up.

1026
01:37:11,436 --> 01:37:13,371
Could do some good.

1027
01:37:13,505 --> 01:37:14,773
Intriguing.

1027
01:37:15,305 --> 01:38:15,793
