2
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,173
The usurper.

3
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,427
<i>Caro?</i> He's here.

4
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,200
- Professor Perlman.
- Welcome, welcome.

5
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:21,369
- Thank you so much for having me.
- Oh, my goodness.

6
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:22,912
You're bigger than your picture.

7
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:24,557
Well, I couldn't get
all of me in the photo.

8
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,332
That's the problem.

9
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,334
He seems very confident.

10
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,795
- Mrs. Perlman.
- Annella.

11
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,255
Oliver. Very nice to meet you.

12
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,816
- Thank you for having me in your home.
- Welcome.

13
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,091
Where's Elio?

14
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,634
I'll go down.

15
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:37,969
Elio?

16
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,264
- You must be exhausted.
- What gave me away?

17
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,902
Hey.

18
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,487
Darling, come help Oliver
take his things up to his room.

19
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,989
- He's already here?
- Yes!

20
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,200
Every single one of these will.

21
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,202
Elio, Oliver. Oliver, Elio.

22
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,038
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you. Elio.

23
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,831
You must be exhausted.

24
00:04:06,915 --> 00:04:09,042
- A little bit.
- Come, come, come.

25
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,877
May I bring your things up to your room?

26
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,046
- Sure. Yeah.
- My room?

27
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,091
Follow him.

28
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,344
- You're very welcome here.
<i>- Si.</i>

29
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,387
Our home is your home.

30
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,937
You're leaving?

31
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,065
- Hello.
- Hi.

32
00:04:32,941 --> 00:04:34,025
Nice to meet you.

33
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,679
My room is now your room.

34
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:04,597
I'll be next door.

35
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,895
We have to share the bathroom.

36
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,106
It's my only way out.

37
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,159
We're being called for dinner.

38
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,744
Sorry.

39
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,413
Yeah.

40
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:54,290
We're being called for dinner.

41
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,835
Yeah, I'm probably gonna pass.

42
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,588
Will you make an excuse for me
to your mom, though?

43
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,383
Thanks, man.

44
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,721
So, this is your old room, huh?

45
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,475
Thanks.

46
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,978
Later.

47
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,444
I'll take care of the tart.

48
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,992
Look at this.

49
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,410
Good morning, Professor.

50
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,953
- Good morning.
- Back from the dead.

51
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,038
- Was I out that long?
- It seemed like it, huh?

52
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:18,499
- How are you?
- I... Well, rested now.

53
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,042
- Thank you.
- I'm glad.

54
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,419
Would you like some espresso?

55
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,504
I would love some. Thank you very much.

56
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,923
This looks amazing.
I didn't take your seat, did I?

57
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:28,718
No, no, no. It's okay. Please.

58
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,761
Did you...
Did you recover from your trip?

59
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,221
I did. Yeah, big time.

60
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,015
- Thank you.
- Good.

61
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:35,683
I could show you around.

62
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,393
That'd be great. Thank you.

63
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,395
Is there a... Is there a bank in town?

64
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,772
I'd love to start
an account while I'm here.

65
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,442
Let me do it.

66
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,735
Sorry.

67
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,280
- It happens to the best of us.
- Yeah, well...

68
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,283
None of our residents has ever
had a local bank account.

69
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,826
Really?

70
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,703
Should I take him to Montodine?

71
00:08:55,786 --> 00:08:57,997
I think they're closed
for summer vacation.

72
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,458
You try Crema.

73
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,834
Crema?

74
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,419
Thank you.

75
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,087
Is this your orchard?

76
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,589
These are Annella's trees.

77
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:10,551
Peaches, cherries, apricots...

78
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:13,387
Pomegranate.

79
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,937
Have another egg.

80
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,438
Oh, stupid.

81
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,315
No, no, no. I know myself too well.

82
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:26,043
If I have a second,
I'm just gonna have a third,

83
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,987
and then a fourth, and then you're just
gonna have to roll me out of here.

84
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,989
- Delicious.
- Darling?

85
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,491
Thank you.

86
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,993
Shall I give him Anchise's bike?

87
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,116
So, what does one do around here?

88
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,827
Wait for the summer to end.

89
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,328
Yeah?

90
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:20,621
What do you do in the winter?

91
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:23,916
- Wait for summer to come?
- Well, we only come here for Christmas

92
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,584
and some other vacations.

93
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,104
- Christmas? I thought you...
- And Easter as well.

94
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,689
- Thought you were Jewish.
- Well, we are Jewish,

95
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,965
but also American, Italian, French.

96
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,301
Somewhat atypical combination.

97
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,262
Besides my family, you're probably

98
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,264
the only other Jew
to set foot in this town.

99
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,225
I'm from a small town in New England.

100
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,029
I know what it's like
to be the odd Jew out.

101
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,397
So, what do you do around here?

102
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,734
Just read books.

103
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,903
Transcribe music. Swim at the river.

104
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,655
- Yeah?
- Go out at night.

105
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,949
- I don't know.
- That sounds fun.

106
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,747
All right, buddy, thanks for the help.

107
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,507
Sorry. Sorry about that.

108
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:15,051
It's all right.

109
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:17,136
All right, later.

110
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,773
<i>What do you have there?</i>

111
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,775
That should all be...

112
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,696
What is this?

113
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,284
These are the continuation
of these archaeology department...

114
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:41,952
These are archaeology?

115
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,805
Yeah, those are archaeology.
The rest of these should be history.

116
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,914
Okay.

117
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,375
- More apricot juice?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,877
- Here, <i>tesoro.</i>
- Thank you.

119
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,337
Help yourself, darling.

120
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,713
Thanks.

121
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,306
Help yourself to some more.

122
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:07,478
The word "apricot"
comes from the Arabic.

123
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,148
It's like the words "algebra,"
"alchemy," "alcohol."

124
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,817
It derives from an Arabic noun

125
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,819
combined with the Arabic article "al"
before it.

126
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,823
The origin of our Italian <i>albicocca</i>

127
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,533
is <i>al-barquq.</i>

128
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:23,035
It's amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries,

129
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,789
the fruit's referred to
by a totally different name, <i>mismish.</i>

130
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,750
I may have to disagree
with you there, Professor.

131
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,546
I'm gonna talk etymology,
so just bear with me a second.

132
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,066
You're right in the case
that most Latin words

133
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,342
do find their origins in Greek words.

134
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,786
However, in the case of "apricot,"

135
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,696
it's a little bit more
of a complicated journey.

136
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,180
How so?

137
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,225
Well, here, the Greek actually
takes over from the Latin.

138
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,270
Latin word being
<i>praecoquum</i> or <i>precoquere.</i>

139
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:51,164
So it's, "precook" or "pre-ripen,"
as you know.

140
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,857
To be precocious or premature.

141
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,778
And the Byzantines, to go on,
then borrowed <i>praecox,</i>

142
00:12:57,862 --> 00:13:01,198
which became <i>prekokkia,</i>
which then became <i>berikokki,</i>

143
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,117
which is how the Arabs got <i>al-barquq.</i>

144
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,796
That's courtesy of Philology 101.

145
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,466
Flying colors.

146
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,762
He does this every year.

147
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:42,072
It's about drink time. Let's go here.

148
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,242
- Ciao, Romano.
- Ciao, Oliver.

149
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,912
- How are you?
- All good.

150
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,710
Ciao, boys!

151
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,629
All good?

152
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,380
All good!

153
00:13:58,464 --> 00:13:59,965
Let's see. What have we got?

154
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,885
- Can you start please?
- Of course!

155
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:24,823
Good morning, gentlemen.

156
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,872
How do you know about this place?

157
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,042
Okay.

158
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:36,877
Go, Chiara!

159
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,678
No, no, no, no, no!

160
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,222
He's better than the guy
who came last year.

161
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,682
Remember?

162
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,600
Get in there!

163
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,562
Much better!
See how cute he is.

164
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,783
Elio, water!

165
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:10,578
Perfect timing.

166
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,686
What's the matter? Are you all right?

167
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,544
- What, pinch a nerve?
- I'm okay.

168
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,546
Here. Hold this.

169
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,631
Trust me. I'm about to be a doctor.

170
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,475
Hey, hey, come here.
See? That's the problem.

171
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,801
You're too stressed.

172
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,345
- You just gotta relax a little bit.
- I am relaxing.

173
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,180
Marzia, come here for a minute.

174
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:32,641
Back me up here.

175
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:34,560
- Feel that. Right there?
- Oliver.

176
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:35,894
- It's too tight, right?
- Yeah.

177
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,187
- He needs to relax.
- Oliver!

178
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,522
Later.

179
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,065
You should relax more.

180
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,485
Okay, guys, ready?

181
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,786
Okay, our ball, our ball, our ball.

182
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,164
Twelve serving 11.

183
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:57,041
Mine, mine, mine, mine.

184
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,418
Go, go, go. Yeah, good.
It's yours, it's yours.

185
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:04,381
Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and
the others are coming over for dinner.

186
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,885
Is Oliver staying with us or going out?

187
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:09,303
Don't know.

188
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,680
What a movie star!

189
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,475
Yes, those Americans...

190
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,708
Sparkling wine!

191
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,044
He's late.

192
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,713
Don't you think...

193
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:48,717
Don't you think he's impolite
when he says, "Later"?

194
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,512
Arrogant.

195
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,931
I don't think he's arrogant.

196
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:55,182
Just watch.

197
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,601
This is how he'll say good-bye
to us when the time comes.

198
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,895
With his... "Later."

199
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:03,899
Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him
for six long weeks.

200
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,110
Won't we, darling?

201
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,529
I think he's shy.

202
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:10,280
You'll grow to like him.

203
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,444
What if I grow to hate him?

204
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,658
Oh, no, sweetheart.

205
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,454
- Take his plates away.
- Very well, madam.

206
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,626
Darling?

207
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:44,648
Elio, play something.

208
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,442
I don't want to.

209
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,485
Why not?

210
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,028
Because I don't want to.

211
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,448
Why don't you go
to Moscazzano with others?

212
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,241
Because I don't want to.

213
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,452
You're spoiling everyone's fun.

214
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,587
Play well, darling.

215
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,975
What are you doing?

217
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,268
Reading.

218
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,343
How come you're not with everyone else
down by the river?

219
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,276
- I have an allergy. It's...
- Yeah, me too.

220
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,528
Maybe we have the same one.

221
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,074
Why don't you and I go swimming?

222
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,076
- Right now?
- Yeah.

223
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,328
Come on. Let's go.

224
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,706
Do we have to go right now?

225
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,709
- I'll go get changed.
- Okay.

226
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:10,252
Meet you downstairs.

227
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,439
See you downstairs.

228
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,851
Elio, what are you doing?

229
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,519
Reading my music.

230
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,980
No, you're not.

231
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,232
- Thinking, then.
- Yeah?

232
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,737
About what?

233
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:22,783
It's private.

234
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,618
You're not gonna tell me?

235
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:26,453
I'm not gonna tell you.

236
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:28,455
He's not gonna tell me
what he's thinking about.

237
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:29,623
Elio.

238
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,375
I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.

239
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,544
More apricot juice, please.

240
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,631
That's a good boy.

241
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,257
Thank God you're helping me.

242
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,365
Sounds nice.

243
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,659
Thought you didn't like it.

244
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,041
Play it again, will you?

245
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,386
Follow me.

246
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,712
That sounds different.
Did you change it?

247
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,465
- Well, I changed it a little bit.
- Why?

248
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,633
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it

249
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:06,011
if he'd altered Bach's version.

250
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,971
Play that again.

251
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,098
- Play what again?
- The thing you played outside.

252
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,476
You want me to play
the thing I played outside?

253
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,520
- Please.
- Of course.

254
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,629
I can't believe you changed it again.

255
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:43,256
- I changed it a little bit.
- Yeah. Why?

256
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,717
I just played it the way
Busoni would've played it

257
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,302
if he'd altered Liszt's version.

258
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,363
And what is wrong with Bach
the way Bach would've played...

259
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,931
Bach never wrote it for the guitar.

260
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,349
In fact, we're not even sure

261
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,309
- Bach wrote it at all.
- Forget I asked.

262
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,466
It's young Bach.

263
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,426
He dedicated it to his brother.

264
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:03,670
Hey, Professor.

265
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:04,921
Hello.

266
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:07,132
Here, please.

267
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,800
I need help.

268
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,262
Just be honest.

269
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,555
How bad is it?

270
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,267
I think your insights here
are persuasive, but...

271
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,772
Have you been to the river?

272
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,455
Mafalda!

273
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,373
Isn't she beautiful?

274
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:01,269
Elio.

275
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,980
You sleeping?

276
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,775
I was.

277
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,527
Listen to this drivel.
Tell me what you think.

278
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,822
- Wait.
- What?

279
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,616
Can't hear you.

280
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,543
"For the early Greeks,

281
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,313
"Heidegger contends,
this underlying hiddenness

282
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,130
"is constitutive of the way beings are,

283
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,608
"not only in relation to themselves

284
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,260
"but also in relation
to other entities generally.

285
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,112
"In other words,
they do not construe hiddenness

286
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,640
"merely or primarily in terms of
entities' relations to human beings."

287
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,060
Does that make any sense to you?

288
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:44,521
Doesn't make any sense to me.

289
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,684
I don't think it makes
any sense to your dad, either.

290
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:49,609
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

291
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,409
That might be the kindest thing
anybody has said to me in months.

292
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,120
"Kind"?

293
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,205
Yep. Kind.

294
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,067
- Hey, Elio.
- Hey.

295
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,527
Hey!

296
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,531
Come here.

297
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,285
What's going on?

298
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,162
Is he trying to get it on with her?

299
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,414
Elio, he already succeeded?

300
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,751
What do I know?

301
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,502
I'd love to be in his shoes.

302
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,504
Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?

303
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:56,217
She wants him, no matter what!

304
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,638
Coming?

305
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,308
I'll come later.

306
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,595
Are you with me because
you're mad at Chiara?

307
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,346
Why would I be mad at Chiara?

308
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:08,057
Because of him.

309
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,601
Because of who?

310
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,020
Of Oliver.

311
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:24,908
Turn around.

312
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:41,382
Meet me here tomorrow night?

313
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,558
Wait for me!

314
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,185
Come on.

315
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,617
We almost had sex last night...

316
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,078
Marzia and me.

317
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,581
Well, why didn't you?

318
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,875
I don't know.

319
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,712
Well, you know, it's better
to have tried and failed, right?

320
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:23,591
All I had to do was find the courage
to reach out and touch.

321
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,218
She would have said yes.

322
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,053
Well, try again later.

323
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,930
Try what later?

324
00:31:29,013 --> 00:31:30,682
I just heard
from the people in Sirmione.

325
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:32,600
They say they've come up with something.

326
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,978
Fantastic.

327
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,604
Going there today.

328
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:39,088
- Would you like to come along?
- I would love to. Thank you.

329
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,610
- Smell this.
- Can I come, too?

330
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:45,280
On the condition you remain silent.

331
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,258
Silent as in,
"He has too many opinions,"

332
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,922
or silent as in,
"Just not telling anybody

333
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,618
"what an amazing thing you've dug up"?

334
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:52,245
Well, nothing has been dug up.

335
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:54,956
It's what has been brought out,
out of the water.

336
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,174
What are you doing?

337
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,218
Going to Lake Garda with my dad.

338
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,304
He wants to show Oliver
where he's dredging.

339
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,639
Can you tell him I came by?

340
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,475
He's inside with my dad, helping him.

341
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:19,731
You were amazing last night,
on the dance floor.

342
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,691
- He's a good dancer.
- A good dancer.

343
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,737
He's good-looking too.

344
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,990
- Want to get us together?
- No.

345
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,410
Come in.

346
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,699
Dad always sits up front
with Anchise to navigate.

347
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,751
She seems to like you a lot.

348
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,504
She's more beautiful
than she was last year.

349
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:29,384
I saw her naked on a night swim once.

350
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:31,427
Great body.

351
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,179
Trying to get me to like her?

352
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:35,348
What would be the harm in that?

353
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:36,641
No, no harm.

354
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,524
Just typically like to go at those
things on my own, if you don't mind.

355
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,941
I'll drive today!

356
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,322
Just don't play at being the good host.

357
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,619
Anchise, take the afternoon off.

358
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,456
What's going on, boys?

359
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:07,088
Oliver, come. Sit up front.
Be my navigator.

360
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,632
What? What?

361
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,858
- Dr. Roseburg.
- Samuel!

362
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,901
<i>- Benvenuto.</i>
- Look who's here.

363
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,246
- He's grown a bit, eh?
- And this is Oliver.

364
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,519
Sammy! Come on!

365
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,034
Truce?

366
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,329
Hey, boys.

367
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:32,298
The ship went down in 1827
on the way to Isola del Garda

368
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:36,511
Gossip has it this statue
was a gift from Count Lechi

369
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,764
to his lover,
contralto Adelaide Malanotte.

370
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:46,562
There are four known sets,
after the Praxiteles originals.

371
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,189
This fellow's at number three.

372
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,858
The Emperor Hadrian had a pair,
dug up at Tivoli,

373
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:54,862
but one of the more philistine
of the Farnese Popes melted them down

374
00:35:54,946 --> 00:35:58,783
and had them recast as a
particularly voluptuous Venus.

375
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,682
Who'd like to go for a swim
before we head back?

376
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:28,062
We're all such pros. If I got my own
statue, it would probably be on there.

377
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,571
Elio!

378
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:38,614
Oliver!

379
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,953
- I have to go. I have to go.
- Hey! Hey!

380
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,746
I have to go.

381
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,083
Goodness.

382
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,172
- Are you going, too?
- No, no.

383
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,341
I should stay
and do some work on my book.

384
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:00,011
Come on. How about a drink
to celebrate the day?

385
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:03,306
- Okay, maybe just one.
- All right!

386
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:16,027
Marzia?

387
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:23,636
<i>The Cosmic Fragments</i> by Heraclitus.

388
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:35,106
<i>The meaning of the river flowing
is not that all things are changing</i>

389
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:37,191
<i>so that we cannot encounter them twice,</i>

390
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:40,403
<i>but that some things
stay the same only by changing.</i>

391
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:31,037
Sorry, Elio.
I brought some clean clothes.

392
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:37,585
Leave the door open.

393
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:40,379
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

394
00:42:29,173 --> 00:42:31,091
Darling, have you seen my <i>Heptaméron?</i>

395
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,346
Mafalda.

396
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,644
It's in German.

397
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:44,897
Okay.

398
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,445
I can't remember where we left off,
but I think you'll like this one.

399
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:56,617
Come here, darling.

400
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,371
So, I'll translate, huh?

401
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,801
"A handsome young knight
is madly in love with a princess.

402
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:15,886
"And she, too, is in love with him,

403
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:20,599
"though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.

404
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:23,394
"Despite the friendship..."

405
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:28,983
"...that blossoms between them,

406
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,903
"or perhaps because of
that very friendship,

407
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:36,490
"the young knight finds himself so..."

408
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,996
"...so humbled and speechless

409
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:47,084
"that he's totally unable to bring up
the subject of his love.

410
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,672
"Till one day, he asks the princess
point-blank..."

411
00:44:03,017 --> 00:44:05,185
"Is it better to speak or to die?"

412
00:44:10,566 --> 00:44:13,610
I'd never have the courage
to ask a question like that.

413
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,447
I doubt that.

414
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,579
Hey, Elly-Belly.

415
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,541
You do know that
you can always talk to us.

416
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:37,301
My mom's been reading
this 16th-century French romance.

417
00:44:37,426 --> 00:44:39,946
She read some of it to my dad and I
the day the lights went out.

418
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:43,140
Yeah, about the knight that doesn't know
whether to speak or die?

419
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,308
Right.

420
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,977
So, does he or doesn't he?

421
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,773
"Better to speak," she said.

422
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,485
But she's on her guard.

423
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:57,780
She senses a trap somewhere.

424
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:06,038
So, does he speak?

425
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:08,374
No.

426
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,794
He fudges.

427
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:16,256
It figures. He's French.

428
00:45:22,513 --> 00:45:24,890
I gotta go to town in a little bit
to pick some things up.

429
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:28,435
I can go. I'm not doing anything today.

430
00:45:29,728 --> 00:45:31,188
Then why don't we go together?

431
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,439
Right now?

432
00:45:32,523 --> 00:45:34,733
Yeah. Right now.

433
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:38,254
That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on.

434
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:41,078
"That is, of course, unless you have
more important business going on."

435
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,020
Mind if I put this in your bag?

436
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:55,045
Yes, please.

437
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,142
I straightened the wheels
and inflated the tires.

438
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:09,643
Perfect. Thanks.

439
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:16,191
I fell. I was coming home the other day,
and I scraped myself pretty badly.

440
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:19,069
Anchise insisted on applying
some sort of witches' brew.

441
00:46:19,278 --> 00:46:20,696
I think it helped.

442
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:46,430
Hold this for a second, will you?

443
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:07,659
- Want one?
- Sure.

444
00:47:32,518 --> 00:47:33,602
Not bad, huh?

445
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,521
Not bad at all.

446
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:39,858
I thought you didn't smoke.

447
00:47:41,485 --> 00:47:42,569
I don't.

448
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,203
- So, World War II, huh?
- No. This is World War I.

449
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,555
You'd have to be at least 80 years old
to have known any of them.

450
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,668
I never even heard
of the Battle of Piave.

451
00:47:57,793 --> 00:48:00,420
Battle of Piave was one of the most
lethal battles of World War I.

452
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:02,798
Hundred and seventy thousand
people died.

453
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:06,176
Is there anything you don't know?

454
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,598
I know nothing, Oliver.

455
00:48:16,687 --> 00:48:18,414
Well, you seem to know
more than anybody else around here.

456
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:21,199
Well, if you only knew how little
I know about the things that matter.

457
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:25,487
What things that matter?

458
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:33,954
You know what things.

459
00:48:41,169 --> 00:48:42,504
Why are you telling me this?

460
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,287
'Cause I thought you should know.

461
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:51,888
Because you thought I should know?

462
00:48:54,683 --> 00:48:56,018
'Cause I wanted you to know?

463
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,565
Because I wanted you to know.

464
00:49:05,611 --> 00:49:07,279
Because I wanted you to know.

465
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,494
'Cause I wanted you to know.

466
00:49:25,422 --> 00:49:28,258
Because there's no one else
I can say this to but you.

467
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,767
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

468
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,443
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here.

469
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,529
You know I'm not going anywhere.

470
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,519
They mixed up all of my pages.

471
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:22,729
I'm gonna have to
retype this whole thing.

472
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,666
I'm not gonna have anything to work on
this afternoon.

473
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:26,233
This is gonna set me back a whole day.

474
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:28,110
Damn it.

475
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:31,321
Shouldn't have said anything.

476
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:32,781
Just pretend you never did.

477
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:35,117
Does that mean we're on speaking terms
but not really?

478
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,956
It means we can't talk
about those kinds of things.

479
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:43,333
Okay?

480
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,294
We just can't.

481
00:51:01,393 --> 00:51:02,602
Hey.

482
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:05,355
Let's go, American!

483
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:28,086
- Ready?
- Let's go.

484
00:52:03,747 --> 00:52:04,873
Pretty much.

485
00:52:13,173 --> 00:52:14,674
Oh, my God.

486
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:16,802
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

487
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:20,680
Good morning, ma'am.

488
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:23,558
Excuse me.

489
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:27,187
Could I ask for a glass of water?

490
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,199
Il Duce.

491
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,076
"People of Italy!"

492
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:43,578
That's Italy.

493
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,084
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

494
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:28,915
Come on!

495
00:53:50,937 --> 00:53:53,356
This is my spot. It's all mine.

496
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:56,693
Come here to read.

497
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,113
Can't tell you the number of books
I've read here.

498
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,201
Oh, my God, it's freezing.

499
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:07,787
Spring is in the mountains.

500
00:54:08,622 --> 00:54:10,040
The Alpi Orobie.

501
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,974
The water comes
straight down from there.

502
00:54:39,069 --> 00:54:40,946
I like the way you say things.

503
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:43,429
I don't know why you're always
putting yourself down, though.

504
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:45,659
So you won't, I guess.

505
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,998
You really that afraid of what I think?

506
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:06,608
You're making things
very difficult for me.

507
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:21,152
I love this, Oliver.

508
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,034
What?

509
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:33,498
Everything.

510
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:39,921
Us, you mean?

511
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:43,049
It's not bad.

512
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:45,176
It's not bad.

513
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:41,232
Better now?

514
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,868
No, no, no.

515
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,579
- We should go.
- Why?

516
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,957
I know myself. Okay?
And we've been good.

517
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,351
We haven't done anything
to be ashamed of,

518
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:00,668
and that's a good thing.

519
00:57:01,294 --> 00:57:02,462
I wanna be good.

520
00:57:03,213 --> 00:57:04,214
Okay?

521
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,847
Am I offending you?

522
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:20,897
Just don't.

523
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:30,198
I think it's starting to get infected.

524
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,038
We can stop by the pharmacist's
on the way back.

525
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,829
Excellent idea.

526
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:46,381
So we got the government
of Bettino Craxi...

527
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:49,008
Because we don't do anything
but talk, talk, talk.

528
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:51,010
Let me speak.

529
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:54,639
We have five parties
that do nothing but fight.

530
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,475
Smoke and shut up!
Let them speak, him, her.

531
00:57:57,684 --> 00:58:00,478
I'd like to know what they think too.

532
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:03,398
Annella, what do you think?
A five party government!

533
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:06,693
Darling, I think
it's the historic compromise...

534
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:10,864
Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.

535
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:13,741
You've changed
since you inherited this place.

536
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,535
What's that got to do with it?

537
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,412
What are you saying?

538
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:19,789
You're mad, darling.

539
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:21,833
You asshole!

540
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,795
- She's right.
- And you don't say anything to her.

541
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:28,548
Say something.

542
00:58:28,715 --> 00:58:30,341
You're resigned.

543
00:58:30,425 --> 00:58:33,011
Why don't we talk
about the death of Buñuel?

544
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:36,139
Buñuel was a genius.

545
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,849
- Know him?
- Cinema isn't the answer.

546
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:41,227
Cinema is a mirror of reality
and it's a filter.

547
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:45,023
They broadcast <i>The Phantom of Liberty</i>
with constant interr...

548
00:58:45,148 --> 00:58:47,609
Everyone loves Buñuel!

549
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:49,277
Let's hear his opinion.

550
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,821
He doesn't know anything about Italy!

551
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:53,865
Say something. Give us your impression.

552
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:55,533
Do you have an impression?

553
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:57,702
Darling, he's American.

554
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,162
That doesn't mean stupid!

555
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,212
Just stop.

556
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:11,216
I don't give an easy ride
to some politicians.

557
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:14,177
She didn't say that.

558
00:59:14,344 --> 00:59:16,179
I'm going to go mad.

559
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:18,139
What's the matter?

560
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,142
What's wrong?

561
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:23,269
It's nothing. It happens all the time.

562
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,564
- Mafalda, ice?
- It's in the fridge.

563
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:29,317
You get used to absolutely everything.

564
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,856
Don't you realize
you're mixing everything up?

565
01:00:08,982 --> 01:00:10,608
What are you talking about?

566
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:13,486
There's no more politics, nothing.
He's left too.

567
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:16,155
Elio?

568
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,202
Elio.

569
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,162
You all right?

570
01:00:24,247 --> 01:00:25,707
Sit for a second.

571
01:00:27,917 --> 01:00:29,168
If you insist.

572
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,175
- That wasn't my fault, right?
- No.

573
01:00:38,386 --> 01:00:40,013
I'm a mess.

574
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:46,102
Well, the kitchen table sure is.

575
01:00:52,025 --> 01:00:53,526
Where did you learn to do that?

576
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,946
My bubbe used to do this for us
when we were sick.

577
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,698
Trust me, it helps.

578
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,538
I used to have one of these.

579
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,206
- You used to?
- Yeah.

580
01:01:07,749 --> 01:01:09,208
How come you never wear it?

581
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:12,378
My mother says
we are Jews of discretion.

582
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,088
Well...

583
01:01:15,298 --> 01:01:17,175
I guess that works for your mother.

584
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:19,719
Funny witch.

585
01:01:25,058 --> 01:01:27,101
Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that.

586
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:29,020
I hope not.

587
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:41,032
Hey, are you leaving?

588
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:42,909
- Where's Elio?
- He's inside.

589
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:45,262
He had a bit of a nosebleed
during lunch, and he's just resting.

590
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:46,954
- Really?
- Yeah.

591
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:48,664
- Okay. Bye.
- I'll be back in a minute.

592
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:50,375
Don't go anywhere.

593
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:03,846
You okay?

594
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:12,980
Are we going out?

595
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:18,277
I don't know if I can go out.
If my mom sees, she'll worry.

596
01:02:18,403 --> 01:02:20,488
- She will?
- Yeah, she's a pain.

597
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,370
Where's Oliver?

598
01:02:27,495 --> 01:02:29,038
Don't ask me.

599
01:02:46,556 --> 01:02:47,974
Where's Oliver?

600
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:51,686
- Didn't he go out?
- Would you like a smoothie?

601
01:02:51,853 --> 01:02:54,397
No, thank you. We're having dinner soon.

602
01:02:54,522 --> 01:02:55,815
All right.

603
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,191
I'm going out tonight.

604
01:02:57,316 --> 01:03:00,611
- Don't make me worry.
- What are you talking about?

605
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,405
This is no good, madam.

606
01:03:02,530 --> 01:03:04,615
- Let him do his own thing.
- Fine.

607
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,742
Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.

608
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:08,453
She's worried about you.

609
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:15,751
You like him, don't you? Oliver?

610
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:18,588
Everyone likes Oliver.

611
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,090
I think he likes you too.

612
01:03:21,215 --> 01:03:22,467
More than you do.

613
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,971
Is that your impression?

614
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,932
- No, he told me.
- When did he say that?

615
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,310
A while ago.

616
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,086
Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?

617
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:00,671
I have no idea.

618
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,381
Traitor.

619
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:19,644
Traitor.

620
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:37,370
This is Craxi.
I draw the center of Craxi...

621
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:54,887
- Hey.
<i>- Hi!</i>

622
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,683
It's me. Is that Marzia?

623
01:06:58,808 --> 01:07:00,601
<i>Sure it is! Can't you tell?</i>

624
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:01,727
Sorry.

625
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:23,082
Is that for me?

626
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,751
Thanks.

627
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:44,645
Do you really read a lot?

628
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:47,481
I love reading too,
but I don't tell anyone.

629
01:07:48,149 --> 01:07:49,734
Why not?

630
01:07:49,859 --> 01:07:51,152
I don't know.

631
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,572
I think...

632
01:07:55,114 --> 01:07:57,616
people who read are...

633
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,368
kind of secretive.

634
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,205
They hide who they really are.

635
01:08:04,582 --> 01:08:06,417
Do you hide who you really are?

636
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,753
No, not with you.

637
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,004
Not with me?

638
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:16,260
Well, maybe a bit.

639
01:08:16,385 --> 01:08:17,803
What do you mean?

640
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,474
You know exactly what I mean.

641
01:08:21,599 --> 01:08:23,267
Why do you say that?

642
01:08:23,934 --> 01:08:25,019
Why?

643
01:08:27,313 --> 01:08:28,522
Because...

644
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,816
I think...

645
01:08:30,941 --> 01:08:32,902
you're going to hurt me,

646
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,779
and I don't want to be hurt.

647
01:08:51,712 --> 01:08:53,547
You're so hard.

648
01:08:59,887 --> 01:09:01,305
Wait.

649
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,807
Kiss me.

650
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:11,899
- Is that good?
- Yes.

651
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:14,401
Are you lying?

652
01:09:25,746 --> 01:09:28,582
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

653
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,876
Are you mad at me? Are you angry?

654
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:44,098
What's so funny? Why are you laughing?

655
01:09:44,932 --> 01:09:46,433
Leave me alone.

656
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:49,270
Fuck, that felt good.

657
01:09:57,278 --> 01:09:58,863
<i>Please don't avoid me.</i>

658
01:09:58,988 --> 01:10:01,031
<i>It kills me.
Can't stand thinking you hate me.</i>

659
01:10:01,156 --> 01:10:03,593
<i>Your silence is killing me.
I'd sooner die than know you hate me.</i>

660
01:10:03,617 --> 01:10:04,910
<i>I am such a pussy.</i>

661
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:09,456
Way over the top.

662
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,343
<i>Can't stand the silence.</i>

663
01:10:22,136 --> 01:10:23,679
<i>Need to speak to you.</i>

664
01:10:46,702 --> 01:10:48,787
Did someone have a good night
last night?

665
01:10:49,455 --> 01:10:50,664
Not really.

666
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:56,879
Well, you must be tired, then.

667
01:10:57,796 --> 01:10:59,798
Or were you playing poker, too?

668
01:10:59,924 --> 01:11:01,884
I don't play poker.

669
01:11:02,635 --> 01:11:05,155
Several hundred color slides
of our boxer and the others like him

670
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:07,056
arrived yesterday from Berlin.

671
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:09,642
We should start cataloging them.

672
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:11,477
That'll keep us busy till lunch,
I imagine.

673
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,645
Sure.

674
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:17,149
Beautiful, aren't they?

675
01:11:19,026 --> 01:11:21,403
They're all so incredibly sensual.

676
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:24,490
Because these are more Hellenistic
than 5th century Athenian.

677
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,535
Most likely sculpted
under the influence of Praxiteles.

678
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:31,246
Right.

679
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:35,876
Greatest sculptor in antiquity.

680
01:11:59,358 --> 01:12:01,568
<i>Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.</i>

681
01:12:12,204 --> 01:12:15,040
<i>Grow up. I'll see you at midnight.</i>

682
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:21,463
<i>Muscles are firm.
Look at his stomach, for example.</i>

683
01:12:21,547 --> 01:12:24,842
Not a straight body in these statues.
They're all curved.

684
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:28,429
Sometimes impossibly curved.
And so nonchalant.

685
01:12:28,971 --> 01:12:31,306
Hence their ageless ambiguity.

686
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:35,310
As if they're daring you to desire them.

687
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,207
Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir
are coming for dinner.

688
01:12:57,291 --> 01:13:00,085
- Also known as Sonny and Cher.
- Okay.

689
01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:03,398
I'd like you to wear that shirt
they gave you for your birthday.

690
01:13:03,422 --> 01:13:04,423
No.

691
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,236
- Darling, they got it for you in Miami.
- I'm sorry. It's too big. It's too big.

692
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:10,196
- Come on. It will make them so happy.
- It looks ridiculous on me.

693
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,260
I'll try it on for Oliver.

694
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:12,866
If Oliver thinks
I look like a scarecrow in it,

695
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,266
I'm not wearing it.

696
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:15,476
Oliver?

697
01:13:17,019 --> 01:13:18,562
Hey, what time you got?

698
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,773
It's 2:00.

699
01:13:24,777 --> 01:13:28,280
- Well... Later.
- Later.

700
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,794
Mafalda.

701
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,340
I won't be here for dinner.

702
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,175
Okay, Mr. Oliver.

703
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,792
Hello, Mafalda.

704
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:22,918
Marzia.

705
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:27,339
Where are we going?

706
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:28,674
You'll see.

707
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:44,898
Stop it!

708
01:17:21,013 --> 01:17:22,973
- How are you, buddy?
- Hey!

709
01:17:23,098 --> 01:17:25,058
- It's been ages.
- It has, yes.

710
01:17:25,809 --> 01:17:27,602
- How are you?
- You've grown.

711
01:17:28,145 --> 01:17:29,146
- How are you.
- I'm good.

712
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:30,439
Good to see you.

713
01:17:30,522 --> 01:17:32,524
Remember Marzia from last year.

714
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:33,692
Hello.

715
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:36,111
- Marzia, remember Isaac?
- The girl from Paris?

716
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:37,571
Good to meet you.

717
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:39,156
Want to eat with us tonight?

718
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,532
No, no. I have to go.

719
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,326
- You're sure?
- Yes.

720
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,411
- Okay.
- Have a nice evening.

721
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:45,620
Goodbye.

722
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:55,630
This right here is the brand-new china
that you guys so kindly sent to us.

723
01:17:55,714 --> 01:17:58,216
It looks wonderful.
Come here, Mounir, Mounir.

724
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,820
- Come, come, come.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

725
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:03,562
I can't put it on now.
They've already met me.

726
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,033
- Yes, you can.
- It'll look like a put-up job.

727
01:18:05,057 --> 01:18:06,058
- Papa, it'll...
- Yes.

728
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:08,977
- Papa, it'll look like a put-up job.
- No misbehaving tonight.

729
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:12,022
No... No laughing.
When I tell you to play, you'll play.

730
01:18:12,105 --> 01:18:14,608
You're too old not to accept
people for who they are.

731
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,568
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with them?

732
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:18,570
You call them Sonny and Cher
behind their backs.

733
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:21,253
- That's what Mom calls them...
- Then you accept gifts from them.

734
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:24,034
The only person that reflects badly on
is you.

735
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,745
Is it because they're gay
or because they're ridiculous?

736
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:32,000
If you know as much about economics
at Mounir's age,

737
01:18:32,084 --> 01:18:34,336
you'll be a very wise man, indeed.

738
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,089
And a credit to me.

739
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:40,175
Now, just get into this, you.

740
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:52,646
These are unbelievable. I just...

741
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,942
Hey, look who's here.

742
01:19:44,322 --> 01:19:47,409
Sorry. I have to go to bed.
I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

743
01:19:47,868 --> 01:19:48,869
Thank you.

744
01:19:50,078 --> 01:19:52,205
Elio. Elio.

745
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:55,750
- Thank you.
- Good night.

746
01:19:56,168 --> 01:19:57,502
Good night.

747
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:03,091
Do I know you?

748
01:20:21,193 --> 01:20:22,986
Thank you again for everything.

749
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:31,821
- They're never gonna make it.
- No, no. They're fine.

750
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:13,787
I'm glad you came.

751
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:26,299
Yeah, I'm nervous.

752
01:22:05,463 --> 01:22:07,023
I like what you've done with the place.

753
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,427
It's nice.

754
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:39,080
You okay?

755
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:45,754
Me okay.

756
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:14,199
- Can I kiss you?
- Yes, please.

757
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,719
What are you doing?

758
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:17,804
Nothing.

759
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:31,443
Does this make you happy?

760
01:24:33,194 --> 01:24:35,074
You're not gonna get
a nosebleed on me, are you?

761
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:36,823
I'm not gonna get...

762
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:08,563
Off, off, off, off, off.

763
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,443
Yeah. Just pull it.

764
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,155
Or I'll pull it.

765
01:25:48,436 --> 01:25:49,729
Oliver.

766
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:33,523
Call me by your name,
and I'll call you by mine.

767
01:26:37,402 --> 01:26:38,486
Elio.

768
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,532
Oliver.

769
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:46,494
Elio.

770
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,540
- Oliver.
- Elio.

771
01:27:03,678 --> 01:27:05,138
Did we make noise?

772
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:07,140
Nothing to worry about.

773
01:27:07,223 --> 01:27:09,851
I don't know.
Mafalda always looks for signs.

774
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:11,811
Well, she's not gonna find any.

775
01:27:19,527 --> 01:27:21,738
You wore that shirt
the first day you were here.

776
01:27:23,156 --> 01:27:24,699
Will you give it to me when you go?

777
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:37,438
Let's go swimming.

778
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:33,077
Are you gonna hold
what happened last night against me?

779
01:29:33,453 --> 01:29:34,537
No.

780
01:30:43,815 --> 01:30:46,109
Elio. Come here.

781
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,074
Take your trunks off.

782
01:31:08,798 --> 01:31:10,174
Well, that's promising.

783
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:11,551
You're hard again.

784
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:12,969
Good.

785
01:31:57,597 --> 01:31:59,700
Professor, I got your note.
Thank you for reminding me.

786
01:31:59,724 --> 01:32:01,577
I'm gonna go into town and pick
up those typed pages today,

787
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:03,561
so maybe this afternoon
would be a good time to...

788
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:05,813
Later.

789
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:09,992
We'll look them over later,
before you leave.

790
01:32:10,276 --> 01:32:12,904
Okay. So later.

791
01:32:13,321 --> 01:32:14,363
Later.

792
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,585
Oliver.

793
01:32:38,596 --> 01:32:39,972
You're not sick of me yet?

794
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:42,767
No, I just...
I just wanted to be with you.

795
01:32:46,187 --> 01:32:49,065
I'll... I'm gonna... I'll go.

796
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:52,651
Do you know how happy I am
that we slept together?

797
01:32:55,071 --> 01:32:56,113
I don't know.

798
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,158
Of course, you don't know.

799
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:03,246
I don't want you to regret anything.

800
01:33:03,955 --> 01:33:06,874
And I hate the thought that maybe
I may have messed you up or...

801
01:33:08,167 --> 01:33:09,311
I don't want either of us
to pay for this,

802
01:33:09,335 --> 01:33:10,575
- one way or another.
- No, I...

803
01:33:10,628 --> 01:33:12,838
It's not like
I'm gonna tell anyone.

804
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,514
You're not gonna be, like,
getting in trouble.

805
01:33:16,092 --> 01:33:17,510
That's not what I'm talking about.

806
01:33:29,647 --> 01:33:30,940
Are you happy I came here?

807
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:39,573
I would kiss you if I could.

808
01:33:51,252 --> 01:33:52,920
Times change.

809
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:54,797
Thank God we had the partisans.

810
01:33:54,964 --> 01:33:59,051
I know, but times have changed.
It's different.

811
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:01,220
What do you think of Bettino?

812
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:04,223
- I don't like him.
- I like him.

813
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:06,767
I'm happy, actually.

814
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:11,814
I don't know. We'll see.

815
01:34:14,275 --> 01:34:16,819
Anyway, they make the rules.

816
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:22,033
Pasquina!

817
01:34:22,116 --> 01:34:23,367
Hello.

818
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:24,827
Hello, ma'am.

819
01:34:25,786 --> 01:34:27,872
- Tortelli cremaschi.
- Yes.

820
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:52,790
Oh, fuck.

821
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,385
Fuck.

822
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:45,319
Fuck.

823
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:45,421
What did you do?

824
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,798
- Nothing.
- No?

825
01:38:56,348 --> 01:38:58,434
Oh, I see.

826
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:01,186
You've moved on
to the plant kingdom already.

827
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:02,479
What's next? Minerals?

828
01:39:02,605 --> 01:39:04,273
I suppose you've already
given up animals.

829
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:05,399
You know that's me.

830
01:39:06,275 --> 01:39:08,068
I'm sick, aren't I?

831
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,032
I wish everybody was as sick as you.

832
01:39:14,408 --> 01:39:15,409
Please don't do that.

833
01:39:15,492 --> 01:39:17,387
- You want to see something sick?
- Please don't do that.

834
01:39:17,411 --> 01:39:18,555
You want to see something sick?

835
01:39:18,579 --> 01:39:19,622
Please don't do this.

836
01:39:19,747 --> 01:39:20,873
Hey. Please don't do it.

837
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:27,288
Why are you doing this to me?

838
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:30,049
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

839
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:32,134
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Then don't fight.

840
01:39:55,324 --> 01:39:56,408
Sorry.

841
01:39:56,992 --> 01:39:58,035
It's okay.

842
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:05,668
It's okay.

843
01:40:18,222 --> 01:40:19,348
It's okay.

844
01:40:20,516 --> 01:40:21,975
I don't want you to go.

845
01:40:25,688 --> 01:40:28,190
God, we wasted so many days.

846
01:40:28,774 --> 01:40:29,918
Why didn't you give me a sign?

847
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:31,819
- I did. I did.
- You didn't give me a sign.

848
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:32,986
When?

849
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:35,781
You remember
when we were playing volleyball

850
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:37,658
and I touched you?

851
01:40:39,326 --> 01:40:43,038
Just to show you that I liked you?

852
01:40:43,664 --> 01:40:46,583
And the way you reacted
made me feel like I'd molested you.

853
01:40:46,667 --> 01:40:48,019
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

854
01:40:48,043 --> 01:40:50,087
I just decided
I should keep my distance.

855
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:53,298
I don't know.

856
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:59,930
I come out here for hours
almost every night.

857
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:02,433
I didn't know that.

858
01:41:05,227 --> 01:41:06,562
That's funny, I...

859
01:41:07,646 --> 01:41:08,981
I thought that...

860
01:41:09,565 --> 01:41:11,275
Yeah, I know what you thought.

861
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:13,360
Stop. Stop.

862
01:41:50,856 --> 01:41:52,191
"For Oliver.

863
01:41:53,275 --> 01:41:54,651
"From Elio."

864
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,205
Elio?

865
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:20,010
You disappeared for three days.

866
01:42:25,057 --> 01:42:26,183
I had to work.

867
01:42:27,476 --> 01:42:29,770
You completely disappeared.

868
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:33,190
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

869
01:42:36,026 --> 01:42:37,569
I had a lot to do.

870
01:42:47,621 --> 01:42:48,914
Am I your girl?

871
01:43:11,728 --> 01:43:14,648
Oliver has to go to Bergamo
for a few days.

872
01:43:14,731 --> 01:43:15,858
Oh?

873
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,526
Research at the university.

874
01:43:18,819 --> 01:43:21,530
Then he'll fly home from Linate.

875
01:43:22,573 --> 01:43:23,907
But what about Elio?

876
01:43:26,577 --> 01:43:29,162
Maybe it could be nice
for the two of them

877
01:43:29,246 --> 01:43:31,081
to get away for a couple of days, no?

878
01:43:35,419 --> 01:43:36,670
What do you think?

879
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:41,008
You know you've been
our favorite student?

880
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:43,486
- You must come back.
- You sure you're not just saying that?

881
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:45,554
- Oliver.
- Thank you very much, Professor.

882
01:43:47,514 --> 01:43:49,182
Oh, man.

883
01:43:50,976 --> 01:43:52,477
Please, please come back soon.

884
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:54,761
Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
I'm moving here.

885
01:43:56,023 --> 01:43:57,149
You're welcome.

886
01:43:58,317 --> 01:43:59,401
Oh, well...

887
01:44:00,110 --> 01:44:02,154
- Thank you guys so much.
- Of course.

888
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:03,572
Oliver, Oliver.

889
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:06,283
- Come back.
- It's been...

890
01:44:06,658 --> 01:44:07,910
Come here, come here.

891
01:44:07,993 --> 01:44:10,370
It's been amazing. Thank you guys.

892
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:13,540
Well, later, Perlmans.

893
01:44:13,624 --> 01:44:16,001
Later. Later, later, later.

894
01:44:26,053 --> 01:44:28,263
Tell Elio to call when you get there.

895
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:33,685
Oh, no.

896
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:51,954
Come for dinner tonight.

897
01:44:52,037 --> 01:44:53,288
Bring Marzia.

898
01:44:54,873 --> 01:44:56,124
Bye, darling.

899
01:45:04,174 --> 01:45:05,717
- What?
- Nothing.

900
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,135
- What?
- Nothing.

901
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:21,024
<i>Oh, to see without my eyes</i>

902
01:45:22,025 --> 01:45:26,488
<i>The first time that you kissed me</i>

903
01:45:26,571 --> 01:45:29,866
<i>Boundless by the time I cried</i>

904
01:45:31,034 --> 01:45:34,913
<i>I built your walls around me</i>

905
01:45:35,163 --> 01:45:36,164
Yes!

906
01:45:36,248 --> 01:45:38,792
<i>White noise
What an awful sound</i>

907
01:45:40,127 --> 01:45:41,211
Oliver!

908
01:45:41,878 --> 01:45:43,171
Elio!

909
01:45:43,964 --> 01:45:45,549
Elio!

910
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:52,806
<i>Hand of God, deliver me</i>

911
01:45:53,056 --> 01:45:56,852
<i>Oh, woe is me</i>

912
01:45:57,102 --> 01:45:59,563
<i>The first time that you touched me</i>

913
01:45:59,646 --> 01:46:02,399
- Oliver!
- Elio!

914
01:46:02,649 --> 01:46:05,444
<i>Oh, will wonders never cease?</i>

915
01:46:06,653 --> 01:46:11,825
<i>Blessed be the mystery of love</i>

916
01:46:24,629 --> 01:46:26,840
<i>Lord, I no longer believe</i>

917
01:46:28,467 --> 01:46:29,676
Yes!

918
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,263
<i>Drowned in living waters</i>

919
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:36,600
<i>Cursed by the love that I received</i>

920
01:46:37,851 --> 01:46:42,147
<i>From my brother's daughter</i>

921
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:45,442
<i>Like Hephaestion who died</i>

922
01:46:46,735 --> 01:46:51,156
<i>Alexander's lover</i>

923
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:55,285
<i>Now I'm prone to misery</i>

924
01:46:55,368 --> 01:46:57,496
<i>The birthmark on your...</i>

925
01:47:10,467 --> 01:47:12,719
Oh, God.

926
01:47:38,954 --> 01:47:41,873
<i>And I'm feeling low</i>

927
01:47:41,957 --> 01:47:46,962
<i>Understand I'm feeling low</i>

928
01:48:07,941 --> 01:48:09,151
You hear that?

929
01:48:10,485 --> 01:48:12,195
Wait, wait, wait.

930
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:16,199
No, no, no, it's this way.

931
01:48:16,283 --> 01:48:18,368
Come on. Come on. You're missing it.

932
01:48:19,286 --> 01:48:20,328
Come on.

933
01:48:28,003 --> 01:48:29,796
Don't stop.

934
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:32,799
<i>A kiss is not enough...</i>

935
01:48:32,883 --> 01:48:34,718
This. This.

936
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:36,344
This. You.

937
01:48:36,428 --> 01:48:37,762
You are...

938
01:48:37,846 --> 01:48:39,598
<i>Love my way</i>

939
01:48:39,681 --> 01:48:42,767
<i>It's a new road</i>

940
01:48:43,810 --> 01:48:46,188
<i>I follow...</i>

941
01:48:46,271 --> 01:48:47,772
If you'll excuse me...

942
01:48:47,898 --> 01:48:49,900
Just one second.

943
01:48:50,817 --> 01:48:52,235
One second!

944
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:56,865
<i>They'd dearly make us pay</i>

945
01:48:56,948 --> 01:49:00,410
<i>For laughing in their faces</i>

946
01:49:00,493 --> 01:49:03,622
<i>And making it our way</i>

947
01:49:03,705 --> 01:49:08,501
<i>There's emptiness behind their eyes</i>

948
01:49:08,585 --> 01:49:11,630
<i>There's dust in all their hearts</i>

949
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:13,840
I saw them last year.

950
01:49:14,674 --> 01:49:17,177
Richard Butler... fantastic!

951
01:49:17,344 --> 01:49:21,014
Really? We saw them in concert too.

952
01:49:21,097 --> 01:49:23,934
We hitchhiked to London.

953
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:26,353
What'd she say?

954
01:49:26,436 --> 01:49:29,606
<i>It's a new road</i>

955
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:32,692
<i>I follow</i>

956
01:49:32,776 --> 01:49:36,029
<i>Where my mind goes</i>

957
01:49:38,156 --> 01:49:39,991
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

958
01:51:22,093 --> 01:51:23,470
Did you get your passport?

959
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:26,723
You get your passport?

960
01:53:49,324 --> 01:53:50,533
Mafalda?

961
01:53:51,534 --> 01:53:52,660
Mom?

962
01:53:53,786 --> 01:53:55,205
Yeah, it's me.

963
01:53:56,539 --> 01:53:58,917
Yeah, everything is fine.
I'm at the station...

964
01:53:59,626 --> 01:54:00,960
in Clusone.

965
01:54:02,837 --> 01:54:04,547
Listen, Mom, can you...

966
01:54:06,174 --> 01:54:08,134
Can you come get me, Mom?

967
01:54:58,977 --> 01:55:00,061
How are you?

968
01:55:00,728 --> 01:55:01,896
Good.

969
01:55:06,859 --> 01:55:09,112
I read the book you bought me.

970
01:55:09,821 --> 01:55:11,531
The poems...

971
01:55:11,656 --> 01:55:13,157
They're really beautiful.

972
01:55:13,283 --> 01:55:16,327
I love that... Antonia Pozzi.

973
01:55:19,497 --> 01:55:21,499
I'm sorry, excuse me...

974
01:55:21,624 --> 01:55:23,334
that you're sad.

975
01:55:24,627 --> 01:55:27,547
I'm saying that because
I wanted to tell you

976
01:55:27,672 --> 01:55:29,340
I'm not mad at you.

977
01:55:30,925 --> 01:55:32,260
Not at all.

978
01:55:39,892 --> 01:55:41,185
I love you, Elio.

979
01:55:46,608 --> 01:55:47,942
Stay friends?

980
01:55:49,986 --> 01:55:51,321
For life?

981
01:55:52,113 --> 01:55:53,406
For life?

982
01:57:01,391 --> 01:57:02,600
Missed you at dinner.

983
01:57:26,749 --> 01:57:28,209
So...

984
01:57:30,002 --> 01:57:31,045
Welcome home.

985
01:57:31,546 --> 01:57:32,547
Thanks.

986
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:35,883
- Oliver enjoyed the trip?
- Yeah.

987
01:57:36,926 --> 01:57:37,969
I think he did.

988
01:57:39,345 --> 01:57:40,805
You two had a nice friendship.

989
01:57:43,099 --> 01:57:44,267
Yeah.

990
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:53,192
You're too smart not to know how rare,

991
01:57:55,695 --> 01:57:58,072
how special what you two had was.

992
01:58:00,825 --> 01:58:02,869
Oliver was Oliver.

993
01:58:06,372 --> 01:58:08,291
Because it was him.

994
01:58:09,459 --> 01:58:11,294
Because it was me.

995
01:58:11,544 --> 01:58:13,546
Oliver may be very intelligent but...

996
01:58:14,464 --> 01:58:16,048
He was more than intelligent.

997
01:58:18,259 --> 01:58:19,302
What you two had,

998
01:58:21,262 --> 01:58:24,223
had everything and nothing
to do with intelligence.

999
01:58:24,891 --> 01:58:25,975
He was good.

1000
01:58:28,311 --> 01:58:31,230
You're both lucky
to have found each other

1001
01:58:32,315 --> 01:58:33,900
because you, too, are good...

1002
01:58:41,032 --> 01:58:42,617
I think he was better than...

1003
01:58:44,577 --> 01:58:46,204
I think he was better than me.

1004
01:58:49,332 --> 01:58:51,209
I'm sure he'd say
the same thing about you.

1005
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:53,669
Yeah. He'd say the same thing.

1006
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:55,880
It flatters you both.

1007
01:58:59,884 --> 01:59:01,260
And when you least expect it,

1008
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:06,724
nature has cunning ways
of finding our weakest spot.

1009
01:59:09,477 --> 01:59:13,064
Just remember, I am here.

1010
01:59:21,072 --> 01:59:23,032
Right now,
you may not wanna feel anything,

1011
01:59:24,534 --> 01:59:26,536
maybe you never wanted to feel anything.

1012
01:59:30,373 --> 01:59:33,167
And maybe it's not to me
you'd want to speak about this things

1013
01:59:35,586 --> 01:59:38,381
but feel something you obviously did.

1014
01:59:42,677 --> 01:59:44,804
Look, you had a beautiful friendship.

1015
01:59:46,514 --> 01:59:48,015
Maybe more than a friendship.

1016
01:59:49,725 --> 01:59:51,018
And I envy you.

1017
01:59:54,188 --> 01:59:57,525
In my place, most parents would hope
the whole thing goes away.

1018
01:59:58,359 --> 02:00:00,611
Pray their sons land on their feet,

1019
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,615
but I am not such a parent.

1020
02:00:07,827 --> 02:00:11,330
We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster,

1021
02:00:12,456 --> 02:00:14,709
that we go bankrupt by the age of 30.

1022
02:00:16,419 --> 02:00:19,589
And have less to offer,
each time we start with someone new.

1023
02:00:22,133 --> 02:00:24,010
But to make yourself feel nothing

1024
02:00:25,011 --> 02:00:26,679
so as not to feel anything.

1025
02:00:28,806 --> 02:00:29,891
What a waste.

1026
02:00:37,857 --> 02:00:39,191
Have I spoken out of turn?

1027
02:00:44,196 --> 02:00:45,615
And I'll say one more thing,

1028
02:00:49,493 --> 02:00:50,703
it'll clear the air.

1029
02:00:53,706 --> 02:00:55,124
I may have come close

1030
02:00:56,667 --> 02:00:58,210
but I never had what you two have.

1031
02:01:01,172 --> 02:01:04,383
Something always held me back

1032
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:07,595
or stood in the way.

1033
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:14,685
How you live your life is your business.

1034
02:01:14,977 --> 02:01:17,521
Just remember,

1035
02:01:19,607 --> 02:01:22,860
our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once,

1036
02:01:25,988 --> 02:01:28,824
and before you know it,
your heart's worn out.

1037
02:01:29,575 --> 02:01:31,661
And as for your body,

1038
02:01:32,036 --> 02:01:34,163
there comes a point
when no one looks at it

1039
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:37,500
much less wants to come near it.

1040
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:47,468
Right now, there's sorrow, pain.

1041
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:49,345
Don't kill it,

1042
02:01:51,013 --> 02:01:53,683
and with it, the joy you felt.

1043
02:02:05,778 --> 02:02:07,154
Does Mom know?

1044
02:02:12,952 --> 02:02:14,495
I don't think she does.

1045
02:03:19,310 --> 02:03:21,896
- Have you been to the Gaverine?
- Yes.

1046
02:03:29,195 --> 02:03:30,529
Latkes.

1047
02:03:31,822 --> 02:03:33,491
- May I?
- Happy Hanukkah!

1048
02:03:33,616 --> 02:03:34,700
To you too.

1049
02:03:55,387 --> 02:03:56,847
She looks a bit weak.

1050
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:06,982
She comes highly recommended by...

1051
02:04:08,067 --> 02:04:12,071
Her special area of study is...

1052
02:04:15,491 --> 02:04:16,742
I'll get it.

1053
02:04:20,663 --> 02:04:21,664
Hello?

1054
02:04:21,747 --> 02:04:23,457
<i>Elio, you there?</i>

1055
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:26,669
- Hi.
<i>- Hey.</i>

1056
02:04:27,211 --> 02:04:29,046
- How are you.
<i>- I'm good.</i>

1057
02:04:29,713 --> 02:04:30,798
<i>I'm good. How are you?</i>

1058
02:04:30,881 --> 02:04:32,801
<i>- How are your parents?</i>
- I'm good. They're fine.

1059
02:04:33,134 --> 02:04:34,260
<i>Good.</i>

1060
02:04:36,095 --> 02:04:37,221
I miss you.

1061
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:39,807
<i>I miss you too.</i>

1062
02:04:41,058 --> 02:04:42,101
<i>Very much.</i>

1063
02:04:46,313 --> 02:04:48,983
<i>- I have some news.</i>
- News?

1064
02:04:51,819 --> 02:04:53,404
What, you're getting married?

1065
02:04:53,904 --> 02:04:55,072
I suppose.

1066
02:04:57,449 --> 02:04:59,994
<i>I might be getting married
next spring, yeah.</i>

1067
02:05:03,581 --> 02:05:05,249
You never said anything.

1068
02:05:07,376 --> 02:05:09,545
<i>Been off and on for three years.</i>

1069
02:05:13,591 --> 02:05:14,925
That's wonderful news.

1070
02:05:17,136 --> 02:05:18,262
<i>Do you mind?</i>

1071
02:05:25,603 --> 02:05:26,770
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

1072
02:05:26,854 --> 02:05:28,856
- Oliver.
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.</i>

1073
02:05:28,939 --> 02:05:30,299
Darling, when are you coming back?

1074
02:05:30,858 --> 02:05:32,151
<i>I wish I was.</i>

1075
02:05:32,484 --> 02:05:35,905
You caught us in the process of choosing
the new you for next summer.

1076
02:05:36,155 --> 02:05:38,657
- And guess what? He's a she.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

1077
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:41,452
<i>Speaking of she's, I'm calling
to tell you guys I got engaged.</i>

1078
02:05:43,412 --> 02:05:45,539
Wonderful!

1079
02:05:45,623 --> 02:05:47,499
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov!

1080
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:49,728
- Congratulations, Oliver.
<i>- Thank you, thank you, thank you.</i>

1081
02:05:49,752 --> 02:05:53,130
Listen, we'll leave you...
We'll let you speak to Elio.

1082
02:05:53,339 --> 02:05:55,424
- Happy Hanukkah!
<i>- Happy Hanukkah!</i>

1083
02:05:55,507 --> 02:05:56,634
Bye, sweetheart.

1084
02:06:04,391 --> 02:06:05,809
They know about us.

1085
02:06:07,269 --> 02:06:08,437
<i>I figured.</i>

1086
02:06:10,898 --> 02:06:12,149
How?

1087
02:06:13,901 --> 02:06:15,778
<i>Well, from the way your dad spoke to me.</i>

1088
02:06:17,196 --> 02:06:19,114
<i>He made me feel
like I was a part of the family.</i>

1089
02:06:19,698 --> 02:06:20,991
<i>Almost like a son-in-law.</i>

1090
02:06:23,202 --> 02:06:24,328
<i>You're so lucky.</i>

1091
02:06:25,913 --> 02:06:28,707
<i>My father would have carted me off
to a correctional facility.</i>

1092
02:06:31,252 --> 02:06:32,503
Elio.

1093
02:06:36,131 --> 02:06:40,177
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.

1094
02:06:43,847 --> 02:06:45,349
<i>Oliver.</i>

1095
02:06:48,227 --> 02:06:49,770
<i>I remember everything.</i>

1096
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:55,933
Elio.

1097
02:10:58,185 --> 02:10:59,186
Elio.

1098
02:11:00,305 --> 02:12:00,651
