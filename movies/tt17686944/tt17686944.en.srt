00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,516

28
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,326
You finally awake then, Turpin?

29
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:25,030
I wasn't asleep,
I was unconscious.

30
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,268
I vaguely remember you slamming
your fist into my face.

31
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,771
Must be your lucky day then
'cause here's another one.

32
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,905
(fist thumping)
(Dick grunting)

(fire crackling)

34
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,277
Now that's what
you get for trying

35
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,445
to rob the town magistrate.

36
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,884
I didn't know he
was a magistrate.

37
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,687
Well, here's the funny thing.

38
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:53,425
He's also the one that's gonna
be deciding your sentence.

39
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:57,430
He's already done your
accomplices, by the way.

40
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,765
What did they get?

41
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,434
Seven years transportation.

42
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,836
Do you know what that means?

43
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,639
They'll be separated out
up north to the islands

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,343
where they'll be doing a
little bit of hard labor.

45
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,578
You'll likely never
see 'em again, Turpin.

46
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,651
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

47
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,320
- What happened to my horse?
- Your horse?

48
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,789
She is very valuable to me.

49
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,624
Yeah, well, not as valuable

50
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,428
as she was to her actual owner.

51
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,430
A man with the name
of Major came forward

52
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,099
and claimed her last night.

53
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,835
Major was too handy with a whip.

54
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,870
She preferred to
be ridden by me.

55
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,840
Ah, did she now?

56
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:45,477
Well, perhaps we can put her
on the stand at your hearing,

57
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:49,514
say a few good words
for you (laughs).

58
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,051
I'm only joking, there's
not gonna be any hearing.

59
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,921
No point in having
a trial, Turpin,

60
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,357
not with all this damning
evidence we've got here.

61
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:03,363
(ominous music continues)
(footsteps thumping)

62
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,668
One robber's hat,
one robber's mask,

63
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,043
one robber's pistol.

64
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:25,384
So I have seven years' hard
labor to look forward to?

65
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,387
You don't look like
you'd last seven days.

66
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,056
But with you being
the leader of the gang

67
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,627
and an notorious outlaw
in your own right,

68
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,696
there's only one sentence
he could pass down.

69
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:42,568
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

70
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,407
(birds chirping)
(hooves clomping)

71
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,079
(dramatic music)
(The Earl sighing)

72
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,120
Not today, you
promised you wouldn't.

73
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,989
It's this infernal carriage.

74
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,592
Constant rocking
puts me on edge.

75
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,895
Then pay to have
the wheels repaired.

76
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,899
You know I would, only
there are other priorities.

77
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,867
You mean the kind of
priorities that come in a bottle?

78
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,069
That's not fair.

79
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,871
Well, where do you think
all these beautiful dresses

80
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,907
and jewelry come from?

81
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,742
Now, this jewelry
was my mother's

82
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,911
and this dress belonged
to cousin Charlotte.

83
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,616
She doesn't need it anymore,
not now she's married.

84
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,020
You know, it was your
mother's dearest wish

85
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,521
that you should marry well.

86
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,225
No, it wasn't, that's
your dearest wish.

87
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,760
Mother said that I
should marry for love.

88
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,930
We could afford to
be idealistic then.

89
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,500
Times have changed, Elizabeth.

90
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,936
The old estate is crumbling.

91
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,673
There's barely a skeleton staff.

92
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:59,511
If you could suitably
impress Mr. Winthroppe,

93
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,983
it might be our last chance
to hang onto Hargreave Hall.

94
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:09,888
Mister? How is it that my
father is the Earl of Pembroke,

95
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,658
yet my supposed husband
to be has no title at all?

96
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,062
He's what they call
new nouveau riche,

97
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,632
(laughs) a businessman.

98
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,567
I'm sure you'll find
him quite charming.

99
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,506
- (gentle music)
- We'll see.

100
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,508
(ominous music)
(fire crackling)

101
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,045
Beheading, they still
do that around here?

102
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,516
Not as a rule, no,

103
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,585
but there's a rather
influential local gentleman

104
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,855
who had a few words
with the magistrate,

105
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,194
persuaded him to bring the
old ax man out of retirement.

106
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,962
What local gentleman?

107
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:55,601
Somebody who wanted to make
quite sure you were dead.

108
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,136
Perhaps he's got a
grudge against ya.

109
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:02,909
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

110
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:10,550
You know the sad thing
is, if I am to be executed,

111
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:14,654
no one will find
out where I hid it.

112
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,824
- Hid what?
- The loot, of course,

113
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,761
from all the robberies,

114
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,830
Such a shame all that
money going to waste.

115
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,601
- How much money?
- Don't know.

116
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:34,606
There was so much, I never
got around to counting it.

117
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,241
We just threw it
all in a wooden box

118
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,711
with the jewelry
and gold pieces.

119
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:43,214
Buried it in the woods
not far from here.

120
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,884
- Where?
- Why should I tell you?

121
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,219
If I dug it up, it
wouldn't go a waste.

122
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,590
And what do I care if
I'm going to be executed?

123
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,693
- I can help ya.
- How?

124
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,996
- Put it a good word.
- With who, the executioner?

125
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,332
Don't knock it, Turpin.

126
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,766
It can be the difference

127
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,203
between a single clean
slice through the neck

128
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,871
or a botched hacking
around the shoulders

129
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,175
that could go on for hours.

130
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,912
Now that old man, he's very old.

131
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,751
Could take him a good few
swings to get the job done

132
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,386
if I don't give
him a hand with it.

133
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,389
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

134
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,662
(birds chirping)
(hooves clomping)

135
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,397
[The Earl] What's
that you're reading?

136
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:37,669
- (book thumping)
- Just some poetry.

137
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,838
So how did Mr. Winthroppe
come to acquire his wealth

138
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,107
if he wasn't born into it?

139
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,242
I'm a little hazy
about the details,

140
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,279
but I understand it's
about investing in land

141
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,749
and then digging up coal.

142
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,317
He's a manual laborer?

143
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,253
No, no, he doesn't
dig it up himself.

144
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:57,956
He owns a mine, Elizabeth.

145
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,192
He employs dozens of people.

146
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,829
We used to employ
dozens of people.

147
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,335
And we will again, as long
as you play your cards right.

148
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:14,707
- (fire crackling)
- Well?

149
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,177
- All right, I'll tell you.
- (ominous music)

150
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,445
Well, come closer.

151
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,680
You don't want anyone
outside these four walls

152
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,881
to hear, do you?

153
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:27,453
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

154
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,059
(footsteps thumping)

155
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,698
Closer, I want to
whisper in your ear.

156
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,869
(ominous music continues)
Closer.

157
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,709
(ominous music continues)

158
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:54,813
(keys rattling)
(ominous music continues)

159
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,783
(dramatic music)

160
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:04,356
(keys rattling)
(dramatic music continues)

161
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:10,396
(footsteps thumping)
(Turnip panting)

162
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,100
Oh, oh, damn, I need
to find a horse.

163
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:21,440
(ominous music)
(door rattling)

164
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,945
- Very nice.
- (dramatic music)

165
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,214
It's hardly Hargreave hall.

166
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,381
Of course it isn't.

167
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:32,817
They don't build houses
like that anymore.

168
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:36,087
This is brand new,
commissioned and built

169
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,490
to Winthroppe's own design.

170
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,225
And around the back,

171
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,964
there are great tracts of land
all the way down to the mine.

172
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,768
I tell you, Winthroppe
is a man of means.

173
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,903
Remember to flutter
your eyelashes.

174
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:57,143
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps thumping)

175
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,112
Most of the coal extraction
going on in England today

176
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,184
is horribly primitive,
pits of only 50 feet deep

177
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,987
with no supporting
structure at all.

178
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,889
Very dangerous for the workers.

179
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,459
- I see.
- There was an incident

180
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,263
in Wales just over a year ago,

181
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,999
where there was
a huge explosion,

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,371
which took down an entire
shaft, trapping a dozen men.

183
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,543
And the worst of it was,
they were still alive.

184
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,479
They could be heard
tapping on their helmets,

185
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,949
trying to get a message
out from the rubble.

186
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,051
Nothing could be
done, of course.

187
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,288
Went on for days, apparently.

188
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:48,027
But that's why I insist in
the highest safety standards.

189
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,164
My shaft is the
longest in the country.

190
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:57,836
It goes deeper than anyone
else's, over 200 feet deep.

191
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,573
Hear that, Elizabeth, 200 feet?

192
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,143
And might a man breathe
the air that far down?

193
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,446
Well, with our patented
air pumping system, he can.

194
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:11,517
Fascinating, and
what do people do

195
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,453
with all this coal
you're digging up?

196
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:19,290
Why aren't you mining
for gold or silver?

197
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,260
- They burn it.
- [The Earl] Hmm?

198
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,863
Answer me this,
sir, if you will,

199
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,400
how much firewood does it
take to heat up Hargreave Hall

200
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,635
during the winter months?

201
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:34,873
(sighs) Half of
forest, it seems.

202
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,142
This house was built
with a coal cellar,

203
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:42,247
a room no bigger than
this, beneath our feet.

204
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:47,119
The coal in that cellar will
heat up this entire property

205
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,387
from October to March.

206
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,589
- Extraordinary.
- You must allow me

207
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,324
to give you a tour
of the mine someday.

208
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,561
That will be marvelous.

209
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,399
Tell me, this mine of
yours, what kind of income

210
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:06,472
might a set up like this
generate on an annual basis?

211
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,475
More than enough to keep
a young lady in a manner

212
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:14,545
to which she is accustomed,
I can assure you.

213
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,149
And what about an old man?

214
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,686
Well, my business
manager, Mr. Arkwright,

215
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:25,023
is as we speak
writing up a contract,

216
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,693
which I'm sure will
allay all your concerns.

217
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,597
Contract, what sort of contract?

218
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,132
A marriage contract.

219
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,402
(dramatic music continues)
(tree creaking)

220
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,504
(birds chirping)
(gravel crunching)

221
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:43,574
Did you hear that,
Elizabeth? A marriage contract!

222
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,077
- You did it.
- I don't know what I did.

223
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,046
He barely gave me
a passing glance.

224
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,114
Well, obviously, he's
too much of a gentleman

225
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,650
to talk to you directly
until after the marriage.

226
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,552
It's a sign of good breeding.

227
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,120
He seemed far more interested

228
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,522
in talking business with you.

229
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,224
That's another good sign.

230
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,429
I must have a good look
at this proposal of his.

231
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,132
I'm expecting a large
stake in that mine.

232
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,469
He's not getting his hands on
my only daughter for nothing.

233
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,104
Getting his hands on me?

234
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,473
Ugh, you make it
sound awfully tawdry.

235
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,608
And I haven't agreed
to anything yet.

236
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,144
(gentle music)
(tree squeaking)

237
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,280
An opportunity like this
will not come along again,

238
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,550
Elizabeth, not at your age.

239
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,621
Is Hargreave Hall
really at risk?

240
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,290
Well, I didn't
want to say anything,

241
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,228
but the East wing has
already been stripped.

242
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:41,632
Paintings, furniture,
anything of value, gone.

243
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,035
But that's where I grew up.

244
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:48,339
All my childhood memories
are of the East wing.

245
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,142
So now you can see how
important this marriage is.

246
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,779
(gentle music continues)
(birds chirping)

247
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,649
(hooves clomping)

248
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,320
Well, I will admit he's
not completely unattractive.

249
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,023
That's the spirit.

250
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,657
I tell you, he'd make
an excellent suitor.

251
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:11,230
He's tall, he's wealthy,
he's got huge tracts of land.

252
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,433
(ominous music)
(leaves crunching)

253
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:20,305
(hooves clomping)
(dramatic music)

254
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,211
It's all happening
terribly fast.

255
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,479
At this rate, you'll
have me married off

256
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,814
by the end of the week.

257
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,517
We can but hope (laughs).

258
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:36,622
(dramatic music continues)
(hooves clomping)

259
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,527
[Dick] Stand and deliver.

260
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,696
(horse neighing)
(dramatic music continues)

261
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,098
Your money or your life.

262
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,667
What the devil's
going on out there?

263
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,403
[Dick] You in the
carriage, show yourselves.

264
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,604
(door rattling)

265
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:58,209
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

266
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,812
(gravel crunching)

267
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,713
And who might you be, sir?

268
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,616
Who are you to ask who
I am, standing there,

269
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:09,220
blocking the road, making
demands with menaces?

270
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:13,724
Now the question is, sir,
who the devil are you?

271
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,561
[Dick] My name, sir, is Turpin.

272
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,764
Perhaps you've heard of
me and my notorious gang.

273
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,232
I heard you'd been arrested.

274
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,735
[Dick] No jail can hold me, sir,

275
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,572
or my gang, who
are at this moment

276
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:31,576
in the trees surrounding
your carriage.

277
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,879
And I must warn you, they are
all armed and prepared to die.

278
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,249
Well, I am the Earl of Pembroke.

279
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,817
And if you have any
sense of decency,

280
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,587
sir, you'll stand side.

281
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,789
[Dick] The Earl of Pembroke?

282
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,192
That sounds impressive,
you must be very wealthy.

283
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:52,764
My financial standing,
sir, is no business of yours.

284
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,701
[Dick] I'm making
it my business.

285
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,569
Now hand over whatever
items of value you have

286
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,471
in that carriage.

287
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,508
We are not carrying
any items of values, sir.

288
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,744
[Dick] Really? The Earl of
Pembroke travels the country

289
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,280
without a penny in his pocket?

290
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,551
Being an Earl isn't
what it was, sir.

291
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,523
[Dick] There must be
something worth having in there.

292
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,692
Daddy, who are you talking to?

293
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,295
Elizabeth, get back inside.

294
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,397
[Dick] Well, well, I
thought you said there

295
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,933
was nothing of value
in that carriage.

296
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,802
Sir, sir, she's
my only daughter.

297
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,404
[Dick] Relax, your earlship.

298
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,274
I was talking
about the necklace.

299
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,176
Elizabeth, is it?

300
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,311
- Come over here.
- Elizabeth, it's Turpin,

301
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,481
the famous outlaw (chuckles).

302
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,950
Don't let him lay
a finger on you.

303
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,420
You're betrothed, remember?

304
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,691
[Dick] That's it, come along.

305
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,326
My gang don't want
to be kept waiting.

306
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:58,196
(gentle music)
(footsteps thumping)

307
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,331
Are you sure you've got a gang?

308
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,833
[Dick] They're out
there in the trees.

309
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,502
Even now, they have
their pistols trained

310
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,836
on you and your father.

311
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,638
Now come along, hand
over the necklace.

312
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,240
I can't see anyone.

313
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:12,510
Just give me the necklace.

314
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,644
(book thumping)

315
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:18,383
(gentle music continues)
(birds chirping)

316
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,419
I do believe you're bluffing.

317
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,288
He's bluffing, Daddy,
he hasn't got a gang.

318
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,625
[Dick] Right, that's
it, nobody move.

319
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,726
You've really gone and
bloody done it now.

320
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,694
You're in big trouble.

321
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,395
Now, Turpin, don't be hasty.

322
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,731
[Dick] The young
lady is coming with me,

323
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:38,303
and if any of you move an
inch in the next 10 minutes,

324
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,738
my gang will let you have it.

325
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:45,577
(dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

326
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,317
How dare you lay a hand on me.

327
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,255
I am sorry, your ladyship,
I didn't plan it this way.

328
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,458
Where are you taking me?

329
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,760
I don't know, I'm
making this up as I go.

330
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,833
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

331
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,902
(dramatic music)
(door squeaking)

332
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,739
- (footsteps thumping)
- Ah, Mr. Arkwright,

333
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,908
just the man, is the marriage
contract drawn up yet?

334
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,744
Yes, sir, I have it here.

335
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,580
Complete with all the
special clauses I requested?

336
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,283
- Yes, of course, but I must...
- Excellent.

337
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,450
Leave it on the table

338
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,918
and I'll have a message
sent to the Earl,

339
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,488
inviting him back at
his soonest convenience.

340
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,023
Please, Mr. Winthroppe, sir,

341
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:36,294
I must talk to you about
this land survey report.

342
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,296
It's as I feared.

343
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,598
- [Henry] Let me see.
- (tree squeaking)

344
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,501
The men dug test
pits every 200 yards

345
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,003
in a circular formation.

346
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,606
- What did they find?
- Nothing.

347
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,941
(ominous music)

348
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:54,345
Nothing, they
found no coal at all?

349
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,615
Not a bit of it, I'm afraid.

350
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,785
It appears that the coal
seam that you found initially

351
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,022
was what they call an
outlier, a one-off.

352
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,894
There's nothing else like
it in a surrounding area.

353
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,364
This is quite unusual really.

354
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,967
I spent 100 pounds
on that survey.

355
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:17,968
And all the land I purchased?

356
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,871
Largely worthless, I'm afraid.

357
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:24,675
I suppose you could rear
cattle on it, except.

358
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,611
- Except what?
- The land's covered

359
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,947
in dangerous pits now.

360
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,918
You'd be forever dragging
the animals out of the holes.

361
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,353
You could spend
another 100 pounds

362
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,021
to have the holes
filled in, I suppose.

363
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,490
How could it cost the
same amount filling them in

364
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,424
as to dig them out?

365
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:41,826
Surely it's half the work.

366
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,663
Well, that's a question
for the surveyors.

367
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,365
But I'm afraid, what with this

368
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,768
and the situation with the
mine, well, that leaves you

369
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,439
in a bit of a precarious
situation, I think.

370
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,378
How about the other survey?

371
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,915
Ah, now, well, that
tip certainly paid off.

372
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,984
As good as we hoped?

373
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,053
Better, it's astonishing
what people have

374
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,856
in their possession and have
no idea that they've got it.

375
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,625
Then we're fine,

376
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:18,662
as long as this marriage
contract of yours stands up.

377
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:22,566
Well, it will, once
there's a signature on it.

378
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,668
Leave that with me.

379
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,105
But sir, what
about the situation

380
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,541
- with the mine?
- Yes?

381
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,412
Well, there's barely
any coal left to extract.

382
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,747
Tell them to dig
deeper, another 10 feet.

383
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,048
Well, the last 10 feet
didn't really reveal anything.

384
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,751
I don't care.

385
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,722
I just need to keep up the
appearance of business as usual.

386
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,724
I don't need to tell you

387
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:48,993
how many loans I took
out against that mine

388
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,128
for all that bloody
worthless land.

389
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,698
No, of course, sir, did you...?

390
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,036
Were you aware the
mine was in trouble

391
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,739
when you took those loans out?

392
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,675
And what if I was?

393
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:08,078
I would have recommended
strongly against it.

394
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,183
It could be seen as
deliberate fraud.

395
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,022
Mm, and whose signature
is at the bottom

396
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:23,160
of all those loan
agreements. Mr. Arkwright?

397
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,929
Well, it's mine.

398
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,730
- Thank you, Mr.
- Arkwright, good day.

399
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,600
I was signing on your behalf.

400
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,901
(laughs) I do it all the time.

401
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,473
- Good day.
- (gentle music)

402
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:40,946
(paper rustling)
(footsteps thumping)

403
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,950
(birds chirping)
(tree creaking)

404
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,253
Do either of you two have
some sort of time piece?

405
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,255
Just wondering if 10
minutes has passed yet.

406
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,658
(birds chirping)

407
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,796
- (footsteps thumping)
- Ow!

408
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,198
You don't exactly
blend in, do you?

409
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,900
What do you mean?

410
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:06,670
- [Dick] That dress.
- It was rather intended

411
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,938
to make me stand out.

412
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,107
I can see that.

413
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:12,743
I'm afraid it's the last
thing we need right now.

414
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,978
How long do you think
it'll be before your father

415
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,680
has people out combing
the woods for us?

416
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,116
Come on.
(tree squeaking)

417
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:24,189
(mischievous music)
(tree creaking)

418
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,892
That's it, turn us around,
straight back to Winthroppe's.

419
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,627
He'll know what to do.

420
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,162
(mischievous music continues)
(leaves rustling)

421
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,699
- Shh.
- What are you doing?

422
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,035
- Stealing this.
- Is that all you know

423
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,970
how to do, steal things?

424
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:42,706
All right, I'm borrowing it.

425
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,175
Haven't you ever borrowed
anything, your ladyship?

426
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,144
This dress is
borrowed from my cousin.

427
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,979
Well, there you are then.

428
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,148
I promise I'll give it back
when I'm out of trouble.

429
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:54,618
Are you ever out of trouble?

430
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,886
Occasionally, come on.

431
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,556
(mischievous music continues)
(birds chirping)

432
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,858
(dramatic music)
(hooves thumping)

433
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:05,162
- Winthroppe!
- (dramatic music continues)

434
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,198
- This is appalling.
- Turpin, did you say?

435
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,901
Yes, he's a well known outlaw.

436
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,238
Yes, I'm very well aware
of his nefarious activities.

437
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,906
In fact, I thought
he was in jail.

438
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,875
Well, apparently, he's free

439
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:22,346
and he's graduated from
burglary to kidnapping.

440
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:26,884
Don't worry, we'll get
Elizabeth back. O'Reilly.

441
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,887
(door rattling)
(door squeaking)

442
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:34,258
He works for me in
various capacities.

443
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,629
To take you back to where
the kidnapping took place.

444
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,230
You'll know what
to do from there.

445
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,665
- Yes, sir.
- (birds chirping)

446
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:46,338
(ominous music)
(footsteps thumping)

447
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:50,941
(leaves rustling)
(birds chirping)

448
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,643
Here, put this on.

449
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:56,146
That thing, ugh, it's probably
infested with something.

450
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,916
Come along, your ladyship,
we haven't got all day.

451
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,819
And in any case, you
should hardly expect me

452
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,254
to change my dress out here
in the middle of the forest.

453
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:07,057
Oh, for the love of, you know,

454
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,392
you're almost more
trouble than you're worth.

455
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,094
And what am I worth?

456
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,262
Well, I recently lost the
use of an excellent horse.

457
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,633
A horse. So what do you
propose to do, ride on me?

458
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,102
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

459
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,704
What I propose to do
is to request a ransom

460
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,940
from your father for
your safe return.

461
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,276
I'm sure the Earl of Pembroke
keeps an excellent stable.

462
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,712
He used to, not anymore.

463
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,415
(mischievous music)
(tree squeaking)

464
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:35,786
(ominous music)
(horse neighing)

465
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,820
He must have some money,

466
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,323
- at least.
- Not really.

467
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,291
Well, surely it takes a
considerable income just

468
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,793
to maintain such a large estate.

469
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:47,866
(ominous music continues)
(birds chirping)

470
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,869
He started selling
off family heirlooms.

471
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,838
I'd be absolutely distraught
if we lost Hargreave Hall.

472
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,376
Oh, bugger me, I know
how to pick 'em, don't I?

473
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,244
I must have the daughter
of the only earl

474
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,113
in England who's flat broke.

475
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,148
You'd have been
better off waiting

476
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,283
- until I was married.
- Yes?

477
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,085
(ominous music continues)
(birds chirping)

478
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,154
[O'Reilly] Turpin,
give me the girl.

479
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,456
- (dramatic music)
- Who's that,

480
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,124
someone who works
for your father?

481
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,693
I have no idea.

482
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,095
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

483
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:21,199
(leaves rustling)

484
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,969
Let's make a deal,
for her safe return,

485
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,406
I want a good horse
and 50 gold sovereigns.

486
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,974
(gun firing)

487
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,878
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

488
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,981
Okay, I'll take the horse
and 20 gold sovereigns.

489
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,717
(gun firing)

490
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,018
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

491
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,021
Okay, just the horse,
I'll just take the horse.

492
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:46,824
[O'Reilly] You'll get
nothing, give me the girl.

493
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,359
And then we'll say
no more about it?

494
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,229
[O'Reilly] No, then
I'll take your head.

495
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,864
That's what I thought.

496
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,099
(dramatic music continues)
(leaves rustling)

497
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,734
Come on, let's go.

498
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,204
Not right now, I afraid
he's got us outgunned.

499
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,371
We need to find somewhere
to hole up for the night.

500
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:02,773
It'll be dark soon, come on.

501
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:07,512
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

502
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:23,094
(fire crackling)
(liquid sloshing)

503
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,500
Here, this will
steady the nerves.

504
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,237
- Ah, perfect.
- Now, there's no need

505
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,105
to be too concerned.

506
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,941
My man O'Reilly never fails me.

507
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,510
What did you say
his line of work was?

508
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,545
A little bit of
everything, really.

509
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:46,416
Especially the things one
wishes to be done discreetly.

510
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,820
- I see.
- Now, if you'd like

511
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,422
to take a seat at the table,

512
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,291
as luck would have it,

513
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,794
the marriage contract is
ready for your perusal.

514
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:01,466
(gentle music)
(rain splattering)

515
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,968
(door creaking)

516
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,004
Well, this will
do for the night.

517
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,574
It most certainly will not.

518
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,544
Wait, what are you doing?

519
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,245
I'm sorry, your ladyship.

520
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,915
- Don't you dare.
- I have to protect my assets.

521
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,319
- [Elizabeth] Ow!
- Sorry, what's this book?

522
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,087
Can you even read?

523
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,323
Of course I can read.

524
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,591
Just don't have
the time right now.

525
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,959
Now where are you going?

526
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,061
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

527
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,262
To get some essentials.

528
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:34,431
But you can't just
leave me here like this.

529
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,567
Don't worry, I'll be back.

530
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,535
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

531
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,405
(door rattling)
(thunder rumbling)

532
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:46,411
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

533
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,013
Does it say 50%?

534
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,215
Yes, that's right.

535
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,584
Once Elizabeth
and I are married,

536
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:58,255
50% of all profits from the
mine will be made over to you.

537
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:00,524
That's very generous.

538
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,160
Nothing's too good for
my future father-in-law.

539
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:06,029
And what's this
about Hargreave Hall?

540
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,566
Well, the hall and
the surrounding estate

541
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,637
will be made over
to my stewardship.

542
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,508
- Stewardship?
- Well, think on this,

543
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,012
in your later years, do
you really want be burdened

544
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,049
with maintaining
such a vast building?

545
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,519
Not to mention all the
land and the gardens.

546
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,121
You'd take care of all that?

547
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,523
Well, I could so
long as the estate

548
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,060
was under my stewardship.

549
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:41,565
Do you have an ink
pen to hand, sir?

550
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,234
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

551
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,536
(door rattling)

552
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,338
Good evening, your ladyship.

553
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,606
(goblet rattling)

554
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,377
- Where have you been?
- (match crackling)

555
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,179
I went back to that
little shack in the woods.

556
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:00,584
There was no one home, so I
borrowed a few essentials.

557
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,186
I thought you might be
hungry, so I brought dinner.

558
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,055
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

559
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,557
I'm not hungry.

560
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:12,062
This isn't so you can
eat, it's so you can change.

561
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,231
I told you I'm not wearing that.

562
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:17,067
It's clean, I stole it off
a washing line, remember?

563
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:21,638
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

564
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,941
You stick out a
mile in that dress

565
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,242
and I'm afraid it's
not a risk I'm prepared

566
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,312
to take a moment longer.

567
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,981
I'm afraid I really must insist.

568
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,684
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

569
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,086
If you were a gentleman,
you'd turn your back.

570
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:40,024
I'm an outlaw, not a
gentleman, but still.

571
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:45,462
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

572
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,598
What kind of an
occupation is that anyway?

573
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,568
[Dick] Outlaw? I do all right.

574
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,637
Spending the night
in smelly barns,

575
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,073
is that what you
consider doing all right?

576
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,641
I'm sorry if the accommodation

577
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,177
isn't up to your usual
standards, your ladyship.

578
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,379
Will you stop calling me that?

579
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,748
[Dick] What, your ladyship?

580
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,650
I am not a lady.

581
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,253
(dramatic music)
(rain splattering)

582
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,588
You could have fooled me.

583
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,323
Stop gawking at me.

584
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,126
(dramatic music continues)
(rain splattering)

585
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,596
I meant I do not hold
the title of a lady.

586
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,298
How do you get that then?

587
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,066
You marry a lord.

588
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,468
Well, never mind,
I'm sure you will.

589
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:28,071
(dramatic music continues)
(rain splattering)

590
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,074
Didn't you say something
about getting married?

591
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,343
That is none of your business.

592
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,146
You don't sound
too happy about it.

593
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,248
Isn't he a lord, then?

594
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,485
I told you that is
none your business.

595
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,053
Wait a minute, you said

596
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:46,156
that I'd be better off
waiting 'til you got married.

597
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,227
- What did you mean by that?
- Nothing.

598
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,030
He's got money,
hasn't he, your fiance?

599
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,333
That's what you
meant, is it a lord?

600
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,335
- No.
- Or a duke?

601
00:33:58,336 --> 00:33:59,770
- No.
- Not a prince.

602
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,305
No, he isn't anything,

603
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,042
just some nouveau riche upstart
named Winthroppe (sighs).

604
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,612
(dramatic music continues)
(rain splattering)

605
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:09,813
Winthroppe?

606
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:14,519
(gentle music)
(rain splattering)

607
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,693
Well, it all seems satisfactory.

608
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:28,265
(ominous music)
(rain splattering)

609
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,535
Mind you (chuckles),
I must warn you,

610
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,371
Elizabeth can be a
feisty young thing.

611
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,606
You're gonna have your work
cut out, that's for certain.

612
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:39,242
I've never been one to back
away from a challenge, sir.

613
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:43,346
(thunder droning)
(rain splattering)

614
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,749
How did you
acquire your fortune?

615
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,418
Must have taken quite a bit of
capital, purchasing the land,

616
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,120
setting up the mine
in the first place.

617
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,589
Well, I've always been involved

618
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,662
in one form of business or
another, ever since I was a boy.

619
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,630
I've always been just
a little bit better

620
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,099
at it than everyone else.

621
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,269
Hmm, you parents must
be very proud of you.

622
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,638
Will they be
attending the wedding?

623
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,540
No, I'm afraid not.

624
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,577
They both passed
away some time ago.

625
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,648
- Oh.
- (ominous music continues)

626
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:22,119
- Aunts, uncles, cousins?
- Nope.

627
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,190
- Shame.
- (ominous music continues)

628
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,796
You know, I adore
Elizabeth, but well,

629
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:35,332
sometimes I do wish he
had a younger brother,

630
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:40,137
a young man who might make
his own way in the world,

631
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,306
achieve something
to be proud of.

632
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,474
The trouble with daughters

633
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,712
is they just sit
there, looking pretty.

634
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,549
Well, you know what
they say about a marriage,

635
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,155
it's not so much losing a
daughter, but gaining a son.

636
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,190
Just your signature
at the bottom.

637
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:05,329
(rain splattering)
(ominous music continues)

638
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,797
- Shouldn't we have a witness?
- What?

639
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,234
- To the signature?
- Well.

640
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,703
(door squeaking)
(ominous music continues)

641
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,306
Ah, O'Reilly, perfect timing.

642
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,475
Would you please witness
the earl's signature?

643
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,444
Well, wait a minute,
what about Turpin?

644
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,780
Gave me the slip,
I have a fair idea

645
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:24,948
where they're headed, though.

646
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,851
You see, everything
is under control.

647
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:31,656
As I've always said,
O'Reilly never fails me.

648
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,326
Please, just your
signature, if you will.

649
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:40,531
- Mm, oh.
- (ominous music continues)

650
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:47,671
To tell you about Winthroppe.

651
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,340
What would a man
like you know of him?

652
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,976
More than you seem to.

653
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,879
He's 10 times the
thief I'll ever be.

654
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,414
Are you sure you're not jealous?

655
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,750
- Jealous?
- Yes, why not?

656
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:05,322
He's wealthy, successful,
not to mention handsome.

657
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,824
I found him quite impressive.

658
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,526
You don't know him
very well at all, do you?

659
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,994
For your information, I happen

660
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:13,730
to have spent several
hours in his company.

661
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,266
Several hours (laughs),

662
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,968
and that's enough to
decide to marry him?

663
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,838
You have no idea how society
marriages work, do you?

664
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,540
You're such a peasant, Turpin.

665
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,474
Call me Dick.

666
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,577
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

667
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:32,650
Listen, I'm trying to tell
you something important.

668
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,419
I wasn't always an
outlaw, you know?

669
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,887
What were you before?

670
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,389
A butcher's apprentice.

671
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,325
Oh, so you know how to
carve up a dead animal?

672
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,396
When I was a
butcher's apprentice,

673
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,299
this group of lads
started coming to the shop

674
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,303
with deer carcasses
they wanted to sell.

675
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,905
So I didn't think
anything of it.

676
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,475
(gentle music)
(straw rustling)

677
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:02,747
It was all fine, until
one night, these lads came

678
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,283
and said they were a man short

679
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,918
and they needed my
help hunting the deer.

680
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,421
Is it normal to
hunt deer at night?

681
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,724
No, but I didn't know that.

682
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,895
It turns out they
were poaching the deer

683
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,632
from the royal
forest at Waltham.

684
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,700
By the time we got
there that night,

685
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,970
it was too late to back out.

686
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,071
And by the end of that night,

687
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,007
I was as guilty as
the rest of them.

688
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,442
The trouble was it

689
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,413
wasn't just poaching
they were getting up to.

690
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,016
Soon enough, it was
horse theft and burglary.

691
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,851
I knew you were a scoundrel.

692
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,322
I was a boy, not even 20.

693
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,927
And there was another
young lad in the group,

694
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,095
even younger than I was.

695
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,831
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

696
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,368
And believe it or not,
he was the ringleader,

697
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,638
probably because he
was the most ruthless.

698
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,809
Always carried a dagger
strapped to his back.

699
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,679
Anyway, it all fell
to pieces one night

700
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,581
when we were caught during
a burglary in Hampshire,

701
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,782
when an old man was killed.

702
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,752
Killed, who did it?

703
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,689
I don't know, I
was in another part

704
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,826
of the house at the time.

705
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,094
I have my suspicions.

706
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:28,098
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

707
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,699
Anyway, once we
were all in jail,

708
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,436
this young lad pretended
that we'd forced him into it,

709
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:34,871
ratted us all out

710
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:39,477
and gave up a huge stash of
loot we had hidden in the woods.

711
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,812
Probably because he was
barely old enough to shave,

712
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,381
they believed him.

713
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:48,685
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

714
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,621
We all got sentenced
to the noose

715
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,556
and he got a bloody reward.

716
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:58,429
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

717
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,832
And do you know what
that rat's name was?

718
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,735
- Not Winthroppe.
- No.

719
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:10,974
People called Winthroppe
don't go around poaching deer.

720
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,042
This lad's name was Jack Jones.

721
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,878
Then why are you
telling me this?

722
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,680
Because after the trial,

723
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:22,753
this young lad took his
reward money and disappeared.

724
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:25,121
I heard a rumor that he'd moved
to this part of the country

725
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,724
and bought himself
a piece of land,

726
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,726
tried to reinvent himself
as a bit of a gentleman.

727
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,896
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

728
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,800
I never had any proof,
but I thought seeing

729
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,669
as me and my gang
were in the area,

730
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,870
I'd have a little sniff around.

731
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:44,073
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

732
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,744
And from what I've
seen and heard,

733
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:55,185
your Mr. Winthroppe is almost
certainly my Jack Jones.

734
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,990
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

735
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,859
There, it's done.

736
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,062
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

737
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:10,099
You may not understand this,
Winthroppe, as a father,

738
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,935
one takes one's responsibility

739
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,774
to one's family very seriously,
and to the family estate.

740
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,744
Knowing that Elizabeth
and Hargreave Hall

741
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:26,484
are in a safe pair of hands
gives one huge satisfaction.

742
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:32,923
It's liberating, it's almost
as if having signed this,

743
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,095
I'm no longer required at all.

744
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:40,997
(gentle music)
(rain splattering)

745
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,601
It's funny you should say that.

746
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,103
I feel the same way.

747
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,806
About you, I mean.

748
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,510
- [The Earl] Mm?
- (ominous music)

749
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,714
(dramatic music)
(The Earl grunting)

750
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:02,085
(dramatic music continues)
(The Earl thumping)

751
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,686
(dramatic music continues)

752
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,155
Careful, O'Reilly, he's
drooling all over it.

753
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,691
(ominous music)
(rain splattering)

754
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:12,128
Now you better make damn sure
you can get Elizabeth back.

755
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,833
- [O'Reilly] No problem.
- If I play this right,

756
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:21,906
Elizabeth will be begging
me to have Turpin dealt with

757
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,973
as harshly as possible.

758
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,676
(ominous music continues)
(rain splattering)

759
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:30,013
What an absolute
load of nonsense.

760
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,714
I knew you were jealous.

761
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,150
I am not jealous,
the man is a criminal.

762
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:35,818
That's rich coming from you.

763
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:39,089
I may be thief, but
I'm not a murderer.

764
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:45,161
The whole story makes no sense.

765
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,965
You said you were sentenced
to hang, yet here you are.

766
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,968
- I managed to escape.
- Oh, how convenient.

767
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:56,205
(rain splattering)
(mischievous music)

768
00:42:56,206 --> 00:43:00,310
We'll spend one night here,
and then in the morning,

769
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,711
I'll take you to
your Mr. Winthroppe

770
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,346
for whatever ransom I can get.

771
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:09,653
(mischievous music continues)
(straw rustling)

772
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:14,724
Am I supposed to
sleep on the floor?

773
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:19,797
(mischievous music continues)
(rain splattering)

774
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,165
- You can have the blanket.
- (blanket rustling)

775
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,734
(mischievous music continues)
(rain splattering)

776
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,769
You better not come near me.

777
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,606
I can assure you, your ladyship,

778
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,941
you have nothing to worry about.

779
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,814
(mischievous music continues)
(rain splattering)

780
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:49,959
(birds chirping)

781
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,629
I'm sorry to bother you
so early, Mr. Winthroppe,

782
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,297
but you did say in the morning.

783
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,832
[Henry] Is that the report
I've been waiting for?

784
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,268
More bad news, I'm
afraid, news from the mine.

785
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,970
Oh, what is it this time?

786
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,806
Well, you know the men are
digging deeper and deeper,

787
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,875
what with the upper
levels drying up?

788
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,910
Well, apparently
the deeper you go,

789
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:11,080
the greater the risk of a
buildup of noxious gases.

790
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,315
Yes, I know that.

791
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,983
That's what the air
pump system is for.

792
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,785
Well, the foreman told me

793
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,286
that it hadn't been
working for weeks.

794
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,656
I do recall hearing
something about that.

795
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,292
17 men were overwhelmed,
one nearly died.

796
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,328
Well, we are running a mine,

797
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,797
not a workers'
welfare association.

798
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:28,998
There are bound to
be some casualties.

799
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,167
That's part of the job.

800
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,102
Besides, I'm not gonna
repair the air pumps.

801
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,704
Why is that?

802
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,207
Is to rid the shaft
of combustible gases.

803
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,778
- Yes.
- Well, it just occurred

804
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:46,050
to me that should there be
an explosion in the shaft,

805
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,018
it could render the
mine inoperable.

806
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,820
No, but that will be a disaster.

807
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,088
Only for my insurers.

808
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,790
People will be killed.

809
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,827
Again, not a problem
for me personally.

810
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,996
I most assuredly won't
be anywhere near the site

811
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,731
when it happens.

812
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,167
Do the insurers know the
current value of the mine,

813
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,335
given that there's no damned
coal to be found in it?

814
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,837
I'm getting a little bit tired

815
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,139
of your remonstrations,
Arkwright.

816
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,741
Now let me see report.

817
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:15,378
(gentle music)
(tree squeaking)

818
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,082
(paper rustling)
(birds chirping)

819
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:23,186
The men began by digging
outside the Eastern boundary

820
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,754
of the estate.

821
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,490
By digging in diagonally,
they were able

822
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:30,193
to see the start
of a new coal seam

823
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,029
just inside the boundary.

824
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,398
The surveyor thinks
that the best place

825
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,135
to sink the shaft would be here.

826
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:40,937
On top of the hall?

827
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,073
Well, underneath the
hall to be precise.

828
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,943
It would have to be demolished
of course to make way for it.

829
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:49,746
Excellent, looks like
we're back in business.

830
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,214
If this all goes to plan,

831
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,249
the old mine can go to
the crows, for all I care.

832
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,952
Assuming the earl signs
the contract, of course.

833
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,754
It's already done.

834
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,789
And the wedding
goes ahead as planned?

835
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:02,158
The law is very
precise about that.

836
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,360
You have to be
related to the earl,

837
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,095
by marriage or otherwise,

838
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,397
for you to take full
advantage of the estate.

839
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:09,966
It's all in hand.

840
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,402
(ominous music)
(birds chirping)

841
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,271
Where is the earl, by the way?

842
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,473
Well, his presence
was no longer required.

843
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,776
For his own daughter's wedding?

844
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,944
Is he not going to walk
her down the aisle?

845
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,814
I wasn't aware that
was a legal necessity.

846
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:29,252
Besides the earl sadly
passed away in the night.

847
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:32,855
- (ominous music continues)
- What,

848
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,423
after he'd signed the contract?

849
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,893
Fortunately for us, yes.

850
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:39,262
This is all very strange.

851
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:41,330
Even by your standards,
Mr. Winthroppe.

852
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,199
By my standards?

853
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,067
I've gone along with
a lot of your schemes,

854
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:49,839
but this just doesn't sit
right with me, this one.

855
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,311
Since the contract's signed
and the survey's completed,

856
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,515
I'd rather have no
further part in this.

857
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,420
Well, I'm sorry you
feel that way, Arkwright.

858
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,089
As it happens,

859
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,327
I do have no further
requirements you need fulfill.

860
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:14,198
Very good, I'll
be on my way then.

861
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:24,208
There is just one more thing
in regards to the late earl.

862
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:29,278
- Yes?
- Well, I have some good news.

863
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,314
You'll soon be joining him.

864
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,449
- (birds chirping)
- What?

865
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,486
(suspenseful music)
(Arkwright grunting)

866
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:42,559
(suspenseful music continues)
(knife whooshing)

867
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,994
- No!
- Nobody goes against me,

868
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:48,164
Arkwright, you should
know that by now.

869
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:53,036
(suspenseful music continues)
(Arkwright grunting)

870
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:06,016
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

871
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:07,617
(footsteps thumping)

872
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:11,454
(gentle music continues)
(birds chirping)

873
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,357
Now, fetch me a bride.

874
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:17,660
What about Turpin?

875
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,163
I think it's best to let the
authorities deal with Turpin.

876
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:25,368
I've already ensured he'll get
an immediate death sentence.

877
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:27,404
Oh, while you're out,

878
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:30,439
inquire where one might
purchase some explosives.

879
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,909
(dramatic music)

880
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:37,981
(wood creaking)
(birds chirping)

881
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:44,388
- (straw rustling)
- Elizabeth!

882
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,390
Wake up, your ladyship.

883
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:52,462
(birds chirping)
(pages rustling)

884
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:58,435
(tree squeaking)
Elizabeth!

885
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,007
(tree squeaking)
Oh, what the hell, Elizabeth?

886
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,076
(dramatic music)

887
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,111
- [Elizabeth] Quiet.
- Ah.

888
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:13,984
I don't have to listen to
your nonsense anymore, Turpin.

889
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,519
- Untie me.
- And then what?

890
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,155
I'm going to
get Mr. Winthroppe

891
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:22,558
and he'll know exactly
what to do with you.

892
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,493
He'll kill me.

893
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,029
It's no more than you deserve.

894
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,132
But Mr. Winthroppe
is a gentleman.

895
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,301
I'm sure he will do
nothing of the sort.

896
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:35,004
In which case, he'll hand
me over to the authorities

897
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:39,042
and they'll kill me,
is that what you want?

898
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:44,014
It couldn't happen to
a more deserving fellow.

899
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,417
Well, now I know
that's how you feel.

900
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:51,388
Keep back, I'll
pull the trigger.

901
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,292
I'm sure you will.

902
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:57,660
I mean it.

903
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:02,199
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

904
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,173
I thought you were
gonna pull the trigger.

905
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,541
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

906
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,343
Are you truly not afraid to die?

907
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:18,481
(gentle music continues)

908
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,551
Not really, a pistol
needs gun powder

909
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,688
and a lead ball to fire.

910
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,493
(gun clicking)
This is empty.

911
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,794
You mean all that time,

912
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,662
you've been waving
that thing around?

913
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,032
I was never gonna shoot anybody.

914
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:40,704
(gentle music continues)
(birds chirping)

915
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,105
Come on, let's go.

916
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:47,309
Don't you have a plan,
I mean, to get away?

917
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,545
I'll think of something.

918
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,746
I told you I'm making
this up as I go.

919
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:56,052
(gentle music continues)
(footsteps thumping)

920
00:50:56,053 --> 00:51:00,657
(dramatic music)
(leaves crunching)

921
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:10,767
(birds chirping)
(door rattling)

922
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:16,473
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

923
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:23,146
(leaves crunching)
(birds chirping)

924
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,815
I could just walk
away, couldn't I?

925
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:28,851
(dramatic music)
(leaves crunching)

926
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,321
And you couldn't do anything.

927
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,622
Do you know your
way out this forest?

928
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:36,592
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

929
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,129
(leaves crunching)
(dramatic music continues)

930
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,866
[O'Reilly] Turpin, the
girl's coming with me now.

931
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,236
Is that thing even loaded?

932
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,639
My pistol's always
ready to fire.

933
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,844
Listen, if you work for
a man named Winthroppe,

934
00:51:54,845 --> 00:52:00,617
(dramatic music)
(fighters grunting)

935
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,122
(Dick thumping)

936
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:10,260
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

937
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:19,169
(fire crackling)
(ominous music)

938
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:26,676
(lock rattling)
(footsteps thumping)

939
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:34,484
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

940
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:40,824
Well, well, well, if it ain't
my old friend, Dick Turpin.

941
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,792
- Hello again.
- (Dick grunting)

942
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:48,865
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

943
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,334
I ever tell you about the
stash of loot I have hidden?

944
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,637
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

945
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:57,306
(fist thumping)
(birds chirping)

946
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:01,177
It's such a relief to
have you back, Elizabeth.

947
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,611
We were all getting
so terribly worried.

948
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,813
(birds chirping)
(tree squeaking)

949
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,950
Turpin is such a villain.

950
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:09,418
He could have done
anything to you.

951
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:14,491
(birds chirping)
(tree squeaking)

952
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,860
Did he do anything to you?

953
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,929
No, I'm fine, thank you.

954
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,864
(birds chirping)
(tree squeaking)

955
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,833
Well, the good news is we're
moving forward at a pace.

956
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,235
We've got an urgent appointment

957
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,837
with the Reverend
Peters this afternoon.

958
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,439
The Reverend Peters?

959
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:34,977
Well, we are due to be
married after all, Elizabeth.

960
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,747
Where is my father, is he here?

961
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:40,749
In the manner of speaking.

962
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,220
(somber music)
(birds chirping)

963
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,656
I'm sorry to say that your
father succumbed in the night

964
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:50,526
to the unbearable
stresses of the situation,

965
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,963
vis-a-vis your kidnapping by
the aforementioned Turpin.

966
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,365
He's currently laid
out downstairs,

967
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,300
awaiting transportation
to the church.

968
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,869
(somber music continues)
(birds chirping)

969
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,539
- What?
- There's no need to worry.

970
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,907
I've spoken with the Reverend

971
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,876
and he's agreed
to perform a sort

972
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,379
of combined wedding and funeral.

973
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:14,383
So as I say, there's
really no need to worry.

974
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:15,884
It's at three o'clock,

975
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,019
so you have plenty of
time to clean yourself up.

976
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:21,925
(somber music continues)
(birds chirping)

977
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,996
You actually want
to get married today?

978
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:31,033
There's no time like
the present, Elizabeth.

979
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,568
It's what your father
would've wanted.

980
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:37,306
(somber music continues)
(birds chirping)

981
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:39,541
It's all that Turpin's
fault, really.

982
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,444
The man's a veritable monster.

983
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,648
Thank goodness he's now
incarcerated in the local jail,

984
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:49,551
ready for the executioner's
ax this afternoon.

985
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,588
What, the executioner's ax?

986
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:55,958
Well, he has escaped the
noose before, Elizabeth.

987
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,793
This time we'll be
certain he's dead.

988
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:02,599
(somber music continues)
(birds chirping)

989
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:08,304
(papers rustling)

990
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,005
(somber music continues)
(birds chirping)

991
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:12,909
(papers rustling)

992
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,744
- What's this?
- (dramatic music)

993
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:16,845
It's just some business
papers, Elizabeth,

994
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,447
nothing you'd understand.

995
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,950
It's my father's
estate, that's our house.

996
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:23,652
It's just something
I was discussing

997
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,588
with your father before
his untimely passing.

998
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,490
(paper rustling)
(dramatic music continues)

999
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,459
It's a building plan.

1000
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,462
- Elizabeth.
- It's a mine.

1001
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:36,031
It just so happens
that Hargreave Hall

1002
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:40,336
is sitting on top of a rich
vein of very accessible coal.

1003
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,805
Accessible, how
can it be accessible

1004
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,641
if it's underneath the house?

1005
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,478
If the house was
no longer there.

1006
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:52,481
You want to knock
down Hargreave Hall

1007
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,050
and build a bloody
great mine in its place!

1008
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,418
The return on the investment

1009
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,720
will be phenomenal, Elizabeth.

1010
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,355
That's my house!

1011
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,623
The earl was in
complete agreement.

1012
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,393
You're a liar, my father

1013
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,362
would have never
have agreed to this.

1014
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:10,834
- O'Reilly.
- (dramatic music continues)

1015
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,604
Let's not make things
unpleasant, Elizabeth.

1016
00:56:15,605 --> 00:56:17,473
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

1017
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:18,807
Your feelings not withstanding,

1018
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,476
the earl was in
complete agreement

1019
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:23,479
and signed all the
necessary paperwork.

1020
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,947
All that is now required

1021
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,617
for me to acquire full
control of Hargreave Hall

1022
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:30,953
is for us to get married.

1023
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:34,990
That is going to happen
today at three o'clock,

1024
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,825
whether you like it or not.

1025
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,827
(dramatic music continues)
(Dick grunting)

1026
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:42,464
- (fire crackling)
- That's for the beating you

1027
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,533
gave me yesterday.

1028
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,637
- Oh, so we're even.
- Not even close.

1029
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:52,074
We'll be even come three
o'clock this afternoon

1030
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:55,577
when your head's on
the chopping block.

1031
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,548
- Three o'clock?
- Yeah, that's right.

1032
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,051
They're expecting quite a crowd,

1033
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,421
you being a famous
highwayman and all that.

1034
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,091
(fire crackling)
(bells ringing)

1035
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,094
- What's that?
- (bells ringing)

1036
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,029
It's the local
church across the road.

1037
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:18,902
(bells ringing)
(fire crackling)

1038
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:29,077
It's two o'clock.
(ominous music)

1039
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,214
You got an hour to live.

1040
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:34,583
You best make the most of it.

1041
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,519
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

1042
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,788
This is all very irregular.

1043
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,557
We normally ask that the
happy couple attend services

1044
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,492
for three months
prior to the wedding.

1045
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:47,496
Yes, I do appreciate that,
Reverent, but in this case,

1046
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:50,099
time is very much
of the essence.

1047
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,504
Ah, I see, well,
these things do happen.

1048
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,773
And when is the young lady due?

1049
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,108
- Half past two.
- I'm sorry.

1050
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,177
For a three o'clock wedding.

1051
00:58:02,178 --> 00:58:04,246
She'll be arriving
at half past two.

1052
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,114
Ah, yes, of course.

1053
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:11,187
And I'm sure a suitably large
donation to the church funds

1054
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,022
would help cover
any additional costs

1055
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:16,860
due to these irregularities.

1056
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:20,829
Well, of course there
are always costs associated

1057
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,266
with a wedding, of course,
the church fee, my own fee,

1058
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,802
the choir fee,
the organist's fee

1059
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:30,072
and other
miscellaneous expenses.

1060
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,809
Then we understand each other.

1061
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,110
I believe we do.

1062
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:38,081
(dramatic music)

1063
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:44,653
(fire crackling)
(ominous music)

1064
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,957
Listen, I need to
tell you something.

1065
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:52,227
You think I'm gonna fall for
the same trick again, Turpin?

1066
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,695
It's not that.

1067
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,731
Listen, I have some
important information

1068
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:57,533
about a local gentleman
called Winthroppe.

1069
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,569
- Do you know of him?
- Of course I do.

1070
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,306
Me brother-in-law
works down his mine.

1071
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,174
Half the people in this
town owe their livelihood

1072
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:07,944
to Mr. Winthroppe.

1073
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,813
He's a great man,
one of the best.

1074
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:15,951
- (ominous music continues)
- Oh.

1075
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:19,222
So, what's this
valuable information?

1076
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,993
- Never mind.
- (ominous music continues)

1077
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,564
(bells ringing)

1078
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:32,101
Relax, Turpin, it
ain't three O'clock yet.

1079
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,704
What are the bells for?

1080
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,641
- Must be a wedding.
- A wedding?

1081
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:44,614
(ominous music continues)
(bells ringing)

1082
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:49,651
(footsteps thumping)
(O'Reilly grunting)

1083
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:52,188
(bells ringing)

1084
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,357
Shall we get on with it?

1085
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,093
- Don't touch me.
- Shut up!

1086
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,862
But it isn't three o'clock
yet, the choir hasn't arrived.

1087
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,198
Oh, we can do without
the hymns, Reverend.

1088
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,200
I'd sooner get this over with.

1089
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,737
Very well, music, please.

1090
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,708
(dramatic organ music)

1091
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,225
What's the matter?

1092
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,893
Haven't you ever heard
of a shotgun wedding?

1093
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:35,331
(dramatic music continues)

1094
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:41,003
(fire crackling)

1095
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:44,773
Are you sure those bells
are to signify a wedding?

1096
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,710
Pretty sure, it's funny though,

1097
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:53,849
they don't normally have
weddings on a Thursday.

1098
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,083
Must be a rush job.

1099
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:59,955
(fire crackling)
(ominous music)

1100
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,925
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

1101
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:07,764
to join this man and this
woman in holy matrimony,

1102
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:15,303
which is an honorable
estate instituted by God

1103
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,174
in the time of man's innocence,

1104
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:24,914
signifying the mystical union
between Christ and his church.

1105
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:28,684
This union, which Christ
adorned and beautified

1106
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,987
by His presence and was
commended by St. Paul

1107
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,156
to be honorable amongst all men

1108
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,793
and is therefore not
to be taken lightly.

1109
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,761
Yes, can we skip
this bit, Reverend?

1110
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:40,395
We haven't got all day.

1111
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:43,299
(dramatic music)

1112
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:46,768
Yes, very well.

1113
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:49,805
(dramatic music continues)

1114
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,742
(ominous music)

1115
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:58,847
Do thou takest this woman
to be thy wedded wife,

1116
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,383
to live together
after God's ordinance

1117
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,120
in the holy estate of matrimony?

1118
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:09,291
Will thou love her,
comfort, honor and keep her

1119
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,893
in sickness and in health,

1120
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:16,264
and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her

1121
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:19,102
as long as you both shall live?

1122
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:25,141
- I will.
- (ominous music continues)

1123
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:31,346
Will thou takest this man
to be thy wedded husband,

1124
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:35,050
to live together
after God's ordinance

1125
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:38,353
in the holy estate of matrimony,

1126
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,856
will thou love him, comfort him,

1127
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:44,760
honor and keep him in
sickness and in health,

1128
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,394
and forsaking all of others,

1129
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:49,531
keep thee only unto him as
long as you both shall live?

1130
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:53,102
(ominous music continues)

1131
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:02,245
- She will.
- (ominous music continues)

1132
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,312
Who givest this
woman to be married

1133
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:06,983
- to this man?
- Oh, O'Reilly.

1134
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:11,854
(ominous music continues)
(footsteps thumping)

1135
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,393
(fire crackling)
(ominous music continues)

1136
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,496
What's going to happen to me?

1137
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:24,400
Well, just before three o'clock,

1138
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:29,838
there'll be a knock at the door.

1139
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:32,407
That'll be someone from the
magistrate's office come

1140
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,376
to take you to the executioner.

1141
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,445
(somber music)
(fire crackling)

1142
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,815
What about my last words?

1143
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:43,119
If you got anything
to say, say it now,

1144
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,989
'cause any minute,
it's all gonna be over.

1145
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:51,126
(somber music continues)
(fire crackling)

1146
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,895
(birds chirping)

1147
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:58,301
- And now we pray.
- (dramatic music)

1148
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:04,172
Oh, eternal God and
creator of all mankind,

1149
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:09,245
giver of all spiritual grace
and author of everlasting life,

1150
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,414
send down Thy blessings
upon these, Thy servants,

1151
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:16,452
this man and this woman,
who we bless in Thy name,

1152
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,988
so they surely may keep

1153
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:23,960
and perform the vows and
covenants betwixt them

1154
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:29,531
and ever remain in
perfect peace and love,

1155
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:34,604
according to Your laws through
Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen.

1156
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,508
And now as much as this man.

1157
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,078
What is it?

1158
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,882
I don't know your Christian
name, Mr. Winthroppe.

1159
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,351
- Henry.
- This man Henry

1160
01:04:49,352 --> 01:04:52,187
- and this wo...
- Elizabeth.

1161
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:56,491
And this woman Elizabeth
have joined together

1162
01:04:56,492 --> 01:05:00,596
in holy wedlock and
witnessed as much before God,

1163
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:04,966
I now pronounce them to be...

1164
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:07,168
(dramatic music)
Jesus Christ.

1165
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:11,907
Nobody move. You keep this
ready to fire at all times,

1166
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,942
isn't that right, Mr. O'Reilly?

1167
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:18,213
(dramatic music continues)

1168
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:22,250
So all I have to do
is pull the trigger

1169
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,186
and someone's losing their head.

1170
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,124
Elizabeth, let's
not do anything...

1171
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:33,194
- Shut up!
- (dramatic music continues)

1172
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,397
- Which way to the jail?
- What?

1173
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:39,200
The jail, which
way is it from here?

1174
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,069
It's out through the
church gates, turn left,

1175
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,671
and it's across the street.

1176
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:47,543
(dramatic music continues)
(footsteps thumping)

1177
01:05:50,513 --> 01:05:52,080
She's going after Turpin.

1178
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:56,251
(dramatic music continues)
(roses crunching)

1179
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:59,587
It won't be long now, Turpin.

1180
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:02,124
I'm looking forward to this.

1181
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:06,962
I've not seen a beheading
since I was a little 'un.

1182
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,998
We had a kick about in the
square afterwards with the head.

1183
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:15,271
Jesus, what sort of revolting
backwater is this town?

1184
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:20,108
This is Winthroppe's
town, bought and paid for.

1185
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:22,077
(ominous music)
(fire crackling)

1186
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:26,281
(door thumping)
(hands slapping)

1187
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,649
Here we go.

1188
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:32,188
(ominous music continues)
(fire crackling)

1189
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,356
(wood scraping)
(dramatic music)

1190
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:36,758
I'm looking for Dick.

1191
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,361
I bet you are.

1192
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,462
(pistol thumping)
(gaoler grunting)

1193
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,630
- (keys rattling)
- Grab his keys.

1194
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,166
- We haven't got much time.
- You're telling me.

1195
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,768
(dramatic music continues)
(Dick chuckling)

1196
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:49,404
(keys rattling)
(gate rattling)

1197
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:53,074
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

1198
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,510
- (footsteps thumping)
- Wait!

1199
01:06:55,511 --> 01:07:00,081
(gentle music)
Dick, I'm sorry.

1200
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:02,150
You were right about Winthroppe.

1201
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:04,319
You were right about everything.

1202
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,721
Never mind mind about
that now, Elizabeth,

1203
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:10,125
we've gotta get out of sight.

1204
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,493
You certainly know how to
pick a dress, don't you?

1205
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,561
- (gentle music continues)
- Sorry.

1206
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,799
(birds chirping)
(tree squeaking)

1207
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:21,202
You bloody idiot, O'Reilly.

1208
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,470
How could you let
her take your pistol?

1209
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,106
(ominous music)

1210
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:27,175
How are we going to
get her back now?

1211
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,611
Don't worry about it, sir.

1212
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,513
I have a good idea where
they'll be sleeping tonight.

1213
01:07:31,514 --> 01:07:35,084
(ominous music continues)

1214
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:42,224
(rain splattering)
(footsteps thumping)

1215
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:59,107
(gentle music)
(rain splattering)

1216
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:03,212
You know, you saved my
life today, Elizabeth.

1217
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,480
You could have just
left me in that jail.

1218
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,382
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1219
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,851
It was something
Winthroppe said,

1220
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,519
but I didn't realize it

1221
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,623
until I was stood there
about to be married to him.

1222
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,559
What was that?

1223
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,130
He told me that you
escaped the noose before.

1224
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:24,800
How could he have
known that unless...

1225
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,670
- Unless?
- Everything you told me

1226
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,238
was the truth.

1227
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,108
(rain splattering)
(gentle music continues)

1228
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,409
I'm so sorry I
didn't believe you.

1229
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,246
(rain splattering)
(gentle music continues)

1230
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,582
So what do you want to do?

1231
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:43,618
I don't know, there
must be some way we

1232
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,554
can stop Winthroppe.

1233
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:50,892
For now, I just want to get
out of this blasted dress.

1234
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:52,260
I can hardly breathe in it.

1235
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,762
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1236
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,131
I could help you with
that, if you'd like.

1237
01:08:56,132 --> 01:09:01,137
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1238
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:09,378
- All right.
- (gentle music continues)

1239
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:14,315
(footsteps thumping)

1240
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,284
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1241
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,654
It's all tied up at the
back, like a corset.

1242
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:22,657
Yes, I think I've got it.

1243
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,759
Is that any better?

1244
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,294
(gasps) It feels like it.

1245
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:28,463
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1246
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,299
- Almost there.
- Yes.

1247
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:35,170
- [Dick] Closer?
- Very close.

1248
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,438
- Almost there.
- (gasps) Yes.

1249
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,511
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1250
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,349
- Now what?
- (Elizabeth panting)

1251
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:52,887
Now it just lifts over my head.

1252
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:57,960
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1253
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:07,835
Like this?

1254
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:12,374
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1255
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,555
What now?

1256
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:32,294
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1257
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:33,962
Why don't you decide?

1258
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:36,998
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1259
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,733
Well, it is your
wedding night after all.

1260
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:43,572
(gentle music continues)
(rain splattering)

1261
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:52,881
(ominous music)
(rain splattering)

1262
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,620
What about the explosives?

1263
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:00,823
No, those are for the mine.

1264
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:05,393
Paraffin then, the whole
place will go up like tinder.

1265
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:08,396
(ominous music continues)
(rain splattering)

1266
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:09,931
But we've got to get
the girl out first.

1267
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,468
- (ominous music continues)
- That's your job.

1268
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:15,270
I'll deal with Turpin.

1269
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,905
(ominous music continues)
(rain splattering)

1270
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:21,477
Make sure you do, I
want him dead, dead!

1271
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,951
(ominous music continues)
(rain splattering)

1272
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,755
Well, we finally found
something you're good at.

1273
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:35,357
What do you mean?

1274
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,593
Well, I was thinking,

1275
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:41,029
you're not much of
an outlaw, are you?

1276
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,465
The legendary Dick Turpin.

1277
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,802
You get caught every
time you go out (laughs).

1278
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:50,305
I don't write the legends.

1279
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,542
They just get
exaggerated over time.

1280
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:57,979
Everyone likes a good
story, don't they?

1281
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,481
Even you.
(thunder droning)

1282
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,749
I prefer the real thing.

1283
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:05,586
(rain splattering)
(birds chirping)

1284
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:08,556
Where did you
learn how to do it?

1285
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,091
What, highway robbery?

1286
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,995
No, stupid, how to treat a lady?

1287
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:19,100
(rain splattering)
(thunder droning)

1288
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,036
I was married once,
a long time ago.

1289
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,973
(rain splattering)

1290
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,508
I didn't know that.

1291
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,479
(rain splattering)

1292
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,947
Remember that story I told you

1293
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:36,784
about how I fell in
with Jack Jones' gang?

1294
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:39,921
Well, the girl I was married to,

1295
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,858
she worked in the butcher's too.

1296
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:47,829
Wasn't long before they had
her fencing stolen goods.

1297
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:52,700
- What happened?
- (rain splattering)

1298
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:56,839
Apart from Jones, we all
got sentenced to the noose.

1299
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,076
I managed to escape.

1300
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:07,449
She didn't.
(rain splattering)

1301
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:16,024
(grass rustling)

1302
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:22,431
(door squeaking)
(footsteps thumping)

1303
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:30,973
(rain splattering)
(thunder droning)

1304
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,943
(suspenseful music)

1305
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:37,712
- Well.
- (Elizabeth gasping)

1306
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:41,617
(suspenseful music continues)

1307
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:45,153
I can't say I'm totally
shocked. Elizabeth,

1308
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,554
not even married yet,

1309
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:47,722
and you've already
been unfaithful to me.

1310
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,559
(suspenseful music continues)

1311
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,728
What are you doing?

1312
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,564
I'm saving a life
of my fiance, Turpin,

1313
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,767
from a notorious criminal
who's kidnapped her

1314
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:03,805
and held her hostage in a
dangerously inflammable building.

1315
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:06,574
- Inflammable?
- (suspenseful music continues)

1316
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:11,112
Look at this, all
these candles everywhere.

1317
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,647
Goodness knows
what might happen.

1318
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,750
(suspenseful music continues)
(rain splattering)

1319
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,653
O'Reilly, oil, please.

1320
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:23,959
(suspenseful music continues)
(oil splashing)

1321
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,795
Come along, Elizabeth.

1322
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:32,099
For God's sake, put on some
clothes, you look like a whore.

1323
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,568
I would sooner stay with Turpin

1324
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,102
and burn to death than
go anywhere with you.

1325
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:37,972
(suspenseful music continues)

1326
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,775
She knows who you are, Jack.

1327
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,644
- Oh, really?
- (suspenseful music continues)

1328
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,748
Well, perhaps it will be
better if you did burn to death.

1329
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:51,886
(suspenseful music continues)
(rain splattering)

1330
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:56,258
O'Reilly, a little bit more
oil, please, on these two.

1331
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,967
(suspenseful music continues)

1332
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,844
Always ready to fire, O'Reilly.

1333
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,013
(gun firing)
(O'Reilly grunting)

1334
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,181
(suspenseful music continues)
(O'Reilly thumping)

1335
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:24,586
(fire roaring)
(O'Reilly screaming)

1336
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:27,822
Quick, Elizabeth, the door.

1337
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:32,627
(suspenseful music continues)
(lock rattling)

1338
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:34,195
(fire roaring)
(suspenseful music continues)

1339
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,030
I meant go out through
it, not lock us in.

1340
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,999
(suspenseful music continues)
(fire roaring)

1341
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,168
So, this is it, Turpin.

1342
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:44,005
(suspenseful music continues)
(fire roaring)

1343
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,306
It's just you and me.

1344
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,707
(suspenseful music continues)
(fire roaring)

1345
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:50,578
I have waited a long
time for this, Jack.

1346
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,679
You must have known
that sooner or later,

1347
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,981
one of us would track you down.

1348
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,886
I did, that's why I've
always been prepared.

1349
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:00,555
(suspenseful music continues)
(fire roaring)

1350
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,057
(knife whooshing)
(Elizabeth gasping)

1351
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:08,130
(suspenseful music continues)
(fire roaring)

1352
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:14,202
(fighters grunting)
(suspenseful music continues)

1353
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:40,662
(Jack grunting)
(suspenseful music continues)

1354
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:45,733
(Jack thumping)
(fire roaring)

1355
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:49,070
- (gentle music)
- Why don't you ever do

1356
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:52,975
- what I tell you?
- I never do what men tell me.

1357
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,777
But anyway, where would I go?

1358
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,046
One thing at a time, Elizabeth.

1359
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,048
Now let's get out of here
before the whole place goes up.

1360
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:05,921
(gentle music continues)
(fire roaring)

1361
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:17,165
(dramatic music)
(wind howling)

1362

(hooves thumping)
(horse neighing)

1363
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:23,972
(dramatic music continues)
(birds chirping)

1364
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:36,685
(hooves clomping)
(dramatic music continues)

1365
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:42,823
(grass rustling)
(horse snorting)

1366
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:47,696
(dramatic music continues)
(hooves clomping)

1367
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,297
Are you sure your
want to do this?

1368
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:53,134
- (birds chirping)
- What else can I do?

1369
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:55,169
I have no income,
nowhere to stay.

1370
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,138
I can't possibly afford
to keep Hargreave Hall.

1371
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,173
(birds chirping)

1372
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,675
All right, then.

1373
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:01,842
Now remember what I said,

1374
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:03,344
when the carriage comes
around the corner.

1375
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,313
I know what I'm doing,
I've read all the stories.

1376
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:10,751
In those stories,
everything gets exaggerated.

1377
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:11,452
Not everything does.

1378
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:15,123

(suspenseful music continues)
(hooves clomping)

1381
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,472
[Dick] Stand and deliver.
