2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,982
I want to get a good picture,

3
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:29,273
some more pictures.

4
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,438
This is Carey's room, her bed.

5
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:43,649
This is the birthday girl's mattress
and everything else.

6
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,071
She's even got a TV

7
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,392
in her room.

8
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:47,725
Ain't she lucky?

9
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:51,028
That's my sister.

10
00:00:53,823 --> 00:00:55,447
The birthday girl.

11
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:58,361
Ain't she beautiful?

12
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:01,739
And here is her brother.

13
00:01:01,782 --> 00:01:03,191
Nick.

14
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,312
The thought of what somebody
could have done to him...

15
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:24,731
It gives you nightmares.

16
00:01:27,033 --> 00:01:28,573
It really does.

17
00:01:33,573 --> 00:01:36,488
His disappearance never made the news.

18
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,606
It wasn't news to them,

19
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:43,361
it was just news to us.

20
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:57,861
It came to the point where, you know,
you're not gonna find him alive,

21
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,154
but you just want to
find what happened to him.

22
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:52,656
They called me at work when I wasn't there

23
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:58,698
and they wrote a message and said,
"Someone from Spain has Nicholas."

24
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:01,573
He wants to come home.

25
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:02,946
My mom called me.

26
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:04,819
I was at work.

27
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,112
And she says, "Sitting down?

28
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,701
You're not going to believe this."

29
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:10,944
Course. It was mysterious,

30
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:13,316
it was er... exciting,

31
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,820
it was worrisome,

32
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:18,235
er, it was all mixed emotions, you know?

33
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,945
Ecstatic.

34
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:21,734
Bewildered.

35
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:22,947
You know, Spain!

36
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,700
Isn't that like across the country?

37
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:27,030
Um, how did he get there?

38
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:30,158
You want...
you have like a hundred thousand questions

39
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,984
that you want answered immediately.

40
00:03:32,076 --> 00:03:34,826
I felt wonderful,

41
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:38,444
you know, excited.

42
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:42,741
You wanna see him, touch him,
you know what I mean?

43
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:45,821
And you want it all to happen now.

44
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,998
From as long as I remember,
I wanted to be someone else.

45
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:13,528
Someone who was acceptable.

46
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:30,654
The most important thing for me and what
I learned very fast was to be convincing.

47
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,998
When the police arrive,

48
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,114
I have immediately to put into their mind

49
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:42,535
they have a kid in front of them,
not an adult.

50
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:45,615
So it was very important for me
to behave like one.

51
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:13,527
They would see me with...
in a big coat with younger clothes.

52
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,288
And they would see a kid with a hat,
which is very low in the eyes.

53
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:19,611
They couldn't see my eyes.

54
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,001
I wanted to provoke on them
a sense of guilt...

55
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,915
...of being adults and to be close to a kid
which is dead scared.

56
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,367
When you see a kid that,
you know, got nervous reflexes,

57
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:44,250
that you can't touch them,
you can't approach them,

58
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:47,705
then you understand, you understand
that something is wrong.

59
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:08,072
I wasn't the one who was telling them
I've been sexually abused.

60
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:11,372
I made them ask me that by my attitude,

61
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,289
by my way of doing things.

62
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,583
They were the one thinking about it
and that gave me power.

63
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:39,703
I didn't speak much.

64
00:07:43,753 --> 00:07:49,951
It's very hard to read a kid
that doesn't speak a word sometime.

65
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,002
If a cop don't know who a kid is
and where he comes from,

66
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:04,330
he just can't keep him
in the police station.

67
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:10,701
And I knew that eventually they would
have to put me into a children's home...

68
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:15,295
...and that's all I wanted.

69
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:35,957
Nobody ever gave a damn about me

70
00:08:36,005 --> 00:08:40,661
and to know that if I change my identity

71
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:43,284
the reward was eventually
to be put in a place

72
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:45,707
where actually
they really cared about me...

73
00:08:46,255 --> 00:08:49,751
then, hell, yeah.
I mean, I was reborn.

74
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,787
I mean... I was born again.

75
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:57,586
Nobody ever gave me a childhood,

76
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:01,077
because to give a kid a childhood
you need to, to love that kid.

77
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,080
I felt like I belonged there.

78
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:21,627
They didn't know
that I was 23, 23 years old.

79
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:26,203
I was considered like one of them.

80
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:47,081
I told him to be home by dinner

81
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,709
and gave him five bucks
to go play basketball,

82
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,912
and... he took off.

83
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:59,251
He called home, asking for a ride, er...

84
00:09:59,297 --> 00:10:01,087
which was probably, I don't know,

85
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:03,587
he's within a couple of miles
from his house

86
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:08,505
and his mother works late
and sleeps during the day

87
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,918
and his older brother Jason
answered the phone.

88
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:19,963
When I woke up Jason was there and said
that he had called and wanted a ride home,

89
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:22,165
but Jason didn't want to wake me up,

90
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,539
so told him he had to walk home.

91
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:33,795
And that's... was the day,
the last time we heard from him.

92
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:41,497
You spend 24 hours crying, sick, worried,

93
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:45,215
then you get mad, then you get scared,

94
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,084
and then you try to get empowered.
You know, "OK, what can we do?

95
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,206
We have to do flyers,
we'll do this, we'll..."

96
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:51,627
You know, so instead of...

97
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:56,962
you don't cry, you do something positive

98
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,506
and try to work towards, I guess,
a solution of finding him.

99
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:06,999
I thought somebody offered him
a ride, and he got in the car.

100
00:11:09,844 --> 00:11:13,504
I dunno, I think he would have got in a car
with someone that he didn't know.

101
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,505
What are you looking at?

102
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:27,415
I could see the worry and the pain
they were going through,

103
00:11:27,468 --> 00:11:31,331
so I always said, you know,
"He's out there," you know.

104
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:33,092
"He'll resurface," you know.

105
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:54,377
Unfortunately for me, it was one of
those places which is very rare in Spain

106
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:58,963
where actually they can't stand
having a kid with no identity card,

107
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,169
er, no proof of who he is.

108
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:12,088
They wanted absolutely to know who I was,
where do I come from,

109
00:12:12,137 --> 00:12:14,755
erm, they needed to know precise.

110
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,300
"If you don't tell us,
if can't prove us who you are,

111
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:25,128
I'm gonna have you fingerprinted
and your pictures taken."

112
00:12:26,887 --> 00:12:29,043
I couldn't allow that to happen.

113
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,631
I had to find a way out of that.

114
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,925
So the only, only thing left there was

115
00:12:34,969 --> 00:12:37,125
was 1) go to prison

116
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:41,510
2) prove to them that I'm someone.

117
00:12:51,306 --> 00:12:53,462
I said that I was American.

118
00:12:54,305 --> 00:13:00,136
That er... I ran away and I was
willing to contact my family for them

119
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,418
but I wanted to do it myself.

120
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:08,926
I didn't want my family to receive a phone call
from the police or the persecutor

121
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,678
or the judge in Spain.

122
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,180
I wanted to do it myself.

123
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:15,846
And I said I would need to be
in the office for the night

124
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:17,381
because I live in the States.

125
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,126
The States is, you know,
the times is different, it's er...

126
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,546
So erm, you know,
just leave me in the office

127
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,588
and tomorrow you will have all you need.

128
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,504
In this office nobody could hear me.

129
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,052
I knew that I could pass myself
for anyone on the phone,

130
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,721
could convince anyone of anything.

131
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,679
So I call the American Police.

132
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,013
County South, Detective Fowler.

133
00:14:14,056 --> 00:14:15,135
The New York Police.

134
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,514
Lieutenant Kojak's office.

135
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,344
Different police stations in the States.

136
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,506
- Dobie here.
- Who is this, please?

137
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:26,223
I told them every time
that I was a policeman from Spain

138
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:28,511
called Jonathan Dorian,

139
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:30,345
that we had found a kid,

140
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,381
we are sure he's from the States
but we don't know where.

141
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:35,628
How long ago was this?

142
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:40,306
He's been maybe missing for a few years,
that someone must be looking for him.

143
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:43,928
So the police say, well, you know,

144
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:47,306
we got hundreds of posters
of missing persons on the wall

145
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,637
and we just can't go through each of them.

146
00:14:49,683 --> 00:14:51,425
But what we can do for you

147
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:55,303
is to give you the number of the centre
for missing and exploited children

148
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,891
of Arlington, Virginia.

149
00:15:04,225 --> 00:15:08,135
Centre for missing and exploited children.
Lorraine speaking. How may I help you?

150
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,047
Er, we have a kid in a shelter,
certainly is American,

151
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,091
who is about 14, 15 years old

152
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:18,548
but the problem is
we don't know who he is...

153
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,009
I describe myself.

154
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,720
Every detail I gave was details
that I know that I could handle.

155
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:28,053
I wanted to be vague enough for her
to look at many different things.

156
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:30,670
I wanted her to have many possibilities.

157
00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:32,004
Let me just take a look here.

158
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,968
"I got maybe something," she said.

159
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:38,178
"Maybe, you know,
we got a kid from San Antonio

160
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,428
missing since June 13, 1994.

161
00:15:41,477 --> 00:15:43,764
His name is Nicholas Barclay."

162
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,974
I said, "Could you send me a fax
of what he looks like?"

163
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:53,971
In my head, I was just a police officer
with, with Nicholas Barclay next to me,

164
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,806
trying to confirm his identity
and like any other policeman would do.

165
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,598
Let's see if it's him.

166
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,973
I thought, let's see if it's him.

167
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:19,096
I look at it, black and white picture,
old picture.

168
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,802
Well, missing for three or four years,

169
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:27,052
guarantee one thing,
there will be a change.

170
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,887
If there is a change, there will be doubt.

171
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:32,508
If there is doubt, then I got a chance.

172
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:41,058
Something in my head decided
I could do it, that I had to try.

173
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:52,057
I took the phone and I told her
that this is Nicholas.

174
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:54,010
We got him, it's him.

175
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:56,100
It's incredible, it's him.

176
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:13,138
My mom called me
and she says, "Are you sitting down?

177
00:17:13,187 --> 00:17:15,225
You're not gonna believe this."

178
00:17:15,312 --> 00:17:18,475
And I said, "What, Mom?" She goes,
"The police department called me

179
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,684
and they think they found Nicholas
in Linares."

180
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,848
So I'm like, "OK,
where in Texas is Linares?"

181
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:27,102
Because Texas has a lot of small towns.

182
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,186
And then she was like, "No, Spain."

183
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:30,558
I'm like, "Spain?"

184
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:36,179
Oh, God, how to explain the emotions.

185
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,637
It's like all these different emotions,
from excitement to bewilderment,

186
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,645
to what do we do?

187
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:46,635
What's the next step? How do we get him?
When do we get to talk to him?

188
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,890
I knew that after that
they would contact me.

189
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:56,560
They would try to verify, to call,
to see, to... Is it true? Is it here?

190
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,846
Is it, you know...
Carey, the family and all that.

191
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:11,978
Well, when I first got, you know,
got a hold of the shelter,

192
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:15,102
they put me on the phone
with Jonathan Dorian

193
00:18:15,146 --> 00:18:18,231
who said that he worked
for the, a shelter,

194
00:18:18,316 --> 00:18:21,811
and that he was the one
who was talking with Nicholas

195
00:18:21,857 --> 00:18:25,554
and had got the information from Nicholas
on who he really was.

196
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,558
When she called, I said that Nicholas
was seated next to me.

197
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:36,138
But he was very scared,
he was very traumatized

198
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,933
and he didn't want to talk to no-one.

199
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:40,648
He sounded very responsible,
very concerned.

200
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,387
Er, he claims that he has been abused,
that he's been hurt,

201
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:47,687
that erm... certainly he's been abducted.

202
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:51,511
I kind of thought he was like
a social worker type of person.

203
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:54,137
Um, very reassuring.

204
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,729
She said, "Is he saying anything?

205
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:58,979
Is he talking about us? Does he remember?"

206
00:18:59,025 --> 00:19:02,471
Well, actually, I think he forgot
about everything, you know.

207
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:04,395
He doesn't remember very much.

208
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,726
He remember you but not very much.

209
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:12,142
We were told he was held by
some kind of like a sex slave kind of ring,

210
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:17,774
and that he had escaped from there and
that he was found wandering the streets.

211
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,934
She was heartbroken
but at the same time she was very happy.

212
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:22,643
I wanted to hear his voice.

213
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,066
No!

214
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:28,730
Absolutely, there was no way I was going
to talk to her pretending to be Nicholas

215
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:32,437
because I wasn't Nicholas
and she was his sister,

216
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:35,979
so er... it would have been a risk,

217
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,898
too big a risk for me,

218
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,814
but I did say a few words.

219
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:44,023
She said: "Hello, Nicholas.
You hear me, Nicholas?"

220
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:48,642
Nothing.

221
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:52,393
"I love you, Nicholas.
I want to take you back home with me.

222
00:19:52,443 --> 00:19:53,722
I'm gonna take you, baby.

223
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,850
I'm gonna come and get you and..."

224
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,640
And maybe you hear "Love you"
or something like that, you know.

225
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:05,691
Very far away. It, it...

226
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:07,689
And then she say: "Was it him?"

227
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:09,608
I said, "Yeah. He said 'I love you."'

228
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:12,024
Oh. And then she started crying
on the phone.

229
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:17,983
You start crying, you tell him, "We're
going to come and get you, bring you home.

230
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:21,440
We'll get there, we're going to bring
you home, and I love you too."

231
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:27,146
I erm... I washed her brain.

232
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:47,652
I didn't stop,
because I didn't think of stopping.

233
00:20:48,945 --> 00:20:52,937
I didn't watch myself in the mirror
and say, "What the fuck are you doing?

234
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,059
Stop that immediately."

235
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:07,727
I realized that I've crossed the line.

236
00:21:09,446 --> 00:21:14,779
I wasn't pretending no more
to have another identity. I stole one.

237
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:33,982
I got a phone call: "Would you please
call a Carey Gibson?"

238
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:38,644
Well, I was astounded by what Carey said,

239
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:44,608
so one of the first things I said to her was,

240
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:49,192
when the FBI
and the US State Department assist you

241
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:54,653
and uh... get you and your brother back here,
I have to interview him immediately.

242
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:04,532
When the welfare of a minor,

243
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,196
er... is in jeopardy,

244
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,317
our reaction has to be very quick,

245
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:10,987
er... very responsive.

246
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,274
We have to put ourselves

247
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,566
in the position of the child

248
00:22:13,613 --> 00:22:15,688
or the child's parents or guardians.

249
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:19,647
Generally when a child is missing for years,

250
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:24,900
either the child is dead or the child is not found

251
00:22:24,947 --> 00:22:29,901
and to find that child in another country
is extremely rare.

252
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:33,480
That made it all the more compelling for us

253
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:37,360
to make sure that we did everything right
in terms of er...

254
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:40,569
establishing who he was
and getting him back to his family.

255
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:42,570
My main concern was getting him back,

256
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:46,311
so that my part could start,
the investigation could start...

257
00:22:46,447 --> 00:22:48,852
we could find out
what had happened to this child.

258
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,061
I sent somebody out there
as quickly as possible.

259
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,396
The next day...
The next day, it got beyond my control.

260
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,897
The centre for missing
and exploited children sent me a flyer.

261
00:23:10,699 --> 00:23:14,066
There was the picture of Nicholas
at the time of his disappearance...

262
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:22,739
And I saw what real Nicholas looked like,
really with colors and everything.

263
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:27,980
He was very blond, very...

264
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,356
He had blue eyes.

265
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,446
He looked nothing like me!

266
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,188
Nothing!

267
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:37,358
There's, you know, the only thing
he had in common with me

268
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:39,777
was that he had five fingers
at each hands.

269
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:43,855
Then I said, fuck, let's burn myself.

270
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,606
You know, I burned the flyer.

271
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,816
If I could have burned the identity that I said

272
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,618
and every word that had been
out of my mouth for the past few days,

273
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:53,401
I would have burned them too!

274
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:04,235
When everyone tells me
that the American Embassy is coming

275
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,986
and er... everybody's, you know...

276
00:24:07,035 --> 00:24:09,605
and don't worry, Nicholas,
we're gonna take care of you.

277
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:14,897
Well, yeah, OK,
you know, I... I couldn't do nothing.

278
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:16,695
The only thing I could do

279
00:24:16,743 --> 00:24:20,025
was think of how was going to be the prison
where I was going to be.

280
00:24:29,826 --> 00:24:31,200
I didn't know what to do.

281
00:24:31,243 --> 00:24:33,280
I really didn't know what to do.

282
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:37,485
When the Vice Consul
first arrived in Linares,

283
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:40,615
he got to the centre and found
Nicholas Barclay had disappeared.

284
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:48,488
I said, you've got to find him.

285
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,197
So he essentially,
with somebody from the Linares Centre,

286
00:24:54,245 --> 00:24:56,366
went around looking for him.

287
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:01,868
Our priority was his safety and to make sure
he was reunited with the family.

288
00:25:05,787 --> 00:25:09,282
I tried to run away
like I would do anywhere else.

289
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,077
Nicholas Barclay?

290
00:25:17,869 --> 00:25:19,943
God didn't want me to leave this place.

291
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:24,487
I spoke with the vice consul and asked him
about his interactions with Nicholas.

292
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:28,529
He reported at the time
that he spoke English,

293
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:33,901
that he, he was,
he was at least at that moment

294
00:25:33,953 --> 00:25:35,693
convinced that this was an American.

295
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:47,239
When I woke up the next morning,
everything was normal.

296
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:55,535
Then I saw the director of the shelter
that said,

297
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:59,028
"Well, you know, you must be happy,
your sister is on the way."

298
00:25:59,622 --> 00:26:01,991
So I said, "What do you mean?"

299
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,530
He say, "Well, your sister,
you know, from San Antonio,

300
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:09,114
she's on the plane,
she's coming to get you."

301
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:13,489
Fuck, you know. Fuck! Fuck!

302
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,735
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

303
00:26:14,788 --> 00:26:16,412
I'd never left the country.

304
00:26:16,455 --> 00:26:19,027
I didn't know even what it entailed.

305
00:26:23,788 --> 00:26:25,578
I knew Mom couldn't handle the flight.

306
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:27,114
She can't, she couldn't do it.

307
00:26:27,162 --> 00:26:28,572
I have to do this.

308
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,903
I just gotta go get him
and get him back here where he's safe.

309
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:37,288
I should have thought of that.

310
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,786
I should have thought of the consequences.

311
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,906
If you do that, imagine for a second

312
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:47,496
that you're the father of a kid that's
been missing for three years, four months,

313
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,952
and that they find him in Columbia,
er... what would you do?

314
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,989
What would be the first thing you'd do?

315
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:55,572
I would jump on a fucking plane.

316
00:26:58,165 --> 00:27:01,246
I didn't sleep for two days
before I got on the plane.

317
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,406
Fear, but also anticipation,

318
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,496
'cause you want to get there, get there.

319
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,284
You want to see him, hold him,
smell him, just get there.

320
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:15,702
You can't prepare to play a role
of a person that you don't know.

321
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:20,743
I couldn't be Nicholas Barclay
because I didn't know Nicholas Barclay.

322
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:24,448
I didn't even know at that moment
if he was left or right-handed.

323
00:27:25,082 --> 00:27:28,115
So, er, that was a problem.

324
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:32,407
I got on the plane and tried to sleep.

325
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,164
Didn't work.

326
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:58,241
The director...

327
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,285
This is Nick, mwhah.

328
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:12,409
He thought he was an adult.

329
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,575
We called him 13 going on 30.

330
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:18,869
Very difficult to discipline him.

331
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:22,913
If he made up his mind
he was gonna do something,

332
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:26,042
pretty much there wasn't a lot you could do.

333
00:28:27,461 --> 00:28:29,534
Put the lighter down.

334
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:33,833
He'd run away before
for a night or two, mad at Mom.

335
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:36,282
"I'm leaving, I'll find a new mom, a new home.

336
00:28:36,377 --> 00:28:38,119
Kiss my ass," kind of thing.

337
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,078
And he, you know... would leave
and she would hunt him down

338
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:45,244
and find out where he is
and he'd show up the next day.

339
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:52,284
He was not, um, you know,
this perfect nice sweet innocent,

340
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:55,873
he was a very street-smart city boy.

341
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:04,075
- It's nice to meet ya. I am the director.
- In here, Nick.

342
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,200
See, ain't I beautiful?

343
00:29:06,584 --> 00:29:09,252
He had beautiful blond hair.

344
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:12,078
Kind of looked like, erm, a little pixie.

345
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,874
He had blond hair and blue eyes
and a bit of a gap between his teeth.

346
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,992
When he smiled, you could see it.

347
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:46,455
Finally I'm on the ground.
"Who, who, who am I looking for?

348
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:48,459
What do they look like? Are they in suits?

349
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,459
Oh, damn, you can smoke here. Thank God!"

350
00:29:52,713 --> 00:29:54,039
The air smelt different.

351
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:57,251
Erm,
it was a lot less crowded than I thought.

352
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:11,495
I did everything I could
to give myself a chance.

353
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,873
I bought product to color my hair totally blond.

354
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:25,043
The gentlemen and a lady approached me,

355
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,459
'cause I wasn't sure where to go

356
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:30,075
and we went straight into a car
and started driving.

357
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,077
On the flyers it said that Nicholas Barclay
had three tattoos.

358
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,253
There was a girl inside the shelter
that did small tattoos just like that.

359
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:48,287
She was no pro, she was just a kid.

360
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,454
And I asked her to put those tattoos

361
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:52,413
that were on the flyers on me.

362
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:05,751
I was quiet and that's when
the lady started talking to me.

363
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:12,290
She kept my mind busy
with explaining the countryside to me

364
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:14,456
the whole way down there on the drive.

365
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:24,876
I took big sunglasses, I took a hat,
I took a scarf, I took a glove.

366
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,171
I thought that if she couldn't see me,

367
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:29,999
then she wouldn't be able to say
I'm not her brother.

368
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:35,254
We stopped for a Coca-Cola,
which I thought was really cool.

369
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:39,920
They had coke there and it was
the anxiety of how long it was taking.

370
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:46,918
Minutes before she arrived
I was convinced it was finished.

371
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:50,457
That I was gonna get arrested
and maybe beat up also

372
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,746
because they were
not going to be happy about it.

373
00:31:54,256 --> 00:31:56,792
I remember going into like a waiting area.

374
00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:02,002
I'm speaking with a couple of people from
the home saying that he was in his room.

375
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,881
He'd been locked in his room all day.
He wouldn't let anyone go in.

376
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,375
Finally when I heard someone
knocking at the door and saying,

377
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:12,668
"Hey, Nicholas, your sister is downstairs,

378
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:14,922
er... she's waiting for you, she's there..."

379
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,874
I went downstairs
and into like a courtyard.

380
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:21,757
There were some kids playing
like ball against a wall

381
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,965
and looked up at the window
and told him,

382
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,960
"I'm here, come here. I want to see you,
I want to hold you."

383
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:31,670
I remember seeing him look out the window.

384
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,710
I was sure that as soon as the sister
was gonna see me,

385
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:40,090
she was going to say
"What the fuck is that?" You know.

386
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:42,208
That's not... that's not Nicholas.

387
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:49,125
I waited maybe 10 minutes.

388
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:52,756
I knew I was about to lose everything.

389
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,125
I knew I couldn't wait no more,

390
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:56,668
that I couldn't go away,

391
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,588
that I couldn't just disappear,

392
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:01,006
so I opened the door and I went down.

393
00:33:05,928 --> 00:33:09,672
It was just this sense of immense relief.

394
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:14,878
Just seeing, touching,
kissing, holding him.

395
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,298
I said, "What the hell?" You know.

396
00:33:18,385 --> 00:33:21,170
He's here, we're here, I have him.

397
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:25,090
She didn't even wait a second
or two seconds.

398
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,375
She jump on me, she jump on me,

399
00:33:27,427 --> 00:33:29,050
she took me in her arms

400
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:33,467
and she said, "Nicholas, oh, and you
were afraid I wouldn't recognize you.

401
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,382
I would remember that nose."

402
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:40,050
So I just... I remember touching his nose
and telling him, um,

403
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:43,507
"I remember that nose,
you kind of look like your Uncle Pat."

404
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:48,922
She said, "Don't worry," like she always say,
"everything is going to be fine.

405
00:33:48,968 --> 00:33:50,794
Everything is going to be perfect.

406
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,750
I know it's you."

407
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:56,178
He was just... just basically
told me he loved me,

408
00:33:56,221 --> 00:34:01,211
and he didn't say a whole lot
until all the people left.

409
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:06,879
Only God know why she would
do something like that,

410
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:14,751
but... but I know one thing for sure
is there was no other way.

411
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,507
She came for me and she wanted me back.

412
00:34:20,012 --> 00:34:25,842
We went to the visit room
and she showed me dozens of pictures.

413
00:34:26,596 --> 00:34:28,669
Pictures, pictures, pictures.

414
00:34:29,304 --> 00:34:33,250
You remember, this was with Mom
at the, at the house we were living in

415
00:34:33,305 --> 00:34:35,296
before you, you went missing.

416
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:39,002
Remember this was
when you were playing with Scotty.

417
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:41,128
Remember this was...

418
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,092
And he was like, "Jason looks the same,
Codey's gotten pretty big, huh?

419
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:50,967
Mom, God, Mom looks exactly the same.
Has she put on weight?

420
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:54,586
Wanted to know if Grandpa
was still an asshole,

421
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,006
um, told me how much he loved Grandma
and he missed her.

422
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,423
I remember seeing the tattoo,
the cross between his, you know,

423
00:35:02,472 --> 00:35:03,847
right here on his hand.

424
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,052
I just kept thinking
how much he looks like Uncle Pat

425
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:10,428
and how mom was going to be
really surprised how tall he was.

426
00:35:13,098 --> 00:35:15,717
She said that he looked very different,

427
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,885
that he had, you know, grown up...

428
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:22,134
...and erm...

429
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:27,965
he's very quiet,
you know, kinda held back.

430
00:35:28,014 --> 00:35:30,847
He talked with a funny accent.

431
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:34,965
But it was always a whisper and very quiet
like he was hiding from something.

432
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:41,294
I mean, God,
look what he had been through.

433
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,504
He wasn't the same person.

434
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:46,555
He wasn't the same Nicholas
that disappeared four years before.

435
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,717
He had been held and tortured
and God knows what else.

436
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:51,841
He wasn't that same person.

437
00:35:58,266 --> 00:36:02,923
The judge in Linares wanted to make sure
that there was in fact some legal basis

438
00:36:02,973 --> 00:36:08,046
for Nicholas claiming to be er...
Carey Gibson's lost brother.

439
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:15,679
So now the problem was that they
had the sister and the embassy official

440
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:18,758
that were swearing
that I was Nicholas Barclay

441
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,889
and there was the police
and the prosecutor

442
00:36:21,933 --> 00:36:24,884
and the judge
who were not convinced at all.

443
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,302
The judge insisted on separate interviews

444
00:36:27,348 --> 00:36:34,673
and part of the evidence that was in those
interviews was a family photo album.

445
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:39,387
And the judge said, "Listen,
the only way for you to prove

446
00:36:39,432 --> 00:36:42,551
that you're really Nicholas
is we got pictures here

447
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,474
that you've never seen before.

448
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,842
I'm gonna show you five of them."

449
00:36:51,227 --> 00:36:53,300
Number one, OK.

450
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,467
Number two, OK.

451
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:57,140
Number three, OK.

452
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,891
Number four, OK.

453
00:36:58,934 --> 00:37:00,344
On the five one I made a mistake,

454
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,641
but it was too late.

455
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:07,054
She was already convinced
I was Nicholas Barclay.

456
00:37:13,851 --> 00:37:19,600
At that point I didn't see how I could
not document him as a US citizen.

457
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:29,339
I would not have been able to do anything
if Carey didn't show me those pictures.

458
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:35,760
They took picture of me,
with no hat, with nothing.

459
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:38,555
Which was, you know, they saw my eyes.

460
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:44,219
Erm, the constitution of the United States.
I swear to be a US citizen.

461
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:47,929
You know, it wasn't real but I did it.

462
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,178
We didn't do a whole lot of talking
the night before we got on the plane.

463
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:22,173
Not uncomfortable, just silence,
and it was almost like a peaceful silence.

464
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:31,721
You know, I could hear him breathing
and I just felt pretty peaceful.

465
00:38:39,022 --> 00:38:42,517
I'd been thinking about running away
even before I met her.

466
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:54,683
All I got to do was take a taxi cab
and, going to a train station,

467
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,637
buy myself a ticket out of Spain.

468
00:38:58,146 --> 00:39:00,268
I could have done that
in a couple of minutes.

469
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:03,600
Nothing was stopping me, nothing.

470
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:06,313
I went down a few times in the hallway,

471
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:10,764
always wondering if I was doing
the right thing, the wrong thing.

472
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:17,139
Should I go, shouldn't I go,
should I go, shouldn't I go?

473
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:31,435
When I was born,
I don't think there was much love.

474
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:39,053
My mother was very, very young at the time
and she was, she was only 17 years old,

475
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:44,178
met er... older man, which was my father,
from Algeria.

476
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,186
My grandfather was a very racist person

477
00:39:50,232 --> 00:39:54,854
and knowing that the man my mother
spent the night with is an Algerian,

478
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:58,477
he wanted absolutely my mother
to have an abortion.

479
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:01,687
Er, to get rid of me
even before I was born.

480
00:40:04,024 --> 00:40:07,851
For him an Arab should be
dealt with a nuclear weapon

481
00:40:07,898 --> 00:40:09,972
and a black man is a monkey.

482
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:14,477
Before I was born,
I definitely I had the wrong identity.

483
00:40:14,731 --> 00:40:20,514
Er, I already didn't know... I was already
prepared not to know who I really was.

484
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:28,600
A new identity with a real passport,
an American passport.

485
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:30,855
I could go to the US, go to school there.

486
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:35,146
Live with that family
and just being someone.

487
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:39,932
And don't have never again
to worry about being identified.

488
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,141
I saw the opportunity.

489
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:51,728
A woman that could go through so much
to get me with her back in a family

490
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:55,933
which got kids, which seem a fam...
a loving family,

491
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,605
gotta be some... somebody good,

492
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:03,222
You know, I had conflicting rules
inside my own head.

493
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:33,643
Carey want me to be Nicholas
but what about the others?

494
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:35,730
Are they going to want me
to be Nicholas too?

495
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:44,816
I didn't understand why he was so...
like, nervous, you know what I mean?

496
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,356
He was like, you know,
constantly moving and to the bathroom,

497
00:41:48,443 --> 00:41:49,935
and watching people,

498
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:52,308
watching me,
he was always watching me.

499
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:54,643
She was always looking at me.

500
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:58,353
I attested it to him just being scared.

501
00:41:58,442 --> 00:42:00,434
You know, he's going back home

502
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,599
and we don't know what's happened to him,

503
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:05,558
how his mind's working.

504
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:07,896
Um, but he was just...
maybe he was afraid

505
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:12,069
that, that he wouldn't be recognized
or, or Mom wouldn't love him anymore.

506
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:15,318
I'm gonna get killed.

507
00:42:15,362 --> 00:42:17,068
And I want...

508
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:19,860
And I say,
well, maybe the plane better crash.

509
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:25,354
When they said it was time for us
to board, I... nudged Nick and I said,

510
00:42:25,446 --> 00:42:28,442
"You ready? You ready to go home?"
He said, "I'm ready to go home."

511
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:31,687
"Let's get the fuck out of here, and go home."

512
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,144
And we got on the plane.

513
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:59,936
I was really nervous,
anticipation, pretty happy.

514
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,565
You know, we had made it...
It was a family thing, we all went together.

515
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:12,608
I remember that night, minute by minute.

516
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:15,605
It was me, my grandma,

517
00:43:15,656 --> 00:43:18,026
my sister and my dad, I believe.

518
00:43:18,073 --> 00:43:20,193
We all loaded up in my Lincoln

519
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:21,896
to go get my mom and Nicholas.

520
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:29,187
It was a wait and see
but everybody was excited, you know.

521
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:31,313
We didn't know what to expect...

522
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:44,938
I didn't want to go out of the plane.

523
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:47,275
I wanted to wait.

524
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:48,778
I wanted to prepare myself.

525
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,777
I didn't have no plan.
I didn't have no strategy.

526
00:44:05,241 --> 00:44:07,314
I knew there was no way out.

527
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,862
I could not turn back.

528
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:24,606
We had no idea what kind of person
we were getting, who was coming back.

529
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:51,067
I wanted to run and grab and hold him
but he held back.

530
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,193
So I walked down and grabbed his hand
and hugged him and told him I missed him.

531
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:10,527
He had changed so much.

532
00:45:11,118 --> 00:45:13,154
It was like mind-boggling.

533
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:15,526
But then I realized, you know,

534
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:18,906
you tell yourself, well, he's been
through all this horrendous stuff,

535
00:45:18,951 --> 00:45:22,067
so he's absolutely gonna be different.

536
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:29,066
I just remember my kids
and my mom and erm, my husband

537
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:31,154
and just, God, we were so happy.

538
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:37,690
He was like totally covered up,

539
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:42,695
so then I got scared, thinking
that this kid's really messed up,

540
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,691
just by his appearance.

541
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:59,276
He was very quiet and erm, standoffish.

542
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:06,859
I never liked people to touch me.

543
00:46:07,826 --> 00:46:09,901
And I can't change that.

544
00:46:09,952 --> 00:46:12,701
So when she put her hands around me,

545
00:46:12,744 --> 00:46:16,738
she must have felt
that I wasn't enjoying it at all.

546
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:25,902
I was very cold, very closed.
I didn't speak to people.

547
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:34,192
As much as I was happy... I didn't show it.

548
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:45,947
I had a border in front of me.

549
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:47,700
I didn't want to screw up.

550
00:46:53,705 --> 00:47:01,952
Of course, it was welcome with open arms
and let's get you home attitude.

551
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:06,867
Talk about the rest later, you know,
let's just go home.

552
00:47:24,204 --> 00:47:27,038
I just watched him
all the way home in the car

553
00:47:27,122 --> 00:47:29,029
and you could tell he was uneasy.

554
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:34,533
So we put on a tape, tried to make him
as comfortable as possible.

555
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,454
It was a quiet ride home, you know,

556
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:50,443
and everybody, you know,
quiet but yet excited.

557
00:47:57,788 --> 00:48:02,281
I couldn't keep the smile off my face
at that point in time, honestly.

558
00:48:02,997 --> 00:48:05,782
I just had a grin and all the way home.

559
00:48:16,122 --> 00:48:20,579
It was just a happy good feeling that...

560
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:25,234
our long lost Nicholas was home.

561
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,365
I had a family and even more.

562
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:33,074
I never... I never dreamed of so much.

563
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:40,541
I never dreamed to be able to
not only stay in a place where I'm loved

564
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,657
but actually to have a family.

565
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:10,082
When I woke up in Texas country...

566
00:49:11,957 --> 00:49:15,288
.. what I saw wasn't exactly
what I expected to see.

567
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:28,323
The States for me was big city, it was
big buildings and, and people everywhere.

568
00:49:30,499 --> 00:49:34,411
The first thing
when you open your eyes is official,

569
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,581
your name is Nicholas Patrick Barclay,

570
00:49:36,627 --> 00:49:39,115
that you're born December 31st 1980,

571
00:49:39,668 --> 00:49:42,286
and that every family member
is calling me Nicholas

572
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:45,249
and not "Nicholas,
but what is your real name?"

573
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:47,366
No! Nicholas.

574
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,952
"OK, we're going to go shopping, Nicholas."

575
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,700
They drove me around,

576
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:02,166
and, you know,
I knew I had to recognize something,

577
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,665
so... and I also knew that I couldn't
because I'd never been there before.

578
00:50:07,918 --> 00:50:09,707
Hey, Kirk, how are you doin'?

579
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:13,165
We met some people that knew Nicholas
before he disappeared.

580
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,581
I told them I didn't remember them, there
was something but I didn't remember them.

581
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:20,790
Like I had lost my memory,
which is what I told them.

582
00:50:22,708 --> 00:50:24,782
He's traumatized.

583
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,158
That's why he wasn't remembering anything,

584
00:50:27,209 --> 00:50:30,827
because of all, all of the things
that had happened to him.

585
00:50:33,086 --> 00:50:34,663
I remember a sign.

586
00:50:34,712 --> 00:50:40,127
I saw Nicholas in the picture doing this
with his fingers, you know,

587
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,243
his, his way to say "hello", you know,

588
00:50:42,669 --> 00:50:44,743
and I did it a few times with them.

589
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:48,208
When I was there. That was one of
the only things I knew what to do.

590
00:50:50,502 --> 00:50:52,209
I was thinking to myself

591
00:50:52,253 --> 00:50:55,583
that Nicholas Barclay could come back
at his house any day.

592
00:50:56,295 --> 00:50:57,917
That was my first worry.

593
00:50:57,961 --> 00:51:00,035
I was really worried about that.

594
00:51:00,962 --> 00:51:03,912
I couldn't help it.
I said, "Man, what if he show up?"

595
00:51:04,253 --> 00:51:06,624
What if you opened the door
and say, "Hey, I'm back."

596
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,211
You know.

597
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:14,999
We thought the best thing for him
was just to have a normal routine.

598
00:51:15,795 --> 00:51:18,911
You get up, you eat breakfast,
you do this, you eat lunch,

599
00:51:18,961 --> 00:51:23,169
you eat dinner, we'd watch a movie,
just the normal family atmosphere.

600
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:25,496
Me and him hung out.

601
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:30,119
I'd just take him for drives and talk to him
and turn up the music and stuff.

602
00:51:35,547 --> 00:51:37,537
He'd hang out with Codey and his friends

603
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:40,704
and after school
they'd go to the park and play,

604
00:51:40,755 --> 00:51:43,669
and, I mean, they would do
what teenagers do.

605
00:51:43,963 --> 00:51:47,411
He actually kinda started liking a girl
in the neighborhood, Amy.

606
00:51:47,963 --> 00:51:49,586
They would hang out, talk on the phone

607
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:52,663
and he'd kinda get blushy-red
when we talked about her.

608
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:57,833
The only person I hadn't met
in the Barclays' family

609
00:51:57,879 --> 00:52:02,123
was, erm, Jason, his other brother,
the brother of, erm, Carey.

610
00:52:03,047 --> 00:52:05,617
And finally he came to see me.

611
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:11,370
He didn't look at me like Nicholas and he
didn't pretend to look at me like Nicholas

612
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,953
and, er,
he said good luck to me and he left.

613
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:26,961
We didn't even talk about
what had happened to him over there,

614
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,497
because we felt, like, when the time was right
he would open up to us.

615
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:41,337
I did not receive any telephone calls
from the family

616
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:44,296
saying, you know, "Nicholas is back.

617
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,745
Please come over and talk to us.
We need help."

618
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,670
And I felt like it was imperative

619
00:52:49,715 --> 00:52:51,124
that he be interviewed quickly.

620
00:52:52,964 --> 00:52:57,706
So I'd agreed to meet Nicholas
at the San Antonio missing children's centre

621
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,629
to conduct our first interview.

622
00:53:00,506 --> 00:53:04,121
I introduced myself to Nicholas
and then told him why I was there,

623
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:09,209
and that the purpose of this interview
was to get his account of his kidnapping

624
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:12,338
and for his assistance
in locating his abductors.

625
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:15,003
All I knew about Nicholas

626
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,835
was what I had read
on some of the missing posters.

627
00:53:18,883 --> 00:53:21,668
Not that people
can't change in three years,

628
00:53:21,716 --> 00:53:25,047
but this person in general
did not appear to be 16.

629
00:53:26,009 --> 00:53:29,419
He had a shadow of a beard,
a dark beard,

630
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:35,009
that I doubt if Nicholas would have had
a shadow of a dark beard at the age of 16

631
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:36,875
since he had blond hair.

632
00:53:36,924 --> 00:53:39,046
He appeared to be quite nervous

633
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:43,251
and he just seemed very uncomfortable
this entire time.

634
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:54,008
I told them that, um,
I was taken by military overseas

635
00:53:54,051 --> 00:53:56,372
and I was abducted and put in a van,

636
00:53:56,425 --> 00:54:00,003
then fly over to some places
that I never knew where it was.

637
00:54:00,758 --> 00:54:05,628
That, er, we were kept in a room
with different kids.

638
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:06,871
They'd get chloroformed,

639
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:10,293
and, er, they wake up and they're, er...

640
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:14,124
you know, in a place
they don't know where they're at.

641
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:21,964
They were subjected by
high-ranking military to sexual abuse.

642
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:25,383
Every night all of the kids were raped
and molested by men.

643
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:28,379
These men were American,
Mexican and European.

644
00:54:28,426 --> 00:54:34,091
They broke my hands, especially
my right hand, with a baseball bat.

645
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:36,967
They kept burning him
and giving him insects to eat.

646
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:39,214
- We were tortured.
- They broke his fingers.

647
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,127
- His left foot was broken with a crowbar.
- I was raped.

648
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:47,842
They keep these kids in line
by doing military scare tactics.

649
00:54:47,886 --> 00:54:49,260
We were experimented on.

650
00:54:49,302 --> 00:54:51,541
They would put needles in his eyes.

651
00:54:51,593 --> 00:54:56,926
Headphones on their heads screaming
and yelling, er, different languages.

652
00:54:56,968 --> 00:55:01,127
Spanish kept playing over and over
and a voice kept saying, "You are not you."

653
00:55:01,175 --> 00:55:03,214
If he spoke English, he was beaten.

654
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,506
They moved these kids around
in military planes.

655
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,591
We never saw where we were going.

656
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:13,251
The boys' identities were changed
by either changing their hair color,

657
00:55:13,304 --> 00:55:15,590
eye color or other ways.

658
00:55:15,637 --> 00:55:17,046
They were always in uniform.

659
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:18,837
A solution was put in his eyes.

660
00:55:18,885 --> 00:55:20,877
They would sell him for money for sex.

661
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:24,756
His eye color was changed from blue
to brown by the use of this solution.

662
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:27,754
The door wasn't shut and I left by that door.

663
00:55:27,803 --> 00:55:30,885
I ran in the big hallway
and there was another door.

664
00:55:31,803 --> 00:55:33,793
Somehow I managed to go outside

665
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:36,215
and outside I ran, I ran, I ran

666
00:55:36,261 --> 00:55:40,338
and hours after that
I, I discovered that I was in Spain.

667
00:56:12,306 --> 00:56:15,836
We've got a kid here
which is about 14, 15 years old.

668
00:56:15,887 --> 00:56:17,262
He doesn't have no ID.

669
00:56:17,305 --> 00:56:20,256
He's no documents on him
but you can see he's very young.

670
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:22,296
And he's very scared.

671
00:56:26,514 --> 00:56:30,970
She was professional
but you could see that she was horrified.

672
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:36,094
This was a horrendous interview
and when I left I was shaken by it

673
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:40,085
because it had all the horrific,
emotional side effects

674
00:56:40,138 --> 00:56:42,627
that go with listening to such a story.

675
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,294
He knew about this type of activity.

676
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:49,712
I mean, a normal person
doesn't sit down with a story

677
00:56:49,763 --> 00:56:51,836
and make up horrendous...

678
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:54,011
that's not what you lie about.

679
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:58,844
You don't go into detail about torture
and the murdering of children or whatever.

680
00:56:58,890 --> 00:57:00,169
None of that seemed normal.

681
00:57:00,224 --> 00:57:01,966
He was tortured.

682
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:03,806
I mean, he had torture written all...

683
00:57:03,849 --> 00:57:08,305
He had a broken hand
that was never medically attended to,

684
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:10,006
he walked with a limp,

685
00:57:10,056 --> 00:57:16,172
erm, he had cigarette burns down the back
of his head to the back of his ankles.

686
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:21,425
This person is either, erm,
had been the victim himself

687
00:57:21,515 --> 00:57:25,129
or he was a fantastic actor

688
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:28,215
and I didn't
know which of those titles applied to him.

689
00:57:29,765 --> 00:57:32,763
I let them know that I was very sorry
about what had happened

690
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:35,343
and we were going to locate
the people who had done this

691
00:57:35,391 --> 00:57:38,341
and put an end to the trauma
that he had been through.

692
00:57:42,932 --> 00:57:45,385
This was the last border.

693
00:57:45,848 --> 00:57:48,550
It's like you...

694
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,054
I won. You know, the game is over.

695
00:57:52,518 --> 00:57:56,215
I had passports, everybody in the family
say I am Nicholas Barclay.

696
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:58,841
Nobody was investigating me.

697
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,891
Nobody was suspicious that I know.

698
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:08,637
Hell, I was happy.

699
00:58:08,684 --> 00:58:11,303
I was, you know...
I couldn't believe my luck.

700
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:20,890
My name is Charlie Parker.
I'm a private investigator.

701
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:23,054
Hey, how are you doin'?

702
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,671
Say, I want you...
I want you to do something for me.

703
00:58:39,225 --> 00:58:45,935
I got a call back in November and, erm,
from a television producer for Hard Copy

704
00:58:45,977 --> 00:58:48,052
and he said that a boy

705
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:52,143
who had been missing earlier for four years
had turned up

706
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:56,096
and he wanted me to track him down
so they could get an interview with him.

707
00:58:57,852 --> 00:59:01,382
First I had to find out where his mother lived.

708
00:59:01,435 --> 00:59:07,218
Found her and then we drove out to
the north of San Antonio to do the interview.

709
00:59:13,853 --> 00:59:18,308
I had repeatedly asked him,
please do not contact the media.

710
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:21,386
If anything that Nicholas was telling us was true,

711
00:59:21,435 --> 00:59:23,558
if any of it had any accuracy,

712
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:26,683
and if there was any military officer
possibly involved,

713
00:59:26,727 --> 00:59:29,297
the last thing that we wanted it to be put

714
00:59:29,351 --> 00:59:32,019
was on the front page of the newspaper
or on television

715
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:35,840
so that that abductor would know
something about our investigation.

716
00:59:38,227 --> 00:59:40,516
This is Eyewitness News at 10.

717
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:43,806
He disappeared without a trace three years ago.

718
00:59:43,854 --> 00:59:46,307
Tonight a San Antonio boy is back home.

719
00:59:46,354 --> 00:59:49,056
Nicholas Barclay is now 16 years old.

720
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:50,680
He vanished when he was 13...

721
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,186
Nicholas says he was kidnapped

722
00:59:52,229 --> 00:59:53,426
and taken to Spain.

723
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:57,015
He says for three years he was repeatedly
drugged, beaten and raped,

724
00:59:57,062 --> 01:00:00,973
all part of a sex slave operation
involving dozens of missing children.

725
01:00:01,021 --> 01:00:03,852
Well, Bob, the FBI is not taking this case lightly...

726
01:00:03,895 --> 01:00:04,974
The reason?

727
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,688
Somehow a 13-year-old boy from San Antonio

728
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,762
ended up in Spain without a passport.

729
01:00:10,812 --> 01:00:14,722
June 19th 1994,
Nicholas got into a fight with his family,

730
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:17,723
so he came here to Fort Sam Houston
to play basketball.

731
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:20,260
Two young boys approached him,
they started talking.

732
01:00:20,313 --> 01:00:24,352
The next thing he knew, there was a cloth
over his mouth and Nicholas passed out.

733
01:00:25,562 --> 01:00:27,599
He claims his captors
changed his appearance

734
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,434
to make him unrecognizable.

735
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,806
He was no longer allowed to speak English.

736
01:00:31,853 --> 01:00:33,928
Did they rape you all every night?

737
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,146
Me? No.

738
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:39,769
Because they didn't rape me every night.

739
01:00:39,814 --> 01:00:41,971
Some of them, they liked more.

740
01:00:42,023 --> 01:00:43,563
Some of the kids they liked more.

741
01:00:43,606 --> 01:00:47,813
They rape them
usually two or three times a week.

742
01:00:48,022 --> 01:00:53,011
I wanted the media's attention, so that
I would make Nicholas even more real,

743
01:00:53,064 --> 01:00:56,596
that people would really believe
that I'm Nicholas

744
01:00:57,272 --> 01:01:00,224
and they would love me even more for that.

745
01:01:01,897 --> 01:01:05,843
They set him up, put a microphone on him
and had the cameras on him

746
01:01:05,897 --> 01:01:08,764
and I moved over behind a booth.

747
01:01:08,814 --> 01:01:10,888
And it was almost fate.

748
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:14,057
Behind that booth was a picture

749
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:16,180
of the actual Nicholas Barclay.

750
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:21,021
And I could look at that picture
and look at him at the same time.

751
01:01:21,314 --> 01:01:26,303
And as I looked at the picture, I noticed
that the boy had blue-grey-looking eyes

752
01:01:26,356 --> 01:01:28,346
and this man had brown eyes.

753
01:01:30,524 --> 01:01:33,523
Here was a moment where the hair
stood up on the back of your neck,

754
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:36,600
and, and er... there was
just something wrong about it.

755
01:01:37,067 --> 01:01:39,187
I did what they wanted me to do.

756
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:42,645
Something was wrong. I said,
"Can you get me a picture of his ears?"

757
01:01:42,691 --> 01:01:44,397
I need to get... get that.

758
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:51,600
And I had read about Scotland Yard
using that method to trace down a man,

759
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:55,100
James Earl Ray,
that had killed Martin Luther King.

760
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:58,562
They had caught him in Heathrow Airport
by identifying his ears.

761
01:01:58,608 --> 01:02:05,138
And I knew the ears were a means of identity,
almost like fingerprints.

762
01:02:07,192 --> 01:02:09,645
I put the picture in my pocket and took it...

763
01:02:11,525 --> 01:02:12,897
When I got back to the office,

764
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:15,346
I put the pictures in Adobe Photoshop.

765
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,149
They, they were different ears.

766
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:27,852
And so I knew right away

767
01:02:27,902 --> 01:02:31,398
that absolutely he was not Nicholas Barclay.

768
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:34,896
I thought I had a spy.

769
01:02:34,944 --> 01:02:37,562
I thought I had real, honest to God spy.

770
01:02:37,984 --> 01:02:42,854
Why else would a guy come here
and take the place of another person?

771
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,275
What would be his reason?

772
01:02:46,693 --> 01:02:48,767
I phoned Nancy Fisher.

773
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,477
I said, "This guy's a fake. It's not him."

774
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:54,184
I said, "The ears don't match."

775
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:55,775
And my comment to him was,

776
01:02:57,651 --> 01:02:58,930
"You need to be very careful

777
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,520
that you don't intrude
on the federal investigation."

778
01:03:01,818 --> 01:03:05,185
People aren't used to hearing
you talk about somebody's ears

779
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:08,730
and I think she was taken aback by that.
She didn't know what I was talking about.

780
01:03:08,776 --> 01:03:11,394
I thought I didn't have a right to question,

781
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:14,274
you know, their statement
that this was their family member

782
01:03:14,317 --> 01:03:17,267
because how, how could they be wrong?

783
01:03:17,317 --> 01:03:20,020
I mean, no-one would be wrong
about something like that.

784
01:03:20,068 --> 01:03:23,649
What do they want? I've already got
the fact he doesn't have the same ears.

785
01:03:24,112 --> 01:03:27,394
Why would you ever,
ever take in a stranger?

786
01:03:27,445 --> 01:03:29,435
Not just a stranger from this country

787
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:32,982
but a stranger from another country
who speaks with a French accent.

788
01:03:33,028 --> 01:03:35,184
This has to be Nicholas Barclay.

789
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:39,974
It was an outrageous thing.

790
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:45,026
I cannot have talked to anyone
that hasn't read about this

791
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:50,485
that has said, "Wait a minute.
I know my own kid. I know my own son.

792
01:03:50,569 --> 01:03:52,690
I can look in his eyes and tell..."

793
01:03:52,736 --> 01:03:56,777
It's like when you go to a class reunion

794
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:59,605
and you see the kids
you went to school with in 19...

795
01:04:20,946 --> 01:04:25,154
It really began for me, the American dream,
when I took that big yellow bus

796
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:28,527
to go to school
with others, with other students.

797
01:04:34,446 --> 01:04:39,684
How many French adults
go to American schools for kids,

798
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:41,065
into a yellow bus...

799
01:04:48,196 --> 01:04:52,024
That was impossible. You could do that
in a movie, you could do that in a...

800
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:53,730
but you can't do that for real.

801
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:06,061
I finally succeeded to become a kid again,
officially, with a passport,

802
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:07,653
to have a second chance,

803
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:11,738
to be able this time to go to school
and to succeed this time.

804
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:27,566
Well, he started back to high school.

805
01:05:27,613 --> 01:05:28,775
I really was worried.

806
01:05:28,822 --> 01:05:31,359
I didn't know what he was going to do.

807
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:34,025
This was a case. I mean, a real case.

808
01:05:34,823 --> 01:05:37,904
This guy was lying
about who he said he was

809
01:05:37,948 --> 01:05:40,022
and here the family was accepting him.

810
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:44,232
I expected him any day to blow up
something at the airbase

811
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:46,734
or do something at the army base.

812
01:05:49,865 --> 01:05:53,692
I was pulling teeth trying to determine
who had kidnapped Nicholas,

813
01:05:53,739 --> 01:05:56,062
when and where
and under what circumstances.

814
01:05:56,864 --> 01:05:58,819
I had almost no information

815
01:05:58,863 --> 01:06:02,111
because all the information he gave us
was very, very general.

816
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:04,609
He couldn't give names,
he couldn't give places,

817
01:06:04,656 --> 01:06:07,029
he couldn't give times,
he couldn't give anything.

818
01:06:08,575 --> 01:06:13,032
The family was told that the reason
we were taking Nicholas to Houston

819
01:06:13,075 --> 01:06:14,982
was because he'd been through trauma.

820
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:19,407
So he deserved to see a forensic expert
to deal with the trauma.

821
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:28,484
Initially I thought that this was
going to be a forensic interview,

822
01:06:28,533 --> 01:06:32,574
er, with the intent of finding out
more information

823
01:06:32,617 --> 01:06:34,572
about the people who abducted him.

824
01:06:38,117 --> 01:06:44,860
Here was this pale white kid
and I introduced myself

825
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:49,233
and, as he spoke back, immediately my...

826
01:06:49,283 --> 01:06:51,522
Something in me just said,
this is not right,

827
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:53,151
there's something wrong here.

828
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:55,439
I speak with him for a long time.

829
01:06:55,491 --> 01:06:59,355
He asked me to repeat all the stories
I'd been telling everybody.

830
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:02,776
I remember people grabbing me
and putting me in the van.

831
01:07:02,827 --> 01:07:07,449
I went to sleep and I woke up in a room.
There was other kids...

832
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:10,694
I didn't see the same physiological change

833
01:07:10,743 --> 01:07:17,699
in his body posture,
in his pupil size, in his heart rate,

834
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,200
that I would normally see

835
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,360
with somebody who's talking about
a traumatic experience.

836
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:31,825
He couldn't speak English
without an accent.

837
01:07:31,868 --> 01:07:36,821
That told me about the development of his brain,
and the development of language.

838
01:07:38,952 --> 01:07:44,367
You just cannot be raised for
the first six, seven years of your life

839
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:48,783
in an English-speaking home

840
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:53,399
and later on, you know,
eight, nine years later,

841
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:56,404
even 10 years later,

842
01:07:56,453 --> 01:07:59,121
not be able to speak English
without an accent.

843
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:06,865
I can guarantee you that this kid was
not raised in an English-speaking family.

844
01:08:08,578 --> 01:08:11,990
You know, I don't know who he is
but the person who was... I was interviewing

845
01:08:12,036 --> 01:08:14,157
could not have been Nicholas Barclay.

846
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:20,156
OK, the worst scenario
just showed up and I don't like that.

847
01:08:21,495 --> 01:08:23,900
This investigation did a 90 degree.

848
01:08:23,953 --> 01:08:27,568
It just went from one, one place
all the way up to another.

849
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:31,029
I immediately called Carey Gibson
and I said to her,

850
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:35,203
"Carey, Dr Perry has just stated
that this person cannot be your brother,

851
01:08:35,246 --> 01:08:37,733
for the fact
that he cannot be an American.

852
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,786
This could be a very dangerous person."

853
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:48,525
She shrieked or screamed
and said, "Oh, my gosh!"

854
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:53,159
So I said, "Don't be at the airport," you know.

855
01:08:53,205 --> 01:08:56,037
"I'll handle it. I will take care of this individual"

856
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,486
and that she did not have to take him home,

857
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:00,660
you know, back to her home to live with them

858
01:09:00,706 --> 01:09:03,110
and she says, "OK, OK."

859
01:09:07,996 --> 01:09:14,408
We fly back into San Antonio
and there's Carey standing there.

860
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:16,909
What?

861
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:24,073
She acted like we'd
never had that conversation.

862
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:28,365
And she acted excited to see him,
asked him how his trip was.

863
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,404
I think I just stared for a minute...

864
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:36,070
And I called the US Attorneys' Office
right then and there

865
01:09:36,121 --> 01:09:38,112
and I said, "What do I do?"

866
01:09:39,289 --> 01:09:44,407
And the Assistant US Attorney said,
"Let him return to her temporarily."

867
01:09:45,913 --> 01:09:49,198
She welcomed this person home
just like he was her brother.

868
01:09:49,249 --> 01:09:53,195
I didn't have any clue
as to why she behaved in this manner.

869
01:09:53,582 --> 01:09:55,868
Because in my conversation with her,

870
01:09:55,915 --> 01:09:58,664
I had said,
"This person is not your brother."

871
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:03,658
I don't think... I don't remember her
putting it in those words.

872
01:10:03,707 --> 01:10:07,155
Well, maybe they wanted him so badly
to be their son

873
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:08,996
that they said he was their son,

874
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,742
but it was starting to get ridiculous.

875
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:19,612
I couldn't let it go. There was no way
in the world I could let it go.

876
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,696
I started going into the neighborhood,

877
01:10:23,749 --> 01:10:25,823
and finding out about
the real Nicholas Barclay,

878
01:10:25,874 --> 01:10:27,580
interviewing the neighbors,

879
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:30,988
trying to find out
what I could about that boy

880
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:32,782
and about that family.

881
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:34,656
And what's going on?

882
01:10:34,706 --> 01:10:36,911
You know, why would Nicholas have left?

883
01:10:36,957 --> 01:10:39,954
The police used to usually come

884
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:44,493
maybe like twice or three times a month.

885
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:47,576
Either it was argument with the kids

886
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:50,956
or with their boyfriend or with the other son.

887
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:57,873
I spoke to everyone and they all said
that Nicholas had caused trouble,

888
01:10:57,916 --> 01:10:59,707
had come home late at night.

889
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:02,073
We've all had arguments in our family,

890
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,997
but it's rare that we call the police,

891
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:06,163
that it is so bad that they have to come.

892
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:09,784
It, it made me think
there was something going on,

893
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:12,038
more than meets the eye. Of course it did.

894
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:21,246
I knew that DNA samples would prove
that he wasn't Nicholas Barclay.

895
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:28,536
Mrs. Dollarhide said, "This is my son.

896
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:31,784
I don't have to provide blood samples
for you for DNA

897
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:33,456
and she laid down on the floor,

898
01:11:33,499 --> 01:11:35,574
literally laid down on the floor,

899
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:39,037
and said, "No, and you can't pick me up,
and you can't make me."

900
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:44,746
I did not want to go anywhere with the FBI,
but I don't remember refusing.

901
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:47,706
I was stunned.
I've never had that reaction before.

902
01:11:47,753 --> 01:11:50,241
She wasn't just apathetic,
she was hostile.

903
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:56,748
To be honest with you, I really have
no idea what I was thinking at that time.

904
01:11:56,794 --> 01:12:01,498
My main goal in life was not, not to think.

905
01:12:03,877 --> 01:12:06,791
We didn't need to prove who he was.
We knew who he was.

906
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:15,044
I no longer saw them as a grieving erm...
victimized family.

907
01:12:15,086 --> 01:12:18,084
I saw them as a very questionable family.

908
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:23,415
There would be no reason for them
to accept a stranger into their lives...

909
01:12:24,876 --> 01:12:27,163
..unless there was something to hide.

910
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,034
That would be the only reason.

911
01:12:29,085 --> 01:12:32,168
Something was being hidden
and I didn't know what that was.

912
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:45,500
When Beverly refused
to give her blood sample,

913
01:12:45,546 --> 01:12:48,626
I started to become suspicious.

914
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,622
They knew that I wasn't Nicholas.

915
01:12:53,463 --> 01:12:55,583
Whatever I was telling them,

916
01:12:57,754 --> 01:12:59,709
they didn't believe a word of it.

917
01:12:59,754 --> 01:13:01,543
But they were good at not showing it.

918
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,788
I mean, who wouldn't see it?

919
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:13,086
That's about four, five years ago now.

920
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:16,665
I remember in Spain,
Carey did everything for me.

921
01:13:19,045 --> 01:13:20,952
When I didn't know something, she told me.

922
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,919
"You forgot everything
but you're going to remember it now

923
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:30,120
and, you know, this was Mom at the place
we're living in with... Do you remember?

924
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:34,582
Oh, this was Chantelle. You remember
Chantelle. That's your niece, my daughter.

925
01:13:34,632 --> 01:13:37,962
Do you remember that? Do you
remember that? Do you remember that?"

926
01:13:38,006 --> 01:13:39,913
Over and over and over again.

927
01:13:39,965 --> 01:13:41,161
That's Jason.

928
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,962
She wanted to put it in my head.

929
01:13:44,005 --> 01:13:46,873
She wanted to put it in my head
so I would never forget.

930
01:13:47,964 --> 01:13:51,045
She just could not say it's not Nicholas.

931
01:13:51,089 --> 01:13:52,997
Did she believe it or not?

932
01:13:53,046 --> 01:13:54,374
If you asked me, I would say,

933
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:57,088
no, not for a second
did she believe I was her brother.

934
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:00,411
She decided I was gonna be her brother.

935
01:14:02,172 --> 01:14:04,496
It's like I woke up in a place where...

936
01:14:06,131 --> 01:14:08,454
Lies even bigger than what I did.

937
01:14:08,506 --> 01:14:10,082
You know, it's...

938
01:14:10,922 --> 01:14:15,828
they pretended as much as I did
and even more.

939
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:27,373
I kept thinking about the kid,
Nicholas Barclay.

940
01:14:37,839 --> 01:14:39,249
At the time of his disappearance,

941
01:14:39,299 --> 01:14:42,795
he was living with Beverly
in the house on Swallow Street

942
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:45,874
and his brother Jason
was also living there.

943
01:14:52,174 --> 01:14:53,501
Jason, Nick's older brother,

944
01:14:53,548 --> 01:14:55,255
when he moved into their house,

945
01:14:55,299 --> 01:14:56,543
that house changed,

946
01:14:56,590 --> 01:14:57,965
because before he got there,

947
01:14:58,008 --> 01:14:59,251
Nick and his mom

948
01:14:59,299 --> 01:15:01,042
seemed pretty close to me.

949
01:15:02,384 --> 01:15:04,005
She loved him to death.

950
01:15:04,049 --> 01:15:08,836
I mean, she loved him, you could tell...
She, she... He was the light of her life.

951
01:15:09,841 --> 01:15:13,288
This guy moved in,
he was a bum, a drug addict

952
01:15:13,382 --> 01:15:14,923
and he only cared about himself.

953
01:15:15,007 --> 01:15:18,706
And when he got into that house,
it just made things that much more worse.

954
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,919
In fact, I think it even pushed his mom
into doing drugs herself

955
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:24,592
when he moved into the house.

956
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:27,752
That house just became
a volatile situation altogether.

957
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:33,214
I discovered from the police files,

958
01:15:33,258 --> 01:15:35,829
a couple of months
after the disappearance,

959
01:15:36,426 --> 01:15:38,796
that Jason had called the police

960
01:15:38,842 --> 01:15:42,588
and said that his brother
had tried to break into the house.

961
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:48,087
Well, we see that kind of thing all the time.

962
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:51,380
People, people
are constantly doing stuff like that

963
01:15:51,425 --> 01:15:54,673
to make people think that person's alive.

964
01:15:58,176 --> 01:15:59,751
I started to put two and two together

965
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,751
and I thought something happened
inside that house to that boy.

966
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:13,711
I didn't need to be Columbo
to put all the pieces together.

967
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:18,044
They killed him.

968
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,714
Some of them did it, some of them knew of it,
and some of them chose to ignore it.

969
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:32,218
I wasn't worried about
Nicholas coming back no more.

970
01:16:36,428 --> 01:16:39,793
Neither Nicholas Barclay
or his mother were cooperating,

971
01:16:39,844 --> 01:16:43,175
so we were going to have to have
a search warrant executed

972
01:16:43,219 --> 01:16:45,885
in order to obtain those blood samples.

973
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:52,419
I couldn't pretend no more to be Nicholas
and act like Nicholas.

974
01:16:53,678 --> 01:16:57,125
I took two or three other agents with me
to go pick him up.

975
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:04,958
So inside me, I started getting,
you know, more and more aggressive,

976
01:17:05,552 --> 01:17:06,831
weird.

977
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:08,969
I couldn't go on.

978
01:17:09,763 --> 01:17:12,678
We got the fingerprints
and we got the palm prints.

979
01:17:12,722 --> 01:17:16,585
Within a few weeks, we would be sending
them out to Interpol, to the embassies,

980
01:17:16,638 --> 01:17:18,594
to see if any of these fingerprints

981
01:17:18,638 --> 01:17:21,506
matched anything that they had on record.

982
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:23,343
I was trying to find a way out,

983
01:17:23,429 --> 01:17:26,427
not only a way out in San Antonio, Texas,

984
01:17:26,471 --> 01:17:28,675
but a way out, out of my mind.

985
01:17:29,221 --> 01:17:32,587
Nicholas was becoming
much more agitated and angry

986
01:17:32,638 --> 01:17:35,470
and I really felt like
he was going to run away

987
01:17:35,512 --> 01:17:38,629
and if he ran away we might have
a very hard time locating him.

988
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:42,138
I started tailing him,
I started following him.

989
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:45,711
I started sitting up on Beverly's place
where she lived

990
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:49,921
and writing down license numbers of
all the cars that came to her, to see her.

991
01:17:51,846 --> 01:17:55,921
So I took a razor blade
and I slit my face.

992
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,134
Everything was snowballing
and snowballing and snowballing.

993
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:02,841
I show them, show them that

994
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:05,425
I was under a great deal of pressure.

995
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:07,511
On March 3rd of 1998,

996
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:11,301
the legate in Madrid, Spain, called me

997
01:18:11,348 --> 01:18:14,132
and he said, "We've just identified him."

998
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:15,674
And I said, "You're kidding?"

999
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:20,842
I knew that everything was going down
and it was just a matter of weeks.

1000
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:25,842
He said, "What I'm gonna do right now
is fax to you the records that I have."

1001
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:29,505
He agreed to meet with me.

1002
01:18:29,556 --> 01:18:31,428
We ordered hot cakes.

1003
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,175
And we started to eat.

1004
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:36,131
And he said...

1005
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,551
I said,
"You really made your mother angry."

1006
01:18:38,598 --> 01:18:41,715
And he said,
"She's not my mother and you know it."

1007
01:18:42,683 --> 01:18:44,506
And I thought, well, I'll be damned.

1008
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:47,129
And so I stood over the fax machine,

1009
01:18:48,889 --> 01:18:51,424
waiting for, of course, them to come in

1010
01:18:51,472 --> 01:18:53,713
because I was screaming
and jumping up and down.

1011
01:18:55,889 --> 01:18:57,880
I actually said, "Well, I'll be damned,

1012
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:00,422
you're going to finally tell me
who you are."

1013
01:19:02,683 --> 01:19:06,925
I was like doing a dance
and everybody was high-fiving.

1014
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:10,470
It was like, you know, we finally,
we finally know who this person is.

1015
01:19:12,683 --> 01:19:17,056
And my heart was beating fast,
just like it is now thinking about it.

1016
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,512
And... And I said, "Who are you?"

1017
01:19:20,558 --> 01:19:23,722
He said, "I'm Frederic Bourdin
and I'm wanted by Interpol."

1018
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:28,473
The fingerprint cards told me

1019
01:19:28,516 --> 01:19:31,846
that he was not 16, he was 23.

1020
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:34,880
That he was not American, he was French.

1021
01:19:35,142 --> 01:19:38,141
That he was not Nicholas Barclay,
he was Frederic Bourdin.

1022
01:19:38,849 --> 01:19:41,801
We grow up in America thinking Interpol

1023
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:45,429
is kind of the God of the cops.
You follow me?

1024
01:19:45,475 --> 01:19:48,044
That's the highest step you can get
in "Copland".

1025
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:50,303
And so I thought, Jesus Christ,

1026
01:19:50,349 --> 01:19:53,718
if he's wanted by Interpol,
what has he done? You know.

1027
01:19:53,768 --> 01:19:55,759
There is no limit to what he's done.

1028
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,351
So he began to tell me.

1029
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,931
Frederic Bourdin is delinquent.

1030
01:20:02,977 --> 01:20:05,051
Activities and modus operandi...

1031
01:20:13,935 --> 01:20:15,593
He has travelled throughout Europe

1032
01:20:15,642 --> 01:20:17,135
appearing at shelters for minors

1033
01:20:17,185 --> 01:20:18,642
under different aliases.

1034
01:20:19,476 --> 01:20:21,266
Spain, 1992.

1035
01:20:22,727 --> 01:20:25,049
Spain, September 1993.

1036
01:20:29,144 --> 01:20:30,173
Barcelona...

1037
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:33,344
.. stated that he'd run away
from his adoptive parents' house.

1038
01:20:33,436 --> 01:20:35,508
Brussels, '95.

1039

01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,591
Milan, 1993.

1041
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:44,090
Glasgow.

1042
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:47,057
I sat there. I could hardly eat,
I could hardly swallow my food.

1043
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:54,015
He always wore glasses.

1044
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,218
Giovanni Petrullo.

1045
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:58,344

Spain, 1997.

1058
01:21:20,437 --> 01:21:22,806
It's possible he may need psychiatric help.

1059
01:21:27,604 --> 01:21:28,932
Settle in tonight

1060
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,933
because we are about to share with you

1061
01:21:30,978 --> 01:21:32,554
a story so bizarre,

1062
01:21:32,603 --> 01:21:34,676
it's hard to believe it's true.

1063
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:37,263
This is the tale of a master imposter

1064
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:40,677
who managed to lie his way
into the United States

1065
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:44,096
and prey upon
the most vulnerable of people.

1066
01:21:44,147 --> 01:21:46,221
He is the only person in US history

1067
01:21:46,272 --> 01:21:49,803
ever to have assumed
the identity of a missing child.

1068
01:21:50,023 --> 01:21:52,806
He fooled even the lost boy's mother.

1069
01:21:52,856 --> 01:21:55,558
It's hard to imagine
how he could have gotten away with it.

1070
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:22,469
We knew it was going to be,
you know, heart-wrenching and...

1071
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:24,934
you know...

1072
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:26,971
but we never thought it wouldn't be him.

1073
01:22:27,814 --> 01:22:30,182
You know, why would you even think that?

1074
01:22:30,230 --> 01:22:32,469
The first feeling was complete sadness.

1075
01:22:32,687 --> 01:22:35,176
Because it wasn't Nicholas.

1076
01:22:35,229 --> 01:22:37,220
Which took us back to square one.

1077
01:22:37,271 --> 01:22:39,596
Where is Nicholas?

1078
01:22:39,649 --> 01:22:41,723
That was the first one.

1079
01:22:43,315 --> 01:22:46,100
The second emotion was,

1080
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:51,730
how could I be so fucking stupid?

1081
01:22:51,773 --> 01:22:53,597
I mean, seriously.

1082
01:22:57,565 --> 01:23:01,261
I contacted the SAPD,
the San Antonio Police Department,

1083
01:23:01,315 --> 01:23:05,474
and told them, decided to tell them,
that, hey, they killed him.

1084
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,929
Based upon Frederic Bourdin's allegations,

1085
01:23:12,731 --> 01:23:16,311
a homicide investigation was opened

1086
01:23:16,357 --> 01:23:20,054
and the allegation
was against the family members

1087
01:23:20,107 --> 01:23:24,645
as being... participating in
the disappearance of the child.

1088
01:23:24,689 --> 01:23:29,181
It was related to us
that while Frederic was in jail

1089
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:31,933
that he said that my mom confessed to him

1090
01:23:31,981 --> 01:23:34,935
that her and Jason
killed Nicholas and hid the body.

1091
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:38,692
They accused me first

1092
01:23:41,109 --> 01:23:43,183
and it totally freaked me out.

1093
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:50,227
Because I, I... have been crazy
but never violent.

1094
01:23:52,483 --> 01:23:57,105
This is the street the kid lived on
when he went missing.

1095
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:06,016
There's the house right there.

1096
01:24:10,109 --> 01:24:12,016
I think the boy's buried here.

1097
01:24:14,567 --> 01:24:17,648
I want to talk to Darryl inside.

1098
01:24:17,692 --> 01:24:24,103
He's agreed to let me dig
and see if Nicholas Barclay's here.

1099
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:29,101
If Beverly knew that this individual
was not her son,

1100
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:31,985
then she had to have
some type of ulterior motive

1101
01:24:32,027 --> 01:24:36,022
and it had to be something very scary

1102
01:24:36,069 --> 01:24:39,766
for her to accept a stranger
into her household

1103
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,276
posing as her own son.

1104
01:24:41,319 --> 01:24:43,439
I agreed to take a lie detector test.

1105
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:46,725
She passed the polygraph.

1106
01:24:47,694 --> 01:24:50,895
And I said to the polygraph examiner,

1107
01:24:50,944 --> 01:24:52,602
"I don't understand this,

1108
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:55,354
I don't understand it at all.
Will you give it to her again?"

1109
01:25:02,318 --> 01:25:05,732
So he gave it to her again
and she passed the polygraph.

1110
01:25:05,777 --> 01:25:08,811
I said, "No, there is something wrong."

1111
01:25:11,235 --> 01:25:13,308
The third time he gave it to her,

1112
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,854
she flunked every question.

1113
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,275
I mean, like, big-time.

1114
01:25:17,317 --> 01:25:21,181
The polygrapher said the machine
practically jumped off the table.

1115
01:25:21,985 --> 01:25:25,768
Her answers appeared to be
false on everything.

1116
01:25:29,446 --> 01:25:31,069
And he turned to her and he said,

1117
01:25:31,113 --> 01:25:35,521
"Mrs. Dollarhide, it appears
that you know where your son is.

1118
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:39,894
It appears that you know what happened
to him" and some other questions.

1119
01:25:40,153 --> 01:25:43,234
And that's when she became
very aggravated, very agitated,

1120
01:25:43,278 --> 01:25:45,104
jumped up and ran out and was screaming.

1121
01:25:48,445 --> 01:25:52,688
I lied about being... stealing,

1122
01:25:54,862 --> 01:25:57,860
and I had... so that's why I failed.

1123
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:02,275
I didn't lie about anything
to do with Nicholas.

1124
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:04,229
It was the other questions.

1125
01:26:05,654 --> 01:26:07,525
- Darryl? Charlie Parker.
- Mr. Parker.

1126
01:26:07,571 --> 01:26:09,643
How are you doin'?

1127
01:26:10,112 --> 01:26:11,308
It's nice in here.

1128
01:26:11,362 --> 01:26:12,818
So this is the house, huh?

1129
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:14,236
Yes, sir.

1130
01:26:14,279 --> 01:26:19,614
The polygraph led us to believe
that she did have some information...

1131
01:26:21,739 --> 01:26:25,863
...she could provide that she refused to
and we felt like Jason had information.

1132
01:26:26,531 --> 01:26:31,104
If Jason did something to Nicholas,
I didn't know about it

1133
01:26:31,156 --> 01:26:35,859
and I can't imagine Jason ever doing that.

1134
01:26:35,904 --> 01:26:38,275
It's just not in his makeup,

1135
01:26:41,448 --> 01:26:44,315
but... I don't know.

1136
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:52,190
I know my brother or my mother did not
kill Nicholas, accidentally, on purpose.

1137
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,774
Whatever Frederic said, it never happened.

1138
01:26:55,573 --> 01:27:00,313
When we first got my dog, he was always
digging in the back corner over there

1139
01:27:00,364 --> 01:27:01,738
where the, the tree is.

1140
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:06,521
And one day I was mowing
and saw, like, pieces of, like, plastic,

1141
01:27:06,572 --> 01:27:08,976
- kind of like a tarp kind of material...
- OK.

1142
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,897
...sticking out of the ground.
I tried to pull it up to get it out,

1143
01:27:11,947 --> 01:27:14,863
and it just kept ripping on me
as it was stuck in the ground.

1144
01:27:14,908 --> 01:27:17,479
So I never paid any attention to it
or gave it any thought,

1145
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:19,938
until last night when we were speaking
on the phone.

1146
01:27:20,992 --> 01:27:23,195
And the bush has been there a while?

1147
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:30,322
I had initially tried to get a hold of
Jason prior to Frederic's arrest

1148
01:27:30,364 --> 01:27:31,609
and couldn't.

1149
01:27:32,698 --> 01:27:35,614
And then when I finally did
get a hold of him,

1150
01:27:35,658 --> 01:27:38,324
I asked him
about the disappearance of his brother.

1151
01:27:39,282 --> 01:27:44,520
He just seemed totally apathetic about
the disappearance of his younger brother.

1152
01:27:44,573 --> 01:27:45,948
Extremely apathetic.

1153
01:27:45,991 --> 01:27:49,191
And didn't care that he'd been returned

1154
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,568
but when he did see him,

1155
01:27:50,615 --> 01:27:52,239
no, that wasn't his brother,

1156
01:27:52,282 --> 01:27:55,150
but he didn't seem interested enough
or excited enough

1157
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:58,197
to tell his mother and sister,
"That's not my brother.

1158
01:27:58,241 --> 01:28:00,859
No, no, they just wanted to believe."

1159
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:04,150
Yeah, it's a good spot. Let's see.

1160
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:06,272
Say he dumps him here first...

1161
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:10,784
...and then, if he looks up,

1162
01:28:12,326 --> 01:28:15,194
yeah, yeah, this is good, this is good.

1163
01:28:15,243 --> 01:28:19,107
He was very hostile,
refused to help in any way,

1164
01:28:19,159 --> 01:28:23,154
and then he later left
the drug rehabilitation centre

1165
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:26,695
and was found having died
from a drug overdose.

1166
01:28:27,117 --> 01:28:30,982
I think that Jason became a perfect scapegoat
because he's not here.

1167
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,820
He died,

1168
01:28:34,868 --> 01:28:39,903
so he can't be questioned
or, you know, anything.

1169
01:28:42,075 --> 01:28:44,990
I mean,
he can't, he can't even defend himself.

1170
01:28:54,116 --> 01:28:57,234
It's kinda like a nightmare.

1171
01:28:57,534 --> 01:29:02,689
All this stuff is coming at you and none
of it's true but nobody believes you.

1172
01:29:02,742 --> 01:29:05,447
Or they think that you had
something to do with it.

1173
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:11,443
And it's like getting in trouble
for something you didn't do.

1174
01:29:13,994 --> 01:29:17,989
You know, when kids tell you,
"I didn't do it!"

1175
01:29:18,036 --> 01:29:20,109
You're going, "Yeah, right."

1176
01:29:22,368 --> 01:29:24,443
But I didn't do it.

1177
01:29:27,035 --> 01:29:30,732
I do feel like the family knows
the whereabouts of Nicholas Barclay.

1178
01:29:30,785 --> 01:29:34,945
I think that Beverly Dollarhide
and Jason Dollarhide knew at one time

1179
01:29:34,994 --> 01:29:37,483
what happened to Nicholas Barclay.

1180
01:29:37,537 --> 01:29:39,241
Show me one piece of evidence,

1181
01:29:39,285 --> 01:29:42,948
show me one thing that will lock
anybody in our family up over this,

1182
01:29:42,995 --> 01:29:46,774
just one shred of actual proof.

1183
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:49,032
Back here. Let's go back here.

1184
01:29:53,785 --> 01:29:57,150
The biggest,
funniest one to me, hilarious,

1185
01:29:57,702 --> 01:30:00,489
is that we went and picked up
a complete stranger

1186
01:30:00,538 --> 01:30:03,572
to hide the fact that we killed Nicholas

1187
01:30:03,621 --> 01:30:06,192
or someone in my family killed Nicholas.

1188
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:09,493
When through four years
that Nicholas was disappeared,

1189
01:30:09,538 --> 01:30:11,824
we were the only ones looking for him.

1190
01:30:11,871 --> 01:30:17,322
Why would we go pick up a stranger to hide
something that didn't need to be hidden?

1191
01:30:27,037 --> 01:30:29,112
Just another one of his lies.

1192
01:30:32,704 --> 01:30:34,244
Even from behind bars,

1193
01:30:34,287 --> 01:30:37,654
he continued to lie to families
of other missing children.

1194
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:40,280
From this phone in his cell,

1195
01:30:40,331 --> 01:30:42,320
Bourdin made hundreds of collect calls

1196
01:30:42,371 --> 01:30:45,403
claiming to have information
about lost children.

1197
01:30:46,037 --> 01:30:47,578
He even said he could help solve

1198
01:30:47,621 --> 01:30:50,323
the highly publicized case
of Sabrina Aisenberg,

1199
01:30:50,371 --> 01:30:54,115
an infant who was taken from her home
in Tampa, Florida, last year.

1200
01:30:57,874 --> 01:30:59,946
No.

1201
01:31:04,582 --> 01:31:05,991
Yes.

1202
01:31:11,538 --> 01:31:13,080
He's a habitual liar

1203
01:31:13,123 --> 01:31:14,864
and it blows my mind

1204
01:31:14,914 --> 01:31:20,863
that anybody can take anything
that is said out of his mouth as truth.

1205
01:31:24,623 --> 01:31:26,993
What? This kid comes
and says he's Nicholas,

1206
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:28,365
and then turns around and says,

1207
01:31:28,414 --> 01:31:31,366
"You... these people
that took care of me killed him."

1208
01:31:31,414 --> 01:31:34,082
Hm.
How do you come up with that conclusion?

1209
01:31:34,124 --> 01:31:36,658
He put us through enough already

1210
01:31:36,706 --> 01:31:40,486
and then for him to do this
while he's in jail for what he's done

1211
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:42,743
and to cause more pain to our family?

1212
01:31:43,746 --> 01:31:44,991
Fuck him.

1213
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:12,533
I didn't give a damn what other people
were thinking, or what they were feeling.

1214
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:15,747
I care about myself, just about myself...

1215
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,322
...and fuck the rest of it.

1216
01:32:21,305 --> 01:33:21,328
