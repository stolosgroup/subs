<i>Now time for the man
you've all been waiting for.</i>

7
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,150
<i>He is the king
of the high street.</i>

8
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:45,287
<i>He's the Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart of retail.</i>

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>He's the Da Vinci
of dealmaking.</i>

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,827
<i>And he's the Monet of money.</i>

11
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,628
<i>Sir Richard McCreadie!</i>

12
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,636
<i>Thank you very much, Caroline.</i>

13
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,474
<i>In that wonderful Monda dress,
you look knockout.</i>

14
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,745
<i>When I was at school, my, uh,
schoolteacher used to read us</i>

15
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:11,313
<i>a fairy tale
at the end of the day.</i>

16
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,849
<i>And my favorite fairy tale was</i>

17
00:01:12,982 --> 00:01:14,851
<i>"The Goose That Laid
the Golden Egg."</i>

18
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,618
<i>That's what Monda is to me.</i>

19
00:01:16,753 --> 00:01:18,620
<i>Monda is the golden goose,</i>

20
00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:21,423
<i>and I love the eggs
that it lays.</i>

21
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:24,392
<i>Tonight, we're gonna reward
the shining stars. First up,</i>

22
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:26,696
<i>Distribution Team Leader
of the Year,</i>

23
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,363
<i>and that is Amanda Conrad.</i>

24
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,034
<i>Here's 10,000 pounds
for you to distribute.</i>

25
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,773
<i>Lifetime Achievement Award</i>

26
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:38,440
<i>goes to Philip Walker.</i>

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,212
<i>I think I should've got
this one, to be honest.</i>

28
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,215
<i>I'm sure you put a few hours
in yourself. Congratulations.</i>

29
00:01:46,348 --> 00:01:47,784
<i>Next is Buyer of the Year,</i>

30
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:50,452
<i>for driving the hardest
bargains in the business.</i>

31
00:01:50,585 --> 00:01:52,221
<i>Glad I don't have
to deal with him.</i>

32
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,223
<i>Good friend of mine,
Michael Harris.</i>

33
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,561
<i>Well done. Well done.
Here you go.</i>

34
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:03,065
<i>This year, I'm delighted
to announce</i>

35
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:06,235
<i>that Monda have paid out
the biggest dividend</i>

36
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,871
<i>that any private company
has ever paid.</i>

37
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:13,676
<i>One-point-two billion pounds
to be paid to our owner</i>

38
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,312
<i>and my very own
billion-dollar babe, Samantha.</i>

39
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,218
<i>Um, wow, that is
a really big check.</i>

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,220
<i>I don't know what to do
with all those zeros.</i>

41
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,388
<i>But, um, I feel like
we've earned it,</i>

42
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,859
<i>so thank you so much to Rich,
and thank you to everybody.</i>

43
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:32,327
<i>You guys, you know,
you've all worked so hard,</i>

44
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,797
<i>and this is for all of you.</i>

45
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:39,302
<i>I mean... No, not literally,
but I mean, thank you.</i>

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,427
Thank you.

47
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:08,831
What a mess.

48
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:12,268
Why did he need to build
an amphitheater?

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,104
It was a crazy idea.
Too ambitious.

50
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:18,373
"My name is Ozymandias,
king of kings:

51
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:22,477
Look on my works,
ye Mighty, and despair!"

52
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:26,015
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

53
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:33,155
On Friday night
for the welcoming drinks,

54
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:35,590
we are at the Jackie O' Bar.
Nice and informal.

55
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:38,393
That's where Pixie Lott and
Fatboy Slim will be playing.

56
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:40,428
- Oh, great. Yeah.
- Yeah. Um, on Saturday,

57
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,164
we're going
to bring the grand piano

58
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:44,399
to the Oasis Pool for Elton.

59
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,837
Then Sunday daytime
we're going to go to the arena

60
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,305
for the gladiator games,

61
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,940
- as you requested.
- Yay!

62
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:54,377
And Sunday night,
down by the beach, Coldplay.

63
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,686
What's he saying?

64
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:06,923
Why are you shrugging?
What's he saying?

65
00:04:07,056 --> 00:04:08,590
- Don't know.
- You don't know? Why?

66
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:10,927
He's Bulgarian. I'm Greek.

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,560
- You don't understand it?
- No.

68
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:15,630
Fucking hell, Giannis, man!

69
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:18,034
There is more than one type
of foreign language.

70
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:21,370
I know that. I'm not an idiot.
Why are you hiring Bulgarians?

71
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,739
They're cheap. That's why.

72
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:25,975
It's slow, Giannis.
The whole lot.

73
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,910
They never made
an amphitheater before.

74
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:30,913
Yeah, I've never made an
amphitheater before, obviously.

75
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,349
This our main beach.

76
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,582
Yeah.

77
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,120
Nice.

78
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:40,923
Who are they?

79
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:42,358
They... They are camping.

80
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,492
What is it, Duke of Edinburgh?

81
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,964
- Syrian refugees.
- Poor things.

82
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:50,565
They've come a long way.
They won't mind going further.

83
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,567
- Rich.
- What?

84
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:53,668
They're refugees.

85
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:55,805
They can find refuge somewhere

86
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:58,908
that isn't smack bang in
the middle of our fucking view.

87
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,609
In Greece, all beaches
are public.

88
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,511
It's not me. It's my guests.

89
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:05,748
Some of them are
very superficial.

90
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:12,088
It's just, all I can see
is plywood, mate.

91
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,924
I'm really anxious.
This is... It's not finished.

92
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:17,393
Don't worry.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

93
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:20,096
Yeah, but this is... This is
a tiny little bit of Rome,

94
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,731
and you've had 10 days.

95
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,266
We could make a virtue of it
being half built.

96
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:26,035
The ruins
of an ancient amphitheater.

97
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,703
No. No ruins.

98
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:29,571
No ruins. Melanie, tell him why.

99
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,274
One photo,
and it's an easy tabloid headline.

100
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:35,444
The end of an empire.
Fiddling while Rome burns.

101
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:37,645
- Handing it to them on a plate.
- I know.

102
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,415
They're already
like flies on shit.

103
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,784
Sorry. I am joking.
It will be finished.

104
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,953
Actually, Rich, from this angle,
it looks very...

105
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,921
- It's very imperial.
- Ohh...

106
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:50,126
Those who are about to die
salute you.

107
00:05:53,628 --> 00:05:55,563
Go on, then. Die.

108
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,769
I'm dying.

109
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:03,973
Nah, you can die better than
that. Die again, but better.

110
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:11,313
I'm dying.

111
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,093
What's wrong with him?
Looks like a rescue cat

112
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,828
that needs to be put down.

113
00:06:25,961 --> 00:06:28,097
I warned you,
they don't like being moved.

114
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,932
It takes time
for them to settle.

115
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:32,634
We've not brought him
to go on a yoga retreat.

116
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,104
- He's supposed to be scary.
- When did you get here?

117
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,173
Last week.
All this banging and clattering

118
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:39,308
isn't helping, all right?

119
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:41,143
What is this?

120
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:43,946
- It's...
- It's like some sort of prison.

121
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,049
We need something to pep him
up a bit. Some cocaine.

122
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:50,352
The kitchen staff have some.
I was told.

123
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:52,154
What he needs is a sedative,
if anything.

124
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:54,824
- Mum!
- Oh, Nanny's here now.

125
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:58,660
- She's still alive.
- Come here. Come here.

126
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,564
- Ah, Ricky.
- Ah! All right, Finn.

127
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:04,834
- Hi, Dad. Yeah, go on.
- Where's your big brother?

128
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,502
Adrian's busy working.

129
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,071
- He works too hard.
- He'll be here on the night.

130
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,940
- He's a grafter, like his dad.
- Yeah.

131
00:07:11,073 --> 00:07:13,608
- Why have you got the lion?
- It's for the gladiator games.

132
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:15,744
We're recreating <i>Gladiator,</i>
like we used to.

133
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:17,813
It was tigers, not lions,
in <i>Gladiator.</i>

134
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,849
That film was littered
with inaccuracies.

135
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,584
Don't get me started
on <i>Gladiator.</i>

136
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:23,552
We want it to be authentic.

137
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:26,654
- What's his name?
- Clarence.

138
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,157
Hiya.

139
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,928
Schoolboy error.

140
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,730
Never ever show fear to a lion.

141
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:36,532
Lions can smell fear.

142
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,568
I'm like that. I can smell fear.

143
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:43,172
What you doing lurking around
like a tabloid hack?

144
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:46,075
Uh, I'm Nick, the writer.

145
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,177
- Your biographer.
- Yeah, I know <i>who</i> you are.

146
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,546
I was asking
what the fuck you're doing.

147
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,416
Rich, don't frighten Nick.
He's on your side.

148
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,754
Thank you, Sir Richard,
for appearing before us today.

149
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,556
I wasn't aware I had a choice.

150
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,993
Retail fashion is
a huge global industry.

151
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,461
In the UK alone, it's worth

152
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,764
an estimated
60 billion pounds annually.

153
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:12,034
The owner of H&M is
the richest man in Sweden.

154
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,669
The owner of Zara is one of
the richest men in the world.

155
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:16,605
You are Britain's equivalent.

156
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:18,941
Famous for owning
several high-street brands,

157
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:22,111
including Monda
and of course M&J.

158
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:26,081
Last year, M&J went bankrupt
with the loss of 11,000 jobs.

159
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,851
- A lot of those were part-time.
- You've been described

160
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:31,854
as the unacceptable face
of capitalism. Is that fair?

161
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,789
Have you taken a look
in the mirror?

162
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:38,594
You've been described
as, uh, "Sir Greedy,"

163
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:41,597
uh, "Sir Shifty,"

164
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,165
"Greedy McCreadie."

165
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,101
Been calls for you to be
stripped of your knighthood.

166
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,070
Sir Richard,
what would you say to that?

167
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,639
Envy and jealousy,
my doctor tells me,

168
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:55,010
are incurable diseases.
I've done nothing wrong.

169
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:56,912
Yes, you have.

170
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:59,114
- Get off him, you bitch!
- Disgusting man.

171
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,617
Do you know what you've...?
Get off!

172
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,954
<i>I hate those shites that
try to embarrass my son in public.</i>

173
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,722
- Scum of the earth.
- Where is my job?

174
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:09,158
- Opportunistic bitch.
- Where are our jobs?

175
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,193
How old are you, Nick?

176
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,629
- I'm 44.
- Mm, you look...

177
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,131
- You look half that.
- Oh, thank you very much.

178
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:20,803
You have very pale skin.
Like a baby.

179
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,104
Um, ahem, so...

180
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:26,275
- So you are writing Ricky's book?
- That's right.

181
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:29,111
If you're gonna write something,
make sure it's good.

182
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,780
- Well, I'll try.
- No, you can't try.

183
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,082
You gotta be able to do it.

184
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,917
You either do it
or you can't do it.

185
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,785
Can you write the book, Nick?

186
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:38,454
Uh, yes. Yes, I can.

187
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:39,922
- Is that a "yes" I heard?
- Yes.

188
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:42,091
Yes, that's fine.

189
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:45,160
My son Ricky,
he pretends that he's...

190
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,029
He's... You know,
he's cocky and loud

191
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,131
and all of that stuff,
but he isn't really.

192
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:51,300
He's very sensitive,
very, very shy.

193
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:54,370
Very shy little boy, he was,
when he was at school, you know.

194
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,272
<i>Much more sensitive
than people think.</i>

195
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:58,742
<i>You know, he hides it
with all his bluster.</i>

196
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:01,711
Roll up for the amazing
Señor Ricardo, aka Tricky Dicky.

197
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:04,813
Have you got a coin, Lewis, that
I could borrow for this trick?

198
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:07,983
Thank you very much.
Oh, we have 50 English pence.

199
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:09,785
Big spender.
Now, watch carefully.

200
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:12,554
Well, as carefully as you can
with your rubbish eyes,

201
00:10:12,788 --> 00:10:14,724
as I make your coin...

202
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,058
disappear.

203
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,259
- Yeah!
- Watch again

204
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:18,861
as I weave another spell,

205
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,562
make it come back. You ready?

206
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:23,198
You're up, Greedy.

207
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,900
Ah, shit. Sorry, Lewis.

208
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:26,402
I guess
your coin's gone forever.

209
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:29,238
- Hey, that was my 50p.
- It's vanished into the ether.

210
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:32,975
There's a very fine line
between magic and tragic.

211
00:10:33,108 --> 00:10:36,746
Always makes me laugh how
everyone always thinks of him

212
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,316
as this sort of barrow boy, just
because he left school at 16,

213
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:43,152
but, heh, it was
a private school.

214
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:45,722
You know? And the two of us,
we hated it.

215
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,856
Run, McCreadie!

216
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,125
- Can't.
- No such word as "can't."

217
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,928
Yes, there is, sir.
It's what the others call you.

218
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:56,198
At least it sounds like "can't."

219
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,035
Out.

220
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:01,738
When you've changed,

221
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,539
you can go
to the headmaster's office.

222
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:11,213
Stop, sir. Stop, please.

223
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:14,983
Why, McCreadie?

224
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,086
You're tickling me, sir.

225
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:23,392
- Greedy!
- You can fuck off.

226
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,829
Things definitely got worse
when his dad died.

227
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:29,198
I mean, it was like school
was some prison for him.

228
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:30,265
<i>He was just...</i>

229
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:34,536
<i>...you know,
waiting to bust out.</i>

230
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:39,408
- We might have to sell the house.
- No. I can leave school.

231
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,378
Use the money you spend on the
fees to pay for the mortgage.

232
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:45,147
Your daddy wanted you
to have an education.

233
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,850
He believed in education.

234
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:51,053
He's not here now, is he?
He's in the car in front.

235
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,355
I want you to be a success.

236
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,924
I want you to go
to Oxford or Cambridge.

237
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:58,660
I want you to be able to do
whatever you want to do.

238
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,062
And I just wanna make money

239
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,030
so I can do
whatever I want to do.

240
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,468
<i>How did he get
the nickname "Greedy"?</i>

241
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,303
<i>Greedy McCreadie.</i>

242
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,873
<i>I mean, he chose the name.</i>

243
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:11,073
<i>It was his gambling name.</i>

244
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,941
- Ladies, Lewis.
- Piss off.

245
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:15,477
- Right, <i>faites vos jeux.</i>
- What does that mean?

246
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:18,113
It's French for
"place your fucking bets."

247
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:20,249
<i>Cards was his thing.
Even back then,</i>

248
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:23,352
<i>it was about gambling,
it was about making money.</i>

249
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:24,453
Who's gonna get it?

250
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:29,425
Okay, here we go.

251
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,994
Oh, has he gone bust?
Ah, yes, he has.

252
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,962
That's all mine.
Thank you very much.

253
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:36,699
- McCreadie. Gambling?
- Lewis, thank you.

254
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:38,500
How can it be gambling
when I always win?

255
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,035
It is more like robbery.

256
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:41,937
- Hand it over.
- Sir, what are you doing?

257
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,939
Sir, no, no, no, no!
Sir, I'm the banker!

258
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:45,875
- It is against school rules.
- It's my money.

259
00:12:46,008 --> 00:12:47,710
- No, this is mine.
- I'm confiscating it.

260
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,879
What are you gonna do with it?
Buy a toothbrush?

261
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:53,382
I'm gonna pay it to your mother
and watch her dance.

262
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,922
I'm afraid at this school,
we expect the highest standards

263
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:00,924
of behavior and achievement.

264
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:03,927
Is that why you hit children?
Is that your high standard?

265
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,161
Corporal punishment
is a necessary evil...

266
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:10,165
You're an unnecessary evil, hm?

267
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:11,868
Ricky,
let's get out of here.

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,403
We don't need these people.
We don't need this school.

269
00:13:14,536 --> 00:13:17,306
I know your sort. You're
the sort that used to put up

270
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,976
"no Irish, no blacks,
no dogs" signs, hm?

271
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:23,746
I met plenty of people like you
when I came to London.

272
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,348
Now look at me.
Take a good look.

273
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:29,017
I've got much more money
than most of them have

274
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:32,689
and a bloody sight
more than you.

275
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:37,961
<i>Bye.</i>

276
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,529
Goodbye, Mrs. McCreadie.

277
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:43,432
The mother is worse
than the son.

278
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:46,401
Bloody stuck-up English gits.

279
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,271
- We're gonna show them.
- We are gonna be fine, Ricky.

280
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:51,039
We'll be more than fine.

281
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:53,041
Fuck them.

282
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,944
Fuck all of them.

283
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:02,551
- One more time. One more time.
- Oh, no, no.

284
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:04,253
- Got it.
- It's simple.

285
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,188
You know it's simple.
Follow the queen.

286
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:07,456
Mm-hm.

287
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:11,460
Watch... the... queen.

288
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,428
Follow her like a corgi
humping her leg.

289
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,398
- Right, Eric, where's the queen?
- Heh-heh. Hm...

290
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:18,233
That one?

291
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,536
Balls. Every time.
I don't know how you do it.

292
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:22,104
- Eric!
- Come on, give me a fiver.

293
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,505
I've gotta go see my supplier.

294
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,307
- Drug supplier?
- I don't need drugs.

295
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,276
I am fucking drugs.

296
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,411
What a prat.

297
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,213
<i>♪ That's what I want ♪</i>

298
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:32,381
<i>♪ That's what I want ♪</i>

299
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:35,083
<i>♪ That's what I want ♪</i>

300
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,553
- <i>♪ That's what I want ♪</i>
- <i>♪ That's... ♪</i>

301
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:42,491
So you're... You're one of
his oldest friends, his mentor.

302
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,095
He didn't need a mentor.

303
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,331
He was his own man
from the start.

304
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:51,533
He had an instinct, a talent.

305
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,037
What do you want
for this lot?

306
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,405
- Ten grand.
- We both know this is shit.

00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:59,241
I'll give you 4, and you'll
shake my hand and kiss my arse.

308
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:01,176
If it's shit,
then why do you want it?

309
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,312
- Four grand.
- There's 500 items there.

310
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,114
Yeah, 500 items of shit.
I'll give you 4 grand.

311
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:09,052
- You just gonna keep saying 4?
- I can say 3 if you like. Three.

312
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:12,487
- I can't do 4.
- Right. I've heard enough.

313
00:15:17,526 --> 00:15:18,828
Okay, 4.

- How are you?
- Hello, mate. You all right?

317
00:15:30,707 --> 00:15:31,708
- And the back pain?
- Yeah.

318
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,275
- Yeah, spasm?
- Yeah.

319
00:15:33,408 --> 00:15:35,678
When these are done,
can you send them there?

320
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:38,280
That's it, pull up.
Go there and we'll back you in.

00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:39,716
Hey!

322
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:43,585
Just wait a second.
Mate, what are you doing?

323
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,387
- Nothing.
- Well, I don't care. Move!

324
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,656
Back, back, back.
Keep moving, keep moving.

325
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,695
- Move! I've got a shop, wanker!
- It'd make more sense.

Welcome to Impresse, where we

Don't discount us
because it's discount.

328
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,069
Do not judge it
because it's budget.

329
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:03,338
Sir, why did the chicken
cross the road?

330
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:05,240
Because we're selling
the same clothes

331
00:16:05,374 --> 00:16:06,743
at a fraction of the price.

332

Oh, is it a bit quiet?

333
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:15,417
Let me go inside. I'll see
if I've got any spare customers.

334
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,754
Let me just squeeze in. Unh!

When he got going,
Maggie Thatcher came to power,

336
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:24,060
Ronnie Reagan came to power.
The market was king. It was god.

337
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,897

a great market trader.

Too hard, some would say.

00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,669
Was it always obvious
that he was gonna be a success?

341
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:36,271
- Heh, it was to him.
- Huh.

Thirteen.

344
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:45,948
Can we get
a bottle of champagne?

345
00:16:46,181 --> 00:16:47,449
Of course, sir.

346
00:16:48,918 --> 00:16:50,086
Fifteen.

347
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:52,621
- Seventeen.
- Yes!

348
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,757
What's the average wage
in Leicester?

349
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:56,558
I don't know.
Three quid an hour.

350
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,627
Two eighty-eight.
What is the average wage

351
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:01,496
- in Sri Lanka? Go on.
- I have no idea. Uh...

352
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,433
- Quarter of that or something?
- Fifty p.

353
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,468
Well, I was not that far off,
was I?

354
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:08,203
- Plus transport costs...
- No, no, no.

355
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,472
Not 50p an hour, 50p a day.

356
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,374
Imagine that.
Imagine how many dresses

357
00:17:12,507 --> 00:17:14,309
I can get made for 50p a day.

360
00:17:23,218 --> 00:17:25,454
Good to meet you.
Sorry about the clammy hands.

361

- You are shitting me.

362
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,827
I could get this done cheaper in
London without leaving my home

363
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,495
and eating my three-star hotel's

- Nine dollars.
- Shake my hand on 5.

Nine is the best
we can offer.

368

You will not get
cheaper anywhere.

I don't know.

- Do I look like a mug?
- What?

379
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,169
Come on. Nod your head
and shake my hand at 8.

380
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,405
- Eight.
- There. Even at 8,

381
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,041

- Two hundred, sir.
- What?

387
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:47,203
I'm not paying 200
for a near-death experience.

388
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,570
- Two hundred.
- Okay, look.

00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,505
I like your bargaining.
I'll give you 30.

390

You can pay 200 rupees.

Thank you. I'm not gonna pay
200 rupees.

393
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:58,580
Okay, okay, how about 50?
I'll give you 50.

394
00:18:58,714 --> 00:19:00,382
And then we'll go inside,
and I'll...

come? You can pay now.

What, me or the boat?

419
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:14,522
Well, both,
but I meant the boat.

420
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,959
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you, darling.

- Oh, it's mine.
- Francois loves to sail.

424
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:25,533
Yeah, I like to feel the sea,
feel the waves.

425
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,170
Oh, yeah, when I wanna
feel the sea or feel the waves,

426
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:29,906
I just go for a swim
in the sea.

427

- How you doing?
- Nice shirt. Bit loud.

432
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:42,752
- Let's get a drink.
- Lead on. Don't film me!

433
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:45,620
Film them, but don't film me.

Sorry. May... Sorry.

- Right. Um...
- Please tell him his line.

444
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,052
- Do you know what the line is?
- Obviously not.

445
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:18,921
Okay. Uh, all right, so, um...

446
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:23,993
It's "Maybe I'm not the person
you thought I was." Yeah?

447

- Okay. I gotcha.

- Yeah, speeding.

00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:36,839
Okay. Excellent. Action!

452
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:39,008
I know I screwed up,

453

but maybe I'm not the person
I thought I am.

454

00:22:05,134 --> 00:22:07,569
I don't know.
I thought it's on the drawing.

461
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,438
It is not on the drawings!

462
00:22:09,571 --> 00:22:12,041
This is not on the drawings,
what I'm looking at here.

463
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:15,845
Arch, gap, arch is not
on the drawings.

464
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:18,114
He's gonna fucking crucify me!

465
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,582
Could be part
of the games, maybe.

466
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,954
Very funny, Giannis.

467
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,655
Fortunately, I don't think
you've got the wherewithal

468
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,026
to make a workable
fucking cross!

469
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:34,163
What's wrong, Lily?
Tell me all about it.

470
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,700
It's just Fabian.

471
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,803
We're going through
a bit of a...

472
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:45,741
A bit of a rough patch,
and he makes me sad.

473
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:49,311
I thought that was
just part of the show.

474
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,814
For the TV, for the filming.

475
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:54,016
You're really going out
with Fabian?

476
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,684
- Yes.
- Oh!

477
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:58,054
No.

478
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:01,457
Oh, I don't know. I mean...

479
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,591
I mean, it is scripted, but...

480
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:06,896
Why are you crying?

481
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:09,532
Well, it's method.

482
00:23:09,664 --> 00:23:13,803
We have to stay in character,
even off set.

483
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,905
But you're playing
yourself, Lily.

484
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:17,006
Think about it.

485
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,974
You are your character.

486
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,945
- I know. But...
- Yes. Mm-hm.

487
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,281
I have to find myself.

488
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:28,951
Which is harder than I thought.

489
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:32,354
Excuse me. Do you know the way
to the Poseidon Terrace?

490
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:34,857
Yeah, it's just...
Do you know what, I'll take you.

491
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,159
Oh, thanks.
You're from England?

492
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,728
- Yeah. Leicester.
- Leicester. Heh.

493
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:42,832
- Do you follow the football?
- Uh... No.

494
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,632
Me, neither. That's a relief.

495
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:47,369
Because that's pretty much
all the footie chat I've got.

496
00:23:47,602 --> 00:23:49,338
On the other hand,
if you want to ask me

497
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:51,507
about Richard III's body
being discovered

498
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,843
in a car park
in Leicester, fire away.

499
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,610
So he wants it to be epic.

500
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:57,113
- Great.
- Fucking epic, to be exact.

501
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:59,181
Fucking epic's my middle name.

502
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:01,616
<i>The Great Gatsby</i>
meets <i>Gladiator</i>

503
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,786
- meets <i>The Godfather.</i>
- Mm-hm.

504
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,554
And other films
beginning with G.

505
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:09,091
<i>Goodfellas, Gone with the Wind,</i>
um, <i>Grease.</i>

506
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,192
Oh, hi. You all right?

507
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:11,360
- Hi.
- Hi.

508
00:24:11,594 --> 00:24:12,728
Come join us. Have a seat.

509
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:14,530
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you met Amanda.

510
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,365
You should interview her
for your book.

511
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,800
Oh, really? Why is that?

512
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,969
She used to work for M&J
before it shut down.

513
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:22,605
- In one of the shops.
- Now she works for me.

514
00:24:22,738 --> 00:24:24,740
Ah, so you're
part of the family.

515
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:26,208
The McCreadie family.

516
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:28,077
- Not really.
- If it's a family,

517
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,378
it's a dysfunctional one.

518
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,413
How long
have you been part of it?

519
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:33,249
Since Samantha's
40th birthday party.

520
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:35,718
What kind of budget
you thinking for the party?

521
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,786
- Oh, whatever it takes.
- A million pounds.

522
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,555
What? It's my 40th, babes.

523
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,957
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

524
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:44,059
For the whole party
or just the music?

525
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,828
Well, what do we need?

526
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:48,831
- Well, it depends who you like.
- Mm-hm. What about Elton?

527
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:51,233
- John?
- Mm, there's only one Elton.

528
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:53,435
That's doable.
We've used Elton a few times.

529
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:54,737
- How much?
- How much?

530
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,238
- He's a million to sing.
- Pounds?

531
00:24:56,372 --> 00:24:58,107
- Dollars.
- Well, it's not bad.

532
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,142
His costs are on top
of that, obviously.

533
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:02,011
- How much are they?
- He needs a jet,

534
00:25:02,144 --> 00:25:04,013
his tour manager,
his sound crew.

535
00:25:04,146 --> 00:25:06,248
- Mariah Carey, when she came...
- Oh, my God!

536
00:25:06,382 --> 00:25:08,184
I love Mariah Carey. Oh!

537
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:10,219
- ...she brought all her dogs.
- She did?

538
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,421
- Mm.
- How many dogs?

539
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:14,823
- Quite a few.
- Hm.

540
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:16,859
Mm, and Diana Ross,
when she came,

541
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:19,228
she brought her whole family
for a 10-day holiday.

542
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:21,463
Well, give an inch,
take a fucking mile.

543
00:25:21,697 --> 00:25:23,766
Yeah. Crazy.

544
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,969
- What about Robbie Williams?
- He's a million.

545
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,871
Robbie Williams is
the same as Elton?

546
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:30,005
- Yeah.
- Got a fucking nerve.

547
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,676
What about Shakira?

548
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:36,212
What's...? What's her quote
looking like? Shakira.

549
00:25:36,345 --> 00:25:38,480
<i>Shakira? Around the same.</i>

550
00:25:38,714 --> 00:25:41,083
<i>Probably go up
to about 3 for a package.</i>

551
00:25:41,217 --> 00:25:43,118
- About 3 million for a package.
- What?

552
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,154
- Are you fucking... Three million?
- Shakira?

553
00:25:45,287 --> 00:25:47,089
She doesn't even wear shoes
when she sings.

554
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:49,825
Let's just, um, park Shakira
and Beyoncé for a moment.

555
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,193
Have you got anything around...

556
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:53,162
Imagine parking
Shakira and Beyoncé.

557
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:55,231
- ...the half a million mark?
- There's a thought.

558
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,266
- Hard to park Beyoncé.
- 500K?

559
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,001
How much is Tom Jones?

560
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:01,670
<i>Uh, He would be
around sort of 350.</i>

561
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:02,871
- Three-fifty.
- That's it?

562
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:04,673
- We can have Tom Jones!
- A bargain.

563
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:05,941
We'll have two Tom Jones.

564
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:10,714
And it's been
pretty full-time ever since.

565
00:26:10,846 --> 00:26:13,782
We've been working on this party
for over a year.

566
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,318
- What's that Greek word?
- Taramosalata.

567
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:19,021
- No, not any Greek word, moron.
- Hubris.

568
00:26:19,154 --> 00:26:20,222
- That's it.
- Yes, hubris.

569
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:22,524
Pride comes before a fall.

570
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:23,759
Aristotle said that.

571
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:24,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

572
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,128
I think it's Aesop, actually.

573
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:27,997
- Do you?
- I've got the drive

574
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,033
- with the happy birthdays.
- Oh, great. That's good.

575
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,068
Ever since he got
hauled over the coals

576
00:26:33,202 --> 00:26:36,672
at the Select Committee,
he's just been obsessed with it.

577
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,341
He wants it to repair his
reputational damage, you know.

578
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:41,910
He wants it to show everyone
he's still the boss.

579
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:45,814
Now, M&J isn't the first company
of yours to go bankrupt, is it?

580
00:26:45,948 --> 00:26:49,018
In 1977, you set up Harston.

581
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:53,922
It closed with debts of 235,000
pounds and assets of 436.

582
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:57,293
In 1981, you started JM Jeans.

583
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,328
It was wound up
for not paying bills.

584
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:01,830
So was Wincraft,
another of your companies.

585
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:05,301
In 1995, you bought a chain
of department stores.

586
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:07,536
Five years later,
that chain had disappeared

587
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,005
from the high street.
Then there were the jewelers

588
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:12,941
you bought off the bank when
you persuaded them to discount

589
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:15,077
6 million pounds of debt
down to 3 million.

590
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,578
They went into liquidation.

591
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,213
I'm an entrepreneur.

592
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,850
I take risks. Some you win,
some you don't.

593
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,789
Well, indeed.
In 1990, you launched Xcellent.

594
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:28,324
Um... Um, okay,
so I was thinking possibly...

595
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:32,127
I was thinking
a natural oak for the back.

596
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:34,830
If that's not
quite right, we've...

597
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:37,767
A sort of darker walnut we have.

598
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,806
That is the color of posh shit.

599
00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:44,873
- Okay. Um...
- What else you got?

600
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,342
Well, we've got lots here.

601
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:48,944
Uh, actually, a muted blue.

602
00:27:49,078 --> 00:27:51,280
Fuck muted. I don't want muted.

603
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:53,215
Did Marcel Marceau ever sell

604
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:55,417
a single pair
of black-and-white tights?

605
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:58,387
No. I don't want muted.
I want noise.

606
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,758
- I'm in the business of loud.
- Right.

607
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,292
What's that?

608
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:05,994
- That's fuchsia.
- Yeah, fuchsia.

609
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:07,930
Fuchsia's a bit in-your-face.
That's...

610
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,767
I want in-your-face.
I am in-your-fucking-face.

611
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,301
Fuchsia. You're brand manager.

612
00:28:12,434 --> 00:28:14,970
You're supposed to understand
about interior design.

613
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:17,841
You can't get more interior
than fuchsia.

614
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:21,845
I mean, it's the actual color
of a twat, isn't it?

615
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:23,847
I mean, that is
nature's interior design.

616
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:26,382
It... It draws you in.
It's biology. It's...

617
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:31,053
I mean, fuchsia's French
for "fuck me," isn't it?

618
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:34,289
You know, it's funny, um,
hearing people refer to him

619
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,025
as the king of the high street.
I mean...

620
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,027
look at all those early shops
he bought.

621
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:40,662
They were absolutely terrible.

622
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,265
Oh, Christ on a bike, Neil.

623
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,000
What am I gonna say about this?

624
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:47,871
I don't... Well, I was hoping
you'd like it,

625
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:50,906
but it doesn't sound like...

626
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,843
- Is something wrong?
- Something's wrong. Yeah.

627
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:57,312
Um, too many clothes?
Too few clothes, perhaps?

628
00:28:57,446 --> 00:28:59,248
Oh, shall I put you
out of your misery?

629
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:00,382
- Yeah?
- Please.

630
00:29:00,516 --> 00:29:02,050
No, I'm not gonna do that.

631
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:04,420
That'd involve me performing
a very late abortion.

632
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,355
- Heh.
- Don't laugh. This is not banter.

633
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:09,258
This is me bollocking you.
Can you not read people?

634
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:11,393
No. Uh, yes, I can.

635
00:29:11,527 --> 00:29:13,429
You can't. Otherwise,
you'd stop talking.

636
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:15,865
What else can't you read, Neil?

637
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:20,035
You can't read the fucking name
of the fucking shop.

638
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:23,105
It's white on white. In other
words, it's shite on shite.

639
00:29:23,238 --> 00:29:25,674
That is Page 1 of the manual,
isn't it?

640
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:28,143
In fact, it's the front cover
of the fucking book.

641
00:29:28,277 --> 00:29:30,245
Name recognition.

642
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,347
Yep.

643
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,016
If you don't sort this out,

644
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,151
the writing
is on the wall for you.

645
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:39,321
Except it won't be white on
white. It'll be red on brown.

646
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:41,957
You know what those colors
are for, Neil?

647
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,994
Uh, is it blood and poo?

648
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,530
Yeah, correct. Well done.
There's hope for you yet, Neil.

649
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:51,701
This is positive reinforcement.
This is me motivating you.

650
00:29:51,935 --> 00:29:53,569
I want this window
to scream "Xcellent."

651
00:29:53,703 --> 00:29:56,305
If it doesn't scream "Xcellent,"
I'm gonna scream at you,

652
00:29:56,438 --> 00:29:58,240
except it won't be "Xcellent,"
will it?

653
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:00,944
- No.
- No, it'll be the word "cunt."

654
00:30:01,076 --> 00:30:02,578
I'll be screaming it
so fucking loud

655
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:06,081
that it will melt that misshapen
slab of Spam you call a face,

656
00:30:06,215 --> 00:30:09,051
and then I'll put you in there
and use you as a mannequin.

657
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:11,320
At least then you'll be
some fucking use to me.

658
00:30:11,453 --> 00:30:13,021
- Yeah.
- And remember,

659
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,924
mannequins don't have cocks,
do they?

660
00:30:15,057 --> 00:30:16,124
No, they don't.

661
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:18,895
- What do they have instead?
- I suppose

662
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:22,264
- sort of smooth bumps, really.
- Smooth bumps. Right.

663
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:25,033
So if you don't wanna swap
your cock for a smooth bump,

664
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,602
what are you gonna do?

665
00:30:28,337 --> 00:30:29,238
Sort this out?

666
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:30,439
- Yeah, sort this out.
- Yeah.

667
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:32,207
All right. Cheers.

668
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:36,946
Xcellent went bankrupt
with 13 million pounds of debt.

669
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,081
You've got
burnt orange next to red.

670
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,951
I mean, that's just...
It clashes.

671
00:30:44,988 --> 00:30:48,023
Whose fucking idea
was fucking fuchsia?

672
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,094
Don't know
what you're fucking laughing at.

673
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,196
Giving me a fucking migraine.

674
00:30:54,329 --> 00:30:56,231
Oh, Christ, it...

675
00:30:56,365 --> 00:30:59,936
It's like being trapped
inside a-a-a giant vagina

676
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,204
full of discount clothes.

677
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:05,574
Thought these
would have sold well.

678
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,476
I think I need them.

679
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:09,946
Oh, that's better.

680
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,381
- Where's Neil?
- He's off with his nerves.

681
00:31:12,514 --> 00:31:15,384
"Off with his nerves."
Off with his fucking head.

682
00:31:17,586 --> 00:31:20,322
I'm gonna tell you something,
but please don't freak out.

683
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:22,591
That'll have the opposite
effect, saying that.

684
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:24,626
- Then freak out, if you want.
- Spit it out.

685
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,528
Our A-listers are dropping
like flies.

686
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:27,997
- What?
- They're not coming.

687
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:29,832
That's the point,
to make us look good.

688
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:31,600
- I know, I know.
- What about Leo?

689
00:31:31,734 --> 00:31:33,101
He says he's got a shoot.

690
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:35,504
Some fucking PR pixie's
bent his ear.

691
00:31:35,637 --> 00:31:38,106
- Fucking bear-shagging twat.
- Hi.

692
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,608
- My friend, money.
- Sorry.

693
00:31:39,742 --> 00:31:41,811
- I haven't got any, all right?
- Money, money!

694
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:43,312
I'm wearing swimming shorts.

695
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:46,515
Where am I gonna hide money?
Up me arsehole?

696
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:49,351
Wait. Why don't we
tell them about the refugees

697
00:31:49,484 --> 00:31:52,421
and turn the Coldplay gig
into a benefit?

698
00:31:58,695 --> 00:32:00,462
What are you doing, Giannis?

699
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:03,632
Giannis?

700
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,268
- We're tying it down.
- Why?

701
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,370
It's getting very windy.

702
00:32:08,503 --> 00:32:11,007
Maybe could blows it away.

703
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:13,208
It's a windy island.
What we can do?

704
00:32:13,342 --> 00:32:14,610
Yep.

705
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:17,379
Mykonos is very famous
for the wind.

706
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:18,715
Yeah.

707
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,685
- This is your young man, huh?
- Yes, this is Francois.

708
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:24,519
Hello. I'm very happy
to meet you.

709
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:26,321
The pleasure's all mine,
Francoise.

710
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:29,092
No, it's Francois.
Otherwise, I would be a girl.

711
00:32:29,224 --> 00:32:30,258
- Ha-ha!
- Get it right, Mum.

712
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:31,861
Where are the children?

713
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,295
Finn sleeps all day.

714
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:35,297
He's pale.
He looks like a vampire.

715
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:38,166
Lily was here, but she's off
with the reality TV show.

716
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,235
Oh, what's that about?
Why would you want

717
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:42,471
your life splashed
all over the telly, Francoise?

718
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:44,439
- Beats me.
- It's good for her.

719
00:32:44,573 --> 00:32:46,642
It gives her something to do,
keeps her grounded.

720
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:48,276
- Keeps her grounded?
- Yeah. Yeah.

721
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,679
Look at the Kardashians.

722
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:52,214
Kylie Jenner's got
a billion Instagram followers.

723
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,549
- She's on the cover of <i>Forbes.</i>
- Well, she must be

724
00:32:54,684 --> 00:32:56,284
a very good person,
very successful...

725
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,186
She's richer than you, sweetie.

726
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,422
- She's worth a lot. Yes.
- That's not true, is it?

727
00:33:00,555 --> 00:33:01,758
- It's true.
- Can't be true.

728
00:33:01,891 --> 00:33:03,592
She's richer than you.

729
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:06,129
Is that a push-up bra,
or are they new?

730
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:09,699
Are those teeth fake? Put them
in the glass. Take them out.

731
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:12,501
- Yeah, they cost 20 grand.
- Well, these cost 10K.

732
00:33:12,634 --> 00:33:15,071
Where'd you get those from?
Discount Tits R Us?

733
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:17,106
You haven't seen them.
They're amazing.

734
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:19,709
I have fantastic tits.
Tell him I have fantastic tits.

735
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:25,347
Chicken for you.

736
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,716
- Hi!
- And chicken...

737
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:30,252
- Chicken for you.
- How about some chicken?

738
00:33:30,385 --> 00:33:33,122
What about biscuits?
Do we have any biscuits?

739
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:34,724
There you go.

740
00:33:36,258 --> 00:33:37,694
They seem delighted. I would be.

741
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:40,963
Okay, great. And cut.
Uh, okay, we're gonna reset.

742
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,766
We'll come in for a close-up.
If you could get the food back.

743
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,234
So just remember
who you gave it to.

744
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:47,569
Just need to take this back.

745
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:49,806
Hey, sorry.

746
00:33:49,939 --> 00:33:51,573
- Hey, you're getting them...
- Aah!

747
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,509
- Chill! I'm gonna give it...
- What are you doing? Hey!

748
00:33:54,643 --> 00:33:56,611
Look, you're gonna get it back!

749
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:58,715
What are you doing?
We don't need this food then.

750
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:01,349
- You're gonna get it back.
- Wild misunderstanding.

751
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:02,517
We're just resetting.

752
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:04,187
There's a lot of them,
isn't it?

753
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,688
Shit, are they filming this?

754
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:08,223
This time, when we give you
the food,

755
00:34:08,356 --> 00:34:10,193
if you could just be happy.
Smiling.

756
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,294
- Happy.
- Is that okay?

757
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,229
- Let's do it. Not really okay.
- Great.

758
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:16,799
Okay, great.
When you're ready, head on in.

759
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:18,134
Hi.

760
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,770
Would you like some chicken?

761
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:23,139
- Yummy. Delicious.
- Yeah.

762
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:25,775
Not laughing. It's not funny.

763
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:27,242
It's... It's happy.

764
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,411
- Excuse me.
- That's good, huh?

765
00:34:29,544 --> 00:34:30,980
- That's a bit much.
- Oi!

766
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,448
Maybe smile a bit less
than that. Just a bit less.

767
00:34:33,582 --> 00:34:35,484
That's lovely. Perfect, see?

768
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,422
I'm afraid we have
to ask you to go.

769
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:42,859
No, we are not going
to leave. It's public beach.

770
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:46,461
Yeah, it's a public beach,
but to visit, not to stay.

771
00:34:46,595 --> 00:34:49,699
There are hungry children here
that we're trying to feed.

772
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:51,633
Look at me.
We have right to stay here.

773
00:34:51,768 --> 00:34:53,169
- You don't.
- Your father asked us...

774
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,437
- A baby is crying.
- I've got instructions.

775
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,808
There are children here! Poor
children we're trying to feed!

776
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,744
Don't touch it. Don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

777
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:03,780
Look, we're allowed
to film here!

778
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:05,248
Look, there's a baby!

779
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,382
Hey, let's chill out,
chill out.

780
00:35:07,516 --> 00:35:09,484
And he's crying!

781
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,655
Yeah, just... Thanks.
Let's do this nicely.

782
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,357
Let's everyone go.

783
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,059
We don't want trouble.

784
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,662
- Aw...
- Have you ever seen

785
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:22,265
a baby cry like that?

786
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:24,566
I know. You're very charitable.

787
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,469
Let us go. Let us go.

788
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:30,907
It's all right. It's okay.

789
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,642
- Fantastic. Got all of that.
- I'm gonna have a panic attack.

790
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:35,678
You can't have tents here.

791
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:37,847
- You have to move.
- I was trying to help!

792
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,549
I know. I saw.

793
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,887
Sorry. There's so much stuff.

794
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:47,223
I should probably have
kept a log,

795
00:35:47,355 --> 00:35:48,557
but you know what it's like.

796
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:50,525
Would have been a good idea,

797
00:35:50,659 --> 00:35:52,795
or if you had labeled
any of the footage.

798
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:54,263
The chaos of war.

799
00:35:55,731 --> 00:35:57,300
Not really a war, was it?

800
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,902
I think maybe, when I thought
I was turning it off,

801
00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:02,404
- I was turning it on.
- No, definitely. Yeah.

802
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,842
Oh, there's one.

803
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:08,077
<i>Say "Happy
birthday, Sir Richard."</i>

804
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,113
<i>Happy birthday, Sir Richard!</i>

805
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:12,882
Hiya.

806
00:36:13,015 --> 00:36:15,117
Oh, hi. Thanks.

807
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,253
How's it going?

808
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,689
- Fine.
- Hi.

809
00:36:24,626 --> 00:36:27,562
This is the next factory.

810
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:30,967
I know that place.

811
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,336
- It's in Sri Lanka.
- Yeah. How do you know?

812
00:36:33,468 --> 00:36:34,871
My Aunt Amali works there.

813
00:36:35,004 --> 00:36:37,539
- Thought you were from Leicester.
- My uncle adopted me

814
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,909
- when I was 7.
- So your uncle's in Leicester

815
00:36:40,042 --> 00:36:42,644
- and your aunt's in Sri Lanka?
- Different uncle.

816
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:44,113
- She still works there?
- Yeah.

817
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:46,983
Well, she might be
in this footage. Hold on.

818
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,550
How much is there?

819
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:49,986
All the footage in the world.

820
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,587
You know,
I was hired as a writer.

821
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:54,623
When I write,
there's ink in the pen.

822
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:57,793
Yes, that's definitely one.

823
00:36:57,927 --> 00:36:59,328
<i>Right, I'm rolling.</i>

824
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,830
<i>"Happy birthday, Sir Richard."</i>

825
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:02,999
<i>Happy birthday, Sir Richard.</i>

826
00:37:03,132 --> 00:37:05,368
No, no. No, she's not there.

827
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,337
- There's a bit more.
- Is that...?

828
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,605
I think I might have gone
to the loo.

829
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,141
- I'll just...
- Skip forward a bit.

830
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,408
That's not nice.

831
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:23,686
Where are all the others,
Giannis?

832
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:25,922
- They don't come.
- Why?

833
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:29,658
They heard about the double
money, so they won't come.

834
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,560
What do you mean? That should
make them want to come.

835
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:35,831
They are Bulgarians. Only Greeks
getting double money.

836
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,401
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Giannis, man!

837
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:39,902
Tell them they'll get the money!

838
00:37:40,036 --> 00:37:42,437
Get them down here!
We'll give them double money!

839
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,707
- Go and get them, Giannis!
- They won't come!

840
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,942
Why?

841
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:47,609
They already have
different jobs.

842
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:49,511
Oh, for fuck's sake!

843
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:53,049
Fucking donkey fuck, Giannis!

844
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:54,917
Fucking arsehole!

845
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:56,052
Bell end!

846
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:57,485
Prick, Giannis!

847
00:37:57,619 --> 00:37:59,355
Prick!

848
00:37:59,487 --> 00:38:02,792
- Have we come at a bad time?
- Yes, it's a bad time!

849
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:05,527
It's always a bad fucking time!

850
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,863
It's very much bad o'clock!

851
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:10,032
Fucking Giannis!

852
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:13,002
Fucking twerp!

853
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:16,571
You know this word,
Giannis? Twerp!

854
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:19,541
You wrote the fucking book
on it! Bell end!

855
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:24,714
I look like I've had a fight
with a pair of curtains.

856
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,382
Pull yourself together.

857
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,251
Oh, very good.
Very good for you.

858
00:38:29,484 --> 00:38:31,687
So we're gonna set
the fireworks off from there,

859
00:38:31,821 --> 00:38:33,956
halfway between the beach
and the amphitheater.

860
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:35,057
- Okay.
- Okay.

861
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:36,658
So the light from the rockets

862
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,961
- is gonna flood the amphitheater.
- Quick question.

863
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:40,730
Are you fucking
out of your mind?

864
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:42,698
Clarence is a wild animal.

865
00:38:42,832 --> 00:38:44,467
Can't be flooding his cage.

866
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:47,003
I'm not flooding his cage.
I'm flooding it with light.

867
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:49,038
Uh, cover...
You could cover his cage.

868
00:38:49,171 --> 00:38:52,674
- They do that with parrots.
- But he's not a parrot, mate.

869
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:55,845
He's a more intelligent,
sensual being than a parrot.

870
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:58,613
What is it?

871
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:02,785
You look very thin.
Making me look fat.

872
00:39:02,918 --> 00:39:04,954
I am. Thin Finn. Sounds good.

873
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:06,088
And you look pale.

874
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:09,425
Yes. I'm pale. And loitering.

875
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,558
Are you on crack?

876
00:39:11,794 --> 00:39:13,929
I'm not on crack, Mum. Jesus.

877
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:15,931
- Ecstasy?
- No.

878
00:39:16,065 --> 00:39:17,500
What about prescription pills?

879
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:20,903
- Jeez, Mum, I'm not...
- Cocaine?

880
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:24,040
MDMA? Or "Molly,"
as the young people call it.

881
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:26,809
Mum, I'm not on drugs, okay?

882
00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:29,445
I haven't seen you
this depressed ever, Finn.

883
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:32,048
And you're growing pubic hair
on your face.

884
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:33,449
It's not pu...

885
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,819
It looks wispy,
and it doesn't suit you.

886
00:39:36,952 --> 00:39:39,288
Frankly, you should shave it off
before the party.

887
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:40,990
It's an embarrassment.

888
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:46,162
- Hi.
- This is Nick.

889
00:39:46,295 --> 00:39:47,863
He's chronicling my life.

890
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:49,664
Chronicling? That's a bit grand.

891
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:52,535
Yeah, like <i>The Chronicles
of Narnia.</i> We...

892
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:56,072
We could call it <i>The Lion,
the Witch and the Wardrobe.</i>

893
00:39:56,205 --> 00:39:59,108
Not that you're a witch,
obviously.

894
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:03,045
We met, actually, in Monaco.
Don't know if you remember.

895
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,313
- Hi.

00:40:15,858 --> 00:40:17,526
Hi. Um...

901
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,495
I'm here to see
Samantha McCreadie.

902
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:22,765
- Yes, of course. Come aboard.
- Oh, thank you.

903
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:26,535
This is
a really spectacular yacht.

904
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:28,137
Thank you.
This is actually my baby.

905
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:30,672
I designed everything
on her by myself.

906
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,975
- Wow, that's lovely.
- Yeah, the fabrics, the wood.

907
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:36,779
Everything. The basketball court
upstairs. It's all my taste.

908
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,014
So just let's, um,
start off with,

909
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:40,716
when did you meet Sir Richard?

910
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,219
When I first met Rich,
he was a bottom-feeder.

911
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:44,553
I met him in a casino.

912
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:46,789
All right. My lucky number's 13.

913
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,124
Maybe it'll bring me luck.

914
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:49,525
No more bets.

915
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,361
- Number 13.
- Oh!

916
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:54,830
<i>♪ Sincerity ♪</i>

917
00:40:54,964 --> 00:40:56,932

918
00:40:57,066 --> 00:40:59,001
- What are you doing?
- I wanna see you again.

919
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:01,137
I'm playing hard to get.

920
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:07,176
Can I see you tomorrow?

921
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,613
Well, was that a yes or a no?

922
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,382
It's a yes!

923
00:41:13,616 --> 00:41:15,084
He'd worked in fashion
all his life,

924
00:41:15,217 --> 00:41:16,852
but he didn't have
a feel for it.

925
00:41:16,986 --> 00:41:19,822
He wasn't somebody who loved
clothes. He just loves deals.

926
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:22,558
You lied to me, right?
You fucking lied to me.

927
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,393
You're like a dodgy priest.

928
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:26,829
Now you've been caught
balls deep in a choirboy.

929
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:29,664
- What are you talking about?
- You said these were quality.

930
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:31,800
They're not quality.

931
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:34,136
"Pride Jeans." Yeah,
if you're proud to wear them

932
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,439
and look like a tit. I'll give
you 1.2 million in cash

933
00:41:37,672 --> 00:41:39,041
if you wipe off the debt.

934
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:41,410
Is that a joke?

935
00:41:41,644 --> 00:41:44,780
I'll give you 20p in a pound
on the debt, but that's it.

936
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:47,850
When I leave with this case of
cash, the deal's off the table.

937
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:50,653
I'll tell you something,
no one's gonna give you diddly

938
00:41:50,786 --> 00:41:52,621
for that pile of blue shit.

939
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:57,459
Okay! Okay.

940
00:41:57,693 --> 00:41:59,094
Come back.

941
00:42:00,763 --> 00:42:02,231
- So he was a bottom-feeder then.
- Yes.

942
00:42:02,364 --> 00:42:03,732
But what changed?

943
00:42:03,866 --> 00:42:06,669
Well, I brought him here
to Monaco.

944
00:42:06,802 --> 00:42:09,038
- Can you guess which boat?
- Is it the biggest one?

945
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:11,774
<i>Everybody's a billionaire here.
We were just small fry.</i>

946
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:13,677
- Is that our boat? That one?
- No.

947
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:16,979
- <i>We were just millionaires.</i>
- That's right. Well done.

948
00:42:17,112 --> 00:42:18,280
Hey, no!

949
00:42:18,414 --> 00:42:22,184
What we do in life
echoes in eternity.

950
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:24,820
I taught him that,
from <i>Gladiator.</i>

951
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:26,488
Hey, watch his eyes.

952
00:42:28,224 --> 00:42:31,327
You shall watch
as I bathe in his blood.

953
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,663
- Rich.
- Well, I didn't teach him that.

954
00:42:34,797 --> 00:42:36,799
I'm not even sure
it's in the film.

955
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,134
That was so close to his eye!
Put your sword down!

956
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,237
- Aah!
- Both of you, now, put them down!

957
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,972
Money makes money.

958
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,241
And when people think
you have money,

959
00:42:45,374 --> 00:42:46,875
then they give you more.

960
00:42:47,009 --> 00:42:48,712
They have no idea
of the bottom line.

961
00:42:48,844 --> 00:42:49,979
Why don't you buy
the whole group?

962
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:51,247
That's what I said.

963
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,849
- Not a problem, is it, Bob?
- We're a bank.

964
00:42:53,983 --> 00:42:55,685
We lend money.
That's what we do.

965
00:42:55,818 --> 00:42:58,654
So then we bought M&J
for 200 million.

966
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,123
Is this Blackpool Illuminations?

967
00:43:01,257 --> 00:43:02,891
What is the wattage
of these bulbs?

968
00:43:03,025 --> 00:43:05,361
- Hundred.
- Well, swap them out for 60s.

969
00:43:05,494 --> 00:43:08,998
You can't put 60-watt bulbs
up there. It's too gloomy.

970
00:43:09,131 --> 00:43:13,068
You know what I say? I don't do
"can't do." I only do "can do."

971
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:18,073
Thanks so much for making
the time to see me.

972
00:43:18,207 --> 00:43:20,509
Oh, any chance
to slag off Sir Greedy.

973
00:43:20,744 --> 00:43:23,713
- Oh, you weren't a fan, then?
- Oh, he was a bully.

974
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:27,684
That is the biggest pile of crap
I've ever seen. Get rid of it.

975
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,687
We can't get rid of it.
We've ordered it. It's ours.

976
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,988
You... How much
have you paid for this?

977
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:34,923
The whole range
across all the stores...

978
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:36,325
- Five million.
- Five million...?

979
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,394
Are you fucking kidding?
Tell me he's joking.

980
00:43:38,527 --> 00:43:40,296
- No.
- That is robbery.

981
00:43:40,429 --> 00:43:41,964
I should call the police.

982
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:45,702
He wasn't a businessman.
He was a parasite. Tapeworm.

983
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:48,170
I'll give you 3 million for it.

984
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:51,974
Nod your head and shake my hand.

985
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:55,311
Come on, nod your head
and shake my hand.

986
00:43:58,113 --> 00:43:59,281
All right, Mark. Well done.

987
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:02,351
You got a good deal.
You, come with me.

988
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:08,324
That was a negotiation.

989
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:09,958
You are a buyer.

990
00:44:10,092 --> 00:44:12,261
You're supposed
to fucking negotiate.

991
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:15,431
You nearly cost me
2 million pounds there.

992
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:18,300
You need to take a long,
hard look in the mirror and say:

993
00:44:18,434 --> 00:44:21,537
"I am a cunt," because you are.

994
00:44:26,842 --> 00:44:28,243
Fuck you.

995
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:31,046
M&J got us onto
the <i>Sunday Times</i> Rich List.

996
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,148
They valued it at a billion.

997
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:35,752
<i>Suddenly, we're in
the big leagues.</i>

998
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,086
Is that the right one?

999
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,321
It's the one I chose.
I love it.

1000
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:44,126
Oh, it's so sparkly.
It's so beautiful.

1017
00:45:36,512 --> 00:45:37,847

1020

Let's, uh, take a look
in a little more detail

1021
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:49,158
at your takeover of M&J.

1022
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,028
Can you stop staring at me,
please? It's very off-putting.

1023
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:56,231
During your ownership of M&J,

1024
00:45:56,365 --> 00:45:58,902
your family took
more than 400 million pounds

1025
00:45:59,034 --> 00:46:00,669
out of the company.

1026
00:46:00,904 --> 00:46:02,971
- Is that right?
- We were the owners.

1027
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:05,674
- Wow!
- You got a conference room there.

1028
00:46:05,909 --> 00:46:07,142
You've got a screening room,

1029
00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:09,846
- a library for meetings.
- This is the gravy.

1030
00:46:09,978 --> 00:46:12,114
Whilst M&J went
from having assets

1031
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:13,949
of almost 300 million pounds

1032
00:46:14,082 --> 00:46:17,352
to debts of more
than 250 million pounds.

1033
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:19,955
In other words, the company lost
550 million pounds

1034
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:22,692
whilst your family gained
400 million pounds.

1035
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:24,560
And I got this for you.

1036
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:27,396
It's an ancient Egyptian lion.

1037
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:30,165
- How old is it?
- Well, it's new.

1038
00:46:30,299 --> 00:46:32,134
It's an exact copy
of the original.

1039
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:34,203
Right, but it's a fake.

1040
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:35,939
- But this is real.
- Wha...?

1041
00:46:36,071 --> 00:46:38,741
- A giant prehistoric bird bone.
- Wow!

1042
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:40,877
Do you know what?
I don't normally go

1043
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:45,949
for large prehistoric birds,
but, uh, that is just genius.

1044
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:49,551
Sally.

1045
00:46:49,686 --> 00:46:51,286
This is Sally,
our fashion editor.

1046
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,988
You probably want to talk
to her.

1047
00:46:53,121 --> 00:46:54,490
This is Nick.
He's writing a book

1048
00:46:54,623 --> 00:46:56,091
- about Greedy McCreadie.
- Oh, hi.

1049
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:58,327
- Hi. You're the fashion editor?
- Yes.

1050
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,163
Why? Did you expect me to look
a bit more like a model?

1051
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,933
No, no. Of course not.

1052
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:05,601
Uh, not that you don't.

1053
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:08,905
You look gr... Very...
You look great.

1054
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:10,773
Uh, this is
our city desk over here

1055
00:47:11,006 --> 00:47:12,608
- if you want to follow me.
- Nice to meet you.

1056
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,343
- Yeah, and you. Yeah.
- Okay?

1057
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:16,545
It's just round here,
Jim is, okay?

1058
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:20,482
Um, so I was hoping you could
try and help me understand

1059
00:47:20,616 --> 00:47:22,251
the mechanics of the deals. I...

1060
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:25,587
I know nothing about business.
I mean, I'm not an idiot,

1061
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:28,524
but, uh, it might be easiest
if you imagine I am one,

1062
00:47:28,657 --> 00:47:31,126
and then I can tell you
if I find that patronizing.

1063
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:35,130
I mean, I know
what a savings account is.

1064
00:47:35,264 --> 00:47:37,599
Well, that's not relevant
to this.

1065
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:39,368
No, I know. I'm... I'm...

1066
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:42,104
I'm just saying,
feel free to talk down to me.

1067
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:44,206
Most people don't have
a problem with that.

1068
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,276
That won't be necessary.
It's all pretty simple.

1069
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:50,078
McCreadie has a whole bunch
of interconnected companies,

1070
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:52,414
but let's take the example
of the biggest, Monda.

1071
00:47:52,548 --> 00:47:55,250
<i>The jewel in his crown. Monda
made him a household name.</i>

1072
00:47:55,384 --> 00:47:57,954
<i>When McCreadie bought Monda,
it was a public company</i>

1073
00:47:58,086 --> 00:48:00,790
<i>listed on the stock exchange.
Anyone can buy shares in it.</i>

1074
00:48:01,024 --> 00:48:02,992
<i>People are buying
and selling all the time.</i>

1075
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,060
<i>Add up the shares, you get
the value of the company.</i>

1076
00:48:05,193 --> 00:48:07,663
<i>In the case of Monda, that was
about 900 million pounds.</i>

1077
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:09,364
McCreadie was
one of the pioneers

1078
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:11,166
of taking
public companies private.

1079
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,268
<i>To do that, you have
to buy all the shares,</i>

1080
00:48:13,402 --> 00:48:14,570
<i>900 million pounds worth,</i>

1081
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:16,438
<i>but he didn't have
that much money.</i>

1082
00:48:16,572 --> 00:48:18,674
<i>Even if he did, he didn't
like to use his own money.</i>

1083
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:21,176
What do you do when you
don't have enough money?

1084
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,047
I usually call my parents,
and they tell me to piss off.

1085
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:28,584
But I imagine
he didn't call my parents.

1086
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:32,521
Uh, I think he probably
borrowed it. Did he borrow it?

1087
00:48:32,654 --> 00:48:36,091
So Greed invites a few friends
down to his yacht in Monaco,

1088
00:48:36,224 --> 00:48:39,227
<i>including Bob,
his banker from HBOS.</i>

1089
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:42,531
<i>McCreadie persuades Bob to lend
him 95 percent of the money.</i>

1090
00:48:42,664 --> 00:48:45,167
<i>Then he calls the CEO of Monda
and makes an offer.</i>

1091
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,369
What the fuck?
It's the middle of the night.

1092
00:48:47,502 --> 00:48:50,606
There's 25 million in it for you
if I buy Monda.

1093
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,443
♪ Money, money, money
Must be funny ♪

1094
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:56,411
♪ In a rich man's world ♪

1095
00:48:56,545 --> 00:48:59,247
Now, 75 million
shiny English pounds

1096
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:00,616
go straight into the pockets

1097
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,685
of the managers
on the board of Monda.

1098
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,553
<i>So surprise, surprise,
they recommend</i>

1099
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:06,188
<i>that people sell to McCreadie.</i>

1100
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,057
All those in favor, aye.

1101
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:09,391
Aye.

1102
00:49:09,524 --> 00:49:11,460
That's outrageous.
That's bribery.

1103
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:15,098
Well, no, no, it's not bribery
because bribery is illegal.

1104
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,433
It's certainly an incentive,
but it's totally legal.

1105
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:20,469
Christ. How much
of his own money

1106
00:49:20,602 --> 00:49:23,405
- did Rich put in?
- Ten million.

1107
00:49:23,538 --> 00:49:27,409
So, what,
then he owes 890 million?

1108
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,544
No, McCreadie doesn't
owe anything.

1109
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,215
Monda owes HBOS
the money used to buy Monda.

1110
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:38,520
So he used Monda's money
to buy Monda? Is that legal?

1111
00:49:38,654 --> 00:49:40,123
It's totally legal.

1112
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:42,190
McCreadie was one
of the pioneers of this,

1113
00:49:42,324 --> 00:49:43,558
but it happens all the time.

1114
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:46,461
<i>So now Monda has
a big old chunky debt,</i>

1115
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:48,630
<i>890 million pounds.</i>

1116
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:51,633
<i>But Monda owns a lot of shops
on a lot of high streets.</i>

1117
00:49:51,768 --> 00:49:54,137
<i>Owns them.
Property is valuable.</i>

1118
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:56,139
<i>The last 20 years,
it's trebled in value.</i>

1119
00:49:56,271 --> 00:49:58,573
<i>So McCreadie gets Monda
to sell the properties</i>

1120
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,342
<i>and then rent them instead.</i>

1121
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:01,678
<i>There's no short-term gains,</i>

1122
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:03,478
<i>but one shop alone
on Oxford Street</i>

1123
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:05,647
<i>netted 200 million pounds.</i>

1124
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:07,917
So the sale of property
pays off the debt

1125
00:50:08,151 --> 00:50:10,753
and increases the profits,
so he looks like a genius.

1126
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:14,556
When really Monda has just
sold off all its assets.

1127
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:19,394
And that's how he paid himself,
or his wife, 1.2 billion pounds

1128
00:50:19,528 --> 00:50:22,364
<i>as a dividend
two years after buying Monda.</i>

1129
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:24,599
So it was only really
800 million pounds,

1130
00:50:24,734 --> 00:50:26,736
but we rolled over
400 from the year before

1131
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:29,504
so that Rich could make it
the biggest dividend ever

1132
00:50:29,638 --> 00:50:31,406
because he loves
a headline like that.

1133
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,275
That's Rich.
It's all about image.

1134
00:50:33,408 --> 00:50:35,178
He used to do magic tricks
as a child.

1135
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:38,213
So the first principle of magic
is to distract your audience.

1136
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:39,682
Make them look
at your left hand

1137
00:50:39,816 --> 00:50:41,583
while your right hand
takes the watch.

1138
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:43,385
That's how McCreadie
works with his dividend.

1139
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:45,387
So he paid the 1.2 billion

1140
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,456
from the money he made
selling the shops?

1141
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:50,559
No. Monda borrowed
the 1.2 billion

1142
00:50:50,693 --> 00:50:53,328
<i>from Bob the Banker
to pay his family.</i>

1143
00:50:53,462 --> 00:50:56,631
That's outrageous. So Monda then
owes all that to the bank.

1144
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:59,769
It's the same with M&J,
with all Greed's business deals.

1145
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,971
<i>Because the dividends
are paid to Samantha,</i>

1146
00:51:02,205 --> 00:51:04,606
<i>and she is resident in Monaco
which has no income tax,</i>

1147
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:07,210
<i>McCreadie saves
300 million pounds in tax,</i>

1148
00:51:07,342 --> 00:51:08,778
<i>100 million of which she uses</i>

1149
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:10,412
<i>to buy
a nice little runaround.</i>

1150
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:12,514
<i>It is classic asset stripping</i>

1151
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:15,584
<i>and classic tax avoidance.</i>

1152
00:51:15,718 --> 00:51:17,687
It's all just
one gigantic dodge, isn't it?

1153
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,555
Is this an investigation
into my tax affairs?

1154
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,525
I pay what I have to and no more
because I'm not stupid.

1155
00:51:23,658 --> 00:51:26,294
If you wanna chase people
avoiding tax,

1156
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:28,164
why don't you go after
the big boys?

1157
00:51:28,296 --> 00:51:30,733
I mean, look at Apple,
look at Amazon, Starbucks.

1158
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:33,401
- Why are you chasing me?
- Right, it's not them we're...

1159
00:51:33,535 --> 00:51:35,504
I suggest you Google it,
Mr. Chairman.

1160
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:38,507
That's another company. How much
tax do you think Google pay?

1161
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,409
Not very much. If you don't
believe me, talk to Bono.

1162
00:51:41,543 --> 00:51:43,378
He's avoided hundreds
of millions in tax

1163
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:45,715
by claiming that U2
are based in Holland.

1164
00:51:45,848 --> 00:51:47,784
Doesn't stop him
going around the world

1165
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:51,187
in your nan's sunglasses
proclaiming, uh,

1166
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:53,321
about ending poverty
or whatever.

1167
00:51:53,455 --> 00:51:55,057
This is him in the <i>Daily Mail.</i>

1168
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:59,494
"'You'd be stupid not to try and
cut your tax bill, ' says Bono."

1169
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:01,230
Nobody that lives here pays tax.

1170
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:03,365
Nobody on any of these boats
is paying tax.

1171
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:05,600
That's just the rules.
I'm following the rules.

1172
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:07,302
There's nothing wrong with that.

1173
00:52:07,435 --> 00:52:09,872
<i>The super yacht, the models,</i>

1174

Wow, that was amazing.

1180
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:26,321
- So why did you divorce?
- Rich likes to win.

1181
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:28,825
And what do you get
when you win? You get a...

1182
00:52:28,958 --> 00:52:31,294
- A medal?
- A trophy.

1183
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:33,262
Naomi's that trophy for him.

1184
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:34,663
I mean, I'm not
a gynecologist,

- Do you miss Monaco?
- I miss the boat.

1187
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,378
I still think that is
the best thing we ever made,

1188
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:53,783
excluding Adrian and Lily,
but including Finn.

1189
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:57,720
Is there anything else you miss?

1190
00:52:59,822 --> 00:53:02,591
Just getting a water for Naomi.

1191
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:04,459
She can see you guys,
by the way.

1192

Thank you, Finn.

But I still love your soul.

1200
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:24,146
I swore that I'd never cry
for another man.

1201
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:27,683
Baby, baby, don't cry.

1202
00:53:30,585 --> 00:53:32,722
- Uh, yeah. Uh, Lily?
- Yeah?

1203
00:53:32,855 --> 00:53:34,857
Yeah, um, so it says
in the script

1204
00:53:34,991 --> 00:53:36,625
- that you're crying.
- Tears?

1205
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:38,393
Yeah, if we could
have some tears.

1206
00:53:38,526 --> 00:53:40,863
- Okay. Give me a minute.
- Yeah. Sure. No, okay.

1207
00:53:40,997 --> 00:53:43,465
Just take a minute. Give us
a shout when you're ready.

1208
00:53:43,598 --> 00:53:45,567
- Want me to poke you in the eye?
- Fuck off.

1209
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:47,837
All right, all right.
It's just an idea.

1210
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,605
See, I always think of Diana
when I need to cry.

1211
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,309
I reckon
she would have loved it here.

1212

This is the place where
Apollo and Artemis were born.

1213
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:58,180
No, that's all a myth.

1214
00:53:58,413 --> 00:54:00,349
This place was built on trade.

1215
00:54:00,482 --> 00:54:02,018
Built by men like me.

1216
00:54:02,151 --> 00:54:04,887
This was once
the biggest trading post

1217
00:54:05,021 --> 00:54:06,822
in the whole
of the Mediterranean.

1218
00:54:06,956 --> 00:54:08,925
Commercial center of the world.

1219
00:54:09,058 --> 00:54:11,761

00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:21,636
but the valiant never
taste of death but once."

1222
00:54:21,771 --> 00:54:23,839
Just reading
off your bloody phone, Rich.

1223
00:54:23,973 --> 00:54:26,943
Yeah. BrainyQuote.
I love BrainyQuote.

1224
00:54:27,076 --> 00:54:29,412
Don't worry, Dad.
You're gonna die soon enough.

1225
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:32,214
- Finn.
- Oh, come on. It's just banter.

1226
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:37,019
Don't say "banter" like some
Hooray Henry horse fondler.

1227
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:38,620
I'm only 60.

1228
00:54:38,754 --> 00:54:41,357
Rupert's still running
News Corp in his 80s.

1229
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:42,758
Maybe I'll skip a generation,

1230
00:54:42,892 --> 00:54:44,226
leave everything
to your children.

1231
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:45,962
If you find anyone
to have children with.

1232
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:47,930
- Oh, Ricky.
- "I knew a man who once said,

1233
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:49,398
'Death smiles at us all,

1234
00:54:49,531 --> 00:54:51,834
and all a man can do
is smile back.'"

1235
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:55,237
That's...
That's a bit weird.

1236
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,505
He's quoting <i>Gladiator.</i>

1237
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:58,640
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1238
00:54:58,774 --> 00:55:01,077
I swore that I would never cry

1239
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,412
- for another man.
- Hey.

1240
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:04,914
- Cut!
- Then don't cry.

1241
00:55:05,047 --> 00:55:06,581
- Fuck's sake.
- Are you kidding?

1242
00:55:06,716 --> 00:55:08,851
- Get out of my shot, Finn!
- Were you guys acting?

1243
00:55:08,985 --> 00:55:10,686
- Sorry.
- Move out of the fucking way!

1244
00:55:13,823 --> 00:55:16,092
- I think she's actually crying.
- Yeah, she is.

1245
00:55:16,225 --> 00:55:19,028
You want it? Okay, Lily,
just go for it. Just use that.

1246
00:55:19,161 --> 00:55:21,697
- Yeah? Okay. Going.
- Yeah, fantastic. Go for it.

1247
00:55:21,831 --> 00:55:22,765
Open the gate.

1248
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:28,037
Clarence. Good boy.
Look at that.

1249
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,604
Come on. Look, look, look.

1250
00:55:30,973 --> 00:55:32,808
Good, Clarence. Good, good.

1251
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:35,444
Go, go, go, go.

1252
00:55:35,577 --> 00:55:36,746
Ha! Ha!

1253
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:38,546
Clarence, go.

1254
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:41,583
- Ha-da! Clarence!
- Ah! Ah!

1255
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:44,787
Is he always like this?

1256
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,554
Give him a minute.
He needs to warm up.

1257
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:48,791
He needs to find his motivation.
Come on. Ha-da!

1258
00:55:48,924 --> 00:55:51,293
We were just hoping
he'd have a bit more energy.

1259
00:55:51,526 --> 00:55:53,496
He will. He just...

1260
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:56,132
He's got a bit of stage fright.
A bit frozen.

1261
00:55:56,265 --> 00:55:58,666
Rich is expecting him
to be the star of the show.

1262
00:55:58,801 --> 00:55:59,667
Yeah.

1263
00:55:59,802 --> 00:56:01,971
He will be. He just, you know...

1264
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:05,041
He's not very good.

1265
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:06,909
Oi. Look, slower, slower.

1266
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:08,844
- But not so close to him, okay?
- Okay.

1267
00:56:08,978 --> 00:56:11,747
Show him the meat. You're not
trying to kill him. Come on.

1268
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:14,050
- Good boy. Come on!
- It's gonna be a disaster.

1269
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:19,522
Do you know any tricks
to make him a bit more scary?

1270
00:56:19,654 --> 00:56:22,925
- Well, these are the tricks.
- I'm not frightened at all.

1271
00:56:23,059 --> 00:56:24,760
I thought he'd be frightening.

1272
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:27,096
He will be. He will be.

1273
00:56:28,596 --> 00:56:30,299
Oh, fuck. They're back.

1274
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:31,666
Hello!

1275
00:56:31,801 --> 00:56:32,935
That's all we need.

1276
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:34,737
Hello!

1277
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:36,305
- Hi.
- Hello!

1278
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:40,342
The nomads are back
on the beach.

1279
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:42,845
We can't do anything
about it. It's a public beach.

1280
00:56:42,978 --> 00:56:44,980
I don't care.
I don't want them at my party.

1281
00:56:45,114 --> 00:56:48,583
We've got a bigger problem. The
<i>Daily Mail</i> got hold of this.

1282
00:56:48,717 --> 00:56:50,352
This is terrible
for our reputation.

1283
00:56:50,585 --> 00:56:51,987
What do you mean,
your reputation?

1284
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:54,690
No one knows who you are.
How bad is it?

1285
00:56:54,824 --> 00:56:57,326
I've had the agents
on the phone nonstop.

1286
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,063
Angelina's definitely not
coming. Rihanna's now a maybe.

1287
00:57:01,197 --> 00:57:04,166
- They're in breach of contract.
- Don't worry. I'll put a call in.

1288
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,203
No one reads <i>The Mail</i> online.
It's cleavage clickbait.

1289
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,805
Yeah, except
I'm the tit this time.

1290
00:57:15,711 --> 00:57:18,814
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

1291
00:57:20,648 --> 00:57:22,118
How long did it take?

1292
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:23,752
A day and a half.

1293
00:57:26,222 --> 00:57:29,291
- Just for this one arch?
- Yes.

1294
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:43,638
J. Lo's still good.

1295
00:57:43,772 --> 00:57:45,007
Ed Sheeran, probably a no.

1296
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:46,641
- And Harry's a no.
- Harry Styles?

1297
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:48,944
Mm-mm. Prince Harry.

1298
00:57:49,078 --> 00:57:52,014
- You could get doubles.
- That's not a bad idea.

1299
00:57:52,148 --> 00:57:55,117
Like kings on the battlefield
using decoys.

1300
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,886
- Did they?
- They did in Shakespeare.

1301
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:59,889
We could put them in the dark.
No one would see them. It's...

1302
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:01,157
- Yeah.
- In the shadows.

1303
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:03,392
Long lens, backlit,
in and out of shot.

1304
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:04,994
That's great. Melanie?

1305
00:58:05,127 --> 00:58:06,195
It can work. It can work.

1306
00:58:06,328 --> 00:58:07,263
- Thanks, Nick.
- Sorry.

1307
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:09,265
It was intended as a joke.

1308
00:58:09,398 --> 00:58:11,200
Can't help it
if my jokes are so shit,

1309
00:58:11,333 --> 00:58:13,769
they get mistaken
for serious suggestions.

1310
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:20,876
I do like a, um,
tightly stuffed vine leaf.

1311
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:24,079
Hey. Took him a while,

1312
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:25,781
but he's settling down now.

1313
00:58:27,783 --> 00:58:29,718
- Beautiful creatures.
- Yeah.

1314
00:58:29,852 --> 00:58:31,720
- I love their hair.
- Yeah.

1315
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:34,823
The mane is actually connected
to sexual selection.

1316
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:37,593
- There it is, mate, right there.
- Heh-heh-heh.

1317
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:39,028
All right, mate, in a bit.

1318
00:58:42,831 --> 00:58:45,234
You wanna fight? Or are you
like the Cowardly Lion

1319
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:46,969
from <i>The Wizard of Oz?</i>

1320
00:58:47,102 --> 00:58:50,039
Put them up. Put them up.

1321
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:01,450
I was reading about Oedipus
on Wikipedia.

1322
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:03,085
The way Sophocles intended.

1323
00:59:04,987 --> 00:59:07,623
- Joke.
- It said he had to kill his dad

1324
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:10,926
because as a young man, he had
been the guest of another king

1325
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,229
and had violated
the laws of hospitality

1326
00:59:13,362 --> 00:59:16,065
by abducting and raping a boy.

1327
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:19,235
And people say
<i>EastEnders</i> is dark.

1328
00:59:22,805 --> 00:59:24,673
Amanda!

1329
00:59:24,807 --> 00:59:27,142
- Here, you look exhausted.
- Oh, thanks.

1330
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:29,645
I'm knackered.

1331
00:59:29,778 --> 00:59:34,283
We were, um, just talking about
Greek tragedy and... And stuff.

1332
00:59:34,416 --> 00:59:35,951
How Oedipus killed his father

1333
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:39,255
as punishment for all
the terrible things he'd done.

1334
00:59:39,388 --> 00:59:40,956
It's more about fate.

1335
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:44,526
Fate because he needs
to be killed.

1336
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,931
Oh, that was my skin.
You just poked my skin.

1337
00:59:49,064 --> 00:59:51,200
I look ridiculous.

1338
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:53,269
- You don't.
- You look lovely.

1339
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:58,674
Yeah, you look like, uh,
Aphrodite's, uh, Irish granny.

1340
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,076
You always were
a show-off, Ricky.

1341
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,879
I'm not doing it for me.
I'm doing it for everyone else.

1342
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:06,782
It's about showing me
and us respect.

1343
01:00:06,915 --> 01:00:10,052
What is all this about?
Gladiators and lions and...

1344
01:00:10,185 --> 01:00:11,920
What do you mean?
Bread and circuses.

1345
01:00:12,054 --> 01:00:15,291
- What people want. They love it.
- It must be costing a fortune.

1346
01:00:15,424 --> 01:00:17,860
It is. That's the whole point.

1347
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,995
To show those bastards.

1348
01:00:20,129 --> 01:00:22,298
Now, in 2012, you bought a yacht

1349
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:24,099
costing 100 million pounds.
Correct?

1350
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:26,535
Uh, bit more
after it was kitted out.

1351
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:30,139
And your clothing lines are
endorsed by many celebrities.

1352
01:00:30,272 --> 01:00:33,142
Uh, wealthy, beautiful people.

1353
01:00:33,275 --> 01:00:36,979
And yet the workers in your
factories, 80 percent women,

1354
01:00:37,112 --> 01:00:39,581
are paid $5 for a 12-hour day.

1355
01:00:39,815 --> 01:00:41,850
I don't own any factories.

1356
01:00:41,984 --> 01:00:43,986
I make a deal with the supplier.

1357
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:46,889
It's up to them how they,
uh, operate their factory.

1358
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,925
Right, but you're very happy
to use their factories.

1359
01:00:50,059 --> 01:00:52,328
It's the market, with respect.

1360
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:54,296
It's, uh... You know,
the same factories

1361
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:59,134
are supplying Zara,
H&M, Marks and Spencers.

1362
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:02,838
- "Happy birthday, Sir Richard."
- Everyone smile. Yeah?

1363
01:01:02,971 --> 01:01:04,073
Okay. Ready?

1364
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,175
And one, two, three.

1365
01:01:06,308 --> 01:01:08,977
Happy birthday, Sir Richard!

1366
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:10,879
Yeah, great. I bought that.

1367
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,384
Hello? Are you filming?

1368
01:01:15,517 --> 01:01:18,587
- Well, I'm writing a book.
- You're filming. Good story.

1369
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:20,956
- I don't have time. I'm sorry.
- Come and see.

1370
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:23,592
Come and see where we live.
Come and see.

1371
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:27,129
Well, someone's picking me up
in a minute, but...

1372
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:34,103
- I live here.
- You live here?

1373
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:35,371
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1374
01:01:35,504 --> 01:01:38,107
More than hundred people live.

1375
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,777
More than a hundred people
live here? Right. Yeah.

1376
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:42,177
No running water.

1377
01:01:42,311 --> 01:01:45,782
You use the well
instead of plumbing, right.

1378
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,817
How long have you lived here?

1379
01:01:52,187 --> 01:01:54,022
- Fifteen years.
- Fifteen years.

1380
01:01:54,156 --> 01:01:55,958
And how many hours a day
do you work?

1381
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:00,462
Twelve hours.

1382
01:02:00,596 --> 01:02:04,133
How much do you get paid
for a 12-hour day?

1383
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:12,374
Eight hundred rupees.

1384
01:02:12,508 --> 01:02:13,843
- Eight hundred?
- Yeah.

1385
01:02:13,976 --> 01:02:16,445
That's less than
4 pounds a day, I think.

1386
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:18,447
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1387
01:02:33,262 --> 01:02:34,963
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

1388
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,368
Ah...

1389
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:42,137
Look at that.
You can't buy a view like that.

1390
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:43,939
Oh, wait, no, I have.

1391
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:48,243
What have
they got to sing about?

1392
01:02:48,377 --> 01:02:51,413
Right. The look-alikes.

1393
01:02:53,282 --> 01:02:55,417
I can't... I can't...
I can't see this.

1394
01:02:55,551 --> 01:02:56,920
- It's too sunny.
- Oh, hang on.

1395
01:02:57,052 --> 01:02:59,421
I've got some printouts. Here.

1396
01:02:59,555 --> 01:03:01,056
George Clooney.

1397
01:03:02,124 --> 01:03:03,158
He's having a laugh.

1398
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:05,227
It's just a bloke
with gray hair.

1399
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,130
Samuel L. Jackson. That's just
a black man in a curly wig.

1400
01:03:08,263 --> 01:03:10,466
That's borderline racist.

1401
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,404
Adele. Yeah, she looks
like Adele. Johnny Depp.

1402
01:03:15,537 --> 01:03:18,273
It's just a bloke
in a fucking pirate costume.

1403
01:03:18,407 --> 01:03:20,275
We'll bring
special makeup artists in.

1404
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:22,244
You'll need
a fucking plastic surgeon.

1405
01:03:22,377 --> 01:03:24,881
Heh, maybe it should be
a masked ball.

1406
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,749
Yeah? Who the fuck asked you?

1407
01:03:26,982 --> 01:03:28,550
No. Sorry.
You're absolutely right.

1408
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:31,520
We need to go to the kitchen.
Chef's ready for that tasting.

1409
01:03:31,653 --> 01:03:34,924
Oh, God.
What are you doing down here?

1410
01:03:35,057 --> 01:03:37,727
The workers have stopped.
They've done seven days running.

1411
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:39,194
That's the maximum permitted.

1412
01:03:39,328 --> 01:03:42,397
Fucking EU
fucking health and safety.

1413
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:44,433
They should be grateful
they're working,

1414
01:03:44,566 --> 01:03:46,936
the state this country's in.
Pbbt!

1415
01:03:47,069 --> 01:03:49,505
Right. Give me some Roman
costumes and a pack of cards.

1416
01:03:49,638 --> 01:03:52,775
Do I have to do
everything myself?

1417
01:03:58,647 --> 01:04:00,582
You want a cup of tea?

1418
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:03,418
- Oh, yeah. I'd love a cup of tea.
- Have a seat.

1419
01:04:03,552 --> 01:04:06,154
- What do you got? Fruit?
- Yeah.

1420
01:04:06,288 --> 01:04:08,190
Trying to keep regular.

1421
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:11,326
Counteract the fucking feta.

1422
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:14,998
- Hello.
- Hello. Who's in charge?

1423
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:16,532
- It's this guy. This one.
- Who?

1424
01:04:16,665 --> 01:04:18,667
- You in charge?
- You can talk to me.

1425
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:22,005
Okay, right, I want
to ask you a question. Uh...

1426
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:23,806
Are you a...?

1427
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:25,942
Are you a gambling man?
You like a wager?

1428
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:29,177
We came in so small boat.
That's big risk.

1429
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:32,782
Yes. Well, that's a good point.
Uh, I've got a proposal for you.

1430
01:04:33,016 --> 01:04:34,449
All you have to do
is play my game.

1431
01:04:34,583 --> 01:04:36,019
And if you win, I'll give...

1432
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:38,086
You can stay here,
do what the fuck you like.

1433
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:40,088
I'll give you $100,000 in cash.

1434
01:04:40,222 --> 01:04:42,558
Spend it on yourself or your
people. Whatever you want.

1435
01:04:42,692 --> 01:04:44,192
- And if I lose?
- Right.

1436
01:04:44,326 --> 01:04:47,162
If you lose, you have to clear
off the beach,

1437
01:04:47,296 --> 01:04:49,531
and then you have to come work
for me, painting.

1438
01:04:49,665 --> 01:04:51,466
And, uh, everyone here
has to dress up

1439
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,136
in these clothes at my party.

1440
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:57,974
- What's your game?
- It's called Find the Lady.

1441
01:04:58,106 --> 01:05:00,342
- Right? Come. Come here.
- Find the Lady.

1442
01:05:02,144 --> 01:05:04,313
Come here.
Let's play Find the Lady.

1443
01:05:06,816 --> 01:05:10,687
Right. All you gotta do
is keep your eye on the queen.

1444
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,690
Okay, do you want to do
a trial run, uh, with Melanie?

1445
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:15,424
- A trial run...
- No, thank you.

1446
01:05:15,557 --> 01:05:18,061
- We can do it with Sherine.
- All right, sweetheart.

1447
01:05:18,193 --> 01:05:21,330
Uh, all you gotta do is keep
your eye on the queen. Right?

1448
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:24,566
All right, she's moving,
she's grooving,

1449
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,635
she's moving, she's grooving,
she's moving.

1450
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:28,537
Can you find the lady?

1451
01:05:33,141 --> 01:05:34,343
Ah, she did it! All right.

1452
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,848
- Well done.
- Maybe we are more clever.

1453
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:42,384
Yeah, maybe. Okay, your turn.
There's a queen.

1454
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:47,456
She's moving, she's grooving,
she's moving, she's grooving,

1455
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:49,424
she's moving, she's grooving.

1456
01:05:49,558 --> 01:05:51,326
Okay. Find the lady.

1457
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:58,333
- The one in the right.
- Sure you don't mean the middle?

1458
01:05:58,467 --> 01:06:00,202
No, I told you,
the one on the right.

1459
01:06:00,335 --> 01:06:02,137
All right. All right.

1460
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:10,113
Oh, and it was the middle one
too. Tried to help you.

1461
01:06:10,245 --> 01:06:12,381
Never mind. That's the way
the cookie crumbles.

1462
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:14,684
All right, go do painting.
You go with Melanie.

1463
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,451
Clean all this crap
off the beach.

1464
01:06:16,585 --> 01:06:18,553
- Whoa, you tricked us, man.
- No, no, no, mate.

1465
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:22,224
It's a wager.
Some you win, some you lose.

1466
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:24,127
Then how much you pay for us?

1467
01:06:24,259 --> 01:06:25,728
I didn't mention anything
about money.

1468
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:27,096
It's work, man.

1469
01:06:27,229 --> 01:06:28,664
What's the minimum wage
in Greece?

1470
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:31,400
- Five euros.
- Five euros an hour. Not bad.

1471
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:34,569
- And we wear this costume?
- Yeah, our guests are arriving.

1472
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:37,439
- You need to look like them.
- Why do we need to wear it?

1473
01:06:37,572 --> 01:06:39,942
We all have to wear them.
All the workers.

1474
01:07:21,951 --> 01:07:27,322
- Hey, Amanda. How's it going?
- I'm a slave. What do you think?

1475
01:07:27,456 --> 01:07:30,459
Right. Well, slaves can
always revolt.

1476
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:32,527
If we've learned
nothing else from Brexit,

1477
01:07:32,661 --> 01:07:34,197
and I'd argue that we haven't,

1478
01:07:34,329 --> 01:07:36,565
it's that the voice
of the dissatisfied underclass

1479
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:38,300
can still make itself heard.

1480
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,703
Shut up, Nick.

1481
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:44,306
No, yeah, f-f-fair comment.

1482
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:48,543
- Are you okay?
- No.

1483
01:07:48,678 --> 01:07:52,314
Right, look. Look. Do you wanna
come in here a minute? Just...

1484
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:57,552
- Thanks.
- H-h-have a seat. Um...

1485
01:07:57,687 --> 01:08:02,257
And, look, do... Do you
wanna tell me what's wrong?

1486
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:06,461
Or it's fine
if you don't want to.

1487
01:08:06,595 --> 01:08:08,463
You know I told you
about my aunt working

1488
01:08:08,597 --> 01:08:10,733
- in that factory in Colombo?
- Yeah.

1489
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:13,335
Well, my mum worked
with her too.

1490
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:17,572
<i>They made clothes for lots
of different brands,</i>

1491
01:08:17,707 --> 01:08:19,842
<i>including McCreadie.</i>

1492
01:08:19,976 --> 01:08:23,813
<i>You know what he's like.
He drives a hard bargain.</i>

1493
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:25,782
<i>Everyone does.</i>

1494
01:08:27,516 --> 01:08:29,484
- How much for this?
- It's $10.

1495
01:08:29,618 --> 01:08:30,820
Fuck off.

1496
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:33,655
- Have I got a handle on my head?
- What?

1497
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,026
Have I got a handle
on the side of my head?

1498
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,360
What?

1499
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:40,062
I'm asking you
in a very clever way

1500
01:08:40,295 --> 01:08:43,632
if I look like a fucking mug.

1501
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:47,837
<i>Every year, there would be
pressure to reduce prices.</i>

1502
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,437
<i>If the price goes down,</i>

1503
01:08:49,571 --> 01:08:51,841
<i>the factory still
has to make money.</i>

1504
01:08:53,943 --> 01:08:55,912
- Everything okay, sir?
- Excellent, thank you.

1505
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:57,713
I might even give you a tip.

1506
01:08:57,847 --> 01:09:00,216
<i>So, what happens?</i>

1507
01:09:02,651 --> 01:09:05,054
<i>The workers have
to work faster.</i>

1508
01:09:10,592 --> 01:09:13,796
<i>My mum wasn't fast enough
for the new targets.</i>

1509
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:17,233
<i>So when she got ill, they took
their chance and sacked her.</i>

1510
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:45,328
<i>Well, she got a job
in another place,</i>

1511
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:46,729
<i>but it was a right dump.</i>

1512
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:51,399
It was overcrowded and noisy.

1513
01:09:57,155 --> 01:09:58,115
Fire!

1514
01:09:58,198 --> 01:09:59,608
Fire!

1515
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:16,852
My mum suffocated.

1516
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,055
Oh, God.

1517
01:11:20,122 --> 01:11:22,590
That's why I came to England.

1518
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:24,860
And now look at me.

1519
01:11:24,994 --> 01:11:27,396
I'm Greedy McCreadie's slave,

1520
01:11:27,529 --> 01:11:30,565
working at
this ridiculous party.

1521
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,905
You're only dressed
as his slave. You...

1522
01:11:36,038 --> 01:11:38,207
You're not actually a slave.

1523
01:11:38,441 --> 01:11:40,409
When you bought Monda,

1524
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,412
it was part of
the Ethical Trading Initiative.

1525
01:11:43,545 --> 01:11:45,982
- You pulled it out.
- Waste of time.

1526
01:11:46,115 --> 01:11:47,750
Would you care
to expand on that?

1527
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:51,053
It's a colossal waste of time.

1528
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:55,691
Excuse me.

1529
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:57,426
Is this part of
forensic evidence?

1530
01:11:57,559 --> 01:11:59,594
- No, sir.
- Then why the stinking fuck

1531
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:01,430
is it covered in fingerprints?

1532
01:12:01,563 --> 01:12:03,966
Fucking clean this, or it'll
become forensic evidence

1533
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,633
in your murder investigation.

1534
01:12:05,768 --> 01:12:06,902
No more marks on glasses,

1535
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:08,738
or I'll shove them
up your asses.

1536
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,439
Keith Richards is late.

1537
01:12:10,572 --> 01:12:12,274
You'd better mean late
as in "dead."

1538
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:14,609
He's on his way.
He's just delayed in Athens.

1539
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:17,880
I'm not paying
that fossilized shit goblin

1540
01:12:18,014 --> 01:12:19,715
$800,000 to be fashionably late.

1541
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:21,484
I'm paying him a dollar
a wrinkle

1542
01:12:21,616 --> 01:12:24,920
to show that elephant scrotum
he calls a face at my party.

1543
01:12:25,054 --> 01:12:26,956
- I've broken this. Look at that.
- Oh, what?

1544
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:28,891
Stems are made of shit.

1545
01:12:29,025 --> 01:12:32,461
Can we get that sorted, please?
Take that off. Thanks.

1546
01:12:32,594 --> 01:12:34,529
- What's his excuse?
- I don't know.

1547
01:12:34,662 --> 01:12:36,664
It's your job to know.

1548
01:12:36,799 --> 01:12:39,702
It's a know job. Don't say
that's sexual harassment

1549
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:41,303
because it rhymes
with "blow job."

1550
01:12:41,536 --> 01:12:43,538
Call Keith Richards' handlers
and tell them

1551
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:44,840
I want him here in one hour

1552
01:12:44,974 --> 01:12:46,574
grinning like a tramp
who's won the lottery,

1553
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:48,010
which is basically what he is.

1554
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:51,080
Guys, you go now.
You need to go. Out of here.

1555
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:00,089
What's going on?
Oi, what's going on?

1556
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:02,691
It's the refugees.
They're slowing everything down.

1557
01:13:02,825 --> 01:13:06,128
Tell them to get out.
It's not their party.

1558
01:13:06,262 --> 01:13:08,898
Soup kitchen's over!
Back to work!

1559
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,968
Hey, look. Just calm down.

1560
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:15,104
Just calm down.
I'll deal with it.

1561
01:13:15,237 --> 01:13:17,073
- Demetrious, stop shouting.
- Tell them to go!

1562
01:13:17,206 --> 01:13:19,641
Tell them to leave the food
and go, please!

1563
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:22,144
- Amanda. Amanda.
- Come on. Come on, you.

1564
01:13:22,278 --> 01:13:24,046
- You ready to go out and work?
- Amanda.

1565
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,915
- Was that tasty?
- Get them out of here!

1566
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:29,185
There's about five or six
of them. I'll introduce you now.

1567
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:31,020
Make sure
they don't talk to anyone.

1568
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,855
I once had
a Gary Glitter look-alike

1569
01:13:32,988 --> 01:13:34,757
who just kept bothering people.

1570
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:36,826
Can't get arrested now.

1571
01:13:36,959 --> 01:13:38,994
Not something that was
a problem for Gary.

1572
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:41,497
Hey, everyone. Sir Richard.

1573
01:13:41,629 --> 01:13:42,565
- Hello.
- Hi.

1574
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:43,833
- Hello.
- Hi, Sir Richard.

1575
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,901
Yep, Simon Cowell. He's good.

1576
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:47,870
- Yeah, Simon Cowell there.
- Who are you?

1577
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:50,005
- Adele.
- Course you are. Yeah.

1578
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:53,542
- Who's the guy with the bandana?
- It's Rod Stewart.

1579
01:13:53,676 --> 01:13:57,146
Looks like Rod Stewart's
bitter older brother.

1580
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,082
And who's she?

1581
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:03,853
- Kylie.
- Kylie Minogue.

1582
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:07,323
At a push. She'll have
to wear a name badge.

1583
01:14:09,024 --> 01:14:11,760
- Is that George Michael?
- He's amazing.

1584
01:14:11,894 --> 01:14:14,163
Apparently, he can sing as well.

1585
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:16,599
George Michael's fucking dead.

1586
01:14:16,732 --> 01:14:19,101
I think the agency sent anyone
they had on their books.

1587
01:14:19,235 --> 01:14:21,103
Well, put the ghost
of George Michael

1588
01:14:21,237 --> 01:14:22,872
back on a plane
to Club Tropicana.

1589
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:24,240
Drinks are not free for him.

1590
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:27,009
I'm tired of these
cheeky Greek chancers.

1591
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:38,954
Great.

1592
01:14:39,088 --> 01:14:42,725
Oh, and I want the AC set
at 68 degrees in every room.

1593
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:44,593
I was at Gareth's party.
It failed

1594
01:14:44,727 --> 01:14:46,661
and the pillow chocolates
melted.

1595
01:14:46,795 --> 01:14:49,298
Looked like the tooth fairy
was having a dirty protest.

1596
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:04,013
- Babe, how do I look?
- You look gorgeous.

1597
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:16,258
"My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1598
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:19,161
commander of
the Armies of the North."

1599
01:15:19,295 --> 01:15:21,163
Yeah? Keep going.

1600
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:23,933
"General of the Felix Legions,

1601
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:26,869
loyal servant
to the true emperor,"

1602
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:28,904
Richus Greedus.

1603
01:15:29,038 --> 01:15:34,678
"Father to a murdered son,
husband to a murdered wife."

1604
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:36,680
Go south to my troops.

1605
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:39,848
What?!

1606
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,985
It's Finn. I...

1607
01:15:43,118 --> 01:15:45,120
- I've got you a present.
- Go away!

1608
01:15:52,228 --> 01:15:54,096
- Go on. Keep going.
- Okay. Um...

1609
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:56,799
"My name is
Maximus Decimus Meridius,

1610
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:59,868
- commander of the Armies..."
- Wait. Sorry. I've gone soft.

1611
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:01,203
I've gone soft.

1612
01:16:01,337 --> 01:16:02,972
- Oh, Finn.
- He's ruined it.

1613
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:04,306
- Sorry.
- Oh, fine.

1614
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,292
You look like the goddess
Aphrodite

1615
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:24,893
rising up from the spume,

1616
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:27,663
only much, much lovelier.

1617
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,498
Did Roman women wear stilettos?

1618
01:16:29,733 --> 01:16:31,367
So you're excited
about the party, yeah?

1619
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:34,136
- I'm excited about Daddy's party.
- Great. Great.

1620
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:43,946
Cheers.

1621
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,750
Hey. There you go.
Oh, you're here, finally.

1622
01:16:46,882 --> 01:16:48,951
Adrian. Fucking hell, mate.

1623
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:50,552
- You look great.
- You look fantastic.

1624
01:16:50,786 --> 01:16:52,756
You look like
a gladiator already.

1625
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:55,391
You look like
a smashing slave boy.

1626
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:59,261
Ladies and gentlemen, I think
we all know why we are here.

1627
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:01,563
We are here
to celebrate the birthday

1628
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:05,200
of a self-made man
who worships his creator.

1629
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:08,971
In fact, once the youngest
self-made billionaire

1630
01:17:09,104 --> 01:17:11,240
in British history, he is now

1631
01:17:11,373 --> 01:17:13,208
virtually Britain's oldest man.

1632
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:14,744
Despite the fact
that we're here

1633
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:16,211
to celebrate his 60th birthday,

1634
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:18,180
Sir Richard still has
his own hips,

1635
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:20,784
his own teeth.
At least I think they're teeth.

1636
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:23,152
They're something vaguely
resembling teeth, at any rate.

1637
01:17:23,285 --> 01:17:26,155
And thank goodness, of course,
he has his own marbles.

1638
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:27,923
Uh, which,
in true British fashion,

1639
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:29,558
he stole from the Parthenon.

1640
01:17:29,793 --> 01:17:31,795
Cue the VT.

1641
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:33,329

01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,520
I feel like I'm
in <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

1675
01:19:04,653 --> 01:19:07,857
Yeah, and we're the mechanicals.

1676
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:10,592
- It's set in Greece.
- Is it?

1677
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:20,703
Right now. Right now.

1678
01:19:20,936 --> 01:19:23,305
Kiss! Kiss!

1679
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:27,976

1687
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:51,099
Hi.

1688
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:53,903
- Hi, Finn.
- Fancy bumping into you here.

1689
01:20:16,024 --> 01:20:17,526
Good night, Sir Stephen.

1690
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:20,295
It's just Stephen.
I'm not a knight.

1691
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:23,365
Aren't you? My son is.

1692
01:20:23,499 --> 01:20:26,201
Yes. Yes, he is.

1693
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:32,140
I need to see what's in the bag.

1694
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:33,910
These are our things.
Give me the bag.

1695
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,310
- Hey!
- Come on, give me!

1696
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:37,012
- What's going on?
- Call the police.

1697
01:20:37,145 --> 01:20:38,547
These bastards
have been stealing!

1698
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:40,282
- They're just children.
- Go!

1699
01:20:41,517 --> 01:20:43,619
Stop! Call the police.

1700
01:20:43,753 --> 01:20:46,923
- I'm not calling the police.
- Stop! Stop it! Come back!

1701
01:20:47,055 --> 01:20:48,758
- Stop!
- Shit. Hey!

1702
01:20:55,297 --> 01:20:56,799
Come back!

1703
01:21:00,269 --> 01:21:01,971
- Run!
- Stop! Stop! Stop it!

1704
01:21:09,111 --> 01:21:10,579
Hey, hey. Oi.
Put the camera down.

1705
01:21:10,713 --> 01:21:13,615
Put the camera down,
you sneaky little wanker.

1706
01:21:15,785 --> 01:21:17,586
- Stop!
- Hey!

1707
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,354
Stop!

1708
01:21:19,488 --> 01:21:21,557
Stop! Stop!

1709
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:25,828
Stop! Stop, stop!

1710
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:31,099
They stole our cutlery.

1711
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,101
- Hey, stop it!
- Calm down, stop.

1712
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:35,370
- They need to bring it back.
- No worry, no worry.

1713
01:21:35,504 --> 01:21:37,573
They need to give... It's our...

1714
01:21:43,412 --> 01:21:46,248
I told you stop! Stop!

1715
01:21:48,216 --> 01:21:53,255
Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Stop it!

1716
01:21:53,388 --> 01:21:56,458
- Did you call the police?
- No, I didn't. They're just kids.

1717
01:21:56,592 --> 01:21:59,161
We are fucking human.
We don't need that again.

1718
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:00,529
No, I know. I know.

1719
01:22:02,765 --> 01:22:04,701
Kareem. Kareem, listen, please.

1720
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:08,270
We don't need to listen.
We don't need to listen.

1721
01:22:08,403 --> 01:22:10,572
It's the last.
We don't need to talk anymore.

1722
01:22:10,707 --> 01:22:14,576
That's finished.
We are going to go home now.

1723
01:22:17,379 --> 01:22:19,214
It's nice they can be friends.

1724
01:22:19,348 --> 01:22:21,084
I mean, they're the same age,
after all.

1725
01:22:21,216 --> 01:22:22,384
Yeah, all right.

1726
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:30,359
All right. Time-out.

1727
01:22:36,632 --> 01:22:38,868
All right, sunshine,
time for you to go to bed.

1728
01:22:39,102 --> 01:22:40,469
Fuck off, Dad.

1729
01:22:40,602 --> 01:22:41,838
Go to bed.

1730
01:22:43,106 --> 01:22:44,406
Get!

1731
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:48,678
Finn.

1732
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:53,582
Hi!

1733
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:06,428
Kareem, I just...
I wanna help. I'm on your side.

1734
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:08,430
What help you talking about
all the time?

1735
01:23:08,563 --> 01:23:11,400
Fighting isn't
gonna solve anything.

1736
01:23:13,435 --> 01:23:15,071
Look, Kareem.

1737
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:20,275
- The police will come, for sure.
- Really? We are not thieves.

1738
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:22,779
I know, but the children,
they've got the cutlery.

1739
01:23:22,912 --> 01:23:24,312
Haven't you?

1740
01:23:24,446 --> 01:23:26,281
Do you wanna arrest them?

1741
01:23:26,415 --> 01:23:28,151
Do you wanna put them in prison?

1742
01:23:28,283 --> 01:23:31,253
Even they lost
their father and their mother?

1743
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:33,588
You know, Sherine's mum
is my sister in Syria.

1744
01:23:33,723 --> 01:23:35,692
I promised her
that I would look after her.

1745
01:23:35,825 --> 01:23:39,361
- Look at us now, we are slaves.
- I know. I know, Kareem.

1746
01:23:39,494 --> 01:23:42,230
If they keep the silver,
they're gonna get into trouble

1747
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:44,701
and that isn't gonna help them.

1748
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,573
I'm going to ask you a question.
Answer honestly.

1749
01:23:51,657 --> 01:23:54,660
Do you have the cutlery?

1750
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:57,746
Be honest, do you have it?

1751
01:23:58,997 --> 01:24:00,499
Give it to me.

1752
01:24:07,089 --> 01:24:09,883
I can forgive you.

1753
01:24:13,863 --> 01:24:16,298
- Here's your silver.
- Thanks, Kareem.

1754
01:24:35,985 --> 01:24:37,419
Clarence.

1755
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:41,356
Clarence! Come here.

1756
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:46,495
Shh! Wanna try some of this?

1757
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:48,296
Oi! What are you doing?

1758
01:24:50,398 --> 01:24:51,333
Fucking Arab!

1759
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:53,770
Fuck off!

1760
01:24:53,903 --> 01:24:54,837
You all right, boy?

1761
01:24:57,339 --> 01:25:00,275
Oh, now you wanna eat. Typical.

1762
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:02,779
Bloody Arabs.

1763
01:25:02,912 --> 01:25:04,312
Hey.

1764
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:05,848
- You guys want some champagne?
- Hey.

1765
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:07,549
- No, thank you.
- Yeah, why not?

1766
01:25:07,683 --> 01:25:09,351
- Come on.
- See you in our suite.

1767
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,386
I want to shower and freshen up.

1768
01:25:13,022 --> 01:25:14,422
- Don't be too long.
- Right.

1769
01:25:14,556 --> 01:25:18,560
- Good night, Naomi.
- Good night, Samantha.

1770
01:25:18,694 --> 01:25:22,732
So, what's
a pretty little thing like you

1771
01:25:22,865 --> 01:25:24,700
doing all alone
on a night like this?

1772
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:29,437
- Francois went to bed.
- Did he?

1773
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:32,641
Was thinking
of going for a walk.

1774
01:25:32,775 --> 01:25:34,877
Why don't you tag along?

1775
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:36,746
I'm so tired, I'm gonna sleep

1776
01:25:36,879 --> 01:25:38,881
- until <i>my</i> 60th.
- Come on.

1777
01:25:40,515 --> 01:25:42,517
Which, as you know,
is 40 years away.

1778
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:45,688
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

1779
01:25:45,822 --> 01:25:46,756
Good night.

1780
01:25:58,301 --> 01:25:59,434
Grow up.

1781
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:02,772
- I'll be along in a minute.
- No, you won't.

1782
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:04,406
Yeah.

1783
01:26:10,913 --> 01:26:12,949
Hey. It's all right.

1784
01:26:15,318 --> 01:26:16,618
Shh, shh, shh.

1785
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:20,790
You all right, mate?

1786
01:26:32,534 --> 01:26:37,539
"I knew a man who once said,
'Death smiles at us all.

1787
01:26:38,808 --> 01:26:41,543
All a man can do
is smile back.'"

1788
01:26:43,045 --> 01:26:45,380
You seen <i>Gladiator?</i>

1789
01:26:45,513 --> 01:26:46,682
"When a man sees his end...

1790
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:51,854
...he knows there must be
some reason to his life.

1791
01:26:51,988 --> 01:26:54,957
How will the world speak my name
in the years to come?

1792
01:26:56,959 --> 01:27:00,629
Will I be known
as a philosopher,

1793
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,497
a warrior,

1794
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:04,532
or a tyrant?"

1795
01:27:09,005 --> 01:27:10,438
What's the matter, Clarence?

1796
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:14,343
Fucking hell. All right, mate,
I'm on your side.

1797
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,763
I'm not afraid.
I've never been afraid.

1798
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,669
You can smell that, can't you?

1799
01:27:40,803 --> 01:27:43,538
You can smell that I'm brave.

1800
01:27:43,672 --> 01:27:45,440
I'm like you.

1801
01:27:46,842 --> 01:27:49,679
I'm a lion. A lion king.

1802
01:27:52,148 --> 01:27:53,215
Lionheart.

1803
01:27:54,516 --> 01:27:57,720
Richard the fucking Lionheart.

1804
01:27:58,854 --> 01:28:00,089
All right. Just a trip.

1805
01:28:01,424 --> 01:28:03,192
Look at me. I'm here.

1806
01:28:03,426 --> 01:28:04,559
I'm not trying to escape.

1807
01:28:06,195 --> 01:28:08,197
I love you.

1808
01:28:08,431 --> 01:28:10,532
I respect you.

1809
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:12,868
But I don't fear you.

1810
01:28:13,002 --> 01:28:16,839
I... fear nothing.

1811
01:28:56,145 --> 01:28:57,512
Clarence!

1812
01:29:06,989 --> 01:29:10,525
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1813
01:29:10,658 --> 01:29:14,063
Literally bloody hell!

1814
01:29:16,732 --> 01:29:18,666
What are you gonna do?

1815
01:29:19,769 --> 01:29:21,037
I don't know.

1816
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:22,938
I... I've never witnessed

1817
01:29:23,072 --> 01:29:25,708
big-cat manslaughter before,
have I?

1818
01:29:25,841 --> 01:29:28,044
I've gotta go.

1819
01:29:34,984 --> 01:29:36,285
Clarence!

1820
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:53,002
Oh, shit.

1821
01:29:58,908 --> 01:30:01,911
Ambulance. We need...
We need an ambulance.

1822
01:30:03,611 --> 01:30:07,683
To the amphitheater.
Ambulance now!

1823
01:30:07,817 --> 01:30:10,585
- Sorry. I must have overslept.
- Fuck off, Keith!

1824
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,221
Did I miss something?

1825
01:30:43,886 --> 01:30:46,388
<i>Police in

as celebrations</i>

1832
01:30:59,735 --> 01:31:01,971
<i>for Sir Richard's
60th birthday began.</i>

1833
01:31:02,104 --> 01:31:04,406
<i>The lion, reportedly called
Clarence, has been put down.</i>

1834
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:07,843
<i>Sir Richard had recently
faced criticism</i>

1835
01:31:07,977 --> 01:31:09,845
<i>following
the collapse of M&J...</i>

1836
01:31:12,281 --> 01:31:14,649
- Nick, it's Charles here.
- Hi, Charles.

1837
01:31:14,783 --> 01:31:17,920
<i>Congratu-fucking-lations.
We've hit the jackpot.</i>

1838
01:31:18,053 --> 01:31:19,788
- Have we?
- <i>We have a bidding war</i>

1839
01:31:19,922 --> 01:31:21,724
for the serialization rights.

1840
01:31:21,857 --> 01:31:23,392
<i>Sunday Times</i> and the <i>Mail.</i>

1841
01:31:23,626 --> 01:31:26,362
Mm, I'm not a big fan
of the <i>Mail.</i>

1842
01:31:26,629 --> 01:31:30,966
- Well, are you a big fan of 100K?
- Yes.

1843
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,402
<i>Don't worry.</i>
Sunday Times <i>has offered 200.</i>

1844
01:31:33,636 --> 01:31:35,271
<i>That's enough to keep you
in Sugar Puffs</i>

1845
01:31:35,404 --> 01:31:36,671
<i>for another six months.</i>

1846
01:31:36,805 --> 01:31:38,908
They're Rice Krispies, actually.

1847
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:40,743
Yeah, well, this is
manna from heaven.

1848
01:31:40,876 --> 01:31:43,078
- What about the family?
- <i>I've spoken to the family.</i>

1849
01:31:43,212 --> 01:31:44,847
<i>They want you to write it</i>

1850
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:47,082
<i>before anyone else
can do a hatchet job on it.</i>

1851
01:31:47,216 --> 01:31:50,619
Three, two, one. Cue.

1852
01:31:50,753 --> 01:31:53,088
<i>Well, to discuss this,
we're joined by Nick Morris,</i>

1853
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:54,857
<i>Sir Richard's
official biographer.</i>

1854
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:56,825
<i>Nick, welcome.
Thank you for joining us.</i>

1855
01:31:56,959 --> 01:31:58,794
<i>You must have known him
pretty well.</i>

1856
01:31:58,928 --> 01:32:01,096
<i>I suppose I did get to know him
well by the end.</i>

1857
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:03,766
- Bring up one next.
- <i>What will his legacy be?</i>

1858
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:06,869
<i>Well, he was famous, of course,
as the king of the high street,</i>

1859
01:32:07,002 --> 01:32:08,871
<i>but he was
so many other things.</i>

1860
01:32:09,004 --> 01:32:10,706
<i>What was he like as a man?</i>

1861
01:32:10,839 --> 01:32:13,742
<i>He was very proud
of his immigrant roots.</i>

1862
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:16,445
<i>He was incredibly hard-working.
Very direct.</i>

1863
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,881
<i>Didn't suffer fools gladly.</i>

1864
01:32:19,014 --> 01:32:20,916
<i>What do you think made him
so successful?</i>

1865
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:22,985
<i>He wanted to win.</i>

1866
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:25,321
<i>He believed
that winning was everything.</i>

1867
01:32:25,454 --> 01:32:27,022
- Three next.
- <i>And he was willing</i>

1868
01:32:27,156 --> 01:32:29,124
<i>to do anything
in order to win.</i>

1869
01:32:29,258 --> 01:32:30,993
- And three.
- <i>Did he go too far, though,</i>

1870
01:32:31,126 --> 01:32:33,963
- <i>in his desire to win?</i>
- <i>I suppose he felt</i>

1871
01:32:34,096 --> 01:32:36,298
<i>that if you want to win,
you have to be ruthless.</i>

1872
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,479
We're in close-up.
What's that looking like?

1873
01:32:50,714 --> 01:32:53,182
Darling, keep it together.

1874
01:32:56,452 --> 01:32:58,754
Lily. You okay?

1875
01:32:58,887 --> 01:33:02,057
- Fuck off!
- Really, fuck off.

Morning.

1880
01:33:30,252 --> 01:33:34,223
- Um, I'm here to see Amanda.
- I know.

1881
01:33:34,356 --> 01:33:36,925
I know why you're here.

1882
01:33:37,059 --> 01:33:40,329
She's a good girl.
I want you to know that.

1883
01:33:40,462 --> 01:33:43,165
I know. That's why I've come.

1884
01:33:43,299 --> 01:33:44,800
She's lived with
me since she was 7.

1885
01:33:44,933 --> 01:33:46,268
Thanks.

1886
01:33:47,936 --> 01:33:50,072
- Hello.
- Hello.

1887
01:33:50,205 --> 01:33:54,143
I, uh, have to, uh,
go upstairs, do something.

1888
01:33:54,276 --> 01:33:57,212
- Nice to meet you.
- And you. Yeah.

1889
01:33:57,346 --> 01:34:00,149
Look, I'm sorry I'm late.
Uh, my train was delayed.

1890
01:34:00,282 --> 01:34:02,051
- I saw you on telly.
- Right.

1891
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:04,019
My eulogy.

1892
01:34:04,153 --> 01:34:07,323
You were good. Very convincing.

1893
01:34:07,456 --> 01:34:09,291
- Sorry.
- Why sorry?

1894
01:34:09,425 --> 01:34:12,762
I'm writing a book about him,
making money out of it.

1895
01:34:12,895 --> 01:34:16,165
Well, it's not gonna be
the unvarnished truth, is it?

1896
01:34:16,298 --> 01:34:20,936
Look, I've gotta go. I've gotta
work. Gotta pay the bills.

1897
01:34:21,070 --> 01:34:24,907
- Is it okay if I walk with you?
- Sure.

1898
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,442
It's just around the corner.

1899
01:34:26,575 --> 01:34:28,911
I used to work there
in the holidays.

1900
01:34:29,044 --> 01:34:31,847
- To Rich.
- To Rich.

1901
01:34:37,052 --> 01:34:39,021
I'm just gonna say a few words.

1902
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:44,059
This is me.
This is where I'm working.

1903
01:34:44,193 --> 01:34:47,797
Well, bye, then.

1904
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:50,899
You know, the funny thing is,
when I pushed that button,

1905
01:34:51,033 --> 01:34:53,135
I didn't feel it was me.

1906
01:34:53,268 --> 01:34:55,170
I wasn't responsible.

1907
01:34:55,304 --> 01:34:58,107
It was fate operating
through you.

1908
01:34:59,274 --> 01:35:00,476
Maybe.

1909
01:35:00,609 --> 01:35:03,612
My hand moved.
Then the gate moved.

1910
01:35:03,847 --> 01:35:06,415
Then the lion moved.
Then McCreadie moved.

1911
01:35:06,548 --> 01:35:08,217
They were separate events.

1912
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:11,987
Rich knew that, uh...
That legacy was important.

1913
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:15,457
That it was important to leave
your business in good hands.

1914
01:35:15,591 --> 01:35:17,827
In the hands
of the next generation.

1915
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:20,129
Now, Rich and I were
the trailblazers,

1916
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:25,367
but you, Lily, Adrian, Finn,

1917
01:35:25,501 --> 01:35:29,972
you will guide Monda
into a new golden age.

1918
01:35:34,176 --> 01:35:36,512
Just gonna say a few words.
Just a few words.

1919
01:35:36,645 --> 01:35:38,647
Ahem. Hello.

1920
01:35:38,882 --> 01:35:40,516
It was a bit like McCreadie
paying less

1921
01:35:40,649 --> 01:35:44,286
for an item of clothing
so people have to work faster.

1922
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,288
So some of them lose their jobs.

1923
01:35:46,422 --> 01:35:48,924
So they can't feed
their children.

1924
01:35:49,057 --> 01:35:52,361
He didn't feel it was his fault.
He just offered them a price.

1925
01:35:54,129 --> 01:35:55,130
Yeah.

1926
01:35:57,966 --> 01:35:59,268
I better go.

1927
01:36:03,405 --> 01:36:04,440
Bye, then.

1928
01:36:06,341 --> 01:36:07,609
Bye.

1929
01:36:19,188 --> 01:36:20,924
<i>My dad had big shoes to fill.</i>

1930
01:36:21,056 --> 01:36:22,391
I mean, literally. Heh.

1931
01:36:22,524 --> 01:36:24,694
As he would often point out,

1932
01:36:24,928 --> 01:36:26,696
his feet were two sizes
bigger than mine.

1933
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:29,866
He had big feet. Even the lion

1934
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:31,099
couldn't finish them off.

1935
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:38,708
I believe that we're going
to build an empire

1936
01:36:38,942 --> 01:36:41,276
two sizes bigger

1937
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:44,446
than any the world of
retail fashion has seen before.

1938
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:47,015
Move over, H&M.

1939
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:48,217
Watch out, Zara.

1940
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:50,552
We are gonna be hotter,

1941
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:54,456
cooler, faster and cheaper.

1942
01:36:55,959 --> 01:36:58,093
We're gonna slaughter them
out there.
