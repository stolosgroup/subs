I don't like being back here.

320
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,326
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind.

321
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,162
Most people consider
what they're saying, social skills.

322
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,123
Jeffrey just charges right ahead.

323
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:39,378
Now, I know you understood the nature
of the confidentiality portion

324
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,423
of your severance agreement
with Brown & Williamson.

325
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,259
-Chapter and verse.
-Yeah, I know you do.

326
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:49,388
You know, I came up through sales.

327
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:51,724
One of the reasons
I was a great salesman

328
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,810
was I never made a promise
I couldn't keep.

329
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,857
I knew that if I ever broke my promise,
I'd suffer the consequence.

330
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,318
Is that a threat?

331
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,031
We worked together for,
what was it, three years?

332
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,535
The work we did here is confidential,
not for public scrutiny

333
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,286
any more than are one's family matters.

334
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,580
You're threatening my family now, too?

335
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:15,790
(CHUCKLES)

336
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,459
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.

337
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:21,587
About the direction of research here,
we may have had our differences, but...

338
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,673
Research.

339
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,551
You declare as a badge of honor you
don't even know what makes water boil.

340
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,303
Well, that's why we hire scientists.

341
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,430
(SCOFFS) Okay.

342
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,518
I don't believe that
you can maintain corporate integrity

343
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,144
without confidentiality agreements.

344
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,398
I was paid well for my work,

345
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:43,609
the health and welfare benefits
are good,

346
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:45,778
the severance package is fair.

347
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,491
I have no intention of violating
my confidentiality agreement

348
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,619
and disclosing that
which I said I wouldn't.

349
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,665
I appreciate all that, Jeff,

350
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:03,254
but upon reflection, we've decided
to expand our zone of comfort with you.

351
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,465
So we've drafted a supplement
to your agreement.

352
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:13,222
It broadly defines and expands
in more detail what is confidential.

353
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,932
Nobody will be able to say,

354
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:19,353
"Well, hell's bells, Margaret,
I didn't know that was a secret."

355
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,940
We're very serious
about protecting our interests.

356
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,859
We'd like you to sign it.

357
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,614
And if I don't?

358
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:33,034
If we arrive at the conclusion
that you're acting in bad faith,

359
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,079
we would terminate right now
payoffs under your severance package,

360
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,539
you and your family's medical benefits

361
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:42,293
and initiate litigation against you,
Mr. Wigand.

362
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:46,339
-Dr. Wigand.
-Dr. Wigand.

363
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,091
If you've examined the document,

364
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,803
you'll see it's in your own best interest
and you'll sign it.

365
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:03,814
What you're saying is it isn't enough
that you fired me for no good reason.

366
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,025
Now you question my integrity?

367
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,028
On top of the humiliation of being fired,

368
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:13,115
you threaten me,
you threaten my family?

369
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,328
It never crossed my mind
not to honor my agreement.

370
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:22,333
I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and
Brown & Williamson, too... "Fuck me"?

371
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,668
Well, fuck you!

372
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,679
I'm not sure he got the message.

373
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,557
Oh, I think he did.

I did not burn you.
I did not give you up to anyone.

about me?

your name for...

Why are Brown & Williamson...

406

How the hell do I know about
Brown & Williamson?

I do not like coincidences!

I'm a journalist.

How do I operate as a journalist?

who could provide me with information

411

before they provided me with it?

412
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,356
You came all the way down here
to tell me that?

413
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
No, I did not.

414

Big Tobacco is a big story
and you got something important to say.

415

I can tell.

00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,030
But yes, I did.

Deborah, my oldest daughter.

00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:06,904
And I'm unemployed, so
I have to protect my medical coverage.

00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,740

confidentiality agreement...

426

I will sign it.

-They're afraid of you, aren't they?
-They should be.

00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:29,593
Talk to me outside the zone
of your agreement.

00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,719
Like what?

430
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,680
Like, where'd you work
before Brown & Williamson?

Johnson & Johnson,
Union Carbide in Japan...

I was the general manager and director
of new products. I speak Japanese.

I was a director
of corporate development at Pfizer.

All health-related.

435

00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,247

are gonna make it to the semifinals?

-CEO of Johnson & Johnson.
-Yeah.

had put poison in Tylenol bottles.

442
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,315
He didn't argue with the FDA,

443
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,067
he didn't even wait for the FDA
to tell him,

444
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,820
he just pulled Tylenol off

And then he developed a safety cap.

448
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:40,581
Because as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be
a great businessman, right?

449
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,000
But he's also a man of science.

to put on the shelf

You go to work for tobacco.

459
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,609

really creative thinking,
these are core values.

might have had some positive effect,
I don't know.

468
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,714
Could have been beneficial.

469

I took the money.

what the hell is wrong with that?

00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,404
I always thought of myself as a man
of science, that's what's wrong with it.

476
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,993
Then you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.

477
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,746
Because, look, here's how it lays out.

478
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,831
If you've got vital insider stuff,

479
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,584
the American people, for their welfare,
really do need to know,

480
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:11,296
and you feel impelled to disclose it
and violate your agreement in doing so,

481
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,881
that's one thing.

482
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:16,760
On the other hand,
if you want to honor this agreement,

483
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,428
then that's simple.

484
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,473
You do so.
You say nothing, you do nothing.

485
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,685
There's only one guy
who can figure that out for you,

486
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,396
and that's you all by yourself.

nicotine is not addictive?

MAN 2: Congressman,
cigarettes and nicotine

492

the classic definitions of addiction.

493

There is no intoxication.

-Again, time is short.

496

I think each of you believe
nicotine is not addictive

497
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,945
and just would like to have this
for the record.

498
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,782
I believe that nicotine is not addictive.

-The Seven Dwarfs.
-What Seven Dwarfs?

502
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,791
The seven CEO of Big Tobacco.
Referred to this,

503
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:33,795
said they should be afraid of him.
I assume afraid of what he could reveal.

504
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,630
Now you tell me.

505
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:38,592
What does this guy have to say
that threatens these people?

506
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,678
Well, it isn't cigarettes are bad for you.

507
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,263
-Hardly new news.
-No shit.

What's this?

509
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,519
What that is
is tobacco's standard defense.

510
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,396
It's the "we don't know" litany.

511
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:55,525
"Addiction? We believe not. Disease?

-Besides, you'll never get what he's got.
-Why not?

516
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,456
Because of this guy's
confidentiality agreement,

517
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,625
he's never gonna be able to talk to you.

518
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:14,544
That's not good enough.
This guy is the top scientist

He's a corporate officer.

You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies.

529

This is a public health issue, like
an unsafe air frame on a passenger jet

530

or some company dumping cyanide
into the East River.

531
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,408
Issues like that.
He can talk, we can air it.

532
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,828
They've got no right to hide behind
a corporate agreement. Pass the milk.

They don't need the right.
They got the money.

-Oh, torture. Great ratings.

State courts. Be a witness.

555
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,741

confidentiality agreement, wouldn't it?

-What does that do?
-What do you mean, what does it do?

557
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,079
What I mean is like, how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement?

558
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,708
Because he has to reveal it
in a court of law.

559
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,336
It's on record. It's out.
It's no secret anymore.

560
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,006
So how can they restrain his speech
or retaliate? It's out in the world.

If you could engineer it into the court
record, you might have something.

They would have a hell of a time

563
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,845
trying to restrain his speech then,
wouldn't they?

Yeah, but what venue?

565
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,766
And where does he get...
Does he have killer attorneys?

566
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,852
I don't think he's got any attorneys.

567
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,481
He's gonna need attorneys who aren't
afraid of risking years of litigation

568
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,527
and millions of dollars
of their own dough in legal costs.

from coumarin to a similar flavor

937
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,310
that would give the same taste
and had been unsuccessful.

938
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,897
I wanted it out immediately.

939
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:08,527
I was told that it would affect sales,
so I should mind my own business.

940
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:13,115
I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience

941
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,700
continue with coumarin in a product
that we now knew,

942
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,619
we had documentation,

943
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,372
was similar to Coumadin,
a lung-specific carcinogen.

944
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,374
And you sent the document
forward to Sandefur?

945
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,918
I sent the document forward
to Sandefur.

946
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,379
I was told that we would continue
to work on a substitute.

947
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:29,297
We weren't going to remove it

948
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:32,467
as it would impact sales
and that that was his decision.

949
01:14:32,552 --> 01:14:37,139
In other words, you are charging
Sandefur and Brown & Williamson

950
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:39,558
with ignoring
health considerations consciously?

Most certainly.

And on March 24,

953
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:49,860
Thomas Sandefur, CEO
of Brown & Williamson, had you fired.

954

And the reason he gave you?

955
01:14:56,617 --> 01:14:58,451
Poor communication skills.

956
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,165

You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?

Yes. It produces

01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:33,814
If he lied,
he didn't disclose their information,

1240
01:42:33,898 --> 01:42:35,398
and the damages are smaller.

-Is this Alice in Wonderland?
-You said, "on this one."

If this holds up,
and it very well may not, Mike.

1244

But if it did and we aired this segment,

1245

and CBS was sued
by Brown & Williamson,

1246
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,757
I think we could be at grave risk.

1247
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:04,719
-How grave?
-Well, at the end of the day,

1248
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:07,305
because of your segment,

1249
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,808
the Brown & Williamson
Tobacco Company

1250
01:43:09,892 --> 01:43:11,935
could own CBS.

1253
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:23,780
Is CBS Corporate telling CBS News,

"Do not go to air with this story"?

1255

You're getting ahead of yourself.
We're all in this together.

We're all CBS. We'll find out soon.

There has been so much
soul searching about this Wigand.

1271
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,277
I've decided we should cut
an alternate version of the show

1272
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:45,612
without his interview.

1273

So what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
checking with outside counsel first?

-All that crap?
-That's happening.

Hopefully, we won't have to
use the alternate,

1276
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:55,455
but we should have it in the can.

1277

I'm not touching my film.

1278

-No, I'm not.

1279

We're doing this with

If you like, I can assign
another producer to edit your show.

1281
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:13,306
Since when has the paragon
of investigative journalism

1282
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,519
allowed lawyers to determine
the news content on 60 Minutes?

1283
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:18,979
HEWITT: It's an alternate version.

1284
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,691
So what
if we have an alternate version?

1285
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:25,402
And I don't think our being cautious
is so damned unreasonable.

-What?
-Yeah, I heard rumors.

1293

It's not a rumor. It's a sale.

1294

If Tisch can unload CBS
for $81 a share to Westinghouse,

1295

and then is suddenly threatened

with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit
from Brown & Williamson,

1297
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,686

could it not?

No, no, of course they're not influenced

to draw him out, to get him to trust us,
to get him to go on television.

He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement.

1318

And he's only the key witness in
the biggest public health reform issue,

1319

maybe the biggest, most expensive

in US history.

1321
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:16,888
And Jeffrey Wigand,
who's out on a limb,

1322
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:19,307
does he go on television
and tell the truth?

1323
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:21,601
Yes. Is it newsworthy?

1324
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:24,354
Yes. Are we gonna air it?

1325
01:47:24,438 --> 01:47:26,481
Of course not. Why?

1326
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:28,942
Because he's not telling the truth? No.

1327
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:32,737
Because he is telling the truth.
That's why we're not gonna air it.

1328
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:35,406
And the more truth he tells,
the worse it gets.

You are a fanatic, an anarchist.
You know that?

1330

I want half a show rather than no show.

to force it on the air?

1546

1596

has gained access
to a 500-page dossier

1597
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:05,562
on former Brown & Williamson
research head, Jeffrey Wigand,

1598
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:09,316
detailing charges of shoplifting
and failing to pay child support.

1599

WALLACE: Thousands of documents
from inside the tobacco industry

1604
02:04:39,514 --> 02:04:41,473
have surfaced over the past year.

1605
02:04:41,558 --> 02:04:43,559
Documents that appear to confirm

1606
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:45,686
what a former US surgeon general

1607
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:49,523
and the current head of the Food and
Drug Administration have been saying.

1608
02:04:50,150 --> 02:04:52,484
We learned of a tobacco insider
who could tell us

1609
02:04:52,569 --> 02:04:55,988
whether or not the tobacco industry
has been leveling with the public.

1610
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,157
That insider was formerly

1611
02:04:58,241 --> 02:05:01,368
a highly-placed executive
with a tobacco company.

1612
02:05:01,452 --> 02:05:05,164
But we cannot broadcast what critical
information about tobacco,

1613
02:05:05,248 --> 02:05:08,667
addiction and public health
he might be able to offer.

1614
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:12,588
Why? Because he had to sign
a confidentiality agreement

1615
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:14,882
with the tobacco company
he worked for.

1616
02:05:14,966 --> 02:05:18,385
The management of CBS has told us

1617
02:05:18,469 --> 02:05:20,554
that knowing he had that agreement,

1618
02:05:20,638 --> 02:05:23,098
if we were to broadcast
an interview with him,

1619
02:05:23,183 --> 02:05:27,144
CBS could be faced
with a multi-billion dollar lawsuit.

1620
02:05:27,228 --> 02:05:30,898
The fact is, we are not allowed
even to mention his name

1621
02:05:30,982 --> 02:05:33,525
or the name of the company
he worked for.

1622
02:05:33,610 --> 02:05:37,946
And, of course,
we cannot show you his face.

02:11:13,824 --> 02:11:15,700
Yeah, I will.

I'm Lowell Bergman.
I'm from 60 Minutes.

1692
02:11:32,635 --> 02:11:34,678
You know, you take the 60 Minutes
out of that sentence,

1693
02:11:34,762 --> 02:11:36,596
nobody returns your phone calls.

1694
02:11:37,306 --> 02:11:40,308
Maybe Wigand's right.
Maybe I'm hooked.

1695
02:11:42,395 --> 02:11:44,229
What am I hooked on?

1696
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:46,606
The rush of 60 Minutes?

1697
02:11:47,441 --> 02:11:50,735
What the hell for? "Infotainment"!

1698
02:11:50,820 --> 02:11:52,946
It's so fucking useless, all of it.

1699
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:56,616
So it's a big country with a free press.
You can go and work somewhere else.

1700
02:11:56,701 --> 02:11:58,952
"Free press"? The press is free.

1701
02:11:59,036 --> 02:12:02,622
For anyone who owns one.
Larry Tisch has a free press.

1702
02:12:02,707 --> 02:12:05,000
-Get some perspective, Lowell.
-I got perspective.

1703
02:12:05,084 --> 02:12:07,085
No, you do not.

1704
02:12:08,504 --> 02:12:10,964
From my perspective,

1705
02:12:11,048 --> 02:12:14,759
what's been going on and
what I've been doing is ridiculous.

1706
02:12:14,844 --> 02:12:17,220
-It's half-measures.
-You're not listening.

1707
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:26,563

before you do it.

-Patch him through.

SCRUGGS: Well, Lowell,
you are not gonna believe this.

1713
02:13:16,614 --> 02:13:20,742
The governor of Mississippi
is suing his own attorney general

1714
02:13:20,826 --> 02:13:23,495
to abandon litigation
against Big Tobacco.

1715

Oh, good.

1716
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:29,334
But now that the version
without Jeff ran,

1717
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:31,836
what's the chance of getting
his interview on the air?

1718
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:36,341
-Hello?
-Yeah, I'm here.

1719

What chance is there of getting
Jeff's interview on the air?

Less than great.

how important it was
in the court of public opinion.

1744
02:15:56,857 --> 02:16:00,485
Brown & Williamson's chief
executive officer, Thomas Sandefur.

02:16:00,569 --> 02:16:03,154
I believe that nicotine is not addictive.

1746
02:16:03,239 --> 02:16:05,406
I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself

1747
02:16:05,533 --> 02:16:07,408
because I watched those testimonies
very carefully.

WALLACE: All of us did.

1749
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:11,454
I mean,
there was this whole line of people,

whole line of CEOs up there,
all swearing.

that their representation...

-Lowell?
-Did I tell you you were wrong?

02:19:08,882 --> 02:19:12,719
No. I'm assuming the cave-in begins

1792
02:19:12,803 --> 02:19:15,054
with the threat of litigation
from Big Tobacco.

Are we talking

1795
02:19:53,302 --> 02:19:55,344
WALLACE: Did I get you up?

1796
02:19:55,637 --> 02:19:59,724
No, I usually sit around my hotel room
dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning,

1797
02:19:59,808 --> 02:20:01,726
sleepy look on my face.

1798
02:20:03,687 --> 02:20:05,563
How many shows have we done? Huh?

1799
02:20:05,647 --> 02:20:07,899
-Come on. How many?
-Oh, lots.

1800
02:20:07,983 --> 02:20:09,150
That's right.

1801
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,238
But in all that time, Mike,

1802
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:17,116
did you ever get off a plane,
walk into a room

1803
02:20:17,201 --> 02:20:20,495
and find that a source for a story
changed his mind?

1804
02:20:22,539 --> 02:20:24,749
Lost his heart? Walked out on us?

1805
02:20:24,833 --> 02:20:27,627
Not one fucking time.
You wanna know why?

1806
02:20:28,087 --> 02:20:30,254
I see a rhetorical question
on the horizon.

1807
02:20:30,339 --> 02:20:32,215
I'm gonna tell you why.

1808
02:20:32,299 --> 02:20:35,760
Because when I tell someone
I'm gonna do something, I deliver.

1809
02:20:36,303 --> 02:20:40,098
Oh, how fortunate I am to have
Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage

1810
02:20:40,182 --> 02:20:42,892
to point me down the shining
path, to show me the way.

1811
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:45,103
-Give me a break.
-You give me a break.

1812
02:20:45,187 --> 02:20:48,314
I never left a source
hung out to dry ever.

1813
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:51,317
Abandoned. Not till right fucking now.

1814
02:20:51,944 --> 02:20:55,154
When I came on this job,
I came with my word intact.

1815
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:58,616
I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
Fuck the rules of the game!

1816
02:20:59,201 --> 02:21:01,327
Hell, you're supposed
to know me, Mike.

1817
02:21:01,411 --> 02:21:03,246
What the hell did you expect?

1818
02:21:03,330 --> 02:21:05,498
You expect me to lie down?

1819
02:21:05,999 --> 02:21:08,835
Back off? Or get over it?

1820
02:21:08,919 --> 02:21:13,381
In the real world, when you get to where
I am, there are other considerations.

1821
02:21:13,465 --> 02:21:16,592
Like what? Corporate responsibility?

1822
02:21:16,677 --> 02:21:18,594
What, are we talking celebrity here?

1823
02:21:18,679 --> 02:21:22,640
I'm not talking about celebrity,
vanity, CBS. I'm...

1824
02:21:24,184 --> 02:21:25,309
I'm talking about

1825
02:21:25,394 --> 02:21:28,062
when you're nearer the end
of your life than the beginning.

1826
02:21:29,231 --> 02:21:32,024
And what do you think
you think about then? The future?

1827
02:21:33,026 --> 02:21:35,570
"In the future, I'm gonna do this,
become that"?

1828
02:21:35,654 --> 02:21:37,822
What future? No.

1829
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:39,490
What you think is...

1830
02:21:40,909 --> 02:21:43,995
"How will I be regarded in the end,

1831
02:21:44,079 --> 02:21:45,913
"after I'm gone?"

1832
02:21:47,749 --> 02:21:50,626
Oh, along the way,
I suppose I made some minor impact.

1833
02:21:51,044 --> 02:21:55,339
I did Irangate, the Ayatollah, Malcolm X,

1834
02:21:55,424 --> 02:21:58,342
Martin Luther King,
Saddam, Sadat, etc., etc.

1835
02:21:58,427 --> 02:22:03,806
I showed them thieves in suits.
I spent a lifetime building all that.

1836
02:22:06,685 --> 02:22:10,438
But history only remembers
most what you did last.

1837
02:22:12,024 --> 02:22:15,151
And should that be fronting a segment

1838
02:22:15,235 --> 02:22:18,988
that allowed a tobacco giant
to crash this network...

1839
02:22:25,078 --> 02:22:29,582
Does it give someone
at my time of life pause?

1840
02:22:33,128 --> 02:22:34,462
Yeah.

1841
02:22:42,095 --> 02:22:43,554

This is today's New York Times.

of what went on inside our shop.

1848
02:23:07,496 --> 02:23:10,831
And in the editorial, it accuses us
