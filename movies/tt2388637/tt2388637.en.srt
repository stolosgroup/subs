anybody at all? Nope.

What about those letters?
Everyone read them before

155

they even got sent.
They don't say anything.

156
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:06,861
You want to just bring them
in anyway?

157
00:17:06,863 --> 00:17:10,999
I'll do whatever you want,
but he won't come back.

00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:15,236
He's not coming back for me if
that's what you're thinking.

159
00:17:15,238 --> 00:17:15,738
Ruth!

160
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:34,616
Did she tell you anything?
Did she tell you anything?

161
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,864
No, gene.
She didn't say a damn thing.

162
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:45,733
I'm surprised.
I thought she'd like you better

163
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:49,237
than me.
Let me have this one, huh?

164
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,339
Well, hell, pat.
You're the one he shot.

165
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:53,608
I'm gonna let you catch the son
of a bitch.

166
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,844
Yep. Sorry I'm late.

167
00:17:56,846 --> 00:18:00,248
She had to have a time-out.
She got in a fight with Miles.

168
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,651
Why did you get into a fight
with those boys?

169
00:18:03,653 --> 00:18:06,721
They called me names.
You need to have a better

170
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:08,723
reason than that.

171
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:16,725
Come on. Upsy-Daisy. Oy.

172
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:25,206
Evening.

173
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:28,910
Hi. Hey, little girl.

174
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:33,147
Hi.
Don't you look pretty today?

175
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,783
You got a birthday coming up,
don't you?

176
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:40,021
Well, you got your birthday list
put together yet?

177
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:47,462
You better get on that.
Get your mama to help you.

178
00:18:47,464 --> 00:18:53,167
I heard the news.
Anything you want to talk about?

179
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:56,137
Everyone thinks I got
something to tell them.

180
00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:02,277
I don't have a goddamn thing.
They say they traced him to

181
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,782
Montana.
You think he's in Montana?

182
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:15,490
I can make some phone calls,
see what I can do about putting

183
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:18,192
an end to all this.
I could put an end to all

184
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:24,499
this right now all by myself.
All I'd have to do is...

185
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:27,168

00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:55,269
Yeah. Is this how fellas are

213
00:23:55,271 --> 00:24:00,374
wearing their hair?

214
00:24:00,376 --> 00:24:05,780
Well, man, I just started
walking, you know... just like I

215
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:11,552
said I would.

216
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:18,025
And just walked out?

217
00:24:18,027 --> 00:24:21,128
Yep.

218
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,765
How's that work?
Well, you know, the guards...

219
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:28,803
they come by your cell every
night...

220
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:32,807
Sort of saying, "lights out" and
rattling bars with their sticks.

221
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,309
And this one guard... he used to
always joke and carry on with

222
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:39,780
us.
And one night I said, "well, I"

223
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:44,418
won't be seeing you much longer.
I figure I'll be out of here in

224
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,755
about 10 days."
He said, "how you gonna do it?"

225
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:51,325
I said, "I'm gonna just walk
right out the door."

226
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:54,695
And he said they'd stop me.
And I said, "no, sir."

227
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:58,799
I've got better things to do."
And he said, "well, that's not

228
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,769
how it works."
And I said, "well, it only works

229
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:04,205
that way 'cause you think it has
to.

230
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:08,342
See, I've got a higher calling.
I've got a wife and a little

231
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:13,814
girl who needs her daddy."
And he asked me what I know

232
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:16,250
about higher callings... says
even if I do get out, I'm gonna

233
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:21,255
have to answer to God and the
devil for the things I done.

234
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:26,594
I tell him... Shoot.

235
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:33,601
I tell him...
I tell him, "sir..."

236
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:39,140
I used to be the devil.
Now I'm just a man."

237
00:25:39,142 --> 00:25:44,311
As the days tick by...
10, 9, 8...

238
00:25:44,313 --> 00:25:52,313
and on the last day...
The bars open up, and I walk

239
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:57,725
right out.
News says you jumped off a

240
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:05,727
work truck. Yeah.

241
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:13,140
Well...

242
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:23,144
Man, have you got anything to
eat?

243
00:26:23,786 --> 00:26:27,922
I'm still a little bit hungry.

244
00:26:27,924 --> 00:26:33,494
Well, I'll find something.

245
00:26:33,496 --> 00:26:40,134
Have you seen Ruth lately?
Nope. It's been a while.

246
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:46,207
She don't live with her mama no
more.

247
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:50,377
Got a new house. A new house?

248
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:53,948
Mm-hmm. Skerritt's been
looking after her.

249
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,818
He got her all set up.
Guess I should tell you got a

250
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,355
call the other day asking about
you.

251
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:03,524
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?

252
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:07,194
I told them I hadn't seen
you, which I hadn't.

253
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:10,364
Didn't think I'd be seeing you

254
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,533
so soon. That's the truth.

255
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:46,347
I guess that's about... that's
about what I owe you.

256
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:58,399
Where'd this come from?

257
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:03,137
All over. Whose is it?

258
00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:06,373
It's mine.

259
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:17,384
Sounds like that wood's gone
soft.

260
00:30:17,386 --> 00:30:21,555
Yeah, I expect you're right.
More nails just won't hold it.

261
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:24,358
The whole gutter just comes off
the house every time it rains

262
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,126
like this.
You know, I go out there and

263
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,195
nail it back up.
Next thing you know, it's back

264
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:30,164
off.
Well, you can either do that

265
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,166
or get more buckets.

266
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:35,002
Yeah, I could do that.
That'd be easier in the

267
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:37,371
short-term, for sure.
Then I'd have to haul that water

268
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:39,139
out every time it rains.
I don't know.

269
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,475
Howdy! Howdy to you.

270
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:46,447
Yeah, all this rain we've
been having reminds me of that

271
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:50,617
one march, it was.
We'd get 101/2 inches in a day.

272
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:54,021
Man.
Oh, my middle tank out there has

273
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:56,357
gone dry, and the other two...
say, can you tell me just

274
00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:00,828
what town we're in, exactly?
This is meridian.

275
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,398
Okay. See, we passed through

276
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,167
Glen rose, but we didn't see a
sign... didn't know if we'd gone

277
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:10,504
too far, not far enough.
Well, that depends on where

278
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:14,808
you're headed.
We're headed here.

279
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,178
You, uh, plan to hunt some
deer?

280
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,882
Thinking about it.
Anyway, it rained so much, it

281
00:31:21,884 --> 00:31:24,218
filled up them tanks, and my
wife walked up there to check

282
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,653
'em the next day, and there was
catfish lyin' there.

283
00:31:26,655 --> 00:31:29,423
That thing filled up, and it was
spillin', and it had come out in

284
00:31:29,425 --> 00:31:30,657
the spill.

285
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,160
Are these real? Come again?

286
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:37,998
Are these real? You bet.

287
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,603
How old are they?
Well, that pistol goes back

288
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:46,240
125 years. You don't say.

289
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:50,477
See that scrap of paper there

290
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:53,914
next to it?

291
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:59,586
That there is a list...
Of every poor son of a bitch who

292
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:04,892
met his end at the barrel of it.

293
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:08,162
Sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to me.

294
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:14,468
Yeah, probably is.
Can I help you gentlemen find

295
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:20,240
something in particular?
Nah. Just looking around.

296
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:30,411
Is there any news?

297
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:40,561
No, not today. Uh...

298
00:32:40,563 --> 00:32:48,563
Figured you want these back.
They're just gathering dust.

299
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:52,639
You read 'em? No, ma'am.

300
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:55,909
Why not? Everyone else has.

301
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:59,012
They're not mine to read.

302
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:07,014
Can I ask you something?
Mm, sure.

303
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:15,095
Do you mean what you said
about Bob not coming back for

304
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:21,034
you? Yeah, I did.

305
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:24,738
Well, I was thinking maybe
you all'd want to get out of

306
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,544
town until all this blows over.
You mean till he gets caught?

307
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:37,751
Where would we go?
Someplace safe.

308
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:44,158
Would you come?
Someone would come with you.

309
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:52,160
I think I'll just stay here.
You know, I got to work, and

310
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:56,203
sylvie's got her birthday.
We'll be just fine.

311
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:58,639
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.

312
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:00,574
Is that right? Yep.

313
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,678
Yeah. What's she want?

314
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,648
She wants a horse.
Like, a real horse?

315
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,686
Yep. Yeah?

316
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:15,956
Where you gonna put it?

317
00:34:15,958 --> 00:34:18,225
You know what?
I know a man who... who could

318
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,327
sell you one for... for not a
bad price.

319
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:21,995
You do? I do.

320
00:34:21,997 --> 00:34:27,167
I can't take care of no horse.

321
00:34:27,169 --> 00:34:31,905
Well... No horse.
Maybe I could, uh... maybe I

322
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:35,175
could bring her something. Why?

323
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:39,613
Well, I was just doing some
cleaning, and...

324
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:42,950
I-I may have a few deals just
floating around that maybe,

325
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:44,518
uh... maybe she'd take to,
you know?

326
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,420
Just... A few deals, huh?

327
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:47,821
A few deals.

328
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:55,823
Dear Ruth...
I don't know how to start this

329
00:34:59,868 --> 00:35:02,703
letter.
I have got a million things on

330
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:05,138
my mind, and I need to get them
out.

331
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,841
I know you know I am out, and I
hope you know I am coming for

332
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:12,112
you, just like I always said.
Just like I always said I was

333
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:15,983
going to do, I am coming for
you.

334
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:19,286
I wish I were standing at your
side, whispering in your ear,

335
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:22,789
but that's not so.
I came across the woods and

336
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:29,763
mountains with no shoes on.
I traveled high and far, and now

337
00:35:29,765 --> 00:35:33,934
I am close.
I'm so close to you, I can

338
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:37,004
almost reach out and touch your
cheek.

339
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:27,682
Here you go, don.

340
00:36:43,305 --> 00:36:51,305
You boys take it easy, now.

341
00:36:52,481 --> 00:37:00,481
Well... Look at you, Bob.

342
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:10,864
Break out of parson and head
straight back here.

343
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:16,203
Maybe not the smartest move.
Long as you don't turn me in.

344
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:24,205
Where's Miles? Miles is gone.

345
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,992
Gone? Gladys is gone, too.

346
00:37:38,994 --> 00:37:46,994
It's just me now.
Well, who's running the show?

347
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:54,341
No show to run... not anymore.

348
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:59,813
Didn't this belong to Freddy?
Doubt it.

349
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:07,053
I remember playing with this.
And all those little Indians...

350
00:38:07,055 --> 00:38:09,156
have you got those Indians
someplace?

351
00:38:09,158 --> 00:38:15,328
Anything of Freddy's is long
gone.

352
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:20,066
Hmm. What do you want, Bob?

353
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:22,869
I was just wondering if you'd
heard anything.

354
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:29,910
About what?
About that local man who

355
00:38:29,912 --> 00:38:35,148
escaped from the penitentiary.
Gene dentler and a bunch of

356
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,385
his deputies come over a few
days ago for a chat.

357
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:41,254
I told them I could think of at
least six sons of bitches who've

358
00:38:41,256 --> 00:38:46,526
got a mind to see you dead but
that it'd be more fun to sit

359
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,098
back and take bets on who gets
you first.

360
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,368
You fucked over your share of
people in your day.

361
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:01,074
Yeah, and then I got caught.
Not by them, you didn't.

362
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:04,277
Well, they might as well quit
looking.

363
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:08,548
Old Bob muldoon's about to
disappear.

364
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:12,285
And where's old Bob muldoon
gonna disappear to?

365
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:19,459
I'm thinking about settling
down, build a little house, open

366
00:39:19,461 --> 00:39:23,396
a shop. I don't know.

367
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:31,271
Get old. Like you.

368
00:39:31,273 --> 00:39:34,140
On your own?

369
00:39:34,142 --> 00:39:42,142
Oh. So, I heard you bought
Ruth a house.

370
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:47,654
I'm letting her stay in one
of my old places.

371
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:51,224
It's got a big old yard where
her little girl can play.

372
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:54,661
Hey, that's my little girl,
too.

373
00:39:54,663 --> 00:40:00,233
Man, I'll tell you
she's about cute enough to make

374
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:06,506
you want to give up.
You did one thing right.

375
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:10,510
I'll give you that.
I do what I can to look after

376
00:40:10,512 --> 00:40:14,648
both of them. Yeah.

377
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,318
Well, I guess I'll handle it
from here.

378
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,289
Oh, you think so? Yes, sir.

379
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:30,291
Well, I'll tell you what.
You do whatever you want.

380
00:40:30,532 --> 00:40:35,268
You take all your money and you
get yourself as far away from

381
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,972
here as you possibly can.
But you listen to me when I tell

382
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:46,012
you...
You leave those girls alone.

383
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:53,119
I can't do that. Yeah, you can.

384
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:59,492
And why would I?
Well, now, think about it,

385
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:04,297
Bob.
If you got any trouble coming

386
00:41:04,299 --> 00:41:07,200
your way...
They sure as hell don't need

387
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:15,202
that. What trouble is that?

388
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:22,549
You got out.
What more do you want?

389
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,951
I want my family.

390
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:32,953
So do I. But I don't got it.

391
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:38,064
Now, this is how it works.
I will never hurt you more than

392
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:41,801
I'm hurting you now.
I will never lay another hand to

393
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:46,106
you or prick your finger or
pinch your cheek.

394
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:49,442
I won't call the sheriff, and I
won't tell them where you've

395
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:52,612
been. But if I hear that

396
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:57,150
old Bob muldoon has been talking
to Ruth Guthrie...

397
00:41:57,152 --> 00:42:03,089
You asked me about trouble.
I will make sure you got some.

398
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:11,091
Freddy was the one who shot

399
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:27,881
first that day.
Nobody would have gotten hurt if

400
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:33,086
he hadn't done that.
Go on, Bob.

401
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:38,892
I got to unlock my door.
Get out of here before someone

402
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:41,895
sees you.
Find yourself someplace safe.

403
00:42:41,897 --> 00:42:46,900
Where are the keys?

404
00:42:46,902 --> 00:42:48,802
In the truck. The keys?

405
00:42:48,804 --> 00:42:52,839
I'm gonna give her trouble?
I'm gonna give her trouble?

406
00:42:52,841 --> 00:42:56,176
He thinks he can buy her a
house?

407
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:57,811
No, sir.
I don't think that's how it

408
00:42:57,813 --> 00:43:00,413
works.
Ruth will walk away from that

409
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:04,851
house like it was on fire.

410
00:43:04,853 --> 00:43:07,153
Pen... I need a pen.

411
00:43:07,155 --> 00:43:10,156
Give me a pen.

412
00:43:10,158 --> 00:43:16,763
No damn sense.

413
00:43:16,765 --> 00:43:17,445
Excuse me.

414
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:41,569
Come here.

415
00:44:53,528 --> 00:45:01,528
I was thinking...
Maybe we could go on a trip...

416
00:45:06,975 --> 00:45:12,278
After your birthday.
What do you think about that...

417
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:18,318
going someplace new?
Just get in the car and drive

418
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,288
and drive. Be real fun.

419
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:30,290
Hey!

420
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:33,867
Hey, hold on.

421
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:43,871
Let me see that. Give it here.

422
00:45:54,356 --> 00:46:02,356
There you go. Come on. Go.

423
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:24,117
What do you think about me
closin' up... take you for a

424
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,887
ride somewhere...
Get away for a little bit?

425
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:30,323
Hmm?

426
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:36,896
Hey, sweetie.

427
00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:40,400
How you been? Just fine.

428
00:46:40,402 --> 00:46:44,837
Break the law or something?

429
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,107
No.
I just hadn't seen you around in

430
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:51,911
years, it feels like.
I stay put.

431
00:46:51,913 --> 00:46:55,515
You want something to drink?
No, sir. Thank you.

432
00:46:55,517 --> 00:46:58,785
We're looking for an old friend
of yours.

433
00:46:58,787 --> 00:47:02,355
I'm sure you heard the news.
Yeah. Yeah.

434
00:47:02,357 --> 00:47:05,658
A couple cops came by from
Monroe's asking questions.

435
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:10,363
All right. Have you seen him?

436
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:14,567
Sure haven't. Look, all right.

437
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:19,038
You mind if I take a look
around?

438
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,177
Billy, mind the bar?
Hope we can make this quick.

439
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:27,180
Don't want to rile up my
customers.

440
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:31,451
Haven't heard from him since

441
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:33,386
last winter.
He sent me a letter.

442
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:37,757
You write him back? Nope.

443
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:40,693
Weren't you part of his old
gang... Bob muldoon,

444
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:43,796
Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?
Nope. Got out of that racket.

445
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:49,335
Got myself this business.

446
00:47:49,337 --> 00:47:57,337
Hell.
Left the darn key downstairs.

447
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,448
Well... Hold up.

448
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:27,501
I'm gonna need to get back to
the register before too long.

449
00:48:33,148 --> 00:48:41,148
Been using it as a bookmark.
I guess I lost my place.

450
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:56,903
Ruth give it to you?
She mailed it.

451
00:48:56,905 --> 00:49:02,909
Asked me, uh... asked me to send
it on to Bob.

452
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:06,579
You never did.
Like I said, I'm bad with

453
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:11,651
correspondence. How long ago?

454
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:17,123
How old's the little girl?
3, going on 4.

455
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:22,829
About that long, then. Okay.

456
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:28,134
Uh, mind if I hang on to this?
By all means.

457
00:49:28,136 --> 00:49:30,870
I'm sure you'll call us if
you hear anything.

458
00:49:30,872 --> 00:49:32,872
Sure bet.

459
00:49:32,874 --> 00:49:40,874
Look at this.

460
00:49:41,716 --> 00:49:48,988
This is the first thing you ever
wore, the day you were born.

461
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:56,990
You were so tiny.
Look how small it is.

462
00:49:57,065 --> 00:50:00,299
I brought you home, and you
slept and slept for hours.

463
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:05,838
You were such a good little
girl.

464
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:11,310
I'll bring this with us just
because...

465
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:17,116
We might need it someday.
"And the little horse picked up"

466
00:50:17,118 --> 00:50:22,355
his shoes and ran until he was
out of the dark woods.

467
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:24,590
He came to the river where the
fish had been.

468
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:27,627
The fish was gone now, and there
was no one there to stop him

469
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:31,664
from crossing.
He crossed the river and climbed

470
00:50:31,666 --> 00:50:37,837
"the hill, and before too long,
he could see home."

471
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:44,010
What's wrong, sweet girl?
Why are you so quiet?

472
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:49,081
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just wait and see, okay?

473
00:50:51,186 --> 00:50:59,186
Have you heard from Bob?

474
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:27,113
Why don't you come in? No.

475
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:31,751
I know Bob's been around.
Will you see to it that he gets

476
00:52:31,753 --> 00:52:36,155
this? What is it?

477
00:52:36,157 --> 00:52:41,894
You can read it if you want.
I figure you will anyway.

478
00:52:41,896 --> 00:52:49,502
If you see him...
Can you tell him...

479
00:52:49,504 --> 00:52:51,671
Just... just give it to him.

480
00:52:51,673 --> 00:52:59,673
Dear Bob...
I hope you never get this.

481
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:19,231
I want you to come through that
door, take us away just like you

482
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:27,233
always said. But you can't.

483
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:32,745
You can't come here... not right
now.

484
00:53:32,747 --> 00:53:37,817
And I can't go with you.
If you come here, they'll catch

485
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:41,487
you.
If we go with you, they'll find

486
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:46,058
us. It can't end like that.

487
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,463
I can't let it end like that,
not for us...

488
00:53:50,465 --> 00:53:56,335
And not for sylvie.
I can't let that happen.

489
00:53:56,337 --> 00:54:03,909
So, we're gonna go.
If you come looking for us here,

490
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:08,147
we'll be gone.
I'll go somewhere where no one

491
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:14,920
knows who we are, or we can wait
for the time to be right and the

492
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:20,793
world to forget about us.
I don't know how to explain this

493
00:54:20,795 --> 00:54:26,832
any better, but I know you know
what I'm talking about.

494
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:30,770
We've waited so long.
We've just got to wait a little

495
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:33,773
longer.

496
00:54:33,775 --> 00:54:40,212
Come find us. I know you will.

497
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:48,214
I hope you will.
We'll find each other.

498
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:52,258
I love you so much. I do.

499
00:54:52,260 --> 00:55:00,260
It's time to wake up, baby girl.

500
00:55:18,286 --> 00:55:26,286
Sweet pea...

501
00:55:28,596 --> 00:55:33,399
Good morning. Happy Birthday.

502
00:56:40,401 --> 00:56:41,285
You seen him?

503
00:58:12,193 --> 00:58:19,765
We stopped by his girl's place.

504
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:27,767
Hartigan said to tell you
something if we ran into you.

505
00:58:33,714 --> 00:58:37,816
What's that?

506
00:58:37,818 --> 00:58:43,455
Shit, I forgot. Oh.

507
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:48,193
Let me tell you something.
You take that and do what you

508
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:53,198
will.
And if you don't find him...

509
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,135
That don't give you cause to
come back here.

510
00:58:56,137 --> 00:59:01,306
You understand?
Don't think I'm washing my hands

511
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:05,844
of all this.
And if you set foot in this town

512
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:10,349
again...
If you even think about bringing

513
00:59:10,351 --> 00:59:16,121
those girls into this...
I'll kill you.

514
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:19,892
And that'll be that. Dude.

515
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:27,399
Warren Miller.
Who makes up the names?

516
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:30,202
They ain't made up.
They're real folks.

517
00:59:30,204 --> 00:59:33,372
I mean, they're dead, but...
They're real.

518
00:59:33,374 --> 00:59:36,775
Oh, really? Mm-hmm.

519
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:39,545
So I'm told.
Ruth and sylvie, too?

520
00:59:39,547 --> 00:59:44,450
Yep. Nobody's gonna be asking

521
00:59:44,452 --> 00:59:47,820
after us? Not anymore.

522
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:50,189
Good job.

523
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:53,559
You make a wish?
What did you wish for?

524
00:59:53,561 --> 00:59:56,228
I'm not telling. All right.

525
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:58,931
You keep your little secret,
huh?

526
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:09,102
How do I look?
You look like you.

527
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:37,836
Then that'll do.
The way I see it, I didn't waste

528
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,173
my time.
You remember old Joe cranston?

529
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:44,910
Yep.
Remember that time he and I

530
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:46,578
went up to St. Louis? Mm-hmm.

531
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:49,815
He spent about three hours
getting prettied up before we

532
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:50,983
got in the car to go up there.
I said, "Joe, what are you"

533
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:54,787
doing?"
He said, "well, in case anything

534
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:59,057
happens to me, I want to make
sure my mama can recognize me."

535
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:01,727
So he put on this coat he had
when he was 12 years old, and he

536
01:01:01,729 --> 01:01:04,096
tried to button it up, and he
was a big old boy, and it ripped

537
01:01:04,098 --> 01:01:07,766
right out the back.
And he kept that thing on all

538
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:10,702
the way up to St. Louis and back
down to Texas.

539
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,205
He looked like a damn
raggedy Ann.

540
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:16,141
And when we got back, I said,
"Joe, you know your mama would

541
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:18,477
have recognized you if something
happened to you."

542
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:21,380
He said, "yeah, 'cause I had my
coat on."

543
01:01:21,382 --> 01:01:23,882
I mean, he didn't get it.
You see, people... they don't

544
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:26,251
know things the way that they
think they know them.

545
01:01:29,757 --> 01:01:36,628
Sylvie... she's gonna know me.

546
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:43,335
She'll know me without looking
at me.

547
01:01:43,337 --> 01:01:49,274
And Ruth... by God, she'll feel
me coming down the street.

548
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:54,847
I mean, we always just been...
You know, just two parts of the

549
01:01:54,849 --> 01:02:00,252
same.
I mean, we would fight, and we'd

550
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:05,324
fight like two kids with a ball.
And she'd rip through the house

551
01:02:05,326 --> 01:02:09,328
like she was on fire, and I'd
just want to hold her.

552
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,330
I'd just want to hold her.

553
01:02:11,332 --> 01:02:13,398
But she'd be yelling and
flapping around so quick, it was

554
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:20,439
like a hummingbird.
I'd say, "Ruth..."

555
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:23,709
You can scream at me till your
voice is gone...

556
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:27,346
But it doesn't make much
difference...

557
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:31,083
Because when you're all done
screaming...

558
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:36,054
"It's just gonna be you and me
sitting here in a room."

559
01:02:36,056 --> 01:02:40,859
And she said, "that's right.
It's always just gonna be the"

560
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:45,864
"two of us."

561
01:02:45,866 --> 01:02:53,866
Look how pretty that is.
You like that?

562
01:03:01,348 --> 01:03:04,750
Happy Birthday.

563
01:03:04,752 --> 01:03:11,490
Well, there's, uh, one
last... Surprise, I suppose.

564
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:15,127
You know how to open these?

565
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:18,797
All right. Let's open her up.
Yeah.

566
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,868
Okay.
So, this was mine when I was

567
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:26,138
about your size.
Let's see how it looks on you.

568
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:33,345
Say hi to Ruth for me?
I'll tell her.

569
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:37,015
I guess I hope I never see
you again.

What are you doing here?

Well, I didn't mean to wear

No. I just want to know.
Just happy to be here.

You're planning on leaving?

Yes, I am. All right.

No, I don't know yet... just

This has been, uh, weighing on

611
01:11:21,047 --> 01:11:26,484
me for some time.
Uh... When I was in the hospital,

01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:32,857
I wasn't, uh... I wasn't sitting
there making plans or anything.

01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:39,130
And what happened... I mean,
that's the risk.

615
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:42,967
That's... that's part of my job.
And beyond that, I don't hold it

616
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:46,237
against him to be who he was or
do what he was doing, and I

617
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:49,841
still don't.
I'm glad to be alive.

618
01:11:49,843 --> 01:11:53,945
I'm glad to know you.
And if you weren't who you were

619
01:11:53,947 --> 01:11:58,650
and had never been with him and
somehow we had still come

620
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:06,652
together right here, right now,
I wouldn't feel any different.

621
01:12:06,893 --> 01:12:13,598
Do you understand?
You remember that day?

622
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:17,135
I remember getting shot.
I remember feeling like I'm

623
01:12:17,137 --> 01:12:21,039
getting punched in the shoulder,
seeing the big old Texas sky.

624

I remember that, but, uh...
Did you see me?

625
01:12:25,011 --> 01:12:29,047
No, ma'am.
Did you hear what I said

626
01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:34,953
after? I read your statement.

627
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:38,957
It wasn't all true, you know.
I wasn't just a little girl who

628
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:42,126
got dragged in over her head.
I knew what I was doing.

629

Well... I think that, uh...

630
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:53,104
A lot of things were said that
might not have been true.

But you did what you did.
So did he.

That's not so.
I've been storing things up

657
01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:02,013
all this time...
Sitting awake at night, thinking

658
01:18:02,015 --> 01:18:06,784
of all the things I want to say
to him.

659
01:18:06,786 --> 01:18:10,221
Except now I have so many
things, I don't know how I'd

660
01:18:10,223 --> 01:18:15,259
ever start.
All I had was sylvie and I.

661
01:18:15,261 --> 01:18:18,563
I didn't know how to write about
her.

662
01:18:18,565 --> 01:18:23,868
How do you write about something
like that?

663
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:29,507
I remember the day she was born.
I was so scared, and I tried to

664
01:18:29,509 --> 01:18:36,280
keep her from coming, but she
came anyway.

665
01:18:36,282 --> 01:18:38,316
And when they put her in my
arms...

666
01:18:38,318 --> 01:18:40,718
Ugh!

667
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,488
We just stared at one
another, and I thought I would

668
01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:49,427
die from all that love.
And I tried to write to him

669
01:18:49,429 --> 01:18:52,930
about it so he'd know what it
was like, but... but I just

670
01:18:52,932 --> 01:18:55,733
couldn't find the words to do it
right.

671
01:18:55,735 --> 01:18:59,871
So, I just stopped... stopped
writing to him.

672
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:05,276
I figured that I'd just tell him
all at once when I saw him.

673
01:19:05,278 --> 01:19:09,313
He'd walk through the door, and
I'd know exactly what to say to

674
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:12,283
him, and things would be the way
they used to be.

That's why I've been saving
every little thing.
