00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:13,759
What's all this here?

3
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:08,671
You may choose, members of the jury...

4
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:10,553
...to believe the prisoner...

5
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:13,213
...that, returning from a walk...

6
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,717
...he found the hanging Mrs. McGinty...

7
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:18,897
...and was about to release the rope...

8
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:21,056
...when Police Constable Wells...

9
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,558
...appeared on the scene.

10
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:26,319
On the other hand...

11
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,730
...you may think the accused
intended to cover...

12
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:31,363
...manual strangulation...

13
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,942
...of Mrs. McGinty...

14
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,739
...for motives of greed...

15
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:39,869
...with clumsy attempts
to make his mean crime...

16
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:43,079
...appear to be suicide.

17
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:51,221
Madam...

18
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,719
...either you will have to cease knitting...

19
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,390
...or I will have to cease judging.
Which shall it be?

20
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,261
It helps me to concentrate, milord.

21
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:01,767
It does not help me, madam.

22
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:05,770
Very well.

23
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:07,272
Thank you, madam.

24
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,282
Yes.

25
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,199
If what I have just said is
the truth of the matter...

26
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,990
...then the prisoner was
delayed in the execution...

27
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:18,955
...of his evil subterfuge...

28
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:21,496
...by the desperate fight of his victim.

29
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:24,953
Those scattered banknotes...

30
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,672
...that pathetic crushed rose...

31
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,832
...torn from her breast.

32
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,966
He was delayed, I say...

33
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:33,971
...long enough for the
timely intervention...

34
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,974
...of the alert Police Constable Wells.

35
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,019
Summing up for a conviction,
inspector.

36
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:44,853
- You may further think that the accused...
- Stand you a beer afterwards, Wells.

37
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:48,061
- Thank you, inspector.
...had every opportunity of knowing...

38
00:05:48,236 --> 00:05:51,854
...the unfortunate widow
kept her life savings there...

39
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,982
...instead of in the bank...

40
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,318
...and that Harold Taylor was bent on...

41
00:05:57,496 --> 00:06:00,165
...securing her meager fortune.

42
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,914
If the facts as presented to you...

43
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:05,995
...admit of any reasonable doubt...

44
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:10,003
...then the accused is entitled
to the benefit of that doubt.

45
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,881
But, members of the jury...

46
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,837
...if you have been convinced
by the evidence...

47
00:06:16,014 --> 00:06:18,137
...beyond all reasonable doubt...

48
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:22,009
...that the accused committed
this heinous crime...

49
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,186
...then it is your solemn duty...

50
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:27,226
...to return a verdict of guilty.

51
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:31,188
You will retire...

52
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:34,233
...and consider your verdict.

53
00:06:37,661 --> 00:06:41,243
Might just have time for that quick
beer before they come back, Wells.

54
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:54,381
There's absolutely no doubt
in my mind he's guilty.

55
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:58,052
He was caught red-handed
by the policeman.

56
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,023
Prisoner at the bar, have you
anything to say before l...?

57
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:11,066
Not yet, milord.

58
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:13,394
The jury is still out.

59
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,865
Surely the time is more appropriate...

60
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:20,572
...for a very dry martini, Johnson.

61
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:22,703
Very good, milord.

62
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:44,551
- Not more tea?
- No. They're coming back.

63
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,231
Members of the jury...

64
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,162
...are you agreed upon your verdict?

65
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:04,742
No, sir.

66
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,657
What did you say?

67
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:11,582
We're not able to reach an agreement,
milord.

68
00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,339
Silence. I will not have my court...

69
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,633
...turned into a bear garden.

70
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:21,964
I suggest you retire for a further period.

71
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,972
I'm afraid it would be
a waste of time, milord.

72
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:33,568
I see.

73
00:08:38,073 --> 00:08:39,353
Very well.

74
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,237
There will be a retrial at a later date.

75
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,655
Jury dismissed.

76
00:08:56,007 --> 00:08:59,293
If ever there was an
open-and-shut case, this was it.

77
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:02,139
One member of that jury was
being deliberately perverse.

78
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:05,970
Many more than one, inspector,
I assure you.

79
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:10,811
Eleven, to be precise.

80
00:09:12,566 --> 00:09:16,350
That woman's made a mockery
of my one and only murder.

81
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:26,110
No, no, no, Mr. Swanbridge.

82
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,529
You mustn't turn your back
on the audience.

83
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:32,289
I want them to see the look
of surprise on your face.

84
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,003
Allow me.

85
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:38,215
Just once more, Miss Rusty, please.

86
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,218
Right.

87
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,557
Our lady president.

88
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,433
Carry on, please.

89
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:54,100
Try again.

90
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:57,191
And do please try harder,
Mr. Swanbridge.

91
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,065
My arm's getting awfully tired.

92
00:10:00,238 --> 00:10:03,156
A little rough at the moment,
Miss Marple. But I'm confident...

93
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:05,531
...it'll be all right on the night.
- Of course.

94
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,659
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

95
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,909
- Well, you found him guilty, of course?
- They did.

96
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,364
I did not.

97
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:15,037
But, Miss Marple, surely...

98
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:19,246
You recall our production in aid
of the church organ renovation fund...

99
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:21,666
<i>... The Lodger's Dilemma?</i>
- Unforgettable.

100
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:25,177
Well, you'll remember, Mr. Stringer,
that the victim in that play...

101
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:27,754
...wore a rose to receive her paramour.

102
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,424
He murdered her, the lodger was blamed.

103
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,888
Exactly. Mrs. McGinty wore a rose...

104
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,471
...on the fatal night.

105
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,642
Would it have been
to receive her lodger...

106
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:42,401
...when we have no evidence
of any dalliance between them?

107
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,565
Oh, I hardly think so.

108
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:47,149
Then she wore it for someone else.

109
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:50,530
- Her murderer, you think?
- I do.

110
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,615
Excuse me, Mr. Stringer...

111
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,409
...I'm sorry, but he still keeps
turning away. What can I do?

112
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:58,080
We'll have to recast him.

113
00:10:58,255 --> 00:11:01,789
I know. Ask the vicar if he'll be
kind enough to have a try.

114
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,009
Yes.

115
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:07,132
Miss Marple, if what you say is so...

116
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:11,137
...then an innocent man's life may
be at stake. What can be done?

117
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:15,093
Well, we can begin by inquiring rather
more closely into the private life...

118
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:17,976
...of Mrs. McGinty than
the police have seen fit to do.

119
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,391
Yes, but how?

120
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:23,653
By returning to the scene
of the crime, as it were.

121
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,485
Oh, very good, vicar.

122
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:32,282
Excellent. Excellent!

123
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:00,396
Mr. Stringer.

124
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:04,445
If our plan works,
you're sure you know your part?

125
00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:05,893
Oh, yes. I think so.

126
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:09,524
Down. Down. You may be observed.

127
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:18,918
- Yes?
- I'm collecting...

128
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,128
No.

129
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:23,371
I'm collecting jumble
for the church bazaar.

130
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,508
You're a Christian, surely?

131
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,086
I should hope so.

132
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,178
- Well, then.
- Oh, well, if it's jumble for the church...

133
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:33,134
...there's plenty here. Come in.
- Oh, thank you.

134
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,269
Got all her stuff here, you know.
You've heard of my sister, of course.

135
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:40,898
Yes, the poor lady.

136
00:12:41,066 --> 00:12:42,940
I always thought she'd
come to a bad end.

137
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:44,687
One of those theatricals, you know.

138
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:46,937
Really? I thought she was a barmaid.

139
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,317
Oh, yes,
but she used to be on the stage.

140
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:53,279
Did it in there, you know,
with his bare hands.

141
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:54,828
Gloved ones.

142
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:57,666
Well, it comes to the same
thing in the end. This way.

143
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,620
She was always sticking
her neck out, that one.

144
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:02,703
She did leave you
her cottage, I believe?

145
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,872
Didn't have time to
arrange her will, did she?

146
00:13:05,048 --> 00:13:08,417
No, it would seem not.

147
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:11,428
Still, I mustn't decry her. My own sister.

148
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,052
Blood's thicker than water, I suppose.

149
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:16,300
Here's all her stuff. Nothing of value.

150
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:18,718
Probably got it
from a jumble sale herself.

151
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:22,478
She used to swear these
rat-tails was mink.

152
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,270
And look at this coat.
I wouldn't be seen dead in it.

153
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:29,147
Can't imagine why she dressed in these
rags when she had all that money.

154
00:13:29,322 --> 00:13:31,066
A real little slut she was.

155
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,491
I remember when she was a kid,
always wanted to be an actress.

156
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,986
An actress, I ask you.

157
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,005
Mean she was, you know, me...

158
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,880
A little touch of rheumatism.

159
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:49,041
I find this beneficial.

160
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:51,839
- Really?
- Yes.

161
00:13:56,266 --> 00:14:00,180
You should try rubbing linseed into
the joints. Makes a new woman of me.

162
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:03,105
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you very much.

163
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:05,764
That'll be the insurance man.
Paying out, you know.

164
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,612
They don't like it when
the unforeseen does occur.

165
00:14:08,778 --> 00:14:12,693
Persistence, Mr. Stringer, persistence.
Foot in door.

166
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,736
Well, I hope you've brought it in cash.

167
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:19,284
- Brought what, madam?
- Oh, come on, come on, now.

168
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:22,077
I don't want the same trouble
as when my John passed away.

169
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,037
- I don't understand.
- Well, you are from the insurance...

170
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:27,785
...aren't you?
- Oh, no, madam. No.

171
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:31,629
I was hoping to interest you
in improving your mind.

172
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,920
I was wondering if you'd
allow me to show you...

173
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:37,966
...the new Wonder Book.

174
00:14:38,517 --> 00:14:39,559
Do.

175
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:43,554
Come in, Mr... Come in.

176
00:14:55,158 --> 00:14:57,780
<i>Murder She Said, Murder She Said...</i>

177
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:00,029
<i>... Murder She Said.</i>

178
00:15:23,895 --> 00:15:28,059
And as you can see, the section on our
feathered friends is most comprehensive.

179
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:30,641
Everything from
an albatross to a shrike.

180
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,230
- A what?
- A shrike.

181
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:36,104
So named for its incessant chatter
and predatory instincts.

182
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,821
It has a habit of impaling its prey.

183
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:41,152
How interesting.

184
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:43,863
Look, I've got an old woman upstairs.
I'll just get rid of her.

185
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:47,124
- And then we'll have a cup of tea.
- Please don't, I can't trespass...

186
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,867
...on your generosity like that.

187
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,126
Oh, dear. Poor Mr. Stringer.

188
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:59,586
Fancy me mistaking you
for the insurance man.

189
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:02,220
- You're much too nice.
- Really?

190
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:05,559
Well, of course you are.
Now I come to think of it, you don't...

191
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:08,267
...really look like a salesman, do you?
- Don't I?

192
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,690
No. So you're a bachelor, Mr. Stringer?

193
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,647
- Yes.
- Oh, I can always tell.

194
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:16,197
And I'm a widow.

195
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:19,034
I'd never have believed it.

196
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:22,609
- How do you do?
- Oh, I see you've got what you wanted.

197
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,705
Yes, thank you. Perhaps the
gentleman would care to help me...

198
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:28,116
...with these into the trap.
- Oh, yes, indeed.

199
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:30,462
- Thank you.
- I'll leave you the book, Mrs. Thomas.

200
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:33,084
Brood on it, will you. Brood on it.

201
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:34,881
What about the tea?

202
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,623
Good day, Mrs. Thomas.

203
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:46,392
So you're a bachelor, Mr. Stringer.

204
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:49,811
- Not staying to tea?
- Oh, no, Miss Marple.

205
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:52,519
Dear me, the lady will be disappointed.

206
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:53,735
Up.

207
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:25,005
Miss Marple, I do assure you,
I gave that woman no encouragement.

208
00:17:25,183 --> 00:17:28,018
It's of small importance, Mr. Stringer.

209
00:17:28,186 --> 00:17:31,104
Good heavens, I've got it. Jim!

210
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:34,850
Look, there's the page of
the <i>Milchester Gazette...</i>

211
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:37,019
...I took from Mrs. McGinty's room.

212
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:40,398
Here's the identical page I obtained
from the newspaper offices.

213
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:43,693
I've snipped out the same
words and letters...

214
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,324
...and produced this.

215
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:54,921
A rose.

216
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:57,132
A rose.

217
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:13,263
Milchester 862, please.

218
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,896
Is that Lady Cynthia Waterhouse?

219
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,950
Lady who?

220
00:18:25,118 --> 00:18:28,119
No, this is Mrs. Gladys Thomas.

221
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:32,117
Oh, I'm so sorry, I appear to
have the wrong number.

222
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:35,210
As I thought, 862
is the telephone number...

223
00:18:35,378 --> 00:18:36,707
...of Mrs. McGinty's cottage.

224
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,956
- I'm afraid I'm at a loss.
- Don't you see...

225
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:42,252
...this type of message is
typical of a certain kind of criminal.

226
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:44,219
- The blackmailer.
- Who?

227
00:18:44,387 --> 00:18:47,223
Yes, I think Mrs. McGinty
may have been one.

228
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,142
- Dear me.
- Well, consider...

229
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,979
...the Cosgood Players
gave six performances...

230
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,139
...of <i>Murder She Said</i> here
in Milchester...

231
00:18:55,315 --> 00:18:57,473
...in the week of May 12th to 19th...

232
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:00,936
...the same week, incidentally,
as this issue of the <i>Gazette.</i>

233
00:19:01,112 --> 00:19:03,686
And here we have six programs.

234
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:06,902
Mrs. McGinty appears to
have attended each performance.

235
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:09,568
- Why?
- It's an excellent play, Miss Marple.

236
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:13,245
True. But I believe that her interest
was not primarily in the play...

237
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,456
...former actress though
she may have been.

238
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,961
No, I am convinced
she was a blackmailer...

239
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:22,297
...and that it was a member of this
company whom she was blackmailing.

240
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:25,634
- Her murderer, you suppose?
- I do.

241
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:29,260
Now, I think we
deserve a small beer.

242
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:31,224
Yes, please.

243
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,695
It's you, inspector.

244
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:52,697
You gave me quite a turn.

245
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:55,743
You gave me quite a turn, Miss Marple.

246
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,295
- May I come in?
- Well...

247
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:02,674
Yes.

248
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,001
It's Inspector Craddock, Mr. Stringer.

249
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:11,056
How nice. Good evening, inspector.

250
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,513
- Good evening.
- Are you here socially...

251
00:20:13,685 --> 00:20:15,891
...or officially, inspector?

252
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:18,684
Well, a little of both, shall we say.

253
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:21,146
That poses an interesting problem.

254
00:20:21,318 --> 00:20:23,809
Socially, I can offer you a small beer.

255
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:26,229
Officially, I cannot, if you're on duty.

256
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:27,449
I...

257
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:31,029
All right, Miss Marple. It's official.

258
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:33,694
Then perhaps some tea.
Won't you sit down.

259
00:20:34,164 --> 00:20:37,165
Thank you, no. This won't take long.

260
00:20:38,376 --> 00:20:42,208
We were playing anagrams,
inspector.

261
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,004
Miss Marple, Police Constable Wells
informs me that he observed you...

262
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:52,306
...this afternoon, pay a call at
the cottage of the late Mrs. McGinty.

263
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:56,216
Furthermore, you were apparently
impersonating a rag-and-bone dealer.

264
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,181
I certainly was not.

265
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,893
I was collecting jumble
for the church bazaar.

266
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,819
- Is that so?
- Well, if you don't believe me...

267
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:06,358
...I suggest you ring the vicar.

268
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:08,698
Now.

269
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:11,156
Now, look here, Miss Marple.

270
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,651
In the past you've been
of some help to the police...

271
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,287
...and we're grateful, naturally.

272
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:17,448
But at yesterday's trial,
you misguidedly...

273
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:20,115
...interfered with the course of justice.

274
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:24,125
I'd feel a lot easier in my mind,
and so would the chief constable...

275
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:27,666
...if you would promise me
here and now not to continue to do so.

276
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:30,334
You can have that
promise freely, inspector.

277
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:32,255
I have no intention whatever...

278
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,965
...of interfering
with the course of justice.

279
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:37,435
Yes.

280
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,428
Well, good.

281
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:44,648
- There's no more to be said, then.
- No.

282
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,019
Well, I'll say good night, then.

283
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:48,939
Good night.

284
00:21:49,364 --> 00:21:50,407
Yes.

285
00:21:55,912 --> 00:21:58,783
Perhaps we should have
confided our suspicions.

286
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:00,451
Certainly not.

287
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,745
That man has just
thrown down the gauntlet.

288
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,542
You know what the police are.

289
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,508
The month of September 1951.

290
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,598
This reference to a rose.

291
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,307
These things must have a great
significance...

292
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:22,478
...for our man or woman.

293
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:24,605
I suppose so.

294
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:29,143
The difficulty is,
the Cosgood Players have moved on.

295
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,313
I did read they were at
the Palace Theater...

296
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,363
...over at Halford.
- Oh, yes.

297
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:36,823
There is no doubt in my mind...

298
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:40,411
...that one of these play actors
is a murderer.

299
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:43,246
If you're convinced of
your theory, Miss Marple...

300
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:46,336
...I suppose we should,
in some way, well, act.

301
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,382
Act.

302
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:52,874
Of course. Why not?

303
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,259
That's what I must do.

304
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,680
After all, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

305
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:11,612
Take our bags to the YMCA, Jim.

306
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,816
If I'm successful,
I'll collect mine from you later.

307
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:17,280
I really think I ought to wait,
Miss Marple.

308
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:19,361
No, no, this may take some time.

309
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,198
<i>Au revoir.</i>

310
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:27,576
All I know is that we had over L300,
and now we've got nothing.

311
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:30,874
- Where's it gone? It's a simple question.
- For simple-minded people.

312
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,709
And that's mine.

313
00:23:32,926 --> 00:23:35,215
What's the use?

314
00:23:37,722 --> 00:23:39,680
Thank you.

315
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:05,158
Oh, Daddy's very democratic, George.
He doesn't mind who I marry.

316
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:08,370
- You could've put that better.
- If he's not asking for a pedigree...

317
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:12,673
...you're sitting pretty, eh, Bill?
- You could have put that a bit better too.

318
00:24:15,427 --> 00:24:18,096
I was looking for Mr. Cosgood.

319
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:22,262
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

320
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:25,435
Really? I wonder where
that could have been.

321
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:28,273
- I'm not sure.
- Probably in another dimension.

322
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,310
Don't take any notice of her.
She's our resident weirdie.

323
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:35,103
No, it was in a dream.
She and you, George.

324
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,154
Something to do with death.

325
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:43,446
Please, Eva. Can I help you?

326
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:45,910
Well, I have an appointment
with Mr. Cosgood.

327
00:24:46,082 --> 00:24:49,202
He's probably messing about on the
stage somewhere. It's over there.

328
00:24:49,377 --> 00:24:52,829
Oh, yes, thank you.
I'll find him, young man.

329
00:25:03,642 --> 00:25:05,884
Mr. Cosgood.

330
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:12,474
Mr. Cosgood.

331
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:14,311
Mr. Co...

332
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:20,573
Are you Jane Marble?

333
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:22,867
Marple, if you please.

334
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:25,657
- Very well, get on with it.
- It?

335
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:27,870
I have a performance in half an hour,
madam.

336
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:30,366
Whatever you have
chosen to do for me, do.

337
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:35,998
And throw your voice to the back of the
theater. I want to hear every word.

338
00:25:36,508 --> 00:25:38,584
I can't catch what you say.

339
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,002
I want to hear every word.

340
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:44,011
Oh, very well.

341
00:25:46,268 --> 00:25:49,434
"The Shooting of Dan McGrew"...

342
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:54,014
...by Mr. Robert W. Service.

343
00:26:07,247 --> 00:26:09,868
<i>A bunch of the boys</i>
<i>were whooping it up</i>

344
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,081
<i>In the Malamute Saloon</i>

345
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:14,708
<i>The kid that handles the music box</i>

346
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,086
<i>Was hitting a jag-time tune</i>

347
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:18,668
<i>And back of the bar</i>

348
00:26:19,384 --> 00:26:24,212
<i>In a solo game</i>
<i>Sat Dangerous Dan McGrew</i>

349
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:27,723
<i>And watching his luck</i>
<i>was his light-o '-love</i>

350
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,894
<i>The lady that's known as Lou.</i>

351
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:33,351
<i>When out of the night...</i>

352
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:42,488
<i>When out of the night that was 50</i>
<i>below And into the din and the glare</i>

353
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:46,572
<i>There stumbled a miner</i>
<i>fresh from the creeks</i>

354
00:26:46,745 --> 00:26:49,414
<i>Dog dirty, and loaded for bear</i>

355
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,748
Just give me the gist
and get to the climax.

356
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:55,872
Oh, dear me, that's very difficult.

357
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:59,047
It's a long poem,
and there's a great deal behind it.

358
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:01,922
However, as you wish.

359
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:05,178
Well, now, soon after the stranger...

360
00:27:05,347 --> 00:27:07,174
...has entered this lurid scene...

361
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:09,258
...it becomes increasingly evident...

362
00:27:09,434 --> 00:27:13,348
...that there is a growing antagonism
between him and Mr. McGrew.

363
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:18,148
An antagonism which is to end
in stark tragedy.

364
00:27:18,777 --> 00:27:21,529
Shall I pick it up at the point
when the miner...

365
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:25,646
...seated at the saloon piano,
is playing like a maniac?

366
00:27:25,826 --> 00:27:27,948
Yes, yes, please do.

367
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,744
Thank you.

368
00:27:30,288 --> 00:27:32,245
<i>Then the stranger turned</i>

369
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:35,831
<i>And his eyes they burned</i>
<i>in a most peculiar way</i>

370
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:38,624
<i>In a buckskin shirt</i>
<i>that was glazed with dirt</i>

371
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:41,169
<i>He sat and I saw him sway</i>

372
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:44,295
<i>Then his lips went thin</i>
<i>in a kind of grin</i>

373
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:47,506
<i>And he spoke, and his voice was calm</i>

374
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:51,132
<i>And, "Boys, " says he, "you don 't know</i>
<i>me and none of you care a darn..."</i>

375
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:54,761
Yes, yes, yes, but get to the point,
please.

376
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:57,892
<i>"But I want to state,</i>
<i>and my words are straight</i>

377
00:27:58,066 --> 00:28:00,142
<i>And I'll bet my poke they're true</i>

378
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:02,311
<i>That one of you is a hound of hell</i>

379
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,109
<i>And that one is Dan McGrew."

380
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:07,855
<i>Then I ducked my head,</i>
<i>and the lights went out</i>

381
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,992
<i>And two guns blazed in the dark</i>

382
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:13,780
<i>And a woman screamed</i>
<i>and the lights went up</i>

383
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:17,706
<i>And two men lay stiff and stark.</i>

384
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,124
<i>Pitched on his head,</i>
<i>and pumped full of lead</i>

385
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:23,836
<i>Was Dangerous Dan McGrew</i>

386
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:27,793
<i>While the man from the creeks</i>
<i>lay clutched to the breast</i>

387
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:31,007
<i>Of the lady that's known as Lou.</i>

388
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:42,566
<i>I'm not as wise as the lawyer guys</i>

389
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:45,309
<i>But strictly between us two</i>

390
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:49,438
<i>The woman who kissed him</i>
<i>and pinched his poke</i>

391
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:53,698
<i>Was the lady that's known as Lou.</i>

392
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:04,286
Are you still there?

393
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:11,931
You were joking, of course.

394
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:14,008
Joking? Indeed, I was not.

395
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:17,469
Then I am not joking when
I tell you that if you persist...

396
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:20,481
...in this ridiculous notion
of joining our profession...

397
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:22,807
...your wisest course
is to register at once...

398
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:25,024
...for unemployment pay.

399
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:26,986
That will not be necessary.

400
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:29,195
I am of independent means.

401
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:34,744
Dear lady, you didn't let me finish.

402
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:36,241
You made your view quite clear.

403
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:40,329
No, no, no. I was about to point out that
your performance had merit. Great merit.

404
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:42,957
Your choice of material let you down.

405
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:46,997
Yes, definitely duchess parts.
Regal roles.

406
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:50,010
I see you with other material
performing like an angel.

407
00:29:51,096 --> 00:29:52,347
Angel?

408
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:56,637
Is not that the term for a
backer of theatrical enterprises?

409
00:29:57,769 --> 00:29:59,678
Droll, very droll.

410
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:03,603
No, I simply meant you have a lot to
offer the theater, Mrs. Marble.

411
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:07,310
- Miss Marple.
- I'm delighted to hear that.

412
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:10,773
In our profession, the marital knot is
so often the bolt on the door...

413
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:12,408
...to the room at the top.

414
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:15,992
Do I take it, then, that you are
offering me employment, Mr. Cosgood?

415
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:18,914
Well, as to that,
not exactly employment.

416
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:21,371
I was thinking rather along the lines...

417
00:30:21,543 --> 00:30:24,959
...of an apprenticeship.
- Unpaid?

418
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,918
Well, in a word, yes.

419
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:31,755
- I accept.
- Splendid. Splendid.

420
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:34,004
- Welcome to the Cosgood Players.
- Thank you.

421
00:30:34,598 --> 00:30:36,886
Well, now, as to lodgings...

422
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:38,802
...I prefer to live, as it were...

423
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:41,729
...cheek by jowl with my colleagues.
- Naturally. Naturally.

424
00:30:41,897 --> 00:30:43,605
We're at Westward Ho, Prescott Street.

425
00:30:43,773 --> 00:30:46,265
Mrs. Harris, excellent landlady,
very clean.

426
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:49,894
Good. Well, I'll just pick up
my baggage at the YMCA.

427
00:30:50,071 --> 00:30:51,530
<i>Au revoir.</i>

428
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,898
- Cosgood.
- Drunk again.

429
00:30:56,077 --> 00:30:58,747
Now, look here, George.

430
00:31:07,464 --> 00:31:10,169
This man is not drunk, Mr. Cosgood.

431
00:31:10,342 --> 00:31:11,587
He's dead.

432
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,478
Poisoned.

433
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:24,647
Poisoned?

434
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,523
Poisoned.

435
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:29,223
Arsenic, I'd say.

436
00:31:29,402 --> 00:31:30,813
The autopsy will prove it.

437
00:31:30,987 --> 00:31:32,980
Nonsense. George drank too much.

438
00:31:33,156 --> 00:31:36,241
- It's as plain as the nose on his face.
- Now, sir, you say you were...

439
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:39,363
...on-stage when he came from
the direction of the dressing rooms?

440
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:43,370
Yes. Inspector, the curtain is due up in
10 minutes, and you must appreciate...

441
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:46,993
...I now have two roles to play.
- There'll be no curtain up today, sir.

442
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,459
But my audience.
They'll tear the place apart.

443
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:51,956
We'll risk that, sir.
I've got quite a few questions.

444
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:55,088
- Questions? What about?
- A man is dead, sir. It's usual.

445
00:31:55,262 --> 00:31:56,847
- And damned inconvenient.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:31:57,013 --> 00:31:58,840
Now, which was his dressing room, sir?

447
00:31:59,015 --> 00:32:01,506
Number two. Look, inspector,
can't you get George...

448
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:05,385
...off the stage and come back later?
- No, sir. Number two, you said, sir?

449
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:08,853
I knew something
was going to happen.

450
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:10,733
Really, miss?

451
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,978
Yes, I have premonitions
about these things.

452
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:14,400
I've always been like that.

453
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,316
That's very interesting.

454
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:18,235
Well, I told George...

455
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,367
...as soon as I saw
that strange woman.

456
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:23,747
- What strange woman?
- The one who came to see Driffold.

457
00:32:23,915 --> 00:32:27,747
- Driffold?
- Driffold Cosgood, inspector. Me.

458
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,876
- All right, sir, what about her?
- Her?

459
00:32:30,046 --> 00:32:32,169
- This strange woman, sir.
- Oh, her!

460
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,463
I'd just auditioned her
when George interrupted.

461
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:36,428
- Is the lady here now, sir?
- I expect so.

462
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,671
She'll be about somewhere.

463
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:40,886
Oh, she seems to have gone.

464
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:43,762
Get a name and description, sergeant.

465
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,968
Now, sir, any idea what
this lady's name is?

466
00:33:13,173 --> 00:33:14,833
I've seen this somewhere before.

467
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,297
Not that one, inspector.

468
00:33:17,469 --> 00:33:19,346
This one.

469
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:32,439
Miss Marple! I distinctly
asked you not to interfere.

470
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:35,147
- Inspector, that strange woman, it's...
- Yes.

471
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,692
Miss Marple. Allow me.

472
00:33:37,864 --> 00:33:39,987
Sergeant, would you escort
her to headquarters.

473
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:43,527
And see that she makes a complete
statement. I'll get around to her later.

474
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:47,160
After you, sergeant.

475
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:21,063
Sergeant, you're sure you didn't
mishear any of what Miss Marple said?

476
00:34:21,241 --> 00:34:23,234
I did not, sir.

477
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,197
No. Well, will you come in, please,
Miss Marple.

478
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,031
Certainly.

479
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:33,043
Almost a draw, sergeant.

480
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:39,876
- Well, please, sit down.
- Thank you.

481
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:43,086
All right, Miss Marple...

482
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:46,798
...let us suppose, just suppose,
that Mrs. McGinty...

483
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,884
...was blackmailing one of those actors.

484
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,180
And let us suppose that this was the
actual blackmail note she sent.

485
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:53,980
By all means, inspector.

486
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:57,352
Right. Now, as it was lying beside the
whiskey bottle...

487
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:00,445
...in George Rowton's dressing room,
she must have sent it to him.

488
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,482
That does spring to mind.

489
00:35:02,657 --> 00:35:05,907
- So that she was blackmailing him.
- It would appear so.

490
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:09,992
Now, if there's anything at all in what
you say, he murdered her.

491
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:12,241
On the face of it, yes.

492
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,995
So are we to suppose that today...

493
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:16,790
...in a rather belated fit of remorse,
he poisoned himself?

494
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,257
- Perhaps.
- Are we to suppose that someone else...

495
00:35:19,466 --> 00:35:21,708
...poisoned him for some reason?

496
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:24,210
Again, perhaps.

497
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,889
Inspector...

498
00:35:27,057 --> 00:35:28,468
...may I ask you a question?

499
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:32,767
- Please do.
- If you had simply found that note...

500
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:36,437
...in the victim's dressing room
and knew no more about it than that...

501
00:35:36,608 --> 00:35:38,482
...what would you have made
of the affair?

502
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:41,855
Well, I suppose I'd have thought the man
was being blackmailed...

503
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,821
...and had decided to end it all.

504
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,398
Yes, that's what I thought
you'd have thought.

505
00:35:47,953 --> 00:35:50,740
It could be the note was
left there deliberately...

506
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:53,487
...so that you would think that.

507
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:58,785
Miss Marple, it's been
a long, hard day already.

508
00:35:58,964 --> 00:36:02,463
- What are you suggesting now?
- I am suggesting that the murderer...

509
00:36:02,634 --> 00:36:05,635
...of Mrs. McGinty and the murderer
of George Rowton...

510
00:36:05,804 --> 00:36:07,464
...are one and the same.

511
00:36:09,683 --> 00:36:12,637
As to who murdered George Rowton,
I don't yet know.

512
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:14,222
But I will.

513
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:17,017
As to who murdered
Mrs. McGinty, I do know.

514
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,397
He is at present being held in
Milchester jail...

515
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:22,106
...awaiting a retrial necessitated
by the stubbornness...

516
00:36:22,279 --> 00:36:24,105
...of a certain member of the jury.

517
00:36:24,281 --> 00:36:26,404
And he killed her for her money.

518
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,651
Yes, that L100...

519
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:31,116
...that was found by her body.

520
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:34,696
Doesn't it occur to you, inspector...

521
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:38,374
...that that wasn't
Mrs. McGinty's savings at all...

522
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:39,825
...but her payoff?

523
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:43,125
Are you trying to make me believe that
whoever she was blackmailing...

524
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,167
...brought the money, killed her and then,
hearing the lodger come in, left in panic?

525
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:49,836
- No.
- Well, then, what?

526
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:51,723
I am proposing that, like the note...

527
00:36:51,892 --> 00:36:54,465
...the money
was left behind deliberately.

528
00:36:54,644 --> 00:36:56,222
What for?

529
00:36:56,438 --> 00:37:00,186
Obviously so that the police would
leap to the conclusion...

530
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:01,639
...they have leapt to.

531
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:07,032
- Now, look here, Miss Marple...
- If I were you, inspector...

532
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,116
...I would at least examine the
bank accounts of these people...

533
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:13,535
...to see if one of them
happened to withdraw L100...

534
00:37:13,705 --> 00:37:18,118
...either on or about
the time of Mrs. McGinty's death.

535
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:21,164
I will, of course,
investigate your theories.

536
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:23,295
In the meantime,
I'd be very much obliged...

537
00:37:23,465 --> 00:37:25,173
...if you would go home to Milchester.

538
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,584
I'm afraid that is out of the question,
inspector.

539
00:37:27,761 --> 00:37:30,168
My work will keep me
here indefinitely.

540
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:32,885
- Your work?
- I have accepted an engagement...

541
00:37:33,058 --> 00:37:35,347
...with the Cosgood Players.

542
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,769
And a Marple's word is her bond.

543
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:40,563
Good day.

544
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:46,817
"Actor, playwright, impresario...

545
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:49,147
...man of many talents."

546
00:37:49,324 --> 00:37:52,610
- Might have used a better photo.
- You should worry. It says here I'm 48.

547
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:54,031
Listen to this:

548
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:58,415
"Lady Sheila, stage-struck adopted
daughter of Lord Upward...

549
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:02,663
...and bride-to-be of
juvenile lead Bill Hanson, said..."

550
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:04,380
And I quote the quote:

551
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,121
"This will make no difference
to our wedding plans.

552
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,581
Daddy's very democratic."

553
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,468
Bully for Daddy, eh, Bill?

554
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:13,424
Arthur, you're an absolute stinker.

555
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:15,555
Why don't you crawl back
under your stone.

556
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:17,761
Well, well, it's all good stuff.

557
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:20,094
Absolutely no rubbish.

558
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:22,597
A little notoriety always helps
the box office.

559
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:24,482
Too true.

560
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:26,857
Have you read this about you, Ralph?

561
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:30,148
"Ralph Summers, matinee idol
of <i>Mother's Day.</i>

562
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:34,024
Now an aging, overweight
barmaid fancier."

563
00:38:34,202 --> 00:38:36,409
Let me see that.

564
00:38:39,624 --> 00:38:42,661
You're a nasty little joker, aren't you?

565
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:44,330
I think that's very funny.

566
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:48,336
- And so true.
- A nice wifely thing to say.

567
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:51,842
Well, your taste does rather run to
barmaids, doesn't it, darling?

568
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:53,803
There was that one at Milchester.

569
00:38:53,972 --> 00:38:56,807
- You remember the one...
- Shut up, Maureen.

570
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,884
- Yes, Mrs. Harris?
- Your new one's here.

571
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:03,435
Dear lady, I was beginning to fear we
had created...

572
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,604
...an unfortunate impression on you,
in view of today's accident.

573
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:10,447
Oh, no, indeed. I had a
little business to attend to.

574
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,322
Well, you're here. You're here.

575
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:14,697
Boys and girls, meet Miss Marple.

576
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:16,742
Miss Marple, the company.

577
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:20,079
- Hello.
- How do you do, everyone?

578
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:24,751
There's cocoa on the tray.
If you want the beer, it's extra.

579
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,502
- Yes, of course, a nightcap. Do sit down.
- Thank you.

580
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:31,674
Name your poison, dear lady.
I mean...

581
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:33,717
Oh, cocoa, please, Mr. Cosgood.

582
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:37,007
An excellent brew. I can recommend it.

583
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:38,593
By the way, the...

584
00:39:38,767 --> 00:39:41,056
...police are looking for you.
- Oh, yes.

585
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,473
I have spoken with them.

586
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,519
- You have? Good.
- Thank you.

587
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:47,857
I was thinking, Driffold.
Why don't we revive <i>A Kind of Murder...</i>

588
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:49,817
...as a sort of tribute to George.

589
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:53,529
Well, I mean, Miss Marple,
Dorothy here...

590
00:39:53,698 --> 00:39:55,572
...perfect for the two scheming sisters.

591
00:39:55,742 --> 00:39:59,028
- I couldn't possibly play a murderess.
- Couldn't you?

592
00:39:59,204 --> 00:40:03,154
Well, one of us could.
He or she's had practice.

593
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,827
And what's that supposed to mean?

594
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:06,626
Well, let's face it, Bill, old man.

595
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,164
Someone slipped a noxious dose
into old George's whiskey.

596
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:13,123
And that someone is in this room.

597
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:17,085
- You're ridiculous.
- No, no, no, I'm not having this...

598
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:21,048
...in front of a new colleague, too.
There's no question of George having...

599
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:23,384
...been murdered by a member
of my company.

600
00:40:23,562 --> 00:40:25,554
The whole thing is obviously
some kind of...

601
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,723
...ghastly mistake.

602
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:29,975
No, you're wrong.

603
00:40:30,944 --> 00:40:33,316
One of us is a murderer.

604
00:40:34,364 --> 00:40:36,820
And you feel that too, don't you?

605
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:39,743
Well, my dear, it's hardly
for me to say, is it?

606
00:40:39,911 --> 00:40:41,820
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Bill.

607
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:45,033
Stop talking about it.
I can't stand it any longer.

608
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,369
You know, don't you?

609
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:50,165
You know it was me.
You and your insinuations...

610
00:40:50,338 --> 00:40:52,912
...and your stupid sarcasm.
- What are you talking about?

611
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:56,092
Well, I'm going to finish you.
I'm going to close your big mouth...

612
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,301
...once and for all.
- Bill!

613
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:01,426
Let go of me! Let me go!

614
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,909
- That had you going a bit, didn't it?
- Well, l...

615
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:20,618
You know what your trouble is?

616
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:23,621
You can dish out the jokes,
but you can't take them, can you?

617
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:26,114
Well, I think that was
all in very bad taste.

618
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:27,334
Yes, so do I.

619
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:30,252
I'm sorry, love. I didn't mean to upset
anybody but him.

620
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,329
Well, you've upset me.

621
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:35,625
Oh, for heaven's sake. I've had enough
of this. I'm going to bed.

622
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:38,208
I'm feeling a bit tired myself,
Mr. Cosgood.

623
00:41:38,386 --> 00:41:39,964
If I might be shown my room?

624
00:41:40,138 --> 00:41:42,380
- Certainly. Certainly, dear lady.
- Thank you.

625
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:43,933
It's been a trying day.

626
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,808
Very trying indeed.

627
00:41:45,977 --> 00:41:47,887
Florrie! Florrie!

628
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:50,980
- So glad to be one of you. Good night.
- Good night.

629
00:41:51,858 --> 00:41:53,650
Mrs. Harris will show you up.

630
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:56,488
Come on, then. Number 10, upstairs.

631
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:58,813
Thank you, Mr. Cosgood. Good night.

632
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,528
You shouldn't take too much
notice of those youngsters.

633
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:04,239
Strange lads in some ways,
but hearts in the right place.

634
00:42:04,412 --> 00:42:05,657
I'm sure they are.

635
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:07,953
- Well, good night.
- Good night, dear lady.

636
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,369
You'll soon feel at home.

637
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:12,579
We're all one big happy family here.

638
00:42:19,511 --> 00:42:22,761
I hope you know what you're doing,
dear boy.

639
00:42:27,102 --> 00:42:29,427
You'll find this comfortable. He did.

640
00:42:29,604 --> 00:42:31,680
- He?
- The deceased.

641
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,933
- You know, Mr. Rowton.
- Oh, yes.

642
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:37,277
Well, now, breakfast 8:30.
No cooking in the rooms.

643
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:40,446
Shilling in the gas if you're cold.
Bath days, Sundays and Fridays.

644
00:42:40,615 --> 00:42:42,442
Don't waste the light.

645
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:46,362
And no male callers upstairs.

646
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,312
Naughty pussy,
what are you doing in there?

647
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:20,529
Come along. Off you go. Shoo. Off.

648
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:46,884
<i>Remember September.</i>

649
00:44:22,843 --> 00:44:23,885
Eva?

650
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:26,388
Yes?

651
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:30,305
What are you doing?

652
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:32,551
I couldn't sleep.

653
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:37,098
Why do you suppose that Marple woman
should sneak out of the house...

654
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,432
...at this time of morning?

655
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:41,602
How should I know?

656
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:44,234
Perhaps she's just eccentric.

657
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:46,731
She certainly looks it.

658
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:50,739
I wonder.

659
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,990
Oh, darling, you're not
going all creepy, are you?

660
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:56,657
Really, you could haunt a house.

661
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,620
Oh, I do wish you hadn't wakened me.

662
00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:00,954
Now I'll start fretting again.

663
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,088
I'd put it out of my mind
if I were you.

664
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:04,918
Oh, easier said than done.

665
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:07,845
I mean, well, where can one go
for a honeymoon these days?

666
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:10,171
Everywhere is so old hat.

667
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:14,683
Hey, what do you think about Moscow?

668
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,511
How can you care about that
after what's happened?

669
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:20,773
Life must go on, darling.

670
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:23,314
George or no George.

671
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:26,355
You were in love with him, weren't you?

672
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:28,742
No.

673
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,024
It was all over.

674
00:45:32,204 --> 00:45:33,663
Was it?

675
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:37,584
Yes.

676
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:41,035
I hated him.

677
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:45,880
Don't worry, darling.

678
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:48,424
I won't tell anyone.

679
00:46:09,908 --> 00:46:13,491
Good heavens, Mr. Stringer, what on
earth are you doing in that getup?

680
00:46:13,662 --> 00:46:17,161
Just training. I thought it advisable
to get into peak condition...

681
00:46:17,332 --> 00:46:19,905
...for any emergency.
Is there one already?

682
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:23,536
No emergency,
but a very interesting development.

683
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:25,753
Do stop bobbing about...

684
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:28,249
...and come over here.

685
00:46:30,262 --> 00:46:33,132
<i>Remember September.</i>

686
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,090
Not a date, a play.

687
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:40,136
And by my new employer,
Driffold Cosgood himself.

688
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:44,435
Well, you do see the
significance of this?

689
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:46,851
- No.
- Well, now, follow me, Jim.

690
00:46:47,028 --> 00:46:49,864
Follow me closely. It seems to me...

691
00:46:50,031 --> 00:46:52,154
...that whomever Mrs. McGinty
was blackmailing...

692
00:46:52,325 --> 00:46:53,950
...must have had some connection...

693
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,203
...with the production
of this play in 1951...

694
00:46:57,372 --> 00:47:00,077
...and is with the Cosgood Company.

695
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,788
- The author himself?
- Perhaps.

696
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:05,666
- How did you come by it?
- I found it on my pillow.

697
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,709
- What?
- It was left there deliberately.

698
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:10,923
Then he knows. The murderer...

699
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,170
...he's been on to you all the time.

700
00:47:13,346 --> 00:47:15,754
He's just playing
cat and mouse with you.

701
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:17,427
Well, two can play at that game.

702
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,388
Miss Marple, I'm deeply disturbed.

703
00:47:20,562 --> 00:47:22,471
Don't get yourself in a state, Jim.

704
00:47:22,647 --> 00:47:24,474
I'm not in a state.

705
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:27,983
- I'm cold.
- Oh, dear me.

706
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,488
There we are.

707
00:47:31,656 --> 00:47:34,491
That's better, isn't it?
Tuck it well round.

708
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:35,911
Now...

709
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,787
Now, what organization would
be likely to keep a record...

710
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:43,290
...of all professional
theatrical productions?

711
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,915
- The censorship people, I suppose.
- To be sure.

712
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:48,792
The Lord Chamberlain's Office in London.

713
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:52,085
I should be obliged if you would
go there posthaste...

714
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,798
...and inquire into the history
of this play...

715
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:58,340
...where it was produced in 1951,
who was in it, and so on.

716
00:47:58,517 --> 00:48:00,972
It may have been played
in many theaters.

717
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,469
I hardly think so. You see, I've read it.

718
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:08,025
Very well, Miss Marple.
I'll take the next train up.

719
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:11,811
Good. To your task. And I must fly.

720
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:15,525
I wish to be at the breakfast table
when they come down.

721
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,693
Away. Away!

722
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:26,040
Thank you, Mrs. Harris.

723
00:48:26,217 --> 00:48:27,925
I seem to be a trifle early.

724
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:30,715
No, the others are a trifle late.

725
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:32,169
Not that I'm complaining.

726
00:48:32,348 --> 00:48:35,717
If they're not down in time,
I've got six cats to feed.

727
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:39,561
- Good morning, Florrie.
- Good morning.

728
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:42,309
Good morning, good morning.

729
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:45,520
- Good morning, Mr. Cosgood.
- I trust you slept well, dear lady?

730
00:48:45,695 --> 00:48:47,070
More like a top, thank you.

731
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:50,239
Good, good. Nothing like sleep
for knitting up...

732
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:54,453
...the raveled sleeve of care,
as the Bard so aptly pointed out.

733
00:48:54,621 --> 00:48:56,779
What's that you find so engrossing?

734
00:48:56,956 --> 00:48:59,957
- Your play, Mr. Cosgood.
- What?

735
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:03,459
This is your play?

736
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,584
Yes. Yes, it is.

737
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:08,585
Where on earth did you find this?

738
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,752
In my room. Last night.

739
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:12,921
Well, now, isn't that extraordinary?

740
00:49:13,264 --> 00:49:15,802
- Yes.
- I can only assume poor George must...

741
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:17,434
...have borrowed it some time.

742
00:49:17,602 --> 00:49:20,556
- Don't let me stop you reading it.
- I've finished reading it.

743
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:25,897
Oh, well, let's see how
the good Florrie serves us today.

744
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:31,070
- How do you find it?
- The kipper?

745
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:33,114
- The play.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

746
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:35,076
The play.

747
00:49:35,286 --> 00:49:37,742
I find it most interesting.

748
00:49:37,914 --> 00:49:39,657
How very gratifying.

749
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:41,659
Has it ever been produced, Mr. Cosgood?

750
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:44,950
Oh, no.
I completed it only quite recently.

751
00:49:45,129 --> 00:49:48,296
- I see.
- I have high hopes for it, though.

752
00:49:48,883 --> 00:49:50,461
Those must sustain you.

753
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:53,304
They do, dear lady, they do.

754
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:54,722
Ralph.

755
00:49:55,473 --> 00:49:58,260
Driffold, I've been up half the night
thinking.

756
00:49:58,434 --> 00:50:00,094
Now I want to ask you a question.

757
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,312
Yes.

758
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:04,181
Could you believe in Miss Marple...

759
00:50:04,357 --> 00:50:05,637
...as a lady detective?

760
00:50:09,112 --> 00:50:12,196
- I don't know any lady detectives.
- I'm not saying you do.

761
00:50:12,365 --> 00:50:15,236
- But what do you think?
- She's hardly typecasting.

762
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,616
You're quite wrong there.
You know, she's perfect.

763
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:19,993
- What are you getting at?
- I've a marvelous idea.

764
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:22,537
- Well?
- We close the theater till Monday.

765
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:26,243
Let the publicity build up, then we
reopen with <i>Out of the Stewpot.</i>

766
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:27,831
That old potboiler.

767
00:50:28,006 --> 00:50:29,630
A murder mystery, dear boy.

768
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:32,800
We've got one of our own.
Why not put one on?

769
00:50:33,303 --> 00:50:35,509
You may have a thought here.

770
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,171
With Miss Marple as the honorable
Penelope Brown.

771
00:50:38,349 --> 00:50:41,884
Yes, now I do see what you mean.

772
00:50:42,061 --> 00:50:45,845
Yes, by Jove, it's brilliant. You're familiar
with the play, of course, dear lady?

773
00:50:46,024 --> 00:50:48,182
- No, I don't think so.
- A classic of its kind.

774
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:51,444
I'll fetch the scripts right away.
Ralph, call the theater.

775
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:53,625
Tell them we're rehearsing
on-stage for the week.

776
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:54,978
- Mr. Cosgood!
- Yes?

777
00:50:55,158 --> 00:50:58,408
I really wouldn't have thought I was
anyone's idea of a detective.

778
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:01,330
Not anyone's, dear Miss Marple,
but you're mine.

779
00:51:01,497 --> 00:51:04,035
You're certainly mine.

780
00:51:07,045 --> 00:51:08,922
And mine.

781
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,257
Spotlight!

782
00:51:15,553 --> 00:51:18,638
Get it on me and keep it on me.

783
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:23,302
Now, you've all read the play.

784
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:25,636
Let me put you in the mood.

785
00:51:26,272 --> 00:51:29,357
The scene is a filthy attic in Soho...

786
00:51:29,525 --> 00:51:34,816
...in the very heart of London's
square mile of vice and worse.

787
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:37,480
A dim figure is flitting about the stage.

788
00:51:37,659 --> 00:51:40,130
That's you, Bill. You play Sidney,
working-class assistant...

789
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:42,782
...to the honorable Penelope Brown,
amateur criminologist.

790
00:51:42,956 --> 00:51:44,331
That's you, Miss Marple.

791
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:46,871
Sidney is looking for something...

792
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:50,079
...searching, searching...

793
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:51,879
...searching.

794
00:51:52,048 --> 00:51:55,417
A noise! A step on the stair outside.

795
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:59,258
I, as the father, am about to enter
with my delinquent son, Stanley.

796
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,174
That's you, Arthur.

797
00:52:01,391 --> 00:52:02,850
Arthur.

798
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,135
Sidney freezes...

799
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:08,182
...then darts for a place
of concealment.

800
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:13,268
Sorry, guv. Testing.

801
00:52:14,195 --> 00:52:16,235
You're back.

802
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:19,572
All right, all right, don't just stand
about grinning.

803
00:52:20,118 --> 00:52:22,656
Just testing, indeed.

804
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:24,109
Now, where was I?

805
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:28,784
Yes, I come in with my son.
I plead with him...

806
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,245
...to tell the police all he knows
about the killing of Rona La Plante.

807
00:52:32,422 --> 00:52:33,797
He sneers at me...

808
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:36,290
...rejects me. Then...

809
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:38,875
...the climax of the scene.

810
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:41,461
I detect a movement
behind the alcove curtain.

811
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,513
I cross to it...

812
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:45,474
...pull it aside to reveal...

813
00:52:45,643 --> 00:52:47,636
...Sidney.

814
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:50,899
- What do you want?
- A phone call for Miss Marple.

815
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:53,438
Well, why didn't you say so?

816
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,649
All right, you're not wanted
in this scene.

817
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,611
Thank you.

818
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,323
Now, let's take it from my entrance.

819
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,483
Bill, you're concealed over here.

820
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:05,028
Arthur, you and I come in.

821
00:53:09,459 --> 00:53:11,784
You're living here?

822
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:13,337
A son of mine?

823
00:53:14,255 --> 00:53:15,506
Hello?

824
00:53:16,174 --> 00:53:17,633
Oh, yes, Mr. Stringer.

825
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,176
You were right, Miss Marple.

826
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:22,214
<i>Remember September</i>
was put on in 1951.

827
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:25,010
A tryout performance at
Pebblestone-on-Sea.

828
00:53:25,183 --> 00:53:26,558
Very interesting.

829
00:53:26,726 --> 00:53:28,351
Particularly as the author claims...

830
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,141
...that he's only recently
completed the work.

831
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:33,516
Well, that may have
been embarrassment.

832
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:36,645
You see, the Lord Chamberlain's Office
particularly remembers it...

833
00:53:36,819 --> 00:53:40,153
...because it was booed off the stage
halfway through the second act.

834
00:53:40,323 --> 00:53:43,158
That doesn't surprise me in the least.

835
00:53:43,326 --> 00:53:44,524
The point is...

836
00:53:44,702 --> 00:53:47,573
...was there anyone we know in it?

837
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:49,913
I have obtained a full cast list...

838
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:53,534
...and in it occurs the name
of Margaret McGinty.

839
00:53:53,711 --> 00:53:55,834
What? Really?

840
00:53:56,005 --> 00:53:57,749
Excellent.

841
00:53:57,924 --> 00:54:00,629
Now, tell me, apart from Mr. Cosgood...

842
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:02,296
...who else in this company...

843
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,842
...was connected with this production?

844
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:08,141
No one? You're sure?

845
00:54:11,062 --> 00:54:12,105
Yes.

846
00:54:13,356 --> 00:54:16,642
All right, Jim. I was just thinking.

847
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:20,022
Of course, it's possible that
someone has since changed...

848
00:54:20,196 --> 00:54:22,272
...his or her name.

849
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:26,194
Look, Jim, drop the cast list in to me...

850
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:28,575
...at Westward Ho, will you?

851
00:54:28,746 --> 00:54:30,122
Thank you.

852
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,282
- Goodbye.
- Marple.

853
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,747
- Oh, I'm sorry if I startled you.
- No, not at all.

854
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:37,126
Mr. Cosgood is asking
for you on the stage.

855
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:39,669
Thank you. I'll come.

856
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:45,428
This was in Props.

857
00:54:45,597 --> 00:54:47,091
It should do the job.

858
00:54:47,265 --> 00:54:48,593
All right.

859
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:50,889
Let's try it.

860
00:54:51,436 --> 00:54:53,974
There you are, dear lady.

861
00:54:54,147 --> 00:54:56,270
We've just been devising
a small embellishment...

862
00:54:56,441 --> 00:54:58,599
...to the scene
where you confront Ralph...

863
00:54:58,776 --> 00:55:01,184
...with the truth about the
killing of Rona La Plante.

864
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:04,114
Instead of, as written, him merely
knocking over the lamp...

865
00:55:04,282 --> 00:55:06,440
...and making good his escape,
Ralph suggests...

866
00:55:06,618 --> 00:55:08,610
...he also attempts to kill you.

867
00:55:08,786 --> 00:55:10,329
- Really?
- Yes.

868
00:55:10,496 --> 00:55:13,782
The idea is, he knocks over the lamp,
shoots at you and then bolts.

869
00:55:14,292 --> 00:55:16,119
- I see.
- He misses, of course.

870
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:18,288
There's nothing like a loud report...

871
00:55:18,463 --> 00:55:21,464
...for keeping an audience alive and alert.

872
00:55:24,302 --> 00:55:27,054
- You don't find this alarming, do you?
- Oh, no...

873
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:28,502
...not at all.

874
00:55:28,932 --> 00:55:29,974
Good.

875
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:33,560
Right, then let's set the scene.

876
00:55:33,728 --> 00:55:36,646
Ralph, you'll be over here...

877
00:55:36,814 --> 00:55:39,815
...rifling the escritoire.

878
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,567
And the honorable Penelope...

879
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:45,572
...will enter through the French windows
over here, right?

880
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,946
Positions, please.

881
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:57,035
Miss Marple, in now.

882
00:56:06,803 --> 00:56:09,720
I thought I'd find you here, Faber.

883
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:11,882
- You?
- Yes, me.

884
00:56:12,058 --> 00:56:15,308
- Stay where you are.
- Violence will avail you nothing.

885
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:17,518
The grounds are swarming with police.

886
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:19,017
They've got nothing on me.

887
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,646
Oh, yes, they have. You see...

888
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:25,187
You see, Mrs. McGinty's dead!

889
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:31,651
You made a mistake then, didn't you?

890
00:56:32,745 --> 00:56:34,821
You certainly did, dear lady.

891
00:56:34,998 --> 00:56:37,915
- Why, what did I do?
- You said, "Mrs. McGinty's dead."

892
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:41,370
- Did I?
- Yes. It's Rona La Plante who's dead.

893
00:56:41,546 --> 00:56:43,752
Oh, yes. How silly of me.

894
00:56:43,923 --> 00:56:45,631
I must've picked it up from reading...

895
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,125
...your <i>play, Remember September.</i>

896
00:56:48,303 --> 00:56:49,583
My play?

897
00:56:49,762 --> 00:56:51,554
There's nobody of that name in it.

898
00:56:52,265 --> 00:56:53,925
How odd.

899
00:56:55,226 --> 00:56:57,135
The name McGinty's on my mind...

900
00:56:57,312 --> 00:56:59,304
...for some reason or other.

901
00:56:59,689 --> 00:57:01,149
I know.

902
00:57:01,608 --> 00:57:05,226
It was that barmaid murdered
at Milchester.

903
00:57:05,403 --> 00:57:07,561
There was a trial last week.

904
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:10,693
Yes, that's it.

905
00:57:15,747 --> 00:57:17,786
May I try it again, please?

906
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:19,665
Yes, yes, only let's...

907
00:57:19,834 --> 00:57:21,957
...do it properly this time.

908
00:57:22,253 --> 00:57:23,913
I'll do my best.

909
00:57:24,088 --> 00:57:26,128
Positions, please.

910
00:57:27,592 --> 00:57:31,091
All right, Ralph, make your move.

911
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:47,777
Seen this in the evening paper?

912
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:49,856
"Police baffled in theater mystery."

913
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:51,359
Not that, this:

914
00:57:51,532 --> 00:57:54,617
"Grand Charity reopening Monday.
Driffold Cosgood proudly presents...

915
00:57:54,786 --> 00:57:57,952
...the company everyone is talking
about in a baffling murder drama.

916
00:57:58,122 --> 00:58:01,123
First night proceeds in aid of the
Police Benevolent Fund."

917
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:04,875
- Well, that's a nice gesture, sir.
- I can hear the chief agreeing with you.

918
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:08,462
- You got those bank statements yet?
- On your desk, sir.

919
00:58:09,092 --> 00:58:12,046
Well, did anyone draw out L100...

920
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,129
...about the time of
Mrs. McGinty's death?

921
00:58:14,305 --> 00:58:15,550
Yes, sir.

922
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:18,475
- Well, who?
- The dead man, sir. George Rowton.

923
00:58:18,643 --> 00:58:19,971
Why didn't you say so?

924
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:22,351
Well, I just did, sir.

925
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:28,018
Well, well, well.

926
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:30,187
It was as simple as that.

927
00:58:30,363 --> 00:58:32,031
Suicide.

928
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:45,373
Oh, Miss Marple,
there's a visitor for you.

929
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:48,332
- Oh, thank you.
- In there. He's a male.

930
00:58:48,506 --> 00:58:50,333
Oh, I see.

931
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,430
- Inspector.
- Good evening, Miss Marple.

932
00:58:55,638 --> 00:58:57,132
Good evening.

933
00:58:57,307 --> 00:59:00,058
I called at the police station,
and they told me you were out.

934
00:59:00,226 --> 00:59:02,848
- I'd no idea you'd come here.
- No, I don't suppose you had.

935
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:04,978
Well, your visit is most inopportune.

936
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:09,272
You see, at rehearsal today,
I set in train a certain stratagem...

937
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:12,694
...which I think will force our
murderer to make a move tonight.

938
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:14,856
I very much doubt it, Miss Marple.

939
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:17,156
Our murderer, as you put it, is dead.

940
00:59:17,327 --> 00:59:19,948
- I beg your pardon.
- Look at this.

941
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:21,496
George Rowton's bank statement.

942
00:59:21,664 --> 00:59:25,614
Important item underlined,
namely a withdrawal of L100.

943
00:59:28,755 --> 00:59:30,747
So that explains it.

944
00:59:30,924 --> 00:59:32,501
Yes, I thought you'd see the point.

945
00:59:32,675 --> 00:59:35,546
Yes, indeed. Though I must admit
the motive for the murder...

946
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,629
...of Rowton had eluded me until now.

947
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:40,047
He wasn't murdered, Miss Marple.
He killed himself.

948
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:42,597
- Oh, you really think so?
- Well, it's obvious.

949
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:46,351
Mrs. McGinty was blackmailing him.
He drew out of the bank to pay her off...

950
00:59:46,522 --> 00:59:50,022
...murdered her, and then left the money
behind to incriminate the lodger.

951
00:59:50,193 --> 00:59:53,396
- That theory has a familiar ring.
- What?

952
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:57,189
Oh, you did suggest something
along those lines. True.

953
00:59:57,367 --> 00:59:58,909
The point is the lodger's innocent.

954
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:01,947
Rowton did it and then took
what is called the easy way out.

955
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:03,450
Couldn't stand the strain.

956
01:00:03,623 --> 01:00:06,992
The case is wrapped up. I'm just
on my way to tell the chief constable so.

957
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:10,122
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why not?

958
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:11,921
Because I think you're wrong.

959
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,584
- You do?
- Yes.

960
01:00:13,758 --> 01:00:15,916
You see, I now think our murderer
got the money...

961
01:00:16,094 --> 01:00:18,632
...to pay Mrs. McGinty
off George Rowton...

962
01:00:18,805 --> 01:00:21,130
...in a way which made it necessary
for Rowton...

963
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:23,099
...to be disposed of later.

964
01:00:23,768 --> 01:00:26,935
Only a woman's mind, possibly only
yours, could have dreamt that one up.

965
01:00:27,438 --> 01:00:29,016
It may irritate you, inspector...

966
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:32,773
...that women sometimes
have superior minds.

967
01:00:32,944 --> 01:00:35,814
You'll simply have to accept it.

968
01:00:40,326 --> 01:00:42,402
Don't you need this?

969
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:45,991
Thank you. Good night, Miss Marple.

970
01:00:46,165 --> 01:00:48,538
Good night, inspector.

971
01:01:03,474 --> 01:01:06,641
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

972
01:01:40,094 --> 01:01:43,594
Oh, that's where you are. They do
like to sleep somewhere up here...

973
01:01:43,765 --> 01:01:45,425
...when they can find an empty bed.

974
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:48,221
Come on, my pretties.
Your liver's nice and hot.

975
01:01:48,394 --> 01:01:51,348
Dinner gong in two minutes.
Come on, babies.

976
01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:53,642
Come on.

977
01:02:17,131 --> 01:02:18,800
Come in.

978
01:02:19,551 --> 01:02:22,717
Miss Marple, I was hoping to catch you
before you went down.

979
01:02:22,887 --> 01:02:23,930
Were you, Mr. Cosgood?

980
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:27,051
Yes, I thought it was time
you and I had a little chat.

981
01:02:27,225 --> 01:02:30,226
That's it.
Overture and beginners, please.

982
01:02:30,395 --> 01:02:32,222
And that means you.

983
01:02:32,397 --> 01:02:34,140
No male friends in rooms, madam.

984
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:36,059
Don't be absurd, boy.

985
01:02:36,234 --> 01:02:38,559
Well, Miss Marple,
perhaps I can escort you down.

986
01:02:38,736 --> 01:02:43,233
I think I'll give dinner a miss tonight,
Mr. Cosgood. I'm feeling a trifle queasy.

987
01:02:43,408 --> 01:02:44,902
Nothing incapacitating, I trust?

988
01:02:45,076 --> 01:02:47,234
Oh, no, a good night's rest.

989
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:50,531
- Well, I'll leave you, then.
- Thank you.

990
01:02:50,707 --> 01:02:52,117
Take care, dear lady.

991
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:55,661
We mustn't be without you Monday,
must we?

992
01:02:56,254 --> 01:02:58,246
Come, Arthur.

993
01:08:11,527 --> 01:08:14,232
Oh, my dear, I was just...

994
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,668
Bitter almonds.

995
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:12,505
Cyanide.

996
01:09:34,652 --> 01:09:36,360
This is tragic.

997
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:39,151
Absolutely tragic.
When the press get on to this...

998
01:09:39,324 --> 01:09:42,194
...we could open in two theaters
and still be turning them away.

999
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:45,038
Now we're stuck without someone
to play the housekeeper.

1000
01:09:45,204 --> 01:09:48,408
- You can't have it both ways, can you?
- We must.

1001
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,326
We owe it to Dorothy.

1002
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:54,084
Eva. No, you're already doubling
the good-time girl...

1003
01:09:54,255 --> 01:09:55,880
...and the vicar's daughter.

1004
01:09:56,049 --> 01:09:59,548
Sheila, would you play the housekeeper,
dear, if I got you a wig?

1005
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:01,842
Oh, Driffy, you make me sick.

1006
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:04,255
You don't care a hoot about
poor old Dorothy.

1007
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:07,552
All you care about is your silly old
play and your stupid old self.

1008
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:11,641
And no, I won't play the housekeeper.

1009
01:10:17,028 --> 01:10:19,815
All right, Miss Marple, cyanide gas.

1010
01:10:19,989 --> 01:10:23,489
- But how?
- I think I can explain that.

1011
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,320
No doubt.

1012
01:10:25,495 --> 01:10:28,994
I take it from your tone, inspector,
that you did not have second thoughts...

1013
01:10:29,165 --> 01:10:32,700
...about seeing the chief constable
yesterday.

1014
01:10:32,877 --> 01:10:35,582
If you can explain, Miss Marple,
please do so.

1015
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:37,629
Very well.

1016
01:10:56,568 --> 01:10:57,610
Now.

1017
01:11:00,572 --> 01:11:02,564
So what? My wife has one.

1018
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:05,196
But presumably she doesn't cook
candle wax.

1019
01:11:05,368 --> 01:11:06,613
No, she doesn't.

1020
01:11:06,786 --> 01:11:10,202
There is a little at the bottom of
that saucepan.

1021
01:11:10,456 --> 01:11:12,366
Now, this is what happened.

1022
01:11:12,542 --> 01:11:15,412
The murderer set the dials
so that the gas...

1023
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:17,413
...came on at 12:55 precisely...

1024
01:11:17,589 --> 01:11:19,712
...under this saucepan that contained...

1025
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:21,590
...a small wax cup of acid...

1026
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:24,250
...and a pellet of sodium cyanide.

1027
01:11:24,429 --> 01:11:27,299
The wax melted,
the acid flowed over the pellet.

1028
01:11:27,473 --> 01:11:31,139
Result: Sudden release of cyanide gas.

1029
01:11:31,394 --> 01:11:34,265
- Lethal.
- I see.

1030
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:36,312
And at 1:00 precisely...

1031
01:11:36,482 --> 01:11:39,400
...the gas turned itself off.

1032
01:11:41,571 --> 01:11:42,614
Now.

1033
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,992
Leaving nothing but an innocent
saucepan on the hob.

1034
01:11:48,202 --> 01:11:51,821
Yes, it could work. That means
whoever we're looking for...

1035
01:11:51,998 --> 01:11:53,955
...must have specialist knowledge.
- Oh, no.

1036
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:56,698
Exactly the same murder method
is employed...

1037
01:11:56,878 --> 01:11:59,962
...in the play we open with on Monday,
<i>Out of the Stew Pot.</i>

1038
01:12:00,632 --> 01:12:03,882
- Any in the company could've done it?
- Right.

1039
01:12:04,052 --> 01:12:07,966
The way things are now, I am tempted,
sorely tempted, to arrest the whole lot.

1040
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:09,799
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1041
01:12:09,974 --> 01:12:12,548
What you've found out,
what we've found out...

1042
01:12:12,727 --> 01:12:13,972
Look at what we've got.

1043
01:12:14,145 --> 01:12:16,304
Cosgood, he told you
he'd only just written...

1044
01:12:16,481 --> 01:12:18,390
...this confounded
<i>Remember September...</i>

1045
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:21,104
...and yet we know
it was produced in 1951.

1046
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:23,815
And victim number one, Mrs. McGinty,
was in it.

1047
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,649
And this fellow Summers,
we know he took Mrs. McGinty out...

1048
01:12:27,825 --> 01:12:30,281
...two times the week
the company was in Milchester...

1049
01:12:30,453 --> 01:12:32,909
...the week she was murdered.
- And his wife, Maureen...

1050
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,287
...she knew about this,
and she didn't like it.

1051
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:38,412
Then there's this spooky girl Eva.
We've been able to establish...

1052
01:12:38,586 --> 01:12:41,373
...that she was having a romance
with George Rowton...

1053
01:12:41,548 --> 01:12:44,548
...and that he tossed her aside like a...
- Worn-out glove, sir?

1054
01:12:44,717 --> 01:12:47,006
Yes. And then there's young Arthur.

1055
01:12:47,178 --> 01:12:50,013
That note you found in your room was
typed on his typewriter...

1056
01:12:50,181 --> 01:12:53,182
...and as a result of the assignation,
victim number three.

1057
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,887
There is a point here.

1058
01:12:56,062 --> 01:12:58,683
In 1951, the younger members
of the company...

1059
01:12:58,856 --> 01:13:01,145
...would have been mere children.
- Yes.

1060
01:13:01,609 --> 01:13:05,441
Yes, by George. If that performance of
<i>Remember September</i> in 1951...

1061
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:08,863
...13 years ago, started this whole thing,
then none of the youngsters...

1062
01:13:09,033 --> 01:13:11,987
...Eva, Bill, Sheila, Arthur,
can have had anything to do with it.

1063
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:14,534
Oh, it seems so.
I mean, anyone could've...

1064
01:13:14,706 --> 01:13:16,283
...gone into Arthur's room...

1065
01:13:16,457 --> 01:13:19,708
...and used the typewriter. I did myself.

1066
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:23,123
- He's here, sir.
- What?

1067
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:26,548
- He's here, sir.
- Yes. Would you wait here a moment...

1068
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,426
...please, Miss Marple?
- Wait?

1069
01:13:28,595 --> 01:13:30,718
Please. Sergeant.

1070
01:13:39,147 --> 01:13:42,397
I wonder why the iron was hot.

1071
01:13:43,735 --> 01:13:46,404
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I...

1072
01:13:46,571 --> 01:13:49,192
You asked me to drop in the
cast list when I was passing.

1073
01:13:49,365 --> 01:13:51,239
You <i>know, Remember September.</i>

1074
01:13:51,409 --> 01:13:54,244
And you were passing at 2:30
in the morning?

1075
01:13:54,412 --> 01:13:56,286
- Come, now.
- Yes, well...

1076
01:13:56,581 --> 01:14:00,531
Well, as a matter of fact, the inspector
was kind enough to send a car.

1077
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:04,293
He thought I might succeed
where he had failed to persuade you...

1078
01:14:04,464 --> 01:14:06,041
To desert my post, perhaps?

1079
01:14:06,216 --> 01:14:09,216
This is a dangerous place.
These are dangerous people.

1080
01:14:09,385 --> 01:14:11,129
- Only one of them.
- Miss Marple.

1081
01:14:11,304 --> 01:14:15,218
- The time has come for plain speak...
- Please, Jim, I'm thinking.

1082
01:14:15,391 --> 01:14:18,345
It's here that the answer lies.

1083
01:14:19,229 --> 01:14:23,475
"Driffold Cosgood, Ralph Summers,
Margaret McGinty, Rose Kane"...

1084
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,692
Rose.

1085
01:14:26,236 --> 01:14:27,278
Rose.

1086
01:14:27,654 --> 01:14:30,773
Mr. Stringer, we have here, in addition...

1087
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:34,448
...to Margaret McGinty,
an actress called Rose Kane.

1088
01:14:35,078 --> 01:14:36,951
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand.

1089
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,455
Don't you see? Rose.
A rose by any other name would smell.

1090
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:42,000
The blackmail note.

1091
01:14:43,086 --> 01:14:47,629
Mr. Stringer, tomorrow I must do
some digging.

1092
01:14:47,799 --> 01:14:50,835
- Digging?
- Yes, into the past.

1093
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:08,108
You mean this Rose Kane?

1094
01:15:09,487 --> 01:15:10,530
Yes.

1095
01:15:10,697 --> 01:15:14,148
You seem to remember her well,
Mr. Tumbrill.

1096
01:15:14,325 --> 01:15:15,985
What is your interest in her?

1097
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,820
Oh, I simply want to trace her.

1098
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:21,447
You see, I've been outside the profession
for a number of years now.

1099
01:15:21,624 --> 01:15:23,498
- And so the only way l...
- Well...

1100
01:15:23,668 --> 01:15:27,535
...if you're an old friend of hers,
I'm afraid you're in for a bit of a shock.

1101
01:15:28,506 --> 01:15:31,128
- Poor Rosie was hanged, you know.
- What?

1102
01:15:31,301 --> 01:15:34,218
Yes. Terrible business.

1103
01:15:34,637 --> 01:15:37,342
Terrible business. Will you?

1104
01:15:37,515 --> 01:15:40,350
Not so soon after breakfast, thank you.

1105
01:15:40,518 --> 01:15:43,140
- You were saying?
- Oh, yes, terrible.

1106
01:15:43,313 --> 01:15:44,973
I shall never forget it.

1107
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:47,686
She opened in this play
somewhere in the sticks.

1108
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,686
A unique flopperoo, by the way.

1109
01:15:49,861 --> 01:15:51,735
Didn't even run the night.

1110
01:15:51,905 --> 01:15:54,574
Anyhow, the same night,
believe it or not...

1111
01:15:54,741 --> 01:15:56,698
...she poisoned her husband.

1112
01:15:56,868 --> 01:15:59,573
- Did she indeed?
- Yes, she did.

1113
01:16:00,038 --> 01:16:03,905
She sent her kid out to buy
half a pound of garlic sausage...

1114
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:06,954
...and then doctored it with weed killer.

1115
01:16:07,253 --> 01:16:08,712
There was a child?

1116
01:16:09,714 --> 01:16:11,541
Must have been 10 or 11 at the time.

1117
01:16:11,716 --> 01:16:14,670
- Boy or girl?
- Never saw the kid myself.

1118
01:16:14,844 --> 01:16:16,718
Can't even remember its name.

1119
01:16:16,971 --> 01:16:20,056
Anyway, I did hear that some friend
took it in for a bit afterwards...

1120
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:22,466
...then popped it into an orphanage.

1121
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:25,016
That friend, was her name McGinty?

1122
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:28,555
Yes, that's right. Maggie McGinty.

1123
01:16:28,733 --> 01:16:30,524
Blond, flighty piece.

1124
01:16:31,736 --> 01:16:33,729
Why ever did Rose do it, Mr. Tumbrill?

1125
01:16:33,905 --> 01:16:35,732
Usual thing. Another man.

1126
01:16:35,907 --> 01:16:38,742
- And who was he?
- He never came forward.

1127
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,108
And she never named him.

1128
01:16:41,996 --> 01:16:43,870
Then it could be the lover...

1129
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,238
...or the child.

1130
01:16:48,419 --> 01:16:51,207
I wonder if I might have this
photograph, Mr. Tumbrill.

1131
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:53,587
- As a keepsake.
- Oh, by all means.

1132
01:16:53,758 --> 01:16:56,296
- Thank you.
- Yes, by all means.

1133
01:16:57,971 --> 01:17:00,758
One of mine that got away,
you might say.

1134
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:03,174
Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.

1135
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:04,976
Allow me.

1136
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:10,060
- Evelyn!
- I beg your pardon?

1137
01:17:10,233 --> 01:17:13,768
Rose's kid. Evelyn, that was the name.

1138
01:17:14,696 --> 01:17:16,155
Evelyn.

1139
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:33,963
Nothing like champagne
for a champagne occasion.

1140
01:17:34,132 --> 01:17:37,667
- Uncommonly civil of you, dear lady.
- What about a toast, dear boy?

1141
01:17:37,844 --> 01:17:39,846
- Something appropriate?
- Of course, of course.

1142
01:17:40,013 --> 01:17:43,049
To success. To us. All of us.

1143
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:45,431
And particularly to our hostess.

1144
01:17:45,602 --> 01:17:47,262
- Long life, dear lady.
- Thank you.

1145
01:17:47,437 --> 01:17:49,264
- Long life.
- Hear, hear.

1146
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:53,733
Oh, Mr. Cosgood. Such lovely flowers.

1147
01:17:57,447 --> 01:17:59,741
Who's that?

1148
01:18:00,033 --> 01:18:01,741
Oh, she was an actress.

1149
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:05,658
Called Rose Kane. Why do you ask?

1150
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:08,323
I don't know.

1151
01:18:08,499 --> 01:18:11,417
But somehow she means death.

1152
01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:14,494
Something to do with George.

1153
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,846
Five minutes, boys and girls.
Come on, come on, the party's over.

1154
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:28,100
Now, remember, all you have to do
is speak your lines clearly...

1155
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:30,143
...try not to trip over the furniture...

1156
01:18:30,313 --> 01:18:32,389
...and we'll run longer
than <i>The Mousetrap.</i>

1157
01:18:32,565 --> 01:18:34,273
See you on-stage, dear lady.

1158
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:39,319
Oh, and don't forget,
it's Rona La Plante who's dead.

1159
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:43,232
Well, Driffold. Tonight's the night.

1160
01:18:43,409 --> 01:18:44,987
It most certainly is.

1161
01:18:45,161 --> 01:18:47,367
- Got the gun?
- Yes.

1162
01:18:56,005 --> 01:18:58,461
What do you suppose she wants
to see us about, sir?

1163
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:01,385
I don't know, sergeant,
but she's up to something.

1164
01:19:01,928 --> 01:19:03,596
Come in.

1165
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:07,219
Well, Miss Marple?

1166
01:19:07,392 --> 01:19:09,265
Good evening, inspector.

1167
01:19:09,435 --> 01:19:11,393
I think there's something
you should know...

1168
01:19:11,563 --> 01:19:15,430
...before you go in to see the play.
- Oh, what?

1169
01:19:15,775 --> 01:19:17,649
I think our murderer...

1170
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:20,524
...will try to kill me again tonight.

1171
01:19:20,697 --> 01:19:21,948
Again?

1172
01:19:22,824 --> 01:19:25,445
The first attempt failed.

1173
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:28,619
Poor Dorothy perished instead.

1174
01:19:28,788 --> 01:19:30,864
What are you talking about?

1175
01:19:31,749 --> 01:19:34,038
The iron was hot, you see.

1176
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:37,662
- I burnt my hand.
- No, I don't see.

1177
01:19:39,424 --> 01:19:42,175
When I went into Dorothy's room
earlier that night...

1178
01:19:42,343 --> 01:19:44,336
...there was washing on the line.
- Well?

1179
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:46,754
Well, I think she did her ironing later...

1180
01:19:46,931 --> 01:19:48,591
...and forgot to switch off.

1181
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,590
Then in the middle of the night,
she woke and remembered...

1182
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:53,727
...and went down to the kitchen
to do so.

1183
01:19:53,897 --> 01:19:56,648
- And walked into a trap for you.
- Quite.

1184
01:19:57,108 --> 01:20:00,726
That note was left outside
my door deliberately...

1185
01:20:00,904 --> 01:20:02,564
...to lure me down.

1186
01:20:02,947 --> 01:20:05,569
Right, sergeant. We're going to stay
right here...

1187
01:20:05,742 --> 01:20:08,411
...and we're not going to let
Miss Marple out of our sight.

1188
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:10,286
Oh, you mustn't do that, inspector.

1189
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:12,328
We must put no obstacle in the way.

1190
01:20:13,249 --> 01:20:14,578
You can't be serious.

1191
01:20:14,751 --> 01:20:16,375
Never more so.

1192
01:20:16,544 --> 01:20:19,794
You see, our murderer
set a trap for me.

1193
01:20:19,964 --> 01:20:23,333
I have just returned the compliment.

1194
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:26,511
Miss Marple, I've brought the...

1195
01:20:26,679 --> 01:20:29,301
Let me have it, Mr. Stringer.

1196
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:32,799
- Thank you.
- Wait a minute. What's going on?

1197
01:20:33,519 --> 01:20:36,271
Life insurance, inspector.

1198
01:20:36,439 --> 01:20:38,147
Life insurance.

1199
01:20:38,316 --> 01:20:41,233
<i>Beginners on-stage, please.</i>
<i>Beginners on-stage.</i>

1200
01:20:41,402 --> 01:20:43,893
Will you please excuse me, gentlemen?

1201
01:21:20,066 --> 01:21:22,522
Father, we've been
all through that before.

1202
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:26,738
You know that I have committed myself
to this way of life...

1203
01:21:26,906 --> 01:21:28,698
...and I won't give it up.

1204
01:21:34,414 --> 01:21:36,620
You're living here?

1205
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:38,202
A son of mine?

1206
01:21:38,376 --> 01:21:40,369
I live where I choose.

1207
01:22:04,235 --> 01:22:05,729
Come in, Eva.

1208
01:22:15,788 --> 01:22:18,326
Now, don't scream.

1209
01:22:18,499 --> 01:22:20,457
Don't even speak.

1210
01:22:20,627 --> 01:22:23,414
Because I'm taking you somewhere
where we won't be interrupted.

1211
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:25,583
And if you do anything...

1212
01:22:25,757 --> 01:22:27,381
...I'll kill you.

1213
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:30,920
Now, open that door.

1214
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:38,720
A couple of years in jail, what's that?

1215
01:22:38,895 --> 01:22:42,727
Why, it might be the making of you.

1216
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:45,568
You may think the police are fools,
Stanley.

1217
01:22:45,735 --> 01:22:49,104
Perhaps some of them are.
But not all, son.

1218
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,940
Not all.

1219
01:22:52,283 --> 01:22:54,953
Right here. Now, if anyone
tries to come through here...

1220
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:57,575
...I want to know who it is
and what he wants. Got that?

1221
01:22:57,747 --> 01:22:59,407
Very good, sir.

1222
01:22:59,582 --> 01:23:01,741
Hey, what's all this about?

1223
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:06,042
Well, Miss Marple, I've covered every...

1224
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:10,341
- Sergeant!
- Sheila...

1225
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:12,253
...have you seen Ralph?
- No.

1226
01:23:12,428 --> 01:23:14,468
You've got to tell the police
all you know...

1227
01:23:15,139 --> 01:23:17,141
- Where is she?
- She hasn't left her room, sir.

1228
01:23:17,308 --> 01:23:20,095
She has, you idiot. We've got
to find her. You take that side.

1229
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,725
Look, Dad, can't we cut this short?

1230
01:23:22,939 --> 01:23:25,809
I'm expecting a visitor in a...

1231
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:29,569
In a few moments.

1232
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:35,867
One of you... One of your
worthless friends, no doubt.

1233
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:39,198
It's the girl I'm going to marry,
if you must know.

1234
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,207
Look at me.

1235
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:47,081
Look at me!

1236
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,797
What's the matter with you?

1237
01:23:53,803 --> 01:23:57,338
I want you to know
why you're going to die.

1238
01:23:57,682 --> 01:24:00,351
I want to know that too.

1239
01:24:00,518 --> 01:24:02,345
You killed him.

1240
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,560
I don't know why, but you killed him.

1241
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:07,810
By "him," you mean George Rowton,
don't you?

1242
01:24:08,192 --> 01:24:09,235
Yes.

1243
01:24:09,986 --> 01:24:11,528
You were in love with him.

1244
01:24:11,696 --> 01:24:13,190
Yes, I loved him.

1245
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:14,609
And you killed him.

1246
01:24:15,325 --> 01:24:18,195
Oh, no, you're mistaken, my dear.

1247
01:24:18,369 --> 01:24:21,655
He was killed by someone
called Evelyn Kane.

1248
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:25,413
I don't believe you.

1249
01:24:25,585 --> 01:24:27,577
I know it was you.

1250
01:24:27,754 --> 01:24:31,253
- I've felt it was you from the beginning.
- You can't do it, Eva.

1251
01:24:31,424 --> 01:24:34,378
You're no more capable of murder
than I am.

1252
01:24:54,405 --> 01:24:56,065
You were quite right.

1253
01:24:56,241 --> 01:24:58,280
She couldn't have done it.

1254
01:24:58,576 --> 01:25:00,036
A pity.

1255
01:25:00,411 --> 01:25:03,246
I thought she might have saved me
the trouble.

1256
01:25:03,414 --> 01:25:07,079
- Aren't you supposed to be on the stage?
- Oh, but I am, Miss Marple.

1257
01:25:07,585 --> 01:25:10,255
And what's more,
hundreds of people will swear I am...

1258
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:13,212
...hiding behind the curtain.

1259
01:25:13,758 --> 01:25:15,383
It's very simple, really.

1260
01:25:15,552 --> 01:25:19,419
You remember when that idiot Cosgood
dropped through the trap?

1261
01:25:20,306 --> 01:25:22,215
Well, I've done the same.

1262
01:25:22,392 --> 01:25:24,301
In exactly three minutes...

1263
01:25:24,477 --> 01:25:27,098
...I shall be back on-stage, on cue.

1264
01:25:28,731 --> 01:25:30,356
But you, I'm sorry to say...

1265
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:32,482
...will not be answering yours.

1266
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,945
You're Evelyn Kane, aren't you?

1267
01:25:36,614 --> 01:25:38,322
Rose Kane's son.

1268
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:40,159
Oh, yes.

1269
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:43,116
Evelyn, what a name.

1270
01:25:43,288 --> 01:25:44,568
I soon changed that.

1271
01:25:44,956 --> 01:25:47,447
Yes, the McGinty woman
found that out, didn't she...

1272
01:25:47,834 --> 01:25:49,826
...when you were playing in Milchester.

1273
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:53,621
She recognized you, and as you were
marrying an heiress...

1274
01:25:53,798 --> 01:25:56,087
...she saw an opportunity for blackmail.

1275
01:25:56,259 --> 01:25:58,086
She threatened to tell Sheila's father...

1276
01:25:58,261 --> 01:26:00,716
...unless I paid her to keep quiet.

1277
01:26:03,057 --> 01:26:04,433
So I kept her quiet.

1278
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:08,185
Where could I find the money
she wanted?

1279
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,728
- George Rowton.
- She wanted L100.

1280
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:15,985
So I forged George's name on a check.

1281
01:26:16,863 --> 01:26:19,532
Well, I couldn't let him find that out,
now, could I?

1282
01:26:20,533 --> 01:26:22,775
So they both had to die, didn't they?

1283
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:26,660
Poor old Dorothy.

1284
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:31,168
That was meant for you, of course.

1285
01:26:45,558 --> 01:26:47,385
Well, I had meant to wring your neck...

1286
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,312
...but Eva's been very obliging.

1287
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:53,019
Her fingerprints are on that.

1288
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:55,563
And I'm on the stage.

1289
01:26:55,735 --> 01:26:56,778
Wait!

1290
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:02,359
I took the liberty of borrowing
this from Mr. Summers.

1291
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:06,033
You don't think you can fool me
with a prop gun filled with blanks.

1292
01:27:06,204 --> 01:27:07,995
Oh, no, not blanks.

1293
01:27:08,164 --> 01:27:10,869
A friend of mine
procured me some insurance.

1294
01:27:12,377 --> 01:27:15,294
- I'll risk it.
- I should warn you...

1295
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:20,042
...I won the Ladies' Small Arms
Championship at Bisley in 1924.

1296
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:22,544
Bully for you.

1297
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:36,097
Oh, dear.

1298
01:27:37,735 --> 01:27:40,191
I thought I heard something.

1299
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:44,533
Come out of there!

1300
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:49,865
Bill, you stupid...

1301
01:27:50,081 --> 01:27:51,659
Inspector.

1302
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:55,628
Oh, dear.

1303
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:01,250
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

1304
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:13,935
With a bit of rest and some luck,
the doctor thinks...

1305
01:28:14,105 --> 01:28:17,106
...I should be out of here in a few days.
- Oh, splendid.

1306
01:28:17,275 --> 01:28:20,644
I'm thankful the blow caused
no permanent damage.

1307
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,109
And now, if you'll excuse me.

1308
01:28:23,281 --> 01:28:26,484
Thank you very much, Miss Marple.
Oh, Miss Marple, there is one thing.

1309
01:28:26,659 --> 01:28:30,324
I thought you might like to know
that as a result of my work...

1310
01:28:30,496 --> 01:28:34,031
...on this case, I'm to be promoted.
Chief inspector.

1311
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:37,122
Oh, I'm so glad. Congratulations.

1312
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:39,129
Yes, well...

1313
01:28:39,297 --> 01:28:42,168
- Thank you, Miss Marple.
- Not at all, inspector.

1314
01:28:42,342 --> 01:28:44,465
Chief inspector.

1315
01:28:45,345 --> 01:28:47,752
<i>Well, au revoir.</i>

1316
01:28:52,143 --> 01:28:54,634
Forgive me if I fail to rise, dear lady.

1317
01:28:54,812 --> 01:28:57,220
I quite understand, Mr. Cosgood.

1318
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:59,308
I've brought you
some magazines to help...

1319
01:28:59,484 --> 01:29:01,026
...while away the time.

1320
01:29:01,194 --> 01:29:03,685
Yes, time. Time.

1321
01:29:03,863 --> 01:29:07,315
I've been lying here
contemplating a bleak future.

1322
01:29:07,492 --> 01:29:09,817
- Unless...
- Unless?

1323
01:29:09,994 --> 01:29:12,664
Well, I wondered if you'd
given any thought to my play...

1324
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:14,325
<i>... Remember September.</i>

1325
01:29:14,499 --> 01:29:16,741
It has been rather on my mind.

1326
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:19,587
Dear lady, I have a small confession
to make.

1327
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,794
It was I who left
the script in your room.

1328
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:25,211
- Really?
- Yes, I hoped it might make some...

1329
01:29:25,385 --> 01:29:27,840
...impression upon you.
- It did.

1330
01:29:28,012 --> 01:29:32,721
Good. You see, it seems to me that
with one or two minor alterations...

1331
01:29:32,892 --> 01:29:35,929
...in the second act, I have here
a very valuable property.

1332
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,180
I'm so happy for you, Mr. Cosgood.

1333
01:29:38,356 --> 01:29:40,764
There is, however,
one tiny, weeny little snag.

1334
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,895
Yes. It's sordid, of course,
when dealing with the arts...

1335
01:29:46,072 --> 01:29:48,990
...but a play, whatever its merits,
requires...

1336
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:51,828
...a backer.
- Mr. Cosgood...

1337
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:54,367
...whatever I may or may not be...

1338
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:57,291
...I am definitely no angel.

1339
01:29:58,001 --> 01:29:59,376
Goodbye...

1340
01:29:59,544 --> 01:30:01,501
...and good luck.

1341
01:30:30,909 --> 01:30:32,985
