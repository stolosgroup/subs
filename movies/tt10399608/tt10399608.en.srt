PIGGY

4
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,673
I told you I'm not going
straight out to the festivities.

5
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:22,142
Maca, come on. Pretty please.

6
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,311
We'll swing by the
house to get dressed.

7
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,614
- Roci!
- Quit it.

8
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,750
Shall we go to the
waterfall, Clau?

9
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,183
You guys decide.

10
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,620
Okay, then. Let's
see what my mom says.

11
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:36,189
- YOLO, girl. YOLO.
- All fucking set then.

12
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,925
Let's get some beer
and food and go.

13
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,028
Go ahead. I have to
go to the butcher's.

14
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,931
- Wait, you shop there?
- They're expensive.

15
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,198
Go to the supermarket.

16
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,702
My mom placed an order.
We'll meet at the waterfall.

17
00:02:47,869 --> 00:02:50,738
- I'll come with you.
- Nah, it's all right.

18
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:53,173
Come on, it'll be a laugh.

19
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,641
Come on!

20
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,781
Hey, blondie. Your
order's almost ready.

21
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:00,914
Thanks.

22
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:05,205
Where have
you been this summer?

23
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,554
We've barely seen you.

24
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:09,488
Hi.

25
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:10,757
Hi.

26
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:16,631
Want some rabbit? It's
on offer. Sara shot them.

27
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,866
No, thanks.

28
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,637
So, tonight
you're heading

29
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,304
to the Madrigal
festivities, right?

30
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,741
What about you, child?

31
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,843
Are you tagging along with Clau?

32
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,043
I have to study.

33
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:32,312
Study? Kids
have to have fun!

34
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,348
- Right? Ask Mom.
- Ask me what?

35
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,484
She wants to
go out and party.

36
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:39,654
If she's finished studying...

37
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,297
Fancy homemade blood sausage?

38
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,467
- No, thanks.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

39
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:03,611
Bye.

40
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:04,945
- Bye.
- Bye.

41
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,648
Come on, tidy this
up. I'll make lunch.

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,720
Get moving, child.
Didn't you hear Mom?

43
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:15,388
Come on, move it.

44
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,908
#THETHREELITTLEPIGS
MACA: FUCKING FATSO

45
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:58,398
- You animal!
- You're a goner if Mom sees you.

46
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,548
Watch it!

47
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,051
The things I put up with.

48
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,022
Excuse me, do I know you?

49
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,959
All right then.

50
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,400
What are you looking at, clown?

51
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,435
<i>In yesterday's
running of the bulls</i>

52
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,646
<i>in Madrigal de la Vera,</i>

53
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,581
<i>a young bull escaped
the bullring,</i>

54
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,783
<i>causing chaos and
charging a resident.</i>

55
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,385
<i>The young bull's escape
caused great commotion</i>

56
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,519
<i>among the attendees,</i>

57
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,290
<i>who watched as it jumped
over the protective fences</i>

58
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,158
<i>and ran out. The
Guardia Civil...</i>

59
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:34,595
Put your phone down
while we eat. Enough already.

60
00:06:35,363 --> 00:06:36,964
Same thing every year.

61
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,136
It's no joke. Remember when
one got into Luciana's house.

62
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,438
Remember?

63
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,775
Sara, your hair, please.

64
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:53,514
What's wrong? Not hungry?

65
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,317
<i>Bull runner since 14.
I've been waiting a year</i>

66
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,853
<i>for this town's run
and it's exciting.</i>

67
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,855
<i>As they say, you have
to experience this</i>

68
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,690
<i>and learn it since you're a kid.</i>

69
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:06,027
You could go hunting
with Dad tomorrow.

70
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:10,731
Child, I'm talking to you.

71
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:13,034
<i>Facing a
bull feels incredible.</i>

72
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:14,535
What do you say, Dad?

73
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,169
- Dad!
- What?

74
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:18,873
- Hunting, tomorrow. With her.
- If she wants to.

75
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,276
It's not about if she wants
to, she needs to go out

76
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,778
and get some fresh air.

77
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,347
But you have to
get up early, Sara.

78
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,149
Otherwise, it's a waste of time.

79
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:29,983
Whatever.

80
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,586
She doesn't even want to
go hunting now. What next?

81
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,123
- Don't say you don't go out.
- Well, it's up to her.

82
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,527
- Why can't I come?
- Not you, rugrat.

83
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,996
Switch it to the soap opera!

84
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:45,566
It's started.

85
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:49,136
<i>Do you need something
or are you just pestering us?</i>

86
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,727
EVERYTHING FOR THE MOTHERLAND

87
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,137
Are you going
to hook up with Pedro?

88
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,140
- Maybe.
- You're so cheeky.

89
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:09,076
Look, Clau, your friend.
Aren't you going to say hi?

90
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:10,678
I'll say hi.

91
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,986
Come on, Maca,
let's get dressed.

92
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:24,291
Piggy! Have you missed me?

93
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,460
What are you doing
here all alone, Piggy?

94
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,998
She's not alone. Can't you
see she's got a boyfriend?

95
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:35,570
No! No, Piggy, no. You got a
boyfriend and didn't tell me?

96
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,805
I thought we were
friends, Piggy.

97
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,574
Nobody wants to be with you.

98
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,642
Did you give him
ham for him to love you?

99
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,776
Or was it pork belly?

100
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,278
How do you talk?

101
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,713
Oink, oink, oink?

102
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:49,783
Like this?

103
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,286
Check out her bikini.
Her body just swallows it.

104
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,688
- Totally.
- Quiet, quiet.

105
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,657
Why don't you say
something? Huh?

106
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,927
Oh, that's great. Eat
your hair. Eat it!

107
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,195
Tasty hair!

108
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,198
Yes, it tastes like
bacon, like fat,

109
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,700
like pork belly. Full of fat.

110
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,469
It's what you like.

111
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,338
How tasty! You're so lucky that
you can eat your hair's fat.

112
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:16,110
Why are you smiling?
Are you laughing at me?

113
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:19,013
She's so disgusting.
Look at her.

114
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,384
Leave some water
for us. You pig!

115
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:35,597
Piggy! Look, he's leaving.
You'll lose your boar.

116
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,400
Your boyfriend's leaving. Oh,
darling, you're all alone now.

117
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:42,870
You've scored
at last, Piggy.

118
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:50,878
Girl, come here.

119
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:52,946
Come on!

120
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,685
What's your deal?

121
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,753
Let's
catch the pig-whale.

122
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:17,004
Let's catch the pig-whale.

123
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,609
Maca, Maca,
you're going too far.

124
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,310
- Seriously?
- Maca, come on, quit it.

125
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,546
I'm just kidding.

126
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:26,514
Help!

127
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,215
You're playing
along, right?

128
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:32,019
You have quite the rubber ring
there, you're not going to sink!

129
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:34,822
Stay still, Piggy.
You're going to break it.

130
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,357
We're just playing, right?

131
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,292
Just play with me then!

132
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,425
What a stupid girl.

133
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:40,928
Help! Claudia!

134
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,999
Help? Claudia, she's asking
for help. Help your friend.

135
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,934
Help her. Yeah?

136
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,937
- Are you a pig like your friend?
- Claudia.

137
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,240
Piggy, smile!

138
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,578
You look amazing.

139
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,546
You'll break it, Piggy.

140
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,426
- Isn't her backpack cute?
- Yes.

141
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,034
Let's go.

142
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:27,374
No! Claudia! No!

143
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:29,909
Let's go, Clau.

144
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:32,079
- Hurry up.
- Grab her towel.

145
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,049
No!

146
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:37,851
No!

147
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,958
Miss Bacon!
Come on, Miss Bacon!

148
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:54,863
Come on! Oh, fatty!

149
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,264
- Bacon!
- Come on, dude.

150
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,867
Run her over!

151
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,168
She's going
to sink the bridge!

152
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,070
Run over her!

153
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,405
Come on, bacon!

154
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,984
No! No!

155
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,789
No! No!

156
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,956
Relax, Miss Bacon.

157
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,660
- Go for it, dude.
- No! No!

158
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:37,104
- Gross! Fatso!
- Bye, Miss Bacon!

159
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:41,141
Such a cute little
piggy!

160
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,588
Sara, please!

161
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,692
Sara!

162
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:14,394
Sara, help me! Sara!

163
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:18,332
Sara, help me, please.

164
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,569
Sara!

165
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,371
Sara, help me! Sara!

166
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,841
Sara, help me, please!

167
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:28,543
Sara!

168
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:38,720
Sara! Sara.

169
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,792
Sara, please.

170
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:49,262
Sara! Sara!

171
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:57,304
Sara! Sara! Sara!
Sara! No, no, no! No!

172
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,207
Sara! Sara!

173
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:01,843
Sara!

174
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,313
No!

175
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,512
EVERYTHING FOR THE MOTHERLAND

176
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,750
Chill out!

177
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:45,787
You okay, kid?

178
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:51,552
Sara!

179
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:54,922
Are you deaf, huh?

180
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,158
Look at you.

181
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:01,028
You're burned to a crisp,
you're going to peel red raw!

182
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:04,966
Put some aftersun on!
Honestly, you're so foolish.

183
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,602
You've been at the pool, right?

184
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,370
Of course, instead of studying.

185
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,340
What's wrong with you?

186
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:18,012
Get out and head to the shop!
Stop wasting time. Come on!

187
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:21,849
Come on!

188
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:27,955
This child, honestly...

189
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,517
Aftersun lotion!

190
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,980
THREE LITTLE PIGS

191
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:45,833
Fuck them.

192
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,866
BACKPACK

193
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,466
May I leave?

194
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,905
Now, child? You've not
lifted a finger yet.

195
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:26,107
If Mom finds out...

196
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:11,018
The light's burnt out. Go on.

197
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,021
Go to the shop.
I'll note it down.

198
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:17,191
- I have to study.
- Not that story...

199
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:19,760
What if someone comes in?

200
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:22,530
Who? Nobody's been
in all afternoon.

201
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:25,866
Here.

202
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,106
Grab me a cold cola, and
get yourself something.

203
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,644
Go on. Come on, Sara.

204
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:40,848
You're letting
the cold air out!

205
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:01,829
You can buy these, but
on your head be it.

206
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:06,100
Okay, I'll leave it.

207
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:28,389
Girl, what happened?

208
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,257
At the pool,
something happened.

209
00:26:31,425 --> 00:26:32,736
What are
you talking about?

210
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:39,333
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you pick up?

211
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,969
Dad sent me to get a light bulb.

212
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:43,103
Right.

213
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:45,973
Something happened at the
pool. Do you know anything?

214
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:46,807
No.

215
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:48,776
- Let's head over there.
- Where?

216
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,078
Where else? To the pool.

217
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:52,880
But Dad asked me to...

218
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:55,416
When have you ever been
in a rush? Dad can wait.

219
00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:56,851
- Come on.
- No.

220
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:59,386
Don't you want to find
out what happened?

221
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,323
But I'm not wearing my swimsuit.

222
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:06,160
Why do you need one?
Oh, come on, child.

223
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:19,373
Oh, look at you
with that beautiful mouth.

224
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,846
What?

225
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,413
Nothing.

226
00:27:29,783 --> 00:27:31,852
It will be worse if
I find out later.

227
00:27:42,363 --> 00:27:43,731
Who was at the pool?

228
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,299
No one.

229
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,703
The lifeguard was there, right?

230
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:55,075
- No.
- And the waitress?

231
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:02,883
Child, honestly, I have
to pry things out of you.

232
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:26,774
- Mom, what's wrong?
- We'll find out now.

233
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:33,414
Can you get out, child? Come on!

234
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,486
Keep this under control. I don't
want the northerners butting in.

235
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:40,734
Can't someone else do this?

236
00:28:41,055 --> 00:28:42,655
It's the first time
something's happened.

237
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:44,258
Do what you're told.

238
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:47,529
We should take photos.
Murderers usually come back.

239
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:51,932
Photos? Of the old ladies?
Are you kidding me?

240
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:53,681
You can't pass, Asun.

241
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:55,111
You
can't pass, Asun.

242
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:56,937
- What happened?
- I can't say.

243
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:58,839
They found Rober
dead in the water.

244
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:00,116
- Luciana!
- And Rosa,

245
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,042
the waitress, is missing.

246
00:29:02,943 --> 00:29:05,412
Oh, my God. No, no...

247
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,115
- Move over.
- Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

248
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:10,351
How long has the
corpse been there?

249
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:11,919
Asun, let us do our job.

250
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,821
Tell her to leave,
I just got here.

251
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:15,356
Hey, I'm not interfering!

252
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:17,958
Bravo, girl!

253
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:20,394
There goes
the crime scene!

254
00:29:20,528 --> 00:29:24,031
See? I knew it. My daughter
bathed with the corpse.

255
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:27,468
- I never saw her near the pool.
- She came after lunch.

256
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:29,370
- After lunch?
- Yes.

257
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,006
Corporal, please come.

258
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,841
She's got stomach cramps.

259
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,943
- You have to wait two hours.
- At least.

260
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:38,012
- Mom, let's go.
- What's the fuss?

261
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:40,047
- Why are they still here?
- I want to know

262
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,750
how long the corpse
has been there.

263
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:44,218
She bathed there. She might
have caught something.

264
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:45,696
She was
here this afternoon,

265
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,289
I saw her coming back.
The dog went wild.

266
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:50,224
Every day. As
soon as it smells her.

267
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:52,459
Is that true? Were you
here in the afternoon?

268
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:55,730
She comes here every
day. She thinks I don't know.

269
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,931
Did you see or hear
anything strange?

270
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:03,270
Are you okay,
child? What's wrong?

271
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:04,672
I never...

272
00:30:05,272 --> 00:30:06,272
Louder, girl.

273
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,175
I never went to the pool.

274
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,746
What do you mean? You
got sunburnt like a fool.

275
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:15,015
I went to the river. As it's
shallow, I got sunburnt.

276
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:17,752
To the river? You
always go to the pool.

277
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:21,690
They call me "Piggy." That's why
I don't go. And you do nothing.

278
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:22,822
What?

279
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,029
- Sara, don't lie.
- It's true.

280
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,065
Asun, take
her home, will you?

281
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:33,967
- Don't waste our time.
- Enough, shut up.

282
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,870
- Clear this up at once.
- Dad...

283
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:42,009
- Sorry, Corporal, she...
- Don't make me repeat myself.

284
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:44,545
Yes, Sir!

285
00:30:46,514 --> 00:30:48,148
Come on, move it.

286
00:30:48,449 --> 00:30:50,851
Move it or I'll start
dishing out fines.

287
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:53,588
- She's actually quite fat.
- Come on, Luciana!

288
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:04,365
So, you were never at the pool?

289
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,432
Hmmm?

290
00:31:08,803 --> 00:31:10,037
And that I do nothing?

291
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:14,975
You'll see now. Wait and see.

292
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:20,782
Oh, take this. It'll
settle your stomach.

293
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,251
<i>No, we never knew!</i>

294
00:31:57,384 --> 00:32:00,154
<i>The last thing we expected
there was a dead guy.</i>

295
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:01,823
<i>The Civil Guard is looking</i>

296
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:03,825
<i>for the missing
girl's boyfriend.</i>

297
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,728
<i>Help from the public is
requested to find him.</i>

298
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,262
<i>To that end, several...</i>

299
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,964
Why don't they
use "Find My Phone"?

300
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,101
What's that, child?

301
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,570
An app.

302
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,372
If they have her
laptop, they'll find it.

303
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:19,949
With the town's
network coverage,

304
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,709
they'll never find him.

305
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:24,445
What is it now?

306
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:26,847
I'm hungry.

307
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:31,151
Don't they call you fat?
Eat less then. That's all.

308
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,759
Who calls you fat?

309
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,628
- Maca, Clau...
- Shut up!

310
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,396
Clau, the blonde girl?

311
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:46,300
- So two-faced.
- Does it matter who?

312
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:48,536
The town is full of spite.

313
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,271
The fact is she's fat
and has to lose weight.

314
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:54,074
You're also fat.

315
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,109
They don't call me pig.

316
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:00,815
From now on, salad and greens.

317
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,568
I don't want to hear
a peep out of you.

318
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:05,085
That's it.

319
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:10,692
- What did I do?
- Earned it.

320
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:14,127
<i>A crime
of passion at the hands</i>

321
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:18,198
<i>of the missing girl's partner.
Close sources indicate</i>

322
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:21,536
<i>that the woman may have
been in a relationship</i>

323
00:33:21,703 --> 00:33:22,703
<i>with the dead lifeguard.</i>

324
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:25,072
<i>This has been
absolutely horrible.</i>

325
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:26,725
<i>Nothing serious has
ever happened here.</i>

326
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:29,042
<i>At most, a fire. Not much else.</i>

327
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,253
Help!

328
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,254
- And this towel?
- From the market.

329
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:16,088
Hello?

330
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:18,234
The door's open
with a murderer in town?

331
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,661
Want us to die from heat?

332
00:34:19,794 --> 00:34:21,428
Besides, it was
Rosa's boyfriend.

333
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:22,262
Who is it?

334
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:23,989
- Damn.
- May I come in?

335
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:25,738
What are you
doing here, Elena?

336
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:32,372
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

337
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:37,045
I've been calling Sara
and she isn't picking up.

338
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:38,880
Where's
your phone, child?

339
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,247
Upstairs.

340
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:42,850
- Is that Sparky?
- Yes.

341
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,888
Oh, I didn't know.
My condolences.

342
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,790
What do you want with
my daughter, Elena?

343
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:50,625
You'll think I'm crazy,

344
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:52,994
but Claudia went out this
afternoon with Rocio,

345
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,261
Maca, and Pedro,

346
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:56,965
and she's not picking up.
And after the incident...

347
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,534
What does that have
to do with her, huh?

348
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,769
I don't know
who else to ask.

349
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:04,939
And since they were friends
and we live close by,

350
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,406
do you know anything?

351
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:07,785
They'll be
at the festivities.

352
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:11,846
So, you come to my home
to question my daughter?

353
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,413
Asun, I'm worried.

354
00:35:13,982 --> 00:35:15,016
Don't you understand...

355
00:35:15,182 --> 00:35:16,818
All I know is you have no shame.

356
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,720
- Excuse me?
- Your daughter,

357
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:24,124
Maca, and that slut Roci,
call my daughter a pig.

358
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:25,826
Pig.

359
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:27,962
They bully her.

360
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:30,832
And you have the balls
to come here and enquire?

361
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:32,600
My daughter doesn't
bully anyone.

362
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:36,336
Tomás, do you get me?

363
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:38,873
I really wouldn't know.

364
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,376
Sara, have you heard
anything? Talked to them?

365
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,946
Say something. I won't get
mad if she's with a boy.

366
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,322
- Kick her out.
- I'm eating.

367
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:48,415
- Please, tell me.
- Elena, please leave my house.

368
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:51,085
- Please.
- Get out of my house!

369
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:53,453
- Come on, get the fuck out!
- I'm leaving.

370
00:35:54,555 --> 00:35:55,555
Shameless!

371
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:00,094
She's one of the few
who still buys from us.

372
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:02,930
She's your daughter!
Besides, they don't buy much.

373
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,666
Stop hiccupping,

374
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:05,967
you look like a fool.

375
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,602
Boo!

376
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,573
You're driving me crazy.
You're all driving me crazy!

377
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:36,758
- I need the laptop.
- I'm using it.

378
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:39,259
Hand it over or I'll
tell Mom you watch porn.

379
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:40,804
I don't
care, you do the same.

380
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:41,596
Lies.

381
00:37:41,763 --> 00:37:43,631
I've seen
your browser history.

382
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:48,368
I need to find a phone with
that app you mentioned.

383
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:49,503
Go away,

384
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:51,806
you can't find Claudia
from our laptop.

385
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:55,342
You can only do that from
hers. Or from her tablet.

386
00:37:57,245 --> 00:37:59,412
Could I find my phone?

387
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:03,017
You lost your phone?
Mom's going to kill you.

388
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:06,087
I didn't lose it,
idiot... never mind.

389
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:07,622
You're the idiot.

390
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:29,977
<i>So, you made all
this selling pills and hash?</i>

391
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:35,750
<i>Don't say that I traffic
the Romanians' stuff again.</i>

392
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:39,586
<i>Moron.</i>

393
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:48,162
<i>Kid, will you stop fucking
around with the ball?</i>

394
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:49,931
<i>Come on, let's leave.</i>

395
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:51,799
<i>See you later, Ricky!</i>

396
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:55,736
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

397
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,004
What are you doing?

398
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,509
Scaring Dad.

399
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:04,451
There's a murderer on the loose

400
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:07,548
and you go around scaring
people? Unbelievable.

401
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:10,383
- This girl's a moron.
- Watch your mouth!

402
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:13,855
Do something useful,
child. Grab me a cold beer.

403
00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,058
<i>Oh,
look, it's your dad.</i>

404
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:26,901
Dad.

405
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:35,810
<i>That's my boy!</i>

406
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:06,774
Hey, where's Luciana?

407
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:08,542
Asleep in
front of the TV.

408
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:09,877
You know what she's like.

409
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:14,749
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

410
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:22,556
I don't get why we have to
look for the young bull.

411
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:26,661
Do you know the mess we're
in? Are you that thick?

412
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:29,330
Because we know the bloody area.

413
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,632
Who else would look
for it? The mayor?

414
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,169
Besides, the bull
should be close by.

415
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,404
Corporal,

416
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:39,307
Asun's daughter is lying.
We should interrogate her.

417
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:41,509
Are you going to shut
that mutt up or should I?

418
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,995
SARA DAUGHTER

419
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,961
Are you sure?

420
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:03,297
I don't know. It
said it was this way.

421
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,267
There's no signal now.

422
00:46:07,434 --> 00:46:08,713
Do you even know
how to use that?

423
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:09,937
Yes.

424
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,741
Fuck, this is in the
middle of nowhere.

425
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:14,275
I'm surprised it works.

426
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:18,412
- This town's network coverage...
- Do you girls come here often?

427
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,347
I don't know.

428
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:23,017
Perhaps they lost their phones.

429
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:24,218
All three of them?

430
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,186
We're blowing this
out of proportion.

431
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,758
My daughter doesn't go
missing out of the blue.

432
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:32,126
- What do you mean?
- They're being kids.

433
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,862
You convinced me not to
go to the Civil Guard

434
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:36,355
so as not to get
them into trouble.

435
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:37,437
They're probably partying.

436
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:40,467
That says my daughter is in
the middle of this forest.

437
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:43,937
I'm not backing out. I'll
go alone if I have to.

438
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:46,306
Let's go then.

439
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,611
Maca's going to be grounded
until the day she dies.

440
00:47:00,354 --> 00:47:01,355
It just moved!

441
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,924
- They are here!
- Thank goodness.

442
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,893
Wait until we get them...

443
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,562
- Which way?
- Which way?

444
00:47:07,696 --> 00:47:09,564
That way, but it's
disappeared again.

445
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:12,466
Come on, let's go. Claudia!

446
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,133
Roci!

447
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:15,537
Maca!

448
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:20,474
- Claudia!
- Maca!

449
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:44,631
Sara.

450
00:47:47,836 --> 00:47:51,338
Claudia! Where are you?

451
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:53,339
Roci!

452
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:55,376
Maca!

453
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:59,380
Claudia, please,
say something! Claudia!

454
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:05,018
Girls, it's
Amaya, where are you?

455
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:08,255
Maca, where are you?

456
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:12,025
Please, it's your mom!

457
00:48:13,595 --> 00:48:14,995
Roci! It's Dad!

458
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:18,332
Claudia!

459
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,569
Maca, can you hear me?

460
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:26,006
Roci!

461
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:32,446
Claudia!

462
00:48:34,415 --> 00:48:35,415
Claudia!

463
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:38,419
Where are you, Maca?

464
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:42,189
Roci! Roci!

465
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:45,292
Hello?

466
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:51,999
Claudia?

467
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:59,039
Maca!

468
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:08,683
Maca?

469
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,853
What? Is it moving?

470
00:49:12,186 --> 00:49:14,622
No. What if it's not them?

471
00:49:19,627 --> 00:49:23,063
She's dead! Dead!

472
00:49:23,865 --> 00:49:25,299
That's no young bull.

473
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:29,970
What have they done to her?

474
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:31,840
Call the Civil
Guard. Fuck, call!

475
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,675
My Claudia. Claudia!

476
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:37,177
Claudia. Claudia!

477
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:38,713
Help!

478
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:41,850
Please, help! Claudia!

479
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,461
- Where are you?
- Let's go!

480
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:46,621
Come on.

481
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:49,923
Claudia!

482
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:51,793
- Claudia!
- Come on!

483
00:49:51,926 --> 00:49:54,027
Claudia, come back!

484
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:57,364
- Claudia!
- Come on, Tarao!

485
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:00,434
Claudia!

486
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,471
Come back! Anyone there?

487
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:05,807
Stop!

488
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,374
- Stop!
- Come back, Tarao!

489
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:08,743
- Tarao, come back!
- Stop!

490
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:24,659
Easy, easy. Elena,
are you okay?

491
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:27,127
- Yes.
- What happened?

492
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:29,764
- My daughter...
- But are you okay?

493
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,966
I don't know where she is.

494
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,636
Relax, we'll look
for her now. Relax.

495
00:50:55,924 --> 00:50:58,258
Yes. I'll get it.

496
00:51:21,683 --> 00:51:25,285
It's on the floor.
You're losing your mind.

497
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:27,120
I swear I
looked everywhere!

498
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:29,289
Yet, I'm the one
who came downstairs.

499
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,673
What were you thinking?

500
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:22,744
What did you eat?

501
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,447
- A yoghurt.
- Sara...

502
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:32,620
Biscuits and chocolate.

503
00:52:34,856 --> 00:52:38,559
You're starting your diet
tomorrow. Stop messing around.

504
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:40,862
Go on, get upstairs.

505
00:52:46,034 --> 00:52:50,738
CRIME IN EXTREMADURA
LIFEGUARD FOUND DEAD

506
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:59,801
<i>Sara...</i>

507
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:48,549
I can't... my parents.

508
00:55:51,085 --> 00:55:56,123
Okay, I'm coming down.

509
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,744
- Hey.
- Hi.

510
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,880
Let's go.

511
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:24,151
Chill out, I don't bite.

512
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:39,100
Why did you lie?

513
00:56:40,635 --> 00:56:41,335
Huh?

514
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,055
Claudia sent a video
to our group chat.

515
00:56:43,304 --> 00:56:44,605
You were at the pool.

516
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:46,540
They're not answering
their texts.

517
00:56:47,108 --> 00:56:50,211
We were meant to go together,
but they were no-shows.

518
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:51,812
It doesn't add up.

519
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:54,047
What happened?

520
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,953
- Nothing.
- Bullshit, I saw the video.

521
00:57:00,154 --> 00:57:03,291
They picked on me.
They took my bag

522
00:57:03,758 --> 00:57:06,426
and I had to walk back
home in my swimsuit.

523
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:08,663
That's all?

524
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,935
So, you were all
at the pool, right?

525
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:15,869
Rober is dead.

526
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:19,040
Rosa, the waitress, is
missing. Something went on.

527
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:21,909
- I didn't see anything.
- Stop bullshitting.

528
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,145
They nearly drowned me.

529
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:26,681
Why did you lie then?

530
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:30,351
The police,
my mom were there.

531
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:31,552
What do I even say?

532
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:34,119
That they nearly drowned me?
That they nearly killed me?

533
00:57:56,577 --> 00:57:59,647
They pick on you, right?

534
00:58:01,983 --> 00:58:02,984
So do you.

535
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:05,886
No fucking way. Not like that.

536
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:10,057
- They sent you the video.
- I deleted it.

537
00:58:10,224 --> 00:58:11,392
Deleted the evidence.

538
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:13,728
Not true. I deleted
it out of pity.

539
00:58:17,398 --> 00:58:18,498
Pity?

540
00:58:22,036 --> 00:58:23,070
I'm so sorry.

541
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,253
First-timer, yeah?

542
00:58:39,987 --> 00:58:43,190
I can tell.

543
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:04,645
Let's go.

544
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:18,325
My mom.

545
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:21,996
Chill, chill.
Everything's fine.

546
00:59:27,668 --> 00:59:32,006
Come on. Seriously now, you
have to say you saw them.

547
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:34,642
What if something
happened to them?

548
00:59:41,182 --> 00:59:42,182
It would be of no use.

549
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:44,718
Of course it would.
They'll think it was me.

550
00:59:44,852 --> 00:59:47,188
It's always the same shit
in this fucking town.

551
00:59:47,354 --> 00:59:50,357
You won't believe the scene
Claudia's mom made at home.

552
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:51,659
As if I'd done something.

553
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:57,198
I can't get into any more
trouble. My dad will kill me.

554
00:59:58,332 --> 00:59:59,700
You don't know what he's like.

555
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:06,974
I can't.

556
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,779
- If they find out what I did...
- What did you do?

557
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:16,016
You did nothing. You just lied.
I can end up in jail, you know?

558
01:00:20,555 --> 01:00:24,658
If
something happens...

559
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:27,761
I mean, if you're accused...

560
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,832
I'll tell them about
the pool, okay?

561
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:33,933
Okay.

562
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:37,103
Thanks.

563
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:42,076
Anyway, they're probably
just partying, going wild.

564
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:45,278
Right?

565
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:54,755
Relax, it's okay.

566
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:07,902
What's this?

567
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:14,441
C.S.?

568
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:19,346
What the fuck?

569
01:01:20,214 --> 01:01:21,282
- Okay?
- You!

570
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:29,089
Where's Claudia? What
did you do to her?

571
01:01:29,223 --> 01:01:29,957
Nothing.

572
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,892
- Don't lie.
- Really.

573
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:33,894
The waitress was found dead.

574
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:38,132
Claudia's phone was nearby.
Please, what happened?

575
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:38,999
What happened?

576
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:41,335
I don't know.
I know nothing.

577
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:44,237
What do you know?

578
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:46,006
Elena, let the girl be.

579
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,610
She knows something.
What's she doing with him?

580
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:50,377
Leave her alone, Elena!

581
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:53,615
Your daughter knows something!
Tell her to talk. She knows!

582
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:54,747
Leave her alone.

583
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:55,916
They're up to something.

584
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:57,918
They've been up
and down all night.

585
01:01:58,052 --> 01:01:59,954
- Let's leave.
- No, she knows something.

586
01:02:00,087 --> 01:02:01,789
- Let go of her, Elena!
- Mom!

587
01:02:01,922 --> 01:02:03,891
- It was Sara.
- What?

588
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,459
What are you on about?

589
01:02:05,594 --> 01:02:07,895
Sara was last to see
them at the pool.

590
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,598
My daughter
wasn't at the pool.

591
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:10,730
She was, fuck!

592
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:13,067
Maca and Claudia tried to
drown her. It's filmed.

593
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,268
That's not true.

594
01:02:15,135 --> 01:02:15,836
Let's go.

595
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,805
What did you do to her? Tell me!

596
01:02:17,938 --> 01:02:20,609
- Let go of her, I'm warning you!
- Enough!

597
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:26,347
Mom, Mom!

598
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:36,257
Hey, quit it! Easy!

599
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:40,445
Listen, madam,
as soon as we have any news,

600
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:41,730
you'll be the first to know.

601
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:44,098
If something happens
to my daughter,

602
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:46,133
it'll be on your conscience.

603
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,135
Come on, Elena...

604
01:02:48,603 --> 01:02:50,938
Relax. Let them do their job.

605
01:02:51,171 --> 01:02:54,441
- It's my little girl, María.
- I know, I know.

606
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:57,211
Come on, let's go. Come on.

607
01:02:57,344 --> 01:03:00,247
Let them do their job. They
know what they're doing.

608
01:03:01,248 --> 01:03:02,316
Come on, relax.

609
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,353
- She's my little girl.
- I know.

610
01:03:06,487 --> 01:03:08,607
- It's my little girl.
- I know, I know.

611
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:10,457
Come on, darling, we're leaving.

612
01:03:11,225 --> 01:03:14,361
We're not accusing
you of anything, dear.

613
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:16,930
We just want you to
tell us what you know.

614
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:18,232
You understand, right?

615
01:03:18,365 --> 01:03:20,467
Caffeine for the
girl... at 3:00 a.m.?

616
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:21,636
It's what we have.

617
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,903
Come on, Asun. Let her be.

618
01:03:23,203 --> 01:03:26,006
You're keeping us here when
there's a murderer out there.

619
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,075
Wasn't the scene you
caused outside enough?

620
01:03:28,442 --> 01:03:30,120
You'll be lucky if she
doesn't press charges.

621
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:33,581
You want me to do nothing
while they mistreat my child?

622
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:35,583
Let's get down to business.

623
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:40,555
We just want to know what
happened at the pool.

624
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:43,625
- In your own words.
- And why did you lie?

625
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:46,126
My daughter never
lied. It was Pedro.

626
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:49,664
Corporal, kick Asun out. Can't
you see the girl's scared?

627
01:03:50,064 --> 01:03:52,433
She's a minor. Her
mother has to be present.

628
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:53,867
You heard.

629
01:03:57,971 --> 01:04:00,542
Juan Carlos, carry on.

630
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,456
What Pedro said is true, right?

631
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:20,060
You never went to
the river, right?

632
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:22,396
You were at the pool.

633
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:32,439
- Yes.
- For heaven's sake.

634
01:04:34,274 --> 01:04:35,274
What happened?

635
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,447
Roci...

636
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:45,318
Maca...

637
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:49,757
Clau...

638
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,062
they picked on me.

639
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:57,931
- They nearly drowned me.
- Cunts.

640
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:01,636
Asun! Carry on. Relax.

641
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:08,008
They took my clothes...

642
01:05:09,611 --> 01:05:10,612
my bag...

643
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,680
my towel...

644
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:19,386
and... I had to
walk back home...

645
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,088
near-naked.

646
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:23,525
And what did you do?

647
01:05:27,094 --> 01:05:28,195
Nothing.

648
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:32,399
Did you see Rober?
Rosa or her boyfriend?

649
01:05:33,635 --> 01:05:34,635
You saw nothing?

650
01:05:39,339 --> 01:05:42,943
I know about "the three little
pigs". I saw the hashtag.

651
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:45,679
Is that why you lied?

652
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:48,516
You didn't want to snitch?

653
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:55,288
I get it.

654
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:57,323
You know?

655
01:05:58,992 --> 01:06:00,194
But this is serious.

656
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:04,532
Your friend's phone
was near Rosa.

657
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:07,034
And Rosa's dead.

658
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:09,303
She's dead.

659
01:06:12,574 --> 01:06:13,741
Tell me the truth, Sara.

660
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:19,246
Help us.

661
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:27,522
- I...
- Enough!

662
01:06:28,255 --> 01:06:29,924
- We're leaving!
- Asun!

663
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:32,392
- Is she accused of anything?
- We're just talking.

664
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:33,327
Is she?

665
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,705
No,
Asun. She's not.

666
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:37,264
Then she has nothing
else to say! Let's go!

667
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:39,701
Sara, this is really important.

668
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:42,704
Anything you say may be key.
They might be in danger.

669
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:43,837
Let's go!

670
01:06:44,104 --> 01:06:46,608
- No, no! Corporal!
- Asun, you're making a mistake.

671
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:50,578
I might be dumb, but I know my
daughter doesn't have to say anything

672
01:06:50,912 --> 01:06:52,346
unless in the
presence of a lawyer.

673
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:53,347
Fucking films!

674
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,717
- Shut up!
- Come on, move it.

675
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:58,753
- Wait!
- What is it now?

676
01:06:58,887 --> 01:06:59,887
Blood.

677
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:08,695
Thanks.

678
01:07:29,017 --> 01:07:30,484
Not your finest moment.

679
01:07:38,292 --> 01:07:39,359
Relax.

680
01:07:40,628 --> 01:07:42,362
This isn't over, partner.

681
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:55,643
Get in. We'll give you a ride.

682
01:07:55,777 --> 01:07:59,179
Forget it, she's on her period.
She'll leave your car in a mess.

683
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:01,983
All right then. As you like.

684
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:05,485
And sorry if this brute
caused you any trouble.

685
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:15,495
Not a word, yeah? Not a word!
Not a word until we get home.

686
01:08:16,196 --> 01:08:18,432
Understood?

687
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,624
What the hell?

688
01:08:59,206 --> 01:09:02,242
The door's wide open.
This man's an idiot.

689
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:08,883
Get downstairs at once!
Turn the fan on if you're hot!

690
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:14,154
Sara! Get downstairs!

691
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:32,406
Sara... run...

692
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:37,979
- Please, take that off...
- I'm not a little girl!

693
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:40,982
- We have to soak it, it will stain.
- I'm not a little girl!

694
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:44,118
Stop treating me like one!
You embarrass me all the time.

695
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:46,954
Take that off at
once! Listen to me!

696
01:09:47,088 --> 01:09:48,455
If you're such a grown-up,

697
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:51,793
fair enough, you'll wash
your own clothes from now on.

698
01:09:52,225 --> 01:09:53,393
Your clothes...

699
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,568
and you'll also wash this.

700
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,237
What's this, Sara?

701
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,110
What's this blood, Sara?

702
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:12,847
This is Claudia's towel.

703
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,751
It's Claudia's.

704
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:18,986
Why did you lie to me?

705
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:22,289
Tell me what happened, Sara.

706
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,358
Tell me what happened.
What did you do?

707
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,997
What the fuck did you do?
Tell me! What happened?

708
01:10:30,131 --> 01:10:31,498
I just want to
help you. Tell me!

709
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:33,801
- You don't get me!
- I do!

710
01:10:33,935 --> 01:10:37,205
You're just like everyone
else. Just like them!

711
01:10:37,337 --> 01:10:40,474
Shut up! Shut up!
Leave me alone!

712
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:43,410
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! I hate you!

713
01:10:43,544 --> 01:10:46,948
I hate all of you! I hate you!

714
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:50,250
- I wish you were all dead!
- Enough!

715
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:52,352
I wish you were all dead!

716
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:55,489
Run!

717
01:10:56,323 --> 01:10:57,759
Fuck! Run!

718
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:32,059
There's no toilet paper.

719
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:36,798
There's no toilet paper! Mom?

720
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:39,466
Sara?

721
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:43,604
Sara!

722
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:51,044
No.

723
01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:29,016
No, no, no...

724
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,086
Help...

725
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:38,726
Look, it's Miss Bacon!

726
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:41,162
Bro, just who we needed
tonight! I can't believe it.

727
01:12:42,597 --> 01:12:43,941
Come over
here, Miss Bacon!

728
01:12:43,965 --> 01:12:48,870
The party is here! Bro,
lardass has scored.

729
01:12:49,003 --> 01:12:51,005
He's going to indulge
in some pork chops!

730
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:53,908
Come with me,
Piggy, my sausage is better!

731
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,676
Come, you'll
have a better time!

732
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,311
He's gonna eat her, bro.

733
01:12:57,477 --> 01:12:58,789
Look at that!

734
01:12:58,813 --> 01:13:02,750
He's gonna eat her,
bro. What a perfect night.

735
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:05,620
- Where are you going?
- Let them go.

736
01:13:08,522 --> 01:13:09,924
What are you doing?

737
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:15,863
What are you doing?

738
01:13:15,997 --> 01:13:18,431
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

739
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:21,669
My fucking arm!

740
01:13:23,004 --> 01:13:24,004
Are you okay?

741
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:27,608
Yes, yes.

742
01:18:13,961 --> 01:18:18,299
You're alive!

743
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:41,722
Sara!

744
01:18:42,624 --> 01:18:44,792
Where are the police? Sara!

745
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,228
Sara, he's gonna come back!

746
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:48,862
Sara!

747
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,801
Sara, where are they?

748
01:18:55,537 --> 01:18:56,737
Sara!

749
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:02,943
Sara, what's going on?

750
01:19:03,678 --> 01:19:04,678
Sara!

751
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:06,814
Sara, he's going to come back!

752
01:19:07,348 --> 01:19:08,882
Sara, where are they?

753
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,418
Sara, what's going on?

754
01:19:25,634 --> 01:19:27,368
You didn't tell anyone.

755
01:19:30,672 --> 01:19:32,206
Why?

756
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,509
Why?

757
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:37,911
Sara, why?

758
01:19:40,715 --> 01:19:45,853
Why, Sara?

759
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:50,457
Why?

760
01:19:53,494 --> 01:19:58,465
I'm scared. I was
scared! I do everything wrong!

761
01:19:59,534 --> 01:20:01,435
I do everything wrong!

762
01:20:02,002 --> 01:20:03,571
He's going to kill us!

763
01:20:04,004 --> 01:20:07,341
Sara, he's going to
kill us. Because of you.

764
01:20:09,410 --> 01:20:10,844
Sara, untie me! Hurry.

765
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:13,515
Sara, untie me!

766
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:15,215
Hurry up!

767
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:16,349
Untie me!

768
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:18,586
Sara, untie me!

769
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,954
No!

770
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:24,124
Fast!

771
01:20:24,258 --> 01:20:25,292
Hurry up!

772
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,160
Sara!

773
01:20:27,696 --> 01:20:28,730
Ow!

774
01:20:28,862 --> 01:20:31,533
You idiot! You idiot!

775
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:35,069
Enough!

776
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,550
Sara... help me.

777
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:55,989
Run!

778
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:01,295
Sara, run! Get help, hurry!

779
01:21:01,428 --> 01:21:03,565
No! Sara!

780
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:18,178
Fuck...

781
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:26,387
Sara!

782
01:21:27,454 --> 01:21:29,156
Run, Sara!

783
01:21:29,289 --> 01:21:30,424
Shut up!

784
01:21:30,558 --> 01:21:31,892
Run!

785
01:21:44,572 --> 01:21:48,409
Help! Help! Help!

786
01:21:48,976 --> 01:21:51,945
Help! Help!

787
01:21:52,847 --> 01:21:55,315
Help! Help!

788
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:08,162
- Where is she?
- She went for help.

789
01:22:13,267 --> 01:22:14,636
No!

790
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:18,238
- She's gone!
- Where is she?

791
01:22:29,049 --> 01:22:30,951
Sara!

792
01:23:33,046 --> 01:23:34,248
Sara!

793
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:39,521
Come back!

794
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:46,360
Come back, Sara!

795
01:24:56,564 --> 01:24:59,466
Sara, help me.

796
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:01,869
Shut up! Shut up!

797
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,050
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

798
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:21,488
No, no. You're not
going to die. No...

799
01:25:30,297 --> 01:25:31,699
We have to leave.

800
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:39,706
Come.

801
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:07,167
We'll do it together.

802
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:18,712
Help!

803
01:26:19,614 --> 01:26:22,416
Help! Help me!

804
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:25,485
Help! Help!

805
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,421
- Fuck them.
- Help!

806
01:26:28,022 --> 01:26:29,022
Help!

807
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:32,694
Help!

808
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,462
Help! Help!

809
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:38,633
Come on!

810
01:29:29,871 --> 01:29:30,872
No...

811
01:29:32,173 --> 01:29:35,142
No, no, no! No, no, no!

812
01:29:35,276 --> 01:29:37,311
No! No, no, no!

813
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:41,782
No, no, no! No!

814
01:30:33,567 --> 01:30:35,670

Sara, I'm sorry. Sara, please!

816
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:17,278
Sara, I won't say a thing.

817
01:31:17,411 --> 01:31:19,080
No! No!

818
01:32:25,146 --> 01:32:26,180
Sara...

819
01:34:04,478 --> 01:34:05,478
Sara?

820
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:10,084
What happened? Are you okay?

821
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:13,186
Help.

822
01:34:13,787 --> 01:34:16,157
Of course. Get on.
We'll head to town.

823
01:34:26,934 --> 01:34:27,934
Relax.

824
01:34:28,502 --> 01:34:29,502
It's all over.

825
01:34:38,779 --> 01:34:40,047
Hold on tight.

826
01:35:44,178 --> 01:35:46,847
PIGGY
