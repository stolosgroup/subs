00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,974
<i>Once in a while when I wake up</i>

3
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,811
<i>I find myself crying.</i>

4
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,482
<i>The dream I must have had
i can never recall.</i>

5
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,984
But...

6
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:08,485
But...

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,822
<i>The sensation that I've lost something</i>

8
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,617
<i>lingers for a long time after I wake up.</i>

9
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,502
<i>I'm always searching</i>

10
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,005
<i>for something, for someone.</i>

11
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:33,385
<i>This feeling has possessed me
i think from that Clay...</i>

12
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>That day when the stars came falling.</i>

13
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>It was almost as if...</i>

14
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,769
<i>As if a scene from a dream.</i>

15
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>Nothing more, nothing less</i>

16
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>than a beautiful view.</i>

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,030
<i>Ah, if only our voices speak at night</i>

18
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:59,536
<i>could ever reach the vely edge of this world,
and the time</i>

19
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:04,416
<i>instead of fading into air and dust</i>

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:10,380
<i>then what will the words could ever be?
Farthest words from 'probably'</i>

21
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:16,762
<i>let's make a promise, that will never fade
let's say it together in count of three, oh</i>

22
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,692
<i>ah, I'm told that some part of every wish
will be heard</i>

23
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>but lately I lost sight of the truth in those words</i>

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,450
<i>I can't even remember when I gave up believing
what could have been the reason?</i>

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:44,122
<i>Ah, the vely moment that the rain will stop
and the place rainbow born and dies</i>

26
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,291
<i>and where the end of this life lies</i>

27
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,462
<i>I've always been insisting
there was something that I've longing for</i>

28
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:59,763
<i>one day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented</i>

29
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:04,434
<i>we 'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time</i>

30
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>the five dimensions keep on teasing me
but I will keep on looking at you, dear</i>

31
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:14,152
<i>let's make a sign for when we say
"nice to meet you" again</i>

32
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,408
<i>I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name</i>

33
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>taki. Taki.</i>

34
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,274
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

35
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,528
My name is...

36
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,947
Mitsuha!

37
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,444
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

38
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,989
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

39
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,950
What? "Mitsuha"?

40
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,661
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

41
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,830
Hurry up!

42
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,185
What? What?

43
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,447
Do you want last night's leftovers?

44
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,990
You can have it.

45
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,159
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,828
Mitsuha, you're late!

47
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,121
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

48
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,045
Is this too much?

49
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,713
Oh well.

50
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,632
You're normal today.

51
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,051
You were nuts yesterday.

52
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,303
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,058
<i>Good morning, even/one.</i>

54
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,729
<i>This is an announcement
from ltomori town hall.</i>

55
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,733
<i>Regarding the mayoral election</i>

56
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:03,405
<i>to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...</i>

57
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:06,950
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

58
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:17,002
<i>the comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...</i>

59
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,004
Just make it up with him.

60
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,380
It's an adult matter.

61
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,758
<i>"Position of comet</i> tiamat" <i>$4264 are preparing
to observe the celestial show of the century.</i>

62
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,111
We're going now!

63
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,425
Study hard!

64
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,015
Mitsuha!

65
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,017
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

66
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,060
Morning.

67
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,021
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

68
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,814
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

69
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,108
You two get along so well.

70
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,568
We do not!

71
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,531
Your hair looks all right today.

72
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,699
What?

73
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,536
- Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

74
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:35,413
You were totally possessed!

75
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:40,919
Cut out the occultism.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

76
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,755
Huh? What are you talking about?

77
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,048
You don't remember?

78
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,051
And above all,

79
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:53,723
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

80
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,017
Only when these are achieved

81
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,562
can a safe and secure community
be created!

82
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,148
As the incumbent mayor...

83
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,985
He'll be reelected again anyway.

84
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,570
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

85
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,656
Hey, miyamizu.

86
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,907
Morning.

87
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,869
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along too.

88
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,079
Ew.

89
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,835
Mitsuha!

90
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,713
Stand up straight!

91
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,591
- He's strict with his family.
- I'm impressed.

92
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,094
- So embarrassing.
- Sucks to be her.

93
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,596
Mitsuha.

94
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,516
In front of everybody...

95
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,104
"Who are you?"

96
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,321
"Tasokare"

97
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,914
twilight, when it's
neither day nor night.

98
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:05,628
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

99
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,008
Older expressions include
"karetaso-doki"

100
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:10,925
"karetaso/kawatare = who is that?"

101
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,185
Kataware-doki? I think
that's a local dialect.

102
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,687
I've heard that ltom0ri's elderly
still use classical language.

103
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,612
Ok next, mlitsuha.

104
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,113
Yes.

105
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,159
Oh, so you remember your name today.

106
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,163
You don't remember?

107
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,377
Yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were.

108
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,339
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

109
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,469
What? No way! Really?

110
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,888
It was like you had amnesia.

111
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,351
Well, I do feel like
I've been in a strange dream lately...

112
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,854
A dream about someone else's life?

113
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,066
I can't remember clearly.

114
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,652
I know! That was...

115
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,986
Your previous life!

116
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,116
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

117
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,408
Stay out of this.

118
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,079
Oh! Tessie, did you write that
in my notebook?

119
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,165
Nothing.

120
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,878
But mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

121
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,131
You been feeling alright?

122
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,343
That's so strange. I feel fine.

123
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,305
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

124
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,016
Oh, don't remind me!

125
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,394
I can't stand this town anymore.

126
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:50,692
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

127
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,697
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

128
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,367
Trains come every 2 hours.

129
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,411
The store closes at 9 P.M.

130
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,371
No bookstore. No dentist.

131
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,915
"Pub mother" "pub cat's eye"
but 2 pubs for some reason.

132
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,041
No jobs.

133
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,168
No brides.

134
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,170
Short sunlight hours.

135
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,716
- Give me a break!
- What?

136
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,344
I mean... how about we stop by a café?

137
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,679
- A café?
- Really?

138
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,181
Where?

139
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,561
Hello.

140
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,396
Hello.

141
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,569
This is a café?

142
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,696
You knew there wasn't one.

143
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:39,365
Mlitsuha just went home.

144
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,952
Things must be rough for her.

145
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,413
Well, she takes center stage.

146
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,915
Yeah.

147
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,252
Hey, Tessie.

148
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,046
What?

149
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,882
What will you do after you graduate?

150
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,760
What's this?
You asking about my future?

151
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:06,059
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

152
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,743
I'd rather do that too.

153
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,496
You're not ready yet, yotsuha.

154
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,957
Listen to the thread's voice.

155
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,293
When you keep twining like that,

156
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,631
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

157
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,258
Threads don't talk.

158
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,551
She means, "concentrate."

159
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:46,349
1,000 years of ltomori's history is etched
into our braided cords.

160
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:50,270
Listen. 200 years ago...

161
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,021
Here she goes again.

162
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:58,778
Sandal maker mayugords bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

163
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,240
The shrine and old documents
were destroyed

164
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,950
and this is known <i>as...</i>

165
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,994
The great fire of mayugoro.

166
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,956
The fire has his name? Poor mayugoro.

167
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:16,629
So the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on.

168
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,592
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

169
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:26,097
That's the important task
we at miyamizu shrine have.

170
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,812
But that foolish son-in-law...

171
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:38,026
As if leaving shinto priesthood and
this house weren't enough,

172
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,029
now politics? He's hopeless.

173
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,489
Have another, my man.

174
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,911
I'm counting on your help again.

175
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,246
Leave it to me.

176
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,125
You'll get votes from the
kadoiri and sakagami districts.

177
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,543
How's it going with her?

178
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,712
It's not that easy.

179
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,424
I smell corruption.

180
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,259
Don't be ridiculous.

181
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,928
Bring us a few more hot <i>sake.</i>

182
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,221
Ok.

183
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,891
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

184
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,143
Learn how to use explosives.

185
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,270
Can't hear you.

186
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,271
Yes!

187
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,913
We both have it rough, don't we?

188
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,059
Is that yotsuha? She's all grown up.

189
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,812
They're both pretty like their mother.

190
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,564
Hey.

191
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,774
Hey.

192
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,600
It's the oldest <i>sake</i> in the world.

193
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:40,565
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

194
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,611
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate
sake made that way?

195
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,488
Of course they do.

196
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,826
Hey, look. It's mliyamizu.

197
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,750
Oh! I could never do that!

198
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,544
Isn't she embarrassed?

199
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,421
I can't believe it.

200
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:22,732
Cheer up, mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

201
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,943
I envy your pre-pubescent
lack of concern.

202
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:30,823
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and
use the money to go to Tokyo?

203
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,451
Where do you get such ideas?

204
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:38,831
Sell them with photos and making videos.
Name it "shrine maiden's sake."

205
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,708
You'll make money!

206
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,794
"Shrine maiden's <i>sake"</i>

207
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,547
no. That breaks the liquor tax law.

208
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,842
That's the problem?

209
00:16:56,224 --> 00:17:01,103
I hate this town! I hate this life!

210
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:05,525
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

211
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,697
What a fool...

212
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,560
Ow!

213
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,398
Ouch...

214
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,283
Where...

215
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,588
Somethings there...

216
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,477
Ow!

217
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
Taki! Are you up?

218
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,152
It was your turn to cook.
Wake up on time.

219
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,486
I'm sorry.

220
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,325
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

221
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,492
Ok.

222
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,455
Go to school even if you're late.
See you.

223
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,333
Have a nice day.

224
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,720
What a strange dream.

225
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,350
"From tsukasa:
Run, you're late!"

226
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,355
What? Who's it from?
Tsukasa? Who's that?

227
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:19,033
I have to use the bathroom.

228
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,752
This is too realistic.

229
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,096
"Shinjuku station"

230
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,992
I'm in Tokyo.

231
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,623
"Jingu high school"

232
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,625
- where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

233
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,627
The front act at the next gig...

234
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,630
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

235
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,636
Taki!

236
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,433
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

237
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,102
You ignored my text.

238
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,979
Oh, tsukasa?

239
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,899
At least you sound apologetic.

240
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,903
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

241
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,656
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

242
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:26,327
- Uh... well... I...
- Feminine?

243
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,870
I!

244
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,580
<i>L</i>?

245
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:30,915
<i>L</i>?

246
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:38,839
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

247
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,425
You seem to have a dialect.

248
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,677
Where's your lunch?

249
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,806
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

250
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,017
- You got something?
- Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

251
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,773
Thank you.

252
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,026
Let's go to a café.

253
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,695
Oh that one? Ok. Coming, taki?

254
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,490
What? What? What?

255
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,283
A café?

256
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,372
Nice timbervvork up there.

257
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,666
Yeah, attention to detail.

258
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,334
Taki, have you decided?

259
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,798
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

260
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,634
What age are you from again?

261
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,555
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

262
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,896
What a great dream.

263
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,321
Oh no, what should I do?
I'm late for work!

264
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,740
Your shift is today?

265
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,909
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

266
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,329
Oh! Um...

267
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,250
Where do I work?

268
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,835
What?

269
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,176
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

270
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,387
Table 12! Taki!

271
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,848
Here you go.

272
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,851
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

273
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,352
We didn't order that.

274
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,855
Taki, I said no more truffles!

275
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,857
Taki, can't hear you!

276
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:20,858
Taki!

277
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,862
When is this dream going to end?

278
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,581
Hey. Hey waiter.

279
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,874
Oh, yes?

280
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,795
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

281
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,382
We could have gotten hurt.

282
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:49,970
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

283
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,139
<i>Uh, we“...</i>

284
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,977
But... there are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

285
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,064
Excuse me.

286
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,358
Is everything ok?

287
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,401
I'll handle this.

288
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,072
What's wrong with you today?

289
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,660
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

290
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:13,786
Oh, really?

291
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,038
I hope you weren't hurt.

292
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,341
Um...

293
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:28,842
Okudera...

294
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,885
Ms.Okudera.

295
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,972
<i>Msfikudera. Thank you...</i>

296
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,515
A stroke of bad luck today.

297
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,641
No, uh...

298
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,184
Bet it was a set-up.

299
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,813
Handled it according to the manual, but...

300
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,358
Oh, ms.Okudera, your skirt!

301
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:46,694
You ok?

302
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,696
- What happened?
- Slashed.

303
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,698
That dick from earlier?

304
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,242
What now? Do you remember his face?

305
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,618
No.

306
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,453
Come with me.

307
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,372
Hey, taki!

308
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,041
Take off your skirt.

309
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,502
Oh! I'll look the other way!

310
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,675
This won't take long.

311
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,139
Done!

312
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,893
Wow, taki! It looks better than before!

313
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,190
Thank you for saving me today.

314
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,404
Actually, I was concerned about you.

315
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,657
You're weak but quick-tempered.

316
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,410
I like you better today.

317
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,748
Never knew you had a feminine side.

318
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,917
"Jr yamanote line: 8 min."

319
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,012
What a realistic dream
if I say so myself.

320
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,435
Oh, he keeps a diary.

321
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,941
He's so organized.

322
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,694
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

323
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,449
Oh! That's her!

324
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,831
A crush, maybe?

325
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:34,468
"Walked to the station with ms.Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

326
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,304
"Who are you?"

327
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:50,818
"Mlitsuha"

328
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,835
what is this?

329
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,336
"Mlitsuha"

330
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,842
wham? Wham?

331
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,885
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"
What's going on?

332
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,763
Let's go to a café again.

333
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,182
Sorry, I have to go to work.

334
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,184
Do you remember where to go?

335
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,107
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

336
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,694
Oh, never mind. See you.

337
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:37,489
He's acting normal today.

338
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,325
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

339
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,201
What?

340
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,039
Wha... what?

341
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,417
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

342
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,210
You walked home with her!

343
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,507
Did I really? With ms.Okudera?

344
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,217
What happened afterwards?

345
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,721
I don't really remember.

346
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,306
Oh really, now?

347
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,892
Coming through.

348
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,728
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

349
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,981
Let's make this a good one.

350
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,233
Right, taki?

351
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,330
"Mitsuha? Who are you?
What are you?"

352
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,833
You're not touching your boobs today.

353
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,336
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

354
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,132
Boobs?

355
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,344
Morning.

356
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,436
Why is everyone staring at me?

357
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,940
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

358
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:53,607
Huh?

359
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,068
"Still life drawing"

360
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,531
doesn't matter who wins.
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

361
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,785
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

362
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,121
They mean me, right?

363
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,915
Well, yeah.

364
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,292
Hey, mitsuha!

365
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:26,974
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

366
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,686
Mitsuha?

367
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,445
Is this... could this be...

368
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:45,367
Could this be that we're really...

369
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,869
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

370
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,789
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

371
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,458
Switching places?

372
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,079
<i>I'm beginning to get what's going on.</i>

373
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,333
<i>Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.</i>

374
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,544
<i>I switch with mitsuha at random,</i>

375
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,588
<i>a few times a week unexpectedly.</i>

376
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,548
<i>Sleep triggers it.
The cause is a mystery.</i>

377
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:48,764
<i>My memory of the switch is hazy
after I wake up.</i>

378
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:52,267
<i>But we're definitely switching places.</i>

379
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,271
<i>It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us. So...</i>

380
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,066
<i>So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.</i>

381
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:01,693
"No baths! No looking!
No touching!"

382
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,457
<i>To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.</i>

383
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,417
But...

384
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,960
But...

385
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,713
- That girl!
- That guy!

386
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,648
<i>Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!</i>

387
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,904
<i>Stop wasting my money!</i>

388
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,824
<i>It's your body eating.
And I'm working too!</i>

389
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,241
"Braided cords..."

390
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,953
<i>You work too many shifts!</i>

391
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:54,621
<i>It's 'cause you waste money!</i>

392
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>Grabbeo' cofiee with Ms. okudera.
You two have a good thing going!</i>

393
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,858
<i>Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!</i>

394
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,361
<i>Taki, why is a girl in love with me?</i>

395
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,406
<i>You're more popular when I'm you.</i>

396
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:29,990
<i>Don't be full of yourself!
Not like you have a girlfriend!</i>

397
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,660
<i>You don't have a boyfriend!</i>

398
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,537
"Fool/idiot"

399
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,581
I'm single because I want to be!

400
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,313
I shouldn't for her sake.

401
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,652
You sure do like your boobs.

402
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,155
We're going now! Get ready!

403
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,370
<i>Comet 77amaz' has been visible
to the naked eye fora few days now.</i>

404
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,164
<i>When and where can it be seen?</i>

405
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:19,915
"Comet tiamat to reach perigee"

406
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,714
<i>so it can be seen above Venus...</i>

407
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,674
Why the uniform?

408
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:42,646
Grandma, why is the body
of our shrine's god so far away?

409
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,274
I don't know because of mayugoro.

410
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,734
Who's that?

411
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,194
What? He's famous!

412
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,746
Here, grandma.

413
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,711
Whoa, mlitsuha.

414
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:21,726
Mlitsuha, yotsuha, do you know "musubi"?

415
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,270
Mlusubi?

416
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:28,525
Mlusubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

417
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,736
This word has profound meaning.

418
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:37,701
Tying thread is mlusubi.
Connecting people is mlusubi.

419
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,245
The flow of time is mlusubi.

420
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,623
These are all the god's power.

421
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,377
So the braided cords that we make

422
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:52,924
are the god's art and represent
the flow of time itself.

423
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,261
They converge and take shape.

424
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,513
They twist, tangle

425
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:03,143
sometimes unravel, break,
then connect again.

426
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,772
Musub/ - knotting. That's time.

427
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,319
Drink.

428
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,778
Thank you.

429
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,905
I want some too!

430
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,283
That's also mlusubi.

431
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,329
Whether it be water, rice, or <i>sake,</i>

432
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:27,792
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul, that's musubi.

433
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,462
So today's offering

434
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:36,301
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

435
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,846
Hey, I see it!

436
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:47,187
That's the body
of miyamizu shrine's god?

437
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,582
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

438
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,543
It means the underworld.

439
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,046
It's the underworld!

440
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,845
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

441
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,223
what is most important to you.

442
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,102
The kuchikamisake.

443
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,604
The kuchikamisake?

444
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,608
You'll offer it inside the god's body.

445
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,404
It's half of you.

446
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,324
<i>Half of mitsuha...</i>

447
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,302
It's twilight - "kataware-d0ki" already.

448
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,388
Katawa re-d o ki?

449
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,816
Oh yeah,

450
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,776
maybe I can see the comet.

451
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,779
The comet?

452
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,406
Oh,

453
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,408
mitsuha,

454
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,911
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

455
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,800
Tears? Why?

456
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,430
"L'm almost there.
Looking forward to it!"

457
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,434
Ms.Okudera? What's she talking about?

458
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,645
What did i\/litsuha do this time?

459
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,440
A date?

460
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,992
<i>A date with ms.Okudera tomorrow!</i>

461
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,453
<i>Meet at 70:30 A.M. at the station!</i>

462
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,458
...was what I'd planned, but...

463
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,473
Taki.

464
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,559
Sorry. Did you wait long?

465
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,228
Yes. No...

466
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:35,438
Um...

467
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,198
I just got here.

468
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,492
Good. Let's go.

469
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:53,081
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

470
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,961
Hey?

471
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,508
I...

472
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,718
Why?

473
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,519
<i>I wanted to go on this date,</i>

474
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:20,024
<i>but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!</i>

475
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:29,033
<i>However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before,</i>

476
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,079
I don't know what to say...

477
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:37,500
<i>So below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.</i>

478
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,918
Really?

479
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,295
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

480
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,800
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting."

481
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,303
She's making fun of me.

482
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,307
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

483
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,333
taki...

484
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,795
You're like a different person today.

485
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,352
Urn, ms.Okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner...

486
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,813
Let's call it a day.

487
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,650
Yes.

488
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,320
Taki, you... sorry if I'm wrong.

489
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,367
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

490
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,871
But now you like someone else.

491
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,500
No I don't!

492
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,417
Really?

493
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,878
No! That's not true at all.

494
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,964
I wonder.

495
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,760
Oh well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

496
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:30,655
<i>By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.</i>

497
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:36,369
What is she saying?

498
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:43,167
"Mitsuha miyamizu"

499
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,191
oh, it's you, Tessie.

500
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:13,740
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

501
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:18,119
What? The festival? Well...

502
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:24,167
Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

503
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,712
Ok, got it. Later, then.

504
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,092
You just want to see her in ayukata.

505
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,178
What!? No!

506
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,305
That didn't even occur to me.

507
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,434
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

508
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,561
Maybe you annoyed her.

509
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:44,771
Come on!

510
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,813
Sorry I'm late.

511
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,356
- Here she is!
- Finally!

512
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,779
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, i\/litsuha?

513
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,073
Your hair!

514
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,910
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

515
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,963
You think some guy is the reason?
Ditched, maybe?

516
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,925
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

517
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,427
She said she just felt like it.

518
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,972
Really? She just felt like cutting off
that much hair?

519
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,934
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

520
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,538
Wow!

521
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:07,103
<i>The number you are trying to call is not
reachable or has been turned offi...</i>

522
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:15,361
<i>I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,</i>

523
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,239
<i>I thought. But...</i>

524
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,117
<i>For some reason, after that,</i>

525
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:25,997
<i>mitsuha and I never
switched places again.</i>

526
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:04,035
"Mountains in gifu prefecture"

527
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,464
"hida mountains"

528
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:23,572
what the... what are you doing here?

529
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,953
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

530
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:38,087
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me
at home and at work.

531
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,463
Takagi will cover your shift.

532
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,717
<i>Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!</i>

533
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,844
This isn't funny.

534
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,263
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

535
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:50,516
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

536
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:51,767
A con act?

537
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,061
You're meeting an online friend.

538
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,522
Well no, not exactly...

539
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,858
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

540
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,446
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

541
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,239
I'm not a kid!

542
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:12,079
<i>The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.</i>

543
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:16,751
<i>So I decided to go see mitsuha
in person.</i>

544
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,004
<i>I wanted to meet her. But...</i>

545
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,553
What? You don't know where?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

546
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,512
Yes.

547
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,894
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

548
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,730
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

549
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,065
I did not plan a tour!

550
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,526
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

551
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,696
Oh how cute! Look!

552
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:46,864
So annoying.

553
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,033
Oh, it moved!

554
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,188
So it's impossible after all...

555
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,067
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

556
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,239
You haven't done anything.

557
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,035
Atakayama ramen.

558
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,578
Atakayama ramen.

559
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,414
Oh, then a takayama ramen.

560
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,625
- Ok. 3 ramens.
- Ok.

561
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,171
Can we return to Tokyo today?

562
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,466
We could be cutting it close.
I'll check.

563
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,342
Thanks.

564
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,803
Are you all right with that?

565
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,685
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

566
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,443
Why young man,
that's ltomori, isn't it?

567
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,989
It's a very good drawing.
Isn't it, dear?

568
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:15,161
Yeah, it's ltomori.
Brings back memories.

569
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,496
He was born in ltomori.

570
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,081
Itomori...?

571
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:25,588
Yes! Ltomori town! That's it!
It's nearby, isn't it?

572
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,507
- What are you...
- Ltomori was...

573
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,510
Ltomori? No way!

574
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,305
Is it where that comet...?

575
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,274
"Keep out"

576
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,899
hey. Ls this really the place?

577
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:30,903
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

578
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:34,698
No. I'm sure this is it.

579
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:40,412
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

580
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,331
That can't be true!

581
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:47,711
Surely you remember that disaster
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

582
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,838
Died?

583
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,343
Died 3 years ago?

584
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,596
That can't be.

585
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:02,184
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

586
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,203
They're disappearing...

587
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,424
Comet tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

588
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,724
"meteor strikes, wipes out town" nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

589
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,977
"Town annihilated"

590
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,729
"over 500 dead or missing"

591
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,230
"lt0m0ri, the town that vanished"

592
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,235
a fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck Japan.

593
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,529
"It0m0ri, comet, damage"

594
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,869
the point of impact was here.

595
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:08,250
At 8:42 P.M., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

596
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,129
"List of the names of victims"

597
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,511
and now nobody lives in ltomori anymore.

598
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,273
Tessie and Sayaka...

599
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,611
"Mitsuha miyamizu"

600
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:42,618
it has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died 3 years ago!

601
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:48,916
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible.

602
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,042
So...

603
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,835
<i>You 're dreaming</i> now...

604
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,295

What did l...?

608
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,735
Lively up there.

609
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,446
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

610
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,823
No problem.

611
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,033
How's taki?

612
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,453
He's still reading articles on ltomori.

613
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,832
Newspapers and magazines
at the time at random it seems.

614
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:38,257
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

615
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:42,052
Oh. I'd quit recently, but...

616
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,264
What do you think about taki's story?

617
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,936
I liked him.

618
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:57,401
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

619
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,739
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

620
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:06,869
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

621
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:14,793
But I'm sure he met someone
and that someone changed him.

622
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:16,962
That much is for sure, I think.

623
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,897
It was all just a dream.

624
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:42,571
I recognized the scenery because
i remembered the news from 3 years ago.

625
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,658
If not that, then... a ghost?

626
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,914
No... was I fantasizing?

627
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:59,254
Her name... what was it?

628
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,426
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

629
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,430
Oh, ms.Okudera. I, uh...

630
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:14,436
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

631
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,942
No problem.

"braided cords of ltomori"

634
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,868
ls that a braided cord you're wearing?

635
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:35,958
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

636
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:40,254
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

637
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,966
Who was it?

638
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:49,221
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

639
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,265
Yes. ...No.

640
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:58,730
Someone who makes braided cords
told me before...

641
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,942
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

642
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:08,073
The threads twist, tangle,
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

643
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,286
Maybe at that place...

00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:05,797
"I have to go somewhere. Return to Tokyo
without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

650
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,552
Taki...

651
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,328
Eat this up there.

652
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:41,333
Your drawing of ltomori... it was good.

653
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:23,709
<i>They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,</i>

654
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:27,379
<i>sometimes unravel,
then connect again...</i>

655
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,884
<i>Musubi - knotting. That's time.</i>

656
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:44,646
There it is!

657
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,316
It's really there!

658
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,320
It wasn't just a dream!

659
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,854
From here is the underworld.

660
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,838
It's the <i>sake</i> we brought.

661
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,468
This is my sister's, and this is mine.

662
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:05,894
Before the comet struck... so the
i\/litsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

663
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,899
Our timelines weren't in step.

664
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,112
Half of her...

665
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,836
Mlusubi.

666
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,048
If time can really be turned back,

667
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,301
give me one last chance...

668
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,733
The comet!

669
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,093
Your name is i\/litsuha.

670
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,727
You're both my treasures.

671
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:13,271
You're a big sister now.

672
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,857
"Get well soon, mom."

673
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:18,526
I'm so sorry, my dears.

674
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:23,657
Dad, when is morn going to come home?

675
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:25,992
I couldn't save her.

676
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,036
Get a hold of yourself!

677
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,412
Who cares about the shrine?

678
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,206
You're the adopted son-in-law!

679
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,417
I loved my wife futaba.
Not miyamizu shrine.

680
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,002
Get out of here!

681
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,966
L\/litsuha, yotsuha,

682
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,636
you'll be with grandma from now on.

683
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,350
"Who are you?"
Who am I? No, who are you?

684
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,143
"Fool"

685
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:58,984
he's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

686
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,444
I...

687
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,821
I'm going to Tokyo.

688
01:03:02,946 --> 01:03:04,030
What? Hey, mitsuha!

689
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,662
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

690
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:14,124
Oh yeah, the comet.

691
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,836
Today's the peak of its brightness...

692
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,963
<i>Mitsuha! Don't stay there!</i>

693
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:25,510
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!</i>

694
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:30,015
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there!</i>

695
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,143
<i>Mitsuha! Mitsuha!</i>

696
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:35,353
<i>Mitsuha!</i>

697
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,666
I'm i\/litsuha! She's still alive!

698
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,429
L\/litsuha, are you touching...

699
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,100
My sister!

700
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,355
Yotsuha!

701
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,777
L\/litsuha has finally lost it.

702
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,446
I'm leaving without her.

703
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:29,032
She's lost it.

704
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:31,701
She's completely lost it.

705
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,161
Scary.

706
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:37,665
<i>Comet 77amaz' has been visible
to the naked eye fora few days now.</i>

707
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,628
<i>Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 P.M.,</i>

708
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,381
<i>and will achieve its maximum brightness.</i>

709
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:47,384
It's tonight. There's still time.

710
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:49,761
Good morning, mitsuha.

711
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,596
Oh...

712
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,308
You're not i\/iitsuha, are you?

713
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,604
You knew, grandma?

714
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:06,152
No, but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories.

715
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:12,659
I also remember seeing strange dreams
when I was a young girl.

716
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:19,707
Although now I've forgotten about
whose life I was dreaming about.

717
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,584
Forgotten...

718
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:26,673
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

719
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:31,678
There were times your mother and i
had similar experiences.

720
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,391
Maybe those dreams that
the miyamizu people had

721
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,145
were all for what will happen today.

722
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,689
Grandma, listen.

723
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:48,069
A comet will strike ltomori tonight
and everyone will die.

724
01:05:55,326 --> 01:06:00,665
<i>"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, grandma.</i>

725
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,501
I won't let them die!

726
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,172
Oh! What happened, i\/litsuha?

727
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:11,593
Your... your hair!

728
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,262
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

729
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:15,847
Oh, that's it?

730
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:20,143
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

731
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,564
So we have to act!

732
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:31,070
Why aren't you at school?

733
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:35,909
Uh... we have to save the town.

734
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,703
The community wireless system?

735
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,331
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

736
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,834
"Superimposition, frequency"

737
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:49,881
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

738
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,509
Hey! Don't come so close!

739
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,719
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

740
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:57,889
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

741
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,099
"Club discontinued - keep out"

742
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,399
got them. Here's your change.

743
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,817
Sorry, Sayaka.

744
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,319
It's all right.

745
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,863
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

746
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:19,827
What about you? Have you come up
with an escape plan?

747
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,542
What? A bomb?

748
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,213
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

749
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,714
Broadcast hijacking?

750
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:37,053
The town's wireless system can be easily
jacked using the startup frequency.

751
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,640
So we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school.

752
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:45,937
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

753
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,232
It's... it's totally a crime!

754
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:50,900
You do the broadcast.

755
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,611
- Why?
- You're in the broadcast club.

756
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,405
I'm in charge of explosives.

757
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:57,615
I'll go talk to the mayor.

758
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,995
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

759
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:05,123
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

760
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,417
It's a perfect plan.

761
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:13,172
Oh, whatever. It's just a
what-if fantasy, isn't it?

762
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,633
What? Well...

763
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,679
Not necessarily! Do you know
how lake ltomori was formed?

764
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:20,305
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

765
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,437
Oh! So that's why...

766
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,814
You're right, Tessie!

767
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:35,445
Let's do it together!

768
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,951
What on earth are you talking about?

769
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,665
I said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

770
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,958
Shut your mouth.

771
01:08:54,881 --> 01:08:57,967
"The comet will split and
strike the town"?

772
01:08:58,092 --> 01:08:58,468
"It0m0ri town hall"

773
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,973
how dare you spout such nonsense?

774
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,560
If you're serious, then you're sick.

775
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,980
Madness must be from the miyamizu side.

776
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,611
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

777
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,823
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

778
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,578
You son of a...!

779
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,924
Mitsuha! No...

780
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,051
Who...

781
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,179
Who are you?

782
01:09:57,402 --> 01:09:59,404
See you later at the festival.

783
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,280
Let's meet at the shrine.

784
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:02,448
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

785
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,117
- See you.
- Later.

786
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:07,120
You shouldn't go!

787
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,123
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

788
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,499
What are you saying?

789
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:12,625
Mitsuha!

790
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,086
- What was that?
- Let's go.

791
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,588
What are you doing?

792
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,882
Could i\/litsuha...

793
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:23,636
Could she have persuaded them?
Ls it my fault?

794
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:27,890
Yotsuha, leave town with grandma
before nightfall.

795
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,934
You'll die if you stay here!

796
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,978
What are you saying?

797
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:36,524
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

798
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,610
Tokyo?

799
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,572
Hey, mitsuha!

800
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,909
How did it go with your old man?

801
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,705
Hey, i\/litsuha?

802
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,540
What's wrong with her?

803
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,791
No idea.

804
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:05,511
Are you there?

805
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,931
Is something over there?

806
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,600
Let me use your bike.

807
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:11,726
Hey, what the...

808
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:13,060
Hey, mitsuha!

809
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:15,646
What about our plan?

810
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,648
Get ready as planned!

811
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,692
Please!

812
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,179
I'm taki again.

813
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:54,519
What's taki doing here?

814
01:12:03,528 --> 01:12:04,320
The town...

815
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,656
Is gone.

816
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:19,877
At that moment... did I...

817
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,841
Die?

818
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,228
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

819
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,732
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

820
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,330
I'm going to Tokyo.

821
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,748
What? Now?

822
01:12:58,165 --> 01:12:59,250
Why?

823
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,751
A date.

824
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:03,087
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

825
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:05,131
Not my date.

826
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,426
I'll come home tonight.

827
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:16,267
<i>If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?</i>

828
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,978
<i>He might not like it.</i>

829
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,823
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

830
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:32,909
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

831
01:13:33,034 --> 01:13:35,286
<i>But what if we did?</i>

832
01:13:35,912 --> 01:13:40,291
<i>What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?</i>

833
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:41,042
"Tiamat makes closest approach tomorrow"

834
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:47,214
<i>he'd be a bit glad to see me?</i>

835
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:52,303
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

836
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:55,222
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

837
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:57,892
But...

838
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,812
<i>...one thing is certain.</i>

839
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:06,651
<i>If we see each other, we'll know.</i>

840
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:10,738
<i>That you were the one who was inside me.</i>

841
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:14,659
<i>That I was the one who was inside you.</i>

842
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,494
I'm sorry.

843
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:48,859
Excuse me.

844
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:25,396
<i>That time 3 years ago,
before I got to know you...</i>

845
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:30,401
Taki.

846
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:32,903
Taki.

847
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:35,990
Taki.

848
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,160
Um... it's me.

849
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,748
Don't you remember me?

850
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,417
Who are you?

851
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,590
I'm sorry.

852
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:01,932
<i>But he's taki.</i>

853
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,935
<i>Weird girl.</i>

854
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:14,820
Hey!

855
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,323
What's your name?

856
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:18,991
Mitsuha!

857
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,952
My name is mitsuha!

858
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:34,215
<i>That time 3 years ago, you came...</i>

859
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,425
<i>To see me!</i>

860
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:48,646
Taki?

861
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,073
Mitsuha!

862
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,617
Taki?

863
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,800
Mitsuha!

864
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:21,804
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

865
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:23,973
Taki!

866
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,475
Taki, where are you?

867
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,519
It's i\/litsuha.

868
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,771
I can hear her, but...

869
01:17:31,689 --> 01:17:34,859
Taki, where are you?

870
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:35,943
Taki!

871
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,375
Taki, are you...

872
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:54,170
There?

873
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:20,863
It's twilight - "kataware-doki."

874
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,879
Mitsuha.

875
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,553
Taki.

876
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,350
Taki. It's really you.

877
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:54,605
Taki!

878
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,899
I came to see you.

879
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:01,237
It wasn't easy because
you were so far away.

880
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:06,116
But how? At that moment, <i>I...</i>

881
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,661
I drank your kuchikamisake.

882
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,625
You drank that?

883
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:17,127
You idiot! Pervert!

884
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,215
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

885
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,300
How do you know that?

886
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,052
Yotsuha saw it.

887
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,889
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

888
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,432
Just once?

889
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,395
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

890
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,438
Sorry.

891
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,941
Oh, this...

892
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:43,445
Oh. Really, why'd you come see me
before I knew you?

893
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,781
There's no way I'd recognize you.

894
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:49,326
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

895
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,912
Now you keep it.

896
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:54,957
Yes.

897
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,174
How is it?

898
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,468
Not bad.

899
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,012
You're lying!

900
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,472
No, I... sorry.

901
01:20:10,597 --> 01:20:13,017
You're really so...!

902
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,491
Mitsuha, you still have
things to do. Listen.

903
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:33,579
It's coming.

904
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,623
Don't worry. You've still got time.

905
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,584
Yes, I'll try.

906
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,047
Kataware-d0ki is almost...

907
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,673
Over.

908
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,554
Hey, mitsuha. So we don't forget
when we wake up...

909
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:58,687
Let's write our names
on each other. Here.

910
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:01,231
Ok!

911
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:11,909
Mitsuha?

912
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,038
Hey, i\/litsuha?

913
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,840
I wanted to tell you.

914
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:33,639
Wherever you are in the world,
I'll search for you.

915

Your name is i\/litsuha.

916
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,315
It's ok. I remember.

917
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:47,611

Who are you?

920
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,714
Why did I come here?

921
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,760
I came here to see her.

922
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,597
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

923

Who was it? Who?
Who did I come to see?

to forget. I shouldn't forget!

- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

936

Explain everything to me later.

937

That's going to fall? Really?

938
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:38,180
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

939
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,974
What? You saw it, huh?

940
