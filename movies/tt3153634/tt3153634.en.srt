00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,690
When's the meeting?

5
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,060
What?

6
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,360
You're ready already?

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,200
Okay, okay.

8
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,640
Hold on.

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,740
Man...

10
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,510
You never came to
the PTA meetings last year.

11
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,980
If you're late,
you'll get on their bad side.

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,990
I'm almost ready.

13
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,150
I didn't even do
the breakfast dishes.

14
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,020
Do that later
and come out now!

15
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,690
Okay, okay.

16
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,990
I'm ready!

17
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm leaving!

18
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,870
I'm on my way.

19
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,790
Where do I go?

20
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,500
Dog meat?

21
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,370
I can't eat that.

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,840
It's time for our lunch break!

25
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,210
Today's menu is chicken soup!

26
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,210
I, the factory manager,
will eat last as always.

27
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,040
Please only take one piece

28
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,350
for those behind you.

29
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,380
Hey! You!

30
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,560
Don't eat two pieces
like last time!

31
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,390
Or I'll kill ya!

32
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,360
Dong-hoon?

33
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,890
Let's eat together.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,990
Okay!

35
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,100
Cheers everyone!

36
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,370
Summer break is coming up.

37
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,140
What should we get the teacher?

38
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,770
How about a dress?

39
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,710
- Good idea.
- Great.

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,910
What do you think, Mi-hee?

41
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,650
Huh?

42
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:48,880
How about a flowerpot...

43
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,160
Forget it!

44
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,360
These days, we give gift cards.

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,630
How much should we give?

46
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,940
You decide, Vice-President.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,770
- Of course.
- Yeah.

48
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,770
Let's go.

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Then, I'll text you
on how much we'll pitch in.

50
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,970
- It was good.
- Yeah.

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,840
- I'm full.
- Did we collect fees today?

52
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,840
How much do we pay?

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,010
- We ate a lot.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,220
Hope's Mom? You'll pay?

55
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,820
- Me?
- Why not.

56
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,460
How about you and I
split the bill this time?

57
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,890
I didn't even eat!

58
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,830
She's too busy at the store
and never came out much.

59
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,900
She always said
she should treat you ladies.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,410
Should we give
Hope's Mom a chance then?

61
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,170
Why not?

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,370
- Thanks, Mrs. IM.
- Thanks.

63
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,880
How much you got?

64
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,010
I have $20.

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,350
Take credit cards?

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,150
$198? That's insane!

67
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,300
Damn women ate a whole dog!

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,470
It's to get on their good side.

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,990
Or else your kid will get left out.

<i>WATERMELON $20</i>

72
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,170
Why is it so dang expensive?

73
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,080
Tell your husband
to give Hope's Dad a raise.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,270
He's only the manager,
not the boss.

75
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,150
By the way,
aren't you going to tell him?

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,620
How can he not tell?

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,820
Looks like it's a boy.

78
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,330
He has no interest in me.

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,120
Then, how'd you end up
getting pregnant?

80
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,030
Honestly, we did it once
in 3 years and it happened.

81
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,540
3 years?

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,970
My husband is always all over me.

83
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,380
He can't get enough of me.

84
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,750
How can I raise two
when one is so hard?

85
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,150
Why you!

86
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,250
Have the baby.
It'll grow on its own.

87
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,330
Really none left?

88
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,290
Nope.

89
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
No sense of loyalty!

90
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,940
IM Dong-hoon?
Is it good?

91
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,380
Yup!

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,820
I only ate one, honest.

93
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,420
The bones can't be from one!

94
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,320
Like it?

95
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,520
It's good.

96
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,690
Don't you get food at home?

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,760
Yeah, I do. Just rice, though.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,330
I'm so skinny,
but my wife's getting fat.

99
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,940
Good for you, pal.

100
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
I can't eat at home or here.

101
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,610
I only get rice at home and here, too.

102
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,800
And my three sons say I stink

103
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,380
and won't ever come to me.

104
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,250
Want it?

105
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,520
- Forget it, man!
- Fine.

106
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,690
Give it to me.
You got three of the same.

107
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,630
But this is a rare card.

108
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,600
Yours isn't.

109
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,930
Want it?

110
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,970
Let's trade with this.

111
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,910
This one for five of those.

112
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,140
Young-seok! You cheapskate!

113
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,250
- No deal! Cheapskate!
- Let's go.

114
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,800
What?

115
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,400
What?

116
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,150
Wait for me!

117
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,230
Dang!

118
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,480
I died again! This sucks!

119
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,510
Hey!

120
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,870
HAN Young-seok!

121
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
What?

122
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,810
That's not yours!
Don't hit it!

123
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,980
I paid to play on this!
What's it to you!

124
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,850
Why you little!

125
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,860
Little?

126
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,800
Fine. Your face is way bigger.
So there!

127
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,530
Wanna die!

128
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:06,640
Mommy! I'm home!

129
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,870
Hi, Hope.

130
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,590
Young-seok is the problem.

131
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,310
What are you grumbling?

132
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,720
Try this.

133
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,260
I don't get this at all.

134
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,740
Get what?

135
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,000
It's a math question.

136
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,540
I can solve most questions.

137
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,980
But I have no clue with this.

138
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,120
How can a Grade 2 math question
be so hard?

139
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,710
Read it again.

140
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,480
Should I ask Daddy?

141
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,880
Daddy?

142
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,460
He probably won't know
more than me.

143
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,490
Come eat!

144
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,220
'Young-su has 9 pencils

145
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,670
and Jin-hee has 3.'

146
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,240
'How can they have the same
number of pencils?'

147
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,900
'Write your answer.'

148
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,670
So? What did you write?

149
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,280
Nothing.

150
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,740
Why?

151
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,610
Just add 9 and 3 together,

152
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,550
then divide by 2.

153
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,060
It's not that easy!

154
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,490
Think Young-su is Young-seok.

155
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,390
And Jin-hee is me.

156
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,930
Young-seok?

157
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:44,440
There's no way
Young-seok would give the pencils.

158
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,100
For us to have the same,

159
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,870
he'd have to give me 3 pencils.

160
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,170
There's no way

161
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,410
he'd ever give me anything!

162
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,880
That's not the answer!

163
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,750
Dong-hoon, say something.

164
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,160
Listen to your mom.

165
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,350
Don't start fighting with her.

166
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,070
Spicy noodles give me ulcers.

167
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,640
- Don't eat it, then!
- I didn't say I won't.

168
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,470
Forget it.
Go watch baseball!

169
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,240
I'll raise Hope by myself.

170

I'm so sleepy.
What if I forget?

340
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,980
It's okay.

341
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,880
The police say they almost caught him.

342
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,920
- Really?
- Yes!

343
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,490
When you get a good rest...

344
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,590
Daddy and the cops
will have caught him.

345
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,070
So go to sleep, Sweetie.

346
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,140
Okay, Daddy.

347
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,780
My throat feels dry.

348
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,340
And I feel like I'll go poo.

349
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,360
Yes, sir.

350
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,760
Yes, Chief.

351
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,480
Results came for the fingerprints
found at the scene.

352
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,870
Did they find him?
Arrest him?

353
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,580
We found a match from the ex-cons

354
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,810
and located his whereabouts.

355
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,520
Why aren't you arresting him!

356
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,720
Constable LEE!

357
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,130
Why did you bring him here?

358
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,560
Have a seat, sir.

359
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,200
Who's the bastard?

360
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,770
Where does he live?

361
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,370
I'm not allowed
to give you any details.

362
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,810
You got his prints!

363
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,440
You know who he is!

364
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,880
But we can't arrest him
with just his fingerprints.

365
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,450
He's here? Who is it?

366
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,880
There's not enough evidence.

367
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,390
I can't arrest him without a warrant.

368
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,520
Why can't you get a warrant!

369
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,790
Sir?

370
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,230
The fingerprints could be
from anyone passing through.

371
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,200
We need more definitive
evidence for a warrant.

372
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,240
What more evidence do you need!

373
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:52,210
Like surveillance cam footages or DNA.

374
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,250
There were no cams at the scene
and no DNA yet.

375
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:02,290
If the victim testifies

376
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,380
and identifies him...

377
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,960
we won't need a warrant.

378
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,400
Testify?

379
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,530
Then, can you arrest him now?

380
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,800
She can't get investigated like that.

381
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,800
It's just testifying.

382
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,500
Whatever! She's your child!

383
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,840
You want her to recall
that horrific day?

384
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,650
You call yourself a father?

385
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,650
Don't you have any feelings?

386
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,850
Feelings?

387
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,290
Fine. Let's say I don't.

388
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,230
Ma'am?

389
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,190
Sunflower Center helps
sexually abused children.

390
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,240
They help children
deal with the trauma.

391
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,310
Why did this happen
to our little girl?

392
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,280
If only cops watched
the bastards better...

393
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,580
why would this happen!

394
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,280
Sit down.

395
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,420
We have to get that bastard!

396
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,460
Please calm down.

397
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,090
How can we!

398
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,030
Please go home and bring

399
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,300
her toys and journals.

400
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,710
What?

401
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,810
That's what the therapist asked for.

402
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
I'll try to convince your wife.

403
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,090
<i>KOKOMONG</i>

404
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,270
Must you do this now?

405
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,340
We have to catch the culprit.

406
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,010
It's only been three days.

407
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,580
She's psychologically unstable.

408
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,750
Are you sure?

409
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,590
It'll be the same no matter when.

410
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,650
It's not easy for her.

411
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,600
I won't do it
without the parents' consent.

412
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,780
Hope...

413
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,150
asked to catch the culprit.

414
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,990
Are you sure about this?

415
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,720
Yes...

416
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,770
Sweetie?

417
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,160
Can you talk?

418
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,410
You don't want to?

419
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,890
Then, you can just nod.

420
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,820
Can you see me?

421
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,290
Kokomong, the sausage

422
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,590
Silly, playful Kokomong

423
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,270
I'm pretty, aren't I?

424
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
As you see...

425
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,390
IM Hope can state opinions

426
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,250
and is clearly conscious.

427
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,060
Sweetie?

428
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,960
It rained a lot that day, right?

429
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,840
You met a bad man on the way

430
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,600
to school and had a close call?

431
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,520
About the bad man...

432
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,020
Think you can tell me?

433
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,570
Hope?

434
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,280
Is this the man?

435
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,450
What makes you think
this is him?

436
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,610
The face...

437
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,720
Eyes...

438
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,560
Mouth...

439
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,890
Really?

440
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,860
Just in case...

441
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,300
Can you choose
from other pictures, too?

442
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,300
Hope?

443
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,550
Can you point him out again?

444
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,320
Hope? Can we give it another try?

445
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,920
Good girl.

446
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,850
As time goes,
she could behave differently.

447
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,220
She could suddenly start screaming...

448
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,750
Or not talk at all.

449
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,950
What do you mean?

450
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,070
She needs both physical
and emotional healing.

451
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,030
It may be hard
with just the family's help.

452
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:09,340
The whole family
may all need treatment, too.

453
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,780
<i>SUNFLOWER CENTER</i>

454
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,540
Call me.

455
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,190
What are you doing?

456
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,790
Don't scare us with things

457
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,480
that didn't even happen!

458
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,990
What's with you?

459
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,680
If you're done,
I suggest you leave.

460
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,920
Who is it?

461
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,780
I came to get the dishes.

462
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,390
I left them outside.

463
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,290
I don't see them.
Where?

464
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,260
Of course they're there!

465
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,910
- Freeze!
- The hell!

466
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,640
Must we do this?

467
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,680
Not the 6 patients' room.

468
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,520
We don't have a choice.

469
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,220
Yes, Constable LEE.

470
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,990
Yes.

471
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:41,230
Thank you.

472
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,820
I'd better go to the police.

473
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,540
Did they catch him?

474
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,850
I'll be back.

475
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,920
Chief!

476
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,180
Chief!

477
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,020
Chief!

478
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,320
Sir!
You can't come here!

00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,930
Let me in!

Chief!

481
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,770
Why did he come here?

482
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,370
Let me in!

483
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,670
- You can't, sir!
- Let me in!

484
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,240
Wait!

485
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,470
- Let me see his face!
- Sir!

486
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,670
Are you the victim's father?

487
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,680
Sir! An interview, please!

488
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,180
Sir!

489
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,930
Police arrested a man for abducting

490
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,930
and raping an 8 year-old girl.

491
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,000
The girl was found with wounds

492
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,800
and intestinal ruptures.

493
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,800
She survived a major surgery
and is hospitalized.

494
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,630
Oh no...

495
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,340
This can't get out

496
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,940
all over the news!

497
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,770
Poor Hope!

498
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,710
Quiet! The kids will hear!

499
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:08,950
Young-seok, go in!

500
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,790
CHOI abducted a girl

501
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,550
on the morning of the 19th...

502
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,600
dragged her to a construction site
and raped her.

503
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,360
The victim's identification

504
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,060
of the culprit led to the arrest.

505
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,240
Hello?

506
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:31,470
I heard he got caught.
Where are you?

507
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,250
The hospital is on TV and everything!

508
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,440
Is Hope okay?

00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,340
CHOI abducted a girl

510
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:44,180
close from the school...

511
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,690
took her to a nearby place
and assaulted her.

512
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:53,730
CHOI lives less than 1 km away

513
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,030
from the victim's house.

514
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:04,410
He was recently released
from prison on the same charges.

515
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,340
Hear about the child rape case?

516
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,680
The girl was just 8 years-old.

517
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,910
I heard she's in this hospital.

518
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,690
Are you out of your mind!

519
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,760
You got her to testify for this?

520
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,520
We're moving her!

521

- Are you the father?
- How did she testify?

526
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,090
No! Stop!

Daddy?

529
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,520
Did I do something wrong?

530
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:25,180
Of course not.

531
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,900
- Is Hope okay?
- Come here!

532

It's all right.

00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,520
Her breathing is unstable!

551
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,320
The respirator!

552
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,750
- She's bleeding.
- Saline!

553
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,560
Her heartbeat is too high!

554
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:24,470
I was going to tell you.

555
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:31,820
After what happened to Hope,
I lost track.

556

Are you mad?

557
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,390
Why?

558
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,630
How can you not tell me
for 5 months?

559

By chance...

560
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:00,600
were you not going to give birth?

561
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:03,510
They said the baby's fine.

She can't come by often.

You said you wanted
a sibling, right?

There's a little brother
or sister in Mommy's tummy.

569
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,290
Know what that means?

Be honest.

If it's cuz of money...

597
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,200
I got some cash set aside
my wife doesn't know about.

You can use it.

599

You helped out a lot last year

600
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,710
when my mother-in-law died.

601

Fool! Don't say that!

Are you threatening me?

618
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,660
You should talk.

619
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,120
Threatening me
with the unborn baby?

620
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,790
What?

621
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,330
My kid's hurt.

00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:57,830

thinks she can run around.

Didn't eat anything, did you?

when I called that morning...

628
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,440
that I knew everything
and called on purpose?

629
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,050
That if I told even one person...

630
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,280
you'd rip my mouth off?

631
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,990
I guess word travels fast.

632
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,920
I didn't say I'd rip it off.

633
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,530
I said I could rip it off.

634
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,110
Trying to act strong...

635
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,680
you couldn't even cry, could you?

636
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,240

on the day of the arrest.

678
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:58,470
Objection!

679
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,010
The defendant just claims to have
lost and found them.

680
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,440
There is no evidence to support that.

681
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,410
Is there evidence to prove it?

682
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,880
We're searching, Your Honor.

683
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:11,690
We'll ask the construction workers

684
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:13,620
and find proof.

685
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,520
Then, present it when you find it.

686
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,360
The next hearing will be
at 3:00 PM on September 25th.

687
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,060
Court is adjourned.

688
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,200
You bastard!

689
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:31,170
You call yourself human!

690
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,040
After what you did to her!
You bastard!

691
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,610
You don't remember?

692
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:41,150
You son of a bitch!

693
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,550
Memorized your moves?

694
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,520
Yes, I did!

695
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:49,830
Me, too!

696
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,860
But I can't.

697
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,430
Don't worry.

698
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,330
If you miss anything,
I'll jump right in.

699
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,730
Ready?

700
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,370
It's okay if you make mistakes.
Just make big moves.

701
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:02,910
One at a time.

702
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,630
Hello, everyone!

703
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,700
I'm Kokomong!

704
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,400
Let's invent something
great today, too!

705
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:37,830
Hello? I'm pretty Aromi!

706
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:40,710
Why am I so beautiful?

707
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,080
Tada!

708
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,080
I'm Kero!

709
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,190
Want to see the new dance I made?

710
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:58,860
All our friends are here.
What will happen today?

711
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,790
Let's go to Refrigerator Land!

712
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:11,640
Let's roll together!

713
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:18,520
Let's gather together!
Kokomong is calling!

714
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,110
It's time for fun!

715
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,980
- It'll be fun!
- It'll be fun!

716
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,820
Let's roll together!
Hurray!

717
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,360
Let's gather together!
Hurray! Hurrah!

718
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:35,860
Hold Kokomong's hand
and run like the wind!

719
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,570
Kokomong! Kokomong!

720
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,210
I love Kokomong!

721
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,310
Today and tomorrow

722
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:50,150
Let's play together every day!

723
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,480
Let's roll together!
Hurray!

724
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,990
Let's gather together!
Hurray! Hurrah!

725
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:03,430
Hold Kokomong's hand
and run like the wind!

726
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:11,970
Hey!

727
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:13,760
How did the trial go?

728
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,030
There's no result
on the first day.

729
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,210
- When's the next trial?
- A month later.

730
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,070
What are you doing with this on?

731
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:23,910
Can't you tell?

732
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,720
Thought you hated that therapist.

733
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,750
Who cares?
When she'll help my child...

734
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:37,730
Young-seok's Mom!

735
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,320
- You came?
- Yes.

736
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,700
When you're done drinking,
go trade with the egg.

737
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:44,700
Okay.

738
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,640
Water, please.

739
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,610
- You came?
- Yes.

740
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,050
You, too?

741
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,940
Ah, yes...

742
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,220
I spent the whole day
with the sisters.

743
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,860
Sisters?

744
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:09,890
Yes! Sisters!

745
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:15,360
Women fight easily
and get close easily.

746
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:16,600
I see...

747
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:20,640
My role is kind of important.
I'd better go back in.

748
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,210
- Of course.
- Bye.

749
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,520
Aromi!

750
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:44,260
Kokomong!

751
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,590
Eat lots.

752
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,570
Drawing pictures and compliments

753
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,070
won't open up her heart.

754
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:58,970
Kids relieve stress by laughing

755
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,210
and playing till they sweat.

756
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:07,950
It's $19 an hour per costume
for 2 hours.

757
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,150
You borrowed 4 costumes.

758
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:12,920
So, it comes to $152.

759
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,260
One helper costs $10 per hour.

760
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,900
So for two hours that's $80.

761
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,160
But since the ladies helped.
It comes to $172.

762
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,390
Just give us $150.

763
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,200
Why does it cost so much?

764
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,600
It's all for a good cause.

765
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,450
- It's $150.
- Right...

766
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,420
Do you take Visa?

767
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,450
- Visa?
- Yes.

768
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,330
Sure.

769
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:55,260
Here you are.

770
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:02,000
How much is it to borrow this
for the day?

771
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,000
It's $70 for the day.

772
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:09,670
For a week it's $350.

773
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,810
- Well...
- Yes?

774
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:15,820
Can you give a discount?

775
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:18,010
Or accept installments?

776
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,420
- Installments?
- Yes.

777
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,560
Hold on!

778
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:32,200
This is kind of old.

779
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,140
We don't use it much.

780
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,000
So?

781
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,440
Just use it and give it back later.

782
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:50,080
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

783
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,850
Cheer up, sir.

784
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,060
- Thank you!
- Sure!

785
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,420
Thank you!

786
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,870
My daughter...

787
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:14,910
experienced the same thing as Hope.

788
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:20,640
When she was sixteen,
she committed suicide.

789
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,820
That same year...

790
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:31,490
I drove my car into the river to die.

791
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,930
As you can see...

792
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,770
I just lost my legs.

793
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,570
And I'm still alive like this.

794
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,110
The man who did that
to my daughter...

795
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,750
is still alive and roaming free.

796
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,120
Can you sleep well?

797
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,430
You don't look good.

798
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,460
I can't sleep much.

799
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,800
5 months?

800
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,100
6 months?

801
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:20,670
It's due in November.

802
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,590
<i>MY FRIENDS WENT HOME</i>

803
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,450
<i>REFRIGERATOR LAND?</i>

804
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,120
<i>YOU GO HOME, TOO</i>

805
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:57,600
<i>YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING</i>

806
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:32,830
Now that Hope is eating,

807
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,170
<i>YOUR FRIENDS ARE WAITING</i>

808
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,700
Now.

809
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:41,030
I'm going to ask some questions.

810
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:43,840
And you answer, okay Hope?

811
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,070
Good!

812
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,840
Let's put one on
since you answered.

813
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,790
Want me to put one first?

814
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:06,860
You're not talking much these days?

815
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,060
Hope?

816
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,370
Can you talk today?

817
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:26,240
Would you like to put one on?

818
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:36,430
This is the night sky.

819
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:40,590
When the night sky
gets filled with butterflies...

820
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:45,030
Hope will be able to speak again.

821
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:48,140
And sleep well again.

822
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,910
And also be able
to solve hard math problems.

823
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:55,240
Isn't that amazing?

824
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:01,610
Hope?

825
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,280
Then, can you write?

826
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,930
<i>YES</i>

827
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,070
Hope? What's today's date?

828
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,480
<i>AUGUST 24TH</i>

829
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,650
That's right!

830
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,350
So, you must be on summer break.

831
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,250
How many days till school starts?

832
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,070
3 days?

833
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:57,470
What do you want to do most
when school starts?

834
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,710
Can I go to school?

835
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:02,680
Of course!

836
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:13,220
<i>THAT'S A LIE</i>

837
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:16,990
Why do you think it's a lie?

838
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,320
Why do you think you can't go?

839
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,200
I'm embarrassed.

840
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,130
What are you embarrassed of?

841
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:38,210
<i>WHAT HAPPENED</i>

842
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:42,020
That day?

843
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:47,720
I'm not going to tell my friends.

844
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:55,400
You think they know or don't know?

845
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:57,590
I think they know.

846
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,240
Give me one.

847
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,010
I can have it all?

848
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:18,650
No changing minds!

849
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,120
Let's go.

850
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:21,690
See ya.

851
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,890
Where will you say you went
when you were away?

852
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,300
I thought...

853
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:37,310
I'll say I went to my cousin's
with my parents.

854
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:39,840
Or went on a trip.

855
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:47,310
If I don't explain well,
bad rumors could start.

856
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:07,040
<i>CLASSROOM RULES</i>

857
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:12,900
What didn't you like most
about being sick?

858
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,300
Missing school...

859
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:21,980
And my parent being unable
to go to work.

860
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,120
Spending lots of money...

861
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:38,960
<i>HOW TO TALK WITH</i>
<i>YOUR DAUGHTER</i>

862
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:46,640
The man asked me
to share my umbrella.

863
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:52,380
I thought of just leaving.

864
01:14:54,850 --> 01:15:00,190
But he was all wet in the rain
and I should share.

865
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,920
So, I did.

866
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:09,130
People say it's my fault
and don't say I did right.

867
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:15,800
Oh my!

868
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,070
Good job!

869
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:20,000
I'm beat!

870
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,910
Give it to me.

871
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:37,420
What do you want to do most
when you leave the hospital?

872
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,960
Go to school
and meet my friends.

873
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,730
And see the baby being born.

874
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:51,770
But I won't be able
to go to school...

875
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,410
and I'm worried
my homework isn't done.

876
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,250
When the baby's born,
I want to hold it...

877
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,360
But with this on...

878
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:16,700
I'm worried I'll get
dirty stuff all over the baby.

879
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:24,100
And what if my parents

880
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:28,650
only love the pretty baby?

881
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:31,540
<i>I'M SLEEPING.</i>
<i>COME AGAIN</i>

882
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,530
It's Kokomong!

883
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,240
Ever have a thought like this?

884
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:16,920
Hoping things will be like before
when you wake up...

885
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:21,890
Yesterday, I thought that.

886
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:27,660
I felt like things will go back
to normal, when I wake up.

887
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:33,800
So, I took all my pills.

888
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,470
And prayed before going to bed.

889
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,250
But when I woke up,
nothing changed.

890
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,230
How do you feel then, Hope?

891
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:05,500
Granny used to say
when she's frustrated...

892
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:11,680
'I'm gonna die!'

893
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:19,210
But now I think
I know what she meant.

894
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:28,200
'I'm gonna die'...
What do you think it means?

895
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,230
Why was I born?

896
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,570
Look, Hope! Isn't it pretty?

897
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,900
Blow it out!

898
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:21,420
- Congratulations, Hope!
- Thank you!

899
01:19:25,090 --> 01:19:30,550
We haven't been home so long,
I'm nervous.

900
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:32,130
Are you?

901
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:39,400
Can't we stay here?

902
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:40,840
Why?

903
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:45,600
Worried about going home?

904
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,750
Ready?

905
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,710
Finished paying?

906
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,820
Gwang-sik lent me his car.
Let's go.

907
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,450
Hope?

908
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,220
Wanna go down with Daddy?

909
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:17,830
I'll go first.

910
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,050
What's wrong?

911
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:58,640
Are you carsick?

912
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,080
- We're almost home.
- Okay.

913
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,960
It's okay, Hope.

914
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:17,090
We're here.

915
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:21,370
Take her in! Hurry!

916
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:23,830
Hope, let's go in.

917
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:26,080
That's good.

918
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,310
It's okay, Hope.

919
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,380
It's all right, Hope.

920
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:37,820
Hurry in!

921
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,650
Let's go.
We're home.

922
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:45,320
It's okay.
We're home.

923
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,230
Young-seok?
Came to see Hope?

924
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:52,890
Did Hope come home?

925
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:54,090
Sure.

926
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,130
Wanna see her?

927
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:01,630
No, I was just passing by
and wondered...

928
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:06,210
I heard you won't play with her

929
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,440
cuz she said your face is too big.

930
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,970
Aw, man!

931
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:13,050
Who says rumors like that?

932
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,020
Hope's Mom told me.

933
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:19,890
I'm going crazy...

934
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,420
Why?

935
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,700
What's the matter?

936
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:33,930
I came to walk to school
with her that day.

937
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:37,300
If we went together...

938
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,440
nothing would've happened.

939
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,280
What's with you, boy.

940
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,620
It's okay. Don't cry.

941
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,790
It's all right.

942
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:01,520
Want some candy?

943
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:06,390
Let's go inside!

944
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:11,100
Greet teachers respectfully.

945
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,040
Don't run in the hallways.

946
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,640
Book report due tomorrow.

947
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:26,010
Bring consent forms
for extracurricular activities.

948
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:29,920
I can take her there.

949
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:33,430
The baby's about to pop out.
I'll take her.

950
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,830
Let's put this on.

951
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,860
Good.

952
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:38,730
It's not that far.

953
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,200
Mom, I wanna go with Hope.

954
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,460
Hear that?

955
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:45,670
Heard that?

956
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:49,570
Okay, then.

957
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,840
We're all dressed and ready.

958
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,210
That's a good girl.

959
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:58,180
We're all set!

960
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,950
Mommy?
The crackling sound is too loud.

961
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,760
Are you worried about that?

962
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:27,600
If the colostomy bag ever
falls off or leaks...

963
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,040
please call me.

964
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,340
Of course.

965
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,520
And can she avoid

966
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:36,520
direct contact with male teachers?

967
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:39,950
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

968
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,920
The teachers will take caution.

969
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:45,550
Don't worry.

970
01:26:46,060 --> 01:26:50,760
Do you think the children
will make fun?

971
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:56,230
With you doing all this,
they'll all be good, too.

972
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,940
I'll come dressed

973
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,510
more suitably next time.

974
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:06,610
So sorry.

975
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:10,350
Take care.

976
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:12,850
I'll be going.

977
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,430
<i>WHAT IF THE BAD MAN</i>
<i>COMES AGAIN?</i>

978
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,430
<i>I'M SCARED.</i>
<i>I HOPE HE GETS PUNISHED.</i>

979
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,350
Isn't today your day off?

980
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:19,490
Oh no...

981
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,760
Hope didn't go to school?

982
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:25,030
Didn't I tell you?

983
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:27,090
We're seeing
the therapist today.

984
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,700
Oh, right...

985
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,620
Hang in there.

986
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:50,850
She says Hope is getting
a lot better.

987
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,280
I'm okay...

988
01:28:57,490 --> 01:28:59,430
How is Hope's father doing?

989
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,820
He leaves before Hope gets up.

990
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:09,830
I feel so sorry to him.

991
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,310
Worrying about him...

992
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,840
You've gotten a lot better.

993
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,650
Of all the kids in the world...

994
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:26,790
Why did this happen
to our little girl?

995
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:33,860
I wish the same thing happens
to all the kids in the world.

996
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:41,200
Then, Hope wouldn't stand out
and be in pain more.

997
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:44,700
And?

998
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:53,540
But after thinking like that...
I'd feel sorry to the baby.

999
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:03,220
This happened to Hope
because I'm so evil to the bone.

1000
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:08,260
I think.

1001
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:15,800
Whenever I clean
her colostomy bag...

1002
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:23,870
I'd wonder when it'll be over.

1003
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,580
Did her grandmother live with you?

1004
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:36,150
Yes.

1005
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:40,820
My mom lived with us
till she died last year.

1006
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:46,400
She used to say,
'I'm gonna die' all the time?

1007
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,840
How did you know?

1008
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:55,070
She said that when she moved
because of her arthritis.

1009
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:59,110
When I asked Hope
what she thought that meant...

1010
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:01,480
she thought for a while...

1011
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:08,560
and said it meant,
'Why was I born?'

1012
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,640
Hi, Young-seok.

1013
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:33,310
Hope can't walk fast,
so you go a step behind her, okay?

1014
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,250
- Okay.
- Good.

1015
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,680
I can go by myself...

1016
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:42,650
I'll walk behind you.

1017
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,800
Don't come near me.

1018
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,790
Fine. Go first.

1019
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:50,890
See you later.

1020
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,760
Thanks, Young-seok.

1021
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,870
Where are you off to again?
You should eat lunch!

1022
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:06,970
I'll be back!

1023
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:08,120
Where are you going?

1024
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,310
Somewhere!

1025
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:05,970
Hope?

1026
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,270
What's inside that bag?

1027
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,210
Why do you want to know?

1028
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:18,710
Want some candy?

1029
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,190
- Yes!
- Me, too!

1030
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:28,360
I gotta go home. Bye!

1031
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,430
- See you tomorrow!
- See you tomorrow!

1032
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:03,430
Hope!

1033
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:10,600
The Kokomong over there...

1034
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,170
Is that your new friend?

1035
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:21,210
Is it a boy or a girl?

1036
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:39,770
I have no idea.

1037
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,540
Kokomong is just Kokomong.

1038
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,270
Hope?

1039
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:51,540
I just want to say,
don't be sick.

1040
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:59,080
Sorry about before.

1041
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:04,990
We're still friends, right?

1042
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:08,090
Yup.

1043
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:09,490
See you tomorrow.

1044
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:18,670
Kokomong!

1045
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:38,190
You...

1046
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:49,940
Are you...

1047
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:55,300
Daddy?

1048
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:00,140
You're Daddy, right?

1049
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,650
Answer me!

1050
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:26,870
Is it because
I keep avoiding you, Daddy?

1051
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:36,710
Aren't you hot?

1052
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,090
Let's go home.

1053
01:37:08,350 --> 01:37:09,440
I'm home.

1054
01:37:09,550 --> 01:37:11,150
Hi, Hope!

1055
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:13,150
Oh my!

1056
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,390
What's this?

1057
01:37:17,230 --> 01:37:18,020
It's Daddy.

1058
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:27,460
Why you!
What are you doing in there?

1059
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:09,540
Mr. IM Dong-hoon?

1060
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:11,840
Registered mail!

1061
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:23,790
<i>SUBPOENA FOR IM HOPE</i>

1062
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:28,360
Why does Hope have to
go to court to testify?

1063
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:31,800
The Defense submitted Hope's

1064
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:33,560
psychological records as evidence.

1065
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:38,040
The judge said her testimony

1066
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:40,040
video is not reliable.

1067
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:44,240
It's going to kill her.

1068
01:38:44,450 --> 01:38:49,480
Still... If she doesn't testify now,
things could get worse.

1069
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:54,590
The sly bastard is claiming

1070
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,520
physical and mental weakness.

1071
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,020
What?

1072
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,130
He wrote petitions saying

1073
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,660
he can't remember when he's drunk.

1074
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,670
If that gets recognized...

1075
01:39:07,070 --> 01:39:11,200
he'll get 15 years maximum
or get off in just 8 or 9 years.

1076
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,340
Think it over, sir.

1077
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:19,540
If Hope testifies before the judge,

1078
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,910
he'll be cornered.

1079
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:32,130
<i>CORRECTIONAL CENTER</i>

1080
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,360
You sent...

1081
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,170
three petitions?

1082
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:44,740
Yes.

1083
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,870
I don't remember it.

1084
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:50,370
I'm frustrated, too.

1085
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,050
After what you did...

1086
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:55,940
how can you not remember?

1087
01:39:56,920 --> 01:40:00,860
Whenever I drink,
I can't remember.

1088
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:06,590
They force me to remember,
so my head hurts.

1089
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,590
Your head hurts?

1090
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:15,130
If I really did that, I deserve to die.

1091
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:21,930
Doing that to a kid
can't be human, but a damn pig.

1092
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:32,710
Did you come to settle?

1093
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:42,330
Settle?

1094
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,030
I would love to be able to settle.

1095
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,730
But I don't have anything.

1096
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:55,870
If I get out soon,
maybe I can make money.

1097
01:40:57,750 --> 01:41:00,550
You know what I mean?

1098
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:05,920
You went there!

1099
01:41:06,890 --> 01:41:08,190
You remember!

1100
01:41:08,890 --> 01:41:10,220
You know my daughter!

1101
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:13,660
Think I'd let you walk, bastard?

1102
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:18,260
Don't swear to me.

1103
01:41:21,170 --> 01:41:23,730
Wondered why she was so cheeky...

1104
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:26,300
Guess she takes after Daddy.

1105
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,410
Think wisely.

1106
01:41:32,350 --> 01:41:34,780
How long do you think
I'd be in here?

1107
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:38,620
I'll get out someday.

1108
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,390
So what!

1109
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:44,490
What will you do!

1110
01:41:48,030 --> 01:41:49,590
Come out! You bastard!

1111
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:51,230
Come here!

1112
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,790
My wife said...

1113
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:27,860
she wished the same thing
happened to all the kids.

1114
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:34,140
I thought that was
really bad of her.

1115
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:38,380
But now, I think that.

1116
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,050
I know how you feel.

1117
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,560
You can't.
You didn't go through it.

1118
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:49,090
Dong-hoon?

1119
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,820
Can you think differently?

1120
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,960
That it was an accident?

1121
01:42:56,830 --> 01:42:59,770
Like she was walking one day

1122
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:02,840
and got hit by a car.

1123
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:03,960
An accident.

1124
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:05,340
What?

1125
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:07,340
An accident?

1126
01:43:07,680 --> 01:43:12,480
Think of it that way
so your family can move on.

1127
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:16,450
Stop the car.

1128
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:18,290
Dong-hoon?

1129
01:43:18,420 --> 01:43:19,550
Stop the car!

1130
01:43:20,660 --> 01:43:21,560
Man...

1131
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:31,860
If it was your kid,
can you call it an accident?

1132
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,900
I need to walk...

1133
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,210
By chance...

1134
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:56,990
Did you take insurance on me?

1135
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:58,590
What insurance?

1136
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:00,720
Life insurance?

1137
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:03,160
Something like that...

1138
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:06,860
I have no intention
and no money.

1139
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:09,770
I'll work you like a dog forever!

1140
01:44:10,970 --> 01:44:13,570
In 10 years,
how old will Hope be?

1141
01:44:15,980 --> 01:44:17,070
Why?

1142
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:24,810
The bastard could get out
in 8 or 9 years.

1143
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:27,690
That's insane!

1144
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:31,190
Hope won't even be 20.

1145
01:44:35,130 --> 01:44:39,000
If the trial goes wrong...

1146
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:42,730
I'll deal with him on my own.

1147
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:47,740
You'll kill him or something?

1148
01:44:48,210 --> 01:44:50,910
Why not! I could!

1149
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:04,560
Since the Defense motioned against

1150
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:06,620
the victim's video testimony...

1151
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,590
I call IM Hope to the stand.

1152
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:22,510
Hope?

1153
01:45:23,410 --> 01:45:24,810
Do you know why you're here?

1154
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:29,280
Why did you come?

1155
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:34,660
To punish the bad man.

1156
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:38,760
Do you remember taking the video

1157
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:40,520
with the police in the hospital?

1158
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:44,230
Yes.

1159
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:46,500
You must've been in
a lot of pain then.

1160
01:45:47,300 --> 01:45:48,070
Yes.

1161
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:50,070
But you still remembered?

1162
01:45:50,670 --> 01:45:51,500
Yes.

1163
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:54,640
You saw pictures and

1164
01:45:54,710 --> 01:45:57,010
pointed out the bad man.

1165
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:02,740
Could you do that again?

1166
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:09,080
Hold your hand up
when his picture comes up.

1167
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:10,860
Yes.

1168
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:42,320
Hope?

1169
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:46,460
Is this the man?

1170
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:52,760
No more questions.

1171
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:59,970
Hope?

1172
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:04,010
On that day...

1173
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:07,780
can you tell me
what the man smelled like?

1174
01:47:09,990 --> 01:47:11,720
Did he smell like cigarettes?

1175
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,790
How about alcohol?

1176
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,060
Yes.

1177
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:22,830
How much?

1178
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,870
Did it smell a lot?

1179
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:41,380
No more questions.

1180
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:16,550
The defendant could not prove

1181
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,450
losing the shoes and vest.

1182
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:21,690
The victim's blood marked shoes

1183
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,060
and vest belong to the defendant.

1184
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:28,430
The defendant's fingerprints
were also found at the scene.

1185
01:48:29,260 --> 01:48:31,130
I never went there...

1186
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:34,800
All the evidence points to you.

1187
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:38,070
Although painful to recall,

1188
01:48:38,770 --> 01:48:40,440
the victim came and identified you.

1189
01:48:40,510 --> 01:48:41,530
Hope?

1190
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:43,880
Are you okay?

1191
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:45,170
I ask you one last time.

1192
01:48:46,150 --> 01:48:47,480
You really can't remember?

1193
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,780
Did I really go there?

1194
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:54,490
Do you accept the charges?

1195
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:56,220
Did I do it?

1196
01:48:57,260 --> 01:49:00,290
If I did, I deserve to die.

1197
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,590
I'll take due punishment.

1198
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:06,400
But I really don't remember anything.

1199
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:12,200
I submit evidence of

1200
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:15,280
the defendant's alcohol addiction.

1201
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:27,820
Defendant?
Make your final statement.

1202
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:33,620
I really don't remember anything.

1203
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,530
I'm innocent.

1204
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:39,960
Are you finished?

1205
01:49:40,770 --> 01:49:41,860
No, sir!

1206
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,230
Your Honor!

1207
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:47,510
I didn't do it.
I was too drunk.

1208
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,840
I don't remember anything.

1209
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,270
It's possible I didn't do it!

1210
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,440
I'm innocent.

1211
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:57,920
I'm wrongfully charged!

1212
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:08,260
Sexual assault case 2012-211.
I've reached a verdict.

1213
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:16,600
Defendant CHOI Jong-sool...

1214
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:22,200
brutally assaulted
a 9 year-old.

1215
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:25,510
Then, choked her and raped her.

1216
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,570
The assault is ruthless
to the point of torturing.

1217
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:32,280
Resulting from this...

1218
01:50:33,150 --> 01:50:35,120
the victim has been wounded

1219
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,560
with a permanent disability.

1220
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:43,120
He is responsible for scarring
the victim and family for life.

1221
01:50:44,430 --> 01:50:45,920
Also having a past record of abuse,

1222
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:50,730
he must be punished severely.

1223
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:53,410
However...

1224
01:50:54,380 --> 01:50:56,540
the defendant was intoxicated...

1225
01:50:57,250 --> 01:51:00,240
and his impaired state is recognized.

1226
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:05,450
Under the Act on Special Cases

1227
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:11,190
concerning sexual assault, Article 9...

1228
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:13,750
Article 7...

1229
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,990
and Article 14...

1230
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:20,700
He is sentenced to 12 years.

1231
01:51:20,770 --> 01:51:22,240
Just 12 years!

1232
01:51:26,110 --> 01:51:28,080
Information on the defendant

1233
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,140
will be made public for 5 years.

1234
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:38,190
And the request for the victim's
compensation is overruled.

1235
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:43,520
Wait!

1236
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:47,620
Why go easy on him
because he's drunk?

1237
01:51:48,830 --> 01:51:50,530
Then, drunk driving
shouldn't be charged!

1238
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:52,670
Drunk driving is wrong...

1239
01:51:52,830 --> 01:51:55,900
But you go easy on
almost killing a kid!

1240
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:01,470
You call this a trial!

1241
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:04,940
A child almost died.

1242
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:07,840
And she's our child.

1243
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:12,540
I'm here and her dad's here.

1244
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:15,620
And the one responsible is here.

1245
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:18,050
There's evidence, too!

1246
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:21,690
But just 12 years?

1247
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,250
Order!

1248
01:52:23,470 --> 01:52:26,160
Know how old she'll be
in just 12 years!

1249
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:30,760
Not even 20 years-old!

1250
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,220
Daddy!

1251
01:52:57,570 --> 01:53:00,930
Daddy, let's go home.

1252
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:20,620
Let's go home, please?

1253
01:53:41,580 --> 01:53:42,540
Let's go home.

1254
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,740
Let's go home...

1255
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,170
Let's go home...

1256
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:50,090
Get up.

1257
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:48,830
Here he comes.

1258
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,170
Oh my!

1259
01:55:51,370 --> 01:55:54,570
What a big boy!

1260
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:56,480
- Dad?
- Hmm?

1261
01:55:57,010 --> 01:55:58,600
His face is big, too.

1262
01:55:58,780 --> 01:56:01,580
Men should have big heads!

1263
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:06,720
But not as big as yours.

1264
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:11,220
Looks like
it's going to be big.

1265
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:13,530
Who named him?

1266
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:18,030
I named Hope.
Mi-hee named him.

1267
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:20,500
What is it?

1268
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:21,870
Happy.

1269
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:24,860
IM Happy?

1270
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:27,380
Yup. IM Happy.

1271
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,610
Happy? Look here!

1272
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,140
He's looking at us.

1273
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,310
- Isn't he smart?
- Why you.

1274
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:45,150
<i>The Loneliest person</i>
<i>is the kindest</i>

1275
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,020
<i>The Saddest person</i>
<i>smiles the Brightest</i>

1276
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,790
<i>because They don't want others</i>
<i>to feel the same pain</i>

1277
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:50,460
<i>- Anonymous -</i>

1278
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:54,760
I felt like I needed to go home

1279
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:59,640
and left after second period.

1280
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:05,210
My friends may think
it was weird.

1281
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:09,550
What should I say on Monday?

1282
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:13,990
I'm worried about that.

1283
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:18,820
I wish I wasn't sick.

1284
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:24,090
Throw it to third!

1285
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:25,600
Get him!

1286
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:29,100
You worked all night?
Aren't you sleeping?

1287
01:57:30,070 --> 01:57:31,630
I'll watch this, then sleep.

1288
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:36,510
Yelling at a rerun!

1289
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,770
They're making me tired.

1290
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:50,060
I made an airplane today.

1291
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:55,490
I made it for my brother.
It looks great.

1292
01:57:56,660 --> 01:58:02,900
I'm good at making
and fixing things like Daddy.

1293
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:09,000
If that fool didn't make
an error, it'd be over!

1294
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:13,150
Go Lotte!

1295
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,440
Give up on Lotte.

1296
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:20,150
What! They're winning!

1297
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:24,030
But they lost 7 to 8.

1298
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:27,380
Don't tell me that!

1299
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:30,560
Do you have to tell me now!

1300
01:58:32,270 --> 01:58:33,700
Man! I can't sleep now!

1301
01:58:55,490 --> 01:58:58,650
You being born is a blessing.
