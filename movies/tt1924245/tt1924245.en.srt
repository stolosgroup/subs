3
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,443
It's 10:30, Mike.

4
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,903
You're late.

5
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,280
For what?

6
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:32,201
Okay. All right.

7
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,496
Back when we had winners,

8
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,999
I was afraid to lose you
to the competition.

9
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,376
Five times you won
the All-American Futurity

10
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,253
and every goddamn time
I thought,

11
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:44,380
"Oh, I won't be able
to keep Mike.

12
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:47,216
Somebody's gonna grab him."

13
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,052
But that was a long time ago,
wasn't it?

14
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,431
Yeah. That was before
the accident.

15
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,142
Before the pills.

16
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,104
Before the booze.

17
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,067
You look out there
in that barn now,

18
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,528
a string
of second-rate horses.

19
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:11,574
Kind of like my trainer,
isn't it?

20
00:03:11,657 --> 00:03:14,911
I'm not afraid of losing you
to anybody now.

21
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,871
You're a loss to no one.

22
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,625
It's time for new blood.

23
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:27,506
Yeah, I can see that.

24
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,884
And you know
what you're late for?

25
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,135
What?

26
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,845
Clearing out your locker.

27
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,097
Why don't you do that
on the way out?

28
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,812
You gonna say anything?

29
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:45,024
No.

30
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:46,984
I was just gonna say, "Howard,

31
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,987
I've always thought of you
as a small, weak,

32
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:52,531
and gutless man."

33
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:56,244
But, you know,
there's no reason to be rude.

34
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,211
So, you don't lock your doors?

35
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,049
Ain't got nothing
worth stealing.

36
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:38,888
What's up?

37
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,475
You're just killing time
in here or what?

38
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,186
You look awful.

39
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,231
Well, you've looked horrible
longer, so I guess you win.

40
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,026
Yeah.

41
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,364
What do you want?

42
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,785
You remember I had a son?

43
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:01,911
Rafael.

44
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:04,955
Yeah.

45
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,085
That's him,
like, at five or six.

46
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,670
{\an5}Well, he's 13 now,
and I wanna get him out of Mexico.

47
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,547
I wanna get him up here.
I wanna do the right thing.

48
00:06:13,631 --> 00:06:15,299
I want him to live with me.

49
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,177
What does his mother think
about that?

50
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:22,306
Yeah, well, Leta,

51
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,934
- she's a nutcase.
- Oh.

52
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,062
I mean, she was fun
at a party, but...

53
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,523
and she gave me him.

54
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah.

55
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,153
But he's in trouble.
Mike, the kid's in trouble.

56
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,114
And I gotta get him
out of there.

57
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,283
Yeah. Why don't you call
the authorities, then?

58
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,452
I can't go to the authorities.

59
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,664
I have legal issues.
I can't go back into Mexico.

60
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,542
He's being abused.

61
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,252
How do you know that?

62
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:52,920
Well, I don't know it
directly from him,

63
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:54,130
if that's what
you're asking me,

64
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,173
but I know that.

65
00:06:56,257 --> 00:06:57,925
I know it
from people around her,

66
00:06:58,008 --> 00:06:59,468
and she's a mess.

67
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:01,846
And she's letting the kid
be abused.

68
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:05,141
Uh... Well, I don't know
what you want from me

69
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:07,268
'cause, you know...

70
00:07:07,351 --> 00:07:09,478
{\an5}You want me to go down
there and kidnap him?

71
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,855
Bring him out of there?

72
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:13,357
It's not kidnapping
if he's your kid.

73
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:14,817
It isn't my kid,

74
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,944
so I don't think he'll go
with me in the first place.

75
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:20,406
Yes, he would.
He'll listen to you, Mike.

76
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,116
I know he will.

77
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,576
He'll know
the minute he sees you,

78
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:24,994
you're a real cowboy.

79
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,912
He'll listen to you.
Tell him about the house.

80
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:29,039
Tell him he's gonna have
the run of the whole ranch.

81
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:32,126
He's gonna have his own horse.
Tell him that.

82
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,296
It's every boy's dream.

83
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,176
Well, I think you got dozens
of guys here who could do it

84
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,844
and I'm not really the kind...

85
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:44,555
You know what?
You owe me, Mike.

86
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:47,725
I was standing here,
looking at all this,

87
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:51,437
{\an5}thinking about making the
payments on this place for you.

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,440
About helping you not lose it
after you...

89
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,151
After you lost her
and the boy...

90
00:07:57,234 --> 00:08:00,696
You know how many people
told me to stop doing that?

91
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,698
To just cut you loose.

92
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,951
I said, "No. You know what?
I owe Mike that much."

93
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:08,871
But I think you owe me
a little bit,

94
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:10,956
and you gave me your word.

95
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,501
And that used to
mean something, Mike.

96
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,295
Yeah.

97
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:19,048
I owe ya.

98
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,134
All right.

99
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,553
There's cash
in this envelope.

100
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,681
Quite a bit of cash
for travel and expenses.

101
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:29,058
I've got her address on here

102
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,601
and this is a map of the area

103
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,770
in Mexico City
she's living in.

104
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:38,734
That's Rafo,
like I said, about six.

105
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:43,656
He's 13 nearly now,
and he's gonna be taller.

106
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:46,909
- Thank you.
- Okay.

107
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,928
<i>Buenos dias,</i> girls.

108
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,805
- Hello.
- Hi.

109
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,265
So, where are you headed?

110
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,517
Playa.
We're gonna hit the beach.

111
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:15,396
Which beach?

112
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,816
I mean, there are many
beautiful beaches in Mexico.

113
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,442
However many we can in a week.

114
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,987
I bet you will.

115
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:27,241
Enjoy your stay
in Mexico, girls.

116
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:29,118
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

117
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,795
What's your purpose
for entering Mexico?

118
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:42,339
Uh, a holiday.

119
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:44,717
Can I see your paperwork?

120
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,595
I'm actually with them.

121
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,765
Just you?

122
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,143
Just me.

123
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,811
Enjoy your stay in Mexico.

124
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,104
Thank you.

125
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:19,895
Why the hell would a kid
ever wanna leave this place?

126
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:12,322
Hey, be respectful, old man.

127
00:12:12,406 --> 00:12:13,574
Take off your hat.

128
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,850
Usually
when a woman laughs like that,

129
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,643
a man's fly is open.

130
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,772
That's the only thing
that's not on the table.

131
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:49,401
You're good.

132
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,992
Aw. Oh, no.

133
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:07,961
Is this your family,
Michael Milo?

134
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:13,175
Yeah. From a long time ago.

135
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:14,301
Hmm.

136
00:13:15,469 --> 00:13:18,096
You also have a picture
of my son

137
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,266
from a long time ago.

138
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,768
I can explain that.

139
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:25,395
No, you needn't.

140
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:28,774
You think you're the first
my ex-husband sent?

141
00:13:31,276 --> 00:13:33,529
The first one is in jail.

142
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,948
Beastly man
with no manners.

143
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:39,409
The second
was more amiable.

144
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:43,956
Couldn't find Rafo and left.

145
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,377
Tell me, cowboy,

146
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,880
why does his father
really want him now?

147
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,758
He has no real love
for the boy.

148
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:58,095
Well, maybe he's trying
to change all that.

149
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:01,765
You're picturing
some innocent kid.

150
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:04,768
Like in that photo.

151
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:06,103
A nice, respectful boy

152
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:08,730
who wears clean clothes
to school,

153
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,525
and sings in church.

154
00:14:12,776 --> 00:14:15,529
I guarantee you
that isn't the case.

155
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,408
My son is wild.

156
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,494
An animal
who lives in the gutter.

157
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:27,249
Gambling, stealing,
cockfighting, at the...

158
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,294
At the <i>calle Choca.</i>

159
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:34,798
Take him.

160
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:37,175
Take him
if you can find him.

161
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,928
He's a monster.

162
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,434
You have made a long trip
for nothing.

163
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,440
I don't know
where my son is now.

164
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,775
He's like his father.

165
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,194
He runs away.

166
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,406
He hates his father.

167
00:14:59,489 --> 00:15:01,325
He hates me.

168
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,121
So, go home, Mr. Mike.

169
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:08,707
Go home.

170
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:12,419
When did you give up?

171
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,341
No matter what people say,

172
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:19,927
some aren't cut out
to be parents.

173
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:27,726
Have a drink with me, hmm?

174
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:40,197
No, I got a job to do.

175
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:45,744
Well, then, good luck.
You'll need it.

176
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,791
Hey, Rafo.

177
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,276
Oh, shit!

178
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:01,528
Shit, shit.

179
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:36,271
Hey, Rafo,
you can come out now.

180
00:17:36,354 --> 00:17:37,731
The cops are gone.

181
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:41,443
Where the hell are you?

182
00:17:46,948 --> 00:17:48,450
You can come out now.

183
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,368
I'm a friend of the family.

184
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,957
Okay. Come on.

185
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,667
Come here.

186
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,212
Hey, hey, come on.

187
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:02,547
Chicken...

188
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,841
Bad chicken.
No, no! Hey, hey!

189
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:05,967
Ah.

190
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,347
All right,
you little bastard.

191
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,057
Come on out.

192
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,310
I'm gonna count to five.

193
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:17,687
I'm gonna
wring this chicken's neck.

194
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:20,190
You got that?

195
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,317
One.

196
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,735
Two.

197
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,237
Three.

198
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,696
Four.

199
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,907
- Give me my rooster!
- Five.

200
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,701
Not until we talk, Rafo.

201
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,036
You know my name?

202
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,205
How did you find me?

203
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,124
I found you
because your mother told me

204
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,000
where you were.
That's why.

205
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:42,629
If she sold me to you,
you're a fool.

206
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:45,215
Touch me and I'll kick
your ass, old man.

207
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,883
What the hell
you talking about?

208
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,094
You are some perverted friend
of my mother

209
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,138
from one of her parties.

210
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:53,014
Perverted old man.

211
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,351
Hey. You're talking
to the wrong person.

212
00:18:56,434 --> 00:19:00,021
I'm here representing your dad
who wants to see you.

213
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,399
Howard Polk.

214
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,528
I work for him, that's all.

215
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,489
You are a cowboy?
A ranch hand?

216
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:11,575
Yeah.

217
00:19:11,658 --> 00:19:15,078
That's right.
I've done a little of that.

218
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:18,290
Okay, talk.

219
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,167
Not here.

220
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,502
Not here.

221
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,886
You're joking, yes?

222
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,305
No, not joking.

223
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,849
My father, he wants me.

224
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,809
Well, you're his only kid.

225
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:40,270
And he sent you for me?

226
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,438
Yep.

227
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,564
You're a liar.

228
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:45,400
My father hasn't seen me
for years.

229
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,652
Why does he want
to see me now?

230
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,238
Well, he wants to see you,
that's all.

231
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,616
He, uh... He misses you.

232
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,036
You're full of shit.

233
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,412
My father doesn't want me.

234
00:19:57,495 --> 00:19:59,164
He never even called
on my birthdays.

235
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,290
Look at that.

236
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,461
It's me when I was little.

237
00:20:04,544 --> 00:20:06,755
Yeah, that's it.

238
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,173
Same guy.

239
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,425
He gave you that?

240
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:11,509
He did.

241
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:17,432
If my father wants me back,
why didn't he telephone?

242
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:20,060
He sent you,
some <i>apestoso viejo.</i>

243
00:20:20,143 --> 00:20:23,897
I don't know what that means,
but I don't like it.

244
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,273
When I was little,

245
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,901
my father said he would
give me a special horse.

246
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:32,197
He never did.

247
00:20:33,573 --> 00:20:35,283
He's a liar.

248
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,285
Eh, just a little late,
that's all.

249
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,120
That doesn't mean he's a liar.

250
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,581
But he's gonna
make it up to you now.

251
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,166
He's got a big ranch.

252
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,001
He's got horses, cattle.

253
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:46,628
In fact,
he's got hundreds of horses.

254
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:49,005
You'll be able
to ride yourself silly.

255
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:51,007
- Hundreds of horses?
- Yeah.

256
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:53,551
Even owns a rodeo up there.

257
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,304
Rodeo?

258
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,973
Hundreds of horses...

259
00:20:58,598 --> 00:20:59,975
He's a big boss!

260
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:02,936
Yeah, he's a big boss.
That's what I'm telling you.

261
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,020
Maybe I'll go.

262
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:05,146
- Just for a while.
- Yeah.

263
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,815
Good. Good, I think so.

264
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,525
If I don't like it,
I will say,

265
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:09,818
"To hell with him,"
and come back.

266
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,278
Yeah, that's right.

267
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,613
If you don't like it,
to hell with it.

268
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,700
Okay. Deal.

269
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,118
I can bring my rooster?

270
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,453
Yeah. I don't see why not.

271
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:22,706
Hey, Macho, come.

272
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,167
Where ya going?

273
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,669
I have to get my things.

274
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,671
No, stay here.

275
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:33,925
Shit.

276
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,883
What can I say?

277
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,844
I can't believe it.

278
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,722
Where did you find him?

279
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:23,558
Right where you said.

280
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:25,560
At the cock fights.

281
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,439
And where is he?

282
00:22:29,522 --> 00:22:32,233
He said he was gonna go out
and get his stuff.

283
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,070
You poor fool.

284
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:39,574
Yeah.

285
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,201
- Ah.
- Well...

286
00:22:41,284 --> 00:22:43,119
This time...

287
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:45,955
This time
you'll have a drink with me.

288
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:56,716
Ah... you really thought
Rafo would go with you, hmm?

289
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,719
Mm, maybe he will.

290
00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:06,976
Here.

291
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,063
Cheers.

292
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:20,448
Hmm. Come. Let's celebrate.

293
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,663
Hmm.

294
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:29,499
Tell me something...

295
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,799
What are we celebrating?

296
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,052
Anything.

297
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,431
I'm up for anything.

298
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,683
<i>Corazon.</i>

299
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:56,734
Uh...

300
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:58,403
I, uh...

301
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,614
I don't know.

302
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:05,160
I think I better
get the hell out of here.

303
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,538
Otherwise, this job
ain't gonna be finished.

304
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,457
You dare...

305
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,168
You dare insult me
in my own home?

306
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,544
No, I didn't mean
to insult you.

307
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,546
I just...

308
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:17,964
Okay.

309
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,674
Hey.

310
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:22,719
You think I'm a whore?
Is that what you think?

311
00:24:24,804 --> 00:24:27,348
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Don't go!

312
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:31,019
One more step
and you're finished.

313
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,271
I'll call the <i>Federales</i>
right now.

314
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:34,606
Give them your name,

315
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,524
and you'll be arrested
for kidnapping.

316
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,985
{\an5}And spend the rest of your
life in a Mexican prison.

317
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:41,196
How do you like that?

318
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,364
You don't like that, do you?

319
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:47,285
Rafo is mine.

320
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:50,121
He's mine and he stays.

321
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:51,498
You understand?

322
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:55,627
He's my property,
and nobody takes my property.

323
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,879
His father ran away from us.

324
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:01,883
He had his chance,
but he left us here.

325
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:04,636
He left him with me.

326
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,347
You have exactly five minutes

327
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,224
to get in your vehicle
and leave Mexico City.

328
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,808
Do we understand each other?

329
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:12,435
Get out.

330
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,230
Get out now.

331
00:25:16,773 --> 00:25:18,608
- Lucas.
- Take him out.

332
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,380
Okay.

333
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,416
The hell?

334
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,918
Hello, <i>gringo.</i>

335
00:26:19,002 --> 00:26:21,588
I guess I fell asleep, yes?

336
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:22,672
Get out.

337
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,382
What?

338
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,926
Get out.

339
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:32,890
- Get out.
- What?

340
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,225
Get out, I said.

341
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,020
What?

342
00:26:37,687 --> 00:26:38,855
What the...

343
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:40,565
I said, out.

344
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:43,026
Get out, you're not going.

345
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:45,320
{\an5}- Say who?
- Says me. Says your mother.

346
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,323
{\an5}- I'm going with you.
- No, you're not going with me.

347
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,283
I said I am going.

348
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:51,659
You're staying.

349
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,286
If you go without me,
do you know what I'll do?

350
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:55,330
- What'll you do?
- I'll go to the police.

351
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,623
- Yeah?
- Not here.

352
00:26:56,706 --> 00:26:58,499
In the next town
where they don't know me.

353
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,085
I'll go to the <i>Federales</i>
and I'll tell them

354
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:04,922
I was raped by a dirty <i>gringo</i>
in a truck from Texas.

355
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,841
You're sick.
What are you gonna do

356
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:08,343
when they get you
to the hospital

357
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,345
and the doc wants to shove
his hand up your ass

358
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,013
to give you an examination?

359
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,057
Not so good, huh, sonny?

360
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,268
Get your ass out of here.
Jesus! Hit the highway.

361
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:20,229
Then, I'll walk
like a cripple. Like this...

362
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:24,901
And I'll say your truck,
you hit me and run away.

363
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:26,861
Jesus Christ.

364
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:29,572
I'll tell them that this thing

365
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:31,783
is not yours.

366
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,326
It's stolen.

367
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:36,329
Jesus!
You're sick as a dog.

368
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:38,748
Get out of here. You ain't...

369
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:40,291
Jerk off.

370
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:53,429
All right, where's the wallet?

371
00:27:53,513 --> 00:27:54,555
Where's what?

372
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,224
My wallet. Give it here.

373
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,184
We go and I tell you, okay?

374
00:27:58,267 --> 00:28:00,228
Look, the only place
you're gonna go

375
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,771
is the hospital.

376
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:03,815
Now give me
the goddamn wallet.

377
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:05,692
Ah. You get too angry.

378
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:07,944
It's not good for you
at your age.

379
00:28:08,027 --> 00:28:09,821
Give me the wallet now!

380
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:11,072
Eat shit.

381
00:28:11,155 --> 00:28:12,657
What are you talking about,
"eat shit"?

382
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,576
Yeah.

383
00:28:16,786 --> 00:28:17,870
Yeah.

384
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:18,871
You're pretty quick
for old man.

385
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:20,081
"Eat shit." Yeah.

386
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:22,291
Okay,
I'll make a deal with you.

387
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,918
What deal?

388
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,754
I give your wallet,
you take me to the border.

389
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:30,383
{\an5}Only to the border.
Then I get across by myself.

390
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:35,138
No deal. No dice.

391
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:41,811
I want to go
with my father.

392
00:28:58,202 --> 00:29:00,997
All right. Get in the back.

393
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:11,632
I want you
to take this chicken,

394
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,593
tie his leg back down there
so it doesn't...

395
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:16,053
I don't want him crapping
on the upholstery here.

396
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,180
No.

397
00:29:17,263 --> 00:29:18,639
What do you mean, "no"?

398
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,350
No, and he's not a chicken.
His name is Macho.

399
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,103
I don't care if his name
is Colonel Sanders.

400
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:25,980
Just get his ass back there.

401
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,064
He's Macho.

402
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,316
You know what it means,
"macho"?

403
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,525
It means "strong."

404
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,486
Come on, Macho.

405
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:33,070
Yeah.

406
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:34,864
Shit.

407
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,504
It's bad to have a fighter,
a champion,

408
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:51,506
with his leg tied all day.

409
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,675
<i>Gringo,</i>

410
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,969
you look a smart man to me.

411
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:58,805
So...

412
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:01,474
I'll make a deal with you.

413
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:03,851
Yeah? What kind of a deal?

414
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:05,603
If Macho sits with us,

415
00:30:05,686 --> 00:30:06,771
when he fights,

416
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:09,357
I'll give you half
of the money.

417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,028
The day Macho sits up here
is the day I barbecue his ass.

418
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:18,199
It's not good for his spirit.

419
00:30:20,701 --> 00:30:23,412
Well, I'm really worried
about that.

420
00:30:24,247 --> 00:30:27,458
But he's strong now.

421
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:29,627
When I first find him,

422
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,046
he'd lose every fight.

423
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,173
He was on the ground.

424
00:30:34,257 --> 00:30:35,967
His leg broke.

425
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,638
So, I took care of him,
and I said,

426
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,600
"Stand up, you bastard.
Fight!"

427
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,979
He killed a very big rooster.

428
00:30:48,896 --> 00:30:50,439
From that time,

429
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:53,317
he's Macho.

430
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,027
A champion.

431
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,737
That's the most
exciting thing

432
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,281
I've ever heard.

433
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:07,373
Why don't we sleep
in the truck?

434
00:31:07,456 --> 00:31:08,791
Yeah.

435
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,919
'Cause we can sleep out here
in the wide-open spaces.

436
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,254
The air is nice and clean.

437
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:15,506
It's not like it is
in the cities.

438
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,008
It's beautiful.

439
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:19,594
I think something else maybe.

440
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:20,720
What?

441
00:31:21,304 --> 00:31:22,680
Like

442
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,683
when I fall asleep,
you'll drive away without me.

443
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,311
Yeah.

444
00:31:28,394 --> 00:31:31,022
I'm not gonna run away
without you, kid.

445
00:31:31,105 --> 00:31:33,065
Just go to sleep.

446
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,402
What's the matter
with this guy?

447
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,779
He's got something
on his eye here.

448
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,489
Got something in right here.

449
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:42,325
Wait, wait a second.

450
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:45,244
- Oh.
- Yeah. I got it.

451
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,370
Very good.

452
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:47,955
Go ahead.

453
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,917
You're a <i>veterinario?</i>

454
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,668
No. No, <i>veterinario.</i>

455
00:31:52,752 --> 00:31:55,796
I've just loved animals
all my life.

456
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,341
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

457
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,760
At rodeo?

458
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:02,261
Yeah, rodeo.

459
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:04,180
Working on ranches

460
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:08,142
and working with horses
and stuff especially.

461
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,728
Well, so I think
he'll be fine.

462
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:14,440
Macho. His name is Macho.

463
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:16,943
Whatever.

464
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:18,778
What's wrong with that?

465
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:19,987
Nothing.

466
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,865
Guy wants to name
his cock "Macho"...

467
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:25,368
It's okay by me.

468
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:29,538
He's macho, like me.

469
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,248
Very strong rooster.

470
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:32,708
Everyone wants him.

471
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,002
One even stole him from me.

472
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:39,048
Yeah, your mother says you've
stolen a few things yourself.

473
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,758
Cars and such.

474
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:44,011
When we get up in the States,
you touch a man's vehicle,

475
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,389
that doesn't go over.

476
00:32:46,472 --> 00:32:50,101
Yeah. I'll remember
when we get to Texas.

477
00:32:50,184 --> 00:32:51,769
Especially in Texas.

478
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:56,273
{\an5}And you can watch all that
"macho" crap up there too.

479
00:32:56,357 --> 00:32:58,484
Nobody likes that stuff.

480
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,707
How'd you get the bruises?

481
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:18,713
Being on the street
cause all that?

482
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,340
Sometimes.

483
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:27,722
{\an5}And sometimes when I go
home, it's worse.

484
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:30,975
That's why I stay
on the streets.

485
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,227
All the bad stuff
happens at home.

486
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:39,859
My mom hates me.

487
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,655
You want to know why?

488
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,365
Not really.

489
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:50,411
She bring home
a strange man today,

490
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:52,913
another strange man tomorrow,

491
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,541
and she said
I should call them "Uncle."

492
00:33:55,624 --> 00:33:58,085
And I say to her,

493
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,337
"How many men
can I call 'Uncle'?"

494
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:04,008
So, she hates me.

495
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:06,802
And Aurelio,

496
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,472
he was in prison.

497
00:34:09,555 --> 00:34:13,517
Sometimes he sells drugs
and brings her pills and dope.

498
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:18,272
One time I spit on him.

499
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,900
He hits me
to teach me manners

500
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,402
and I said to him...

501
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:27,615
"Don't teach me manners

502
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:31,160
{\an5}when you're in bed with my
mom, where she sleep."

503
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:34,455
So, I say, to hell with that.

504
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:37,500
I make a few pesos
with Macho for myself

505
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,378
and I do what I want.

506
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,548
On the street,

507
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,300
I trust no one.

508
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,678
But it's safer than at home.

509
00:34:57,686 --> 00:35:00,481
You can never trust no one.

510
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:38,102
We're gonna take

511
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:40,062
a little bit
of a different route here.

512
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,024
- <i>Federales</i> are there.
- Oh, shit.

513
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,943
We gotta go down this road.

514
00:35:46,026 --> 00:35:47,278
What do they want?

515
00:35:47,361 --> 00:35:49,155
Well, they probably
wanted you.

516
00:35:50,573 --> 00:35:51,991
We'll stay away from them.

517
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,534
What are we doing?

518
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:56,996
We go off,
take this road here.

519
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,081
All the way around,

520
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:00,291
and we won't have to deal
with them.

521
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:03,127
No good.
It's bump, bump, bump.

522
00:36:04,461 --> 00:36:07,256
Bit more like
jail, jail, jail.

523
00:36:20,436 --> 00:36:22,354
Hi.

524
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:25,900
{\an5}We brought our own red
rooster with us, see?

525
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,568
In your honor.

526
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:28,777
<i>Gracias.</i>

527
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:32,406
Uh, I'm gonna have
a <i>cerveza blanca</i>

528
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,782
and he'll have a...

529
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,373
What's Amarillo?

530
00:36:41,457 --> 00:36:44,960
Uh, nothing.
Just something I drink.

531
00:36:45,044 --> 00:36:46,921
Oh, okay.

532
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:50,507
<i>Gracias.</i>

533
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,678
It's tequila.

534
00:36:55,763 --> 00:36:57,890
- Tequila.
- Yeah.

535
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:00,142
You're not gonna drink
any tequila.

536
00:37:00,226 --> 00:37:01,769
But I want it.

537
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,646
{\an5}I don't care.
You're not gonna drink it, not with me.

538
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:07,149
I drink tequila
once and I never got sick.

539
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,485
{\an5}Yeah, well, when you're with your
dad, up above the border,

540
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:10,945
you can drink battery acid,

541
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,197
but you're not gonna
drink tequila with me.

542
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,407
An Orange Crush, <i>por favor.</i>

543
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,328
Yeah, that's better.

544
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:22,957
I'll be back.

545
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,124
Where are you going?

546
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,584
Make a little call.

547
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,599
Yeah, hello.

548
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:42,476
I found the boy.

549
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,644
Yes!

550
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:46,480
Shit, that's great!
That's great!

551
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:47,773
<i>It wasn't easy,</i>

552
00:37:47,856 --> 00:37:49,817
but I found him
and we're on our way.

553
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,069
Not without bumps,
but we're on our way.

554
00:37:52,152 --> 00:37:53,862
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

555
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:55,197
I knew you'd find him.

556
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,199
I knew I did the right thing
sending you.

557
00:37:57,283 --> 00:38:01,036
{\an5}Not like those other two
guys you sent down here.

558
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,330
<i>Thanks a lot for that.</i>

559
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:05,916
I'm gonna be calling you
along the way

560
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,794
{\an5}<i>and you'll be playing it straight with
me, understand?</i>

561
00:38:08,877 --> 00:38:11,297
Okay. All right.

562
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,341
Just get him
back up here, okay?

563
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,427
- <i>You've got it.</i>
- All right.

564
00:38:35,863 --> 00:38:37,656
Kinda glowing there, kid.

565
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:47,166
Ah. Fine Mexican beer.

566
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,002
Can I wear your hat?

567
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:53,630
No.

568
00:38:54,548 --> 00:38:55,716
Why not?

569
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:57,885
Because it's a cowboy hat.

570
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,763
And you're not a cowboy.

571
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:03,724
Anything a <i>gringo</i> cowboy
can do with horses,

572
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,726
a <i>Mexicano</i> can do better.

573
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,230
Well, you're
in bad shape, then,

574
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,066
because you're half <i>gringo.</i>

575
00:39:17,363 --> 00:39:20,074
What do you think, kid?

576
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,827
You think I'm a <i>gringo?</i>

577
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:25,746
Yeah.

578
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:31,043
Do you think
I'm like my father?

579
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,462
A coward?

580
00:39:34,296 --> 00:39:35,756
Who run away?

581
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,469
- Well...
- You think

582
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,554
I'm like my mom?

583
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:44,014
Weak?

584
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:48,644
I don't know.
I don't know your mom.

585
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,270
- But your father...
- Then...

586
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,109
who am I, Mike?

587
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:00,280
Here, kid. Try the hat...

588
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,408
I don't want to wear
your dumb, stupid hat.

589
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:14,086
Mike!

590
00:40:25,013 --> 00:40:27,349
Help me, Mike!
Get off!

591
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:28,934
What the hell
are you doing?

592
00:40:29,017 --> 00:40:30,477
{\an5}- You leave him alone.
- Get away.

593
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,312
He's not your son.
He's not yours to take.

594
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,815
His mother warned you, <i>gringo.</i>
Don't be stubborn!

595
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:36,608
- No.
- This is your last chance.

596
00:40:36,692 --> 00:40:39,403
- Mike!
- The kid is not your concern.

597
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:41,780
- Good job, Macho.
- Hey, stupid bird!

598
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:44,116
Good job, Macho.

599
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,873
Okay.

600
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:52,624
Hey!

601
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:00,674
What's he saying?

602
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:02,926
{\an8}It's not good.

603
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,941
Rafael. Rafael.

604
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,533
Time for us to go.

605
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,845
You did all right, kid.
You did all right.

606
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:55,229
You want
another tortilla?

607
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,314
No, I don't.
I don't think so. No.

608
00:41:58,774 --> 00:42:00,734
What's the matter?

609
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,904
Yeah, no,
I don't feel too good.

610
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:10,244
I don't know
why you're laughing.

611
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:13,288
You Mexicans
always laugh at us <i>gringos</i>

612
00:42:13,372 --> 00:42:15,999
because we get sick
on your dirty water.

613
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:19,294
It's not the water
that's dirty. It's you.

614
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:21,171
We drink and we're healthy.

615
00:42:21,255 --> 00:42:24,258
You drink it
and die in the toilet.

616
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,843
Ah, don't mention that.

617
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:28,845
Speaking...

618
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:36,019
Run! It's gonna come out.

619
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:41,400
Wait. I'll give you something
to make you feel better.

620
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:43,485
What?

621
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,789
Here, try it.

622
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:56,790
Cactus?

623
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:58,083
Yeah, it's good. Try it.

624
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:00,002
You try it.

625
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:03,380
Okay. Watch.

626
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,676
- See? I did not die.
- Okay.

627
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,979
Hey!

628
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:20,522
- Go! Go, go, go!
- No!

629
00:43:21,857 --> 00:43:23,358
The car!

630
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:24,526
No!

631
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:28,530
No!

632
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:34,286
Stop!

633
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:39,958
Shit!

634
00:43:47,299 --> 00:43:50,052
I can't even call the cops.

635
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,365
So, what now?

636
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,117
We gotta get ourselves
some transportation.

637
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:15,452
And clothes.

638
00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,996
And you should dress
not like an American.

639
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,792
So everybody doesn't see
<i>gringo, gringo, gringo.</i>

640
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,545
I want some water.

641
00:44:31,093 --> 00:44:34,262
{\an5}There's a store right here.
I think I'll go check it out.

642
00:44:35,597 --> 00:44:36,598
Yeah.

643
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,326
Look, Macho.

644
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,453
A <i>gringo</i> goes in,
and a <i>Mexicano</i> comes out.

645
00:44:58,537 --> 00:45:00,330
Yeah, I bought you
some clothes.

646
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:01,665
Thank you.

647
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:02,749
Well,

648
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,043
I guess we should be going.

649
00:45:05,127 --> 00:45:06,128
What's this?

650
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:07,629
Transportation.

651
00:45:09,381 --> 00:45:11,925
Transportation?
Where'd you get it?

652
00:45:12,008 --> 00:45:13,009
I find it.

653
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:15,971
Bullshit.

654
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:18,765
{\an5}It was sitting right here.
So nobody want it, I guess.

655
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,269
Yeah? Nobody was
sitting in it then, huh?

656
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,854
We'll leave it
in the next town.

657
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:26,106
- Yeah.
- I only lend it from somebody.

658
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:28,233
In Mexico,
we're friendly people.

659
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:29,901
You lend, I lend.

660
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:32,112
{\an5}- We lend, everybody lends.
- Yeah, yeah.

661
00:45:32,195 --> 00:45:33,155
What?

662
00:45:33,238 --> 00:45:34,656
Just, uh...

663
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,742
It's not your car

664
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:38,493
and I'll be driving it.

665
00:45:48,587 --> 00:45:49,629
Macho.

666
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:19,034
You're kind of
growing on me, kid.

667
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:25,040
This looks like
an interesting town.

668
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,752
Maybe we should check it out.

669
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:37,969
<i>Hola,</i> Mama.

670
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,025
What do you say
we look around, huh?

671
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,614
Bring in the rooster.

672
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,045
<i>Federales.</i>

673
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,907
I'll have coffee for me,

674
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,326
and anything in the house
for him.

675
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:05,974
<i>Aqui.</i>

676
00:48:07,642 --> 00:48:09,060
Thank you.

677
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:41,551
Uh...

678
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:43,094
She says that's strange.

679
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:45,347
The <i>Federales</i>
never come over here.

680
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:47,849
<i>Gracias.</i>

681
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:50,977
Thank you very much. Yeah.

682
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:52,228
<i>Si.</i> Uh...

683
00:49:06,993 --> 00:49:09,663
I'm gonna take
a little <i>siesta</i> here.

684
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,832
Tired, eh?
Old man needs a nap?

685
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,876
You bet.

686
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:34,312
Macho.

687
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,190
The hell you doing here?

688
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,946
Don't drink out of my cup
either, will you, pal?

689
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:52,998
{\an5}Dreamt I was in a desert
bar, but now I'm in one.

690
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:56,543
Jerk.

691
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:19,107
She says you don't snore.
She likes that.

692
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,609
Oh. Well...

693
00:50:22,444 --> 00:50:24,237
did I miss anything here?

694
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,574
{\an5}Yeah. She asked why the
<i>Federales</i> were looking for us.

695
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,494
{\an5}I tell her you're my father,
and you broke out of the <i>loco,</i>

696
00:50:31,578 --> 00:50:33,204
the crazy hospital.

697
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:35,915
And they're looking for you.

698
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,084
And she bought into all that?

699
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:41,254
She didn't believe me.

700
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,757
So, then I told her

701
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,342
you're here to bring me
to Texas with my father

702
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:48,428
and my mother says no.

703
00:50:48,511 --> 00:50:50,638
So, you told her the truth.

704
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,142
I thought
you didn't trust anyone.

705
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,770
No.

706
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,605
But you trust her?

707
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,570
{\an5}Yeah. Yeah, for some
reason, I guess, yes.

708
00:51:07,155 --> 00:51:09,449
Oh, well,

709
00:51:09,532 --> 00:51:11,409
on that, I think we oughta...

710
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:14,287
We oughta go.

711
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,539
Will you, uh,
thank the <i>senora</i> for me?

712
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:19,292
<i>Senorita.</i>

713
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,337
She's not married.
She's a widow.

714
00:51:23,088 --> 00:51:25,048
Marta.

715
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,716
<i>Mi nombre,</i> name,

716
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:28,510
Marta.

717
00:51:31,346 --> 00:51:32,555
I'm Mike.

718
00:51:33,473 --> 00:51:35,725
<i>Si.</i> He say.

719
00:51:36,851 --> 00:51:37,852
Yeah.

720
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:40,688
Okay.

721
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,313
Not another roadblock.

722
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:40,415
What's the Spanish word
for "irony"?

723
00:52:42,417 --> 00:52:45,587
Well, we'll have to go back
to that town we were in.

724
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,133
Just wait till
this shitstorm's over with.

725
00:52:56,472 --> 00:52:58,933
Perfect place
to get out of the rain.

726
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:23,833
Huh.

727
00:53:25,084 --> 00:53:26,586
It's a shrine, Mike.

728
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:34,093
Of the <i>Virgen Maria.</i>

729
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,111
Okay.

730
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,364
What are you doing?

731
00:53:54,447 --> 00:53:56,616
- Hmm?
- What are you doing?

732
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:57,784
Oh, I'm, uh...

733
00:53:59,994 --> 00:54:01,788
I'm gonna go to sleep.

734
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,790
What the hell
do you think this is?

735
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:07,835
We cannot sleep in the shrine
of the <i>Virgen Maria.</i>

736
00:54:07,919 --> 00:54:11,965
Maria's not gonna worry
about it. She's fine.

737
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,635
She won't care.

738
00:54:26,771 --> 00:54:28,064
Night, kid.

739
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:34,362
Mike?

740
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:35,446
Yeah?

741
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,365
Mike, do you believe in God?

742
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:43,288
I don't know, kid.

743
00:54:44,539 --> 00:54:46,249
I guess so, yeah.

744
00:54:48,334 --> 00:54:51,546
You Catholic?

745
00:54:52,297 --> 00:54:53,631
No.

746
00:54:53,715 --> 00:54:55,717
I'm not Catholic, kid.

747
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,094
That's too bad for you, Mike.

748
00:54:58,177 --> 00:55:00,513
Even if you believe in God
and you're not Catholic,

749
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:04,142
they don't believe in you.

750
00:55:04,225 --> 00:55:07,770
What, is he playing favorites,
maybe, or something?

751
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:09,522
Yeah.

752
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:11,691
I don't believe this shit.

753
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:14,819
"We're all God's children."

754
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,487
Do you?

755
00:55:19,032 --> 00:55:22,452
Well, we're all
somebody's children, kid.

756
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,336
Do you have any children?

757
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:33,963
No.

758
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,343
Oh, I did.

759
00:55:39,344 --> 00:55:40,345
Did?

760
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:42,847
Yeah.

761
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,557
Matthew, boy.

762
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:49,437
My boy...

763
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,148
and my wife were killed
in an auto accident

764
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:53,816
some years back.

765
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:56,611
Sorry.

766
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:01,240
Anyway...

767
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:06,412
I wasn't much good after that.

768
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,748
I kind of went
on a rampage.

769
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:10,583
Too much drinking.

770
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:12,919
Being crazy.

771
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:18,257
But your dad,

772
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,803
he saved my ass.

773
00:56:23,846 --> 00:56:25,556
He gave me work.

774
00:56:27,975 --> 00:56:29,060
He...

775
00:56:30,478 --> 00:56:32,939
gave me my life back.

776
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,774
I owe him a lot.

777
00:56:37,276 --> 00:56:39,946
And you're the payback, kid.

778
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,615
You're the payback.

779
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,910
I'm paying him back.

780
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:06,556
Hey!

781
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:19,902
Look at this. Fantastic, huh?

782
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,033
How'd you know
we were here?

783
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:35,168
She came to light a candle,
and she saw our car.

784
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,295
Yeah.

785
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:39,338
Well, thanks.

786
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:40,715
<i>Gracias.</i>

787
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,843
<i>Muy bien.</i>

788
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,660
Oh, damn!

789
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:21,214
What's the matter?

790
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:22,757
Look, the car.

791
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:31,641
Whoa, Jesus.

792
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,810
Well,

793
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:37,188
we better get used
to this town, kid.

794
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:39,106
We're gonna be here
a while.

795
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,984
It's a piece of shit.

796
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:03,422
Everything all right?

797
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:04,507
Hey.

798
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:07,426
You speak English, <i>amigo?</i>

799
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,053
Yeah.

800
00:59:09,136 --> 00:59:13,099
These horse are for sale.
You want to buy?

801
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:17,103
I noticed one of those guys
has got an injury

802
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,188
on the left haunch there.

803
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:20,898
He's a little rough to me.

804
00:59:20,982 --> 00:59:22,358
Yeah, in fact,
all your horses

805
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:24,527
are a little
on the rough side.

806
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:27,071
They get hurt
being rounded up.

807
00:59:27,154 --> 00:59:28,781
Wild horses, huh?

808
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:31,784
<i>Si,</i> we catch,
but not break them.

809
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:33,619
They are very wild.

810
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,371
Not many can ride.

811
00:59:35,454 --> 00:59:36,789
Yeah.

812
00:59:36,872 --> 00:59:39,875
Pretty hard to sell a horse
that you can't ride.

813
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,469
{\an5}Maybe we can
do something about that.

814
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,513
- We? Who's we?
- Yeah.

815
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:53,764
You and me.

816
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,435
I don't even know how to ride.

817
00:59:57,518 --> 00:59:58,728
But I can do anything.

818
00:59:58,811 --> 01:00:00,062
Of course you can.

819
01:00:00,146 --> 01:00:02,106
Wouldn't want to
get up there in Texas

820
01:00:02,189 --> 01:00:05,234
and have people find out
you don't know how to ride.

821
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:35,514
Whoa.

822
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,643
Macho.

823
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:41,354
Okay.

824
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,314
Pick up the flow, will ya?

825
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,026
{\an5}Keep your weight on
the balls of your feet.

826
01:00:50,655 --> 01:00:53,407
More like it.
Do less with your hands.

827
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:57,161
Pick it up more.

828
01:00:58,704 --> 01:00:59,830
Attaboy.

829
01:01:01,374 --> 01:01:02,917
Not bad at all.

830
01:01:04,669 --> 01:01:07,213
Pick it up. Pick it up. More.

831
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,589
There you go.

832
01:01:08,673 --> 01:01:11,217
Don't lay back.
Stay upright.

833
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,636
There, that's good.
That's good.

834
01:01:13,719 --> 01:01:15,721
Heels down. That's good.

835
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:17,056
That's a good
little figure eight.

836
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:18,474
Come back this way.

837
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:25,731
All right, son.
You're doing good.

838
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,733
You're doing great.

839
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,903
May not be a disgrace
in Texas after all.

840
01:01:56,387 --> 01:01:58,472
Here's a gift, ladies.

841
01:02:01,475 --> 01:02:02,727
<i>Cafe?</i>

842
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,147
Sure. All right.

843
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,693
Okay.

844
01:02:24,498 --> 01:02:26,500
Thank you.

845
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:31,672
{\an5}You know, we just brought
you that meat as a gift.

846
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:38,304
Yeah, I just came here
to bring stuff.

847
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:42,433
I didn't come here
to freeload a meal.

848
01:02:42,516 --> 01:02:43,642
Uh...

849
01:02:53,444 --> 01:02:57,406
Um, she says
she'll do as she pleases.

850
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:59,074
Oh, all right.

851
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:01,452
Okay.

852
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,383
These your girls?

853
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,149
Mm-mm.

854
01:03:32,233 --> 01:03:33,651
Granddaughters.

855
01:03:33,734 --> 01:03:37,071
Her daughter got sick
and died.

856
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:38,739
Also her son-in-law.

857
01:03:40,115 --> 01:03:42,535
Her husband died too.

858
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:44,870
Same illness. Two years ago.

859
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:46,997
Now widow, like you.

860
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:49,625
Sorry.

861
01:03:51,919 --> 01:03:53,462
No.

862
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,530
She's deaf?

863
01:04:20,614 --> 01:04:21,782
Seems so.

864
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:25,452
How do you know sign language?

865
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,790
Just something you pick up
along the way.

866
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:46,098
What did you say?

867
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:48,225
Wouldn't you like to know?

868
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:55,357
<i>Gracias.</i>

869
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:09,723
So, what's that all about?

870
01:06:10,641 --> 01:06:12,101
The deputy.

871
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:13,602
What about the deputy?

872
01:06:13,686 --> 01:06:16,730
Uh, first,
he said he's a sheriff

873
01:06:16,814 --> 01:06:19,566
and it's his job to know
what's going on.

874
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:22,569
{\an5}But she said he's not the sheriff.
He's a deputy.

875
01:06:22,653 --> 01:06:25,239
{\an5}And that's only because
his uncle made him deputy.

876
01:06:25,322 --> 01:06:27,658
And they don't even have
a police station.

877
01:06:27,741 --> 01:06:29,368
And if he didn't mind
his business,

878
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:31,412
she said he never eat
at the <i>cantina</i> again.

879
01:06:33,288 --> 01:06:35,916
Um, he said...

880
01:06:39,294 --> 01:06:41,171
Uh, what's next?

881
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:55,894
Looking good, kid.

882
01:06:58,564 --> 01:07:01,567
Look where you're going,
and go where you're looking.

883
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:04,820
Good.

884
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:06,488
Put your heels down.

885
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:07,698
Okay.

886
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:09,283
Heels down.

887
01:07:09,366 --> 01:07:11,577
Yeah, don't look like
a sack of potatoes there.

888
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,583
{\an5}Your dad's gonna be a happy
man seeing you that way.

889
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,876
- We'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah.

890
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:21,795
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

891
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,635
Uh, this is <i>Senora</i> Reyes.

892
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,262
Her goat
was attacked by dogs,

893
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:32,931
so I tell her
you're good with animals.

894
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,808
Well, why don't you put him
over here.

895
01:07:34,892 --> 01:07:37,561
Put him on this table,
we'll take a look.

896
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,027
Put him right up there.

897
01:07:45,903 --> 01:07:47,613
Let me see.

898
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,865
Let's see. Oh, yeah.

899
01:07:49,948 --> 01:07:52,743
{\an5}Yeah, somebody chewed
on him pretty good.

900
01:07:52,826 --> 01:07:54,620
Not so good. Yeah.

901
01:07:56,747 --> 01:07:57,790
Yeah.

902
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,636
Okay, I think
we can fix her up in a bit.

903
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:11,929
And it's gonna be okay.

904
01:08:13,138 --> 01:08:14,473
All righty.

905
01:08:14,556 --> 01:08:15,808
<i>Mike,
it should've taken three,</i>

906
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:17,267
<i>maybe four days tops.</i>

907
01:08:17,351 --> 01:08:19,478
<i>But two goddamn weeks?
What are you doing?</i>

908
01:08:19,561 --> 01:08:21,980
{\an5}I told you it was
gonna take a little while.

909
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:23,649
I heard that already.

910
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,068
Just keep telling him
what he wants to hear.

911
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:27,611
- Who?
- <i>"Who?"</i>

912
01:08:27,694 --> 01:08:30,364
The kid. Rafael.

913
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,491
Just keep him happy,

914
01:08:32,574 --> 01:08:33,826
and whatever you do,

915
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,494
do not let his mother
get a hold of him.

916
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:37,913
<i>Or her lawyers
will never respond.</i>

917
01:08:37,996 --> 01:08:39,331
Respond to what?

918
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:41,083
<i>It's a business thing.</i>

919
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,668
A few years ago,
down there in Mexico,

920
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,920
I invested in some property
in her name

921
01:08:45,003 --> 01:08:47,172
to avoid their goddamn taxes,

922
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,925
and now those investments
have matured.

923
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:52,177
So I want the return
on my investment.

924
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,679
Just like the kid.

925
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,722
{\an5}<i>Well, yeah, okay.
So, you get it.</i>

926
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:56,932
Mm-hmm.

927
01:08:57,015 --> 01:08:59,184
I get it.
You played me, you bastard.

928
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,519
I didn't play you.

929
01:09:00,602 --> 01:09:02,855
What are you,
eight years old, Mike?

930
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,481
Jesus!

931
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:06,900
If I have something
she wants,

932
01:09:06,984 --> 01:09:09,069
<i>maybe she'll negotiate.</i>

933
01:09:09,153 --> 01:09:11,488
Christ, I'm a reasonable man.

934
01:09:11,572 --> 01:09:13,866
I'm just asking for my half.

935
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:16,702
This kid would be better off
without either one of you.

936
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,120
Well, you know what?

937
01:09:18,203 --> 01:09:19,538
It doesn't make a shit
what you think, Mike.

938
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,373
I'm his father

939
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,251
and I actually
want him back.

940
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:28,088
<i>This isn't all about
the money, okay?</i>

941
01:09:28,172 --> 01:09:29,756
The kid's my son.

942
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,176
So, please...

943
01:09:33,385 --> 01:09:36,054
Please, can you stick
to the plan?

944
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,015
Just meet me at the border
with him.

945
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:40,726
Yeah.

946
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,201
Was that my father?

947
01:09:57,284 --> 01:09:58,577
Yeah, it was, kid.

948
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,287
Did he say anything
about me?

949
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,914
Ask how I am?

950
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:05,292
Well, he did, yeah. He...
He wants the best for ya.

951
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,586
- He does?
- Yeah.

952
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:10,130
He still wants me?
He still wants me to come?

953
01:10:10,214 --> 01:10:12,549
'Course he does, kid.
Why wouldn't he?

954
01:10:17,638 --> 01:10:19,932
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Give me that.

955
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:23,435
Okay, come on, there.

956
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:24,811
Right through there.

957
01:10:24,895 --> 01:10:27,648
Stick your head in there,
and put it on up here.

958
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,026
Put this here. Okay.

959
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,320
We got him.

960
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:35,989
Now, that was the easy part.

961
01:10:36,073 --> 01:10:38,325
- That was the easy part?
- Yeah.

962
01:10:38,408 --> 01:10:41,453
Next, they don't like it
when you cinch the girth.

963
01:10:42,454 --> 01:10:43,872
It's just like this.

964
01:10:43,956 --> 01:10:45,916
You just have to pull,
cinch it up.

965
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:47,125
You can do it.

966
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,794
- You wanna try it?
- Okay.

967
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,964
{\an5}Just cinch it up, and put up half of...
An eighth of it.

968
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,968
Whoa! Whoa.

969
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:58,971
Whoa.

970
01:10:59,054 --> 01:11:00,722
Whoa! He's so wild.

971
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:03,350
Okay, yeah.
Take it easy.

972
01:11:03,433 --> 01:11:05,185
Hey, hey. Hey.

973
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:15,153
How did you do that?

974
01:11:15,946 --> 01:11:17,864
We did it, partner.

975
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:19,157
We did it.

976
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:40,595
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

977
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:41,596
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

978
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:42,848
Sleep well?

979
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:45,017
I did, yeah. I did.

980
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,101
Thank you.

981
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:59,698
{\an5}Uh, Marta says we can stay in
the <i>casita</i> behind her house

982
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:01,241
while we are here.

983
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:03,201
No.

984
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:05,037
We can't do that.
Can't do that.

985
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,497
We've already
imposed on her enough.

986
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:08,582
Well...

987
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,725
Uh...

988
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:27,893
She said it's her choice.

989
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,311
- And she already...
- Right.

990
01:12:29,394 --> 01:12:30,604
...cleaned it out for us.

991
01:12:30,687 --> 01:12:32,314
Plus, she says
we can't keep sleeping

992
01:12:32,397 --> 01:12:34,232
in the shrine
of the <i>Virgen Maria.</i>

993
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:36,735
It's not a hotel.

994
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:40,197
I know.
I'm fighting a losing battle.

995
01:12:41,948 --> 01:12:43,241
Okay.

996
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,910
It's good or it's no?

997
01:12:45,786 --> 01:12:47,120
It's no.

998
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,248
But what do we do
when we leave?

999
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,710
We get ourselves another car,
that's what we do.

1000
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:33,500
Cook?

1001
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,252
Yeah. Well, you're always
cooking all the time.

1002
01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:36,878
I thought
I would do it for you.

1003
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:39,506
And cowboys always cook.

1004
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:41,299
It's kind of our deal.

1005
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:47,180
Okay.

1006
01:13:48,598 --> 01:13:49,641
You want?

1007
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:51,143
Um...

1008
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,227
Yeah.

1009
01:14:09,327 --> 01:14:10,328
Amen.

1010
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:16,710
Okay.

1011
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:21,673
Um...

1012
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:24,092
I think she likes you.

1013
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:28,930
Just keep
your big mouth shut.

1014
01:14:29,014 --> 01:14:32,392
And I think you like her.

1015
01:14:50,202 --> 01:14:52,078
- <i>Gracias.</i>
- <i>Gracias.</i>

1016
01:14:58,168 --> 01:14:59,878
More money to come.

1017
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:01,463
More mustangs to break.

1018
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:03,215
Yeah, you bet.

1019
01:15:04,508 --> 01:15:06,551
The whole neighborhood's
coming down here.

1020
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,929
{\an5}They must think I'm
Dr. Dolittle or something.

1021
01:15:09,012 --> 01:15:10,597
- Uh...
- The hell is this?

1022
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,016
{\an5}These girls need
some help with the animals.

1023
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,897
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

1024
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,399
{\an5}I don't know what to
tell you about this gal.

1025
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:22,901
Yeah, what do you say?

1026
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:25,153
You just need to lose
a little weight, that's all.

1027
01:15:29,699 --> 01:15:34,579
You take it easy,
just a little more water.

1028
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,624
Little more water
and less food.

1029
01:15:48,718 --> 01:15:50,762
He wants
to know who are you,

1030
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:51,930
what's your business?

1031
01:15:54,683 --> 01:15:58,395
Do you have a, uh, <i>licencia?</i>

1032
01:15:58,478 --> 01:15:59,980
Well, these people want me

1033
01:16:00,063 --> 01:16:02,607
to take care
of some of their animals.

1034
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:05,318
People seem to think
I have a knack with that.

1035
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:16,538
He said, help the dog,

1036
01:16:16,621 --> 01:16:18,039
or his wife
will be very angry.

1037
01:16:18,123 --> 01:16:19,249
Yeah?

1038
01:16:19,332 --> 01:16:20,292
He said it's not good
when she's angry.

1039
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,459
She'll be angry?

1040
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,461
- Not for you either.
- Hmm.

1041
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,965
Okay. All right.

1042
01:16:27,048 --> 01:16:28,049
Yeah.

1043
01:16:29,259 --> 01:16:30,802
Looks pretty good.

1044
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:38,184
I don't know
how to cure "old."

1045
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:41,688
{\an5}I don't know.
But no way am I telling her that.

1046
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:43,940
Hmm. Well...

1047
01:16:44,024 --> 01:16:46,443
I think the dog
just needs a lot of rest.

1048
01:16:46,526 --> 01:16:49,571
Maybe he should sleep
with you tonight.

1049
01:16:49,654 --> 01:16:51,489
On the end of the bed.

1050
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:52,866
How's that?

1051
01:16:52,949 --> 01:16:54,326
<i>Gracias.</i>

1052
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:55,452
Yeah.

1053
01:16:56,369 --> 01:16:58,163
We'll do the best we can.

1054
01:16:58,246 --> 01:16:59,331
<i>Gracias.</i>

1055
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:34,366
I got you.

1056
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,367
Okay.

1057
01:17:40,538 --> 01:17:42,332
Just give it a smash.

1058
01:17:45,210 --> 01:17:46,211
Okay.

1059
01:17:47,545 --> 01:17:48,880
I'm catching on to this stuff.

1060
01:17:48,963 --> 01:17:50,048
<i>Si.</i>

1061
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,444
This right here. Thanks.

1062
01:18:11,528 --> 01:18:12,529
Yep.

1063
01:18:15,156 --> 01:18:16,700
Oh.

1064
01:18:16,783 --> 01:18:18,368
There, I think we got it.

1065
01:18:19,411 --> 01:18:20,537
Think we got it.

1066
01:18:32,006 --> 01:18:33,383
Italian lager.

1067
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,401
{\an5}If my father
didn't want me to come to Texas,

1068
01:20:15,485 --> 01:20:17,111
I would stay here.

1069
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:20,490
Yeah.

1070
01:20:20,573 --> 01:20:23,243
You could've stayed too.
It's good.

1071
01:20:24,494 --> 01:20:26,371
Mm-hmm.

1072
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:29,499
The best place I've stayed
in my life.

1073
01:20:32,335 --> 01:20:35,296
Maybe even better than Texas.

1074
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:38,466
Hmm.

1075
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:41,386
Could be, kid.

1076
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:47,600
But I want to be
with my father.

1077
01:20:47,684 --> 01:20:50,186
Have a new life in America.

1078
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:55,567
But what if it's no good?

1079
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:58,611
{\an5}What if my father change
his mind when he meets me?

1080
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:01,781
Doesn't want me?

1081
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:05,326
He wants you, kid.

1082
01:21:08,705 --> 01:21:09,956
He wants you.

1083
01:21:45,241 --> 01:21:46,993
Rafo!
The hell you doing?

1084
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:48,036
Nothing.

1085
01:21:48,119 --> 01:21:49,787
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

1086
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:51,289
What?

1087
01:21:51,372 --> 01:21:53,875
Aurelio. I saw him in town,
he's talking to the cops.

1088
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:56,085
We gotta get on the road.

1089
01:21:56,169 --> 01:21:57,295
Uh...

1090
01:21:57,378 --> 01:22:00,924
But what about the girls?
What about Marta?

1091
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:02,675
Us being around here
is the worst thing

1092
01:22:02,759 --> 01:22:04,052
that could happen
to the girls.

1093
01:22:04,135 --> 01:22:06,554
We gotta get moving.
Come on.

1094
01:22:06,638 --> 01:22:08,139
Get your ass in gear.

1095
01:22:22,195 --> 01:22:23,905
<i>Hola,</i> Mike.

1096
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:26,157
Marta, we...
We have to go.

1097
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,992
We've got a job
we've gotta finish,

1098
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,827
and just...

1099
01:22:32,246 --> 01:22:35,083
{\an5}Well,
you've been so great to us, you know,

1100
01:22:35,166 --> 01:22:36,918
it's just tough to leave.

1101
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:41,297
{\an5}That,
and the kids and everything,

1102
01:22:41,381 --> 01:22:42,423
it's just...

1103
01:22:45,218 --> 01:22:46,678
Anyway...

1104
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:48,930
we've gotta go.

1105
01:22:58,189 --> 01:22:59,857
Thanks for everything.

1106
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:27,635
Let's try this thing.

1107
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:41,774
Okay. You go here.

1108
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,822
Okay, go ahead.

1109
01:23:58,249 --> 01:24:01,461
{\an5}What do I say when they ask
for my papers at the border?

1110
01:24:01,544 --> 01:24:03,713
What do I tell them?

1111
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,089
You don't have
to tell 'em anything.

1112
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:07,008
Your dad will be there.

1113
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:08,843
He'll take care of it all.

1114
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:11,012
Okay.

1115
01:24:39,332 --> 01:24:42,543
Yeah.
We gotta lose these guys.

1116
01:24:48,424 --> 01:24:50,385
When I get
to the next set of curves,

1117
01:24:50,468 --> 01:24:53,054
just hang on,
we'll get rid of 'em.

1118
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:23,876
We lost them.

1119
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,879
Yeah, for the time being,
anyway.

1120
01:25:26,963 --> 01:25:28,339
Look, kid,

1121
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:30,007
{\an5}there's something I didn't
tell you the other day

1122
01:25:30,091 --> 01:25:31,384
when we talked.

1123
01:25:31,467 --> 01:25:33,219
It's about your dad.

1124
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:35,763
Yeah, I mean,

1125
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:37,557
{\an5}he wants you to come be
with him and everything,

1126
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:38,891
but there's another reason.

1127
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:40,434
And that's 'cause
your mother and he

1128
01:25:40,518 --> 01:25:42,270
have some investments
together.

1129
01:25:42,353 --> 01:25:45,439
{\an5}And he thinks if you're
with him up in Texas,

1130
01:25:45,523 --> 01:25:49,110
that she'll give him half
of all the investments.

1131
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:51,362
So, you lied?

1132
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:53,364
No, I didn't lie.

1133
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:56,200
I just didn't know
at the time, that's all.

1134
01:25:56,284 --> 01:25:58,035
Bullshit.

1135
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:02,665
Hundreds of horses,
cattle, a ranch...

1136
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:04,709
It's a rodeo.

1137
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:07,044
Yeah, that's all true, kid.

1138
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,297
That's all true.
He has all that.

1139
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,009
You're gonna love it there.

1140
01:26:13,092 --> 01:26:15,011
How could he...

1141
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,388
How could you?

1142
01:26:17,471 --> 01:26:18,389
No...

1143
01:26:18,472 --> 01:26:20,600
I should have never trust you.

1144
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:23,060
Never trust anyone.

1145
01:26:23,144 --> 01:26:25,479
I didn't know at the time,
that's all.

1146
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:28,566
You're a liar.

1147
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:31,402
And I hate you.
I hate you.

1148
01:26:31,485 --> 01:26:33,029
And I hope you die in jail.

1149
01:26:33,112 --> 01:26:35,823
Jesus Christ, kid.

1150
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,693
Bunch of rubes.

1151
01:27:19,075 --> 01:27:21,452
What the hell
is he looking for, anyway?

1152
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,037
Drugs.

1153
01:27:26,457 --> 01:27:27,625
Drugs?

1154
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:29,710
You gotta be out
of your minds.

1155
01:27:33,965 --> 01:27:36,676
Jerk offs. Asshole.

1156
01:27:36,759 --> 01:27:38,552
We don't have any drugs.

1157
01:27:39,553 --> 01:27:41,138
Jesus Christ.

1158
01:27:54,277 --> 01:27:56,404
Mickey Mouse prick.

1159
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:00,741
Yeah.
Nothing.

1160
01:28:00,825 --> 01:28:02,952
- Yeah.
- When did you leave Veracruz?

1161
01:28:03,035 --> 01:28:05,788
I've never been
to Veracruz ever.

1162
01:28:08,874 --> 01:28:10,668
He said,
"Where are the drugs?"

1163
01:28:10,751 --> 01:28:13,004
But no, we don't have drugs.

1164
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:14,880
We don't have any drugs.

1165
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:17,133
You guys
are wasting your time.

1166
01:28:17,216 --> 01:28:19,176
You got nothing else to do.

1167
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:20,595
Loser cops.

1168
01:28:20,678 --> 01:28:23,848
{\an5}You wanna help us put this
stuff back in the car?

1169
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:27,018
<i>Caballeros,</i>
I guess we make a mistake.

1170
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:28,102
Yeah.

1171
01:28:28,644 --> 01:28:29,603
Good.

1172
01:28:29,687 --> 01:28:32,189
<i>Vamonos.</i> You're free to go.

1173
01:28:32,273 --> 01:28:33,983
Couldn't be sooner.

1174
01:28:34,066 --> 01:28:35,526
Jesus Christ.

1175
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:38,529
One thing
I don't understand.

1176
01:28:38,612 --> 01:28:39,780
Those bastards.

1177
01:28:39,864 --> 01:28:41,949
If you have no drugs,
why you run?

1178
01:28:42,033 --> 01:28:43,743
We're not running, asshole.

1179
01:28:56,672 --> 01:28:57,673
Uh...

1180
01:29:04,388 --> 01:29:07,433
Yeah,
his dad's <i>enfermo</i> in Texas,

1181
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:08,893
and we gotta get up there
right away.

1182
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:24,533
<i>Gracias.</i>

1183
01:29:24,617 --> 01:29:25,659
Gentlemen.

1184
01:29:27,453 --> 01:29:30,331
Jesus Christ.
Asshole.

1185
01:29:34,043 --> 01:29:35,086
Losers.

1186
01:29:35,795 --> 01:29:37,046
Stupid bastards.

1187
01:29:37,129 --> 01:29:39,340
If they had a brain,
they'd be dangerous.

1188
01:29:39,423 --> 01:29:41,425
Thanks a lot, you pricks.

1189
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,677
Okay, let's get this stuff
in the car.

1190
01:29:43,761 --> 01:29:46,389
You and I, we gotta talk.

1191
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,767
I don't want to talk to you.

1192
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,352
{\an5}Yeah, well, you're gonna talk to
me whether you like it or not.

1193
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:53,145
I thought
you were my friend.

1194
01:29:53,229 --> 01:29:56,065
For the first time,
I thought I had a friend.

1195
01:29:57,983 --> 01:29:59,276
You're nothing to me.

1196
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,570
You just get shit
in the car,

1197
01:30:01,654 --> 01:30:02,905
and shut up.

1198
01:30:07,284 --> 01:30:08,577
I'm gonna get the seat

1199
01:30:08,661 --> 01:30:09,912
if you can help me
with it a little bit.

1200
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:17,128
Hey, quick. Pull this.

1201
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:19,463
Your father lied
to both of us.

1202
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:23,884
And... So, quit bitching, huh?

1203
01:30:23,968 --> 01:30:26,053
You're both goddamn liars.

1204
01:30:35,938 --> 01:30:36,981
Okay.

1205
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:42,570
Okay.

1206
01:30:45,739 --> 01:30:48,325
Freedom's just on the other
side of this hill, kid.

1207
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:51,579
Let's go.

1208
01:30:54,373 --> 01:30:55,416
Let's go.

1209
01:31:12,975 --> 01:31:14,685
You used to be tough.

1210
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,980
Now you're weak.

1211
01:31:19,398 --> 01:31:23,402
You used to ride bulls,
ride horses.

1212
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:25,821
You were something.

1213
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:28,365
I was something.

1214
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:31,327
You used to be strong.

1215
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,329
Macho.

1216
01:31:36,165 --> 01:31:37,625
Now you're nothing.

1217
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:39,460
Yeah.

1218
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:44,298
Well, I used to be
a lot of things,

1219
01:31:44,381 --> 01:31:46,342
but I'm not now.

1220
01:31:46,425 --> 01:31:48,928
And I'll tell you something.

1221
01:31:49,011 --> 01:31:51,680
This macho thing
is overrated.

1222
01:31:51,764 --> 01:31:53,766
Works perfect for him,

1223
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:56,852
but it's overrated.

1224
01:31:56,936 --> 01:32:00,105
Just people
trying to be macho

1225
01:32:00,189 --> 01:32:02,775
to show that
they've got grit.

1226
01:32:02,858 --> 01:32:05,694
That's about
all they end up with.

1227
01:32:05,778 --> 01:32:08,489
{\an5}And you sit there and let
a bull step all over you,

1228
01:32:08,572 --> 01:32:11,909
and you let a horse throw you
50 feet in the air.

1229
01:32:12,743 --> 01:32:14,078
What an idiot.

1230
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:17,289
Only an idiot would be
in a profession like that.

1231
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:19,708
It's just...

1232
01:32:20,793 --> 01:32:22,211
It's like anything else
in life.

1233
01:32:22,294 --> 01:32:24,421
You think
you got all the answers,

1234
01:32:24,505 --> 01:32:25,839
then you realize
as you get old,

1235
01:32:25,923 --> 01:32:27,800
that you don't have
any of 'em.

1236
01:32:29,843 --> 01:32:33,138
{\an5}By the time you figure it
out, it's too late.

1237
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,023
Your dad's a good man.

1238
01:32:43,107 --> 01:32:45,818
We all have to make choices
in life, kid.

1239
01:32:46,819 --> 01:32:49,113
You have to make yours.

1240
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:50,823
Where do you want to go?

1241
01:32:54,326 --> 01:32:56,203
I made my choice, Mike.

1242
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,331
I wanna go.

1243
01:33:13,304 --> 01:33:14,346
Oh, shit.

1244
01:33:16,265 --> 01:33:18,517
Let's get you out of here.

1245
01:33:19,727 --> 01:33:20,853
Hey, Mike.

1246
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:23,480
Remember me?

1247
01:33:24,732 --> 01:33:25,941
Rafo,

1248
01:33:26,025 --> 01:33:27,151
I don't want
to hurt your grandpa,

1249
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:29,612
so come with me, okay?

1250
01:33:30,404 --> 01:33:31,405
Mike.

1251
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:44,251
Mike.

1252
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,172
Stay there, asshole.

1253
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:50,174
Okay.

1254
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:20,454
So, what do you think
about Macho now?

1255
01:34:20,537 --> 01:34:22,122
I think a lot about him.

1256
01:34:22,206 --> 01:34:26,251
I think he handled everything
just beautifully back there.

1257
01:34:26,335 --> 01:34:27,628
Yeah, he's amazing.

1258
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:29,213
The real deal.

1259
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:30,297
Yeah.

1260
01:35:03,956 --> 01:35:04,998
Huh.

1261
01:35:07,584 --> 01:35:09,294
Thank you, Mike.

1262
01:35:11,004 --> 01:35:13,424
You're welcome, kid.

1263
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,884
You take care
of that chicken, huh?

1264
01:35:18,011 --> 01:35:19,555
He's not a chicken.

1265
01:35:20,597 --> 01:35:21,974
He's Macho.

1266
01:35:28,188 --> 01:35:29,231
He's yours now.

1267
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:31,191
You're sure?

1268
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:34,111
It could be...

1269
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,949
Saturday night barbecue,
you never know.

1270
01:35:44,204 --> 01:35:45,289
I'll take care of him.

1271
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:49,209
And you take care, kid.

1272
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:53,797
You take care.
You know where we are.

1273
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:55,466
If you need us.

1274
01:35:56,633 --> 01:35:57,926
Thank you.

1275
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:02,806
All right, boy.

1276
01:36:13,484 --> 01:36:15,319
Yeah.

1277
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,613
I hear you, loud and clear.

1278
01:36:27,956 --> 01:36:28,957
Huh.

1279
01:36:36,256 --> 01:36:37,508
All right, kid.
