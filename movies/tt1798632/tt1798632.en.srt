1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Who are the real-world Illuminati ?
Find out @ saveanilluminati.com

2
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,783
Where'd you find that?

3
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,619
Promise you'd quit.

4
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,497
Yeah. Yeah, it's not so easy,
you know.

5
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,334
Wait, why are you awake,
Charlie?

6
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,627
Bad dream.

7
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,507
Me, too.

8
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,968
Do you want to talk about it?

9
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,346
Put that down, please.

10
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,974
Come on, that's not a toy.

11
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,809
Come on.

12
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,988
What's going on, sweetie?

13
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,451
Daddy?

14
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,536
Hmm?

15
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,580
Something feels weird.

16
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,624
In my body.

17
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,752
I think we should go talk
to your mom about this.

18
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,919
Uh, you know.

19
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,963
Not that thing.

20
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,966
- The other thing.
- The other thing.

21
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,429
The bad thing.

22
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,723
Something's changing.

23
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,646
You remember your tools?

24
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,024
If you ever get nervous,
if you're ever scared...

25
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,738
...you start to lose control,
what do you do?

26
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,785
Flowers.

27
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,874
Clock.

28
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,588
See, uh, forest.

29
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,964
Bunny.

30
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,093
And sweet Charlie.

31
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,845
The bad thing...

32
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,014
it's been gone a long time.

33
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,517
You're strong, Charlie.

34
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,602
So you don't have to be afraid.

35
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,689
All right.

36
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,524
Hey. Is everything okay in here?

37
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,734
Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,944
Peachy.

39
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,874
I'm really hungry.

40
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,668
Who wants pancakes?

41
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,920
Pancakes?

42
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,547
You want pancakes?

43
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,049
- I want pancakes.
- No, you don't like pancakes.

44
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,679
Blueberries, what else?
Chocolate?

45
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,930
- Mm-hmm.
- Chocolate?

46
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,557
- Yeah.
- What else do you want?

47
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,766
Um...

48
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,728
- Strawberries.
- Coffee.

49
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,706
- Coffee? Black coffee?
- Orange juice.

50
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,115
Thank you so much

51
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,700
- for coming in today.
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,077
How are you enjoying college
so far?

53
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,247
Uh... I'm having fun.

54
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,042
It's busy. Kind of more work
than I thought.

55
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,251
I'm kind of homesick.

56
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,753
I'm just gonna ask you

57
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,087
a few questions here.

58
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,214
- It's kind of background stuff.
- Okay.

59
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,133
Ever used hallucinogenic drugs?

60
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,760
Too scared.

61
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,636
Uh...

62
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,598
I mean, it's college, man.
You know?

63
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,558
How about
your father's blood type?

64
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,477
Do you know
your parents' blood types?

65
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,604
You know what?
I don't. Fair enough.

66
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,065
Where do your parents live?

67
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,859
They don't.
They died when I was ten.

68
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,628
Says here you were
raised in a group home.

69
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,112
Is that correct?

70
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,115
Indeed, I was, uh,
from the time that I was seven.

71
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,658
Numbers are in the threshold,

72
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,802
but let's keep an eye on it.

73
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,036
Telekinetic spikes.

74
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,245
Confirming here, too.

75
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,622
Why do you need to know

76
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,956
so much about my parents?

77
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,708
Genetic history.

78
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,128
It helps us understand
and evaluate the test results.

79
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,714
Slightly erratic,
but, uh, it's okay.

80
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,275
We need to drop
his levels to five...

81
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,594
The ad said that this was
just an FDA clinical trial.

82
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,278
Half of the people
will be getting

83
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,853
injections of water, and
the other half will get water

84
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,899
mixed with a chemical compound
that we call "Lot Six."

85
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,651
A chemical compound?

86
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,653
Like what? What is it?

87
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,199
But half of us are just
gonna get the placebo, right?

88
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,576
Either way,
it's entirely harmless.

89
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,203
Well, how do you know?

90
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,205
I mean, that's why
you're testing it, right?

91
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,589
My next question here
is a little weird.

92
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,258
Can you tell me
if you've ever had

93
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,553
what you would call
an authentic psychic experience?

94
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,682
I'd rather not talk about that.

95
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,183
Okay, let's make sure

96
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,893
we're recording
her numbers here.

97
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,065
Confirmed telekinetic activity.

98
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,192
I don't like
these questions, man.

99
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,656
Just part of the evaluation.

100
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,700
Let me ask you again.

101
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,620
Have you ever experienced
any inexplicable phenomena

102
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,832
that goes against natural law?

103
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,251
I saw my parents die
in a car wreck.

104
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,588
I'm sorry to hear that.

105
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,090
But what about that
makes it inexplicable?

106
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,593
I saw it a week before
it actually happened.

107
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,154
The readings are erratic!

108
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,387
Turn it off.

109
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,306
We need to unhook him now!

110
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,034
Turn that camera off!

111
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,079
- Get him out of here.
- I still see it.

112
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:26,066
Hold him down!

113
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,859
Turn it off. Turn it off!

114
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,329
My service guarantees
that after just three sessions,

115
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,998
your nicotine cravings
will disappear.

116
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,958
And all we do is talk?

117
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,878
Sounds crazy, right?

118
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,005
It's not.

119
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,676
- It's magic.
- Okay.

120
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,903
Uh, uh, I don't know, Mr. McGee.

121
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,428
Well, call me Andy.

122
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,807
Andy, uh, a hundred dollars
per session...

123
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,768
Yeah, that's a lot
for my budget.

124
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,144
Let's just try it.

125
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,437
One session.

126
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:05,897
If you don't
walk out of here today

127
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,440
feeling better than
you've ever felt,

128
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,293
with these nicotine cravings
already starting to fade,

129
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,902
it's on the house.

130
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,904
Now, close your eyes.

131
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,702
Keep 'em closed.

132
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,120
Good.

133
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,956
Now, imagine the Darla
that you want to be.

134
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,875
Picture her.

135
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,210
Smoke-free.

136
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,173
A beacon of respiratory health.

137
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,805
Now look at me in the eyes.

138
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,144
Don't look away.

139
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,895
No matter what.

140
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,151
You feel better about
yourself already, Darla.

141
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,712
Healthier.

142
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,154
More positive. Healthier.

143
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,989
You hate the taste of tobacco.
More positive.

144
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,992
And that stale cigarette smell
makes you want to puke.

145
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,831
You are done with smoking.

146
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,300
You know,

147
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,843
I...

148
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,887
I feel better already.

149
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,348
What?

150
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,099
Wow.

151
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,810
Healthier, more positive.

152
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,357
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,359
Okay, um...

154
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,737
Okay, I have 75, but I can...

155
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,447
I can give you
a credit card if you...

156
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,407
No, it's-it's cash only,
so that's fine.

157
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,451
-I'll just take
what you have now. -Oh.

158
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,220
-Yeah? -Yeah. I'm sure
you're good for the rest.

159
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,830
Oh. I am indeed.

160
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:46,831
Thank you.

161
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,501
Wild.

162
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,339
Take care.

163
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,541
Ew!

164
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,126
Nice work, goober.

165
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,261
How is it going
over here, Gavin?

166
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,049
- Weird girl killed our frog.
- It was already dead.

167
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,093
Yeah, but now it's extra dead.

168
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,178
That's okay, Charlie.

169
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,097
A quick Google search

170
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,492
will show you all the frog guts
you want dissected perfectly.

171
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,977
We don't even need
to do this anymore.

172
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,311
I don't have Google.

173
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,192
Quiet, class.

174
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,112
I forgot. Sorry.

175
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,947
You ever go
to the public library?

176
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,074
You can use the computers there.

177
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,577
Too much screen time can cause
health problems in children,

178
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,619
like insomnia.

179
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,375
I think a little screen time
would be just fine.

180
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,626
Help with your grades, too.

181
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,211
Okay.

182
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,380
Now that we dissected our frogs,

183
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,382
let's go back to the diagram

184
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,967
and compare it with what we saw.

185
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,570
- Now, notice the liver...
- Hey.

186
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,931
Is it true that Amish families
share the same bathwater?

187
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,225
'Cause that's weird.

188
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,269
And you're weird.

189
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:38,985
Notebook.

190
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,070
Pencil.

191
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,321
Desk.

192
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,447
Shoes.

193
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,491
Paper.

194
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,160
Eraser.

195
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:48,220
Calculator.

196
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,412
Everything okay, Charlie?

197
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,125
Yes, Ms. Gardner.

198
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,645
Charlie.

199
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,563
Is everything okay in here?

200
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,405
I don't want to go to school.

201
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,079
We just want you
to have a normal life.

202
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:33,289
I want stupid Wi-Fi.

203
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,375
That's normal.

204
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,089
That stuff rots your brains.

205
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,552
Do you really believe that?

206
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,095
Mm-hmm.

207
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,474
Plus, it's expensive, you know?

208
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,103
Monthly bills, smart phones.

209
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,440
We just, you know...
we can't afford it right now.

210
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,067
Sorry.

211
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,404
It happened again.

212
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,076
The bad thing.

213
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,163
This boy made fun of me.

214
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,959
He called me weird.

215
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,462
You're not weird.

216
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,130
I'm worse.

217
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,716
No. No.

218
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,968
You're special.

219
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,974
I knew it
the day that you were born.

220
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,604
You were warm and toasty
like a buttery muffin.

221
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,778
Hmm?

222
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,530
Are you scared of me?

223
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,620
I could never
be scared of you.

224
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,623
Come here.

225
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,302
Three years.

226
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,137
We got...
we got too comfortable.

227
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,264
I just don't get it.
Like, why now?

228
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,141
What's the trigger?

229
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,768
She's not in puberty.

230
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,395
Is she?

231
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,646
No.

232
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,231
Oh, God.

233
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,238
It really scared her
when it happened.

234
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,590
Maybe she needs
to be scared, Vick.

235
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,533
- She needs to be trained.
- Oh, my God.

236
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,618
Our responsibility
is getting her ready.

237
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,578
Making her strong
in case they come.

238
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,039
Our responsibility
is to protect her.

239
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,457
Training her is protecting her.

240
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,685
Says the one who hates
her power so much,

241
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,169
- she won't even use it.
- Wha...

242
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,171
It's different for us.
We know what it's like...

243
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,132
Be normal?

244
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,259
But when you're born
this way...

245
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,636
She's not a robot.
She's a little girl.

246
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,346
With little girl feelings
and emotions,

247
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,265
which are wildly unpredictable.

248
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,808
It's too dangerous.

249
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,227
She just has to shove it down
and keep it hidden.

250
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:00,812
She did it before.

251
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,857
She can do it again.

252
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,763
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

253
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:37,223
Loser.

254
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,352
Let's go.

255
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,480
You okay, Charlie?

256
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,650
Weirdo.

257
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,115
Yeah, run away, you freak.

258
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,285
Charlie?

259
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,680
Charlie?

260
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,577
Charlie?

261
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,920
What the...

262
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,890
Please. Charlie?

263
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,935
Whatever's going on...

264
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,313
Charlie?

265
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,400
Please leave.

266
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,198
Charlie?

267
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,864
Holy sh-shit.

268
00:20:09,584 --> 00:20:13,338
I was in the east end,
uh, of the school...

269
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,714
It won't happen again.

270
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,800
How can you be so sure?

271
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:21,513
Does Charlie have a history
of destructive behavior?

272
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,264
No, of course not.

273
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,058
She's been less than forthcoming

274
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,643
about how she did it.

275
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:30,522
What she used
to cause the explosion.

276
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,898
Please don't call it
an explosion.

277
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,441
It makes her sound like
a terrorist.

278
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,735
The bathroom stall
exploded, ma'am.

279
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,696
What would you like us
to call it?

280
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:41,866
Regardless, the police want to
investigate the matter further.

281
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,414
That blast was like
a siren call.

282
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,766
I know you don't want
to hear this,

283
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,291
but none of this
would have happened

284
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,602
if she knew how to use it.

285
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,586
Jesus.

286
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,422
Look at my eyes.

287
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,924
Every time I try to do it,
it-it chips away at me now.

288
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,927
I can't do the push without
my eyes literally bleeding now.

289
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,679
Why didn't you tell me?

290
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,764
Come on.

291
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,659
But that doesn't mean
it will happen to Charlie.

292
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,163
That's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

293
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,439
I don't have your power.

294
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,690
Okay?

295
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,400
I can't push her
if she loses control.

296
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,485
Well, I would never push
my own kid.

297
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,614
Our cover is blown, okay?

298
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,492
If they catch her,
they're gonna lock her away.

299
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,637
They're gonna run tests on her
for the rest of her life.

300
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,913
They're gonna take her,
they're gonna put her in a cage.

301
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,623
We'll never see her again, Vick.

302
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,917
Who knows what's gonna
happen to her?

303
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,754
If who catches me?

304
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,101
You're supposed to be
in your room, Charlie.

305
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,552
You were yelling.

306
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,015
Charlie, I need you to go
to your room right now, okay?

307
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,059
And pack a bag.
We're leaving in the morning.

308
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,687
Sweetie, do you think...
Are we bad people, Charlie?

309
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,398
Mm-mm.

310
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Do you know why
we have to move all the time?

311
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,486
Hmm?

312
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,154
Because of your work.

313
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,491
But also because
bad men are after us.

314
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,034
Really bad.

315
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:08,036
Because of the special things
that we can do,

316
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,038
the pushing and the fire.

317
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,707
And if they catch us,
they're gonna put us in jail.

318
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,502
It's why we can't have
cell phones or Wi-Fi.

319
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,545
Because they can track it.

320
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,547
I'm sorry we lied to you.

321
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,676
But I ran to the bathroom
so I wouldn't hurt anyone.

322
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,511
That was the right thing
to do, Charlie.

323
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,096
That was, that was right.

324
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,932
I tried to throw it in
the water, but it didn't work.

325
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,868
And now we're in trouble
and we're going to jail,

326
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,185
and it's all my fault.

327
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,788
Okay, you got to stay calm.

328
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:34,955
- Calm down, Charlie.
- Just stay calm, sweetie.

329
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,439
- You're okay.
- I'm not okay.

330
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,858
Stop saying that.
And I'm not special!

331
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,610
I'm a monster!

332
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,171
- You are not a monster.
- You just need to calm down.

333
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,923
- I'm a monster. I'm a monster.
- You're not. -Calm down.

334
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,092
- You're not a monster.
- I'm a monster. I'm a monster!

335
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:47,701
Charlie.

336
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,577
I hate living like this!

337
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,496
Tough luck, Charlie!
This is who you are!

338
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,832
Please, Andy. Stop.

339
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,418
You made me this way.

340
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,877
Charlie, please!

341
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,046
I hate who I am, and I hate you!

342
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,881
Charlie!

343
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:05,552
Charlie!

344
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,807
You're all right. Oh, God.

345
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,184
I'm really sorry, sweetie.

346
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,979
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

347
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,564
- I'm so sorry.
- Charlie.

348
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,232
Charlie, no. Charlie, no.

349
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,859
Charlie.

350
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,068
Charlie, no. I'll be okay.

351
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:26,656
She's okay.

352
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,009
911. What is your emergency?

353
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,577
See? She's fine.

354
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,079
- Come on. Please.
- Hello?

355
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,582
Hello?

356
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,851
Are you there...

357
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,710
Okay.

358
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,004
It's okay. It's all right.

359
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,843
It's okay. It's all right.

360
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,874
Is this Rainbird?

361
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,543
Yes.

362
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,962
This is
Captain Jane Hollister, DSI.

363
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,840
I'm reactivating you, Rainbird.

364
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,344
If that would be of interest.

365
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,280
Course it's still the cleaning
up other people's shit,

366
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,557
just not literally.

367
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,061
I left that life.

368
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,939
Yeah, and how's that
working out for ya?

369
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,691
I know what happened.

370
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,069
Shop used you up and threw you
out like unwanted trash.

371
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,822
And that wasn't right.

372
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,743
But that was the old guard.
I'm the new.

373
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,750
Something's happened, Rainbird,

374
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,835
and I need it handled
with discretion.

375
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,588
I understand
that was your specialty.

376
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:54,804
What is the target?

377
00:25:57,849 --> 00:26:02,604
Something for which
you are uniquely qualified.

378
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,900
But unlike the others,

379
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,944
I need this quarry back alive.

380
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,281
Is that something
you can handle?

381
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,967
Good job. Good job.

382
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,825
There we go.

383
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,227
- You okay?
- Ow.

384
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:45,438
Ow. Ow. Oh.

385
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,901
Vick, this is bad.

386
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,155
Oh, fuck.

387
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,116
Almost done.

388
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,788
That's it.

389
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,374
You could've pushed her.

390
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,251
We have no idea
what's happening when

391
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,712
I'm going into those people's
minds, moving things around.

392
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,356
Why would you ever want me
to do that to Charlie?

393
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,882
- What if I mess her up?
- And if she kills one of us?

394
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,926
Don't fucking go there.

395
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,469
Andy.

396
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:19,806
This is what happens
when you stuff it down.

397
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:21,182
It doesn't go away.

398
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,186
Can you take her to the movies
or something, please?

399
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,022
Ice cream or something?

400
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,155
- Just get some rest, okay?
- Okay.

401
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:25,056
Vicky McGee?

402
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,516
I'm just following up

403
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,227
on an emergency call
from earlier tonight.

404
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:30,395
Oh, yeah.

405
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,480
It was a grease fire.

406
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,815
On the stove.

407
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,275
My daughter overreacted.

408
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:37,444
If you or your daughter
need help...

409
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,362
It's nothing like that.

410
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,157
Honestly.

411
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:48,121
You're sure about that,
you have a good night, then.

412
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,306
Oh, Charlie.

413
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:09,392
Ow.

414
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,198
Where did they go?

415
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:27,243
Your husband and the girl.

416
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:36,169
Ice cream. Movies.

417
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,050
Ice cream...

418
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,927
or the movies?

419
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,016
Did you think you were unique?

420
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,645
Before they tested their poison
on pretty, young coeds,

421
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,231
they had to use lab rats.

422
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,573
And you're out of practice.

423
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,657
How could you work for them?

424
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:50,035
Help them
after what they did to you?

425
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,662
Come peacefully,
and you'll live.

426
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,457
I will die
before I let them have her.

427
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:58,585
Your life, to them,
is a secondary concern.

428
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,503
And yours?

429
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:28,281
When you see her,
you'll understand.

430
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:30,492
And you will regret.

431
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:44,130
Do you think she'll forgive me?

432
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,177
Well, she's your mom.

433
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,429
She'll always forgive you.

434
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,348
No matter what.

435
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:59,020
It was supposed to be you.

436
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,355
What?

437
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,654
It was supposed to be you.

438
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,383
I feel weird.

439
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:31,094
Mm, too much rocky road.

440
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,387
She's probably asleep.

441
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:33,531
I'm gonna go check on her, okay?

442
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:35,432
Here, take that to the trash.

443
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,517
And then throw on your pj's,
all right?

444
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:58,747
Surrender.

445
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,540
- Charlie?
- Daddy?

446
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:02,542
No one gets hurt.

447
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,131
Let her go.

448
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,468
You know what it costs,
don't you?

449
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,137
To hurt someone.

450
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,805
To take a life.

451
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:19,100
Would you ask that
of your own child?

452
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:23,730
Do you feel that?

453
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:26,358
Let her go,
or it's gonna get a lot worse.

454
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,484
Where's Mommy?

455
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,902
She has no aim without sight

456
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:30,570
if she's like the rest of us.

457
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,280
Where's my wife?

458
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,536
Where's Mommy?

459
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:43,333
I don't know, sweetheart.

460
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,834
Yes, you do.

461
00:34:44,876 --> 00:34:47,128
Where's Mommy?! Tell me now!

462
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,466
Mom?

463
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:04,437
Run.

464
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,522
Run, Charlie!

465
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,693
- Run!
- Mommy!

466
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:28,712
Come on. We have to get
somewhere safe.

467
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:52,193
Dr. Wanless, you have a guest.

468
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:56,698
Good morning, Joseph.

469
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,783
I brought you something.

470
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:02,537
Your favorite colors, too.

471
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:12,589
I'm Captain Hollister,
newly appointed DSI.

472
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,550
Why are you here?

473
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:17,635
Hmm, Captain?

474
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,847
I made calls
to your predecessor.

475
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,599
They went unanswered.

476
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,850
Hmm.

477
00:36:23,892 --> 00:36:27,854
But now they stuff a new face

478
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:30,815
into the same old suit,

479
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:33,735
and that face just comes

480
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:36,237
knocking on my door!

481
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:37,864
With all due respect, Doctor,

482
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:41,284
Captain McConnell doesn't have
the legs for this outfit.

483
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,411
Completely oblivious

484
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:47,540
to the dire nature
of the situation we've created!

485
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:48,667
We found them.

486
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,502
Joseph.

487
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,506
Shall we talk?

488
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:05,892
When you see her,
you'll understand.

489
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,977
And you will regret.

490
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,700
I miss you, Mommy.

491
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:22,909
I'll get 'em.

492
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,869
Oh, hi. Hi, kitty-kitty.

493
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,080
Hi.

494
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:52,791
Come here, kitty-kitty.

495
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:55,126
Come here. It's okay.

496
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:56,753
Don't run away. Come on.

497
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,422
It's okay. I'm nice.

498
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,507
I won't hurt you.

499
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,972
Charlie?

500
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,394
Charlie?

501
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,733
He scratched me.

502
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,906
Honey, he's in pain.

503
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,219
You have to put him
out of his misery, all right?

504
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,788
I really didn't mean to.

505
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,915
I know you didn't. I know.

506
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:36,918
This is what it costs, though.

507
00:39:39,754 --> 00:39:42,090
'Cause it can't be
a reaction like that.

508
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:44,718
It's got to be a...

509
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:46,594
A decision.

510
00:39:46,636 --> 00:39:48,156
That's the only way
you can control it.

511
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,849
You can do it.

512
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,121
Good job.

513
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,170
I want to help her.

514
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,047
You want to use her.

515
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,965
The girl...
She can't help what she is.

516
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:28,136
She... the poor thing, she's
been brain-fucked from birth.

517
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:34,100
This is a chance to turn a past
failure into present success.

518
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:38,146
I want you to come back
to work, Dr. Wanless.

519
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,694
How hard must it have been
for them?

520
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:47,655
The parents,
when the girl was born.

521
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:50,241
The bottle is late,

522
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:52,243
the baby cries,

523
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:57,582
and a teddy bear
bursts into flames.

524
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,835
Right there.

525
00:41:00,877 --> 00:41:03,963
In the crib beside her.

526
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:07,175
Can you imagine their fear?

527
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,928
And it's awful. That's really...

528
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,221
What's your point?

529
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:16,267
The girl's power
is in its infancy.

530
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:23,692
Terrible, yes, but trivial
compared to what's coming.

531
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:29,531
But she's growing,
our little girl.

532
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:33,660
She's becoming a young woman.

533
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:38,540
And someday soon,
the power will grow, too.

534
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,542
Perhaps it already has.

535
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:45,213
And then, one day,

536
00:41:45,255 --> 00:41:47,716
she may be capable...

537
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:53,930
...of creating
a nuclear explosion

538
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:57,684
simply with the force
of her mind.

539
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,353
Doctor, we built a facility

540
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:03,023
especially for people
like Charlie.

541
00:42:03,064 --> 00:42:06,693
We can teach her.
We can train her.

542
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,653
You can exploit her.

543
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,864
Don't you lecture me
on morality.

544
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,699
You developed Lot Six.

545
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:14,117
You gave it to those kids.

546
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,869
And it was a mistake!

547
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,954
Well, that's too fucking bad!

548
00:42:17,996 --> 00:42:19,831
It's done!

549
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,291
Jesus fuck...

550
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:23,084
We're not gonna clone her.

551
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,170
We're not gonna make
a little army of Charlies.

552
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:26,921
We just, we...

553
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,925
We want to understand her.

554
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:36,097
She's the first of her kind.

555
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:39,976
And no one understands her
better than you,

556
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,270
the man who made the serum.

557
00:42:42,312 --> 00:42:46,149
You're the father of it all.

558
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,234
What do you say?

559
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:59,329
There are none so blind
as those who will not see.

560
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,166
What?

561
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:09,297
Heed my words...

562
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:11,049
very carefully.

563
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:14,928
Terminate the girl,

564
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:18,932
or one day
she will destroy us all.

565
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:20,684
Do you hear me?

566
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,187
Terminate her.

567
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:29,651
I hoped
this would've gone better.

568
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:36,074
That's good.

569
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:38,159
Can we pray?

570
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:42,914
Yeah. Sure, we can pray.

571
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,666
All right.

572
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,797
Dear God,

573
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,092
please let this... cat

574
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,303
be happy in cat heaven.

575
00:43:57,345 --> 00:44:02,851
And, um, just, you know,
make sure that-that he, uh...

576
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:04,436
or she...

577
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,105
...or they,

578
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:10,984
it's like a big cat party
in cat heaven.

579
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,861
And bless Mommy, too.

580
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:19,701
Bless Mommy, too.

581
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:26,332
You know what Mom
wanted you to learn

582
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:28,376
more than anything in the world?

583
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,215
She wanted you to learn
to use your power.

584
00:44:35,216 --> 00:44:37,093
Because it's incredible.

585
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:39,304
And I bet if you have
her powers, you...

586
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,807
...probably have mine, too.

587
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,063
- The push?
- Yep.

588
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:54,194
It's serious stuff, Charlie.

589
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:56,738
That's why Mom wanted
to teach you,

590
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,741
to help you understand
how to use it.

591
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,246
If you do it too much,
it'll really hurt you.

592
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:07,916
But I don't feel the heat
when it happens.

593
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:12,295
It hurts you
on the inside, I mean.

594
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:16,841
Actually...

595
00:45:16,883 --> 00:45:18,426
it feels kind of good.

596
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:29,229
Why can't we drive our own car?

597
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,314
Because they're looking for us.

598
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,360
They won't really
put us in jail.

599
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:37,112
Not you.

600
00:45:38,613 --> 00:45:40,156
They'll study you.

601
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,326
Like the frog.

602
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:45,870
Yeah.

603
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,331
Yeah, like the frog.

604
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,584
Here's one.

605
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:53,545
Oh, come on, please. Yes!

606
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:57,298
Okay.

607
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,260
Do you really think
this is safe?

608
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,054
Right now, I think
we have to get off this road.

609
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,931
So...

610
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,808
Come on. We'll be smart.

611
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:10,395
Be clever. Let's go.

612
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,023
Oh, man.

613
00:46:13,064 --> 00:46:14,542
I didn't think anyone
was gonna stop.

614
00:46:14,566 --> 00:46:17,235
There's a lot of weirdos
around these parts.

615
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,486
You one of 'em?

616
00:46:18,528 --> 00:46:20,447
No, no, no, we're very normal.

617
00:46:20,488 --> 00:46:22,490
Y... Uh, tell the nice man
your name, sweetheart.

618
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:25,368
I'm Roberta,
but they call me Bobbi.

619
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,078
Yeah,
we're headed up to Boston.

620
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,164
My car broke down a ways back.

621
00:46:29,205 --> 00:46:30,999
Boston's a hell of a walk
from here.

622
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,001
Yeah, I know.
We really got to get there.

623
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,461
Is there any chance
you can take us?

624
00:46:34,502 --> 00:46:36,296
To Boston?

625
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,381
I'll cover your gas.

626
00:46:38,423 --> 00:46:39,924
I got things to do.

627
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:42,344
I got to check up on my wife.

628
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:43,553
What about a hundred bucks?

629
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:55,357
One hundred bucks.

630
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:03,490
Well, I'm not above a Benjamin.

631
00:47:03,531 --> 00:47:06,242
Climb in.

632
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:09,162
Hey, it's lunchtime.

633
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,538
The wife and I usually put out

634
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,415
a little sandwich spread
about now.

635
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:15,001
Why don't you come to the house
and-and fuel up for a bit?

636
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:17,337
I don't know. We...

637
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,880
My wife's waiting.

638
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,219
But Bobbi needs to eat.

639
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,637
Yeah.

640
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,181
Coming up.

641
00:48:05,593 --> 00:48:07,971
Come on in.

642
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:11,057
Let's get some food
in your bellies.

643
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,435
Would it be okay
if I played with your chickens?

644
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:16,563
Just watch out for the turds.

645
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,065
Yeah, sure.

646
00:48:19,107 --> 00:48:21,443
- Stay close, all right?
- Yep.

647
00:48:21,484 --> 00:48:23,403
Try not to cook any of them.

648
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:44,049
Essi! We're home.

649
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,968
Got some guests
for supper, Essi.

650
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,971
Little Bobbi and her dad... I
don't think I caught your name.

651
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:51,473
Frank.

652
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:54,267
Bobbi and Frank.

653
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,230
Cold beer?

654
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:00,732
Yeah, sure. Why not?

655
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,068
Thank you.

656
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,030
So, what do you do, Frank?

657
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,032
To keep the lights on.

658
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:10,408
I'm a life coach.

659
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,618
No shit.

660
00:49:11,659 --> 00:49:14,204
- Like Tony Robbins on TV?
- No.

661
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:16,414
No, not really like that,
but... -

662
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:20,251
I saw that documentary
on Netflix.

663
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:22,212
Old Tony cusses like
a son of a bitch,

664
00:49:22,253 --> 00:49:25,048
but folks seem to like him.

665
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,633
People will give you
their life savings

666
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,052
just to tell them
they're special.

667
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,345
- Life coach?
- Yeah.

668
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,347
Man.

669
00:49:32,389 --> 00:49:35,100
The whole world goin' to hell.

670
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,283
Hello?

671
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,371
Is anyone in there?

672
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:47,505
What's your name?

673
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:50,633
Essi.

674
00:50:51,593 --> 00:50:53,178
Hi, Essi.

675
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:57,182
I'm Charlie.

676
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,267
I'm here with my dad.

677
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:04,773
Hey!

678
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:08,109
How did you...?

679
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,570
Don't go disturbing Essi!
She needs quiet!

680
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:11,738
Hey, we're really sorry.

681
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,532
You've been more than kind.

682
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:15,617
Come on.

683
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,411
We should probably get going.

684
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,246
Where you headed?

685
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:22,582
And how you getting there?

686
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:25,460
I don't know.

687
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:30,674
Hey, look, I...

688
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:33,385
I overreact sometimes.

689
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:36,346
Especially with the missus.

690
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,431
I apologize.

691
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:41,643
Oh, how rude of me.

692
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:43,687
Come on.

693
00:51:49,859 --> 00:51:52,737
Essi, this is Frank.

694
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:55,490
And I guess
you already met Roberta.

695
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,202
She was making a left turn
out on Route 14,

696
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:01,705
and some a-hole ran a light.

697
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:03,373
She never saw it coming.

698
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:05,208
I'm so sorry.

699
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,586
We lost our boy that day, too.

700
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,799
But Essi's still alive,

701
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,844
and for that,
I'm more than grateful.

702
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:21,766
You can stay here till you go.

703
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:23,893
We'd enjoy the company.

704
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:32,819
Will they find us?

705
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,530
You let me worry about that.

706
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:38,700
The most important thing
we can do is just keep running.

707
00:52:38,742 --> 00:52:40,952
If they do, I can hurt them.

708
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:49,586
I'll only hurt bad people,
I promise.

709
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,381
The day you were born.

710
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:55,467
Do you remember that story?

711
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:58,970
Mommy said
I was a buttery muffin.

712
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,764
Oh, my gosh, you were.

713
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:03,808
You were just
a little buttery muffin.

714
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:07,979
There's more to that story.

715
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:11,649
It was so cute
how warm you were,

716
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,903
but pretty soon, your
body temperature just went...

717
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:17,947
Shot off the charts.

718
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:19,908
And the doctors,
they were all...

719
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:21,242
they were all confused.

720
00:53:21,284 --> 00:53:23,244
They were, uh...

721
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:24,805
They didn't know
what could cause this,

722
00:53:24,829 --> 00:53:27,832
so we stayed up with you
all night.

723
00:53:27,874 --> 00:53:29,542
All day.

724
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:31,670
I could barely keep
my eyes open.

725
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,713
I was falling asleep everywhere.

726
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,930
And that's when they took you.

727
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,558
I used to get
these premonitions,

728
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,686
this really weird,
weird feeling.

729
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:50,397
Like how I did at the house.

730
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:51,523
Mm-hmm.

731
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:55,694
I could sense where you were.

732
00:53:55,735 --> 00:53:57,404
I could see you.

733
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:59,531
And I found you.

734
00:53:59,572 --> 00:54:00,949
What did you do?

735
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:20,051
I was so angry
at what they had done,

736
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:22,345
I snapped.

737
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,308
When your partner comes back,

738
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,769
you're gonna shoot him
in the chest.

739
00:54:29,811 --> 00:54:31,896
And then you're gonna forget
how to breathe.

740
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:35,942
And I hurt those men.

741
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:51,791
And those guys,
they probably had wives.

742
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,418
Kids.

743
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:56,546
That they loved.

744
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:59,841
Just like I love you.

745
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,092
And I do, Charlie.

746
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:03,428
I love you so much.

747
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,513
But when you hurt people...

748
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,808
...you don't just hurt them.

749
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,852
It hurts everyone around them.

750
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:14,731
You don't come back from that.

751
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:18,651
Not ever.

752
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:24,783
Okay, promise me
that you'll never

753
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:26,868
use your gifts to hurt people.

754
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,119
Promise?

755
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:30,955
Promise.

756
00:55:35,001 --> 00:55:36,503
Now, sleep.

757
00:55:36,544 --> 00:55:38,672
Get some sleep, all right?

758
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:42,008
Come here.

759
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,927
- Love you.
- Love you.

760
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:10,846
...Massachusetts fugitive

761
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,539
now suspected

762

is operating under the alias
"Andy McGee."

765
00:56:21,214 --> 00:56:23,550
He has been wanted ever since
being linked to the killing

766
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:26,469
of two federal agents in 2013.

767
00:56:26,511 --> 00:56:28,471
Police say he had been living
in Lewis ton

768
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,140
with his wife and daughter,

769
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:32,892
and asked the public, if they
come in contact with Cooper,

770
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:34,728
to contact the police
immediately.

771
00:56:34,769 --> 00:56:37,564
We'll have the full details
on this story and more

772
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:40,483
on our next news update.

773

is operating under the alias

to contact the police imm...

784
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:13,183
Hey, Irv.

785
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:14,642
It's not true.

786
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,687
I didn't kill my wife.

787
00:57:18,688 --> 00:57:21,024
You know I didn't kidnap
my daughter either.

788
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:23,651
I don't know shit.

789
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:28,823
You been up all night, Irv?

790
00:57:28,865 --> 00:57:30,825
Coming in my house,

791
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:33,078
eating my food,

792
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,288
drink my beer,

793
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,957
and all the time,
you were a goddamn wife killer!

794
00:57:37,999 --> 00:57:39,584
I didn't kill her.

795
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:40,728
Does my daughter seem
upset with me in any way?

796
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:42,003
Does she seem scared of me?

797
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,672
I'm trying to protect her.

798
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:45,131
I'm trying to protect her
from them.

799
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:48,593
You telling me
I-I can't trust the TV?

800
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:50,512
Shocker, I know.

801
00:57:57,686 --> 00:57:59,270
Irv, come on, man.

802
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:04,859
I know what happened.

803
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,529
What are you talking about?

804
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,739
You were driving that day,
and you were arguing.

805
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:12,200
It got out of control,
and you hit a car head-on.

806
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,829
That's how she got hurt.

807
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,206
That's how Justin died.

808
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,751
Essi told me.

809
00:58:21,793 --> 00:58:23,628
Told you?

810
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,714
That's why they're after us.

811
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:29,843
But there's something else.

812
00:58:29,884 --> 00:58:33,555
Something she's been wanting
to tell you for 30 years.

813
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:38,643
She forgives you.

814
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:41,688
You've hated yourself
all this time.

815
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,773
It was an accident.

816
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,945
And she forgives you.

817
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,997
What is that?

818
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,165
Uh, I called them.

819
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,000
The police.

820
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,627
When I s-saw the news.

821
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:06,338
Oh, my God.

822
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:10,091
Like I said,
I-I overreact sometimes.

823
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:23,980
You two hide.

824
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:25,357
I-I'll take care of this.

825
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:26,900
What are you talking about, Irv?

826
00:59:26,941 --> 00:59:29,069
You're drunk.

827
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,864
Ought to make this
interesting, then.

828
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:36,076
Aaron Jeffery Cooper!

829
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:38,787
- Surrender!
- Hide in there.

830
00:59:38,828 --> 00:59:41,956
Girl inside,
hands on top of your head!

831
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:45,168
Come on out, now.

832
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:48,963
Mr. Cooper!

833
00:59:54,302 --> 00:59:56,763
Hey, I-I'm sorry, Wendell.

834
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:58,765
I was mistaken.

835
00:59:58,807 --> 01:00:01,726
I thought I saw the man
and the girl, but I was wrong.

836
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:04,938
You sounded pretty convinced
on the phone, Irv.

837
01:00:04,979 --> 01:00:07,273
Y-You know, just last month,

838
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:12,028
I saw this documentary on TV
about, um,

839
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,824
uh, I-I can't recall
the exact name,

840
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:19,869
but i-it was something like
"walking dreaming."

841
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:24,958
There was this guy on there
dreamt he swallowed a cockroach

842
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,670
and he jumped up and made
himself puke. -

843
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,797
- It seemed so real.
- It's all right.

844
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,970
No, Charlie, Charlie.

845
01:00:37,012 --> 01:00:38,888
Hey, stay with me,
stay with me, stay with me.

846
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,850
Just breathe. Breathe.

847
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:42,976
Breathe. That's right.

848
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:46,104
I feel something.

849
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:47,313
What?

850
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,276
Someone's here.

851
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,862
You saying you called us out
on account of a dream?

852
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:55,280
A pretty convincing one, too.

853
01:00:55,321 --> 01:00:58,116
Uh, uh, the news was on,

854
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:00,326
I-I drifted off, and...

855
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,830
...and I'm drunk.

856
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:05,457
Want to know what I think?

857
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,293
Not particularly.

858
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:11,129
I think we're here,
and this man Cooper,

859
01:01:11,171 --> 01:01:12,839
he's considerably dangerous.

860
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,966
So even if you were
just dreaming it, Irv,

861
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:16,301
we'd like to search your...

862
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:19,179
Shit! Shit!

863
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:20,847
Officer down!

864
01:01:20,889 --> 01:01:22,809
- We need back up now! Now!
- I see him!

865
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,060
Tree line!

866
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:47,540
Breathe, okay?

867
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:49,060
- He killed Mommy.
- Just breathe, Charlie.

868
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:50,085
No, Charlie.

869
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:51,920
Charlie! Charlie! No!

870
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:07,268
I'm so sorry.

871
01:02:17,904 --> 01:02:20,281
Charlie, do you remember
what I taught you?

872
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:23,284
- Keep running.
- Yeah.

873
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:34,838
I love you, Daddy.

874
01:02:34,879 --> 01:02:36,548
I love you, too, sweetheart.

875
01:02:36,589 --> 01:02:37,924
Now, run.

876
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:39,968
Run!

877
01:03:21,217 --> 01:03:22,594
Very clever.

878
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:48,870
Gotcha.

879
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:02,258
They will never stop
until they have her.

880
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,177
You'll never catch her.

881
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:21,653
Lenses in. Lenses in.

882
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:25,031
Containment
team has arrived on site.

883
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:26,366
Beginning perimeter search now.

884
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:28,159
Subject's down.

885
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:29,994
Everybody's down.

886
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:31,538
Except him.

887
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:33,373
On your knees! Move in.

888
01:04:33,415 --> 01:04:35,375
- Move!
- Careful.

889
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:36,626
He's dangerous.

890
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:41,381
Give me your gun.

891
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:43,049
No dice, freak.

892
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,301
We've got protection.

893
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:48,596
Any sign of her?

894
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,098
Negative.

895
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,409
We're checking
the other structures.

896
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,435
We found the owners inside.

897
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:23,173
You lost her, Rainbird.

898
01:05:23,214 --> 01:05:25,300
You left a trail of dead cops
in your wake.

899
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,093
You call that discretion?

900
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:28,595
You have the father.

901
01:05:28,636 --> 01:05:30,013
So she's just gonna what?

902
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,723
She's gonna feel her way here?

903
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:33,475
They are connected.

904
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,060
She will come for him.

905
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,648
Retirement has made you
sloppy and soft.

906
01:05:43,234 --> 01:05:45,320
Is that why you blindfold me?

907
01:05:48,573 --> 01:05:51,993
I don't need to see your eyes
to feel your fear.

908
01:05:57,123 --> 01:05:59,167
You don't know what I feel.

909
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:04,255
She will come for him.

910
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:06,132
She will come for us all.

911
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:09,135
She is my sister.

912
01:06:09,177 --> 01:06:11,012
My mother.

913
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:14,683
Well, you killed her mother.

914
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:18,228
She will be your death.

915
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:20,313
A fate which I deserve.

916
01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:25,527
When you see her,
you will understand.

917
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:04,482
Where are you, Daddy?

918
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:09,070
Tell me.

919
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,419
Rise and shine, Mr. McGee.

920
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,713
Or is it Mr. Burton?

921
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:28,757
Mr. Rozelle?

922
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:34,262
No more pseudonyms, Cooper.

923
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:38,725
No more running.

924
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:42,354
It's just you and me now.

925
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:52,697
Wake up.

926
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:04,584
Rainbird... the man
who killed your poor wife...

927
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:07,837
He believes that
you and your daughter,

928
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:12,133
you have some kind of
a spiritual connection.

929
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:15,345
Telepathy.

930
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:19,224
Lot Six is full of surprises.

931
01:08:20,308 --> 01:08:21,851
Tell me where she is.

932
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,815
Charlie is out there all alone.

933
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,319
Without you, her emotions
will get the best of her.

934
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:33,655
And what happens
when she gets upset?

935
01:08:33,697 --> 01:08:35,448
She gets scared.

936
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:39,494
She is going to blow some
poor bastard to smithereens.

937
01:08:39,536 --> 01:08:41,287
She's gonna be killing people.

938
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:43,915
How's she gonna live with that?

939
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:48,670
Bring her here.

940
01:08:52,424 --> 01:08:54,718
What other choice do you have?

941
01:09:18,742 --> 01:09:21,494
Charlie.

942
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:23,496
Charlie.

943
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:25,290
Daddy?

944
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:44,327
I'm coming, Daddy.

945
01:10:45,453 --> 01:10:47,497
I'll find you.

946
01:11:44,137 --> 01:11:47,015
- What happened to your clothes?
- What happened to your face?

947
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:58,401
Don't you ever bathe, weirdo?

948
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:03,823
I'd like your bike.

949
01:12:03,865 --> 01:12:06,159
Please.

950
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:18,129
The hell are you doing, Dale?

951
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:51,663
Which way is the coast?

952
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:56,418
The coast, dummies,
where the water is.

953
01:13:48,636 --> 01:13:50,096
So let me know

954
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:52,338
- what the final numbers are.
- All right, will do.

955
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:03,068
I mean, how's the nausea today?

956
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:05,570
Sorry, babe.

957
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:08,114
I mean, first trimester's
almost over, right?

958
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:10,176
The light at the end of
the tunnel. -

959
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,827
Yeah.

960
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:14,764
All right. I'll see you
when I get home. Love you.

961
01:14:14,788 --> 01:14:16,581
Bye.

962
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,505
It's you.

963
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:26,758
Take your hand off the key.

964
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,679
Give me your phone.

965
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:35,558
And the card.

966
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:46,027
Do you have a gun...

967
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,864
- ...Agent Jules?
- No.

968
01:14:49,906 --> 01:14:52,951
Uh, I'm just a tech.
They don't let us carry guns.

969
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:54,703
This says you're an agent.

970
01:14:56,246 --> 01:14:58,998
We're all agents.
It's just... just a title.

971
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,959
Is my father inside?

972
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:03,895
I don't know.

973
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,672
- Is he?
- I don't know.

974
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:07,316
I swear, okay? I don't have
that kind of clearance.

975
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,009
I don't want to hurt you, sir.

976
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:10,635
Please, why are you doing this?

977
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,178
Is my father inside?

978
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:14,264
I don't know! Okay?

979
01:15:14,305 --> 01:15:16,224
Stop. Please.

980
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:19,019
If he's here, he'll be, uh,
he'll be at the bottom.

981
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,353
Who else is in there?

982
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:23,690
Computer techs, s-scientists,

983
01:15:23,732 --> 01:15:25,191
uh, that kind of thing.

984
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:27,569
No long-haired men?

985
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:30,697
Answer me!

986
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:32,115
Please, just...

987
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:34,117
Okay, just stay calm.

988
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,870
- We can work something...
- Tell me!

989
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:38,580
No!

990
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:51,217
You said you didn't have a gun.

991
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:58,350
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I promised.

992
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,270
He's in pain, Charlie.

993
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:06,274
You'll have to put him
out of his misery.

994
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:09,235
This is what it costs.

995
01:16:20,705 --> 01:16:23,041
What's going on?

996
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,834
Ah, shit.

997
01:16:26,127 --> 01:16:28,254
We got a disturbance
in the east lot.

998
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:29,756
All units stand by.

999
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:52,821
She's inside the building.

1000
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:55,222
Clearing her path
to the restricted level now.

1001
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:11,131
What the...?

1002
01:17:11,172 --> 01:17:13,216
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1003
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:50,337
Daddy.

1004
01:18:06,394 --> 01:18:08,438
She's on the restricted level.

1005
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:12,984
Oh, come on.

1006
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:25,163
She's headed your way, B team.

1007
01:18:39,886 --> 01:18:42,263
Asset moving down hallway 12.

1008
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:46,184
Passing her off to beta team.

1009
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:48,812
We've got her.

1010
01:18:48,853 --> 01:18:50,772
Target visual acquired.

1011
01:18:50,814 --> 01:18:53,024
Securing hallways
and doors behind her.

1012
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:56,319
She's all yours, Cap.

1013
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,121
Daddy!

1014
01:19:07,163 --> 01:19:09,165
Daddy, wake up!

1015
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:13,461
Daddy, wake up.

1016
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,007
Charlie?

1017
01:19:18,216 --> 01:19:19,884
Wh-Why-Why are you here?

1018
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:24,014
I came. I got your message.

1019
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:29,561
That wasn't me, Charlie.

1020
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:35,316
I would never bring you here.

1021
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:38,945
That wasn't me.

1022
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:41,281
- But I can get you out.
- No.

1023
01:19:41,322 --> 01:19:43,616
No, Charlie.

1024
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:46,286
There's no getting out.

1025
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,331
- There's no getting out for me.
- Charlie.

1026
01:19:51,332 --> 01:19:53,918
It wasn't supposed to be
this way.

1027
01:19:54,919 --> 01:19:57,380
Wasn't supposed to be
this difficult.

1028
01:19:58,590 --> 01:20:00,342
Stay calm, dear.

1029
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,470
If you try to burn me,
you'll burn your daddy, too.

1030
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:06,056
My name's Captain Hollister,

1031
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:08,933
but you can call me Cap.

1032
01:20:08,975 --> 01:20:10,977
I run this facility.

1033
01:20:11,019 --> 01:20:13,021
You can trust me, Charlie.

1034
01:20:14,689 --> 01:20:16,649
You'll be safe here.
You'll be protected.

1035
01:20:16,691 --> 01:20:20,487
We'll take really good care
of you and your father.

1036
01:20:20,528 --> 01:20:22,322
My dad needs a doctor.

1037
01:20:22,364 --> 01:20:25,158
They've seen him
already, Charlie.

1038
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,659
Microhemorrhages.

1039
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:30,455
His brain bleeds
when he uses his power.

1040
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:34,585
The same thing could happen
to you, too, Charlie,

1041
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:37,629
but we can teach you.

1042
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:40,006
- It's what your mother wanted.
- No.

1043
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,257
No.

1044
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:45,053
Call a doctor right now,

1045
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:47,347
or I'll hurt myself.

1046
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:52,143
Don't do it, Charlie.
Don't do it.

1047
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,898
Call a doctor right now.

1048
01:20:57,732 --> 01:20:59,275
Do it!

1049
01:21:12,372 --> 01:21:15,083
You're a very determined
young lady.

1050
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,711
Use it wisely,
it'll take you far in this life.

1051
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:19,421
I should know.

1052
01:21:19,462 --> 01:21:21,715
You do bad things here.
I can feel it.

1053
01:21:21,756 --> 01:21:23,091
No, we-we do great things.

1054
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,300
We make things better here.

1055
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:26,177
We-we make people better.

1056
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:29,264
We make them stronger,
people like you.

1057
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:30,640
Haven't you realized?

1058
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:35,061
You are a real-life

1059
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:37,272
superhero.

1060
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:39,441
Daddy.

1061
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:42,610
You're very special.

1062
01:21:46,114 --> 01:21:47,699
The world out there...

1063
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:51,161
They don't know
how to handle your power.

1064
01:21:52,162 --> 01:21:54,289
Here, we can handle it.

1065
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:57,208
Because we made you.

1066
01:22:00,795 --> 01:22:02,255
Look at your father.

1067
01:22:05,383 --> 01:22:08,261
They say
if he does one more push,

1068
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:10,430
it might kill him.

1069
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:13,016
You need us.

1070
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:15,518
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1071
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,563
I-I know you don't, honey.
I know.

1072
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:23,360
But we can't run anymore.

1073
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:25,111
I need you
to break your promise.

1074
01:22:25,153 --> 01:22:27,197
Daddy.

1075
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:30,325
You have to burn it down,
starting with us.

1076
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,286
Daddy, what are you...

1077
01:22:35,663 --> 01:22:37,457
I'm sorry to make you do this.

1078
01:22:39,709 --> 01:22:41,461
Burn it all down.

1079
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:44,172
- It's the only way.
- Easy. Easy.

1080
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,467
Burn me, you burn him, too.

1081
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,153
Shit!

1082
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:08,738
Cap's down.

1083
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,365
We got a fire
in the restricted area.

1084
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:12,367
Call in the containment team.

1085
01:23:33,346 --> 01:23:36,307
Evacuate
all non-military staff.

1086
01:23:42,147 --> 01:23:44,649
Evacuate all non-military staff.

1087
01:23:51,489 --> 01:23:54,200
Evacuate all non-military staff.

1088
01:24:00,832 --> 01:24:03,501
Evacuate all non-military staff.

1089
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:20,852
- Stop there!
- It's over!

1090
01:24:32,822 --> 01:24:34,574
Surrender!

1091
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:51,508
Please, please.
I don't want to hurt you.

1092
01:24:51,549 --> 01:24:53,510
I-I can help you.

1093
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:55,637
My name's Gail.

1094
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,391
I... I can lead you
out of here to safety.

1095
01:24:59,432 --> 01:25:01,476
Hmm? Just come with me.

1096
01:25:06,523 --> 01:25:07,899
Please.

1097
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:15,949
No. Please.

1098
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,450
Please, no, no,
please, please, pl...

1099
01:25:17,492 --> 01:25:19,411
Liar, liar,

1100
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:21,371
pants on fire.

1101
01:26:19,804 --> 01:26:20,847
We got her.

1102
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:27,520
It's okay, Charlie.

1102
01:26:28,305 --> 01:27:28,320
