2
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,034
Anna. Elsa.

3
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:01,367
Bedtime soon.

4
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,236
Uh-oh. The princess
is trapped

5
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:04,805
in the snow goblin's
evil spell.

6
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:07,607
Quick, Elsa! Make a prince!
A fancy one!

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,844
Oh, no! The prince
is trapped, too.

8
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:11,679
Who cares about danger

9
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:12,713
when there's love?

10
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,647
Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!

11
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:16,449
Kissing won't save
the Forest.

12
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,821
The lost fairies cry out.

13
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:21,387
What sound
does a giraffe make?

14
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:22,489
Never mind.

15
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,758
They wake
the fairy queen...

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,626
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone!

17
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,063
And they all get married!

18
00:01:29,065 --> 00:01:30,330
What are you playing?

19
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:32,032
Enchanted Forest.

20
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:33,566
The prince
and the princess...

21
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:35,770
Hmm. That's like no enchanted
forest I've ever seen.

22
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:38,706
You've seen
an enchanted forest?

23
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:39,840
Wait, what?

24
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:41,709
I have. Once.

25
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,410
And you've never
told us this before?

26
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:46,515
Well, I could
tell you now, if you...

27
00:01:48,017 --> 00:01:49,850
- Okay. Now.
- Tell us now.

28
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:51,386
Are you sure about this?

29
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,721
It's time they know.

30
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,421
Let's make
a big snowman later.

31
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,959
If they can settle
and listen.

32
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:01,294
Far away...

33
00:02:01,296 --> 00:02:03,296
as north as we can go...

34
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:07,467
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest.

35
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,036
But its magic wasn't that of

36
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,772
goblin spells
and lost fairies.

37
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:14,844
<i>It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all...</i>

38
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:17,046
<i>those of air...</i>

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,781
<i>of fire...</i>

40
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,017
<i>of water...</i>

41
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:23,618
<i>and earth.</i>

42
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:29,824
<i>But it was also home</i>

43
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:32,226
<i>to the mysterious
Northuldra people.</i>

44
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:34,762
<i>Were the
Northuldra magical, like me?</i>

45
00:02:34,764 --> 00:02:37,530
<i>No, Elsa.
They were not magical.</i>

46
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,903
<i>They just took advantage
of the Forest's gifts.</i>

47
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:44,705
<i>Their ways
were so different from ours...</i>

48
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:47,542
<i>but still,
they promised us friendship.</i>

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,409
<i>In honor of that,</i>

50
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:51,377
<i>your grandfather,
King Runeard,</i>

51
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,013
<i>built them a mighty dam...</i>

52
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,982
<i>to strengthen their waters.</i>

53
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:56,416
<i>It was a gift of peace.</i>

54
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:59,019
<i>That's a big gift of peace.</i>

55
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,386
<i>And I was so honored</i>

56
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,388
<i>to get to go to the Forest
to celebrate it.</i>

57
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,726
Stand tall, Agnarr.

58
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:06,193
<i>I wasn't
at all prepared</i>

59
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:07,897
<i>for what the day would bring.</i>

60
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,901
<i>We let down our guard.</i>

61
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:15,370
<i>We were charmed.</i>

62
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:16,839
Whoa. Whoa!

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,174
<i>It felt so...</i>

64
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:21,376
<i>magical.</i>

65
00:03:35,624 --> 00:03:37,425
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

66
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,163
<i>They were attacking us.</i>

67
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,065
Get behind me.

68
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,568
<i>It was
a brutal battle.</i>

69
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,136
<i>Your grandfather...</i>

70
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:50,204
Father!

71
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>...was lost.</i>

72
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,605
Aah!

73
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,576
<i>The fighting
enraged the spirits.</i>

74
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:56,944
Look out!

75
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,148
<i>They turned
their magic against us all.</i>

76
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,193
<i>There was this voice...</i>

77
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,500
<i>...and someone saved me.</i>

78
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:25,105
<i>I'm told the spirits
then vanished.</i>

79
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:29,109
<i>And a powerful mist
covered the Forest.</i>

80
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,247
<i>Locking everyone out.</i>

81
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:40,655
And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle.

82
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,193
Whoa, Papa, that was epic.

83
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,329
Whoever saved you,

84
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,463
I love them.

85
00:04:50,465 --> 00:04:52,700
I wish I knew
who it was.

86
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,600
What happened to the spirits?

87
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:56,203
What's in the Forest now?

88
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:57,771
I don't know.

89
00:04:57,773 --> 00:05:00,374
The mist
still stands.

90
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:02,309
No one
can get in.

91
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,211
And no one
has since come out.

92
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:05,679
So we're safe.

93
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,747
Yes.

94
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:08,449
But the Forest
could wake again.

95
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:12,652
And we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring.

96
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:13,954
And on that note,

97
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:15,588
how about we say good night
to your father?

98
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,293
But I still
have so many questions.

99
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,995
Save them
for another night, Anna.

100
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:23,966
You know I don't
have that kind of patience.

101
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:27,935
Why did Northuldra
attack us anyway?

102
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:30,004
Who attacks people
who give them gifts?

103
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:32,975
Do you think the
Forest will wake again?

104
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:37,179
Only Ahtohallan knows.

105
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:39,215
Octa-who-what?

106
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:43,684
When I was little...

107
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,952
my mother
would sing a song

108
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:47,988
about a special river
called Ahtohallan...

109
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,225
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past.

110
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,093
About what we are
a part of.

111
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,161
Wow.

112
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:56,298
Will you sing it
for us? Please?

113
00:05:57,967 --> 00:05:58,999
Okay.

114
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,834
Cuddle close.

115
00:06:00,836 --> 00:06:03,172

They're ready.

Excuse me.

00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:00,122
I'm coming.

What?

Never mind.

Enjoying
your new permafrost, Olaf?

I'm just living
the dream, Anna.

148

How I wish

149
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:37,960
- this could last forever.
- Mmm.

150
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:41,495
And yet, change mocks us
with her beauty.

151

What's that?

152

Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic.

153
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:47,734
Tell me, you're older
and thus all-knowing...

154
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,836
do you ever worry
about the notion that...

155
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,705
nothing is permanent?

156
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:53,574
Uh... No.

157
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:54,908
Really?

158
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,679
Wow, I can't wait until
I'm ancient like you...

159
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:00,847
so I don't have to worry
about important things.

160
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:02,716
That's not what I mean.

161
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,751
I don't worry because...

162
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,555
well, I have you and Elsa
and Kristoff and Sven...

163
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:11,024

Uh, nothing?

255
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,825

Um, worried? Panicking?
Disturbed?

266
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,810
Oh, come on,

267
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,410

Yeah, I'm tired, too.

275
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,157
And Sven promised
to read me a bedtime story.

276
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,960
Didn't you, Sven?

277
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,027
Did I?

278
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:16,196
Oh, you do
the best voices!

279
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:18,699

282
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,905
Um, how about you guys

283
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:25,607

284
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,178
Ugh.

285
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,147
Did Elsa seem weird
to you?

286
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,984
- She seemed like Elsa.
- Hmm.

287
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:38,385
That last word

288
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,453
really seemed to throw her.
What was it?

289
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,155
- I don't know. Ahem.
- No. No.

290
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:43,826

- Ah.

291

Oh, come on!

293
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:49,195
She couldn't act out ice?

294
00:14:49,197 --> 00:14:50,965
- I better go check on her.
- Uh...

295
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,802

- Hmm?

Come in.

299
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,147
Yep. Something's wrong.

300
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:09,050
- With you?
- No, with you.

301
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:11,052
You're wearing
Mother's scarf.

302

You do that
when something's wrong.

303
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,088
Did we hurt
your feelings?

304
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,556
I'm so sorry if we did.

305
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:18,993
You know, very few people are
actually good at family games.

306
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:20,061
That's just a fact.

No, that's not it.

308
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,099
Then, what is it?

309
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:28,270
There's this...

310
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,008

00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:31,073
The water!

370
00:20:39,282 --> 00:20:42,283
The air rages,
no fire, no water.

371
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:43,884
The earth is next.

372
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:44,887
We have to get out.

373
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,431
It'll be okay.
Evacuate to the cliffs.

374
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:02,836
Oh, no!
I'm gonna blow!

375
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:04,439
I've got you!

376
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:14,915
Yes.
Everyone's out and safe.

377
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,318
- Here. Take one of these.
- Huh?

378
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,584
You okay there, Olaf?

379
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,387
Oh, yeah.
We're calling this...

380
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:24,258
"controlling what you can when
things feel out of control."

381
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,658
Okay, I don't understand.

382
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,328
You've been hearing
a voice

383
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,296
and you didn't think
to tell me?

384
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,731
I didn't want to worry you.

385
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:33,535
We made a promise not
to shut each other out.

386
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,005
Just tell me
what's going on.

387
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:41,442
I woke the magical spirits
at the Enchanted Forest.

388
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:42,642
Okay, that's
definitely not

389
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,278
what I thought
you were gonna say.

390
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,847
Wait. The Enchanted Forest?

391
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,816
The one
Father warned us about?

392
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:49,683
Yes.

393
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:51,251
Why would you do that?

394
00:21:51,253 --> 00:21:53,653
Because of the voice.

395
00:21:53,655 --> 00:21:56,589
I know it sounds crazy...

396
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:59,659
but I believe whoever
is calling me is good.

397
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:02,062
How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom.

398
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:06,499
I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it.

399
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:08,070
I can feel it.

400
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,503
Okay.

401
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:13,606
Oh, no. What now?

402
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,376
The Trolls?

403
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:18,280
- Kristoff! We missed you!
- Oh!

404
00:22:19,015 --> 00:22:20,214
Pabbie.

405
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:23,250
Well, never a dull moment
with you two.

406
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:26,286
I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa.

407
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:30,157
Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart.

408
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,992
Why are they still angry?

409
00:22:31,994 --> 00:22:34,428
What does all of this
have to do with Arendelle?

410
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,232
Let me see
what I can see.

411
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:42,705
The past is not
what it seems.

412
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:46,373
A wrong demands to be righted.

413
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,410
Arendelle is not safe.

414
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:52,980
The truth must be found.

415
00:22:52,982 --> 00:22:54,083
Without it...

416
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,585
I see no future.

417
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,686
No future?

418
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,955
When one can see
no future...

419
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:06,126
all one can do
is the next right thing.

420
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:08,095
The next right thing

421
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:10,030
is for me to go
to the Enchanted Forest...

422
00:23:10,032 --> 00:23:11,664
and find that voice.

423
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,866
Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon

424
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:14,034
- and Sven?
- Hmm?

425
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:15,635
I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that.

426
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,871
- You are not going alone.
- Anna, no.

427
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:20,573
I have my powers
to protect me. You don't.

428
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,276
Excuse me, I climbed
the North Mountain...

429
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:23,444
survived a frozen heart,

430
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,511
and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend...

431
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:25,846
and I did it
all without powers,

432
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:27,448
so, you know, I'm coming.

433
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,782
Me, too. I'll drive.

434
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:30,484
I'll bring the snacks!

435
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:32,553
I will look
after your people.

436
00:23:32,555 --> 00:23:33,653
Please make sure they stay

437
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:35,289
out of the kingdom
until we return.

438
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,790
Of course.

439
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,425
Let's let them know.

440
00:23:38,427 --> 00:23:41,361
Anna, I am worried
for her.

441
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:42,763
We have always feared

442
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:45,532
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

443
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:49,071
Now, we must pray
they are enough.

444
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,942
I won't let anything
happen to her.

445
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:54,944
Hyah!

446
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,280
Who's into trivia?

447
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:01,849
I am. Okay.

448
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:04,518
Did you know that water
has memory? True fact.

449
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,720
It's disputed by many,
but it's true.

450
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:08,021
Did you know
men are six times

451
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:09,723
more likely to be
struck by lightning?

452
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,925
Did you know gorillas
burp when they're happy?

453
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,528
Did you know we blink
four million times a day?

454
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,497
Did you know
wombats poop squares?

455
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,798
Did you know
sleeping quietly

456
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,502
on long journeys
prevents insanity?

457
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,503
- Yeah, that's not true.
- It is.

458
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:23,704
- It's true.
- Definitely true.

459
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,139
No, it's the truth.

460
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:26,773
Well,
that was unanimous.

461
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,711
But I will look it up
when we get home.

462
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:33,046
They're both asleep.

463
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:36,118
So, what do you
wanna do?

464
00:24:38,154 --> 00:24:41,157
Sven, keep us steady,
will ya?

465
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,825
- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem.

466
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:45,959
- Anna?
- Mm-hmm?

467
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,828
Remember
our first trip like this...

468
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,963
when I said
you'd have to be crazy

469
00:24:49,965 --> 00:24:51,765
to want to marry
a man you just met?

470
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:53,400
Wait, what? Crazy?

471
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:56,170
You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

472
00:24:56,172 --> 00:24:57,738
No. I did.

473
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,573
- You were...
- Huh?

474
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:00,774
...not crazy.

475
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:02,209
Clearly.

476
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,844
Just naive.

477
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:07,347
Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was.

478
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:11,952
And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong.

479
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:13,987
So you're saying
I'm wrong for you.

480
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:16,056
What? No, no.
I'm not saying

481
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,659
you're wrong, or crazy.

482
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:20,894
- Kristoff, stop. Please.
- Good idea.

483
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,596
I hear it.
I hear the voice.

484
00:25:22,598 --> 00:25:24,565
You do?

485
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,603
Olaf, wake up.

486
00:25:30,372 --> 00:25:32,474
- Whoa.
- Wow.

487
00:25:56,632 --> 00:25:58,534
Whoa! What the...

488
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:19,021
Whoa.

489
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,829
Promise me,
we do this together, okay?

490
00:26:28,831 --> 00:26:30,332
I promise.

491
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,108
It's okay.

492
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,477
Did you know
that an enchanted forest

493
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:45,078
is a place
of transformation?

494
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,014
I have no idea
what that means...

495
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:48,882
but I can't wait to see

496
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:52,554
what it's gonna do
to each one of us.

497
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,188
- Hey!
- What is this?

498
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,691
- No pushing.
- Stop it.

499
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:58,027
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's too fast.

500
00:26:58,594 --> 00:26:59,696
What was that?

501
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:03,365
No. No, no, no.

502
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:07,034
And we're locked in.

503
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:09,038
Probably should have seen
that one coming.

504
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,375
This forest is beautiful.

505
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,210
Ooh.

506
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:42,804
The dam. It still stands.

507
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,639
It was
in Grand Pabbie's visions.

508
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,140
But why?

509
00:27:47,142 --> 00:27:49,976
I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness.

510
00:27:49,978 --> 00:27:51,078
What do you mean?

511
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,279
Well, if that dam broke...

512
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:54,314
it would send
a tidal wave so big

513
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:56,883
it would wash away
everything on this fjord.

514
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,285
Everything?

515
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:00,822
But Arendelle's
on this fjord.

516
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:02,956
Nothing's gonna happen
to Arendelle, Anna.

517
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,458
It's gonna be fine.

518
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,195
Come here.

519
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:14,401
You know,
under different circumstances,

520
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,871
this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place.

521
00:28:17,873 --> 00:28:18,939
Don't you think?

522
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:20,006
Different circumstances?

523
00:28:20,008 --> 00:28:21,408
You mean,
like with someone else?

524
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,043
What? No! No.

525
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,411
I'm saying...

526
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,813
Just in case we don't
make it out of here...

527
00:28:25,815 --> 00:28:27,013
Wait, what?

528
00:28:27,015 --> 00:28:28,415
You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?

529
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,751
No. No!

530
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,284
I mean, no,
we will make it out of here.

531
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:32,787
Well, technically the odds
are kind of complicated,

532
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:34,388
but my point is...

533
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,622
In case we die...

534
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:38,024
- You think we're gonna die?
- No! No, no, no.

535
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,292
- Where's Elsa?
- We will die at some point.

536
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:40,427
I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side.

537
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:41,863
Not in any
recent time will we die.

538
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:43,363
- Elsa!
- But way far in the future,

539
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:44,533
we will die.

540
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,639
Don't patronize me.

541
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:00,748
Elsa!

542
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,082
There you are.

543
00:29:02,084 --> 00:29:04,351
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

544
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:06,021
Okay, good.

545
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,157
Where's Olaf?

546
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,556
Um...

547
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:10,626
Anna?

548
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:12,559
Elsa?

549
00:29:12,561 --> 00:29:14,096
Sven?

550
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,231
Samantha?

551
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,503
I don't even know
a Samantha.

552
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,708
Whoa!

553
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:29,378
Mm.

554
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:33,683
That's normal.

555
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:48,197
What was that?

556
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:50,365
Samantha?

557
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:59,473

00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:26,729
- Whoa!
- Olaf!

579
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,800
Hey, guys.

580
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:34,570
Meet the Wind Spirit.

581
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,204
Coming through!

582
00:31:38,206 --> 00:31:39,573
Ooh, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

583
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:42,578
I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms.

584
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:52,421
Hey! Stop!

585
00:32:04,499 --> 00:32:05,500
Elsa!

586
00:32:08,637 --> 00:32:10,372
Let her go!

587
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:16,144
Anna,
be careful!

588
00:32:16,713 --> 00:32:18,380
That's my sister!

589
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,453
Prince Agnarr!

590
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,992
For Arendelle.

591
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:32,895
Look out!

592
00:32:34,363 --> 00:32:35,798
Father!

593
00:32:44,907 --> 00:32:47,110
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

594
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,911
What are these?

595
00:32:50,913 --> 00:32:54,949
Oh, they look like
moments in time.

596
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:56,817
What's that thing
you say, Olaf?

597
00:32:56,819 --> 00:32:58,284
The thing... Oh!

598
00:32:58,286 --> 00:33:00,286
My theory about
advancing technologies

599
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,689
as both our savior
and our doom?

600
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:04,157
No, not that one.
The one about...

601
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,392
- The one about cucumbers?
- No.

602
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:06,459
The thing about water.

603
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,096
Oh! Yeah.
Water has memory.

604
00:33:09,098 --> 00:33:10,664
The water that
makes up you and me

605
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,900
has passed through
at least four humans...

606
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,837
and/or animals before us.

607
00:33:15,772 --> 00:33:17,071
Hmm.

608
00:33:17,073 --> 00:33:19,541
And remembers everything.

609
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:22,877
The wind's back.

610
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:25,112
Delicious.

611
00:33:25,114 --> 00:33:27,917
I think
I'll name you Gale.

612
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:32,086
Get out of there. Whoa!

613
00:33:32,088 --> 00:33:34,090
- Oh. Hi.
- Aren't you curious?

614
00:33:35,792 --> 00:33:37,960
You in a better mood now?

615
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:51,440
Father.
That's Father.

616
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:54,775
This girl.

617
00:33:54,777 --> 00:33:56,911
She's saving him.

618
00:33:56,913 --> 00:33:58,181
She's Northuldra.

619
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,116
What is that?

620
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:03,920
Olaf, get behind me.

621
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:07,888
What are you gonna
do with that?

622
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,058
I have no idea.

623
00:34:22,939 --> 00:34:24,671
Lower your weapon.

624
00:34:24,673 --> 00:34:27,307
And you lower yours.

625
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:29,442
Arendellian soldiers?

626
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:31,377
Threatening my people,
Lieutenant?

627
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,181
Invading my dance space,
Yelena?

628
00:34:34,183 --> 00:34:35,348
Why does that soldier
look so familiar?

629
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,751
No, no, no.

630
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:37,818
Lieutenant!

631
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,755
Get the sword!

632
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,328
That was magic.

633
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,830
Did you see that?

634
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:51,999
Of course I saw it.

635
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:53,633
You chose a nice,
cold greeting.

636
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,468
They've been trapped in
here this whole time?

637
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,138
- Yeah.
- What do we do now?

638
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,340
I got this.

639
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:00,076
Hi, I'm Olaf.

640
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:05,012
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting.

641
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:07,248
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here.

642
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,116
It's really quite simple.

643
00:35:09,118 --> 00:35:11,417
It began with two sisters.

644
00:35:11,419 --> 00:35:13,286
One born with magical powers.

645
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:14,688
One born powerless.

646
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,623
Their love of snowmen,
infinite.

647
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:18,291
Anna, no! Too high!

648
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:19,526
Blast!

649
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:21,262
Mama! Papa! Help!

650
00:35:21,264 --> 00:35:23,396
Slam!
Doors shutting everywhere.

651
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:25,465
Sisters torn apart.

652
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:27,567
Well, at least
they have their parents.

653
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:29,435
Their parents are dead.

654
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:31,371
Oh.
Oh, hi. I'm Anna.

655
00:35:31,373 --> 00:35:32,706
I'll marry a man I just met.

656
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,175
Elsa's gonna blow!

657
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:36,543
Snow! Snow! Aah, run!

658
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:38,779
Magic pulses
through my snowflakes.

659
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:40,346
I live.

660
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,117
Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one.

661
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,852
Get out, Anna.
Pew! Pew!

662
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:46,987
- My heart.
- Oh, my goodness.

663
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,823
Only an act
of true love can save you.

664
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:50,860
Here's
a true love's kiss.

665
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,993
You're not worth it.

666
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,627
Guess what?
I'm the bad guy.

667
00:35:54,629 --> 00:35:56,063
What?

668
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:59,233
And Anna
freezes to death forever.

669
00:35:59,235 --> 00:36:00,903
Oh, Anna.

670
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:02,837
Then she unfreezes!

671
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:04,537
Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits...

672
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:06,006
and we were forced
out of our kingdom.

673
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:07,574
Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past...

674
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:09,043
but we don't have a clue
how to do that...

675
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:10,410
except Elsa's hearing voices,

676
00:36:10,412 --> 00:36:11,912
so we got that going for us.

677
00:36:11,914 --> 00:36:13,448
Any questions?

678
00:36:16,185 --> 00:36:17,854
I think they got it.

679
00:36:19,354 --> 00:36:21,222
Are you really
Queen of Arendelle?

680
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:22,388
I am.

681
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,556
Why would nature reward

682
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:25,525
a person of Arendelle
with magic?

683
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:27,895
Perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people.

684
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,596
My people are innocent.

685
00:36:29,598 --> 00:36:31,631
We would have never
attacked first.

686
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,200
May the truth be found.

687
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:35,368
- Mm...
- Hi. I'm sorry.

688
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,204
- Uh, what's happening?
- Hmm.

689
00:36:37,206 --> 00:36:39,372
That's it.
Lieutenant Mattias!

690
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:41,208
Library, second portrait
on the left.

691
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:43,578
You were our father's
official guard.

692
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,746
Agnarr.

693
00:36:45,748 --> 00:36:47,647
What did happen
to your parents?

694
00:36:47,649 --> 00:36:50,918
Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern Sea...

695
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,021
six years ago.

696
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:59,960
I see him.
I see him in your faces.

697
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,028
Really?

698
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,495
Soldiers.

699
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:05,498
We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong.

700
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,837
And proud to serve Arendelle.

701
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:11,038
Wait. Please.

702
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,107
Someone has called me here.

703
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:15,242
If I can just find them...

704
00:37:15,244 --> 00:37:16,476
I believe
they have the answers

705
00:37:16,478 --> 00:37:19,412
that may help us
free this forest.

706
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:21,648
Trust me,
I just want to help.

707
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,151
We only trust nature.

708
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:25,888
When nature speaks...

709
00:37:28,456 --> 00:37:29,656
...we listen.

710
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:31,894
This will all
make sense when I'm older.

711
00:37:33,528 --> 00:37:34,830
Fire Spirit!

712
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:38,065
Get back, everyone!

713
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,936
Head for the river!

714
00:37:49,845 --> 00:37:52,212
No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!

715
00:37:52,214 --> 00:37:53,215
Come on, Sven!

716
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:55,184
We'll get them.

717
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,022
Elsa! Get out of there!

718
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,991
No, no, no.

719
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:08,097
Elsa!

720
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:22,078
Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!

721
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:27,917
Anna!

722
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:34,355
Oh!

723
00:38:34,357 --> 00:38:35,521
Get her out of here.

724
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,893
No! Elsa!

725
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,070
They're all looking at us,
aren't they?

726
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:57,306
Got any advice?

727
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,375
Nothing?

728
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:03,578
Hmm. Should I know
what that means?

729
00:40:06,315 --> 00:40:08,682
You hear it, too.

730
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:10,751
Somebody's calling us.

731
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:13,422
Who is it?
What do we do?

732
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:23,999
Okay, keep going north.

733
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:27,801
Elsa!

734
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,036
- Oh, thank goodness!
- Anna.

735
00:40:29,038 --> 00:40:31,171
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

736
00:40:31,173 --> 00:40:32,272
You could've been killed.

737
00:40:32,274 --> 00:40:34,441
You can't just follow me
into fire.

738
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:36,642
You don't want me
to follow you into fire,

739
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,645
then don't run into fire.

740
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:42,685
You're not
being careful, Elsa.

741
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,521
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

742
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:49,523
I've been better.

743
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:52,695
Hmm. I know
what you need.

744
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:57,733
Where did you
get that scarf?

745
00:40:58,501 --> 00:41:00,467
That's a Northuldra scarf.

746
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:01,634
What?

747
00:41:01,636 --> 00:41:04,571
This is from one of
our oldest families.

748
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:06,208
It was our mother's.

749
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,617
Elsa.

750
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,018
I see it.

751
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,154
It's Mother.

752
00:41:20,156 --> 00:41:23,425
Mother saved
Father's life that day.

753
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:29,698
Our mother was Northuldra.

754
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:32,993
We are called Northuldra.

755
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:36,165
We are the people of the sun.

756
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:41,835
I promise you I will
free this forest...

757
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:43,339
and restore Arendelle.

758
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,542
That's a pretty
big promise, Elsa.

759
00:42:48,177 --> 00:42:51,113
Free the Forest?
Wow.

760
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:52,680
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:54,448
It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,

762
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,583
we've never even seen
a clear sky.

763
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:57,784
I get it.

764
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,753
- The name's Ryder.
- Kristoff.

765
00:42:59,755 --> 00:43:01,321
I heard the voice again.

766
00:43:01,323 --> 00:43:02,789
We need to go north.

767
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,225
But the Earth Giants now
roam the north at night.

768
00:43:05,227 --> 00:43:07,427
You can leave
in the morning.

769
00:43:07,429 --> 00:43:08,595
I'm Honeymaren.

770
00:43:08,597 --> 00:43:11,000
Honeymaren,
we'll do all we can.

771
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:15,869
Hey, let me ask you.

772
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:17,037
How do you guys cope...

773
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:19,172
with the ever-increasing
complexity of thought

774
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:21,477
that comes with maturity?

775
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:23,944
Brilliant!

776
00:43:23,946 --> 00:43:25,279
Oh!

777
00:43:25,281 --> 00:43:27,447
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

778
00:43:27,449 --> 00:43:28,849
Our future's
in bright hands.

779
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,183
Oh, no, no.
Don't chew that.

780
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:32,085
You don't know
what I've stepped in.

781
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,920
I can't seem
to get her attention.

782
00:43:33,922 --> 00:43:35,555
Or even say
the right thing.

783
00:43:35,557 --> 00:43:37,024
Well, you're in luck.

784
00:43:37,026 --> 00:43:39,126
I know nothing
about women.

785
00:43:39,128 --> 00:43:40,227
But I do know
that we have

786
00:43:40,229 --> 00:43:43,230
the most amazing way
of proposing.

787
00:43:43,232 --> 00:43:44,298
If we start now,

788
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,565
- we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?

789
00:43:45,567 --> 00:43:46,768
Best part,

790
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,302
it involves
a lot of reindeer.

791
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:50,437
Whoa.

792
00:43:50,439 --> 00:43:51,638
Hey,
back at home...

793
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,540
Halima still over
at Hudson's Hearth?

794
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:54,608
She is.

795
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,376
Really?
She married?

796
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:57,511
Mm-mm.

797
00:43:57,513 --> 00:44:00,682
Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?

798
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:02,384
What else do you miss?

799
00:44:03,218 --> 00:44:04,786
My father.

800
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:06,822
He passed
long before all this.

801
00:44:07,956 --> 00:44:10,624
He was a great man.

802
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:12,159
Built us a good life
in Arendelle.

803
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:15,128
But taught me to never take
the good for granted.

804
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:17,497
He'd say, "Be prepared.

805
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:19,099
"Just when you think
you've found your way,

806
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:22,436
"life will throw you
onto a new path."

807
00:44:22,438 --> 00:44:24,538
What do you do
when it does?

808
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,972
Don't give up.

809
00:44:25,974 --> 00:44:29,543
Take it one step
at a time and...

810
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:32,346
Just do
the next right thing?

811
00:44:32,348 --> 00:44:33,815
Yeah.

812
00:44:33,817 --> 00:44:35,050
You got it.

813
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:41,290
I wanna show you
something. May I?

814
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,694
You know air, fire,
water, and earth.

815
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:48,028
Yes.

816
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,596
But, look,
there's a fifth spirit...

817
00:44:49,598 --> 00:44:53,300
said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature.

818
00:44:53,302 --> 00:44:54,601
A fifth spirit?

819
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:55,869
Some say

820
00:44:55,871 --> 00:44:58,638
they heard it call out
the day the Forest fell.

821
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,307
My father heard it.

822
00:45:00,309 --> 00:45:02,744
Do you think
that is who's calling me?

823
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:07,314
Maybe. Alas,
only Ahtohallan knows.

824
00:45:07,316 --> 00:45:09,017
Ahtohallan.

825
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:14,955
<i>♪ Dive down deep
into her sound</i>

826
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:19,426
<i>♪ But not too far
or you'll be drowned ♪</i>

827
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:21,328
Why do lullabies
always have to have

828
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:23,029
some terrible
warning in them?

829
00:45:23,031 --> 00:45:24,834
I wonder
that all the time.

830
00:45:27,503 --> 00:45:29,302
Earth Giants.

831
00:45:29,304 --> 00:45:31,206
What are they
doing down here?

832
00:45:32,141 --> 00:45:33,642
Shh!

833
00:45:34,176 --> 00:45:35,210
Hide.

834
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,288
They're coming!

835
00:45:54,731 --> 00:45:57,232
This is why
we don't play with fire.

836
00:45:58,367 --> 00:46:01,704
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?

837
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:31,164
Please tell me you were not
about to follow them.

838
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,400
What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?

839
00:46:33,402 --> 00:46:35,168
Or what if
they can crush you

840
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,404
before you even
get the chance?

841
00:46:37,406 --> 00:46:41,074
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice...

842
00:46:41,076 --> 00:46:44,077
find the truth,
and get us home.

843
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,313
Hey, guys.
That was close.

844
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:47,614
I know.

845
00:46:47,616 --> 00:46:50,116
The giants sensed me.
They may come back here.

846
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:52,619
I don't want to put anyone
at risk again.

847
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:53,955
And you're right, Anna.

848
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:55,923
We've got
to find the voice.

849
00:46:55,925 --> 00:46:57,123
We're going now.

850
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:58,658
Okay. We're going.

851
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,929
Let me just...

852
00:47:02,164 --> 00:47:04,732
Wait. Where are
Kristoff and Sven?

853
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:07,501
Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy

854
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:08,736
and a bunch of reindeer.

855
00:47:08,738 --> 00:47:10,036
- They left?
- Mm-hmm.

856
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,672
Just left
without saying anything?

857
00:47:12,674 --> 00:47:14,711
Who knows
the ways of men?

858
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:24,685
Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?

859
00:47:24,687 --> 00:47:26,121
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

860
00:47:26,823 --> 00:47:27,922
Everyone ready?

861
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:29,055
Ready!

862
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:30,257
Uh,
I could use a rehearsal.

863
00:47:30,259 --> 00:47:31,324
I love love.

864
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:33,260
Wait. You talk
for them, too?

865
00:47:33,262 --> 00:47:34,695
I do.

866
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:36,263
It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking.

867
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,733
Yeah. And then
you just say it.

868
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:40,168
And then you just say it.

869
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:44,941
Okay. Here she comes.

870
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:48,542
Princess Anna
of Arendelle...

871
00:47:48,544 --> 00:47:53,046
my feisty, fearless,
ginger-sweet love.

872
00:47:53,048 --> 00:47:55,584
Will you marry me?

873
00:47:56,686 --> 00:47:57,852
Um...

874
00:47:57,854 --> 00:47:59,152
No.

875
00:47:59,154 --> 00:48:01,187
The princess left
with the queen.

876
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:03,189
What? Wait,
what? What?

877
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:06,593
I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone.

878
00:48:06,595 --> 00:48:07,995
Long gone?

879
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:10,499
So, yeah.

880
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:14,267
Um, we're heading west
to the Lichen Meadows.

881
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,905
You can come with us
if you want.

882
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,945
Hey. Um...
I'm really sorry that...

883
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:26,546
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah. Yep.

884
00:48:26,548 --> 00:48:29,917
Okay, I better go pack.
You coming with?

885
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:31,551
I'll just... Yeah,
I'll meet you there.

886
00:48:31,553 --> 00:48:33,754
Okay, uh, you know
where you're going, right?

887
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:35,121
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yep.

888
00:48:35,123 --> 00:48:36,491

Hey, Olaf, um,
maybe just one of you should do it.

938
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:32,962
I agree.
She's a little pitchy.

939
00:52:34,197 --> 00:52:35,965
Hey, Gale's back.

940
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:42,905
What?

941
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:53,781
How can it be?

942
00:52:53,783 --> 00:52:54,817
What is it?

943
00:52:55,785 --> 00:52:57,818
Mother
and Father's ship.

944
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,788
But this isn't
the Southern Sea.

945
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,959
No, it isn't.

946
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:17,672
Why is their ship here?

947
00:53:18,774 --> 00:53:20,442
How is it here?

948
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:24,377
It must have been washed in
from the Dark Sea.

949
00:53:24,379 --> 00:53:26,749
What were they doing
in the Dark Sea?

950
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:30,416
I don't know.

951
00:53:30,418 --> 00:53:33,120
How did the ship
get through the mist?

952
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:34,991
I thought nobody could but us.

953
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:38,593
Unless nobody was on it.

954
00:53:39,594 --> 00:53:41,661
There's gotta be
something here.

955
00:53:41,663 --> 00:53:44,430
Wait. Wait.
Look around.

956
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:47,134
Every Arendellian ship
has a compartment.

957
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:48,503
Waterproof.

958
00:53:48,971 --> 00:53:50,838
That's very clever.

959
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,206
Although,
it does make me wonder

960
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:54,542
why they don't just make
the whole ship waterproof.

961
00:54:00,983 --> 00:54:02,118
Here.

962
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:10,291
What language is this?

963
00:54:10,293 --> 00:54:11,658
I don't know.

964
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:14,295
But look,
this is Mother's handwriting.

965
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:15,796
"The end of the ice age.

966
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:17,965
"The river found, but lost.

967
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:21,837
"Magic's source.
Elsa's source?"

968
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:25,942
It's a map.

969
00:54:27,944 --> 00:54:29,542
They traveled north

970
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:33,446
and planned to cross
the Dark Sea to...

971
00:54:33,448 --> 00:54:35,448
Ahtohallan.

972
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,151
It's real?

973
00:54:37,153 --> 00:54:38,385
Octa-who-what?

974
00:54:38,387 --> 00:54:39,920
Ahtohallan.

975
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:41,654
It's a magical river

976
00:54:41,656 --> 00:54:44,158
said to hold all the
answers about the past.

977
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,128
Reinforcing my "water
has memory" theory. Mm.

978
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:49,832
Water has memory.

979
00:54:56,372 --> 00:54:58,471
Elsa?

980
00:54:58,473 --> 00:55:01,043
I wanna know
what happened to them.

981
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:10,851
<i>Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic.</i>

982
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:12,720
<i>We keep going
for Elsa.</i>

983
00:55:12,722 --> 00:55:13,988
<i>The waves are too high!</i>

984
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:16,192
- <i>Iduna!</i>
- <i>Agnarr!</i>

985
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:21,163
Elsa!

986
00:55:29,372 --> 00:55:31,438
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

987
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,140
This is my fault.

988
00:55:33,142 --> 00:55:35,743
They were looking
for answers about me.

989
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:39,079
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

990
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:41,083
No. Just their deaths.

991
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:43,083
Stop. No.

992
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:45,819
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

993
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:48,521
reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

994
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:51,992
Because our mother
saved our father.

995
00:55:51,994 --> 00:55:54,028
She saved her enemy.

996
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,332
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

997
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:00,034
You are a gift.

998
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:01,301
For what?

999
00:56:01,303 --> 00:56:03,603
If anyone can resolve
the past...

1000
00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:06,940
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,

1001
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:08,475
it's you.

1002
00:56:08,477 --> 00:56:12,782
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

1003
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:22,156
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

1004
00:56:22,158 --> 00:56:25,492
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

1005
00:56:25,494 --> 00:56:26,894
A fifth spirit?

1006
00:56:26,896 --> 00:56:29,963
That's who's been calling
me from Ahtohallan.

1007
00:56:29,965 --> 00:56:33,069
The answers about the
past are all there.

1008
00:56:33,803 --> 00:56:35,171
So we go to Ahtohallan.

1009
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:37,840
Not "we."

1010
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:40,007
- Me.
- What?

1011
00:56:40,009 --> 00:56:42,476
The Dark Sea is too
dangerous for us both.

1012
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:45,345
No. No!
We do this together.

1013
00:56:45,347 --> 00:56:46,713
Remember the song?

1014
00:56:46,715 --> 00:56:48,916
"Go too far and
you'll be drowned."

1015
00:56:48,918 --> 00:56:51,285
Who will stop you
from going too far?

1016
00:56:51,287 --> 00:56:52,519
You said you believed in me,

1017
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,054
that this is
what I was born to do.

1018
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:57,324
And I don't wanna
stop you from that.

1019
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,426
I... I don't
wanna stop you

1020
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:01,295
from being whatever
you need to be.

1021
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:03,897
I just don't want
you dying...

1022
00:57:03,899 --> 00:57:08,168
trying to be everything
for everyone else, too.

1023
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,436
Don't do this alone.

1024
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:12,339
Let me help you, please.

1025
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:14,143
I can't lose you, Elsa.

1026
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,815
I can't lose you
either, Anna.

1027
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:23,052
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1028
00:57:24,553 --> 00:57:25,853
Wait, what?

1029
00:57:25,855 --> 00:57:27,521
What are you doing?

1030
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:28,791
Elsa!

1031
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,327
No! No!

1032
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:34,728
Olaf, help me stop.

1033
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,265
Give me a hand.

1034
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:41,335
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

1035
00:57:41,337 --> 00:57:43,003
Wait. Wait!
No! No! No!

1036
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,805
Oh, come on!

1037
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:46,974
Anna,
this might sound crazy...

1038
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:49,510
but I'm sensing
some rising anger.

1039
00:57:49,512 --> 00:57:51,979
Well, I am angry, Olaf!

1040
00:57:51,981 --> 00:57:54,748
She promised me
we'd do this together!

1041
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,283
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1042
00:57:56,285 --> 00:58:00,354
But what I mean is,
I'm sensing rising anger in me.

1043
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:02,389
Wait, you're angry?

1044
00:58:02,391 --> 00:58:04,525
Um, I... I think so.

1045
00:58:04,527 --> 00:58:06,493
Elsa pushed me away,
too,

1046
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:09,163
and didn't even
say goodbye.

1047
00:58:09,165 --> 00:58:12,665
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

1048
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:15,269
And you said some things
never change.

1049
00:58:15,271 --> 00:58:16,637
But since then,

1050
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:19,808
everything's done nothing
but change.

1051
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:21,808
I know.

1052
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:25,345
But look, I'm still here
holding your hand.

1053
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:28,549
Yeah,
that's a good point, Anna.

1054
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:30,751
I feel better.
You're such a good listener.

1055
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:33,520
Don't shush me. That's rude.

1056
00:58:33,522 --> 00:58:35,591
No! No!

1057
00:58:45,201 --> 00:58:47,668
Oh. The Giants.

1058
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:49,605
They're huge.

1059
00:59:05,754 --> 00:59:07,356
- Hang on, Olaf.
- Huh?

1060
00:59:12,661 --> 00:59:14,430
Try not
to scream.

1061
00:59:28,077 --> 00:59:29,078
Found it.

1062
00:59:30,646 --> 00:59:32,279
Thank you.

1063
00:59:32,281 --> 00:59:34,448
Where are we?

1064
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,817
In a pit
with no way out.

1065
00:59:36,819 --> 00:59:40,356
But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in.

1066
00:59:46,462 --> 00:59:48,128
Come on,
it'll be fun.

1067
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,963
Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,

1068
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:51,064
no one ever finds us...

1069
00:59:51,066 --> 00:59:53,267
and you starve
and I give up.

1070
00:59:53,269 --> 00:59:55,869
But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing

1071
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,474
a whole lot
better than we are.

1072
01:00:36,145 --> 01:00:37,179
Okay.

1073
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:49,091
Oh.

1074
01:00:58,834 --> 01:01:00,035
Whoa!

1075
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:28,864
No!

1076
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:47,449
Whoa!

1077
01:02:11,507 --> 01:02:12,508
No!

1078
01:02:39,435 --> 01:02:41,268
Of course.

1079
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:45,441
Glaciers are
rivers of ice.

1080
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:48,977
Ahtohallan is frozen.

1081
01:02:54,316 --> 01:02:55,949
I hear you.

1082
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:57,486

1142
01:07:19,048 --> 01:07:21,281

with the face of a monkey!

1147
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,824
I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

1148
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:31,391
But I'm great actually.

1149
01:07:31,393 --> 01:07:33,763
Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

1150
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:35,996
I love you.

1151
01:07:35,998 --> 01:07:37,698
I need to tell you
about my past.

1152
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,766
And where I'm from.

1153
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,167
I'm listening.

1154
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,203
Iduna!

1155
01:07:42,205 --> 01:07:43,904
What are you reading,
Your Majesty?

1156
01:07:43,906 --> 01:07:45,273
Oh, some new
Danish author.

1157
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:55,281
King Runeard,
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1158
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:56,449
Grandfather?

1159
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:58,618
We bring Arendelle's
full guard.

1160
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,522
But they have given us no
reason not to trust them.

1161
01:08:02,524 --> 01:08:04,290
The Northuldra
follow magic.

1162
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:06,227
Which means we can
never trust them.

1163
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:07,728
Grandfather?

1164
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:10,563
Magic makes people feel too powerful.
Too entitled.

1165
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:15,002
It makes them think they
can defy the will of a king.

1166
01:08:15,004 --> 01:08:16,971
That is not
what magic does.

1167
01:08:16,973 --> 01:08:18,571
That's just your fear.

1168
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:20,810
Fear is what
can't be trusted.

1169
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:30,350
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1170
01:08:30,352 --> 01:08:31,988
so they will
have to turn to me.

1171

1173
01:08:43,232 --> 01:08:45,465
They will come
in celebration.

1174
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:48,971
And then, we will know
their size and strength.

1175
01:08:50,639 --> 01:08:54,074
As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you...

1176
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:56,545
our neighbors, our friends.

1177
01:09:14,462 --> 01:09:17,264
King Runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters.

1178
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,999
It's hurting the Forest.

1179
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:20,400
It's cutting off
the North...

1180
01:09:20,402 --> 01:09:22,236
Let... Let's not
discuss this here.

1181
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,306
Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea.

1182
01:09:25,308 --> 01:09:27,009
Find a solution.

1183
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,421
No!

1184
01:09:45,862 --> 01:09:47,063
Anna!

1185
01:09:56,172 --> 01:10:00,875
Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?

1186
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:03,476
<i>You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,</i>

1187
01:10:03,478 --> 01:10:04,845
<i>so they will

1188
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:06,479
<i>King Runeard, the dam,</i>

1189
01:10:06,481 --> 01:10:08,251
<i>it's hurting the Forest.</i>

1190
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:15,022
Elsa's found it.

1191
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:16,422
What is it?

1192
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:18,426
The truth about the past.

1193
01:10:19,394 --> 01:10:21,561
That's my grandfather...

1194
01:10:21,563 --> 01:10:25,099
attacking
the Northuldra leader...

1195
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:27,703
who wields no weapon.

1196
01:10:30,339 --> 01:10:32,875
The dam wasn't
a gift of peace.

1197
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:35,608
It was a trick.

1198
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,344
But that goes
against everything

1199
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:38,781
Arendelle stands for.

1200
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:40,883
It does, doesn't it?

1201
01:10:43,652 --> 01:10:46,086
I know how to free
the Forest.

1202
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:50,490
I know what we have to do
to set things right.

1203
01:10:50,492 --> 01:10:52,695
Why do you say that
so sadly?

1204
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:55,329
We have to break the dam.

1205
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:57,865
But Arendelle
will be flooded.

1206
01:10:57,867 --> 01:11:00,768
That's why everyone
was forced out.

1207
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,873
To protect them
from what has to be done.

1208
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:06,042
Oh. Oh!

1209
01:11:09,178 --> 01:11:10,744
Are you okay?

1210
01:11:10,746 --> 01:11:13,115
I could really use
a bright side, Olaf.

1211
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:15,950
Bright side? Um...

1212
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:18,686
Turtles can breathe
through their butts.

1213
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:22,024
- Huh?
- And I see a way out.

1214
01:11:23,525 --> 01:11:25,593
I knew I could
count on you.

1215
01:11:29,932 --> 01:11:33,499
Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now.

1216
01:11:33,501 --> 01:11:34,870
We can meet her and...

1217
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,040
Olaf?

1218
01:11:38,975 --> 01:11:40,109
What's this?

1219
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:42,109
Are you okay?

1220
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:44,178
I'm flurrying?

1221
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,312
Wait. No. That's...

1222
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:47,016
That's not it.

1223
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:52,086
I'm flurrying away.

1224
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:55,422
The magic in me is fading.

1225
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:56,624
What?

1226
01:11:58,593 --> 01:12:00,694
I don't think Elsa's okay.

1227
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:03,065
I think...

1228
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,268
she may have gone too far.

1229
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:10,037
No. No.

1230
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:11,107
Anna?

1231
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:13,674
I'm sorry.

1232
01:12:13,676 --> 01:12:17,077
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

1233
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:18,578
- Okay?
- Wait.

1234
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,314
Come here.

1235
01:12:20,316 --> 01:12:22,617
- I've got you.
- Oh.

1236
01:12:23,085 --> 01:12:24,586
That's good.

1237
01:12:26,288 --> 01:12:28,122
Hey, Anna?

1238
01:12:28,124 --> 01:12:31,291
I just thought of one thing
that's permanent.

1239
01:12:31,293 --> 01:12:32,627
What's that?

1240
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:34,864
Love.

1241
01:12:36,098 --> 01:12:37,266
Warm hugs?

1242
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,906
I like warm hugs.

1292
01:17:42,338 --> 01:17:44,540
Wake up!

1293
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,126
That's it.

1294
01:18:06,128 --> 01:18:08,330
Come and get me!
Come on!

1295
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:15,604
Over here!

1296
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:20,742
That's right.
Keep coming.

1297
01:18:20,744 --> 01:18:22,277
Keep coming!

1298
01:18:28,852 --> 01:18:30,018
That'll work.

1299
01:18:30,486 --> 01:18:31,887
This way, guys!

1300
01:18:42,531 --> 01:18:44,431
What?

1301
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,002
No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam.

1302
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:58,345
Kristoff!

1303
01:18:58,347 --> 01:18:59,980
I'm here.
What do you need?

1304
01:18:59,982 --> 01:19:01,515
- To get to the dam.
- You got it.

1305
01:19:01,517 --> 01:19:02,518
Thank you.

1306
01:19:18,667 --> 01:19:20,400
Come on. Come on.

1307
01:19:20,402 --> 01:19:22,371
- Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!

1308
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,008
Lieutenant Mattias.

1309
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:30,577
Your Highness,
what are you doing?

1310
01:19:30,579 --> 01:19:31,978
The dam must fall.

1311
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,581
It's the only way to break
the mist and free the Forest.

1312
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:37,350
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs.

1313
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:40,822
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

1314
01:19:40,824 --> 01:19:42,958
King Runeard
betrayed everyone.

1315
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:45,525
How do you know that?

1316
01:19:45,527 --> 01:19:48,197
My sister gave her life
for the truth.

1317
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:52,098
Please.

1318
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,136
Before we lose
anyone else.

1319
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:17,459
Look out!

1320
01:20:24,834 --> 01:20:26,934
Destroy the dam!
Come on!

1321
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:28,470
Throw your boulders.

1322
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:34,777
That's it.

1323
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:53,997
- I've got her!
- Anna!

1324
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:55,832
Hang on!

1325
01:23:15,203 --> 01:23:17,805
I'm sorry
I left you behind.

1326
01:23:17,807 --> 01:23:20,775
I was just so desperate
to protect her.

1327
01:23:20,777 --> 01:23:23,911
I know. I know.
It's okay.

1328
01:23:23,913 --> 01:23:25,580
My love is not fragile.

1329
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:28,550
Wow.

1330
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:31,486
Look at the sky.

1331
01:23:33,355 --> 01:23:36,023
I just didn't realize
there was so much of it.

1332
01:23:36,025 --> 01:23:38,059
34 years...

1333
01:23:38,061 --> 01:23:39,626
Five months...

1334
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:42,330
And 23 days.

1335
01:24:53,136 --> 01:24:55,002
Is it really you?

1336
01:24:55,004 --> 01:24:56,939
Anna.

1337
01:24:58,808 --> 01:25:00,875
I thought I'd lost you.

1338
01:25:00,877 --> 01:25:02,275
Lost me?

1339
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:05,045
You saved me. Again.

1340
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:06,180
I did?

1341
01:25:06,182 --> 01:25:09,018
And, Anna,
Arendelle did not fall.

1342
01:25:11,053 --> 01:25:12,452
It didn't?

1343
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:14,722
The spirits all agreed.

1344
01:25:14,724 --> 01:25:17,727
Arendelle deserves
to stand with you.

1345
01:25:19,195 --> 01:25:20,326
Me?

1346
01:25:20,328 --> 01:25:23,396
You did what was right.
For everyone.

1347
01:25:23,398 --> 01:25:25,467
Did you find
the fifth spirit?

1348
01:25:27,435 --> 01:25:30,039
You are
the fifth spirit.

1349
01:25:30,706 --> 01:25:31,906
You're the bridge.

1350
01:25:31,908 --> 01:25:34,641
Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides.

1351
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:37,945
And Mother had
two daughters.

1352
01:25:37,947 --> 01:25:40,147
We did this together.

1353
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:42,852
And we'll continue
to do this together.

1354
01:25:43,786 --> 01:25:44,919
Together.

1355
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:46,889
Elsa! You're okay!

1356
01:25:50,492 --> 01:25:52,226
You look different.

1357
01:25:52,228 --> 01:25:53,426
Did you cut your hair
or something?

1358
01:25:53,428 --> 01:25:56,265
- Or something.
- Oh.

1359
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:03,204
Anna, I need to ask you
a question.

1360
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:05,039
Okay.

1361
01:26:05,041 --> 01:26:07,342
Do you want to build
a snowman?

1362
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:08,945
What?

1363
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:25,061
Thank goodness
water has memory.

1364
01:26:37,073 --> 01:26:38,404
Anna.

1365
01:26:38,406 --> 01:26:40,774
Elsa!

1366
01:26:40,776 --> 01:26:43,344
Kristoff! And Sven!

1367
01:26:43,346 --> 01:26:46,280
You all came back.

1368
01:26:46,282 --> 01:26:49,582
Oh, I love happy endings.

1369
01:26:49,584 --> 01:26:51,018
I mean, I presume we're done.

1370
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:53,687
Or is this "putting us
in mortal danger" situation

1371
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:55,388
gonna be a regular thing?

1372
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:57,291
No. We're done.

1373
01:26:57,293 --> 01:27:00,428
Actually,
there is one more thing.

1374
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:02,462
Anna,

1375
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:05,101
you are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known.

1376
01:27:06,302 --> 01:27:09,270
I love you with all I am.

1377
01:27:09,272 --> 01:27:10,871
Will you marry me?

1378
01:27:10,873 --> 01:27:12,438
Oh.

1379
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,442
- Yes!
- Ah.

1380
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:24,720
Aw.

1381
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:40,968
Arendelle's okay.

1382
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,437
What?

1383
01:27:43,172 --> 01:27:45,005
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

1384
01:27:45,007 --> 01:27:46,340
Oh!

1385
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:47,710
Hello.

1386
01:27:48,543 --> 01:27:52,112
You know,
you belong up here.

1387
01:27:52,114 --> 01:27:55,483
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle.

1388
01:27:56,385 --> 01:27:59,987
Luckily,
I know just what that is.

1389
01:27:59,989 --> 01:28:02,790
While I still don't know what
"transformation" means...

1390
01:28:02,792 --> 01:28:07,129
I feel like this Forest
has really changed us all.

1391
01:28:11,867 --> 01:28:17,340
Presenting Her Majesty,
Queen Anna of Arendelle!

1392
01:28:23,446 --> 01:28:26,080
Oh! Hello.
Hi.

1393
01:28:26,082 --> 01:28:28,951
Sven, don't you look nice.

1394
01:28:30,219 --> 01:28:32,319
Oh, my goodness! Olaf!

1395
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:34,321
Charmed, I'm sure.

1396
01:28:34,323 --> 01:28:36,290
Charming.

1397
01:28:36,292 --> 01:28:37,760
Your Majesty.

1398
01:28:39,128 --> 01:28:41,061
Kristoff.

1399
01:28:41,063 --> 01:28:43,864
Aw, did you boys
get all dressed up for me?

1400
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:46,066
It was Sven's idea.

1401
01:28:46,068 --> 01:28:49,236
One hour. You get this
for one hour.

1402
01:28:49,238 --> 01:28:50,938
That's okay.

1403
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,908
I prefer you
in leather anyway.

1404
01:28:56,312 --> 01:28:58,879
I'm shocked you can last
an hour. That was brutal.

1405
01:28:58,881 --> 01:29:02,383
The things we do for love.

1406
01:29:02,385 --> 01:29:04,184
What is this crazy magic
called again?

1407
01:29:04,186 --> 01:29:05,585
A photograph.

1408
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:07,587
Photograph. Huh.

1409
01:29:07,589 --> 01:29:08,722
We look good.

1410
01:29:08,724 --> 01:29:10,791
Halima. General Mattias.

1411
01:29:10,793 --> 01:29:12,893
Uh, Your Majesty.
I'll be right back.

1412
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:15,561
You can look at our photograph
while I'm gone.

1413
01:29:15,563 --> 01:29:17,630
I'm just kidding.

1414
01:29:17,632 --> 01:29:19,802
- How am I doing?
- Fantastic.

1415
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:32,782
Our lands and people,
now connected by love.

1416
01:29:38,821 --> 01:29:41,688
Hi, Gale.
You like it?

1417
01:29:41,690 --> 01:29:45,061
Oh, do you mind?
I've got a message for my sister.

1418
01:30:04,346 --> 01:30:06,348
Thank you.

1419
01:30:08,117 --> 01:30:10,984
"Charades Friday night.
Don't be late.

1420
01:30:10,986 --> 01:30:13,619
"And don't worry,
Arendelle's doing just fine.

1421
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:15,621
"Keep looking
after the Forest.

1422
01:30:15,623 --> 01:30:17,558
"I love you."

01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,693
I love you, too, sis.

1424
