00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,265
<i>Sorry, I just can't give
you that kind of information.</i>

3
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:29,934
<i>I'll do anything else.
I just can't do that.</i>

4
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:33,138
<i>I can't betray my country. I won't.</i>

5
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,045
<i>This country gave me everything.</i>

6
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:38,812
<i>Oh, God. Just keep him away from me.</i>

7
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:41,353
<i>Please. Don't let him near me.</i>

8
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:43,684
<i>Oh, no! Oh, God!</i>

9
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,259
<i>Come on, baby. Just relax into
it. Let Godzilla do his thing.</i>

10
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,257
Come on. This is wrong on so
many levels. You in or not?

11
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,559
And get cheated again?

12
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:56,697
What? No, the Pooch may lie, the
Pooch may steal, the Pooch may...

13
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:00,568
- Refer to himself in the third person?
- Occasionally. But the Pooch won't cheat.

14
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:03,337
Well, the Pooch can relax.
I was worried about Cougar.

15
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:05,571
Yeah, right. It's always the quiet ones.

16
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:09,478
What? It's Blind Man's
Bluff. High card wins.

17
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:11,312
How in the hell can a man cheat you?

18
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:13,615
Cards.

19
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:19,788
Feel like I got something
here. I got something.

20
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:22,396
Queen, king, jack. Queen,
king, jack. All right.

21
00:01:22,564 --> 00:01:24,498
One, two, three, go.

22
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:38,577
I got a great, great
feeling about this one.

23
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:44,582
- Your mama had a great feeling last night.
- Oh, that was a mama joke.

24
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,554
What? All right.

25
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:50,089
- All right, let's go.
- Okay, it's a game.

26
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,625
All right, I will raise you.

27
00:01:54,396 --> 00:01:55,954
- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh, no?

28
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,395
- Got this piece off that Honduran general?
- Yes.

29
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:02,527
Guess what? I'm definitely in.

30
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:06,540
- Let's go.
- All right.

31
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,732
Whoa!

32
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:11,345
- Should even me up.
- How many do you have?

33
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:12,707
What is going on here?

34
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:14,280
Coug, it's your bet.

35
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:15,881
Hey, losers!

36
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:19,211
It's time.

37
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:37,396
We got a drug and arms
dealer named Fadhil...

38
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:41,441
...running a homegrown terrorist assembly
line out by the Madre de Dios River basin.

39
00:02:42,144 --> 00:02:46,079
We find it, we paint it for a
laser-targeted bomb, we get the hell out.

40
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,510
No muss, no fuss.

41
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,347
For that, they need us?

42
00:02:49,518 --> 00:02:52,180
You'd rather take on 50 dudes with AK's?

43
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:09,633
All right, I got eyes
on Monsieur Fadhil.

44
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,705
- Paint it.
- Showtime, fellas.

45
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:14,775
Go ahead and call me Michelangelo.

46
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,506
Dropkick, this is Pinball.
Request fire mission.

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,377
The target is lased, and you are clear
to make a run from north to south. Over.

48
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:25,449
Roger, Pinball, target
acquired and locked.

49
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,148
Be advised, ETA fireworks,
zero eight Mikes.

50
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,154
Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,862
Boss?

52
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:45,136
They're using kids as mules.

53
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,969
- Call it in.
- We have children at target site.

54
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:53,205
Repeat, we have eyes on children
at target site. Please advise.

55
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:54,848
<i>Acknowledged. Maintain position.</i>

56
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,247
Maintain position? What
is he talking about?

57
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,944
We strongly recommend
cancellation of payload delivery.

58
00:04:00,422 --> 00:04:02,753
<i>Your orders stand. Prep for extraction.</i>

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,984
Cougar.

60
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,225
Dropkick, this is Pinball.

61
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,731
Equipment has suffered
catastrophic system failure.

62
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,266
Am calling an on-site abort.

63
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,870
<i>Well, that was just stupid.</i>

64
00:04:19,874 --> 00:04:21,274
Is this Mission Controller?

65
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:23,034
<i>This is Max, Colonel Clay.</i>

66
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:26,972
No one uses names on comms. This
is a secure military channel.

67
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,241
<i>- Really?
- Goddamn it, listen to me.</i>

68
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:31,147
There are children on site.

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,151
<i>And you think I didn't know that?</i>

70
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,023
<i>We locked coordinates
the moment you painted.</i>

71
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,852
<i>Delivery will occur on schedule.</i>

72
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,559
<i>- Have a super day.
- You can't...</i>

73
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:42,821
Shit! Jensen, contact the
plane directly. Call an abort.

74
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:45,865
I'm trying. He's jamming
us. There's nothing I can do.

75
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:49,967
There's something we can do.

76
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:52,402
All right, here it is.
Five against the fortress.

77
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:56,601
We got maybe, what, eight minutes before
an airstrike sets the world on fire.

78
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,406
Plenty of time.

79
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,706
I'll drive.

80
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,101
Us against 50 dudes with AK's, huh?

81
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,350
Jensen, Pooch, get a truck for
the kids. Rest, out in five.

82
00:05:41,523 --> 00:05:46,017
- Airstrike in four and change, ladies!
- Be out in four. Rally point. On me.

83
00:05:47,295 --> 00:05:48,387
Three minutes to target.

84
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,976
Come on, let's go! Out
you go. Come on, kids.

85
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:10,317
- Okay, you go over here with him.
- Come on, mama. Come on.

86
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,653
I got this. Get them out.

87
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:17,258
All right, who's your papi? Let's go
this way. Let's go. Come on, let's go.

88
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,361
Ah.

89
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:24,263
- No.
- Yeah.

90
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:25,559
- Really?
- Why not?

91
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:27,166
- Can you?
- Of course.

92
00:06:27,335 --> 00:06:28,893
Okay.

93
00:06:35,343 --> 00:06:36,776
Ladies.

94
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:42,180
Up you get. Up you get.

95
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,710
<i>Clay, we got the kids.
Rally point, two minutes.</i>

96
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:53,825
Max sent you, didn't he?

97
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,423
I won't commit to his
plan, he does this.

98
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:03,469
I'm gonna make this real easy for
you. You let him go, I let you live.

99
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,371
Come here, son. Come
here, son. Walk to me.

100
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,743
Attaboy.

101
00:07:11,913 --> 00:07:14,881
<i>Clay, get the hell
out. We gotta go, now.</i>

102
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,517
He'll kill you too, you know.

103
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:26,094
<i>Target is locked. T minus 20 seconds.</i>

104
00:07:27,963 --> 00:07:29,760
Oh, you stop for coffee in there?

105
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,636
What kind of blast radius we looking at?

106
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:43,572
Okay, Pooch, I need you to make
this bus go a little faster.

107
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,009
- Everybody, hold on to something.
- Like right now!

108
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:15,473
I got it, I got it!

109
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:16,838
There we go, Pooch!

110
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:23,378
Whew.

111
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:31,487
<i>Pinball, this is Chopper
3. Prepare for extraction.</i>

112
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:36,555
My favorite part was when
we were completely on fire.

113
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:38,926
But the shootout, that was good times.

114
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:44,838
There she blows.

115
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:46,397
Well done.

116
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,837
Let's go, let's go.

117
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:50,842
- All right, everyone together.
- Come on, let's go.

118
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:52,445
There you go. Good job.

119
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,711
Sir, there's not enough
room for your team and them.

120
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,278
Then it's them.

121
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:02,255
- Let's go, guys.
- All right, here we go.

122
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:05,418
Watch your heads.

123
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:17,038
You keep your bear.
You keep him safe. Okay?

124
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:21,102
Adios. Get them out of here.

125
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:38,821
Those are some cute little buggers.
Hope they make it to the court martial.

126
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,988
What is that? You hear that?

127
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,664
Guys, this is bad.

128
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,033
<i>Max, Cobra One, Bandit locked.</i>

129
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,366
<i>Understood.</i>

130
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:55,140
<i>Cobra One, kill Bandit.</i>

131
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:59,071
No!

132
00:10:45,794 --> 00:10:47,522
That's supposed to be us.

133
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:52,522
<i>Protests today in front of the
American Embassy, a violent response...</i>

134
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:55,864
<i>...to the deaths of 25 Bolivian
children killed during the operation.</i>

135
00:10:56,036 --> 00:10:58,163
Let me be perfectly clear.

136
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,573
In no way were these men acting
under orders from the U.S. government.

137
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,550
Is there gonna be some
kind of ceremony for them?

138
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:18,283
Where's the ring?

139
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,029
<i>I love you, Mommy. You're so pretty.</i>

140
00:12:04,638 --> 00:12:05,663
<i>I love you, Mommy.</i>

141
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:31,090
What are you doing? No, no, no!

142
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,730
- Jeez. He's gonna get murdered.
- Come on, come on, come on.

143
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:45,473
This is disgusting. All right,
I'm officially disgusted by us.

144
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:47,910
- And you lost again.
- We lost again.

145
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,483
- No, you put the bet down.
- You gave me the money.

146
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:53,747
Yeah, and that was
stupid of me, wasn't it?

147
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:59,355
I mean, could this get any more sleazy?

148
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:06,126
I suppose if we started drinking.

149
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:07,893
You're not...? You're not drinking?

150
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,539
Come on, get him in there!

151
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:26,177
Thank you.

152
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:34,986
I found a guy online who says he
can trade intel on Max for cash.

153
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:38,064
- All we gotta do is make a little money.
- We don't have money.

154
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:42,533
We're gonna go PayPal-ing some kid
in a basement who's most likely lying?

155
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,968
You were there. You know
the man tried to kill us.

156
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,540
The man did kill us, Clay.

157
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:53,046
No, we gotta stay focused.
All right? On the mission.

158
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:58,345
Get money, get clean passports, get back
to stateside without anybody noticing.

159
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,182
- Didn't even see what he looks like.
- We heard his voice.

160
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:03,654
A man with a voice is
a man with a throat.

161
00:14:03,825 --> 00:14:05,759
Come on. Clay, just look around you.

162
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:10,159
Do you think we're in a position to
actually take on some CIA super spook?

163
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,730
- Roque.
- It's a hell of a plan.

164
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,892
You know what? Pooch can set
up over there by the taco stand.

165
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:17,833
Jensen can set up communications
right there by the hookers.

166
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,803
- Captain.
- Yo! Yo.

167
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:22,875
You're not a soldier anymore.

168
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,945
You're not a soldier. All right?

169
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:31,016
Clay, for chrissakes,
you're losing the men.

170
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:37,189
- The men are fine.
- Yeah, well, you're losing me. All right?

171
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:41,424
He won, we lost. Just get us home.

172
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,460
Can you do that?

173
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:56,467
How's your steak?

174
00:15:57,405 --> 00:15:58,804
Meaty.

175
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:04,306
You want a bite?

176
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:08,314
Maybe later.

177
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:12,482
Okay.

178
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,820
Do I know you?

179
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:26,291
Relax, Papi.

180
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,835
Do I not look relaxed?

181
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:34,498
No.

182
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,814
Think we can change that?

183
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:51,852
Wow, it's everything
a girl can dream of.

184
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,888
Do you have a bathroom?

185
00:16:57,064 --> 00:17:00,000
No, I specifically requested the
only hotel room in the world...

186
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,635
...that doesn't have a bathroom.

187
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:05,263
Are you trying to turn a yes into a no?

188
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,033
Oh. Thank you.

189
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,116
So, what brings you to Bolivia?

190
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:21,245
Cruise ship.

191
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,686
We're a landlocked country.

192
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:26,122
Well, it's an amazing cruise ship.

193
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,799
Where were we now?

194
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:39,065
Well, I think you were
about to tell me...

195
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:41,468
...how you enjoy following me.

196
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,405
You saw me, didn't you?

197
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:45,670
I did.

198
00:17:47,248 --> 00:17:49,738
I bet you didn't see
me on Mercado Street.

199
00:17:55,188 --> 00:17:57,247
I have a business
proposition for you, Clay.

200
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:59,757
Oops. What happened to your accent?

201
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:01,987
Oops.

202
00:18:07,301 --> 00:18:08,461
I don't wanna hurt you.

203
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:11,161
- You're not going to.
- Oh, yes, I am.

204
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,632
- Hi.
- Hi.

205
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,458
What do you want?

206
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,455
I can help you find Max.

207
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,765
I'm listening.

208
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:02,615
How did you know we were alive?

209
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:05,251
I counted the number of
teeth in the chopper wreckage.

210
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,688
Plus you guys aren't exactly subtle.

211
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:13,152
Here's the deal. I get you and
your men back in the States.

212
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,192
In exchange, you get Max for me.

213
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:18,560
- What's the catch, lady?
- It's pretty much a suicide mission.

214
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,429
Why should I trust you?

215
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,799
Because if I were lying, I wouldn't
have used the words "suicide mission."

216
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:33,544
Just meet me here tomorrow.

217
00:20:34,582 --> 00:20:36,606
And bring your boys.

218
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:38,809
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

219
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,817
If you're lying to me, I'll kill you.

220
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:48,556
It was nice meeting you too.

221
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:50,955
Yes, it was.

222
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,451
I'm sorry we're late. There
was a party at the doll factory.

223
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,081
It was Pepito's birthday.

224
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:16,881
- Really?
- Yeah.

225
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:25,530
So she wanted to meet in a cemetery.

226
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,362
Because that's not,
like, foreboding at all.

227
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:31,303
- Am I the only one that sees this shirt?
- No.

228
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:34,140
Oh, it's my niece's soccer team.

229
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:37,800
Eight and under. I checked
their scores online and I...

230
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:40,046
What?

231
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,878
They're in the playoffs.

232
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:45,312
What do you have on her?

233
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,710
Besides a pant-busting crush?

234
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,285
Her company file is blank.

235
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:55,088
CIA has a standing kill order
on her. As does Hamas, Sinn Fיin.

236
00:21:55,296 --> 00:21:58,788
Pretty much everyone with the exception
of PETA wants this chick amscrayed.

237
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:03,960
You thinking clear on this? Because every
time you mess up, it's because of a woman.

238
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:05,696
- Name one time that I...
- Amber.

239
00:22:05,906 --> 00:22:09,398
- Amber's husband was the problem.
- Her husband wasn't the one who shot you.

240
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:11,169
- Only in the leg.
- What about Emma?

241
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:15,111
- Doesn't count. I didn't sleep with Emma.
- Because she put a bomb in your car!

242
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:18,809
I admit, that did take a little of
the romance out of the relationship.

243
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:22,319
Yeah. And now this chick shows
up and... What's her name, Aisha?

244
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,982
And well, she burns down our hotel.

245
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,422
I'm clear, Roque.

246
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:30,860
Well, you better be, because I
ain't getting killed by no girl.

247
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,762
It's been a long time since
anyone called me a girl.

248
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,432
She put a bomb in your car?

249
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:41,733
She was volatile.

250
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,779
Aisha, this is Jensen,
Pooch, Roque, Cougar.

251
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:48,708
Really? Heh.

252
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:56,181
Gentlemen, in 97 hours,
Max will be in Miami.

253
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:59,519
He travels in an armored column
with at least 30 private security...

254
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:01,355
...armed to the teeth.

255
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:04,157
You have a better shot at
kidnapping the president.

256
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,768
Good news for you is I have the power
to get you guys back in the U. S...

257
00:23:09,937 --> 00:23:12,666
...and fund the entire
op as you see fit.

258
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,831
You get Max and we're square.

259
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:17,944
And why should we believe you?

260
00:23:19,213 --> 00:23:22,705
Because I'm the first person you've
met who even admits he exists.

261
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:27,311
Listen, you guys can all
stay here in Bolivia and rot.

262
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,457
Or you can go home and get
revenge on the man that framed you.

263
00:23:30,957 --> 00:23:32,482
It's your choice.

264
00:23:33,327 --> 00:23:34,624
Colonel?

265
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,591
Don't call me that. We're
not soldiers anymore.

266
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:39,562
Okay, you know that if we do this...

267
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,897
...we are waging a war against
the Central Intelligence Agency.

268
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:46,201
They started it.

269
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,982
Okay, here's what I'm hearing.

270
00:23:57,151 --> 00:24:01,611
I'm hearing, "No." I'm hearing,
"Leave." I'm hearing, "I'm sorry."

271
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,418
- Is that what I'm hearing?
- We cannot do what you ask. I'm sorry!

272
00:24:05,593 --> 00:24:09,085
Tell me, Nabil, is this a moral
issue or a financial issue?

273
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,355
- A moral issue.
- Really?

274
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,129
You morally object to this deal?

275
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,134
- Yes, I'm sorry. Please, leave.
- Okay, so that is what I'm hearing.

276
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:20,296
Now I want you to listen
to me, listen carefully...

277
00:24:20,473 --> 00:24:22,134
...because I want you to hear this.

278
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,872
Wade?

279
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:30,344
What is this? What are you doing?

280
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:32,916
No, please!

281
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:45,894
What the hell was that?

282
00:24:46,366 --> 00:24:47,891
You gave me the nod.

283
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:51,299
A hit-him-in-the-face nod, not
a throw-him-off-the-roof nod.

284
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,735
- I thought that's what you wanted.
- At most...

285
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:58,037
...at most, that was
a break-his-fingers nod.

286
00:24:58,212 --> 00:25:01,613
Jesus, Wade. The man
was a scientific genius.

287
00:25:01,816 --> 00:25:05,946
Granted, his weight signaled
certain impulse-control issues...

288
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:10,680
...but that's no reason to
throw his fat ass off 57 floors.

289
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:12,517
Sorry.

290
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:20,058
I think I speak for everyone here
when I say your actions were excessive.

291
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:23,726
And yes, more than
just a little wasteful.

292
00:25:26,674 --> 00:25:29,507
But then, it does seem to
have had the desired effect.

293
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:32,840
- I'll tell you what, throw baldy off next.
- No, please. Wait.

294
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,916
We have a different moral
perspective than our late colleague.

295
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,818
I need one to test and four to use.

296
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:41,544
Four snukes?

297
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:43,355
We would need much money.

298
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:49,127
You will have much money.

299
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,468
Welcome back to the land of the living.

300
00:26:37,678 --> 00:26:39,077
How do you wanna begin?

301
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,170
We're gonna go bird hunting.

302
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:34,493
It's a sonic de-materializer.
Better known as a snuke.

303
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:37,833
For the 21st-century green terrorist.

304
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,670
Pure destruction.

305
00:27:40,374 --> 00:27:42,035
No pollution.

306
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,577
So who are we selling them to?

307
00:27:49,516 --> 00:27:51,950
Chinese extremists, PLF,
the frigging French Basques.

308
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,145
As long as they have the right
price and are willing to use it.

309
00:27:55,322 --> 00:27:57,483
No stockpiling, no deterrence.

310
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,718
It's like giving a handgun
to a 6-year-old, Wade.

311
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:02,555
You don't know how it's gonna end...

312
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:05,597
...but you're pretty sure
it's gonna make the papers.

313
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,324
Another war.

314
00:28:07,534 --> 00:28:10,001
Well, what do you believe in, Wade?

315
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,162
I'm guessing shotguns and big titties.

316
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,672
I also enjoy air shows and beer.

317
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:21,209
We're saving the country...

318
00:28:21,382 --> 00:28:24,476
...doing something for the benefit
of the United States of America.

319
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:26,619
I was born in Quebec.

320
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:30,454
Okay. Then we're saving North America.

321
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,591
Oops. Sorry.

322
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,626
Let me have your weapon, Wade.

323
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,636
Base 1, this is Cavalier 415!

324
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,745
We've been in a collision
with a civilian vehicle.

325
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:28,245
Carvey's dead and
Freeman's hurt real bad.

326
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:30,645
We need medevac immediately.

327
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,877
He's got kids, Base 1, he's got kids!

328
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:36,352
That sucked.

329
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:39,458
<i>- Roger, Cavalier 415.
- Come on, Jensen. You're better than that.</i>

330
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:42,356
<i>- Scrambling a chopper. Hang in there.
- He's got kids.</i>

331
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:43,928
So contrived.

332
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,065
I used to be good at that. Right, Roque?

333
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:47,631
- Shut up.
- Thanks, man.

334
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:49,966
Robert De Niro who?

335
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,637
- Jensen, shut up.
- You shut up, Roque.

336
00:29:52,806 --> 00:29:56,003
You're dead. I'm spinal injury.
Spinal injury can talk. Dead can't.

337
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,235
Stop talking or I'll
break your neck really.

338
00:29:58,412 --> 00:30:00,777
You really gotta start
getting into character.

339
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:03,644
I'm serious, man. Dead guy, no talking.

340
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:07,078
All right.

341
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:13,583
Base 1, this is Medvac Delta.
We have visual on Cavalier 415.

342
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,323
Here we go.

343
00:30:25,672 --> 00:30:27,663
Buddy, we'll get you
patched up in no time.

344
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,139
Oh, my God. Hi.

345
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,675
What's your name?

346
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:34,375
<i>Fire when ready, Cougar.</i>

347
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:37,148
Ow.

348
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:42,179
- Oh, shit.
- What the hell's going on?

349
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,929
Woo-hoo.

350
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:56,267
You've just been
chopper-jacked, fellas.

351
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:06,174
Where's my wild goose?

352
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:08,314
The GPS?

353
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,849
Got it!

354
00:31:15,355 --> 00:31:17,516
Have you ever seen
an EMT look like this?

355
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:19,716
Really, bro? "Hi, what's your name?

356
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,724
I have no legs, but I
wanna take you on a date"?

357
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:25,996
Yo, J.

358
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,001
What do you think is up with all
this "Don't call me colonel" stuff?

359
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,069
It's classic loss of identity.

360
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:34,900
Clay defined himself by his
place in military structure...

361
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:37,066
...his way of measuring the good he did.

362
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:41,203
Without it, he's just another
loser like the rest of us.

363
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:44,182
You know cats can make a
thousand different sounds...

364
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,841
...and dogs can only make ten?

365
00:31:47,254 --> 00:31:51,816
Cats. Not to be trusted.

366
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:54,153
Okay, do me a favor
and never repeat that.

367
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,989
Okay? We're all set.

368
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:02,730
Ready to take a giant step for...

369
00:32:02,903 --> 00:32:05,235
...guys who like to
steal stuff, I guess.

370
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:07,970
- Hit it.
- Showtime.

371
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:13,643
Beautiful.

372
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:16,940
- Now, that's a rocket!
- Let them chase that.

373
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,173
That is a rocket!

374
00:32:18,352 --> 00:32:19,614
- Wow, shit!
- Did you see that?

375
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:21,344
<i>Medevac Delta, this is Base 1.</i>

376
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:24,251
- Oh, my God.
- I'm the black MacGyver. BlaGyver.

377
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:26,790
<i>- What's your situation? Over.
- Time to move.</i>

378
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,718
Hi.

379
00:33:07,234 --> 00:33:09,065
Where you from originally?

380
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:12,368
The wilds of Northern Africa.

381
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:15,171
Wow, so that must've been...

382
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:22,845
...sandy.

383
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:28,915
Do you have any hobbies?

384
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:32,788
When I was little, I
collected human ears.

385
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:35,793
Good times.

386
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:39,357
But it's...

387
00:33:51,211 --> 00:33:53,371
No, no, no, my friend, listen.

388
00:33:53,547 --> 00:33:56,414
A gas turbine generator running
a force-fed rectifier unit.

389
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:59,676
Hook it up to the fuel tank
and... we're in the game.

390
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:03,516
There are few things in life that liberal
application of duct tape can't solve.

391
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:06,220
Are small arms gonna be a problem?

392
00:34:06,593 --> 00:34:08,788
It's taken care of. Thanks.

393
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:12,755
Which brings me to my question, Aisha.

394
00:34:12,933 --> 00:34:15,094
- What do you want with Max?
- Roque.

395
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:17,259
No. She did her part.

396
00:34:17,637 --> 00:34:19,104
All right?

397
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:22,264
We got home. I mean,
we could walk right now.

398
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:24,637
- You can, but we made a deal.
- Fuck deals, okay?

399
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,005
You made a deal with Clay.

400
00:34:28,448 --> 00:34:29,881
I want answers.

401
00:34:35,988 --> 00:34:39,390
Max is trying to buy
next-generation weapons.

402
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,821
I don't know the endgame.

403
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:45,224
What I do know is when Max takes an
interest in something, people die...

404
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,798
...and world maps get redrawn.

405
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:50,334
Bullshit. Do you really think you
could take him on, little girl?

406
00:34:50,504 --> 00:34:53,268
No, big boy. You are.

407
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,000
I think I'm just gonna
kill her right now, Clay.

408
00:34:56,176 --> 00:34:58,667
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

409
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:02,576
I'm right here. You wanna shoot
your bankroll, go right ahead.

410
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:05,845
Roque.

411
00:35:07,154 --> 00:35:08,451
Roque.

412
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,392
Okay, you stay with us, but if
anything smells like a trap...

413
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:19,555
...I get to put a bullet in
your skull. Does that sound fair?

414
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,291
That sounds fun.

415
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,302
Sounds like my parents.

416
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:29,000
- I knew you weren't gonna shoot her.
- Not today.

417
00:35:35,749 --> 00:35:37,683
Southwest perimeter secure.

418
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,714
Load and go.

419
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:48,487
That's the prize. That's where Max is.

420
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:52,723
Yeah, I sure hope he doesn't see us
in this bright yellow banana Pinto.

421
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:56,367
Trying to say that you're embarrassed
to be seen in an American classic?

422
00:35:56,536 --> 00:35:58,163
This is an American classic?

423
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:01,237
All right.

424
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:02,872
Here we go.

425
00:36:03,043 --> 00:36:05,010
Let's see what you got.

426
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:11,784
Good shot.

427
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,480
Clay, where are the seatbelts, bro?

428
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:18,283
We don't need seatbelts. The
G-forces will hold you in your seat.

429
00:36:20,527 --> 00:36:21,618
<i>Jensen, are we wired?</i>

430
00:36:22,362 --> 00:36:23,386
Max is westbound.

431
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:28,430
And these hot dogs are delicious.

432
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:37,441
- This is not a sweet car, dog.
- This is a classic.

433
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:40,375
Yeah, this is a classic piece of shit.

434
00:37:17,183 --> 00:37:19,447
Come on, back up! Move that car!

435
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,280
Lead vehicle hit. Give me the exits.

436
00:37:21,454 --> 00:37:23,615
<i>Northbound and southbound are blocked.</i>

437
00:37:23,789 --> 00:37:24,882
<i>We're trying to clear now.</i>

438
00:37:25,058 --> 00:37:26,548
Dismount.

439
00:37:28,128 --> 00:37:30,595
Form a defensive perimeter
around the package.

440
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:43,772
This will wake them up.

441
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:47,838
Masks on!

442
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,530
Oh, shit.

443
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,995
Pooch?

444
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:16,306
Open fire! Shoot it down now!

445
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:18,975
All right, here we go.

446
00:38:34,294 --> 00:38:36,125
Goddamn.

447
00:38:37,831 --> 00:38:39,992
We are under attack. We need backup.

448
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:48,533
All right, easy. Go to your right now.

449
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:52,309
All right, ease down,
ease down, to your left.

450
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,378
No, no, your other left. Easy, easy.

451
00:38:54,547 --> 00:38:55,980
- Can you let me do this?
- Sure.

452
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:57,207
Can you let me do this?

453
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:04,685
That's right, bitches. I got a crossbow.

454
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,760
<i>Backdoor is sealed. Take him up.</i>

455
00:39:22,742 --> 00:39:24,209
Get out of my way!

456
00:39:35,054 --> 00:39:36,488
Whoa!

457
00:39:38,925 --> 00:39:43,054
- You said small arms weren't a problem.
- Does that look like small arms to you, huh?

458
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:46,460
- He has a cannon down there.
- Doughnut. Doughnut, doughnut, doughnut!

459
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:54,165
Shit!

460
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,540
Sure you've done this before?

461
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:02,374
Okay, right now, not the
time. Not the time right now.

462
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:04,210
Pooch, what's your status?

463
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:08,753
Completely irritated and possibly
crashing, but fish is on the hook.

464
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:10,616
We got Max.

465
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,847
Barely.

466
00:40:28,141 --> 00:40:32,510
Fellas. You're not gonna believe
this shit. Wade was there.

467
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,941
Wade Travis, 7th Group?

468
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:35,205
He made me, Clay.

469
00:40:35,648 --> 00:40:36,945
No question.

470
00:40:37,117 --> 00:40:39,381
- Who's he? - Ran
counter-guerrilla ops with him.

471
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:42,077
Just say he's a bad man.

472
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:44,480
I thought you guys were bad men.

473
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:47,626
- He's worse.
- All right, but right now, we need to deal...

474
00:40:47,794 --> 00:40:50,820
...with the heavily armed
evil genius inside this truck.

475
00:40:50,997 --> 00:40:52,259
Come on.

476
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:53,922
You ready?

477
00:40:57,771 --> 00:40:59,363
Open the valve.

478
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,669
All right, let's unlock this thing.

479
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,148
Hit the ground!

480
00:41:11,918 --> 00:41:14,079
Hit the ground or I'll
blow your head off!

481
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:15,854
Yeah, I don't think so.

482
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:17,614
First and final warning.

483
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:20,790
Gasoline, muzzle flash, think about it.

484
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:25,795
Put them down.

485
00:41:33,006 --> 00:41:34,268
Coug.

486
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:37,806
- Where is he?
- Who?

487
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:39,809
Max.

488
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:42,238
Who the hell is Max?

489
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,010
- I can explain.
- Shut up.

490
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:49,745
Jensen, open it.

491
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,223
It's a hard drive...

492
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,893
...from Goliath, the multinational
manufacturer of everything.

493
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:07,800
I'm completely locked out.

494
00:42:07,974 --> 00:42:11,603
Without a decryption key, you're
looking at a really cool paperweight.

495
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,109
Shoot her. Burn everything.

496
00:42:22,555 --> 00:42:25,353
- Don't you wanna find out what's on it?
- No.

497
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:27,391
I can't find Max.

498
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:30,551
Nobody can.

499
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,030
But I knew that he was moving
something that was very valuable to him.

500
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:36,463
Clay!

501
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:41,136
Whatever it is, we can use
it against him. It's leverage!

502
00:42:41,307 --> 00:42:44,276
The drive is proprietary
technology built by Goliath.

503
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:47,004
The algorithm's probably
on the mainframe.

504
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:54,386
- Come on. We're not considering that.
- Wait, wait, wait.

505
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:57,887
Oh, no, come on, man. We're
not the good guys anymore.

506
00:42:58,057 --> 00:42:59,888
Twenty-five kids.

507
00:43:00,492 --> 00:43:03,393
Twenty-five innocent lives lost
because of this guy. Remember?

508
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:04,586
- I do.
- You were there.

509
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:06,163
Yeah, I was there.

510
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,061
- Max is gonna pay.
- Is this a guilt trip?

511
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:11,532
No, I don't want him to
pay. I want my life back.

512
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:15,606
Okay? My life back. Enough
of this revenge bullshit.

513
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:19,939
- I'm killing her right now.
- You don't like the way I'm running things...

514
00:43:20,346 --> 00:43:22,314
...you can find the door.

515
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:23,915
And go where, Clay?

516
00:43:24,083 --> 00:43:25,710
Huh? Go where?

517
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:29,583
We're fugitives. Because of you.

518
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:31,989
What the hell are you
gonna do next, huh?

519
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:35,093
Put us in a box, because you
got beat by a guy on a radio?

520
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,161
- Hey, whoa.
- Okay, all right, all right.

521
00:43:37,363 --> 00:43:39,694
- Cool out, cool out.
- You shouldn't have done that.

522
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:41,959
- I did do it.
- You shouldn't have done that.

523
00:43:42,168 --> 00:43:43,692
I'm gonna cut your head off, man.

524
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:45,868
Bring it!

525
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:47,834
- Hey, get off!
- Roque.

526
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:51,101
They know we're alive, Roque.

527
00:43:52,111 --> 00:43:55,205
Only thing we have to use against
them right now is that drive.

528
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:59,752
She framed us. Are you
guys blind? She framed us!

529
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:03,117
We hit Goliath Worldwide
headquarters in two days.

530
00:44:03,323 --> 00:44:06,780
You want your life back?
You're gonna have to steal it.

531
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:09,188
You're wrong, you know that, right?

532
00:44:09,362 --> 00:44:11,262
- Again because of a woman!
- Cut her loose.

533
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:13,665
Cut her loose.

534
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,498
Cut her loose, Roque.

535
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:17,392
You cut her loose, bro.

536
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:24,971
This is on you.

537
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:45,592
<i>We're all set, sir.</i>

538
00:44:45,765 --> 00:44:47,062
Commence.

539
00:44:47,233 --> 00:44:49,599
<i>- Code.
- Pulsar.</i>

540
00:44:52,038 --> 00:44:53,300
What's pulsar?

541
00:44:54,674 --> 00:44:56,665
What do you know about
deep space tachyons?

542
00:44:57,777 --> 00:44:58,903
Nothing.

543
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:02,977
- Base-particle string
theory? - Nothing.

544
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:04,877
Singularity events?

545
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:06,279
Not a ton.

546
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:10,248
I think we should move on, then.

547
00:45:17,997 --> 00:45:22,593
I'm gonna give you 45 seconds to
explain what happened to my drive.

548
00:45:28,106 --> 00:45:30,405
And who am I looking at here, Wade?

549
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:32,539
Clay and his unit.

550
00:45:32,745 --> 00:45:36,646
Clay and his unit? That
sounds like a porno, Wade.

551
00:45:36,816 --> 00:45:38,613
You had them killed four months ago.

552
00:45:38,785 --> 00:45:40,878
I've done a lot in four months, Wade.

553
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:42,316
I'm a very busy man.

554
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:44,080
The Bolivia situation?

555
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,314
Fadhil.

556
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:47,118
The Max intel Fadhil gathered...

557
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:50,087
Was incinerated along with
everything else in the blast.

558
00:45:50,296 --> 00:45:51,558
These guys survived.

559
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:53,461
And they have my drive.

560
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,332
Yeah.

561
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:59,202
Okay, so five dead
men hijacked you, Wade.

562
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:01,670
Did you happen to find
out who's behind them?

563
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:05,638
- Not the CIA, NSA, special ops.
- Yeah, I'm aware it's not us.

564
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:10,715
Seems like the only thing we do
know is who they're coming after.

565
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:19,248
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

566
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:22,890
- What's the plan?
- What's the plan?

567
00:46:23,062 --> 00:46:26,293
The plan is get me an
18-man fire team in 12 hours.

568
00:46:26,465 --> 00:46:29,026
- Okay.
- Are we clear on the plan?

569
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:31,397
Or we could do it a third time.

570
00:46:32,104 --> 00:46:33,697
- Clear.
- Good.

571
00:46:34,307 --> 00:46:37,037
Oh, Wade, you know what I was
thinking? I forgot earlier.

572
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,441
Get me an 18-man fire team in 12 hours.

573
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,547
Are we clear?

574
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,330
Do you want some?

575
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,207
Pooch has a wife.

576
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,483
Jensen has a niece.

577
00:47:53,886 --> 00:47:58,220
When all this is over and they go home
to their families, what are you gonna do?

578
00:48:00,526 --> 00:48:02,551
I'll think of something.

579
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,488
They'll never let you be a soldier
again. You know that, right?

580
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:15,702
- You have no one, do you?
- Do you?

581
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:20,973
I got Roque.

582
00:48:26,118 --> 00:48:27,517
You know...

583
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,680
...if you two really fought...

584
00:48:31,591 --> 00:48:32,750
...he would kill you.

585
00:48:36,094 --> 00:48:37,494
Why's that?

586
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:39,689
Because of the others.

587
00:48:41,434 --> 00:48:43,061
You care what happens to them.

588
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:45,870
And you think that's a weakness?

589
00:48:46,672 --> 00:48:48,139
I know it is.

590
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:50,640
It's the law of the jungle.

591
00:48:50,843 --> 00:48:52,935
Well, thankfully,
we're not in the jungle.

592
00:48:53,112 --> 00:48:54,636
Yes, we are.

593
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:32,107
Good morning.

594
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:36,111
Oh, wow.

595
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:39,486
That's just peachy.

596
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:40,785
All right, look.

597
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,225
We're not going anywhere until
you two squash this bullshit.

598
00:49:44,397 --> 00:49:46,388
- We are on a schedule here. Let's go.
- Yeah.

599
00:49:46,565 --> 00:49:49,159
Oh, we're on a schedule. Okay.

600
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:51,962
What are you doing?

601
00:49:58,508 --> 00:49:59,634
Roque...

602
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,170
...I'm sorry I hit you in the face.

603
00:50:05,948 --> 00:50:08,415
That was good. That was good. Roque?

604
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:10,549
Roque?

605
00:50:10,753 --> 00:50:14,018
Clay, I'm sorry I threatened
to cut your head off.

606
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,818
Very good. Wow.

607
00:50:17,593 --> 00:50:19,424
Don't you two feel so much better?

608
00:50:20,096 --> 00:50:21,120
- No.
- No.

609
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:23,697
I don't give a shit, because I do.

610
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:27,596
Now, I say we go watch Jensen
get himself killed. Yup?

Nasty business, really.
Best discussed in person.

630
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:53,655
All right. I'm on my way.

631
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:55,518
I'll see you there.

632
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:04,523
Thank you.

633
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,071
Hi.

634
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:15,938
I'm Skippy from Tech Support, here to
install the firewall on Anderson's system.

635
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:19,775
You just missed him. But if you want,
you can come back in, like, an hour?

636
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:22,474
I could be out in minutes.
He doesn't have to be there.

637
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:24,710
- You can't go in.
- Upstairs is riding me.

638
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:28,482
- But you can't... Sir...
- Thank you, I appreciate it. I like your dress.

639
00:52:30,693 --> 00:52:32,024
Dress?

640
00:52:33,061 --> 00:52:34,154
Too much.

641
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:38,198
Algorithm's on the mainframe.

642
00:52:43,471 --> 00:52:45,337
Downloading it now.

643
00:52:48,944 --> 00:52:51,913
- Skippy?
- Hey! Shit.

644
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,106
- Really?
- Oh, ho, wow.

645
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:58,013
Look, I know this
probably doesn't look...

646
00:53:05,494 --> 00:53:06,927
Clay, I need an exit!

647
00:53:07,095 --> 00:53:10,497
<i>Circle around the north side of
the building. You'll have cover.</i>

648
00:53:21,477 --> 00:53:22,944
Freeze!

649
00:53:23,379 --> 00:53:25,074
Wow, this got serious.

650
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:35,418
I'm warning you.

651
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:40,619
I am a lethal killing machine. It
was a secret government experiment.

652
00:53:40,796 --> 00:53:45,597
They did stuff to me. Spooky stuff.

653
00:53:47,302 --> 00:53:48,963
Anal stuff.

654
00:53:49,372 --> 00:53:52,341
Turned me into a dangerous telekinetic.

655
00:53:53,276 --> 00:53:55,972
As the ancient Tibetan
philosophy states:

656
00:53:56,512 --> 00:54:00,414
"Don't start none, won't be none."

657
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,890
Telekinetic your way out of this.

658
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:14,855
- Pow.
- Ah!

659
00:54:16,632 --> 00:54:18,156
- Poof.
- Argh!

660
00:54:22,939 --> 00:54:27,136
Face down, or I'll make your
heart stop beating with my mind.

661
00:54:32,782 --> 00:54:33,806
Thank you, Cougar.

662
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:45,450
- Who's got the hard drive?
- Yeah.

663
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:49,496
And uploading the algorithm.

664
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:52,864
And...

665
00:54:53,769 --> 00:54:57,364
Holy shit. Girlfriend
was right. Ha, ha, ha.

666
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,631
- It's a courier drive.
- A what?

667
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:02,710
Twenty-first-century bagman.
Russian mob banks pioneered them.

668
00:55:02,877 --> 00:55:05,210
- Like an electronic bearer bond.
- Okay, all right.

669
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:07,974
Say that again, but a lot
slower and dumber, please.

670
00:55:08,651 --> 00:55:10,915
Okay. Pretend you are super evil.

671
00:55:11,086 --> 00:55:14,055
And you want to move a ton of
your ill-gotten blood money...

672
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:17,351
...but you can't,
because it can be tracked.

673
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,459
So you load your cash
onto this bad boy...

674
00:55:19,628 --> 00:55:22,222
...and you can physically
move it anywhere you wanna go.

675
00:55:22,398 --> 00:55:24,696
And we have Max's courier drive, right?

676
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:27,900
We have Max's $400 million.

677
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:32,268
All right, Clay, before you go do
something noble like smashing it...

678
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:34,375
...I say we go on Amazon and get a jet.

679
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,840
It doesn't work that way.

680
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:39,539
Unfortunately courier drives can only
load and unload on their home systems.

681
00:55:39,749 --> 00:55:44,413
Although if we were gonna buy stuff,
I'd say a canary-yellow stretch Hummer.

682
00:55:44,587 --> 00:55:46,817
No, no. We're gonna
trade it back to him.

683
00:55:47,023 --> 00:55:49,116
He's gonna get his money
and clear our names.

684
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,656
- No, we made a deal.
- Yes.

685
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,088
Aisha.

686
00:55:53,295 --> 00:55:55,263
He's gotta kill us now. You know that.

687
00:55:56,665 --> 00:55:57,791
Yeah, I know that.

688
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:00,936
This has a record of every IP
address it's been jacked into.

689
00:56:01,103 --> 00:56:03,936
And there's one address
that comes up a lot.

690
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,199
Obviously someplace
this keeps going back to.

691
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:07,432
Max's base of ops.

692
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,244
Port of Los Angeles.

693
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:18,143
Thing probably has files on every
black-book op he's ever pulled.

694
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:20,246
Including Bolivia.

695
00:56:20,555 --> 00:56:22,751
We could hit him there,
we could clean it out...

696
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:25,291
...expose the world to what he's done.

697
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:26,928
Clear our names in the process.

698
00:56:27,696 --> 00:56:29,789
All right, it's a good plan.

699
00:56:31,434 --> 00:56:32,526
And we still kill him.

700
00:56:35,704 --> 00:56:36,762
Absolutely.

701
00:56:40,975 --> 00:56:44,377
We appreciate you meeting us
at a single-story facility.

702
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:45,911
No problem.

703
00:56:46,082 --> 00:56:48,380
I view that entire
incident as your standard...

704
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:50,985
..."getting to know each
other" business orientation.

705
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:52,279
I agree.

706
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,252
But now that we do know each other...

707
00:56:54,423 --> 00:56:58,860
...know that if you ever come near me with
that Yankee Doodle, tough-guy bullshit...

708
00:56:59,028 --> 00:57:01,553
...you will be fed to my dogs.

709
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:06,094
As you know, we had a hiccup
on our end with the money.

710
00:57:06,268 --> 00:57:09,101
One billion dollars.
This is the new price.

711
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:11,205
- One billion?
- Cash.

712
00:57:11,373 --> 00:57:13,034
Cash is gonna be difficult.

713
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:18,146
Difficult? Mr. Wade, life the way you
people want to live it is difficult.

714
00:57:18,314 --> 00:57:22,011
You want less difficult? Move
to my country. Study Hinduism.

715
00:57:22,184 --> 00:57:26,245
Meditate. Cultivate
serenity. Way less difficult.

716
00:57:26,421 --> 00:57:29,414
But you want to buy bombs.

717
00:57:30,659 --> 00:57:33,787
I'm afraid that's a more
difficult way of life.

718
00:57:34,796 --> 00:57:36,264
Mr. Wade.

719
00:58:06,228 --> 00:58:07,252
Hello.

720
00:58:08,164 --> 00:58:10,894
He wants one billion, in cash.

721
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:12,499
<i>That's a lot of paper routes.</i>

722
00:58:13,769 --> 00:58:15,167
Stay wet.

723
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:18,666
Did you get me my 18-man
firing team I asked for?

724
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,433
<i>- Yup.
- Okay.</i>

725
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:23,470
Change of plans. Kill them.

726
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:25,169
Kill my 18 guys?

727
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:27,747
Or fire them. Whichever is easiest.

728
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:30,078
Honestly, firing them.

729
00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:33,221
Okay. Did you give them
intel on Clay's people?

730
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:36,490
- Well, yeah.
- And we're back to killing them.

731
00:58:37,626 --> 00:58:41,118
Fine, I'll kill them.
What are we doing instead?

732
00:58:41,297 --> 00:58:43,492
What's the matter? You related to them?

733
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:45,131
Actually one of them, yeah.

734
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:47,262
Really? By blood?

735
00:58:47,468 --> 00:58:50,870
A brother-in-law. I said I'd
kill him. What are we doing?

736
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:55,673
It's not what we're gonna do.
It's what Clay's gonna do for us.

737
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:59,644
- And that is?
- Get us our billion, baby.

738
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,388
What are we up against?

739
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,324
Chryon.

740
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:21,058
Oh, shit.

741
00:59:21,502 --> 00:59:22,764
Who's Chryon?

742
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:25,805
Chryon Security Solutions.
Ex-Special Forces.

743
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:29,342
Basically a bunch of guys like Cougar
without the warm and cuddly side.

744
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:34,609
We start recon at 0600.

745
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,316
Anyone not here for it...

746
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,551
...I'll understand.

747
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,838
I was just going over the plan.

748
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,835
You wanna go over the plan?

749
01:00:04,647 --> 01:00:06,706
Let's go over the plan.

750
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,921
Ah, shit.

751
01:00:17,092 --> 01:00:18,423
You okay?

752
01:00:19,128 --> 01:00:21,357
Petunias are playing
the Marigolds on Sunday.

753
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:23,789
So?

754
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,291
These are the Marigolds.

755
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:27,992
Whoa.

756
01:00:28,237 --> 01:00:30,501
- Those are some hard-looking
8-year-olds. - I know.

757
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:33,039
Look at these inmates. Heh, heh.

758
01:00:33,708 --> 01:00:34,937
What are you doing?

759
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:41,712
I was just trying to connect Fadhil's
drug operation with Max's cash.

760
01:00:41,884 --> 01:00:44,717
There's about 4 million missing.
I'm trying to track it down.

761
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:49,618
- What are you doing, Pooch?
- Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.

762
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,419
What you need a satellite for?

763
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,362
Wait a second, is that today?

764
01:00:57,933 --> 01:00:59,901
Yeah.

765
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:02,093
Probably knows if it's
a boy or a girl now.

766
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:04,432
- Congratulations, man.
- Congratulations.

767
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:05,732
Thank you, man.

768
01:01:05,908 --> 01:01:08,274
Say that now, but you know Jolene.

769
01:01:08,443 --> 01:01:10,639
She finds out I'm alive,
she's gonna kill me.

770
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,549
I can't let her have
that baby without me.

771
01:01:21,857 --> 01:01:23,415
What? What?

772
01:01:24,026 --> 01:01:26,256
Pooch, we all know
we're gonna die in there.

773
01:01:29,365 --> 01:01:31,230
And we can do that without you.

774
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,162
No, you can't.

775
01:01:33,602 --> 01:01:35,001
Go home.

776
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:38,835
Got it.

777
01:01:39,174 --> 01:01:42,541
Fadhil's 4 million didn't disappear.
It just went into a private account.

778
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:44,041
Whose account?

779
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:45,612
It's a family trust.

780
01:01:45,948 --> 01:01:49,179
Says that in the event of
his death, goes to his kid.

781
01:01:49,385 --> 01:01:50,977
Name of...

782
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:53,912
- Shit.
- Wow.

783
01:01:55,491 --> 01:01:57,015
Tell me what happened in Bolivia.

784
01:02:02,297 --> 01:02:04,458
We thought we were on a legitimate op.

785
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:07,433
Paint a terrorist camp
so we could bomb it.

786
01:02:08,836 --> 01:02:12,568
Turns out we were just
executing some Max vendetta.

787
01:02:13,075 --> 01:02:15,100
So you knew nothing about Fadhil?

788
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:16,904
A target's a target.

789
01:02:18,514 --> 01:02:22,211
Never would have known the difference
if we hadn't seen those kids and gone in.

790
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:26,284
You went in?

791
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:28,584
Well, yeah. We had to.

792
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:32,557
It was 25 innocent kids in there, Aisha.

793
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:35,287
Did you see him?

794
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:38,060
Yeah.

795
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:40,931
Why do you wanna know all this?

796
01:02:41,236 --> 01:02:44,762
Did you kill Fadhil, Clay?

797
01:02:46,108 --> 01:02:47,803
Who are you?

798
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:52,208
She's Fadhil's daughter, Clay!

799
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:54,349
She's Fadhil's daughter!
Fadhil's daughter.

800
01:02:54,516 --> 01:02:56,074
Oh, shit.

801
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:01,945
She's got a gun and it's pointed at
my dick. Clay, it's pointed at my dick.

802
01:03:02,357 --> 01:03:03,984
Rather it was pointed at your face?

803
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:05,955
I know it makes no sense, but yes.

804
01:03:08,129 --> 01:03:09,290
Better?

805
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:10,489
Not really.

806
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:12,793
- Where's your gun, Jensen?
- In the van.

807
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:14,959
- What's it doing there?
- Not much.

808
01:03:15,137 --> 01:03:17,765
- Would you shut up?
- What if it was pointed at your dick?

809
01:03:53,408 --> 01:03:55,342
- Aah!
- J, where you hit?

810
01:03:55,511 --> 01:03:57,308
She shot me in my arm!

811
01:03:57,513 --> 01:03:59,447
You're gonna live. You're gonna live.

812
01:04:01,383 --> 01:04:02,907
Cougar, be gentle!

813
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:09,619
Clay.

814
01:04:10,158 --> 01:04:12,388
We gotta go, now.

815
01:04:14,596 --> 01:04:16,063
Come on.

816
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:25,568
Home again, home again, jiggety-jig.

817
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:35,947
- Do you have the money?
- Jesus.

818
01:04:36,118 --> 01:04:38,086
Always with the money.

819
01:04:38,754 --> 01:04:43,589
Hi, how are you? How've
you been? Namaste?

820
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:48,126
I recently attended the funeral of my
best friend who you had thrown off a roof.

821
01:04:48,297 --> 01:04:49,787
How have you been?

822
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,226
I can't complain.

823
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:56,269
Actually I'm thinking about getting
a satellite radio for my car.

824
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,630
God, you are short.

825
01:05:00,142 --> 01:05:01,871
Seriously, how much do you weigh?

826
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:04,102
Are you standing in a hole? What...?

827
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,471
We have your ordnances.

828
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:11,877
Alrighty. Let's make a cash withdrawal.

829
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:16,790
And who want to be a billionaire?

830
01:05:40,515 --> 01:05:42,038
She burned us.

831
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:46,282
The whole op's blown.

832
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:50,682
She knows our names, faces.

833
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:54,256
Does she know about our families?

834
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,398
Damn it, Clay, look at me.

835
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:02,966
Does she know about our families?

836
01:06:07,242 --> 01:06:08,300
Yes.

837
01:06:13,048 --> 01:06:14,913
I gotta go home, to Springfield.

838
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:19,445
Jensen can come with me. His
niece is in New Hampshire.

839
01:06:20,655 --> 01:06:22,180
I'm done.

840
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:31,124
Well, I'm going to the port, okay?

841
01:06:36,571 --> 01:06:38,903
You get back to your families.

842
01:06:40,142 --> 01:06:41,472
We'll get Max.

843
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:46,342
I did this. I made the call in
Bolivia. I put your families in danger.

844
01:06:46,547 --> 01:06:48,072
Just let me and Clay finish this.

845
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,343
So you two idiots are
gonna go in there blind?

846
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:57,349
Three.

847
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,857
Hey, getting shot's great.
I'm up for doing it again.

848
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:04,093
Four idiots.

849
01:07:10,872 --> 01:07:11,930
You sons of bitches.

850
01:07:18,146 --> 01:07:19,271
I'll drive.

851
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:20,847
Five.

852
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:55,946
We're in. Status?

853
01:07:56,451 --> 01:07:58,419
The Pooch is good.

854
01:07:59,755 --> 01:08:01,916
All right, Mojito. It's
just me and you, Papi.

855
01:08:03,057 --> 01:08:04,525
And this hot-ass van.

856
01:08:36,625 --> 01:08:38,149
Hey, you!

857
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:56,241
And disco.

858
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,513
- What's the password?
- Let us in or I'll kill you.

859
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,574
Correct.

860
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:06,953
Main server is two skylights
over. I'm coming out of that door.

861
01:09:07,122 --> 01:09:10,990
Be ready to move as soon as Cougar
hits the fire alarm. Get gone.

862
01:09:27,308 --> 01:09:30,904
I'm above the computer
room. Maybe 30 seconds out.

863
01:09:31,378 --> 01:09:32,744
Shit.

864
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:34,505
Wade's here.

865
01:09:35,851 --> 01:09:38,183
<i>Last chance to get
the hell out of Dodge.</i>

866
01:09:38,419 --> 01:09:39,444
Roger that.

867
01:09:43,291 --> 01:09:45,155
- Hey, Clay.
- Yeah?

868
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,418
Check this out.

869
01:09:50,165 --> 01:09:51,860
Go, Petunias.

870
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:58,304
And the crowd goes wild.

871
01:09:58,773 --> 01:10:00,536
Where do you think you're going?

872
01:10:00,842 --> 01:10:01,934
How you guys doing?

873
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,805
<i>Cougar, squelch when you're in position.</i>

874
01:10:03,979 --> 01:10:05,071
Squelch.

875
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:14,813
Cougs? Cougs?

876
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:16,855
Well, what do we have here?

877
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:18,951
What's up, fellas?

878
01:10:21,863 --> 01:10:23,990
I think someone's trying to set us up.

879
01:10:26,101 --> 01:10:27,295
Jesus.

880
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:30,502
Something's not right.

881
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,668
Oh, yeah?

882
01:10:49,557 --> 01:10:51,354
Hello, Clay.

883
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:56,058
Roque.

884
01:10:57,032 --> 01:10:58,693
Wade.

885
01:11:00,302 --> 01:11:01,769
Yeah.

886
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:07,203
After the Miami fiasco,
I cut a deal, Clay.

887
01:11:11,379 --> 01:11:12,539
You're a goddamn traitor.

888
01:11:12,714 --> 01:11:14,477
No, you betrayed us!

889
01:11:15,349 --> 01:11:19,286
You were gonna keep planning missions, ways
to find Max, until you got us all killed.

890
01:11:19,454 --> 01:11:22,287
- No.
- Yes! I tried to tell you. You wouldn't listen.

891
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:26,518
No, you wanted your revenge. The
face-to-face with the big bad wolf.

892
01:11:26,694 --> 01:11:29,357
The voice on the radio.
All that bullshit.

893
01:11:29,698 --> 01:11:31,097
Now I get to walk away.

894
01:11:31,299 --> 01:11:32,732
We all would've walked, Roque.

895
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:36,667
Don't you get it yet?

896
01:11:38,006 --> 01:11:39,768
There's no server.

897
01:11:42,143 --> 01:11:43,804
Max lured you here.

898
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,107
This is a CIA cash stash.

899
01:11:47,949 --> 01:11:53,046
Kill me now and maybe
you walk away from this.

900
01:11:53,388 --> 01:11:54,877
No, you die later.

901
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:57,524
You're about to steal a
billion dollars from the CIA.

902
01:12:00,628 --> 01:12:02,323
Congratulations, Roque.

903
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:06,730
You just helped these assholes get
everything they need to start a war.

904
01:12:09,904 --> 01:12:11,303
We cool?

905
01:12:16,244 --> 01:12:18,212
He's not my problem.

906
01:12:19,748 --> 01:12:21,113
Take him away.

907
01:12:22,484 --> 01:12:24,418
Let's get back to the boat.

908
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,153
Hold on. Hold on.

909
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:34,228
I followed you everywhere,
man. Everywhere.

910
01:12:35,296 --> 01:12:37,856
Just couldn't do that shit no more.

911
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,964
You're gonna die very badly.

912
01:12:43,938 --> 01:12:45,337
No.

913
01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:55,509
Come on, let's go.

914
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:06,049
Do you have any fours?

915
01:13:07,962 --> 01:13:08,986
Go fish?

916
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,097
You actually have two fours. Two.

917
01:13:15,303 --> 01:13:17,464
You don't understand this game, do you?

918
01:13:24,612 --> 01:13:27,240
Looks like somebody's money's here.

919
01:13:29,184 --> 01:13:30,617
By the way...

920
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:32,753
...your ordnances are right here.

921
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:34,081
Tricky Vikki.

922
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:39,383
Four snukes and a Ducati.

923
01:13:40,695 --> 01:13:42,060
As requested.

924
01:13:49,437 --> 01:13:50,461
So you're Max?

925
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:53,940
Welcome to the team.

926
01:13:59,247 --> 01:14:02,080
Supervise the loading of
the money onto our plane.

927
01:14:02,517 --> 01:14:03,575
What do you mean?

928
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:07,779
What do you mean?!

929
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:11,014
New change of plan.

930
01:14:29,811 --> 01:14:31,108
Roque.

931
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,603
Move.

932
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:36,476
Move it. Let's go.

933
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:45,152
- Get down on your knees.
- You heard him.

934
01:14:54,302 --> 01:14:55,326
No?

935
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:02,899
Pooch!

936
01:15:04,112 --> 01:15:07,047
- Son of a bitch!
- You know, I like that hat.

937
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:08,875
That's a great hat.

938
01:15:10,051 --> 01:15:11,746
Hey.

939
01:15:13,388 --> 01:15:15,618
I really don't care if
there's a hole in it.

940
01:15:21,228 --> 01:15:22,957
What are you smiling at?

941
01:15:28,303 --> 01:15:29,668
Now that's a bad-ass chick.

942
01:15:57,765 --> 01:15:58,959
Payback's a bitch.

943
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,935
Never touch the hat. Hm?

944
01:16:20,021 --> 01:16:21,648
Can you stand?

945
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:24,087
I've been shot in both of my legs.

946
01:16:24,259 --> 01:16:26,727
What kind of dumbass
question is that? Really?

947
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:28,520
So now we're Mr. Grumpy Pants.

948
01:16:28,696 --> 01:16:30,994
You're not the only one
who's been shot today.

949
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:34,025
Dude, you're standing.

950
01:16:35,336 --> 01:16:36,633
Back it up.

951
01:16:40,808 --> 01:16:44,437
I'm gonna need you to
arm this device right now.

952
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:48,177
Extremists are about to be framed
for cratering the great Port of L.A.

953
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:51,614
- You are insane.
- I am engineering a global terrorist conflict...

954
01:16:51,818 --> 01:16:55,846
...that's finally gonna restore
some order to this big blue marble.

955
01:16:57,291 --> 01:17:00,284
Now light the firecracker.

956
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:14,706
Cougs.

957
01:17:16,811 --> 01:17:17,835
Clay!

958
01:17:18,813 --> 01:17:20,212
Did you kill him?

959
01:17:23,284 --> 01:17:26,013
My father found out
about Max's real plans.

960
01:17:26,187 --> 01:17:28,417
He was gonna stop him.

961
01:17:29,223 --> 01:17:31,783
Did you kill him?

962
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:36,295
Yes.

963
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:42,361
- Aisha, he was a bad man.
- It doesn't matter!

964
01:17:43,037 --> 01:17:44,629
I know.

965
01:17:46,274 --> 01:17:48,606
You can kill me right now.

966
01:17:48,776 --> 01:17:51,540
Or you can let me help
you do what you need to do.

967
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:55,877
Either way, I get it.

968
01:18:08,296 --> 01:18:09,854
Let's go get Max.

969
01:18:13,333 --> 01:18:15,427
Wade said boat. That
means we're at the docks.

970
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:16,864
Pooch, can you stand?

971
01:18:18,506 --> 01:18:20,337
Oh. Oh, this is stupid question day.

972
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:23,033
This is stupid question day.
Nobody decided to tell me.

973
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:26,738
- No, that's cool. That's awesome.
- Come on, Legless Pooch. I got you.

974
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:29,775
- Here we go.
- All right, let's move.

975
01:18:30,485 --> 01:18:32,510
This isn't over yet.

976
01:18:57,912 --> 01:19:02,246
Come on, fellas. I hate to rush
you, but I got a plane to catch.

977
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,378
Come on!

978
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:29,803
There you go, there you go!
Get it in there, let's go!

979
01:19:31,979 --> 01:19:34,708
I got Roque. Rest of you get
Wade. Cougar, run point cover.

980
01:19:34,882 --> 01:19:37,043
Legless Pooch and I are
on it. Come on, buddy.

981
01:19:41,289 --> 01:19:44,588
Call me Legless Pooch again,
you're gonna be Headless Jensen.

982
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:48,620
I think it's a cool name.
Makes you sound like a pirate.

983
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:49,854
Your mama's a pirate.

984
01:19:58,506 --> 01:19:59,939
Go!

985
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:03,741
Cover me!

986
01:20:17,324 --> 01:20:19,589
- Get us in the air.
- We don't have room for lift.

987
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,490
Hey, do as you're told! Go
down there and turn around!

988
01:20:27,969 --> 01:20:29,493
- Shit!
- Damn it.

989
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:45,544
You know, I always wondered how
this was gonna play out, Clay.

990
01:20:45,719 --> 01:20:48,188
I told you already. You die very badly.

991
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:50,484
Oh, yeah?

992
01:20:51,225 --> 01:20:52,249
All right.

993
01:21:08,242 --> 01:21:10,107
Oh, my God.

994
01:21:13,915 --> 01:21:15,906
Jensen, run! Run!

995
01:21:28,896 --> 01:21:31,626
- Now I'm definitely gonna cut your head off.
- Go for it.

996
01:21:37,305 --> 01:21:39,739
Son of a bitch!

997
01:21:54,789 --> 01:21:55,914
You lose!

998
01:22:10,938 --> 01:22:13,099
We're clear to take
off. Get us out of here.

999
01:22:13,274 --> 01:22:14,298
Okay, all right.

1000
01:22:14,475 --> 01:22:15,840
- Get us out of here.
- Okay!

1001
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:19,312
The ordnance is live.

1002
01:22:19,913 --> 01:22:22,007
And this is the remote trigger.

1003
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:26,984
<i>Detonation in ten, nine...</i>

1004
01:22:33,561 --> 01:22:35,620
That son of a bitch
is stealing our cash!

1005
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:04,951
<i>Clay, Wade's on the move.</i>

1006
01:23:05,326 --> 01:23:06,588
<i>Clay!</i>

1007
01:23:06,994 --> 01:23:09,326
<i>You got Wade coming at you!</i>

1008
01:23:22,076 --> 01:23:23,338
- Run him over.
- What?

1009
01:23:23,510 --> 01:23:24,535
Run him over!

1010
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,262
Take him.

1011
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:18,257
Outstanding.

1012
01:24:27,942 --> 01:24:29,341
<i>Clay, we got a situation here.</i>

1013
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:33,207
<i>I'm looking at a giant, vibrating
Easter egg from hell and no Max.</i>

1014
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:34,472
I think I see him.

1015
01:24:34,648 --> 01:24:37,775
Initiate backup plan C.

1016
01:24:39,687 --> 01:24:41,484
The one where you rescue me.

1017
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:54,764
Shit.

1018
01:25:01,642 --> 01:25:03,542
ETA? I'm at rendezvous.

1019
01:25:07,013 --> 01:25:08,038
Hello?

1020
01:25:08,949 --> 01:25:10,041
Hello?

1021
01:25:11,285 --> 01:25:14,482
What's the matter? Crappy reception?

1022
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:27,163
- That was my ride.
- Bummer.

1023
01:25:27,935 --> 01:25:29,835
- Clay, is it?
- Colonel.

1024
01:25:30,004 --> 01:25:31,631
So you know what this is, then?

1025
01:25:31,839 --> 01:25:34,137
- Remote pressure trigger.
- Very good.

1026
01:25:34,575 --> 01:25:37,874
I release the button for ten
seconds and everything goes boom.

1027
01:25:39,647 --> 01:25:41,979
So since you can't shoot me...

1028
01:25:44,451 --> 01:25:45,884
Goddamn it!

1029
01:25:46,053 --> 01:25:47,520
You wanna try that again?

1030
01:25:49,223 --> 01:25:50,622
That hurt.

1031
01:25:53,294 --> 01:25:55,353
Having fun? Enjoying yourself?

1032
01:25:55,529 --> 01:25:57,258
Give me the trigger, I let you live.

1033
01:25:57,431 --> 01:25:59,797
You know the worst thing
about being the good guy?

1034
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,024
What's that?

1035
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,097
Having to make decisions like this.

1036
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,898
Hey! Ha, ha, ha. Look what Pooch found!

1037
01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:44,441
Look what I found.

1038
01:26:45,212 --> 01:26:46,736
This should do it.

1039
01:26:52,419 --> 01:26:53,443
Disarmed.

1040
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:57,484
Hello?

1041
01:27:01,662 --> 01:27:03,095
It's Max.

1042
01:27:08,569 --> 01:27:09,694
Hi, Max.

1043
01:27:09,870 --> 01:27:12,236
<i>Colonel. Nice catch.</i>

1044
01:27:12,406 --> 01:27:16,433
<i>We could've shared the dream together.
Now you're back to where you started.</i>

1045
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,839
Yeah, well, I wouldn't go that far.

1046
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:20,275
<i>Why's that?</i>

1047
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:22,938
Well, now I know what you look like.

1048
01:27:23,317 --> 01:27:25,751
Be seeing you soon, Max.

1049
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:38,955
It's a nice watch, homes.

1050
01:27:47,408 --> 01:27:48,932
Come with us.

1051
01:27:50,945 --> 01:27:54,744
When this is over and he's dead...

1052
01:27:56,016 --> 01:27:57,916
...you and I are gonna
finish that dance.

1053
01:27:59,386 --> 01:28:01,286
Fair enough.

1054
01:28:04,091 --> 01:28:06,650
Yo, let's go home.

1055
01:28:07,728 --> 01:28:09,025
She is volatile.

1056
01:28:19,273 --> 01:28:20,968
Poppa, Poppa, we are clear.

1057
01:28:21,775 --> 01:28:23,402
Setting perimeter.

1058
01:28:24,345 --> 01:28:25,812
You're five by.

1059
01:28:29,116 --> 01:28:31,482
I'm a little nervous
about this one, colonel.

1060
01:28:33,354 --> 01:28:36,289
Whatever happens, you
get to that package.

1061
01:28:43,797 --> 01:28:46,288
- Mission is live.
- Acknowledged.

1062
01:28:48,868 --> 01:28:50,336
I'm in.

1063
01:29:01,015 --> 01:29:04,917
Okay. The Pooch can do this.

1064
01:29:07,688 --> 01:29:10,213
The Pooch can do this.

1065
01:29:17,897 --> 01:29:19,263
Hey.

1066
01:29:19,433 --> 01:29:20,923
Sir, you can't come in here.

1067
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,398
It's okay.

1068
01:29:24,405 --> 01:29:25,565
I'm the father.

1069
01:29:26,073 --> 01:29:27,563
Where the hell have you been?

1070
01:29:29,243 --> 01:29:30,608
Traffic.

1071
01:29:33,113 --> 01:29:34,273
Traffic?

1072
01:29:42,756 --> 01:29:46,522
<i>It's a boy. It's a boy, Clay.</i>

1073
01:29:46,693 --> 01:29:49,161
<i>- And he looks just like me.
- Congrats.</i>

1074
01:29:52,066 --> 01:29:53,431
Cheers.

1075
01:30:18,892 --> 01:30:21,759
<i>- We're taking a big chance here.
- They're getting slaughtered.</i>

1076
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:33,662
Come on, ref! Watch number
nine! She's throwing elbows!

1077
01:30:33,874 --> 01:30:35,171
- Shh.
- Shh.

1078
01:30:36,610 --> 01:30:38,339
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1079
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:42,580
Hi. My niece, number 21.

1080
01:30:43,217 --> 01:30:44,479
She's the star of the team.

1081
01:30:47,221 --> 01:30:48,620
- Diaper change.
- What?

1082
01:30:50,891 --> 01:30:54,292
- Colonel, you wanna jump on this for me?
- I'd rather jump on a live grenade.

1083
01:30:54,495 --> 01:30:56,860
I'm invested. I have
100 dollars on this game.

1084
01:30:57,064 --> 01:30:59,498
Who'd you find to bet on
a girls' soccer game with?

1085
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:01,395
Yeah.

1086
01:31:01,568 --> 01:31:02,899
You bet against the Petunias?

1087
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:04,469
Well, he gave me points.

1088
01:31:04,671 --> 01:31:06,229
Big mistake.

1089
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:08,301
Let's go, girls. Let's go, girls!

1090
01:31:11,712 --> 01:31:13,043
Oh, no.

1091
01:31:16,717 --> 01:31:19,117
Hey, hey, hey! You
okay? Are you all right?

1092
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:23,779
- What is that? That is a foul! Are you blind?
- Get off the field, sir! Are you blind?

1093
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:25,652
Hey, boss, boss.

1094
01:31:26,293 --> 01:31:29,228
- Get off the field!
- You're not gonna blow your whistle?

1095
01:31:29,395 --> 01:31:30,556
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1096
01:31:31,197 --> 01:31:32,597
- Better...
- Yeah, we should.

1097
01:31:32,765 --> 01:31:35,098
- A girl kicked to the ground is not a foul?
- Get off!

1098
01:31:35,268 --> 01:31:38,534
I wanna know who you work
for! How high up does this go?

1099
01:31:38,739 --> 01:31:39,898
Get off the field!

1100
01:31:40,073 --> 01:31:42,234
This is worse than the NBA!

1101
01:31:42,442 --> 01:31:43,534
Okay, come on.

1102
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:45,740
Come on. Loser!

1103
01:31:45,913 --> 01:31:47,778
You don't deserve to wear those stripes!

1104
01:31:48,305 --> 01:32:48,930
