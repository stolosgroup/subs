I'm not sure how you...
you found me.

Perhaps you... you got my PO box
from an old agent or summit.

If so, that information
was never meant to be shared.

Nevertheless, it seems
from your letters, Mr. DuKent,

46

you know quite a bit about me.

47

you're aware of my sentiment

There's no gray area
to work with.

685

Now, if you had replaced
the word "spoken"

with "communicated,"...

687
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:24,734
then I wouldn't have known
what you know, you know?

688
00:51:25,937 --> 00:51:27,772
But you said "spoken,"

689
00:51:27,905 --> 00:51:29,506

During the Cold War,
there was these

703

short-wave radio broadcasts

704
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,962

00:52:25,897 --> 00:52:26,898
Usually, a woman's voice

706

spouting out numbers
and shit in German.

707
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:32,408
And to the general public,
it sounded like

708
00:52:32,502 --> 00:52:34,537
a bunch of nonsense,
when in actual fact,

709
00:52:34,604 --> 00:52:37,074
it was a complex cipher.

710
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,811
The beauty of this was,
instead of marking X on a window

711
00:52:40,878 --> 00:52:43,647
or hiding microfilm
in a hollow tooth,

712

had the audacity

to send their top-secret
