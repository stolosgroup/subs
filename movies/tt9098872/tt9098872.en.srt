2
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,166
We need sandbag...

3
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,958
to stop water coming in,
and we need a generator...

4
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:18,833
to pump water out.

5
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,208
And we need to do it quick.

6
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:25,000
If they've gone this way, no,
they die already.

7
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,208
They know what to do, yeah?

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,851
<i>The boys,
aged between 11 and 16 years old,</i>

9
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,791
<i>are all members of a Thai soccer team.</i>

10
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:59,041
<i>They became stranded in the dark tunnels
after a sudden and continuous downpour</i>

11
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,500
<i>blocked all exits.</i>

12
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,392
<i>This rain is gonna get worse and worse</i>

13
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,541
<i>and worse as the months go by,
four months of monsoon.</i>

14
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,416
<i>It will flood out that cave system,
so there will be no hope of getting out</i>

15
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,083
<i>if we don't get them out very soon.</i>

16
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,601
<i>Before they went into the cave complex,</i>

17
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,833
<i>they were planning to celebrate
a birthday party,</i>

18
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,541
<i>and that's what the boys were doing</i>

19
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,125
<i>when they found suddenly
it was raining heavily outside the cave</i>

20
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:03,166
<i>and the water level inside
started increasing.</i>

21
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,684
<i>I've been involved very heavily</i>

22
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,541
<i>with the exploration of the cave,</i>

23
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,666
that's how I became known as

24
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,625
you know, locally,
the crazy foreign caver.

25
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,791
Here's the junction.

26
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,875
<i>When I first started exploring
the Tham Luang system,</i>

27
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,541
<i>it was just
over six-and-a-half kilometers long.</i>

28
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:34,833
<i>Over the years,
we've extended it to ten kilometers.</i>

29
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:39,916
<i>And today it's the fourth longest
cave system in Thailand.</i>

30
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:43,458
<i>Tham Luang is made up
of three main passages.</i>

31
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:48,166
<i>One runs from the entrance to Sam Yaek,
known as the T-junction.</i>

32
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,500
<i>Water had come in
from the right-hand branch,</i>

33
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,250
<i>and it blocked their route out.</i>

34
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,833
<i>So, the boys weren't actually missing,
they were trapped.</i>

35
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,916
<i>The Navy SEALs, with, uh, respect,</i>

36
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,666
<i>you know, they're a strong
disciplined outfit,</i>

37
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:35,583
but cave diving needs specific skills
and specific types of equipment.

38
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,559
<i>We went to what we call the "war room."</i>

39
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:55,166
<i>I waited for Governor Narongsak.
And in my normal blunt way, said to him,</i>

40
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,583
"Sir, you have one chance at this rescue."

41
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:02,916
<i>I told him that we need
expert cave divers out here.</i>

42
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:08,166
He showed this note
to the Minister of Interior...

43
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,625
saying these are the best cave divers
in the world.

44
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,583
Get the smile on, Mr. Stanton.

45
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,875
- Yep. How many?
- Two please, and quite a thick one.

46
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:50,791
That's it, perfect. That's four quid.

47
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:04,541
<i>When I see a dark space in a cave,
it fascinates me.</i>

48
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,208
<i>It's like, I wonder what's there.</i>

49
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:13,791
<i>To most people, it's an alien environment.
It's dark, it could be claustrophobic.</i>

50
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,750
<i>To most people, that would be a disaster,</i>

51
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:22,583
but this is the strange world that
I enjoy. Caving, cave diving.

52
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,083
<i>You can look at a cave in two ways.
You could say,</i>

53
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,000
<i>I'm under hundreds of feet
and tons and tons of rock,</i>

54
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,458
<i>my life's in danger.</i>

55
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:37,125
Or you can say, my world
is this small passage, actually it's okay.

56
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,434
I think this is actually
just a cunning ploy...

57
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,559
<i>For people of my generation
in the cave diving world,</i>

58
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,583
Rick and John, you know,
they're sort of like

59
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,041
the figureheads, the idols to us.

60
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,017
<i>The first time I dived with Rick
was in this cave in New Zealand</i>

61
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,416
<i>called the Pearse Resurgence,</i>

62
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,958
<i>which is an extraordinarily
intimidating place.</i>

63
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,500
<i>It's really deep, it's freezing cold,
it's black, like, it soaks up your light.</i>

64
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,743
And I'd heard about the famous
Rick Stanton, of course.

65
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,541
But he turns up with this dry suit
that looks like it's 50 years old

66
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,958
and he's got this homemade harness
with a big lump of lead

67
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:14,083
between his shoulder blades
that are sort of sticky taped on.

68
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,833
<i>And he's got a homemade
side mount rebreather.</i>

69
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,208
<i>I mean, both those words are terrifying.</i>

70
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,666
<i>The side mount rebreather
was made from scratch</i>

71
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,875
<i>because there wasn't such
a thing available.</i>

72
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:33,125
<i>All the components were made by me
on a lath or a mill.</i>

73
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,541
<i>And so, Rick, using
this extraordinary bit of homemade kit...</i>

74
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,541
<i>jumped in the cave
and casually swims down to a new record.</i>

75
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,458
And we're all just going, "Far out,

76
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,791
there's no way
I'll ever be like that guy."

77
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:01,375
<i>John and I have been involved
in some very significant caving events,</i>

78
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,166
<i>which could take you right to the edge.</i>

79
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,250
And just going to those places...

80
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,791
you can't fail to have a bond.

81
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,125
<i>John's one of these people
that's done a lot of activities,</i>

82
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:20,041
<i>and does them
all with a huge degree of success.</i>

83
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,125
<i>First it was marathons,
then he got on to ultramarathons.</i>

84
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,291
<i>Very competent climber.
Really good kayaker.</i>

85
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,226
<i>Doing all of these dangerous things,</i>

86
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,000
has that made relationships
difficult for you?

87
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,458
Well, I wouldn't...

88
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:40,375
Just because an activity
is seen as dangerous

89
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:43,291
doesn't mean to say that you do it
in a dangerous manner.

90
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:46,666
But to answer your question,
probably yes.

91
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,958
I don't know how to explain this.

92
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,056
Did you fall in love?

93
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,333
Yes.

94
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,041
Amp called me and she said,
"Have you heard?

95
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:34,875
"There's a football team
trapped in a cave."

96
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,309
I was thinking
this has actually got our name

97
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,458
all over it.

98
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,875
We realized that we had a contact
on the ground,

99
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:56,375
<i>a British guy, Vern Unsworth.
He knew the cave very, very well.</i>

100
00:12:56,625 --> 00:13:02,041
Vern had got the critical note
to the Thai Minister of Tourism and Sport.

101
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,250
Vern rang and said,
"You're coming to Thailand

102
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,583
and you're on the half-past nine flight
that night."

103
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,041
They flew us out business class,

104
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,541
which was quite an experience.
I quite liked that.

105
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,875
<i>That was great,
because we are volunteers,</i>

106
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,958
<i>we don't get paid.</i>

107
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,833
<i>We arrived in Chiang Rai airport.</i>

108
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:26,708
<i>There was a big sign-up that said,
"Welcome to the World's Best Cave Divers."</i>

109
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,166
And we were marched out to this sign
and had to pose in front of it.

110
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,666
<i>All very embarrassing.</i>

111
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,541
<i>When we arrived at the cave site,
there was complete chaos.</i>

112
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,430
I've had a full career
in the fire service,

113
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:53,541
I've been to big incidents,
I've seen chaos, but not to this scale.

114
00:13:56,708 --> 00:14:01,041
<i>We were followed around by press cameras,
there were rescue people everywhere.</i>

115
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,500
Where's the people
that are supposed to be leading us?

116
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,458
<i>Somehow we managed to find Vern.</i>

117
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,666
<i>He said they'd seen the cave</i>

118
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,500
<i>progressively flood
in the last three days.</i>

119
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,833
<i>Just too much flow.
It was a difficult time.</i>

120
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,125
<i>Some people were thinking,</i>

121
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:22,041
<i>"Are their kids still alive?"
You know, "Where can they be?"</i>

122
00:14:22,916 --> 00:14:26,208
<i>We decided that we wanted to go in
and see as much as possible</i>

123
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,666
<i>before it flooded further.</i>

124
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,000
<i>As we walked in the entrance chamber,
which was a huge chamber,</i>

125
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:37,083
<i>there were electric lights blazing,
hoses, pumps and telephone wires.</i>

126
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,166
<i>Although the governor
was in charge of the incident,</i>

127
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:44,583
<i>he had devolved all responsibility
for the diving to the Navy SEALs,</i>

128
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,017
<i>and they were very clear
that they wouldn't let us go in the water.</i>

129
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,958
Our area of expertise is different.

130
00:14:50,041 --> 00:14:53,125
At that point,
it's really not safe to go in.

131
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,958
The UK team still insisted.
It got quite heated.

132
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,458
You understand
there are 13 children...

133
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,041
- I don't care, okay?
- In the cave?

134
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,333
The argument went all the way up top.

135
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,666
<i>He actually told the UK guy,</i>

136
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,083
"If you die in there,
don't expecting us to go fetch your body."

137
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:17,208
<i>If you are the Thai Navy SEALs,
and suddenly,</i>

138
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,416
two scruffy-looking,
middle-aged men turn up,

139
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,833
I can see how that really is a bad...

140
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,541
start to a relationship.

141
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,791
When we got out, it really was raining.
Absolute monsoon on steroids.

142
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,416
<i>We were taken back to the hotel
in the back of an open pickup.</i>

143
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Literally cowering behind the cab
to try and get out of the rain.

144
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,708
John and I had to share a double bed.

145
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,958
We...

146
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,333
One... We did top and tail.

147
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,583
<i>So, the next morning, John and I
set off from the entrance chamber</i>

148
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,875
<i>with all our equipment,
our cylinders on our harness.</i>

149
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,041
<i>Nobody came in the cave with us.</i>

150
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,208
<i>Only 200 meters from the entrance,</i>

151
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,750
<i>the water met the rock
and it was a proper sump dive.</i>

152
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,250
<i>From the entrance chamber,
now to the second and third chamber,</i>

153
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,625
<i>was a river, a raging river.</i>

154
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,833
<i>So, the term I would use
is "white water caving."</i>

155
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,333
<i>Very poor visibility.</i>

156
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,541
<i>Really brown, really chocolaty brown.</i>

157
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,833
<i>There's a ton of man-made hazards as well.
Telephone wire...</i>

158
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,625
<i>cables. All sorts of things.</i>

159
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,208
<i>We surfaced
in what became known as "Chamber Three."</i>

160
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,041
<i>We thought
we'd found four of the football team.</i>

161
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,875
<i>They were pump workers.
They had been asleep on the sandbank,</i>

162
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,500
<i>missed the evacuation
and got flooded into the cave.</i>

163
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,166
<i>And nobody knew they were missing.</i>

164
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,101
<i>We didn't know if that chamber
was going to flood completely</i>

165
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,625
<i>in hours or minutes.</i>

166
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,583
<i>We needed to dive
these four guys out immediately.</i>

167
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:29,125
<i>They were terrified,
but they didn't have another option.</i>

168
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,916
<i>We just gave them a regulator
from one of the cylinders</i>

169
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,458
<i>that was still attached to us.</i>

170
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,059
<i>So, we have to keep them very close to us</i>

171
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,142
<i>or the regulator in their mouth
is going to be pulled out</i>

172
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,886
<i>and they're not going to be able
to breathe.</i>

173
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,583
<i>It's highly disorientating being led,</i>

174
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,458
<i>basically blind, underwater.</i>

175
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,416
<i>It was quite brutal,
they were banging their heads,</i>

176
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,601
<i>we were moving them around,
trying to find the right hole</i>

177
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,625
<i>for them to go through.</i>

178
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,208
<i>All of the pump workers reacted the same,</i>

179
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,791
<i>the second they thought
they were under airspace,</i>

180
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:19,250
<i>they kind of bolted up
without any thought.</i>

181
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>I described it
as an underwater wrestling match.</i>

182
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,083
After getting the pump workers out

183
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,083
we didn't turn around
and go back in the cave,

184
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,333
it was too dangerous.

185
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,543
<i>The four water workers,
they were underwater</i>

186
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,041
<i>for only 30, 40 seconds...</i>

187
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,791
<i>but they still panicked
and they were adults.</i>

188
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,750
<i>Now, we were talking
about a group of children.</i>

189
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,166
<i>We didn't think it was possible for us
to dive the children out.</i>

190
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,000
<i>Even if they were alive,
it can't be done.</i>

191
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,708
<i>Now, what the hell are we gonna do now?</i>

192
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,892
<i>The Thais were all praying</i>

193
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,166
<i>for success in the mission.</i>

194
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:46,875
They believed that success could only come
if they had the permission

195
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,750
from the guardian spirit.

196
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,791
<i>I know as soon as I got down,
I had to pay respects to those shrines.</i>

197
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:07,851
<i>It has been
seven days since this team of 12 Thai boys</i>

198
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:11,041
<i>and their football coach has been missing
in this vast cave complex.</i>

199
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:13,245
<i>Water levels in the cave have been rising,</i>

200
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,500
<i>going up overnight
by six inches every hour.</i>

201
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:18,976
<i>High water levels
have made the search very challenging,</i>

202
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
<i>but divers use huge pumps
to reduce some of that water.</i>

203
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,434
<i>Now, volunteers have been traveling</i>

204
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,916
<i>to northern Thailand
to help with the rescue operation.</i>

205
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,184
<i>This has become,
really, a worldwide rescue effort.</i>

206
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,833
<i>Volunteers from Europe,
Australia, Asia and the U.S.</i>

207
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,416
Today, I am training
in the Khao Yai National Park.

208
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,541
- You need gasoline for...
- One thousand...

209
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:02,791
<i>That evening,
we met the American military</i>

210
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,750
<i>who had deployed from Japan.</i>

211
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,500
<i>Rick and John
were very laid back, you know?</i>

212
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:12,333
They were definitely not
what you're used to seeing

213
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:15,958
in the military.
Shorts and flip flops and T-shirts.

214
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,642
<i>But, as I started speaking with them,</i>

215
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,375
<i>I realized that they were very,
very highly skilled.</i>

216
00:24:21,791 --> 00:24:25,541
I had gone in myself to Chamber Three
where I had to do a couple of short dives,

217
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,666
but I was thinking to myself,
"Man, this is absolutely horrible."

218
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:33,125
I remember John kind of laughed at me
because he knew the next question I had,

219
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,041
"Why would someone do this for fun?"

220
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,958
Cave diving for me is relaxing.

221
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,375
Nobody tells you what to do...

222
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:46,125
your time is your own.
It's very liberating.

223
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:49,500
But having said that, most of the time
it is jumping into a muddy hole.

224
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:50,750
That's exactly right.

225
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,708
<i>Caving is clearly
about the exploration side of it.</i>

226
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:09,458
Some of the dives we do,
you could be hours in,

227
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:13,875
<i>totally reliant on artificial light,
artificial heating.</i>

228
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,625
<i>It's like being in space.</i>

229
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:19,958
<i>Probably the purest adventure
you could have.</i>

230
00:25:24,375 --> 00:25:28,125
<i>It takes a peculiar type of person
to be a cave diving explorer.</i>

231
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,833
<i>What makes someone want to be
an explorer?</i>

232
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:41,958
I think it's two parts ego,
one part curiosity,

233
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,666
one part, um...

234
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,041
um, lack of confidence in yourself
and a need to prove yourself.

235
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,125
<i>You know, maybe I was no good
at footy and cricket,</i>

236
00:25:57,208 --> 00:26:00,166
<i>but at least I can, you know,
cave dive quite well.</i>

237
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,416
I think it's fair to say all of us
were not team players.

238
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,416
None of us are very good
with ball skills.

239
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,125
I was a loser.

240
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:11,500
I'm terrible at team sports.

241
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:15,500
<i>I think "doesn't play well with others"
is the phrase that you're looking for.</i>

242
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,583
<i>I was quiet and shy
and didn't like confrontation.</i>

243
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:21,500
<i>I wasn't so sociable.</i>

244
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,833
I was bullied a bit as a teenager, yeah,
'cause I was a little bit different.

245
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I've got a lazy left eye.

246
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,931
Which, when I was younger,
actually pointed in the wrong direction.

247
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:32,458
Which is quite funny looking back on it

248
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:36,166
'cause it was quite a big part
of my life at the time,

249
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,958
like, it was quite a self...

250
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:42,916
I was quite self-conscious about it,
you know? Kids are mean.

251
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:48,333
<i>There's no question
that in my younger years</i>

252
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,750
I started off
perhaps emotionally challenged.

253
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,583
Yeah, I wasn't the most social person.
A bit of bullying at school and stuff,

254
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,166
<i>but the worst people
I've blocked out of my mind.</i>

255
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,833
But once I get underground,
that all disappears.

256
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,916
<i>Can't see anything,
just my bubbles.</i>

257
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:10,875
<i>Isolated.</i>

258
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,833
<i>It's the place where I,
kind of feel comfortable</i>

259
00:27:13,916 --> 00:27:15,500
and feel like, I...

260
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
feel safe.

261
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,333
Quiet and peace.

262
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,875
Get away from everything
in normal society.

263
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,416
Back to the age of the cave man.

264
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,416
<i>It comes back
to that kind of ability</i>

265
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:40,500
<i>to expand your comfort zone...</i>

266
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:44,458
<i>but probably
some people's worst nightmares.</i>

267
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:54,541
<i>It's about controlling
your emotions and your fear...</i>

268
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,958
<i>because panic is death in the cave.</i>

269
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:13,750
<i>There is still a reason for optimism.
Medical experts say it is possible</i>

270
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,958
<i>to stay alive for this period of time
without food.</i>

271
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:21,916
<i>But in an operation like this, every hour
is important. And every hour...</i>

272
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,250
<i>Even when it's not raining,
rescuers say water is continuing</i>

273
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,750
<i>to seep into the cave.</i>

274
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:30,125
They're up in the mountains right now
trying to divert it away.

275
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:35,375
You have to hike, and then you have
to actually look for places

276
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,750
where the water, like, disappears.

277
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:42,416
<i>If we found cracks,
we laid out plastic bags,</i>

278
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,708
<i>and divert the water
by using sandbags and a pipe.</i>

279
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,601
<i>You know, just behind us,
there's some heavy equipment</i>

280
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:55,083
<i>that's just been brought in here
to pump out more water from the caves.</i>

281
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,833
<i>And Howard, we were talking yesterday</i>

282
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,375
<i>about the British divers
who've gone out there.</i>

283
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:03,458
<i>I asked them for an update,
but they walked past, very stony-faced.</i>

284
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,250
<i>They've been very media shy.</i>

285
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,208
<i>Actually, they've been keeping
their heads down</i>

286
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,833
<i>and getting on with the job.</i>

287
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,625
<i>The next morning,
we decided to see if we could progress.</i>

288
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:20,750
Now there was another guy on the scene,
a Belgian guy called Ben Reymenants.

289
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:28,166
<i>We met Ben when he was coming out
from his dive.</i>

290
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,916
<i>The three of us are chest deep
in water in this little pool.</i>

291
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,583
<i>He said it was impossible
to make progress.</i>

292
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,083
The flow was so strong,

293
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:39,416
that if I would've turned my head,
my mask would've been ripped off.

294
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,500
<i>My watch had broken against the rocks.</i>

295
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:44,833
<i>My dry suit was leaking.
I couldn't properly breath.</i>

296
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,525
"This is suicide. What am I doing?"

297
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:57,125
<i>We essentially agreed
that the conditions</i>

298
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:59,291
<i>in the cave were impossible.</i>

299
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,291
<i>The monsoon had come early,</i>

300
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,750
<i>and it wasn't going to let up
for many months.</i>

301
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:20,541
<i>There was a very strong feeling
that the children couldn't be still alive.</i>

302
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,583
<i>It just didn't... it didn't seem possible.</i>

303
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,833
<i>We lost hope.</i>

304
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,125
FEMALE VOICE 2:

305
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:37,458
FEMALE VOICE 3:

306
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:46,708
<i>The American contingent
also felt it's a lost cause.</i>

307
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:52,333
<i>We were really kind of just sat around
waiting for a body recovery.</i>

308
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,333
<i>Fancied Belgium come face to face</i>

309
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:07,833
<i>with the only Asian team left
in the competition...</i>

310
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,291
<i>People had their mobile phones
and were looking at the World Cup.</i>

311
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,750
<i>We just sat around.
We were quite despondent,</i>

312
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,416
<i>with the fate of those children
in our thoughts.</i>

313
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:23,291
<i>We started to wonder,
"Do we actually need to be here?"</i>

314
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:28,666
We reached out to the British consular,
saying, "Can he sort some flights out?"

315
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,625
And that didn't go down very well.

316
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,684
<i>They're doing everything possible</i>

317
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,583
<i>to stem the flow of water
into the cave system.</i>

318
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:45,416
Standing here four days ago
I would've been knee deep in water.

319
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,791
It's quite a feat of engineering.

320
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,101
<i>Rick and I went
to the Americans and said, "Look,</i>

321
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,125
<i>"We want to get back in the game.
Can you help us?"</i>

322
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:13,166
<i>So, eventually, the Thais
allowed us back in the cave.</i>

323
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,791
<i>On that Sunday morning,</i>

324
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:19,333
<i>Ben had done quite a bit of work
continuing the line of the SEALs.</i>

325
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:23,250
<i>I give credit to Ben and the SEALs
for persevering</i>

326
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:25,708
<i>when we thought
it was absolutely impossible.</i>

327
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:31,416
I am extremely disappointed in myself...

328
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:36,916
that we kind of gave up when we did.
That shouldn't have happened.

329
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,791
<i>We laid line on Sunday.</i>

330
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:48,458
<i>The next day, John and I took another
two bags of rope to continue it.</i>

331
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:55,083
<i>One of the golden rules of cave diving
is to have a continuous line</i>

332
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:57,000
<i>between you and safety.</i>

333
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,666
<i>After two or three hours,
we reached a junction.</i>

334
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:16,250
<i>Which is about 800 meters
beyond Chamber Three.</i>

335
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:21,500
<i>Tham Luang is one
of the longest caves in Thailand.</i>

336
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:28,666
<i>The cave lies under
the Doi Nang Non mountain range.</i>

337
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:38,083
<i>From the entrance,
it's 800 meters to Chamber Three.</i>

338
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:44,875
<i>Chamber Three had enough dry land
that the SEALs were in residence there.</i>

339
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:50,666
<i>And then beyond that, you were largely
in the water the whole way.</i>

340
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,708
<i>The next feature is the T-junction.</i>

341
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,291
<i>Two underground rivers
unite at the T-junction</i>

342
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:59,041
<i>and then flow to the entrance.</i>

343
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:05,125
<i>We thought the possible places
where the kids could've found sanctuary</i>

344
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,375
<i>was a place called Pattaya Beach.</i>

345
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:11,208
Pattaya Beach is the most
comfortable area.

346
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:13,250
It was the highest area as well.

347
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:19,583
<i>We progressed by feel
and dead reckoning.</i>

348
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:22,250
<i>We've no idea what we're going to find.</i>

349
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,250
So, I was just feeling around in the murk.

350
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:32,458
<i>We had no idea whether we were going
to encounter dead bodies.</i>

351
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:35,583
We were stealing ourselves
from that eventuality.

352
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,708
I know what I was prepared to bump into

353
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:41,166
because I'd visualized it very,
very carefully.

354
00:36:42,541 --> 00:36:46,708
<i>I'm a great believer in visualization.
I try and put emotions in a box.</i>

355
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,083
<i>I can visualize a shelf,</i>

356
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,416
and I put the box on the top shelf
and I leave it there,

357
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:54,000
and I do what I need to do.

358
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,166
<i>As we got to any airspace,
I took my mask off and had a sniff.</i>

359
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,125
<i>Caves have got a very neutral smell.</i>

360
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:12,875
You'd easily smell people
that had been in there for ten days,

361
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:15,333
<i>defecating, decaying.</i>

362
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,767
<i>Rick and I had already discussed</i>

363
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:22,458
<i>that we would lay the thick line
as far as we could.</i>

364
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,458
<i>And then I had a reel
of 200 meters of thinner line.</i>

365
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:29,541
<i>We would use these to give us
maximum possible reach into the cave.</i>

366
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,791
<i>Everyone had held their hopes out
that the children were at this place</i>

367
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:40,375
<i>called Pattaya Beach.</i>

368
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:44,375
<i>We did know from the survey
that was the only section of the cave</i>

369
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:46,000
<i>that traveled due east.</i>

370
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:52,375
<i>So, when our compasses
started to point east...</i>

371
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:58,041
<i>we were at the mythical Pattaya Beach.</i>

372
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,041
<i>Everything was underwater.</i>

373
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:06,166
<i>We actually retraced our route there
a few times.</i>

374
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:10,583
<i>But there was absolutely nowhere
a group of people could have survived.</i>

375
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,041
I was getting quite keen to turn around

376
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,541
because I was way beyond
any sensible air margin.

377
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,833
<i>Rule number one,
use a third of your air on the way in,</i>

378
00:38:23,916 --> 00:38:26,500
<i>a third on the way out,
and you keep a third for spare.</i>

379
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:31,333
<i>But I just had
this powerful feeling that...</i>

380
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:37,291
just that it was time to push.
It was the right time to push.

381
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:48,000
<i>So, we continue upstream...</i>

382
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,166
<i>trying to follow the flow.</i>

383
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,291
<i>It was instantaneous.</i>

384
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,833
<i>A pungent smell.</i>

385
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,750
<i>Silence.</i>

386
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:37,166
<i>We both assumed
we were smelling decomposing bodies.</i>

387
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,333
<i>There's something unpleasant here.</i>

388
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:47,125
<i>And then, suddenly, I saw a light flash.</i>

389
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,375
<i>John immediately got out the camera.</i>

390
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:04,083
John, light it up. Yeah, best you can.

391
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,250
How many of you?

392
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:09,958
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?

393
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,583
- Yeah, thirteen.
- Brilliant.

394
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,750
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:17,416
Believe. Believe.

396
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,708
<i>On the audio, there's me saying "Believe."</i>

397
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,833
<i>That was me trying to tell me,
"This is real.</i>

398
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:26,916
<i>"This is actually happening."</i>

399
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,958
No. Not today.

400
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,833
- Please?
- Not today.

401
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,291
We have to dive.

402
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,416
We are coming. It's okay.

403
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,460
- It's okay.
- Many people are coming.

404
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,958
Many, many people.
We are the first. Many people come.

405
00:40:44,791 --> 00:40:47,041
Tomorrow. No, no, no. What day is it now?

406
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,142
- I don't know...
- Monday, Monday.

407
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:58,375
Okay but one week and Monday.
You have been here ten days.

408
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,000
Ten days. You are very strong.

409
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:04,791
Very strong.

410
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:13,375
I don't know.
Okay, get back. We come. We come.

411
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,833
I know. I know. I understand.

412
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,166
We come. Okay. We come.

413
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:31,517
<i>We took our equipment off</i>

414
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:34,625
<i>on the other side of the passage
and made our way over to them.</i>

415
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:41,583
<i>I mean, clearly, John has a son.
And I haven't got children.</i>

416
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,958
I've structured my life to avoid children
as much as possible.

417
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:47,375
<i>But John is a cub master,</i>

418
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,380
<i>so he's used to dealing
with groups of children.</i>

419
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,291
Say... Thumbs up. Say, "Yay!"

420
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:52,500
- Yay!
- Yay!

421
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:55,125
<i>He got them to do
a motivational exercise.</i>

422
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,458
Everybody say, "Yeah!"

423
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,625
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

424
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,833
Excellent. Say, "Hello, Americans."

425
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:02,642
- Hello, Americans.
- Hello, Americans.

426
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,208
Hello, Thai Navy.

427
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:06,166
- Hello, Thai Navy.
- Hello, Thai Navy.

428
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,375
Say, "Hello, Australians."

429
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,291
- Hello, Australia.
- Hello, Australia.

430
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:11,916
Hello, Chinese.

431
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,267
- Hello, Chinese.
- Hello, Chinese.

432
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:14,875
And thank you, everybody else.

433
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:17,017
- And thank you, everybody.
- And thank you, everybody.

434
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:18,791
Okay. We see you soon.

435
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:23,125
<i>As we left, pretty much all of them
came and hugged us individually.</i>

436
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,250
<i>I made them a promise
that I would come back.</i>

437
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,583
I am really happy you're here.

438
00:42:30,666 --> 00:42:32,375
We are happy too.

439
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:35,125
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

440
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,250
- Okay.
- So, where you come from?

441
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,416
- England, UK.
- Oh.

442
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,708
<i>As we went round the corner
and kitted up,</i>

443
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,833
total silence between me and John,
just...

444
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:50,208
looking to each other's faces thinking,

445
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,958
"We may be the only ones
that ever see them."

446
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,000
That was a distinct possibility.

447
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,166
<i>The whole journey back,
all I was thinking was,</i>

448
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,625
"What on earth are we going to do now?"

449
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:22,125
I surfaced first in Chamber Three
where the Thai Navy SEALs had their base.

450
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,291
Thirteen alive.

451
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:25,708
They're okay. Yeah.

452
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:30,750
You close.

453
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,559
We've got a message. This is...

454
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,309
Good job, man.

455
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,500
<i>The SEALs
immediately relayed the news</i>

456
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:50,833
<i>to the outside.</i>

457
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,375
<i>Shortly after we exited,</i>

458
00:43:53,583 --> 00:43:56,458
<i>the footage was released
all over the world.</i>

459
00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:59,165
<i>Live images coming out of Thailand.</i>

460
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,291
Dramatic breaking news.

461
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,791
<i>You are very strong.</i>

462
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,416
<i>A true miracle.</i>

463
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,383
The moment.

464
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,767
<i>Thailand's prayers have paid off.</i>

465
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

466
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:33,500
Your troops are doing
a really good job.

467
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,916
Back at you too.

468
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:37,125
What a remarkable turn of events.

469
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:57,166
I would like to say thank you to everyone.

470
00:45:02,208 --> 00:45:03,684
- We are team.
- Family.

471
00:45:03,708 --> 00:45:05,208
Yes, team, yes.

472
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:09,916
That night, there was as battle meeting
at the American camp with the Thai Navy.

473
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:14,166
<i>This was a formal meeting
with Rear Admiral Apakorn.</i>

474
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:19,250
<i>Rick and John told the Thais
finding the boys was the easy part,</i>

475
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,250
and they really didn't have a clue
how to get those kids out.

476
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:28,916
<i>Rear Admiral Apakorn thanked us
for our role of being path finders.</i>

477
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:33,583
<i>And he said, "The Thai SEALs
would take over chain of command</i>

478
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:36,458
<i>"and you will just be
in an advisory role."</i>

479
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,833
<i>Suddenly, it was like a navy going to war.</i>

480
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:32,583
<i>The Thai Navy SEALs
carried in vast quantities of equipment,</i>

481
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:34,750
<i>the piles of diving cylinders.</i>

482
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,666
The task was absolutely massive
and crucial.

483
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:56,708
<i>They had a lot of people
and a lot of equipment.</i>

484
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:00,125
<i>But we started to hear
that their first set of divers</i>

485
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:01,875
<i>had run into problems.</i>

486
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,767
<i>The four that were left</i>

487
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,000
<i>were effectively trapped in
with the children.</i>

488
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:15,666
<i>Authorities there are looking
at all of their options,</i>

489
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:16,750
<i>none of them easy.</i>

490
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:20,375
<i>Right now, the preferable option
is to keep them down there.</i>

491
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,041
It could be months
to get those boys out safely.

492
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,434
<i>Sending in supplies
and waiting until the season</i>

493
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:28,875
<i>of the monsoons and flooding is over,
they said that could be till October.</i>

494
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:31,434
<i>The search also continues
in the hills and jungle</i>

495
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,333
<i>above the cave complex.
Workers looking for any way</i>

496
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,875
<i>to get into the cave
beyond the flooded sections.</i>

497
00:49:37,625 --> 00:49:39,601
<i>Another possibility they're looking at</i>

498
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:43,333
is drilling new entries into the caves
so they can pull them out.

499
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,601
<i>Creating the shaft large enough</i>

500
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:49,000
will be extremely complicated
and could take a long time.

501
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:52,791
<i>The only real alternative
is to pump out the water.</i>

502
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:57,166
<i>They're pumping out
something like 1.6 million liters of water</i>

503
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,000
and it only went down one centimeter.

504
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:10,250
<i>There's almost a one in a billion chance</i>

505
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,750
<i>that any of these things
could have worked.</i>

506
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:16,458
<i>And so the Americans were getting worried,</i>

507
00:50:16,625 --> 00:50:19,875
<i>and they were asking us,
"Was there anything that we could do?"</i>

508
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:24,000
<i>We said we didn't think it was possible
for us to dive the children out.</i>

509
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,541
<i>The experience with the four pump workers</i>

510
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,430
was an indication of that,
where they couldn't even hold it together

511
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,708
for 30 seconds,
let alone two-and-a-half-hours.

512
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:34,958
<i>We said it can't be done.</i>

513
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,708
I was like, "Well, what if it could?"

514
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:42,000
<i>What does the impossible look like?</i>

515
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,041
<i>When we got back
to our resort that night,</i>

516
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,125
<i>we continued thinking it through.</i>

517
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:02,708
I texted an old friend,
Dr. Richard Harris from Australia.

518
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:09,458
<i>It was on a Thursday,
the 5th of July,</i>

519
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,708
<i>when I started
exchanging messages with Rick.</i>

520
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:17,833
<i>I said, "Is it possible
to anesthetize the children?"</i>

521
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,416
My immediate response to Rick
was, "Absolutely not. It's not possible."

522
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:27,166
<i>Early one morning,
Harry's phone had been</i>

523
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:30,541
<i>pinging away all night, and I had a look,
and I saw the message from Rick saying,</i>

524
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:35,166
"What do you think about sedating
the boys and diving them out?"

525
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:41,166
And I actually laughed.
I laughed. It just sounded ludicrous.

526
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,166
I could think of a 100 ways
a child would die very quickly.

527
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:50,458
For example, to maintain your airway,
you know, you need to keep their chin up.

528
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:53,375
At any time during the dive,
the child's airway could obstruct.

529
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:56,750
They would asphyxiate.
Their sinuses could fill up with blood.

530
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,625
They could drown in their own saliva.

531
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:01,083
Honestly, I could talk for an hour
about the ways

532
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:03,000
that I thought these kids could die.

533
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:09,625
<i>So, the next morning,
we had a proper voice conversation,</i>

534
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,708
<i>and he said he was willing
to consider it, give it some thought.</i>

535
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:24,375
<i>At the same time, we realized
it's two days since we'd found them</i>

536
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,250
<i>and no proper meals had gone in.</i>

537
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:33,541
<i>We took it upon ourselves to scrounge
some ration packs off the Americans.</i>

538
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,500
<i>It just seemed a bit ludicrous to me,</i>

539
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,708
<i>relying on bracelets.</i>

540
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:12,083
<i>I said, "Rick, those kids
really believe in spirits.</i>

541
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:16,583
<i>"It will improve their morale.
It really is important."</i>

542
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,416
Then he calmed down. He said,

543
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:22,166
"Okay, just leave... Put 'em in.
I'll take them in there."

544
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,125
<i>It was a desperate struggle</i>

545
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:35,833
<i>dragging these two huge bags of food
against the current.</i>

546
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,583
<i>My most difficult dive yet.</i>

547
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,708
<i>When we got to the children
they were really excited to see us.</i>

548
00:53:49,875 --> 00:53:51,166
<i>Their morale was good.</i>

549
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:55,083
<i>We passed the bracelets
out to the boys one by one.</i>

550
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:58,375
<i>And they knew what they were,
reaching their hands out to get them.</i>

551
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:02,500
<i>Dr. Bhak put two of the boys
to work stacking the food</i>

552
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,166
<i>in neat, orderly piles,
they didn't tear into it.</i>

553
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,541
<i>As they were eating,</i>

554
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:27,250
<i>both John and I felt the air
was starting to feel a little bit stale.</i>

555
00:54:28,125 --> 00:54:29,458
I think it's recording.

556
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:33,833
<i>The effort of climbing the slope,
the panting that was required.</i>

557
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:37,471
Let's just do a count down. Hang on.

558
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:45,041
<i>So, I turned the oxygen monitor on
and it immediately went into full alarm...</i>

559
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,500
<i>and registered 15 percent.</i>

560
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:52,416
For the oxygen, anything under 18 percent

561
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,750
is not sustainable to life
in the long term.

562
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,416
<i>I couldn't look the children
in their eyes.</i>

563
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,791
<i>Breaking news right now out of Thailand.</i>

564
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:11,958
<i>We just found out that
a Thai Navy SEAL working to save</i>

565
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:16,041
<i>those young boys inside that deep,
dark cave has died.</i>

566
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,666
The man who died was young, he was fit,
he was a former Navy SEAL.

567
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,458
<i>Authorities say, "38-year-old Saman Gunan,
who'd rejoined the SEALs</i>

568
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:28,000
<i>"solely to help the search,
died from lack of oxygen."</i>

569
00:55:43,125 --> 00:55:44,892
<i>The bundle of neoprene wetsuits</i>

570
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,166
<i>was really buoyant</i>

571
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,750
<i>and it would've been
a huge burden to take in.</i>

572
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:54,166
On his way back, he ran out of air
fairly close to the third chamber.

573
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,392
<i>Unfortunately, it was Saman.</i>

574
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,375
<i>It could've been another one earlier on.</i>

575
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,000
<i>Saman is in the SEALs.</i>

576
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:26,250
<i>They were operating in an environment
they're not used to.</i>

577
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,583
<i>None of them had dived in caves</i>

578
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:32,125
<i>and the kit they had
was completely unsuitable.</i>

579
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,875
<i>They were unbelievably brave.</i>

580
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:50,083
<i>The moment Saman Gunan died,
the Rear Admiral said,</i>

581
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,291
<i>"We won't be diving
to the boys any further."</i>

582
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,750
And from that time on,
there was no further diving

583
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:58,041
by Thai SEALs beyond Chamber Three.

584
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:03,666
The Thai Navy SEALs
put everything they had into it.

585
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,625
They risked their lives,
I would say, more than the Brits.

586
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:12,041
<i>But they didn't have the skill set,
and they couldn't quite figure out</i>

587
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,833
why these old men were a lot better
at doing it than them.

588
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:21,333
<i>But no special force in the world
has those skills.</i>

589
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:25,333
<i>Only this private group of people
who do it as a weekend hobby.</i>

590
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:33,041
<i>The moment I found the boys,
Amp said that I totally changed.</i>

591
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:37,333
The responsibility despite not officially
being on my shoulders

592
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:39,416
was morally on my shoulders.

593
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,625
<i>It had to be us.</i>

594
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:53,208
<i>In the morning, I had
a chat with Harry. I told him the truth.</i>

595
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,958
<i>I said sedation was the only option.</i>

596
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,583
<i>He said he'd come out to help us,
but not to sedate them.</i>

597
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:04,875
Maybe I sounded like I just thought
this would be a good jolly

598
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,583
or a good adventure to Rick.
Because he said to me on the phone...

599
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:11,750
"If you come here,
and you dive to the children,

600
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:13,558
"and you're not prepared to sedate them,

601
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,958
"you will see the children
and they will die."

602
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:26,375
This plan, still so preposterous.
Surely this is not gonna work.

603
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:29,666
<i>And the thought of just bringing out
the bodies of these kids</i>

604
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,458
<i>was just too much for me.</i>

605
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:36,666
How many times
have you had to remove bodies...

606
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,833
which have been left in caves?

607
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:45,750
It's not quite double figures,
but I think it's around nine, I think.

608
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:51,166
<i>I went to Mexico in 1994</i>

609
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:54,125
<i>in a very deep cave,
1,000-meter-deep cave.</i>

610
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:57,541
<i>My best friend was operating
as a diver on that project</i>

611
00:59:57,791 --> 01:00:00,166
<i>and he had an incident and he did die.</i>

612
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:08,208
It was traumatic, 'cause he was such
a close friend, and it was so hands-on.

613
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:11,208
He wasn't in a stretcher,
he wasn't wrapped up.

614
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:20,333
<i>Despite Harry's skepticism, I became more
and more convinced this was the only way.</i>

615
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,208
<i>So, the next morning,
I told Derek the concept.</i>

616
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:27,875
<i>I told him it's a horrible idea.
And then Rick said,</i>

617
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,458
"What if it's the only idea?"

618
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:32,000
<i>I was highly skeptical.</i>

619
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:35,208
But I believed in their talents
and their abilities.

620
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,642
<i>I asked,</i>

621
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,392
<i>"If you could put together
the best team in the world</i>

622
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:51,000
"of guys that you would need to do this,
who would it be?"

623
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,892
<i>I had a message from John saying,</i>

624
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:58,000
"We don't think the time and treatment
can affect the evacuation.

625
01:00:58,083 --> 01:00:59,803
"That means we need you
and you need Jason."

626
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,625
<i>I was climbing
the internal structure of a building,</i>

627
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:06,250
checked my phone, and Chris says,
"We're flying out tonight."

628
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,333
<i>I was a couple of days
from the end of my holiday,</i>

629
01:01:12,416 --> 01:01:14,250
on my way down a mountain in Italy.

630
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:17,291
<i>I get a text saying,
"How soon can you be ready?"</i>

631
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:19,958
I was ringing my boss to get time off.

632
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:26,500
I was actually meant to attend
my friend's stag do on that Saturday.

633
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,458
<i>When I realized I was gonna be
headed over to Thailand,</i>

634
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:36,125
<i>I went in to visit my dad
in the nursing home.</i>

635
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,541
<i>His dad, he didn't understand
the cave diving thing.</i>

636
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:46,958
Definitely less than me,
and they had a bit of a long running joke.

637
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:50,083
He would constantly ask
when I was gonna give up cave diving,

638
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:53,666
'cause it worried him, obviously.
And I'd always joke with him, saying,

639
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,083
"Oh, actually, that was my last dive,
I'm finished now."

640
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,968
And he'd go,
"That's great. I'm so relieved."

641
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,934
And then he'd look at me
and then roar with laughter

642
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:02,833
as he'd realized I was pulling his leg.

643
01:02:02,916 --> 01:02:06,083
So, we had a good chat,
and then I headed off the next day.

644
01:02:20,541 --> 01:02:22,541
<i>So, when we arrived at the cave,</i>

645
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:27,041
<i>we step out of this minivan
to a sea of cameras staring us down.</i>

646
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:30,791
<i>I found it really frightening actually.</i>

647
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:36,458
<i>We found John and Rick,
and they looked a bit shagged.</i>

648
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:39,833
<i>The first thing I said was,</i>

649
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,333
"Look, I've got to dive the cave,
get to the end, see the kids myself,

650
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,041
"convince myself that there's no other way
to get them out."

651
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:51,125
<i>My partner, Craig,
and I swam to the children.</i>

652
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,458
It was just a muddy hole, really.

653
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,041
<i>As I surfaced,
the filth floating on the water</i>

654
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,833
<i>meant we were in the final chamber
where the kids were.</i>

655
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,142
<i>When I realized I was actually
about to meet these boys,</i>

656
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,958
<i>of course,
I thought about my own children.</i>

657
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,125
<i>I was slightly horrified
how thin they looked.</i>

658
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:21,125
<i>And I could hear a couple
of them coughing, pretty wet coughs.</i>

659
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,708
<i>They looked weak to me,
but it's incredible to me still</i>

660
01:03:25,791 --> 01:03:31,000
<i>that there was not one trembling lip,
not a tear, not any sign of any concern.</i>

661
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,142
<i>I just spent
the whole time swimming out</i>

662
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,250
<i>and thinking about what we were gonna do.</i>

663
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:02,333
<i>And I guess that's when I decided that,</i>

664
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:06,000
<i>"Yeah, I'm just gonna have
to get on board with this plan."</i>

665
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,750
At that point, we need the bodies,
the guys who were able

666
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:18,708
to help alleviate some
of the work load off John and Rick.

667
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:23,875
We were kind of a team
that's living in Thailand already.

668
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:29,583
Kind of the technical dive instructors.
Most of us were from Europe.

669
01:04:30,291 --> 01:04:32,500
We rolled them in immediately
into our team.

670
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:36,958
<i>The team was ready,
but the Thai authorities</i>

671
01:04:37,166 --> 01:04:43,083
were still unwilling to make a decision
and give the go ahead.

672
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,500
Conditions worsening,
air supply dwindling,

673
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:58,750
and the other concern looming
is the monsoon rain in the forecast.

674
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,833
<i>We now had two ticking clocks,
the oxygen and the weather.</i>

675
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:06,000
<i>Afternoon as we get thunderstorms
that developed,</i>

676
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:08,750
<i>this is a tell-tale sign
of the monsoons really.</i>

677
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:20,125
The Thai Navy SEALs want zero risk.
That's not gonna happen.

678
01:05:21,708 --> 01:05:25,250
<i>But what appeared to tip the balance
was a gentleman called, "Josh Morris."</i>

679
01:05:26,625 --> 01:05:29,708
<i>When I arrived, I said,
"I have a climbing and caving school,</i>

680
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:32,875
<i>"and I speak Thai."
Thanet and I were working together.</i>

681
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:38,416
Then I bumped into Vern, who let me know,
kind of, things weren't so hunky-dory.

682
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:42,541
I have access to, like... So, I...

683
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:45,642
- So, they won't listen to us now.
- I just bumped into him this morning,

684
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:48,833
and I'd be happy to communicate for you.
Shall I take notes?

685
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:53,541
<i>John was visibly stressed.
And he said, "If it rains,</i>

686
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,208
"and the waters come up,
nobody's getting in that cave.

687
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:58,500
"The conditions are terrible in there.

688
01:05:58,583 --> 01:06:00,351
"They're in those blankets
and everybody looks happy,

689
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,541
"but the room stinks,

690
01:06:03,041 --> 01:06:06,250
they don't have any food, they've got
cuts, like, they're gonna get sick."

691
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,500
I said, "What are you talking about?
I haven't heard any of that.

692
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,541
"How much food do they have?"
And he said,

693
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,083
"They've got about a 100 meals."

694
01:06:14,166 --> 01:06:17,208
- Oxygen is at what level now? Do we know?
- So we measured it at 15.

695
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:20,458
But we're not... It could be 16 percent.

696
01:06:21,375 --> 01:06:23,166
You know we play it safe.

697
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:26,916
How about the dive?
How do you guys feel about that?

698
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:31,041
It's exceptionally, exceptionally risky.
But they haven't got any other chance.

699
01:06:31,166 --> 01:06:32,392
You don't think there's any chance?

700
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:34,136
- If they don't dive...
- Are you recording?

701
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:46,083
<i>Finally, we got the audience
we needed that night.</i>

702
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:49,375
The Minister of the Interior came,
and everybody ended up

703
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:52,250
in the room together,
and I helped to translate.

704
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,958
<i>We just walked them through the plan.</i>

705
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,184
<i>I think the biggest questions
that people were having still</i>

706
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:03,000
<i>was, like, the risk, you know? And like,
I told 'em, "It's extremely risky.</i>

707
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,541
"But if you could get one kid back
to their parents alive,

708
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:07,333
"that to me would be a success."

709
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:11,375
<i>They asked me lots of questions.</i>

710
01:07:11,583 --> 01:07:14,333
"Why was I choosing this drug?
Why was I choosing these doses?"

711
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:18,208
And I had to keep emphasizing to them,
"Look, this is my best guess,

712
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:23,041
<i>"nobody's ever done it before,
I am totally open to a better suggestion."</i>

713
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:26,208
I remember feeling like
a used car salesman

714
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:30,291
who was trying to sell an old bomb
to some unsuspecting people...

715
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:34,125
um, and I just... I felt like just a liar.

716
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:37,153
<i>They kept asking,
"Can we just leave them in there?"</i>

717
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,083
<i>That kept coming back on the table.</i>

718
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:41,088
<i>And I said,
"Well, we're running out of oxygen."</i>

719
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:44,375
Also, we calculated 2,000 meals
we'd have to bring in.

720
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:47,958
And once the rain started again
you couldn't swim against those flows.

721
01:07:50,041 --> 01:07:53,166
<i>And then Thanet and I
ended back up in another meeting.</i>

722
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:55,416
<i>At one point I said to the minister,</i>

723
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:58,166
"The only guarantee I can give you
is that if you don't dive,

724
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,375
"everyone will die.

725
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:04,000
<i>"I don't envy you, sir.
Both choices are terrible,</i>

726
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,000
"but one is worse than the other."

727
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,500
<i>Still, the following morning,
we didn't have the go ahead,</i>

728
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:21,708
but we came up
with an actual, logistical plan,

729
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:25,208
the real nuts and bolts
of how it was going to work.

730
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:31,833
<i>How we were going to transport the boys
to how we were gonna package them.</i>

731
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:35,541
The cylinder was going to go
on the front of the child, not the back.

732
01:08:36,666 --> 01:08:40,083
So that when they were floating face down,
that tank would act like a keel.

733
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:44,458
<i>We worked out that you needed
positive pressure masks...</i>

734
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:48,208
so if you made a leak,
it'd go outwards and not inwards.

735
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,458
<i>And the Americans happened
to have four of these masks.</i>

736
01:08:52,625 --> 01:08:57,541
So, that meant we'd go in multiple times.
We had to go in every day, for three days.

737
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,091
<i>There was a demonstration
that was done,</i>

738
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:02,541
<i>the Americans called it a rock drill.</i>

739
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:05,458
<i>A big drill called
the rehearsal of concept.</i>

740
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,500
We kind of simulated the extraction
as best we could.

741
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:13,750
MALE VOICE 2:

742
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,541
MALE VOICE 3:

743
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:17,059
If the water comes up...

744
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:20,375
<i>It was useful, but it was more useful
for people making the decisions.</i>

745
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,416
They suddenly realized that, sort of,
there is some method to the madness,

746
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,166
<i>and maybe we could pull it off.</i>

747
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,875
One of the foreign affairs guys
from Australia came up to me and said,

748
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:35,625
"Look, in the...
in the interest of full disclosure,

749
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:38,041
"I just need to tell you
that if something goes wrong

750
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:40,750
"during the rescue, it's not impossible

751
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:43,625
"that you could end up
in the Thai judicial system."

752
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:45,267
And I said,
"What? You mean, 'imprisonment'?"

753
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:47,434
And he said, "Yeah,
that's sort of the worst-case scenario,

754
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:48,978
"and the rules here are pretty harsh."

755
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,250
<i>If things had gone wrong,</i>

756
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:56,333
public opinion would have turned
against them very quickly.

757
01:09:57,958 --> 01:10:00,291
<i>There was an extraction plan in place.</i>

758
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:04,375
To put us in a van,
drive us cross-country on back roads

759
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,875
to the embassy compound.
So, all very James Bond-esque.

760
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:11,125
<i>There is a green privacy screen</i>

761
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,916
<i>that has now been put up,
blocking the entrance to the cave.</i>

762
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,666
<i>This is perhaps another indication
this rescue could be incredibly close.</i>

763
01:10:22,875 --> 01:10:25,916
It was about 2:00 in the morning
that the Minister for the Interior said,

764
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,791
"Okay, assume the plans
going ahead tomorrow,

765
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,458
"um, and we'll give you the green light
in the morning."

766
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,541
<i>We had a debrief every night,</i>

767
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:39,416
<i>and on the night
before the first rescue day,</i>

768
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,916
which incidentally
was our 28th wedding anniversary...

769
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:47,875
But I spoke to him that night,
and he outlined what they were gonna do.

770
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:50,101
It was a terrible conversation,
'cause he said, "Look,

771
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,875
"I don't think it'll...

772
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:55,500
"work, I think they'll probably drown
under anesthetic."

773
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:01,541
<i>I slept very badly that night.
Lying in bed, I thought,</i>

774
01:11:01,666 --> 01:11:05,583
"Who am I to take this chance
to get the kids out this way?"

775
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:12,250
But to walk away and leave them in there,
that's impossible, you can't do it.

776
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:16,375
The other thing that gave me
the courage to go through with this

777
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:18,041
<i>was my dad.</i>

778
01:11:18,625 --> 01:11:21,166
<i>My dad was a doctor,
he was a vascular surgeon.</i>

779
01:11:21,666 --> 01:11:24,041
<i>The thing I've got from my father
more than anything</i>

780
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,916
<i>was the way to treat other people.</i>

781
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,750
<i>You know, he's a very generous man.</i>

782
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:34,833
<i>It was a good lesson to me
to try and treat people the way he did.</i>

783
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,976
<i>Reporters say
they've been ordered to get back.</i>

784
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,017
<i>There are rumors floating around the camp</i>

785
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:57,416
<i>that this rescue
could even be happening as soon as today.</i>

786
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:00,291
<i>The relatives
can only watch and wait anxiously.</i>

787
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,458
<i>For a final rescue, Thai medical teams</i>

788
01:12:02,541 --> 01:12:03,791
<i>are running rescue drills...</i>

789
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:07,083
<i>I got the Thai medical people, overnight,</i>

790
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:10,416
<i>to prepare all the drugs
into prefilled syringes.</i>

791
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:13,166
I had to basically teach
the rest of the divers

792
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:16,083
<i>how to top up the child
with another injection.</i>

793
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,392
<i>The boys were gonna be sedated
in the final chamber,</i>

794
01:12:19,416 --> 01:12:22,541
<i>but it would take more than two hours
to dive them out.</i>

795
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:24,833
<i>So, that sedative would wear off.</i>

796
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:29,166
It would be necessary for us
to readminister that sedative.

797
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:32,333
<i>So, we had a little anesthesia 101 class.</i>

798
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:35,000
<i>Basically I just said,
"Stick it in their leg,</i>

799
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:38,458
<i>"preferably on the outside of their thigh,
jab it through the wetsuit,</i>

800
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,333
<i>"and it doesn't matter
if you hit the bone.</i>

801
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:45,375
"Nothing could possibly go wrong."
Once again, lying through my teeth.

802
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:47,958
It's just to really give them
the courage to do it.

803
01:13:07,708 --> 01:13:12,583
I have ten divers ready to go
in the next 30 minutes.

804
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:21,416
The ropes team will consist
of six Americans,

805
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:26,375
<i>five Australians, five Chinese,
and six rope-specialist civilians.</i>

806
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,375
<i>Chamber Three, there will be</i>

807
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:31,875
<i>a Thai national coordination.</i>

808
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:40,916
<i>We cordoned off
our section of Chamber Three,</i>

809
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,708
we brought in 15 body bags
in case things did go south.

810
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:05,416
<i>I went straight to the end of the cave,
along with Jason and John and Harry.</i>

811
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:11,375
<i>We all know our position in the cave
and we went in roughly in that order.</i>

812
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:52,125
I got the first boy ready
with the help of the SEALs.

813
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:57,375
<i>We needed to put this hood on,
put his buoyancy jacket over...</i>

814
01:14:58,375 --> 01:15:02,000
<i>put these bungee cords around
ready for the cylinder.</i>

815
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:13,833
<i>It was a very simple combination
of drugs that I came up with.</i>

816
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:21,708
<i>Xanax was the tablet, which has
a very strong anti-anxiety effect.</i>

817
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:26,041
<i>Dr. Bhak had given the first tablet
to the first kid.</i>

818
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:43,166
<i>So, I injected
the atropine into one leg first,</i>

819
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:46,291
<i>which has an anti-salivation side effect,</i>

820
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,166
<i>because they could drown
in their own saliva potentially.</i>

821
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:51,958
And then, pretty much straight away

822
01:15:52,041 --> 01:15:55,041
followed it up with the injection
of ketamine in the other leg,

823
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:57,416
<i>which is the general anesthetic drug.</i>

824
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:02,416
<i>I'd hold up the syringe in front of them
and pat their leg to let them know</i>

825
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:04,125
<i>they're about to get an injection.</i>

826
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,142
<i>Once they were unconscious</i>

827
01:16:18,166 --> 01:16:20,791
<i>it was basically trying
to put a mask on a rag doll.</i>

828
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:28,375
<i>I didn't feel comfortable in any way,
shape or form about what we were doing.</i>

829
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,851
I mean, there were two things
that were really powerful,

830
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:32,750
and that is pushing
someone's face underwater

831
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,541
<i>who's unconscious,</i>

832
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,708
<i>and then tying their hands
behind their back.</i>

833
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:40,708
I mean, both those things feel very,
very wrong.

834
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:45,041
It felt like euthanasia to me.

835
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:54,416
<i>On that first trip,
Jason yelled back to me and said,</i>

836
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,500
"Oh, Harry, he's not breathing very much."

837
01:16:57,458 --> 01:17:00,875
<i>And I told the guys,
"This is a one-way trip,</i>

838
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:02,708
<i>"once you start you cannot stop.</i>

839
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:05,583
<i>"You can't come back to me,
'cause there's nothing I can do.</i>

840
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:08,500
"If you end up taking a body
out of the cave

841
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,541
"then that's what
you're taking out of the cave."

842
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:27,666
<i>In Chamber Eight, it felt like
we were waiting forever.</i>

843
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:32,291
Suddenly the line twitched.

844
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:36,625
<i>And Jason comes up with a child...</i>

845
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:39,541
<i>looking for a breath.</i>

846
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:46,125
I can only say that there was just
this huge tension in the air.

847
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:51,791
<i>The fact that he was still alive,
it was just</i>

848
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,666
<i>like a weight
had been lifted off my shoulders.</i>

849
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,750
But that was only 300 meters,

850
01:17:56,833 --> 01:17:59,583
they still had a kilometer-and-a-half
to get out of the cave.

851
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:04,791
<i>Then he actually started twitchin',
movin' the fingers,</i>

852
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:08,333
<i>he looked like a zombie.
Our eyes were agog with this.</i>

853
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:12,958
We gave 'em another injection there
and we transported him

854
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:15,291
<i>over the dry chamber
to the next flooded section.</i>

855
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:23,500
<i>John took the second child.</i>

856
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:28,541
I remember, John looked at me,
and he said, "What's his name?"

857
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:30,875
<i>"I don't know, John."</i>

858
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,958
<i>I was nervous.
I would go further than that,</i>

859
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,708
<i>I would say I was shitting myself.</i>

860
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:44,083
<i>As I swam him out, I just remember feeling
ownership and determination</i>

861
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:47,250
that I'll make damned sure
that my child survived.

862
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:52,291
<i>Chris took the third child.</i>

863
01:18:54,625 --> 01:18:57,750
<i>You couldn't see your hand
in front of your face.</i>

864
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,333
<i>Occasionally, you'll get a glimpse
of something through the murk.</i>

865
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:06,208
I remember trying to wriggle through holes
that I couldn't wriggle through.

866
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:10,166
<i>Finding a bigger space
and then that repeating again and again.</i>

867
01:19:12,708 --> 01:19:17,125
After the first submerged section,
I carried on out with the lad that I had.

868
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:23,166
<i>I surfaced in a deep water canal,
and there was no dry land.</i>

869
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,583
<i>But he was starting twitching again.</i>

870
01:19:31,291 --> 01:19:33,791
<i>So, I got my vials of ketamine out.</i>

871
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:40,708
<i>My hands are shaking 'cause I've
never given an injection before.</i>

872
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:45,333
<i>I managed to get one of the vials,
you've got a separate needle,</i>

873
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,000
took it out of its holder,
stabbed myself in the finger.

874
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,625
<i>I'm lucky that's not connected
to the vial of ketamine</i>

875
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:53,333
<i>otherwise there'd be two bodies
floating on the surface.</i>

876
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:56,333
<i>Gave him that injection.</i>

877
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,583
<i>True enough, he had stopped twitching.</i>

878
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:14,708
<i>John came to the chamber,
and the child didn't appear</i>

879
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,041
<i>to be breathing right.</i>

880
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,750
<i>I had to change
the oxygen cylinders for the child.</i>

881
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:25,250
And I couldn't get him
breathing again with the mask on.

882
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,000
Mask off.

883
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,541
<i>We'd take the mask off,
and it did improve,</i>

884
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:34,083
and then we put the mask back on
and it would get worse again.

885
01:20:34,416 --> 01:20:36,833
<i>And this went on
for a couple of times.</i>

886
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:40,166
<i>John was really worried.</i>

887
01:20:40,666 --> 01:20:44,000
<i>I wanted to bolt for the exit
and it would have been finished.</i>

888
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:45,333
Mask's all right.

889
01:20:45,583 --> 01:20:47,833
It really felt like a sheer act of will,

890
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:50,625
because every fiber in my being
wanted to be out.

891
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,083
<i>But I knew that I couldn't do that,</i>

892
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:56,208
because I knew I'd end up with a corpse
at the end rather than a child.

893
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,875
<i>By the time John left with the kid,
it looked like we did fix it.</i>

894
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:17,500
<i>When you got back
to the final flooded section</i>

895
01:21:17,583 --> 01:21:20,333
<i>that was always the hardest sump
to go through.</i>

896
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:22,875
<i>You couldn't fit through
with a kid on either side.</i>

897
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:30,250
We had to push him through first
and then you went through after him.

898
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:36,250
<i>And then, as you approach Chamber Three,
you'd hear the humming of the pumps.</i>

899
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,916
<i>I surfaced with the boy.</i>

900
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:46,375
<i>A dozen hands there
are ready to take the child off you,</i>

901
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:48,333
<i>straight into another stretcher.</i>

902
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,333
- Thirty kilos.
- Thirty kilos.

903
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:02,708
Kid number one's alive, breathing.
I think that was...

904
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:04,500
a huge morale boost.

905
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,083
One, two, three.

906
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:31,583
<i>I surfaced
in Chamber Three with my child.</i>

907
01:22:32,541 --> 01:22:33,708
<i>Relief.</i>

908
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,375
One, two, three, pull!

909
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:39,375
Pull!

910
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,291
Pull!

911
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:43,541
Pull!

912
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,416
Pull!

913
01:23:21,375 --> 01:23:24,916
<i>There are reports,
I must stress they are unconfirmed,</i>

914
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,125
<i>that two boys have now
emerged from the cave.</i>

915
01:23:28,291 --> 01:23:31,125
<i>Just seconds ago,
we saw another ambulance going in,</i>

916
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,375
<i>perhaps a third will be extracted.</i>

917
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,000
<i>I arrived with my boy...</i>

918
01:23:38,125 --> 01:23:39,541
handed this precious cargo off.

919
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,916
<i>I remember John saying to me,
"We've got three for three.</i>

920
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:48,750
<i>"Amazing, got three for three."</i>

921
01:23:49,125 --> 01:23:50,541
Then he looked at me, he said,

922
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,225
"Come on, Stanton, don't... it up.
We've gotta get four for four."

923
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,208
<i>Rick took the last child
and he headed out of the cave.</i>

924
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:03,250
I said to Dr. Bhak, "That's it.
"Let's do four tomorrow."

925
01:24:24,291 --> 01:24:26,625
<i>As I swam out to Chamber Eight,</i>

926
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:28,666
<i>completely zero visibility,</i>

927
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,708
<i>my hand's running along the rope...</i>

928
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,916
<i>and suddenly I put my hand on something
that felt like a dead fish.</i>

929
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,583
<i>Craig and Rick were looking quite anxious,
and they were saying, "Quick, get out."</i>

930
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:43,875
Hurry, he's not breathing.

931
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,041
<i>"We don't think this kid's breathing."
I quickly got my gear off.</i>

932
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:49,750
I thought, "Well, you know,
this is it, the first one's died."

933
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:52,833
<i>He looked pretty blue.</i>

934
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,291
<i>Very cold and lifeless.</i>

935
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:59,208
<i>And I actually couldn't convince myself
that he was breathing.</i>

936
01:25:00,875 --> 01:25:02,708
I was about to start mouth to mouth,

937
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:05,666
<i>but just before I did
I gave his jaw a real hard push</i>

938
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:09,083
to open his airway a bit, and he actually
started breathing with that.

939
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,208
<i>But I still was really worried.</i>

940
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:14,875
I still couldn't conceive
that this child would make it.

941
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:22,458
<i>He was like that the whole way,
between two-and-a-half and three hours.</i>

942
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:27,291
Just for my own sanity,
I would roll him over

943
01:25:27,375 --> 01:25:28,791
so I could look into his face.

944
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,750
<i>He looked asleep.</i>

945
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:33,791
<i>Except he happened to be underwater.</i>

946
01:25:38,708 --> 01:25:40,291
<i>The moment you surface,</i>

947
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:43,458
<i>a fantastic sense
of elation and achievement.</i>

948
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,708
There was a sense
of disbelief that this technique worked.

949
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:11,125
Four of the young soccer players
trapped in that cave in Thailand are out.

950
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,750
<i>So, eight boys
and their coach remain trapped,</i>

951
01:26:14,833 --> 01:26:19,041
<i>their lives still hanging in the balance.
This isn't over.</i>

952
01:26:19,291 --> 01:26:22,333
We'd just pulled off something we thought
was unbelievable and incredible.

953
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,916
Let's do it twice more.

954
01:26:35,666 --> 01:26:37,333
<i>The breaking news is out of Thailand...</i>

955
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:40,083
A boy was seen transported on stretcher...

956
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,767
<i>The fifth boy to be rescued...</i>

957
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:44,125
<i>One boy was taken from the cave
this morning...</i>

958
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:47,750
<i>That right there is an ambulance
we believe to be carrying that sixth boy.</i>

959
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:51,083
<i>This operation is being executed
extremely smoothly.</i>

960
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,458
<i>And that appears
to be the seventh right there.</i>

961
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,250
<i>The boys are coming out.</i>

962
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:58,416
It's not the seventh child,
it is the eighth child.

963
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:00,791
<i>Wild Boar eight out.</i>

964
01:27:00,916 --> 01:27:03,375
<i>One more day on the weather.
The last several days,</i>

965
01:27:03,458 --> 01:27:04,916
<i>they've had enormous luck.</i>

966
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:07,625
<i>These monsoon rains
seem to have held off.</i>

967
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:12,875
But the forecast we kept getting
were it's gonna rain imminently.

968
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:16,083
<i>And it did.</i>

969
01:27:19,208 --> 01:27:20,541
<i>It lashed it down.</i>

970
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:22,750
It never stopped.

971
01:27:22,958 --> 01:27:26,208
These rains will flood
the caves very quickly.

972
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:30,916
<i>We spent the night listening to the rain.</i>

973
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:33,458
<i>It was really, really hammering down,</i>

974
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,458
wondering what was gonna happen
in the cave.

975
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:43,291
<i>It's the only time
I've ever seen Rick and John look anxious,</i>

976
01:27:43,583 --> 01:27:46,208
<i>which was actually starting
to unsettle Craig and me.</i>

977
01:27:56,333 --> 01:27:57,573
<i>We got up in the morning</i>

978
01:27:57,625 --> 01:28:00,166
<i>and the whole place
was just awash with water.</i>

979
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:04,708
<i>We worried that the dams
that diverted the water</i>

980
01:28:04,791 --> 01:28:06,083
<i>would be drenched.</i>

981
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,458
They couldn't hold off forever.

982
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,000
<i>The water diversion will not last.</i>

983
01:28:12,875 --> 01:28:14,333
That's gonna destroy everything.

984
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:20,958
And then when we got
to our predive briefing in the morning,

985
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:22,721
and some of the guys were saying,
you know,

986
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:26,375
"Should we be going into the cave?
Should we be risking our lives?"

987
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:28,309
<i>And then there were those of us
that were saying,</i>

988
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:29,625
<i>"What if we didn't go in today,</i>

989
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:32,875
"and then tomorrow,
there was no more opportunity?"

990
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,833
<i>And I felt like
I had to shut that down really quickly.</i>

991
01:28:36,458 --> 01:28:38,666
<i>We just got up and walked
straight to the cave</i>

992
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:42,541
<i>and everybody else followed.
So, that was the decision made.</i>

993
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,833
So, we realized we were going to attempt
five people on the last day.

994
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,708
<i>Before heading into the cave,
the decision was made</i>

995
01:28:56,791 --> 01:29:01,916
- that I would be the one to bring out...
- the first child that day.

996
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:05,833
<i>As I was swimming,
my mind was on overdrive.</i>

997
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:08,416
<i>"Oh, my God, am I gonna be good enough?</i>

998
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:12,208
<i>"What about the parents
and the friends in the cave?"</i>

999
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:14,166
<i>It's a huge burden.</i>

1000
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:17,750
"If they die, it's gonna tear me apart.
Am I gonna start drinking?"

1001
01:29:18,375 --> 01:29:19,916
You know, "Go off the rails?"

1002
01:29:21,458 --> 01:29:22,833
<i>I was given the coach.</i>

1003
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:28,208
<i>As soon as I was holding him,
I switched to getting the job done.</i>

1004
01:29:36,625 --> 01:29:38,666
<i>Everything was going quite well.</i>

1005
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,500
<i>I remember those last few minutes,</i>

1006
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:46,583
<i>thinking to myself, "I'm nearly there.
What am I gonna do?"</i>

1007
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,708
<i>'Cause I was pretty close
to my threshold.</i>

1008
01:29:49,916 --> 01:29:52,208
"Am I gonna start crying
when I deliver him?"

1009
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:36,125
<i>John arrived after me,
then Rick arrived.</i>

1010
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,708
<i>And Chris was due to come out next.</i>

1011
01:30:39,166 --> 01:30:43,333
I kept waiting and waiting and waiting,
and he just didn't come.

1012
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:49,166
<i>I got all the way back
to the final underwater section,</i>

1013
01:30:49,666 --> 01:30:52,916
<i>the most awkward section.
Got the boy with me at this point,</i>

1014
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:54,666
<i>you know, my precious cargo.</i>

1015
01:30:57,458 --> 01:31:00,333
<i>It's not a normal place
to have a line above you like that.</i>

1016
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:02,601
So, you'd have been on this side,
child in one hand,

1017
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:05,333
line in the other above you.
Quite an awkward position.

1018
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,916
<i>And then something
on that last day changed,</i>

1019
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,125
<i>and we all had problems in that section.</i>

1020
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,708
<i>Just as I was going round
one of the corners,</i>

1021
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:18,083
<i>I needed to transfer the rope
from one hand to another hand.</i>

1022
01:31:18,916 --> 01:31:21,291
But it just pinged away from my hand.

1023
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:28,458
<i>This precious line</i>

1024
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:31,833
<i>that ensures that we're going
to get out the water in one piece,</i>

1025
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:35,416
the thing you never lose,
the thing you never let go of,

1026
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:37,458
I managed to let go of.

1027
01:31:39,833 --> 01:31:42,541
<i>And I didn't know if the boy
might run out of gas.</i>

1028
01:31:54,125 --> 01:31:57,166
<i>It was just myself and Dr. Harris
in the water in Chamber Nine.</i>

1029
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,930
Everybody else had gone out by this point.

1030
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:02,750
<i>I thought the smallest child
had already gone,</i>

1031
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:09,666
<i>but the last kid to walk down the hill
was this boy, Mark, who was 29 kilos.</i>

1032
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:14,625
Mark was by far the most small-faced
petite kid of them all.

1033
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:18,805
<i>We looked to each other and thought,
"That mask isn't gonna fit him.</i>

1034
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:22,078
"We can't leave him here today
and come back tomorrow,

1035
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:24,406
"'cause I don't think
there's gonna be a chance tomorrow."

1036
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,916
<i>We tried the mask.</i>

1037
01:32:28,625 --> 01:32:32,208
<i>We tried packing stuff around it,
like putting the hood under it.</i>

1038
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,750
Try and tighten it up
as tight as possible,

1039
01:32:35,833 --> 01:32:38,500
so we were literally
crushing the kid's nose.

1040
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:41,250
<i>But there was no way
it was gonna keep water out.</i>

1041
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:45,833
<i>For some reason, we'd brought
this more leisure-type,</i>

1042
01:32:45,916 --> 01:32:47,291
<i>full-faced mask too.</i>

1043
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:50,875
<i>Compared to the other ones,
it looked like a little pink toy.</i>

1044
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,541
<i>And when we tried cranking the straps
down on this leisure mask,</i>

1045
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:55,791
the seal collapsed.

1046
01:32:56,791 --> 01:32:58,291
<i>And then water entered.</i>

1047
01:32:59,583 --> 01:33:02,958
So we backed it off, tried it again,
then it collapsed again.

1048
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:06,375
<i>It just sat on his face, and you knew
that if it took a sideways knock,</i>

1049
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:07,833
<i>that would have been curtains.</i>

1050
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:14,166
Jason, I could see
was very unhappy about it.

1051
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,916
<i>The very last child and I was thinking,</i>

1052
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,166
"Poor Jason," you know? "The last kid
is gonna be the one to drown,"

1053
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:25,833
"and Jason's gonna have
to deal with that."

1054
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:30,375
<i>I had to go so slowly, so carefully.</i>

1055
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,750
<i>We were waiting and waiting</i>

1056
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:43,250
and Chris didn't come,
so that was quite anxious.

1057
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:51,000
<i>Despite sweeping around
in the water to try and find this rope,</i>

1058
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:55,708
<i>I couldn't find it.
I kept finding electrical cable.</i>

1059
01:33:58,125 --> 01:34:00,791
<i>That electrical cable
probably goes back to Chamber Three.</i>

1060
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:03,416
<i>So, I started following it.</i>

1061
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:10,666
<i>After, I guess, what was ten minutes,
I popped up into a chamber.</i>

1062
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,833
<i>I was confused.</i>

1063
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,333
<i>I was expecting to surface
in Chamber Three,</i>

1064
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:22,500
<i>where the rescue workers were.
I surfaced in a chamber that was empty.</i>

1065
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:24,041
Hello!

1066
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:27,000
Hello!

1067
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:29,291
Hello!

1068
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:37,875
<i>If I've managed to find
an unknown chamber,</i>

1069
01:34:37,958 --> 01:34:39,500
<i>completely off the main route,</i>

1070
01:34:40,083 --> 01:34:41,625
<i>nobody's gonna come and find us.</i>

1071
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:54,875
<i>I surfaced in the last air chamber
with the child,</i>

1072
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
<i>and immediately in front of me,
there was this apparition of Chris,</i>

1073
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,625
<i>and there was a child at his feet.</i>

1074
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,916
<i>And my immediate thought was,
"We've lost one of them."</i>

1075
01:35:02,250 --> 01:35:06,875
When I saw Jason,
I realized I'd gone backwards in the cave.

1076
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:08,666
I realized I was back in Chamber Four.

1077
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:14,208
<i>Jason headed into the final section,
and then Harry appeared.</i>

1078
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:19,125
I said, "Look, mate,
you just stay here, gather your thoughts,

1079
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:22,208
"I'll take the kid out in the last bit.
You come through when you're ready."

1080
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:30,001
<i>When I hear the humming
of the pump, I knew</i>

1081
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,916
<i>I'm nearly at Chamber Three.
Just before I handed the kid over,</i>

1082
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,708
I got a lump in my throat,
'cause I knew he was gonna be out alive.

1083
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:40,541
Okay, three, two, one.

1084
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,041
<i>When we heard Harry
was bringing Chris's boy forward,</i>

1085
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:49,333
<i>I was confident in Harry</i>

1086
01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:52,166
and pleased for him as well,
that he was able to experience that.

1087
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:57,208
<i>There was these big guys
from the U.S. Air Force there,</i>

1088
01:35:57,541 --> 01:35:58,958
grabbing the kid off you.

1089
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:02,666
<i>Whisking him into a stretcher
and off up the hill.</i>

1090
01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:04,250
<i>And then he's just gone.</i>

1091
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:11,125
Suddenly, the mood was just amazing.

1092
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:15,000
<i>Passing around a bottle of Jack Daniels...</i>

1093
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,666
<i>that wasn't really allowed.</i>

1094
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,438
<i>Bloody done this, I can't believe it.</i>

1095
01:36:23,125 --> 01:36:26,750
I knew the Thai Navy guys
and Dr. Bhak still had to come out

1096
01:36:26,833 --> 01:36:30,333
and we were still worried about them.
I mean, they still had a challenging dive.

1097
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:34,375
<i>And suddenly there's this cry
of something's going wrong.</i>

1098
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:37,666
One of the main pumps
in Chamber Three burst

1099
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:40,041
and just started spewing water everywhere.

1100
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:44,708
<i>Oh, my God, it's rising really fast.</i>

1101
01:36:44,791 --> 01:36:47,291
And we've got no regulators,
we need to get out of here.

1102
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:51,041
<i>We were waiting
on just two more SEALs</i>

1103
01:36:51,125 --> 01:36:53,583
<i>and as that water started to crash,</i>

1104
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:56,791
<i>- those SEALs came out.
- Then the whole chamber flooded.</i>

1105
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,500
We just barely got out
by holding our breath.

1106
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:04,750
<i>We were saying that this must be
what the lady of the cave said,</i>

1107
01:37:04,833 --> 01:37:08,416
"Now, you guys got what you wanted,
and now it's time to go."

1108
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:12,416
Thank you!

1109
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:15,666
<i>And then the SEALs were coming out
right at the end.</i>

1110
01:37:40,750 --> 01:37:42,601
<i>Even though we were the sort of spearhead</i>

1111
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:43,666
<i>to this operation,</i>

1112
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:46,791
there were 100s and 100s of people
in that cave.

1113
01:38:16,041 --> 01:38:17,976
<i>It seems
that the lady opposite me</i>

1114
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,208
<i>was Titan's mother...</i>

1115
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,958
<i>the youngest boy
that I'd brought out on that last day.</i>

1116
01:38:25,458 --> 01:38:28,541
<i>Titan's mom said,
"On behalf of all the parents,</i>

1117
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:31,041
<i>"we wanna thank you
for what you've done.</i>

1118
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:34,625
<i>"It's like our children had died
and been given another life. And...</i>

1119
01:38:36,125 --> 01:38:39,625
"you know, can't thank you enough."

1120
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:53,500
That's what brought home
what we'd done.

1121
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:56,000
<i>They had a family life and parents.</i>

1122
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:07,875
Don't forget it.
Thailand is your second home.

1123
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:13,458
<i>This amazing sense of relief
and euphoria and elation.</i>

1124
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:16,208
I'd had my usual text message, saying...

1125
01:39:17,375 --> 01:39:20,000
"I'm out, I'll ring you
when I get back to the hotel."

1126
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,500
<i>So, he finally rang.</i>

1127
01:39:27,291 --> 01:39:29,500
And I'm just babbling, I'm just, you know,

1128
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:33,000
completely pumped full of adrenalin
at this point.

1129
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:35,791
And I must have gone on
for ten minutes or something, at least,

1130
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:42,000
and finally, I sort of draw a breath
and then suddenly, she's burst into tears.

1131
01:39:47,125 --> 01:39:51,333
And yeah, she tells my dad's just died,
literally a couple of hours ago.

1132
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,125
So, I didn't know what to feel. You know,
it was this huge swing of emotions,

1133
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,208
from being up here, to suddenly,

1134
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:05,791
What... "How has this possibly
happened today, you know, of all days?"

1135
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:13,458
<i>Everyone was very sympathetic
and they all assumed</i>

1136
01:40:13,541 --> 01:40:16,250
<i>that I'd wanna go straight home,
which I thought about.</i>

1137
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:20,916
<i>But then I thought,
"That's actually not gonna help me."</i>

1138
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,833
<i>And even by the end of that first day,</i>

1139
01:40:22,916 --> 01:40:25,291
<i>I was already sort
of feeling better about it all,</i>

1140
01:40:25,458 --> 01:40:30,583
because Dad had a fantastic life,
and you know, he just died, like that.

1141
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:36,250
And I thought, "Well,
you couldn't ask for a better exit."

1142
01:40:38,166 --> 01:40:41,000
<i>And so I sort of started
to see the positive side of it</i>

1143
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:44,416
<i>and started to think,
"Well, this is actually another cause</i>

1144
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,625
<i>"for celebration."</i>

1145
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:49,875
You know, I was celebrating the kids,
but also my dad.

1146
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:59,333
Thank you so much.

1147
01:41:05,708 --> 01:41:07,958
<i>Miracle piled upon miracle.</i>

1148
01:41:40,708 --> 01:41:42,748
We'll see them. Sometime in the future.

1149
01:41:43,166 --> 01:41:46,458
Well, I think I hold a sort of great pride
in what...

1150
01:41:47,458 --> 01:41:48,583
what we did.

1151
01:41:49,083 --> 01:41:54,583
You could say justification
for the dedication I put forward

1152
01:41:54,958 --> 01:42:00,666
into a ridiculous minority sport
that no one ever took seriously.

1153
01:42:00,791 --> 01:42:02,791
Yes, it's definitely changed my life

1154
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:06,083
and made me into
maybe a more confident person.

1155
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:09,875
Last to be chosen for the cricket team,
first to be chosen for the cave rescue.

1156
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:13,875
I did used to worry,
"Was I a bit too cold?

1157
01:42:14,083 --> 01:42:15,541
"Was I a bit too unemotional?"

1158
01:42:16,041 --> 01:42:19,625
I found a use and a purpose
to that level of detachment.

1159
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,041
You can use it to do good things.

1160
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,500
The Wild Boars.

1161
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:09,125
He said, "You need to marry Amp."

1162
01:43:48,375 --> 01:43:51,083
<i>They said it can't be done</i>

1163
01:43:53,875 --> 01:43:57,916
<i>That this one's a challenge
You won't overcome</i>

1164
01:44:02,083 --> 01:44:05,583
<i>I know your dreams are bold</i>

1165
01:44:07,625 --> 01:44:11,750
<i>Keep going, you'll find that you're not
On your own</i>

1166
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:22,333
<i>So don't give up</i>

1167
01:44:23,208 --> 01:44:29,458
<i>And don't give in</i>

1168
01:44:29,875 --> 01:44:36,208
<i>You've gotta believe, believe, believe
That anything is possible</i>

1169
01:44:36,791 --> 01:44:43,000
<i>You've gotta believe, believe, believe
That anything is possible</i>

1170
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:50,458
<i>You gotta keep on and see it through
No matter how hard that is to do</i>

1171
