3
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,916
Been doin'
some readin' sugar plum.

4
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:30,919
My boy got ahold of your private
electronic correspondence.

5
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,989
Mm, slanderous stuff.

6
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:37,626
All pointin' fingers
and wild accusations.

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,863
The last confined
gasps of a little girl

8
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:44,901
who could not cope with failure,
with ruination.

9
00:00:46,202 --> 00:00:48,437
Consider this your
invitation to the death march

10
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:51,440
of Gigi Cutler,
Queen of California.

11
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,911
Houston City, Wednesday week.

12
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:56,111
We'll provide the
golden parachute.

13
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:58,648
All you've gotta do is jump.

14
00:00:59,882 --> 00:01:04,553
Between you and me, I'm just
plain tickled to see it.

15
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:05,187
Bye bye now.

16
00:01:20,035 --> 00:01:22,538
Is that Gigi Cutler?

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,875
Yep.

18
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,710
- Lookie here.
- Who do we have?

19
00:01:28,743 --> 00:01:31,915
Just walked
up,.

20
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:33,750
Shore Oil and Gas,
how can I help you?

21
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,052
Oh.

22
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:51,934
Lookie here at this
piece of shit like you.

23
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:14,056
Gigi, lovin' the tie.

24
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:18,261
He had to tie it on in Texas.

25
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:20,929
Aw, honey you got some smut,

26
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:24,267
you got a little
spunk there on you.

27
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,905
Consider yourself
lucky it's just tuna.

28
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,607
Folks around here get fiery.

29
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,942
Not 300 miles away
is where what's

30
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:36,012
his face got shot in the melon.

31
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:37,913
Who is that?

32
00:02:37,947 --> 00:02:38,782
JFK.

33
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:43,052
Culled like a veal calf for
his premature ambitions.

34
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:46,022
I'll say this much for
LBJ, that swingin' dick

35
00:02:46,054 --> 00:02:49,124
could not abide whipper
snappers.

36
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:52,095
Now you've been gunnin'
after my gig, Gigi.

37
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:54,064
You mighta had it, too.

38
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:59,101
Risin' star, young
blood, lady parts.

39
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,770
Whipper snapper.

40
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:02,805
Lucky then the
board's gonna save

41
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:05,041
me the trouble of pullin' an LBJ

42
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:07,743
and havin' to pop a
bullet in your brain pan.

43
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,077
Gentlemen?

44
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,947
Enjoy your last ride
through Dallas, baby.

45
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,150
Won't be in a convertible.

46
00:03:14,183 --> 00:03:17,721
Now Gigi, I believe
you know the boys.

47
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:19,823
Gentlemen.

48
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:23,293
Miss Cutler, we are
gathered here today

49
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:27,130
to ascertain how you
came to lose so much

50
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:30,700
so quickly that we
may, God willing,

51
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,968
avoid such losses in the future.

52
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:34,036
Testify.

53
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,806
Our losses were well within,

54
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,876
- well within the parameters...
- Shut up!

55
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,745
Just shut the hell up!

56
00:03:43,044 --> 00:03:43,946
Now, I don't know where the hell

57
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,648
you think you are but
this is Houston City,

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,183
this is win town, baby!

59
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:51,921
I got a skyscraper full of
victorious sons of bitches,

60
00:03:51,953 --> 00:03:54,256
damn world conquerors and
they're wanderin' around

61
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,159
like their peckers
have been cut off

62
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:59,595
because mama didn't
bring home the W.

63
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,166
Now, no excuses, G.

64
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,901
What the Devil went
wrong out west?

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,655
Gentlemen, I have come to
find the Devil has a name.

66
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:29,692
God damn it, Fred!

67
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:32,761
You're growin'
Elms, you're in Eden.

68
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,364
Almonds, you're east.

69
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:38,067
Central California to be exact.

70
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,068
I said four!

71
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:41,770
You did not!

72
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:43,373
Four!

73
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,678
There are 53 different
types of nuts in the world.

74
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,879
Fred!

75
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:51,179
- Son of a bitch!
- He was on of 'em.

76
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:55,017
Hey, is that any way
to speak to a neighbor?

77
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,918
You wanna know somethin'?

78
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:59,322
You were never this mean
when Nancy was alive.

79
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:00,756
What the hell

80
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:01,224
did you just say?

81
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:02,992
Hey, Wally.

82
00:05:03,024 --> 00:05:04,094
How's it goin'?

83
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,136
Make him see some damn sense.

84
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,940
Where you goin', neighbor?

85
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,249
In the immortal words
of our illustrious leader,

86
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:28,084
"Who knows the true meaning

87
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,085
"of?"

88
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:33,889
Miss Cutler,

89
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:36,259
had you met the
bastard previously?

90
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,794
The year
before it all started,

91
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,229
at a fundraiser for
our local government.

92
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,231
The Congressman thanks you.

93
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:45,134
The
Congressman owes me.

94
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:00,082
Gigi Cutler?

95
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:00,916
You are?

96
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,918
Your neighbor.

97
00:06:02,952 --> 00:06:05,988
Frederick Stern at my birth
and Fred to my colleagues

98
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,290
and Freddy if it's personal,

99
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,325
so you can call me Fred.

100
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,095
Charmed.

101
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:14,130
Are you enjoyin' this?

102
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:18,267
Mm, all these fat cats and
big wigs lookin' your way,

103
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,937
prayin' to get a
smile from Shore Oil's

104
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:23,371
newly appointed representative.

105
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,173
Do I detect a
hint of hostility?

106
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:26,209
No, hell no.

107
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,111
Just plain curiosity.

108
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:31,514
Hm.

109
00:06:31,546 --> 00:06:33,183
Freddy.

110
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:38,221
That'd be herself
wantin' another spin.

111
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,058
Well, it's been a
hoot with you, G.

112
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:45,127
Shall we my dear?

113
00:06:46,962 --> 00:06:48,331
- Hi, Nancy.
- Nice to see you, Sadie.

114
00:06:48,363 --> 00:06:49,798
Freddy.

115
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:54,303
Still keepin'
it goin', huh, Santi?

116
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:58,407
Someone has to,
you're always in your cave.

117
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,279
How do you say
impertinent prick in Spanish?

118
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,350
Nice try.

119
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:10,286
You've been workin'
for me for, what?

120
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,454
With you.

121
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:14,823
- For me for what, 25 years?
- 30.

122
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:16,091
You gotta have enough saved up

123
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:18,394
by now to get a
patch of your own.

124
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,428
Hell, you could probably
buy a piece of mine.

125
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:21,998
You lookin' to sell?

126
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:25,168
Are you makin' me an offer?

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,101
For this?

128
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,036
Hell no.

129
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,373
- Ours was a brief exchange.
- What the hell?

130
00:07:31,406 --> 00:07:32,942
But you could
see it in his eyes,

131
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:36,044
- And I say what the hell?
- plain as day.

132
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,447
The hunger, the greed.

133
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,881
Men like that spend their

134
00:07:39,914 --> 00:07:42,184
whole lives searchin'
for that easy money.

135
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:45,587
I wouldn't
touch it without gloves.

136
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,390
The Devil
didn't realize it yet,

137
00:07:48,423 --> 00:07:51,459
but he'd finally
found his in us.

138
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:06,508
After you
discovered the pollution,

139
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,276
how did you proceed?

140
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,545
With someone desperate,

141
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:11,313
someone ambitious,
morally malleable.

142
00:08:11,346 --> 00:08:14,049
Farm boy turned
advertising hack.

143
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,150
Alex Gardner.

144
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,252
Sansei Aqua.

145
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:21,389
Pure as the pond, fresh
as the sushi within.

146
00:08:21,423 --> 00:08:22,257
Pardon?

147
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,862
No, this is just part
of my creative process.

148
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:28,296
I had this perspective
client, Sansei Aqua,

149
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:30,399
top ranked Japanese themed
vitamin water brand.

150
00:08:30,432 --> 00:08:33,302
Hey, should I be
wearin' one of those.

151
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,302
Yep.

152
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:36,104
What?

153
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:39,007
You know what this is, Alex?

154
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,642
For every gallon
of crude oil sucked

155
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,879
from this Earth
comes 15 gallons of?

156
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:45,849
Water.

157
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:50,920
No good to any living thing.

158
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,154
What's wrong with it?

159
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,389
Besides the fact
that it's radioactive?

160
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,258
You're joking.

161
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,493
Is cancer a joke?

162
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:00,430
What's it doin' here?

163
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,632
Evaporating, percolating,

164
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:06,469
and it travels.

165
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:19,347
Want some water?

166
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,584
It'll rot your pipes.

167
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:25,353
I know what I'm gonna
be doing tomorrow.

168
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:26,488
Listen to this.

169
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,556
"My daughter Ivanka,

170
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:31,560
"will be on "Fox &
Friends" tomorrow morning.

171
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:32,395
"Enjoy."

172
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:35,330
I will.

173
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:36,266
She's cute.

174
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:38,935
How are the trees?

175
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:40,336
We're gonna need some help.

176
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,204
Are you in the market?

177
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:44,507
You think I'd be sitting here

178
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,376
with you if I could
afford a boat?

179
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:49,411
So you're browsing?

180
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,347
- Hm.
- Browsing.

181
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,556
What are you doin' Santi?

182
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,660
What the hell are you doin'?

183
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,496
What?

184
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:08,463
What?

185
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:12,267
Why are you takin' a
picture of Nancy's...

186
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:16,438
It's
been a year, Fred.

187
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,177
Santi, Santi, I'm
sorry, I didn't...

188
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:32,421
You're
too heavy!

189
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:34,690
If I fall, I fall on you.

190
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:38,560
Communist bastard!

191
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:40,430
I'm not a communist!

192
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,532
I'm an anarchist.

193
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,535
Nobody knows the difference.

194
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:48,371
You got your finger in my eye!

195
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:50,472
Well you got your
finger in my nose.

196
00:10:51,573 --> 00:10:53,576
Get your finger outta my nose.

197
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,195
I'm too old for this.

198
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:14,130
Are you kiddin'?

199
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:16,164
My ass so God damn heavy.

200
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:25,340
Okay.

201
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,377
Tomorrow.

202
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,679
- Okay.
- Get outta here.

203
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:32,080
Okay.

204
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:41,457
You're outta beer.

205
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,624
Out.

206
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:31,507
All right.

207
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,213
You shoot him?

208
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:38,547
I shot it, I killed
it, I dressed it

209
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,549
and I put it on my wall.

210
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:42,784
Kinda kidding, I
thought that was a prop.

211
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:47,623
Now, I buy your ad and you
buy Fred Stern's property.

212
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,698
It is a win win.

213
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,565
Why me?

214
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,603
Alex, what I am
offering you is big.

215
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:03,238
Its now.

216
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:08,544
It is Royal Shore Oil.

217
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,714
I mean, look around, huh?

218
00:13:13,748 --> 00:13:17,286
And Stern, well, he's
salt of the earth.

219
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,656
He's a farmer.

220
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,791
He's never gonna
trust my lawyers,

221
00:13:22,824 --> 00:13:24,526
but an old friend?

222
00:13:27,762 --> 00:13:29,865
And we'll be fair to him.

223
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:32,868
No you won't.

224
00:13:50,752 --> 00:13:53,189
What do you got there?

225
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:59,262
Pretty close, huh?

226
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:03,565
Where the hell
did you get this?

227
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,733
EBay.

228
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:06,667
Alec Gardner.

229
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:09,237
Saw him in town, he
wants to buy you dinner.

230
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:09,839
Us dinner.

231
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:11,607
Dinner?

232
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,675
Yeah, sure.

233
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,709
When?

234
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,711
Tonight or I
can reschedule it,

235
00:14:16,744 --> 00:14:17,779
but it's a free dinner.

236
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,449
No, tonight's, tonight's...

237
00:14:21,315 --> 00:14:22,817
Alex was always...

238
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:25,720
Yeah.

239
00:14:25,753 --> 00:14:27,623
Okay, I'll pick
you up around six.

240
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:28,791
Yeah, that's fine.

241
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,626
That's fine.

242
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:31,793
Sure, but Santi?

243
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:38,666
I'll see you at six.

244
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,735
I just said that.

245
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:44,206
Yeah, well, that's
why I heard it then.

246
00:14:51,012 --> 00:14:53,648
Well, well, well.

247
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,717
Santi, baby, hey.

248
00:14:55,751 --> 00:14:56,852
- Oh, a hug.
- Fred, what are

249
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,319
you feedin' this big boy?

250
00:14:58,353 --> 00:14:59,488
- It's nice to see
- Fantastic.

251
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:02,525
- you again, Sir.
- Good to see you back.

252
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:05,460
Honey...

253
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:07,997
Fred, Santi.

254
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,332
Thank you, Maggie.

255
00:15:10,364 --> 00:15:13,768
This was 70 years
in the making, okay?

256
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:15,370
A family business.

257
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:17,338
Stern was never gonna sell.

258
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:19,575
So, I threw him a curve.

259
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:21,743
Fred, you know Gigi Cutler?

260
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,711
Sure, she seems
like a smart lady.

261
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:25,680
She is a big fan of yours,

262
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:27,583
and she actually just
gave me the inside track

263
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,018
on some offers they're gonna

264
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,853
be makin' to
farmers around here.

265
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:32,954
I asked her if I
could sound you out.

266
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,556
Well, what would
the great Shore Oil

267
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:36,825
want with the Stern's?

268
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,993
They want your pore space.

269
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:39,961
Our what?

270
00:15:39,994 --> 00:15:42,464
Your pore space.

271
00:15:42,497 --> 00:15:43,998
What's that?

272
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:44,867
May I?

273
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:50,539
Pancakes, that's your land.

274
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:53,809
And this strawberry syrup,

275
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,812
that's the ground water
runnin' beneath your land.

276
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:59,915
Now, as you know ground water
'round here's lousy with salt.

277
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:01,784
Totally useless for irrigation,

278
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,084
just like this berry
flavored bullshit

279
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:06,488
ain't fit for human consumption.

280
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:10,425
This ground water,
that's gonna soak up

281
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,627
into the lower
layers of the dirt,

282
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,699
but the surface, the surface
is gonna remain dry, tasteless.

283
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:20,502
That's why you and
everybody else around here,

284
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,038
you gotta pipe in
the pure stuff.

285
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,776
That doesn't exactly
answer my question.

286
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,913
What do we have here?

287
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:36,017
You see that?

288
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,951
See this right here?

289
00:16:36,984 --> 00:16:38,387
Those air holes that's lettin'

290
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,122
the syrup soak in
there good and bad?

291
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,725
That's your pore space.

292
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:46,996
And that fellas, that is
what Shore Oil wants to buy.

293
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:52,335
I was buyin' a air,
space, nothing, everything.

294
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,436
What this?

295
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:56,872
These air holes?

296
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,607
Why?

297
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,811
Because they wanna get to the
strawberry syrup down there.

298
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,479
That salty ass ground water,

299
00:17:04,512 --> 00:17:08,616
it turns out is an easy
base for hydraulic fluid.

300
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,454
They're tellin' me 50,000 for
the whole kit and caboodle.

301
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:13,121
$50,000?

302
00:17:15,957 --> 00:17:18,728
Why do you think I called ya?

303
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:20,896
I want 70.

304
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,031
- Fred...
- No.

305
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,734
70 grand and it's yours.

306
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:29,871
I only got a contract for 50.

307
00:17:29,904 --> 00:17:30,805
- Well, I...
- You got

308
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,508
a contract on you for $50,000?

309
00:17:36,978 --> 00:17:39,414
Fred, this is a scam.

310
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:40,149
Now hold on here.

311
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:42,483
Are you callin' me a liar?

312
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:45,853
Listen, quit that country
bumpkin bullshit, Alec.

313
00:17:45,886 --> 00:17:47,623
It's Alex.

314
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:50,825
Well, Alec, why
did you come to us?

315
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:53,962
Fred, you want
$70,000 you better tell

316
00:17:53,995 --> 00:17:56,431
your boy here to take a walk.

317
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:58,132
- Santi, Santi...
- Who you callin'

318
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,801
boy?

319
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:00,701
Santi, just go wait

320
00:18:00,735 --> 00:18:01,969
- in the car.
- No.

321
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,606
- Santi wait in the car.
- No.

322
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:08,810
Wait in the car.

323
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:14,882
Do you need a refill

324
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:15,550
- on your syrup?
- Santi do not do...

325
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:19,455
- Hey.
- Oh, that's just great.

326
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:20,956
Maggie, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,658
I got it Maggie, I got it.

328
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:27,662
- Yeah.
- Santi, Santi, Santi.

329
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:30,498
I should probably go, too.

330
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:31,667
Alex?

331
00:18:38,172 --> 00:18:39,974
Are you playin' me?

332
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,978
How long have we
known each other?

333
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,512
Are you?

334
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:46,648
Fred, it's me, man.

335
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,815
It's Al.

336
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:53,788
Okay.

337
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:56,691
To hell with the
whole damn valley.

338
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:58,227
If Shore wants what I got,

339
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:01,497
$70,000's my minimum,
you understand?

340
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:02,830
Yeah.

341
00:19:02,863 --> 00:19:04,165
Now, I'd like more.

342
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:06,067
Can I get more?

343
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,169
Huh?

344
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,903
I'll do my best.

345
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:12,040
You got another rag?

346
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:14,109
Sure, Fred.

347
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,011
We'll be talkin'.

348
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:18,046
Yeah.

349
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:29,024
I own the space,

350
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:32,227
and the water that
travels through it,

351
00:19:32,259 --> 00:19:35,063
and the poison that lies within.

352
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:49,911
Fred.

353
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,036
It's not just here.

354
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:17,906
Tell me you didn't
sign that deal.

355
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,198
Water.

356
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,767
It's the water.

357
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:55,244
You son of a bitch.

358
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,680
Fred...

359
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:01,148
Hey, come on, come on, Fred.

360
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:02,116
Hold on, Fred.

361
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,154
Fred, oh, come on!

362
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:27,108
- Alex!
- There's someone after me!

363
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:28,776
- Who?
- Did you hear what I said?

364
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:30,044
He's comin' after me!

365
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:31,979
- Who's comin' after you?
- Oh, God!

366
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:32,981
- Fred!
- Hey!

367
00:21:33,014 --> 00:21:34,082
Stern, did he sign?

368
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:36,084
- Come on, Fred.
- Stern, did he sign?

369
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,219
Alex?

370
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:37,952
- Come on Fred!
- Hey!

371
00:21:37,986 --> 00:21:39,720
- Fred, it was all her!
- Alex!

372
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:40,889
- I didn't know!
- Hey, bozo!

373
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,158
God damn it.

374
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:45,661
Fred.

375
00:21:45,693 --> 00:21:48,296
Oh, you yella son of a bitch.

376
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:50,132
Fred,
please, I didn't know.

377
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:51,065
God!

378
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,299
Gigi, I can't go to prison.

379
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,702
- Sure you can.
- Well, Gigi Cutler.

380
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:55,771
Fred, please.

381
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,239
I can't, I'm sorry, Fred.

382
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,180
Lady, you better tell me
what's goin' on right now.

383
00:22:05,212 --> 00:22:06,882
I bit my tongue.

384
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:08,149
Well, that's too bad.

385
00:22:08,182 --> 00:22:09,950
You're gonna need that
where you're goin'.

386
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,186
America's farmers

387
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,154
are killin' themselves
in record numbers.

388
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:14,256
You like where you're goin'?

389
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:15,123
You know what?

390
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,324
I'm gonna find out
what's been goin'

391
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:18,693
on with my water
and when I do...

392
00:22:19,393 --> 00:22:20,395
Hey Stern?

393
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:25,033
How much, right now?

394
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:29,304
Everyone's got a price.

395
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:33,208
Ha!

396
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,075
Well, somethin' tells me we're

397
00:22:34,109 --> 00:22:38,046
gonna be figurin'
that out together.

398
00:22:38,078 --> 00:22:40,114
I'll be seein' ya.

399
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:43,285
I got all the money
in the world, boy!

400
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:55,930
Had the poison not
risen to the surface,

401
00:22:55,963 --> 00:22:58,299
Mr. Stern woulda
signed that deal.

402
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,969
This particular conversation,

403
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,337
is in thanks to my predecessor.

404
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:06,274
You tryin' to pin this on me?

405
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:09,243
Those pits were dug
under your tenure.

406
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:10,511
Miss Cutler, the board's issue

407
00:23:10,545 --> 00:23:12,480
is not with the
pollution itself,

408
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:15,984
but with your failure
to cover it up.

409
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:18,320
Then I shoulda been made
aware of it when I took over.

410
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:19,988
Oh, come on, what?

411
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,355
If you buy a house
you gonna blame

412
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:24,192
the last owner because
it catches fire?

413
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:26,728
Only if the house was yours.

414
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:31,333
Gentlemen, let's get
back to the issue.

415
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:34,503
Stern smelled blood
and so he found

416
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:39,173
a lawyer with an appetite
for fortune equal to his own.

417
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:42,377
The man who killed the Pinto.

418
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:45,279
This bastard killed the Pinto?

419
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:48,783
Dead.

420
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:49,884
Thank you, John.

421
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:50,986
Safe journey.

422
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:55,157
Come in, come in.

423
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,459
Hey, are you Ralph Egis?

424
00:23:57,491 --> 00:24:00,027
Aegis, A-E-G-I-S.

425
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:01,263
You been waiting long?

426
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,265
- Well...
- Sorry about that.

427
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:05,032
You can sit but before we begin,

428
00:24:05,065 --> 00:24:07,134
lemme just say,
I'm not interested

429
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,571
in petty squabbles or
seeking settlements.

430
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:11,139
If you're here for
such I'd be happy

431
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:14,476
to refer you to any of
my esteemed colleagues.

432
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:16,178
Is that a Ford Pinto?

433
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,378
No, Sir.

434
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:20,448
That is the head of the
fiery dragon, Pinto,

435
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,517
which I engaged in mortal
combat in the late '70s.

436
00:24:23,551 --> 00:24:24,920
Huh.

437
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:27,955
Shitty God damn
car, not a great pony.

438
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:29,990
Ask him.

439
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:32,026
He was Ford at the time.

440
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,897
We was slingin' Pinto's
like cocaine cupcakes.

441
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,298
I was pretty hot back then.

442
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:39,133
So was the Pinto, of course.

443
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,436
So hot in fact
that its fuel tank

444
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:43,238
would ignite and
burst into flames

445
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,239
if it got hit in a
rear end collision.

446
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:47,242
Nothin's perfect.

447
00:24:47,275 --> 00:24:48,410
Nothin's for free.

448
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:51,046
Which amounted
to 180 burn deaths

449
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:52,246
a year in the U.S. alone.

450
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,447
- Now...
- Accidents happen,

451
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,882
people die.

452
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:56,317
According to an
internal Ford memo,

453
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:59,187
it would cost the
company $11 per Pinto

454
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:00,555
to fix the problem
with a recall.

455
00:25:00,587 --> 00:25:02,556
But with 12,000,000
of 'em on the road,

456
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,327
that would cost $137,000,000,

457
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,296
compared with $50,000,000
to maintain the status quo.

458
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,299
Nobody wants to
blame their baby boy,

459
00:25:11,332 --> 00:25:14,969
oh, little Miss Suck A Dick
for their own emulation.

460
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,638
They want deniability.

461
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:18,105
Ford did the math.

462
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:21,276
$137,000,000 to solve
a $50,000,000 problem?

463
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:22,209
"No, problem.

464
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,111
"Let 'em burn," and they did.

465
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:27,882
And our Pinto's unique,
cheap and patented design

466
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:29,483
provided the perfect patsy.

467
00:25:29,517 --> 00:25:32,453
Eventually, thank God, a
disgruntled Ford employee blew

468
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,355
the whistle and got
us the internal memo.

469
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:36,992
And then some low life
leaks our book keepers doodles

470
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:38,994
and before you know
it, just like that,

471
00:25:39,026 --> 00:25:41,462
the Pinto falls from grace.

472
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,297
Took Ford to court
in a class action

473
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,666
and I took the Pinto's head.

474
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:46,534
Bad year for business, '78.

475
00:25:46,566 --> 00:25:49,036
Good year for barbecue.

476
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:53,507
What's your name again?

477
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,909
Fred Stern.

478
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:57,244
I think I might have
what you're looking for.

479
00:25:57,277 --> 00:25:59,213
You found me a dragon?

480
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:01,083
The dragon found me.

481
00:26:04,384 --> 00:26:06,153
There are these, too.

482
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,190
Why are you doing this?

483
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,392
They're poisoning my farm.

484
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:12,394
Obviously.

485
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:13,561
And they're trying to buy

486
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,330
me off with a
measly five figures.

487
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:18,299
Could they do it for six?

488
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:19,601
Seven?

489
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:22,237
How much would it
take, Mr. Stern?

490
00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:24,506
See, that's the key question.

491
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,407
And I am left to
wonder if you're here

492
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,476
to slay a dragon or
get paid off by one.

493
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,147
Let me know when you decide.

494
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,282
Hello.

495
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:36,116
Damn it!

496
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,556
Who the hell does
he think he is?

497
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:52,534
Who the hell is this?

498
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,476
Are you Fred Stern?

499
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:03,578
Yeah.

500
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,748
What are you doin' here?

501
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,450
Oh, I wanted to...

502
00:27:10,218 --> 00:27:11,252
I need to...

503
00:27:11,285 --> 00:27:12,521
Need to do what?

504
00:27:14,654 --> 00:27:16,690
I'm sorry, I should go.

505
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:18,726
No, no, wait a second.

506
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,965
Did Gigi Cutler send you?

507
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,568
No.

508
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:32,474
No, but I heard what she did
and I just wanted to help.

509
00:27:34,642 --> 00:27:36,544
You wanna help me?

510
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,478
Yes, Sir.

511
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:39,581
Why?

512
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:42,483
Why would you wanna do that?

513
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:43,719
Gigi's a bitch.

514
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,594
You want a cup of coffee?

515
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:55,329
These are really good, Fred.

516
00:27:56,497 --> 00:27:58,632
Yeah, yeah, my
wife painted 'em.

517
00:27:58,665 --> 00:27:59,566
Oh.

518
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,404
Is she a professional artist?

519
00:28:02,437 --> 00:28:04,606
No, no, she passed away.

520
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,575
I'm sorry, I didn't...

521
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:10,412
That's all right.

522
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:13,614
So, you wanna help me?

523
00:28:13,648 --> 00:28:16,251
Well, why are they all boats?

524
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:20,622
No need to be
nervous, all right?

525
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:23,290
Just, why don't you sit down?

526
00:28:24,325 --> 00:28:25,160
Yeah.

527
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:31,533
So, you got something
on Gigi Cutler, huh?

528
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:32,467
What is it?

529
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:35,769
This about a memo or somethin'?

530
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:38,238
I shouldn't be here.

531
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:39,206
Fred, I should go.

532
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,209
Yeah, yeah, boats, boats.

533
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,078
Yeah, there is a lot
of 'em.

534
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:47,114
You see, they're,
well, when my wife

535
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:49,651
and I were kids she had a dream

536
00:28:49,683 --> 00:28:53,421
that we would sail around
the world together one day.

537
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:54,588
Well, did you?

538
00:28:56,423 --> 00:28:58,793
No, no, we had a farm to run.

539
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:01,429
Work and life.

540
00:29:01,461 --> 00:29:04,598
Life gets in the way
of life.

541
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:08,603
So we didn't but she
painted it, our journey.

542
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:12,739
That one's us leaving
Long Beach Harbor.

543
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:13,741
The one above the mantelpiece

544
00:29:13,774 --> 00:29:15,577
is us sailing into Cape Town,

545
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,213
and the one above your head,

546
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:20,114
that's us gettin'
caught in a storm

547
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:23,852
around in the horn.

548
00:29:25,152 --> 00:29:28,489
She didn't
finish that one.

549
00:29:28,523 --> 00:29:29,424
No, no.

550
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:31,526
She died before she could.

551
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:36,297
That's you and
Nancy comin' home?

552
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,568
Yeah, that's exactly
what is.

553
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:41,436
It's...

554
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:46,640
Yeah, I never told
anyone that before.

555
00:29:46,673 --> 00:29:48,809
And everyday I regret the...

556
00:29:52,246 --> 00:29:53,648
I never told you her name.

557
00:29:56,918 --> 00:29:57,752
Wow.

558
00:29:58,885 --> 00:30:01,555
How filthy you must
feel right now.

559
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,257
Hawkin' your dead wife's memory

560
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,626
for a slim shot at a leg up.

561
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,795
Oh, Freddy.

562
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,163
How the hell did you know...

563
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:10,231
Shh, shh.

564
00:30:10,264 --> 00:30:10,899
Excuse me.

565
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,634
I gotta take this.

566
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:18,473
- I'm here.
- Farmer turn you out?

567
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:21,642
No, I'm
drinkin' his piss poor coffee

568
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:25,713
- in his shit hole of a house.
- All right, make him see.

569
00:30:25,746 --> 00:30:29,184
Yeah,
I'll bring him around.

570
00:30:29,217 --> 00:30:31,319
Who the hell are you?

571
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:32,754
Why don't you just
sit down there, hoss?

572
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:35,289
No, you're leavin'.

573
00:30:35,323 --> 00:30:36,623
I have a message to deliver.

574
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:39,694
You know, you are trespassing.

575
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:41,930
I could kick your
butt and the cops

576
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:43,864
wouldn't even blink an eye.

577
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:47,734
Could you, though?

578
00:30:47,767 --> 00:30:52,274
And even if you do I'm still
gonna keep comin' back.

579
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:57,278
You get the hell outta
my house right now.

580
00:30:58,478 --> 00:30:59,280
Okay.

581
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:03,251
I'll get the hell
outta your house.

582
00:31:04,352 --> 00:31:05,719
The message is this.

583
00:31:05,753 --> 00:31:06,688
You're never gonna
get even close

584
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,390
to what's owed you, so drop it.

585
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:11,226
There's a million
reasons why you should

586
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:12,693
and you're gonna wake
up to every single

587
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:15,662
one of 'em in your
bank account if you do.

588
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:17,799
A million isn't even close?

589
00:31:19,499 --> 00:31:20,767
Oh my.

590
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:21,936
Dumb and put upon.

591
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,671
You are a peach, Freddy.

592
00:31:23,703 --> 00:31:25,572
Oh, God damn it!

593
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,275
I forgot the if not.

594
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:32,814
If you don't drop it, Mr.
Stern, I'm gonna start takin'.

595
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,681
I ain't gonna stop.

596
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:36,785
They don't pay me to stop.

597
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:40,555
I'ma take everything.

598
00:31:40,587 --> 00:31:44,858
I'll take everything you
love, everything you made.

599
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,362
I'ma take it all,

600
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:49,964
if not.

601
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:56,304
- Your chair's on fire.
- Huh?

602
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,475
Damn it!

603
00:32:40,748 --> 00:32:41,949
Whoa!

604
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:45,586
God.

605
00:32:50,357 --> 00:32:51,358
That's nice.

606
00:32:51,392 --> 00:32:52,626
This the Pinto, right?

607
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,628
I like it, good car.

608
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:57,899
No, no.

609
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:00,334
Ralph, thanks for comin' in.

610
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:01,535
- I...
- Is he with you?

611
00:33:01,568 --> 00:33:02,869
- Yeah, he...
- Oh, I was about

612
00:33:02,902 --> 00:33:03,837
to call the cops.

613
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:04,906
I'm sorry, man.

614
00:33:10,443 --> 00:33:11,611
So what did you decide?

615
00:33:11,644 --> 00:33:13,013
A man offered me a
million dollars tonight.

616
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:14,414
Hm.

617
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:15,049
And?

618
00:33:15,082 --> 00:33:15,983
I said no.

619
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,651
Why?

620
00:33:17,684 --> 00:33:19,419
Because they owe me more.

621
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:21,756
They're poisoning
my home and it may

622
00:33:21,788 --> 00:33:24,558
not be much but it was ours
and it was a good home.

623
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:25,860
You can ask Santi.

624
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:27,894
Ralph, they may have
poisoned my wife.

625
00:33:27,928 --> 00:33:29,397
We might not be able to prove it

626
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,734
but they're gonna rob
me of that, of our life,

627
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,768
I'm gonna rob them of theirs.

628
00:33:34,802 --> 00:33:36,003
- Hm.
- You know how much money

629
00:33:36,036 --> 00:33:39,039
they've made poisoning my land?

630
00:33:39,073 --> 00:33:42,910
2.1 billion dollars and
that's just one year.

631
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:44,010
Over 10 years?

632
00:33:44,044 --> 00:33:45,580
- At least.
- Hm.

633
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:48,583
Hm.

634
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,119
Well?

635
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,690
Well, I'd say they
owe you at least a year.

636
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:00,427
Well, are we gonna do this or?

637
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,132
I'd say there's enough room
over there for an oil rig.

638
00:34:04,164 --> 00:34:07,634
This okay with your
anarchist principles?

639
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:12,172
For 2.1 billion,
are you kidding me?

640
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,482
Let's do it then.

641
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:37,998
Two!

642
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:41,035
$2,000,000,000 Olive!

643
00:34:42,002 --> 00:34:44,439
That's two too many
and way too much.

644
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:45,872
Slow your roll.

645
00:34:45,906 --> 00:34:48,743
Let me take a look
at the summons.

646
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:51,779
All right, negligent trespass.

647
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:53,681
Ralph Aegis representing.

648
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:56,817
I mean, it's gonna be tough.

649
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,919
If you can't beat 'em then

650
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,853
I should just call 777.

651
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:01,689
Well, he was big in
the '80s but you know

652
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:04,624
what Sun Tzu said about
underestimating your opponents.

653
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:05,460
What's that?

654
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:06,160
Don't.

655
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:06,826
Drink?

656
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:25,179
Howdy!

657
00:35:26,046 --> 00:35:27,781
Oh, God!

658
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:30,017
Fuck, what is that?

659
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:31,218
What was it?

660
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,721
Clumsy.

661
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:35,922
Who are you?

662
00:35:35,955 --> 00:35:37,924
I'm from Houston.

663
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,960
That's in Texas, Ma'am.

664
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:41,796
Like all my exes.

665
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:45,600
Did corporate send you?

666
00:35:45,632 --> 00:35:46,600
Yep.

667
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:49,003
- I didn't ask for any...
- Help?

668
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,971
Who the hell do
you think you are?

669
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:54,075
I think I'm from
fuckin' Houston.

670
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,178
Oh boy.

671
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,046
Come here.

672
00:35:59,747 --> 00:36:02,517
- Sorry G.
- Come on, come sit down.

673
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:03,850
- Oh, Christ.
- Here you go.

674
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:05,019
- Oh, thank you.
- There's a switch

675
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:07,020
on the front.

676
00:36:07,053 --> 00:36:07,854
Whew.

677
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:11,526
Hey Texas, my net
worth isn't puke.

678
00:36:11,558 --> 00:36:12,160
I know.

679
00:36:13,593 --> 00:36:15,996
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have cursed at a lady.

680
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:19,866
I just, I don't like
to repeat myself.

681
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:21,968
You have to understand, Gigi,
I'm just here here to help.

682
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:26,741
See, if this farmer is
successful with this lawsuit,

683
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:28,942
then he has established
a precedent.

684
00:36:28,975 --> 00:36:31,211
No shit, it's gonna be open
season for all the big boys.

685
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,047
Anyone, anyone
who's ever taken

686
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,748
a piss in a peasants pond.

687
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,082
Oh, I'm not gonna
let it happen.

688
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:37,218
No, me neither.

689
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,020
What are you
gonna do about it?

690
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:44,091
You hear that?

691
00:36:44,123 --> 00:36:45,026
Just listen for a second.

692
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:46,093
Just close your eyes.

693
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:49,564
I'm listenin'.

694
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:54,936
That is the sound of
progress uninterrupted.

695
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:59,139
That is the sound of money
found and fortunes won.

696
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:03,076
That's not just a lawsuit, Gigi.

697
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:04,312
It's a revolution.

698
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:05,879
We lose, we die.

699
00:37:07,013 --> 00:37:08,782
So they send you.

700
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,718
Guys, I'm gonna
,

701
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,953
I'm gonna take a walk.

702
00:37:11,986 --> 00:37:14,288
I'll be over here
if you need me.

703
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:21,127
I'm here to bring
Stern to the table, Gig.

704
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,697
He's not gonna come on his own,

705
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,065
and I'm gonna bring
him to his knees.

706
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:30,671
In the event that
my learned colleague

707
00:37:30,703 --> 00:37:32,839
for the defense
tries to convince you

708
00:37:32,872 --> 00:37:35,175
that this is a
very complex case,

709
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:39,379
kindly permit me to offer a
very, very simple analogy, okay?

710
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:42,950
Let's say for example your
next door neighbor runs

711
00:37:42,982 --> 00:37:47,187
a dog kennel and one day
one of their dogs escapes,

712
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:49,056
and he wanders over
onto your property

713
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:51,625
and he beats right on your lawn.

714
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:53,660
Well, and no offense
to the court,

715
00:37:53,694 --> 00:37:55,228
but shit happens but what would

716
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:57,765
you expect from that neighbor?

717
00:37:57,797 --> 00:37:58,899
Well, bottom line that
they would come over

718
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:01,701
and apologize and clean up
their mess and assure you

719
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:04,337
that this would never
happen again, am I right?

720
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,039
End of story.

721
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:09,377
But now, what if you found out
that for the last 10 years,

722
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,046
that dog and 20
other dogs like it,

723
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:13,781
were in fact
trained to come over

724
00:38:13,814 --> 00:38:17,785
onto your property and dump
tons of canine excrement

725
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:19,120
right on your front porch.

726
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:21,087
What would you expect
from that neighbor now?

727
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,089
Well, you can't
even say can you?

728
00:38:23,122 --> 00:38:23,923
No, of course not.

729
00:38:23,957 --> 00:38:26,160
Because you cannot
possibly imagine

730
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:28,895
such a scenario being true.

731
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:31,364
Well, I'm here to assure
you that it is true,

732
00:38:31,397 --> 00:38:34,134
that it has been happening
for the past 10 years

733
00:38:34,167 --> 00:38:36,671
to my client, Mr. Fred Stern,

734
00:38:36,703 --> 00:38:38,872
that it continues to
happen as we speak

735
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:41,142
and the perpetrator, Shore Oil,

736
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:42,743
knew from the start all about it

737
00:38:42,776 --> 00:38:45,245
and they did absolutely
nothing but profit

738
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:49,884
to the tune of $20,000,000,000
over the last 10 years.

739
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,252
Well, friends, we're
gonna prove our case,

740
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:54,821
and we are gonna extract
$2,000,000,000 from Shore Oil

741
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:56,190
in compensation and
we're gonna use it

742
00:38:56,223 --> 00:38:57,825
to clean up their mess and we're

743
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:00,960
gonna make damn sure that
their irresponsible destruction

744
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:04,265
of the environment for profit
ends with your verdict.

745
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:05,098
Thank you.

746
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:06,166
Your honor, may I
approach the bench?

747
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,468
Yes.

748
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,736
I have to go to the
toilet very badly.

749
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,771
Go.

750
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:11,838
Thank you, thank you.

751
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,007
God.

752
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,109
Fred, listen, I'm
gonna go to the toilet.

753
00:39:15,142 --> 00:39:16,176
Take notes on
everything she says.

754
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,878
- I'll be right back.
- What?

755
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,712
Miss Gore.

756
00:39:27,453 --> 00:39:30,091
Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

757
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:32,225
that dog just don't hunt.

758
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,299
Now, Shore Oil has always been
environmentally responsible.

759
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:41,035
That's not what this
is about though, is it?

760
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:44,471
This, this is Fred
Stern's personal crusade

761
00:39:47,306 --> 00:39:51,145
to gain wealth and to
push his leftist agenda.

762
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:53,913
We've all seen the news.

763
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:56,783
We've all seen the deterioration

764
00:39:56,817 --> 00:39:59,920
of the great industries
of this country.

765
00:39:59,953 --> 00:40:02,022
Jobs fleeing to China,

766
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:06,227
while more and more
jobless immigrants pour in,

767
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:09,229
taking what little we've got.

768
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,464
Fred Stern doesn't
see it this way.

769
00:40:10,497 --> 00:40:15,802
No, he sees this as a move in
the right, the left direction.

770
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,310
What was your strategy
as the case moved forward?

771
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:27,013
It was nut cuttin' time.

772
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:28,482
Starve Stern out in court,

773
00:40:28,515 --> 00:40:30,183
smother him in
political diatribe

774
00:40:30,216 --> 00:40:34,287
while your man forced the
issue from the outside.

775
00:40:34,321 --> 00:40:37,056
A little help from Alex Gardner.

776
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,399
Gigi, confession.

777
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:47,234
Take one.

778
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:48,301
Gigi confession, take...

779
00:41:27,073 --> 00:41:28,508
- Alexander.
- I didn't mean to,

780
00:41:28,542 --> 00:41:30,411
- I didn't mean to...
- Alexander James...

781
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:31,579
- It just went off!
- Shut your fuckin'

782
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:33,113
whimperin' boy!

783
00:41:35,348 --> 00:41:38,484
Failed actor, disgraced ad man,

784
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:41,388
turned into a cold
blooded killer.

785
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,022
Who knew you had such balls.

786
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:48,895
I didn't mean to hurt
anybody, I just want...

787
00:41:49,562 --> 00:41:51,331
Oo.

788
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:53,399
I just wanted my job back.

789
00:41:53,433 --> 00:41:56,070
I was just.

790
00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:56,903
No, no.

791
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:01,875
I just wanted...

792
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,578
You wanted redemption.

793
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,982
Hm.

794
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:10,852
Oh wow.

795
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:13,353
Oh, you poor boy.

796
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:16,356
Broken.

797
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:20,460
It's gonna be all right.

798
00:42:20,493 --> 00:42:22,428
- Yeah.
- You gonna tell her?

799
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:23,430
Mm mm.

800
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:24,564
Not me.

801
00:42:24,598 --> 00:42:25,433
Not her.

802
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,935
You're not?

803
00:42:27,968 --> 00:42:29,069
What the fuck did I
just say to you, boy?

804
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:31,906
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh, shh.

805
00:42:56,462 --> 00:42:58,031
What are you doin'?

806
00:42:58,064 --> 00:43:00,300
Same thing as you.

807
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:01,435
Killing Gigi.

808
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:04,238
But why?

809
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:06,940
Why?

810
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,513
Big Boss sent me.

811
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:14,382
Ruination.

812
00:43:18,384 --> 00:43:20,353
What do you think this
whole case is for, huh?

813
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:22,221
Why do you think that
farmer's askin' for billions?

814
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:24,257
'Cause I made it so.

815
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,125
Me.

816
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,110
No.

817
00:43:49,515 --> 00:43:51,084
Say you came to kill her.

818
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:53,520
Say it.

819
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:56,422
I came here to kill Gigi.

820
00:43:56,455 --> 00:43:57,658
That's right.

821
00:44:00,593 --> 00:44:01,962
That is right.

822
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,634
You are way more than
they think you are, Alex.

823
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:08,469
You are.

824
00:44:13,205 --> 00:44:14,040
We are.

825
00:44:29,388 --> 00:44:31,424
I'm gonna build somethin' here.

826
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:32,692
Me.

827
00:44:32,725 --> 00:44:35,528
I want you buy my side,
but I need to know

828
00:44:35,562 --> 00:44:37,598
that I can trust you, Alex,

829
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:41,569
with even my deepest
darkest secrets.

830
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:43,804
Darkest secrets.

831
00:44:43,837 --> 00:44:44,672
So...

832
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,511
What do you say, boy?

833
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:19,607
What?

834
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,578
Okay, we'll give most
of it away to charity.

835
00:45:24,611 --> 00:45:25,446
You happy?

836
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,849
It's a noble plan, comrade.

837
00:45:29,882 --> 00:45:31,218
Don't call me that.

838
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,386
Why not?

839
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:35,589
You rob from the rich, you
give to the poor.

840
00:45:35,622 --> 00:45:37,457
Tell me comrade,
you gonna donate

841
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:40,259
your billions after
you get your boat,

842
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,661
or after you buy
your skyscraper?

843
00:45:41,694 --> 00:45:42,629
Santiago.

844
00:45:43,596 --> 00:45:45,732
You gonna put your name on it?

845
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:48,835
You think I'm
doing this for money?

846
00:45:50,703 --> 00:45:52,105
You think you'll
have a problem

847
00:45:52,138 --> 00:45:54,607
if I say something
about, you know?

848
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,678
No, go ahead.

849
00:45:59,846 --> 00:46:04,351
At the end, you were so
obsessed with beating it that,

850
00:46:05,685 --> 00:46:07,855
you couldn't accept
it when she lost.

851
00:46:07,888 --> 00:46:09,556
It wasn't beautiful.

852
00:46:10,656 --> 00:46:14,594
Losing her was
never gonna be pretty.

853
00:46:14,627 --> 00:46:17,631
Losing yourself,
that was the ugly part.

854
00:46:17,663 --> 00:46:20,633
Fighting these
pigs, that's good.

855
00:46:21,734 --> 00:46:23,503
Don't confuse
fighting with living

856
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:25,772
and distraction with healing.

857
00:46:35,381 --> 00:46:38,217
You think they might kill you?

858
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:40,286
Yeah, they probably will.

859
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,754
$2,000,000,000.

860
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:45,492
I'd do it for half.

861
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,161
You?

862
00:46:48,194 --> 00:46:49,462
You'd do it for free.

863
00:46:49,495 --> 00:46:51,198
Yeah, I would do it for free.

864
00:46:54,667 --> 00:46:55,736
You smell that?

865
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:58,171
Smell what?

866
00:46:58,205 --> 00:46:58,805
Smoke.

867
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:04,645
The trees.

868
00:47:06,446 --> 00:47:09,183
Santi, there
are a lotta men in there.

869
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:11,951
You take the north,
I'll take the south side.

870
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,835
Stop, the wind's changing!

871
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:30,970
We gotta get outta here.

872
00:47:31,004 --> 00:47:31,672
- Santi...
- There's nothing

873
00:47:31,705 --> 00:47:32,706
more we can do!

874
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:33,674
Go, come on!

875
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,989
They burned
my trees, Ralph.

876
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:51,857
20 acres gone up in smoke.

877
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:53,626
We can't prove
it was them, Fred.

878
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,761
We need facts.

879
00:47:54,794 --> 00:47:56,230
They don't care about facts.

880
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:58,265
They just, they, oh God.

881
00:47:59,832 --> 00:48:03,970
They just want, they
just, they want drama.

882
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:05,572
No, they want blood.

883
00:48:05,605 --> 00:48:08,275
They wanna see my writing
Gigi Cutler's name

884
00:48:08,308 --> 00:48:09,876
- in my own viscera.
- Prove it was them, Fred.

885
00:48:09,908 --> 00:48:10,810
We need proof.

886
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:12,712
South ranch needs spraying.

887
00:48:12,745 --> 00:48:14,013
Scientific evidence, Fred.

888
00:48:14,047 --> 00:48:15,682
We don't need to pull
any heartstrings.

889
00:48:15,714 --> 00:48:18,451
We're gonna need more
hands for the harvest, too.

890
00:48:18,484 --> 00:48:21,721
So what do
you suggest, Fred?

891
00:48:21,754 --> 00:48:22,756
Alex Gardner.

892
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:24,424
We flip that sleazy bastard.

893
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:25,592
We get him to testify for us

894
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:28,962
and then Shore Oil will be
dead in its own poison water.

895
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:31,598
- If we could find him.
- Found him.

896
00:48:31,631 --> 00:48:32,799
Well, where
the hell is he?

897
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:33,799
Where'd he go?

898
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:35,868
My source says he blew
town when he got canned.

899
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:37,437
That means he
could be anywhere.

900
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:39,339
Nope, he's right here.

901
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:40,806
Will you please shut up?

902
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:42,675
I'm trying to do some work here.

903
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:43,910
What?

904
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:53,553
Santiago, why do I even
let you in the house?

905
00:48:56,489 --> 00:48:57,291
Fred?

906
00:48:57,323 --> 00:48:58,024
Yeah, hold on, Ralph.

907
00:48:58,058 --> 00:48:59,626
Just a second.

908
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:01,727
- Well, Koko I'm not just here
- Ralph?

909
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:03,062
To dance with
your lovely cohost.

910
00:49:03,096 --> 00:49:04,564
Ralph, turn on your TV.

911
00:49:04,596 --> 00:49:06,432
- Doug, take notes you slob.
- What for?

912
00:49:07,667 --> 00:49:08,869
I am here to make
an announcement

913
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:10,804
on behalf of Shore
Energy about somethin'

914
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:13,640
we're doin' to change the way
we do good in this county.

915
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:16,910
We are starting the first
ever non-profit community

916
00:49:16,942 --> 00:49:18,844
wish fulfillment foundation.

917
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,382
Wow, well it sounds sweet,
Alex, but let's be frank.

918
00:49:22,415 --> 00:49:25,018
What do I have to be riddled
with to get my wish fulfilled?

919
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,652
All I care about.

920
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:27,754
Nothin' at all, Koko.

921
00:49:27,786 --> 00:49:28,620
This is for everyone.

922
00:49:28,654 --> 00:49:31,390
Teachers, preachers,
doctors, coaches.

923
00:49:31,424 --> 00:49:33,493
You apply, we supply.

924
00:49:33,526 --> 00:49:34,861
Cash money money.

925
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:35,828
Exactly.

926
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:37,763
From this day forward,
Shore Energy is gonna

927
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:40,801
be here to help bring
this community home.

928
00:49:52,946 --> 00:49:53,781
Energy?

929
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:58,919
It's got a nice
environmentally responsible ring.

930
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:02,488
That's not your call to make.

931
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:03,924
No,
I was outta line.

932
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:11,864
And Gardner.

933
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:15,102
He will not represent this firm.

934
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:18,671
G, keeping Alex
smiling keeps us safe.

935
00:50:19,672 --> 00:50:21,440
Kid's a star.

936
00:50:21,473 --> 00:50:24,443
He's an embarrassment,
a liability.

937
00:50:24,477 --> 00:50:26,980
But at the end of the
day, whose fault is that?

938
00:50:27,013 --> 00:50:28,415
Not you.

939
00:50:28,448 --> 00:50:30,116
You brought him
in, you cut him out.

940
00:50:30,149 --> 00:50:32,585
What'd you expect
was gonna happen?

941
00:50:32,618 --> 00:50:33,953
He was just gonna disappear.

942
00:50:33,986 --> 00:50:34,854
I would've...

943
00:50:34,888 --> 00:50:36,089
- What?
- I would've...

944
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:41,728
What would you have done?

945
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:43,497
Hm?

946
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:48,834
Answer me, now!

947
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:49,870
Go ahead.

948
00:50:51,571 --> 00:50:52,373
Moo.

949
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:56,743
Miss Gore, from
this moment forward

950
00:50:56,777 --> 00:50:59,546
you will report directly to me
on all case related matters.

951
00:51:10,857 --> 00:51:13,893
You know, Gigi, I
watched you rise.

952
00:51:13,926 --> 00:51:16,762
Shatter that glass ceiling,

953
00:51:16,796 --> 00:51:19,466
and cut throats with the shards.

954
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:25,939
Don't make me call Houston.

955
00:51:36,815 --> 00:51:40,486
You are in fact,
Professor John Orlan, PhD?

956
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,755
Is that correct, Sir?

957
00:51:41,788 --> 00:51:44,024
This is cold, hard,
professional facts.

958
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:46,892
This proves in fact,
a sample extracted

959
00:51:46,926 --> 00:51:50,964
from Fred Stern's ground
water on March 27th, 2017.

960
00:51:53,198 --> 00:51:54,500
Is that correct?

961
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:55,468
Your Honor,
requesting permission

962
00:51:55,502 --> 00:51:56,636
to enter into evidence...

963
00:52:17,756 --> 00:52:19,058
The day has finally come.

964
00:52:19,091 --> 00:52:19,992
Here it is.

965
00:52:20,026 --> 00:52:21,094
Welcome home!

966
00:52:37,944 --> 00:52:39,246
On behalf of Shore Energy,

967
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:42,748
we would like to
award you $4,500!

968
00:52:42,781 --> 00:52:43,682
Wow!

969
00:52:43,716 --> 00:52:44,918
$9,500!

970
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:48,054
Now that's gonna be $10,000!

971
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,097
That's nice!

972
00:52:59,098 --> 00:53:00,100
Get in there.

973
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:12,745
Mr. Stenson what
you're telling me

974
00:53:12,779 --> 00:53:13,947
is that this is clean water?

975
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,649
This is clean water
and this is clean water

976
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:17,283
and that's Fred Stern's farm,

977
00:53:17,317 --> 00:53:18,952
and you're telling me that this

978
00:53:18,984 --> 00:53:23,622
is 100% usable water for
all irrigation purposes?

979
00:53:51,718 --> 00:53:52,953
Mr. Stern,
do you know what

980
00:53:52,986 --> 00:53:55,589
the net present value rule is?

981
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:57,123
No, I don't.

982
00:53:57,156 --> 00:53:59,125
Have you ever heard
of the net present value rule?

983
00:53:59,158 --> 00:54:00,060
No.

984
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:00,794
Has any member of the court?

985
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:02,027
Miss Gore?

986
00:54:02,062 --> 00:54:05,031
Your Honor, do you know what
the net present value rule is?

987
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:07,968
I'm quite certain you
are about to tell us all.

988
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,169
Proceed, Mr. Aegis.

989
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:10,002
Thank you, Your Honor.

990
00:54:10,035 --> 00:54:10,836
May it please the court.

991
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,172
The net present
value rule states,

992
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:15,140
if you make more money doing it

993
00:54:15,174 --> 00:54:17,844
than what it would cost if
you get caught doing it,

994
00:54:17,877 --> 00:54:19,112
continue doing it.

995
00:54:19,145 --> 00:54:19,946
Objection, Your Honor.

996
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:20,747
Leading the witness.

997
00:54:20,779 --> 00:54:22,015
Sustained.

998
00:54:22,047 --> 00:54:23,116
- Get to the point, Aegis.
- Very well, Your Honor.

999
00:54:23,149 --> 00:54:26,620
Now then, Mr. Stern, there's
no doubt that your land

1000
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:29,989
has been polluted by
contaminated waste water.

1001
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:32,257
Help me to understand
something, please.

1002
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:36,028
Do you believe that a
multinational corporation

1003
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:39,665
like Shore Oil needed to do
what you say they'd done?

1004
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:41,166
No.

1005
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,703
No, I, I think they needed
to do just the opposite.

1006
00:54:43,736 --> 00:54:45,105
But surely you can't expect us

1007
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:48,107
to believe there was any
intention to destroy your farm.

1008
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,075
I mean, what was

1009
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:50,009
- there to gain?
- The silver fox

1010
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:51,210
is asking all my questions.

1011
00:54:51,243 --> 00:54:53,879
Well, I don't think
they intended it.

1012
00:54:53,913 --> 00:54:56,216
Just like I don't
think BP intended

1013
00:54:56,248 --> 00:54:59,652
the Deepwater Horizon
to blow sky high.

1014
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:01,187
But this isn't about intentions.

1015
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:05,325
If I'm not mistaken, this
is about responsibilities.

1016
00:55:05,357 --> 00:55:07,126
Now, Shore Oil knew
what was happening

1017
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,761
but they didn't stop pumping

1018
00:55:08,794 --> 00:55:11,664
their waste water
into those ponds.

1019
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,133
They didn't build any barriers,

1020
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:16,402
they certainly didn't
let me know what was up.

1021
00:55:16,435 --> 00:55:21,642
They just sat on it, pumping
their poison into my earth.

1022
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:23,843
But aren't you
assuming they knew?

1023
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,944
Well, if they didn't why did

1024
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:28,847
they offer to buy
more pore space?

1025
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,183
Good question, Mr. Stern.

1026
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,218
Why don't you answer it?

1027
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:35,220
Well, they offered to buy
it because Gigi Cutler knew,

1028
00:55:35,254 --> 00:55:36,956
and that's why she
sent Alex Gardner

1029
00:55:36,989 --> 00:55:39,359
to make me an offer of $50,000,

1030
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,728
and then if I'd taken that

1031
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:44,096
I'd have lost
everything, everything.

1032
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:45,297
But I said no.

1033
00:55:47,332 --> 00:55:50,936
Kinda makes me wonder
how many people say yes.

1034
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:52,439
How many hard working people

1035
00:55:52,471 --> 00:55:55,374
get trumped on by
these companies

1036
00:55:55,408 --> 00:55:58,877
and then they can
never tell the tale.

1037
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,079
Now, I've been accused of bein'

1038
00:56:00,113 --> 00:56:01,948
some kind of an environmentalist

1039
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,051
and a green peace
person, a crusader.

1040
00:56:08,254 --> 00:56:10,957
But that's not fair,
I don't rate that.

1041
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:13,225
I'm just an American farmer.

1042
00:56:13,259 --> 00:56:16,329
I do battle with Mother
Earth every damn day.

1043
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:17,730
Thank you, Mr. Stern.

1044
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:18,832
Your witness.

1045
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:23,904
Mr. Stern.

1046
00:56:26,939 --> 00:56:28,141
You come here often?

1047
00:56:28,174 --> 00:56:29,409
Yes, I do.

1048
00:56:29,442 --> 00:56:31,111
I like to look in
on things myself.

1049
00:56:31,143 --> 00:56:32,812
Hm, that's nice.

1050
00:56:32,844 --> 00:56:34,913
And your business,
that which you accused

1051
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:38,317
my client of ruining, who looks
after that for you all day

1052
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,785
- every day you're here?
- I have a foreman.

1053
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:41,921
His name is Santiago
Compestella.

1054
00:56:41,953 --> 00:56:43,856
Santiago Compestella.

1055
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:47,861
Santiago Compestella.

1056
00:56:50,062 --> 00:56:51,297
All right.

1057
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,466
If you should somehow
prove your case

1058
00:56:53,498 --> 00:56:56,102
and be awarded $2,000,000,000,

1059
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,303
would Shore Energy have
to close its doors...

1060
00:56:58,337 --> 00:56:59,305
Objection, Your Honor.

1061
00:56:59,337 --> 00:57:01,006
- Irrelevant.
- Sustained.

1062
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,509
Putting half a community
of hard working patriots

1063
00:57:03,542 --> 00:57:06,178
out of a job because
of one man's selfish...

1064
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:07,380
Objection, Your Honor.

1065
00:57:07,413 --> 00:57:08,314
Move to strike.

1066
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:09,248
Sustained.

1067
00:57:09,281 --> 00:57:11,417
Miss Gore, that is enough.

1068
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:28,433
There's an alien
in these parts,

1069
00:57:28,466 --> 00:57:31,238
of the illegal Mexican variety.

1070
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:34,039
Mm hm.

1071
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:37,376
Santiago Compestella.

1072
00:57:40,279 --> 00:57:41,114
Hm?

1073
00:57:42,214 --> 00:57:45,350
But don't worry, I've taken
the necessary precautions

1074
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:49,489
to make sure that he'll
be deported, tonight.

1075
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:53,092
Are you trying to impress me,

1076
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:56,228
with your parochial
intimidation tactics?

1077
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:58,030
Oh, you're so cute.

1078
00:58:41,207 --> 00:58:42,042
Oh.

1079
00:58:43,308 --> 00:58:45,911
Touch me again.

1080
00:58:45,944 --> 00:58:46,580
What?

1081
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:51,084
Like this?

1082
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:12,872
You know, I could protect you.

1083
00:59:17,243 --> 00:59:19,478
You're an excuse of a man.

1084
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:20,546
A sad excuse?

1085
00:59:21,379 --> 00:59:22,381
Poor excuse?

1086
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:25,185
A drunk excuse?

1087
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,457
Little piece of free advice.

1088
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:34,426
When you're offered
a shot of salvation,

1089
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,997
you should probably take it.

1090
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:39,298
Slither away.

1091
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:43,236
Slither.

1092
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:45,205
Oh, Gigi, Gigi, Gigi.

1093
00:59:46,471 --> 00:59:47,306
Yeah.

1094
00:59:48,408 --> 00:59:52,545
You have no idea how high
I intend to fly do you?

1095
00:59:52,578 --> 00:59:54,381
Snakes don't fly.

1096
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:57,116
Well, watch me soar.

1097
01:00:21,473 --> 01:00:22,475
Venmo?

1098
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:24,143
I don't have it.

1099
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:26,446
Instagram ,

1100
01:00:26,478 --> 01:00:29,681
Facebook.

1101
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:38,291
What can I get you?

1102
01:00:38,323 --> 01:00:40,092
Tallest glass
of beer there ever was.

1103
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:41,326
Comin' right up.

1104
01:01:00,413 --> 01:01:02,282
Santiago Compestella.

1105
01:01:03,482 --> 01:01:07,152
My, my, my, you are a
long ways from home.

1106
01:01:08,486 --> 01:01:09,555
You have a problem?

1107
01:01:09,587 --> 01:01:11,690
Back off.

1108
01:01:11,723 --> 01:01:14,459
Juan, Carlos, Rodriguez.

1109
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:16,562
How goes it boys?

1110
01:01:16,594 --> 01:01:18,031
And how's your mama?

1111
01:01:18,064 --> 01:01:20,632
She must be missin'
Juarez somethin' fierce.

1112
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:22,602
What about you, Gloria?

1113
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:25,605
Do you pine for chihuahua?

1114
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:27,373
Not them.

1115
01:01:27,406 --> 01:01:28,541
I'm warning you.

1116
01:01:28,573 --> 01:01:31,777
Oh.

1117
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,546
He's warning me.

1118
01:01:33,578 --> 01:01:35,614
Well, I guess I better explain

1119
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:39,051
a little somethin'
to you taco lovers.

1120
01:01:39,085 --> 01:01:41,320
This is not your country.

1121
01:01:41,352 --> 01:01:43,722
This is not your
world, it's mine.

1122
01:01:43,756 --> 01:01:48,627
And I will use, abuse and
discard you just as I see fit.

1123
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:56,669
So step up or walk on.

1124
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,211
You know,

1125
01:02:10,482 --> 01:02:13,618
you're not gonna be able to
get away with this anymore.

1126
01:02:13,652 --> 01:02:16,522
Said the Indian
to the calvary.

1127
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:18,091
I tell you what,

1128
01:02:19,658 --> 01:02:21,294
why don't you put

1129
01:02:21,326 --> 01:02:24,830
that stinking Mexican mouth
all over my big sloppy...

1130
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:33,638
Well, holy shit, we
got an uppity wetback.

1131
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:39,078
I hope you suck as
soft as you hit.

1132
01:02:43,616 --> 01:02:45,551
That felt good, I gotta say,

1133
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:49,721
but can you please, can you
please just give me one more.

1134
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:51,857
Come on, hit me again
you spent bitch.

1135
01:02:59,564 --> 01:03:00,398
Holy shit.

1136
01:03:02,768 --> 01:03:05,505
Okay, that'll do.

1137
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:08,373
What was that?

1138
01:03:18,317 --> 01:03:21,521
This car belongs to that.

1139
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,749
Is this true?

1140
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,951
The assault?

1141
01:03:51,984 --> 01:03:53,585
No.

1142
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:57,689
But the arson ,

1143
01:03:57,723 --> 01:03:58,658
yes.

1144
01:04:00,926 --> 01:04:03,462
I seen your papers, Santi.

1145
01:04:04,663 --> 01:04:05,665
You saw papers.

1146
01:04:05,698 --> 01:04:06,866
Forgeries?

1147
01:04:06,899 --> 01:04:09,801
- They were good.
- Oh, yeah.

1148
01:04:09,835 --> 01:04:12,939
Yeah, real good
and really stupid.

1149
01:04:12,971 --> 01:04:15,341
How could you have done...

1150
01:04:16,442 --> 01:04:17,443
You son of a bitch.

1151
01:04:17,475 --> 01:04:19,945
You know how this is gonna look.

1152
01:04:21,513 --> 01:04:25,651
Tell me, Fred, how
is this gonna look?

1153
01:04:25,683 --> 01:04:29,721
Like I'm going around
burning things in the town?

1154
01:04:29,754 --> 01:04:32,224
No, I'm an illegal with a bone

1155
01:04:32,257 --> 01:04:33,725
- to pick and I got
- It's gonna look like

1156
01:04:33,759 --> 01:04:35,228
- a lotta reason why I should.
- I've got a damn terrorist

1157
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:37,330
running my farm.

1158
01:04:37,363 --> 01:04:38,564
This is about the case.

1159
01:04:38,596 --> 01:04:39,531
Yeah, of course
it's about the case.

1160
01:04:39,564 --> 01:04:40,765
What did you think it was about.

1161
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:43,469
I mean, how could you have been

1162
01:04:43,502 --> 01:04:44,971
so ungrateful to do this to me?

1163
01:04:45,004 --> 01:04:46,272
Sir, can you take me back

1164
01:04:46,305 --> 01:04:47,772
- to my cell please?
- To me?

1165
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:48,540
- Santi, really, please.
- You know what

1166
01:04:48,573 --> 01:04:50,776
- I'm gonna miss, Fred?
- Oh, what?

1167
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:54,247
You know?

1168
01:04:56,448 --> 01:04:57,283
My phone.

1169
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:16,602
You okay?

1170
01:05:16,634 --> 01:05:17,837
You look like shit.

1171
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:18,971
I must've called
40 times last night.

1172
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:20,672
Why the hell didn't you pick up?

1173
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:23,008
I had to shut off the phone
so I could focus on today.

1174
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:24,576
We're gonna sink a showboat.

1175
01:05:24,609 --> 01:05:25,810
Ralph, you need
to know something.

1176
01:05:25,843 --> 01:05:27,446
- It's...
- All rise.

1177
01:05:48,834 --> 01:05:49,969
Mr. Aegis?

1178
01:05:50,002 --> 01:05:50,969
Are those
gonna be the witnesses?

1179
01:05:51,002 --> 01:05:53,006
Thank you, Your Honor.

1180
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,409
Good morning, Mr. Gardner.

1181
01:05:56,442 --> 01:05:57,743
Good morning, Ralph.

1182
01:05:57,776 --> 01:05:59,411
Did you or did you
not make my client,

1183
01:05:59,444 --> 01:06:02,814
Fred Stern, an offer
to buy his pore space?

1184
01:06:02,848 --> 01:06:05,317
I just wanted to help him out.

1185
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:07,986
It's kinda what I do.

1186
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:11,924
And this is before you
actually worked for Shore Oil?

1187
01:06:11,957 --> 01:06:13,625
Do you remember a time when

1188
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:16,628
you didn't have to work some
place to help out a neighbor?

1189
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:19,064
So you thought you
were doing Mr. Stern

1190
01:06:19,098 --> 01:06:20,900
a favor by covering up the fact

1191
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,035
that Shore Oil was
polluting his farm?

1192
01:06:23,067 --> 01:06:24,437
The fact?

1193
01:06:24,469 --> 01:06:26,605
Come on, Ralph, you're
better than that.

1194
01:06:26,638 --> 01:06:27,706
Excuse me, Sir,
are you now denying

1195
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:30,009
- that you made Mr. Stern...
- I'm not denying anything.

1196
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:31,911
You got your
scientific mumbo jumbo

1197
01:06:31,944 --> 01:06:36,482
and your test tubes and
beakers and whatnot.

1198
01:06:36,515 --> 01:06:38,850
But I actually know this man.

1199
01:06:38,884 --> 01:06:40,753
I worked for him
everyday in high school

1200
01:06:40,785 --> 01:06:43,555
in between football practice
and helpin' out my mom.

1201
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:46,826
You paint a heroic
picture of yourself, Sir.

1202
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:50,029
I just like to look
for the good in folks,

1203
01:06:50,062 --> 01:06:52,765
and Fred, Fred is a class act.

1204
01:06:53,966 --> 01:06:55,634
But times are tough.

1205
01:06:56,835 --> 01:07:00,906
Money is tight and ever
since Nancy passed away,

1206
01:07:00,939 --> 01:07:04,944
and the fact that he's had
an illegal runnin' his farm,

1207
01:07:04,977 --> 01:07:06,612
I figured he needed the money.

1208
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:07,780
Objection, Your Honor.

1209
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:09,381
- That's irrelevant.
- What?

1210
01:07:09,415 --> 01:07:10,049
It's true.

1211
01:07:10,082 --> 01:07:11,616
Move to strike.

1212
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:12,417
Sustained.

1213
01:07:12,451 --> 01:07:13,686
Control your witness,

1214
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:14,152
- Mr. Aegis.
- Would it were possible,

1215
01:07:14,185 --> 01:07:15,086
Your Honor.

1216
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,455
Do you not want them to hear?

1217
01:07:16,488 --> 01:07:17,957
What is it that
Abraham Lincoln said?

1218
01:07:17,989 --> 01:07:19,924
Do you remember the words of
our President Abraham Lincoln?

1219
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:22,694
"The truth will set you free."

1220
01:07:22,727 --> 01:07:24,629
Actually, Mr.
Gardner that was Jesus.

1221
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:25,498
John 8:32.

1222
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:28,433
Oh.

1223
01:07:28,466 --> 01:07:30,969
Well, I do think there
are more subtle ways

1224
01:07:31,002 --> 01:07:34,006
to let anyone know that
you go to church on Sunday.

1225
01:07:34,038 --> 01:07:34,973
Thank you, Your Honor.

1226
01:07:35,006 --> 01:07:35,907
No further question.

1227
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:37,676
I am done with this witness.

1228
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:39,111
Thank you, Ralph.

1229
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:41,913
Miss Gore.

1230
01:07:41,946 --> 01:07:43,181
Thank you, Your Honor.

1231
01:07:43,214 --> 01:07:45,017
Alex, pleasure.

1232
01:07:45,049 --> 01:07:46,718
It's all mine.

1233
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:48,954
I am just happy to finally
set the record straight.

1234
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:49,821
Great.

1235
01:07:51,022 --> 01:07:52,158
Tell us about that
night at Ozzie's.

1236
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,625
What happened?

1237
01:07:53,658 --> 01:07:55,927
He said and I quote,

1238
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,430
"To hell with the
whole damn valley.

1239
01:07:58,464 --> 01:08:01,933
"If Shore wants what I
got, they can have it all.

1240
01:08:01,966 --> 01:08:05,003
"But I need to take them
for every last cent I can.

1241
01:08:05,036 --> 01:08:08,107
"70,000's my minimum,
you understand?

1242
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,775
"I want more."

1243
01:08:09,808 --> 01:08:12,945
I never woulda thought that
he was talkin' billions.

1244
01:08:12,977 --> 01:08:14,813
Screw you, Stern!

1245
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:15,980
Order!

1246
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:17,216
Order!

1247
01:08:24,188 --> 01:08:25,657
I'd like to
enter into evidence

1248
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:28,861
an arrest report for
Santiago Compestella,

1249
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:30,062
- an illegal alien
- This is what I was trying

1250
01:08:30,095 --> 01:08:31,197
- who has been
- to tell you about

1251
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:32,598
- on Mr. Stern's payroll
- this morning.

1252
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:33,765
- for over 30 years.
- Objection, Your Honor.

1253
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:34,600
Irrelevant.

1254
01:08:34,632 --> 01:08:35,733
Sustained.

1255
01:08:35,768 --> 01:08:40,706
Miss Gore, Mr. Aegis, join
me in chambers immediately.

1256
01:08:41,907 --> 01:08:44,543
Miss Gore, I will not have
grandstanding in my courtroom.

1257
01:08:44,576 --> 01:08:47,046
Your Honor, I was simply
making evidence available.

1258
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:47,979
Oh, come on, Olive.

1259
01:08:48,013 --> 01:08:49,215
You wanna play dirty, fine.

1260
01:08:49,247 --> 01:08:51,649
But for God sakes
show a little class.

1261
01:08:51,683 --> 01:08:54,053
Compestella's crimes
must be made known

1262
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:55,855
- to the jury.
- It's already public record,

1263
01:08:55,888 --> 01:08:57,555
Your Honor and need I remind

1264
01:08:57,589 --> 01:08:59,658
my esteemed colleague that being

1265
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:02,862
an undocumented
immigrant is not a crime.

1266
01:09:02,894 --> 01:09:05,063
Yet, but arson
and assault are.

1267
01:09:05,096 --> 01:09:06,764
Also, there's this.

1268
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:07,599
Susan?

1269
01:09:07,632 --> 01:09:08,834
What's this all about?

1270
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:09,868
This is new evidence
I would like Your Honor

1271
01:09:09,902 --> 01:09:12,671
to review before we
enter into public record.

1272
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:15,139
Oh my, what a concept.

1273
01:09:15,172 --> 01:09:17,142
Would you
like to use the restroom

1274
01:09:17,175 --> 01:09:18,911
before the movie starts?

1275
01:09:18,943 --> 01:09:20,645
I think I can hold it.

1276
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:21,681
We'll see.

1277
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:26,151
Why is he naked?

1278
01:09:26,184 --> 01:09:29,555
Technically
he's in a towel.

1279
01:09:30,855 --> 01:09:32,959
Was in a towel.

1280
01:09:33,959 --> 01:09:36,828
Ralph, it's
just hearsay, right?

1281
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:37,696
That's all they got.

1282
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:39,499
You said so yourself.

1283
01:09:40,165 --> 01:09:41,065
What are you talkin' about?

1284
01:09:41,099 --> 01:09:42,535
They just knocked us out.

1285
01:09:42,568 --> 01:09:45,571
Well, it's my word
against his, right?

1286
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:47,206
Did you say it?

1287
01:09:48,739 --> 01:09:49,575
Okay.

1288
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:53,178
So, what do you
wanna do now, lie?

1289
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:54,880
No, I wanna win.

1290
01:09:54,912 --> 01:09:56,014
I gotta win this, Ralph.

1291
01:09:56,047 --> 01:09:58,149
They're poisoning my water.

1292
01:09:58,183 --> 01:10:00,719
You've had an undocumented
immigrant running

1293
01:10:00,751 --> 01:10:01,852
your farm for 30 years and now

1294
01:10:01,886 --> 01:10:04,956
they have a security video
of you running around naked

1295
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:07,292
and threatening Gardner
with a golf club.

1296
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:08,961
Oh, come on, I just...

1297
01:10:08,993 --> 01:10:11,630
You know what that jury sees
now when they look at you?

1298
01:10:11,662 --> 01:10:13,933
A con artist, a thief.

1299
01:10:13,965 --> 01:10:16,167
And when they get a load
of that video in court,

1300
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:18,203
you're gonna look
like a lunatic, too.

1301
01:10:18,236 --> 01:10:21,040
So, go ahead, double down,
lie, be like everybody else,

1302
01:10:21,072 --> 01:10:23,142
but don't expect me
to be a part of it.

1303
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:24,076
It's over.

1304
01:10:24,108 --> 01:10:25,777
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1305
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:28,112
No, it does no end like this.

1306
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,114
What, what, do they
get to drag me through

1307
01:10:30,148 --> 01:10:31,984
the dirt and steal
everything I've got

1308
01:10:32,017 --> 01:10:34,053
and then they just
get to walk away?

1309
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:35,955
Maybe we can
work out some kind

1310
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:37,789
of settlement and
you can start over.

1311
01:10:37,822 --> 01:10:39,057
Yeah, well, that's probably

1312
01:10:39,090 --> 01:10:40,291
the way you killed
the Pinto, right?

1313
01:10:40,325 --> 01:10:42,126
With the deal?

1314
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,796
Some kind of dragon
slayer you are.

1315
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:46,297
Oh, go to hell.

1316
01:10:46,331 --> 01:10:49,001
All you ever really cared
about was the money anyway.

1317
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:51,103
All you ever cared
about was bein' relevant.

1318
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,004
Am I right?

1319
01:10:53,037 --> 01:10:53,839
Has been.

1320
01:10:54,906 --> 01:10:56,075
At least I was.

1321
01:11:04,282 --> 01:11:06,085
Fred, you still there?

1322
01:11:08,053 --> 01:11:09,787
He's through.

1323
01:11:09,821 --> 01:11:11,256
Offer the settlement.

1324
01:11:11,288 --> 01:11:13,392
Is she even necessary anymore?

1325
01:11:13,425 --> 01:11:14,260
Be nice.

1326
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:16,795
We got him ball the balls.

1327
01:11:16,827 --> 01:11:18,663
Now you take his head.

1328
01:11:19,764 --> 01:11:23,701
You drank the
Kool-Aid, haven't you?

1329
01:11:23,734 --> 01:11:25,170
Alex is right.

1330
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:26,138
Who's gonna come
after us after

1331
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,172
we burn him into the ground?

1332
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:29,208
Nobody.

1333
01:11:30,075 --> 01:11:32,176
His lawyer.

1334
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:35,881
He finds somethin',
some proof that we knew.

1335
01:11:36,915 --> 01:11:39,285
What, are you gonna tell him?

1336
01:11:40,818 --> 01:11:42,153
This is bullshit.

1337
01:11:42,187 --> 01:11:44,055
I got a thing to get to.

1338
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:46,257
So, you can handle
this, right, Boss?

1339
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,727
Oh, yes, Sir.

1340
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:54,332
- Gigi, I...
- Oh,

1341
01:11:54,366 --> 01:11:55,801
I've been meanin' to tell you,

1342
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,135
I'm gonna reach
out to your firm.

1343
01:11:57,169 --> 01:11:58,836
I'm gonna make a
point of tellin'

1344
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:01,372
the partners how optimistic
I am about your future.

1345
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:15,254
Do you think
you can do my job?

1346
01:12:17,054 --> 01:12:19,157
Oh, babe, I already am.

1347
01:12:20,358 --> 01:12:22,161
It's feelin' pretty permanent.

1348
01:12:22,193 --> 01:12:23,261
Like death?

1349
01:12:24,729 --> 01:12:26,864
Shoulda took my advice.

1350
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:29,234
Don't worry, you'll
get your stock options.

1351
01:12:29,267 --> 01:12:32,071
Golden parachute, all that shit.

1352
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:34,206
That is if we win.

1353
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:35,306
If we lose...

1354
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:38,077
Go to hell.

1355
01:12:39,411 --> 01:12:40,779
I like it here.

1356
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,496
Oh come on, Wally.

1357
01:12:57,528 --> 01:13:00,732
You know I'm not
what they say I am.

1358
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:42,840
You can't just die.

1359
01:13:42,873 --> 01:13:43,776
Yeah, I'm right here.

1360
01:13:43,809 --> 01:13:45,210
I'm right here, yeah, yeah.

1361
01:13:45,242 --> 01:13:46,477
I'm gonna sit you up.

1362
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:47,312
I got to.

1363
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:51,216
It's
too late, Fred.

1364
01:13:51,248 --> 01:13:52,350
No!

1365
01:13:52,384 --> 01:13:54,319
Hell, I mean, no!

1366
01:13:54,352 --> 01:13:55,254
Get over here.

1367
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:56,088
Mr. Stern.

1368
01:14:02,527 --> 01:14:04,196
Come here, come on.

1369
01:14:15,172 --> 01:14:17,309
Santi, what am I gonna do?

1370
01:14:22,179 --> 01:14:23,915
Oh, come on, come on.

1371
01:14:25,015 --> 01:14:26,184
Don't do this.

1372
01:14:29,254 --> 01:14:30,288
Please, please.

1373
01:14:37,127 --> 01:14:39,799
It's been quite a spell, I know.

1374
01:14:43,367 --> 01:14:46,805
You might not like me
much anymore, girl.

1375
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:52,044
God, I miss the hell outta ya.

1376
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:22,173
I'm not here.

1377
01:15:23,675 --> 01:15:25,344
You better not be.

1378
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:28,346
Quiet, Freddy.

1379
01:15:29,346 --> 01:15:30,950
Listen to me now.

1380
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:39,957
Who's ready?

1381
01:15:39,991 --> 01:15:41,460
- Me!
- You?

1382
01:15:41,492 --> 01:15:43,160
I'm ready, girl.

1383
01:15:43,193 --> 01:15:46,364
Shore
Energy, we thank you!

1384
01:16:17,996 --> 01:16:19,398
What are you doin'?

1385
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:22,401
Same thing
as you, killing Gigi.

1386
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,997
Mr. Stern, nice weekend?

1387
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:54,466
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

1388
01:16:54,498 --> 01:16:59,037
Yeah, listen, Ralph, I'm
sorry I called you a has been.

1389
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:01,105
I was way outta line.

1390
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:04,509
If anything you're a
, you're an is now.

1391
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:08,079
Okay, Fred, but I'm still
not gonna let you lie.

1392
01:17:08,112 --> 01:17:10,114
You're not gonna have to.

1393
01:17:12,617 --> 01:17:14,553
I'm gonna ask for a recess so

1394
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:15,554
we can start working
on a settlement.

1395
01:17:15,586 --> 01:17:17,288
- No, Ralph, I don't want a...
- Fred, we've got

1396
01:17:17,322 --> 01:17:18,556
a very good chance
for a settlement.

1397
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:19,224
Not yet.

1398
01:17:20,692 --> 01:17:22,394
This is not going well for us.

1399
01:17:22,426 --> 01:17:25,162
I know, I told you in the
bathroom I wanna win, okay?

1400
01:17:25,196 --> 01:17:27,431
Get Gigi Cutler on the stand.

1401
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,371
You know
something I don't.

1402
01:17:32,403 --> 01:17:33,270
Get her up there.

1403
01:17:33,304 --> 01:17:34,105
Okay.

1404
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,678
Your Honor, the plaintiff
calls Miss Regina Cutler

1405
01:17:40,711 --> 01:17:42,179
to the stand, please.

1406
01:17:44,215 --> 01:17:47,586
Miss
Cutler, to the stand.

1407
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:49,520
I'm not even ready for
what this is gonna be.

1408
01:18:07,538 --> 01:18:09,674
Raise
your right hand.

1409
01:18:09,706 --> 01:18:10,508
Regina Cutler...

1410
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:12,109
My mother was Regina.

1411
01:18:12,143 --> 01:18:13,278
Me?

1412
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,446
Gigi.

1413
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:16,515
Gigi Cutler, do
you swear to tell the truth,

1414
01:18:16,547 --> 01:18:18,282
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth?

1415
01:18:18,315 --> 01:18:19,550
So help me God.

1416
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:23,788
Good morning, Miss Cutler.

1417
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:25,190
Thank you for joining us.

1418
01:18:25,223 --> 01:18:27,591
Ask the question, Aegis.

1419
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,161
Miss Cutler.

1420
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:31,662
Lance, let the man do his job.

1421
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,135
Come on.

1422
01:18:38,269 --> 01:18:39,104
Ask.

1423
01:18:41,572 --> 01:18:43,707
Very well, Ma'am.

1424
01:18:43,741 --> 01:18:48,747
Did Shore Oil continuously
poison Fred Stern's ground water

1425
01:18:49,581 --> 01:18:50,681
for 10 years?

1426
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:00,591
Yes.

1427
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:03,861
Order.

1428
01:19:04,862 --> 01:19:06,764
Order.

1429
01:19:06,797 --> 01:19:08,200
Order.

1430
01:19:10,902 --> 01:19:12,504
Just unbelievable.

1431
01:19:15,273 --> 01:19:16,641
I learned the night before

1432
01:19:16,674 --> 01:19:19,644
that you man was under
suspicion by the local police,

1433
01:19:19,676 --> 01:19:22,647
for arson and falsifying
evidence against one

1434
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:24,482
of Stern's laborers.

1435
01:19:24,515 --> 01:19:26,617
Knowing the damage this
would cause our case,

1436
01:19:26,651 --> 01:19:28,553
not to mention our reputation,

1437
01:19:28,586 --> 01:19:31,290
I had only one option, end it.

1438
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:33,792
Yes.

1439
01:19:33,825 --> 01:19:37,696
Shore Oil poisoned Mr.
Stern's ground water.

1440
01:19:54,679 --> 01:19:57,248
Thank you for
that, Miss Cutler.

1441
01:19:57,282 --> 01:19:59,218
Now, as to the coverup,

1442
01:20:02,452 --> 01:20:06,724
can you tell the court why
Mr. Alex Gardner offered

1443
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,495
to buy Mr. Stern's pore space?

1444
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:18,937
Alex Gardner didn't
work for us at the time.

1445
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,706
He was either
lying to Mr. Stern,

1446
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:22,806
or he's lying to the court.

1447
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:23,875
She's lying!

1448
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:25,209
Mr. Gardner, I will hold you

1449
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:26,710
- in contempt!
- You filthy bitch!

1450
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,246
- Contempt!
- Oh boy.

1451
01:20:28,278 --> 01:20:29,480
Be
silent, Mr. Gardner.

1452
01:20:29,514 --> 01:20:30,315
Well, hold...

1453
01:20:30,348 --> 01:20:31,248
Bailiff?

1454
01:20:31,282 --> 01:20:31,783
I run this shit hole town.

1455
01:20:32,884 --> 01:20:34,719
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1456
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:35,754
Oo.

1457
01:20:36,688 --> 01:20:38,223
No, no!

1458
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:39,857
- Oh my God.
- Un-fuckin'-believable.

1459
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:42,560
- You're hurting him.
- Fuckin' lying bitch!

1460
01:20:42,594 --> 01:20:43,862
- Alex!
- Fuck you!

1461
01:20:43,894 --> 01:20:44,795
Stop movin', Sir.

1462
01:20:44,828 --> 01:20:45,729
- Come on.
- Fuck you!

1463
01:20:45,763 --> 01:20:46,797
You blamed it on Gardner?

1464
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,700
No one would believe that shit.

1465
01:20:48,733 --> 01:20:53,471
It as on record and he'd
never get a chance to deny it.

1466
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,775
We settled with
Stern the next day.

1467
01:20:56,808 --> 01:20:58,210
Case closed.

1468
01:20:58,242 --> 01:20:59,544
Thank you, Miss Cutler.

1469
01:20:59,577 --> 01:21:00,679
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1470
01:21:00,711 --> 01:21:02,446
Witness is excused.

1471
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:04,348
Counselors approach.

1472
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:06,884
All right, thank
you very much.

1473
01:21:11,889 --> 01:21:13,658
Your Honor, in light of
whatever that just was...

1474
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:14,459
We finished?

1475
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:17,629
Yeah, looks that
way, doesn't it?

1476
01:21:20,465 --> 01:21:23,702
I'll have your settlement
delivered this evening.

1477
01:21:23,734 --> 01:21:25,469
I don't want your money.

1478
01:21:25,502 --> 01:21:28,773
I don't wanna give it to you,

1479
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:33,812
but the Devil is not the
Devil unless he takes his due.

1480
01:21:36,781 --> 01:21:37,815
No hard feelings.

1481
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:39,417
Can I buy you a drink?

1482
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:40,452
Kinda early.

1483
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:41,286
Where?

1484
01:21:41,318 --> 01:21:41,952
You know where.

1485
01:21:41,986 --> 01:21:43,354
I'll see ya.

1486
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:45,756
Still hot.

1487
01:21:46,724 --> 01:21:47,559
Mr. Stern.

1488
01:21:48,826 --> 01:21:51,296
Can you explain what
just happened here?

1489
01:21:51,328 --> 01:21:54,498
Well, she admitted
that they did it,

1490
01:21:56,634 --> 01:21:58,770
and now they're gonna
fill in those ponds

1491
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:02,773
and they're gonna
clear Santi's name.

1492
01:22:02,806 --> 01:22:03,875
We settled.

1493
01:22:03,907 --> 01:22:05,442
What does she get?

1494
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:09,848
I don't know, and I
don't really wanna know.

1495
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,681
Yeah.

1496
01:22:11,849 --> 01:22:14,486
Ralph, hang on for a second.

1497
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:15,720
I got you somethin'.

1498
01:22:15,752 --> 01:22:17,054
Oh?

1499
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:25,729
For me?

1500
01:22:25,763 --> 01:22:26,730
You shouldn't have.

1501
01:22:26,764 --> 01:22:27,832
Well, maybe not.

1502
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:32,037
What's this,
the Eiffel Tower?

1503
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:33,404
Well, it was the closest thing

1504
01:22:33,438 --> 01:22:37,042
I could find that
looked like an oil rig.

1505
01:22:37,075 --> 01:22:39,711
I thought it'd make
a nice hood ornament

1506
01:22:39,743 --> 01:22:41,746
for your Ford Pinto.

1507
01:22:41,778 --> 01:22:43,848
It will indeed.

1508
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,349
Thank you, Fred.

1509
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,551
You're more than welcome.

1510
01:22:47,585 --> 01:22:50,956
Just sorry we couldn't
slay the big dragon.

1511
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:55,394
We tried, but we'll
always have Paris.

1512
01:22:56,493 --> 01:22:57,828
Yeah, I guess.

1513
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:02,033
Well, congratulations, Fred.

1514
01:23:02,065 --> 01:23:06,337
Mr. Stern, these
proceedings are concluded.

1515
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:07,505
It's been real.

1516
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:29,928
And my boy, what
happened there?

1517
01:23:29,961 --> 01:23:31,529
Hey girly,
you come to dance

1518
01:23:31,562 --> 01:23:33,398
with me in the pale moonlight?

1519
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:37,902
I've come to say goodbye.

1520
01:23:37,934 --> 01:23:39,603
Ah.

1521
01:23:39,636 --> 01:23:41,406
So you're leavin'.

1522
01:23:41,438 --> 01:23:43,075
Well, it's about time.

1523
01:23:44,474 --> 01:23:46,111
I'm gonna
settle with Stern.

1524
01:23:49,413 --> 01:23:50,748
Oh shit, Gigi.

1525
01:23:53,084 --> 01:23:54,719
You once gave me
some free advice.

1526
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:57,154
Yeah, what was that?

1527
01:23:57,188 --> 01:24:00,959
You get a shot at
salvation, you take it.

1528
01:24:01,925 --> 01:24:02,760
Right.

1529
01:24:05,696 --> 01:24:06,965
So this is your shot, huh?

1530
01:24:27,785 --> 01:24:28,886
Please don't.

1531
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,456
Fly now you piece of shit.

1532
01:24:37,094 --> 01:24:40,765
At Ezekiel 22:27,
we're told that princes

1533
01:24:40,797 --> 01:24:42,834
who tear up their victims,

1534
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:46,705
shedding blood, destroying
souls all for gain.

1535
01:24:47,938 --> 01:24:52,543
Your man fell free to such,
discovered and disgraced.

1536
01:24:52,577 --> 01:24:54,712
He didn't fight the inevitable.

1537
01:24:54,745 --> 01:24:58,683
He did the honorable thing
and exited the scene.

1538
01:24:58,715 --> 01:25:00,451
That guy was a pro.

1539
01:25:01,486 --> 01:25:02,787
Consummate.

1540
01:25:02,819 --> 01:25:05,456
What, so he just vanished?

1541
01:25:12,697 --> 01:25:14,599
I'm sure we'll
hear from him again.

1542
01:25:14,631 --> 01:25:15,899
At the end of the day,

1543
01:25:15,933 --> 01:25:18,470
having narrowly
escaped total disaster,

1544
01:25:18,502 --> 01:25:21,773
we ended our battle
with the Devil.

1545
01:25:21,805 --> 01:25:26,210
Suffering the insignificant
loss of 1% of his ask.

1546
01:25:30,848 --> 01:25:33,917
I believe, gentlemen,
you'll agree,

1547
01:25:37,654 --> 01:25:40,023
that $20,000,000 is
a small price to pay

1548
01:25:40,056 --> 01:25:43,929
to keep our good work
goin' and our souls intact.

1549
01:25:47,864 --> 01:25:50,268
So that's your story?

1550
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,769
It's a whopper.

1551
01:25:53,537 --> 01:25:56,139
If you like that kinda burger.

1552
01:25:56,172 --> 01:26:01,179
And what if we ask Alex
and all of their side of it?

1553
01:26:02,112 --> 01:26:03,080
Feel free to do so.

1554
01:26:04,047 --> 01:26:07,117
I have kept Olive on
as a legal consultant,

1555
01:26:07,151 --> 01:26:10,255
and Alex, he's on
location in Africa.

1556
01:26:12,023 --> 01:26:13,024
So you stabbed him in the back

1557
01:26:13,056 --> 01:26:14,959
and then you bought him off?

1558
01:26:14,992 --> 01:26:16,027
Respect.

1559
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:18,996
Well, it's a cryin'
shame that we can't hear

1560
01:26:19,029 --> 01:26:23,033
what our dearly departed
thought about all this.

1561
01:26:30,575 --> 01:26:32,076
But we can.

1562
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:41,853
Big Boss sent me.

1563
01:26:41,885 --> 01:26:42,720
Ruination.

1564
01:26:44,087 --> 01:26:47,325
What do you think this
whole case is for, huh?

1565
01:26:47,358 --> 01:26:49,727
Why do you think the
farmer's askin' for business?

1566
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,062
'Cause I made it so.

1567
01:26:51,095 --> 01:26:52,030
Me.

1568
01:27:32,202 --> 01:27:34,805
All right, gentlemen.

1569
01:27:38,975 --> 01:27:40,812
Let's talk about Iran.

1570
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:45,777
It's good to see you.

1571
01:28:58,755 --> 01:29:00,457
So what's the protocol?

1572
01:29:00,491 --> 01:29:02,359
Well, traditionally you have

1573
01:29:02,393 --> 01:29:05,663
to ask for permission
to come aboard.

1574
01:29:48,272 --> 01:29:49,940
Give me that thing.

1575
01:29:49,974 --> 01:29:52,276
This is your last
selfie you'll ever take.

1576
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:53,811
No!

1577
01:29:53,844 --> 01:29:55,179
Shit!

1578
01:29:55,211 --> 01:29:56,880
What, are you crazy?

1579
01:29:56,913 --> 01:29:58,014
Free at last.

1580
01:29:58,047 --> 01:30:00,184
You're free at least.

1581
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:06,998
Well that
ought to get it.

1582
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,501
I don't believe this.

1583
01:36:58,535 --> 01:37:00,703
We're in the middle of the
Great Pacific garbage patch.

1584
01:37:00,737 --> 01:37:02,672
You gotta be kiddin' me.

1585
01:37:02,706 --> 01:37:04,608
After all this, this
is where we end up.

1586
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,243
Don't look so
surprised, Mr. Water Bottles.

1587
01:37:07,277 --> 01:37:08,812
Oh, Santi.

1588
01:37:08,845 --> 01:37:09,813
Oh, look at us.

1589
01:37:09,845 --> 01:37:11,581
You know what?

1590
01:37:11,614 --> 01:37:12,815
I'm posting this one.

1591
01:37:12,849 --> 01:37:14,251
Oh, really?

1592
01:37:14,283 --> 01:37:17,688
And just how are you
going to do that, huh?

1593
