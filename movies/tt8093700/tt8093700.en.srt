2
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,701
Agojie! Agoj...

3
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,139
Agojie!

4
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,085
No!

5
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:27,806
Where are the prisoners?

6
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,573
Where are our people?

7
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:32,343
We are farmers. We took no one!

8
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:34,145
Miganon.

9
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:06,710
You will be home soon.

10
00:05:24,661 --> 00:05:26,697
Horses.

11
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:31,635
That can only mean Oyo soldiers.

12
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,416
Who is she?

13
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:48,620
My mother.

14
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,522
We will take you back
to your village.

15
00:05:50,654 --> 00:05:53,724
- Perhaps your father...
- They sold him.

16
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:56,727
And my brothers.

17
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,762
They sold them all.

18
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,914
Miganon.

19
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,917
The prisoners are ready
to march.

20
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:30,328
Bring me stronger warriors.

21
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:02,060
Thank you.

22
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,764
It doesn't matt... Nawi!

23
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,733
- Yeah?
- Tell your mother

24
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,569
to see me for the dress.

25
00:07:11,703 --> 00:07:13,571
What dress?

26
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:15,739
Your wedding dress.

27
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:18,276
I will make you beautiful.

28
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:19,644
Tell her.

29
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:22,213
They have made you
another match?

30
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:25,717
I don't know what
she's talking about.

31
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:28,620
They are coming.

32
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,855
Let's go.

33
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,796
Come here!

34
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:42,967
- Daughter! Come!
- My daughter!

35
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,737
My sister!

36
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,372
My sister!

37
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:48,806
Mother!

38
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,175
I'm so happy to see you.

39
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:26,077
- But I want to see.
- Shh!

40
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:30,081
The king does not allow us
to look upon the Agojie.

41
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:08,821
Nanisca.

42
00:09:08,953 --> 00:09:10,922
It is a victory.

43
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:13,257
They are here for you.

44
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:16,160
They do not know
an evil is coming.

45
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:20,531
They know you will protect them.

46
00:09:25,203 --> 00:09:27,071
I wish to speak to the king.

47
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,906
He's only seeing wives today.

48
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,109
Tell him. I will wait.

49
00:09:31,242 --> 00:09:33,177
The Agojie drink from the skulls

50
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,780
of the men they have killed.
- No.

51
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:37,348
They cut off their heads

52
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:40,853
and melt off their skin
in boiling hot cauldrons.

53
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:44,055
- Sister! Sister!
- Nawi.

54
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:45,990
- Hmm?
- We have a visitor.

55
00:09:46,124 --> 00:09:48,526
It's a rich man from Cana.

56
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,761
Come.

57
00:09:49,894 --> 00:09:52,096
Come.

58
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,199
Maybe he is handsome.

59
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,947
I own three fields
of palm trees.

60
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:12,417
You will work.

61
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:18,322
You do not talk to your husband?

62
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:24,562
In my house,
you will learn to obey.

63
00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:29,033
Nawi!

64
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:32,236
Forgive my daughter.

65
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,841
The whispers were right.

66
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:37,942
This...

67
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:40,311
girl is worthless.

68
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:44,015
Master Abade.

69
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,123
Come!

70
00:10:57,128 --> 00:11:00,965
I wish to give my daughter
to the king.

71
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:13,244
No husband will have her.

72
00:11:13,377 --> 00:11:16,147
I will not marry an old man
who beats me.

73
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,149
Go to war, then.

74
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:22,019
You will understand
what pain is.

75
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:27,258
Enter.

76
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:39,972
In the palace,
you do not have to look away.

77
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:43,608
Come.

78
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,855
Close your mouth.

79
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:58,656
You look like a fish.

80
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,671
What's in there?

81
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:16,008
Indigo dye.

82
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,010
Oh.

83
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:20,946
What did you think it was?

84
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,915
Heads.

85
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:25,082
No.

86
00:12:25,216 --> 00:12:27,218
Those are the heads.

87
00:12:27,351 --> 00:12:30,923
Some of the men
who raided our village.

88
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:34,058
The rest will be sold in Ouidah.

89
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:37,261
No men but the eunuchs
are allowed

90
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:39,163
in the palace after dark.

91
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:42,567
Beyond this wall,
this is a palace of women.

92
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,813
Come.

93
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:27,511
Hey.

94
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,549
Go and bathe yourselves.

95
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,228
Oyo, can you see this?

96
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:22,134
Your comrades murdered...

97
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:23,701
by women.

98
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:33,344
The Dahomey grow too bold
under their new king.

99
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:36,781
My loves.

100
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,350
My loves.

101
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:42,154
My love.

102
00:14:43,088 --> 00:14:45,389
My love.

103
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,627
Nanisca, come with me.

104
00:15:00,705 --> 00:15:03,307
Why does he always favor her?

105
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:07,445
She comes here filthy,
shows no respect.

106
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:10,082
She fought for him
during the coup.

107
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:11,850
Put him on the throne.

108
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:14,251
What did you do?

109
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:17,254
Locked yourself in a cupboard.

110
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:25,463
The Oyo have entered our land.

111
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:29,300
They have broken the peace.

112
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,104
When they come for the tribute,

113
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:33,905
we will not pay it.

114
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,921
- But that would mean war.
- Migan, we have been

115
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:40,277
under the foot of the Oyo
since my father's time.

116
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,780
Are you not tired? Eh?

117
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:46,317
Oh, because we...
we fear their might.

118
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:48,887
Because of fear.

119
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,191
My king, they are a nation
twice our size,

120
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,792
with horses and more muskets.

121
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:58,096
We need time to plan
and prepare our armies.

122
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,630
The Agojie are ready.

123
00:15:59,764 --> 00:16:02,299
How many did you lose
in this last battle

124
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,336
against the lowly Mahi?

125
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:09,473
My king, I hear whispers
of a new general.

126
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:12,878
This last attack
was sword rattling.

127
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:14,246
Nothing more.

128
00:16:14,378 --> 00:16:15,579
I agree.

129
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,215
Dahomey has prospered
in the peace.

130
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:18,682
And the Oyo, too.

131
00:16:18,817 --> 00:16:22,220
The slave trade
is the reason we prosper.

132
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:23,554
But at what price?

133
00:16:23,687 --> 00:16:26,323
It is a poison
slowly killing us,

134
00:16:26,457 --> 00:16:27,859
and the Europeans know this.

135
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:30,628
They come to our land
for their human cargo.

136
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,296
They've come to trade.

137
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:33,798
We sell them what they want.

138
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,201
But why do we sell our captives?

139
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,003
For weapons?

140
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,571
To capture more people
to sell for more weapons?

141
00:16:40,704 --> 00:16:44,176
It is a dark circle with no end.

142
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:46,178
This is not the way.

143
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,113
The spirits have spoken.

144
00:16:48,246 --> 00:16:50,015
Ifá seeks light.

145
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:53,450
So, what do you suggest,
Nanisca?

146
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:56,288
We have other things to sell.

147
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,521
Gold. Palm oil.

148
00:16:57,655 --> 00:16:59,124
We can double our harvest.

149
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:01,325
She wants to make us
a nation of peasants.

150
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:03,962
I want Dahomey to survive.

151
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,100
The gods have brought us
a new king.

152
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,303
A king to be feared.

153
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:12,770
No one fears a farmer.

154
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:17,341
We have already started
to gather the tribute.

155
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:20,644
Perhaps we pay, to buy us time.

156
00:17:24,448 --> 00:17:26,517
I promise...

157
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,821
this will be our last.

158
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:34,592
As for the palm oil,
Nanisca, show me.

159
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:38,596
Show me how much you can
produce, and we will see.

160
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:52,244
You speak in secret to the king.

161
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:54,112
You seek to cut me out.

162
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:56,380
If the king respects me,

163
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:59,017
it is because I have earned it.

164
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,389
Gboje.

165
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:08,860
I am Amenza.

166
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:12,163
You come to the palace of Ghezo,

167
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:14,665
the ninth monarch
of the Dahomey people,

168
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,336
descendants of
the leopard Agasu,

169
00:18:18,469 --> 00:18:23,842
beloved of the twin gods,
Mawu and her brother Lisa.

170
00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:27,879
You are called to join
the King's Guard.

171
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:35,988
We fight...

172
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,155
or we die.

173
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,763
We fight for Dahomey,

174
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:46,899
for our sisters,

175
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:49,066
for our great king.

176
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,069
You will be revered.

177
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,008
You will be paid for your work.

178
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,743
Your opinions will be heard.

179
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:02,246
No tribe or kingdom
in all of Africa

180
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,082
shares this privilege.

181
00:19:05,216 --> 00:19:06,552
For this honor,

182
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:10,789
we live out our lives
in these palace walls.

183
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:15,928
We take no husband.

184
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,664
We will bear no children.

185
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,632
Mahi women,

186
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:23,602
no harm will come to you
for the sins of your men.

187
00:19:23,735 --> 00:19:27,539
I offer you and our people
a choice.

188
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:32,744
Any woman who does not wish
to stay...

189
00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,847
may leave.

190
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:02,741
I can't continue with this one.

191
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:05,010
You're talking vodun.
You don't want to listen.

192
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:06,478
No, you want to laugh.

193
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,950
Do not touch
another warrior's weapon.

194
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:15,219
Mm. Especially that one.

195
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:17,188
It is cursed.

196
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:20,391
Esi couldn't hit an elephant
in a stampede.

197
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,027
Turn your back and see

198
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,763
how true my aim is.
- Ah, me?

199
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,198
Mm.

200
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,441
Spent all my liberties
walking the river

201
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:39,111
till I found
the perfect whetstone.

202
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:42,146
Shaped smooth by the waterfall.

203
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,549
Sharpens to a thorn.

204
00:20:46,384 --> 00:20:49,220
Pop out their eyeballs,
fight is over.

205
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:55,159
They are also useful in keeping
the trainees in line.

206
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:56,495
Why have you not bathed?

207
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,195
You are going to bring
the buzzards.

208
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:00,799
- I let the others go before me.
- Ah.

209
00:21:00,932 --> 00:21:04,102
The first rule of training:

210
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:07,338
always obey Izogie.

211
00:21:10,207 --> 00:21:13,310
I am Izogie.

212
00:21:37,803 --> 00:21:39,872
I'm sorry.

213
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:43,175
You may stay.

214
00:21:43,308 --> 00:21:46,010
You are one of
the captives we freed?

215
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:48,113
No. My father brought me.

216
00:21:48,247 --> 00:21:49,947
As a gift to the king.

217
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,684
Is your father rich?

218
00:21:52,818 --> 00:21:54,286
He must be.

219
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,921
Otherwise, he would have
sold you to a rich husband.

220
00:21:57,054 --> 00:21:58,990
He tried.

221
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:01,827
I do not want a husband.

222
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:03,295
I want to be a soldier.

223
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,898
- An Agojie.
- How old are you?

224
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,633
I have 19 years.

225
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,000
You look like a child.

226
00:22:09,134 --> 00:22:10,869
I work hard.

227
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:12,571
Harder than anyone.

228
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:15,973
Many obstinate daughters
are dumped at the palace.

229
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:18,544
They usually fail.

230
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:21,580
All our lives, they...

231
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:24,616
they tell us stories
about the Agojie.

232
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,218
That you have magic.

233
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:30,222
You look like
a regular old woman to me.

234
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:37,262
Fighting is not magic.

235
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:39,765
It is skill.

236
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:43,034
We will see if you have any.

237
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:59,083
I am not a soldier.

238
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:02,086
Then why did you stay?

239
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,490
I have nowhere else to go.

240
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:08,894
You are Mahi.

241
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:10,295
Why did you stay?

242
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,700
Here, I will be the hunter,
not prey.

243
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,456
Today, you are receiving
your first weapon.

244
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:53,037
Not good.

245
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:57,543
Ah, good.

246
00:24:01,747 --> 00:24:02,781
Again.

247
00:24:04,081 --> 00:24:05,784
A rope is not a weapon.

248
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:10,155
You wish for a different weapon?

249
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:13,292
Stand up.

250
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,530
Go. Attack the soldier.
Take his head.

251
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:26,138
- I apologize.
- Do not apologize. Do it.

252
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:59,137
I'd work on that rope.

253
00:25:04,977 --> 00:25:07,312
Hey. Tsetse.

254
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:09,915
Who's Tsetse?

255
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:11,383
You, little fly.

256
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:14,486
Buzzing around full speed.

257
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,989
But you don't know
where you are going.

258
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:19,124
We need smart warriors.

259
00:25:19,257 --> 00:25:20,125
The dumb ones die quickly.

260
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:21,960
I'm not dumb.

261
00:25:22,094 --> 00:25:23,161
-Then show me.

262
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:25,097
You have to train different.

263
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,532
The drills are a game.

264
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,302
It is play,
like when you were a child.

265
00:25:30,435 --> 00:25:33,106
I was not allowed to play.

266
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,773
I was made to work.

267
00:25:34,906 --> 00:25:37,075
Such a sad tale.

268
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,810
You don't know anything.

269
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:49,521
You know, when I had 14 years,

270
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:53,291
my mother put a sign out
to sell my virginity.

271
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,894
The first man came,

272
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:59,364
and I cried for my mother,
but she didn't come.

273
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:03,136
The second man came
and complained of my tears,

274
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:04,736
so she beat me.

275
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:09,508
The third man came,
and I burned him with an ember.

276
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:15,347
Your family was cruel,

277
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,350
as was my mother.

278
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:21,486
It is enough to make you cry.

279
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:25,524
But it is better to laugh. Yes?

280
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,895
You have a new family now.

281
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,069
Trainees, we will prepare you

282
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:38,670
for the final test.

283
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:41,907
You will perform your
battle skills before the king.

284
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:45,911
Those who pass the test

285
00:26:46,044 --> 00:26:47,446
will become Agojie.

286
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,117
And those who fail
will leave the palace,

287
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,350
never to return.

288
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:59,691
Hey, look at you.
The Oyo will catch you,

289
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:02,360
hang you by your feet
and cut your throat.

290
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,464
Use your feet and walk!

291
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:27,385
Get up.
You are just waiting to die.

292
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:33,391
Are we training to cook?

293
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:37,163
You are cutting a body,
not a yam.

294
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:39,731
Swing with purpose.

295
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:50,709
Ready. Fire!

296
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,783
Good, Ode.

297
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,485
- Get out!
- Nawi, you move like a sloth.

298
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,793
That's right.

299
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:12,964
Dahomey!

300
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:18,303
Izogie!

301
00:28:50,001 --> 00:28:54,339
Agojie!

302
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:04,683
Fumbe.

303
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:07,352
Show me how to tie the rope.

304
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,654
Never.

305
00:29:09,788 --> 00:29:12,325
It is the only thing
I can do better than you.

306
00:29:12,457 --> 00:29:15,328
Ode, this one.

307
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:20,333
But did you see Izogie?

308
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,467
With the dagger here.

309
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:25,338
She's standing there,
not moving, not in pain.

310
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,405
- Wow.
- I love it.

311
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,374
I'm going to be like her.

312
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:30,507
Yes, my friend.

313
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:31,910
- As strong as her.
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:29:32,043 --> 00:29:34,146
You try to stab me,
I'll stab you back.

315
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,414
Yeah.

316
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:38,017
Backswing.

317
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,035
Which of you designed
this trick?

318
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:00,472
Hmm?

319
00:30:00,605 --> 00:30:03,142
- Then you will all be punished.
- I did it.

320
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:05,577
- We all did it.
- No.

321
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:08,147
It was me.

322
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:09,347
I apologize.

323
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:11,983
Once again.

324
00:30:13,418 --> 00:30:15,453
Go back to the barracks.

325
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:23,929
How do you make this explosion?

326
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:28,333
You do not need guns
to use gunpowder.

327
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,468
We just need a spark.

328
00:30:31,403 --> 00:30:33,972
You like the guns?

329
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:36,541
Do you enjoy practicing
with the men in the infantry?

330
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:39,678
I see you flirting.

331
00:30:39,811 --> 00:30:42,014
- This is not allowed?
- You know it is not.

332
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:43,515
Why not?

333
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:46,351
The men who are soldiers
have wives and children,

334
00:30:46,484 --> 00:30:48,221
but the Agojie cannot.

335
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:49,788
How is that fair?

336
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,656
Were you this arrogant
with your family?

337
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,425
No wonder they gave you away.

338
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:56,095
It is you who is arrogant.

339
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,298
I am a general.

340
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:00,498
I have earned it.

341
00:31:00,632 --> 00:31:02,335
You have earned nothing.

342
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:03,602
I should put you out.

343
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:05,370
- No.
- I have watched soldiers die

344
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:07,606
because they did not
have discipline.

345
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:09,342
Their easy life
did not prepare them for

346
00:31:09,474 --> 00:31:13,445
- this life here as an Agojie.
- I did not have an easy life.

347
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:18,184
I did not have an easy life.

348
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:19,517
Please.

349
00:31:19,651 --> 00:31:21,453
I-I want to be here
with the others.

350
00:31:21,586 --> 00:31:23,688
I want to fight for my king.

351
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:27,459
Please.

352
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:31,963
Your tears mean nothing.

353
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,902
To be a warrior,
you must kill your tears.

354
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:46,012
Go.

355
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:48,647
Ah.

356
00:31:56,988 --> 00:31:58,957
Go.

357
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:07,066
Hey.

358
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
You are a Mahi prisoner.

359
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:11,404
That is all you will ever be.

360
00:32:11,536 --> 00:32:13,838
What did you say?

361
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:16,375
- She killed our people.
- You killed mine.

362
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:19,511
Me, I also came here a captive.

363
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:22,381
Do you think yourself
better than me?

364
00:32:22,514 --> 00:32:23,615
No, Ajahi.

365
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:26,085
If you make it
through the final test,

366
00:32:26,218 --> 00:32:28,520
you are one of us.

367
00:32:28,653 --> 00:32:31,556
No matter where you come from.

368
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,562
Hmm.

369
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:44,337
Hey, Tsetse.

370
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:45,470
Eat up.

371
00:32:45,603 --> 00:32:48,740
Nanisca favors the strong.

372
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:51,843
What is the first rule
of training?

373
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:59,151
Always obey Izogie.

374
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:05,490
Come with me.

375
00:33:09,095 --> 00:33:11,130
Drink.

376
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:12,664
What is it?

377
00:33:12,797 --> 00:33:15,567
The only thing the white men
bring worth having.

378
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,371
They call it whiskey.

379
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:23,875
There. We finally found
a way to quiet Tse.

380
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,543
You know your tongue
will get you

381
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,545
kicked back to your village.

382
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,848
Why do you challenge
the miganon?

383
00:33:29,981 --> 00:33:32,018
If I'm quiet, she won't see me.

384
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:34,719
Do you think she
has time to think about you?

385
00:33:34,853 --> 00:33:38,623
She is thinking about the world.

386
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:41,526
You know she may one day
be the kpojito.

387
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:43,595
- The woman king?
- Mm-hmm.

388
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:46,564
But we have not had one
in so many years.

389
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,666
His brother did not honor it,

390
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,537
but King Ghezo believes
in tradition.

391
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,509
In the twin gods, Mawu and Lisa.

392
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,543
Woman and man.

393
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:00,413
Equal.

394
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:02,580
Ghezo will name a woman king.

395
00:34:02,714 --> 00:34:05,484
For the gods and the people.

396
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:08,521
But is that what
the miganon wants?

397
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:10,523
I cannot say.

398
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:13,825
But in the palace,
she is a legend.

399
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,561
Captured as a young soldier.

400
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:18,563
Given up for dead.

401
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,765
But she returned,

402
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:25,538
with the Oyo bastards' kofes
hanging by her belt.

403
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,531
You know I hate that drink.

404
00:34:52,664 --> 00:34:55,534
The king drinks
anything I give him.

405
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:56,901
The king is young.

406
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:59,637
He brings that silly wife
to the council.

407
00:34:59,771 --> 00:35:01,906
Shante.

408
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:06,845
Ah, she is ambitious, hmm?

409
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,055
Tell me the dream, Nani.

410
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:24,697
It dispels its magic
if you say the words.

411
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:29,969
I am in the jungle.

412
00:35:30,102 --> 00:35:32,170
Mm-hmm.

413
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:38,110
Something is out there,
in the darkness.

414
00:35:40,078 --> 00:35:40,947
A beast.

415
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,315
Angry.

416
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:50,456
I can smell its sweat, its fear.

417
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,593
What does the beast look like?

418
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:56,295
I don't know.

419
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:59,197
That is when I wake.

420
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:02,835
The dream is a warning, no?

421
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:06,104
We must ask Legba.

422
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:08,240
Oh, no. Not the nuts.

423
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:11,010
Do not call them nuts.

424
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:15,080
They are sacred.

425
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:26,059
You have enemies gathering.

426
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,794
You must do better than that.

427
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:33,499
I see fire.

428
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:39,072
Something or someone
from your past.

429
00:36:39,204 --> 00:36:41,975
This is nonsense.

430
00:36:42,107 --> 00:36:43,443
And your medicine, too.

431
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,112
- I am not even tired.
- Go to the altar.

432
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:50,349
Leave gifts for the dead.

433
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:54,787
Do it.

434
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:59,626
If you do not respect Ifá,
respect your own dream.

435
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:26,338
I am General Oba Ade.

436
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:36,616
The esteemed regard
of the king of Oyo.

437
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:41,521
Gifts for the Oyo Kingdom,
as is tradition.

438
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:44,423
Nanisca.

439
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,442
This is less than ever before.

440
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:55,501
Did you think we would not see?

441
00:39:55,635 --> 00:39:57,270
Did you think we would
not see your hand

442
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:59,472
in the raid of our village?

443
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:03,543
To make up for
your shortcomings,

444
00:40:03,676 --> 00:40:06,311
I will accept an addition
to the tribute.

445
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,080
40 Agojie.

446
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,685
Not too old.

447
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,722
- And if I refuse?
- Then you may no longer

448
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:18,336
use the port in Ouidah
for your trade.

449
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,226
The port belongs to Dahomey.

450
00:40:20,358 --> 00:40:22,360
We have taken control.

451
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:24,096
It belongs to us now.

452
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,270
I'm so surprised you brought
your horses here to plateau.

453
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,439
If they are bitten by the flies,

454
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:37,043
they may get
the sleeping sickness.

455
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:41,346
Sometimes a mouse
can take down an elephant.

456
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,516
Do you threaten the Oyo,
usurper?

457
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,651
You will respect the king.

458
00:40:47,553 --> 00:40:49,387
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Migan.

459
00:40:49,522 --> 00:40:51,457
This new general seeks
to bait us.

460
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:54,126
We won't jump
at his foolishness.

461
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,394
Let us talk.

462
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,081
20 Agojie of our choosing.

463
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:18,551
We will march them to Ouidah
and surrender them.

464
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,987
And the port remains open
for our trade.

465
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:23,656
I will leave Boma

466
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:25,658
to enjoy the feast
that you have prepared.

467
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:29,929
In Ouidah, I will be waiting.

468
00:41:30,997 --> 00:41:32,131
Oba.

469
00:42:58,317 --> 00:42:59,785
Nanisca.

470
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:03,689
What happened?

471
00:43:03,823 --> 00:43:07,126
Your nuts were finally right.

472
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:00,940
Agojie.

473
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,742
Agojie's here.

474
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,484
Hey, a deal's a deal!

475
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,013
We bring tribute
from King Ghezo.

476
00:45:41,147 --> 00:45:44,551
Dahomey has no soldiers
man enough.

477
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:47,653
They have to use their women.

478
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:50,256
It is against the gods.

479
00:45:51,891 --> 00:45:54,561
My men will find plenty
of use for them.

480
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:56,829
You're mistaken.

481
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,698
These soldiers
are not your tribute.

482
00:45:59,832 --> 00:46:02,134
This is your tribute.

483
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,405
Let it be known to all

484
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:10,009
The great and mighty King Ghezo
fears no one.

485
00:46:20,886 --> 00:46:24,390
- Oyo!
- Oyo!

486
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,729
Li-Lift the gate!

487
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:20,346
Miganon!

488
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,681
Go!

489
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,489
Go! Go!

490
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,834
Push off.

491
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,712
Why did you not follow the plan?

492
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:27,448
You were to go to the boats.

493
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:28,748
The soldiers were coming.

494
00:48:28,882 --> 00:48:30,585
If I did not come back
as I did...

495
00:48:30,717 --> 00:48:32,085
So you are the hero?

496
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,155
You can act on your own,
ignoring orders?

497
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:38,392
- You would not have escaped.
- Nawi.

498
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:45,399
It is you who faced capture
by disobeying my orders.

499
00:48:50,538 --> 00:48:52,507
We are Agojie.

500
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,007
We do not act alone.

501
00:48:54,141 --> 00:48:56,310
We move together
with one purpose.

502
00:48:56,444 --> 00:48:57,944
Alone, you are weak.

503
00:48:58,078 --> 00:49:00,847
Alone, you are killed or worse.

504
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:04,684
Now you have seen
the barracoons.

505
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:07,787
A captured Agojie is a slave.

506
00:49:08,722 --> 00:49:10,491
Used by men.

507
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:12,859
Left to rot.

508
00:49:14,562 --> 00:49:17,565
It is better to die.

509
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:19,699
Cut your own throat.

510
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,210
I will never question you
in front of the others,

511
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,745
but it is you who did not
follow the plan.

512
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:34,848
I only ever had one plan,
Amenza.

513
00:49:34,981 --> 00:49:36,584
To take his head.

514
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:39,019
Nanisca, I...

515
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:05,413
Nanisca.

516
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:06,913
Come in.

517
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:14,455
I hear you have had a victory.

518
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:21,061
Nanisca, I think we have
started on a wrong foot.

519
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:23,297
I wish to be your friend.

520
00:50:23,431 --> 00:50:25,966
I can help you.
I have the king's ear.

521
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,934
We should work together
to serve our king.

522
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,103
To ensure he grows
only more powerful.

523
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:33,139
It is you who wants
to be powerful.

524
00:50:33,274 --> 00:50:37,811
To stay safe and rich
in your fine palace.

525
00:50:39,347 --> 00:50:41,982
Too much change
can be dangerous.

526
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:44,518
I have said this much
to my husband.

527
00:50:44,652 --> 00:50:49,189
Then we will soon understand
who truly has his ear.

528
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:08,209
This field alone produces

529
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:10,810
thousands of barrels
of palm oil.

530
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:13,347
If we harvest many fields
each year,

531
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:16,550
we will have a continuous
supply to trade.

532
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:17,784
Hmm.

533
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:21,054
I never saw a path before,
Nanisca.

534
00:51:22,088 --> 00:51:23,724
But look at this.

535
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,326
Now I do.

536
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:28,928
Vision is seeing
what others do not.

537
00:51:29,062 --> 00:51:30,964
But now we have declared war.

538
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:33,701
We will conquer the Oyo,

539
00:51:33,833 --> 00:51:36,404
and we will expand our land.

540
00:51:36,537 --> 00:51:39,473
Nanisca, we will be
the greatest empire in Africa.

541
00:51:39,607 --> 00:51:42,842
Yes, my king,
but let us not be an empire

542
00:51:42,976 --> 00:51:45,145
who sells its people.

543
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,847
Let us be an empire
who loves its people.

544
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:50,884
My brother sold our own.

545
00:51:51,017 --> 00:51:52,620
I will never do that.

546
00:51:52,753 --> 00:51:57,658
Even if they are not Dahomey,
they are still our people.

547
00:51:57,792 --> 00:52:00,528
The white man has brought
immorality here.

548
00:52:00,661 --> 00:52:02,929
They will not stop
until the whole of Africa

549
00:52:03,063 --> 00:52:05,232
is theirs to enslave.

550
00:52:05,932 --> 00:52:07,735
Go.

551
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,743
The English navy
now patrols the waters,

552
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,645
attacks and removes our cargo.

553
00:52:17,778 --> 00:52:20,514
Your tribal warfare
is none of my concern.

554
00:52:20,648 --> 00:52:22,949
And yours with Dahomey
is none of ours.

555
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:26,253
It will be over soon enough.

556
00:52:26,387 --> 00:52:29,357
The Mahi, the Igbo,
they are with us.

557
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,727
By the full moon,
we will march on their city,

558
00:52:32,859 --> 00:52:34,194
and we will take it.

559
00:52:34,328 --> 00:52:37,097
Ouidah is open for business.

560
00:52:37,231 --> 00:52:39,165
You will have your cargo.

561
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:45,960
Go back to Ouidah, slaver.

562
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:48,929
Naked like the people you sell.

563
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:50,163
I am not a slaver.

564
00:54:50,297 --> 00:54:52,065
You understand me?

565
00:54:52,198 --> 00:54:55,201
My mother was Dahomey.

566
00:54:56,202 --> 00:54:58,137
You do not look like Dahomey.

567
00:54:58,272 --> 00:55:01,909
My father is white.

568
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:05,346
So you are Dahomey but not.

569
00:55:06,045 --> 00:55:07,681
And white...

570
00:55:07,815 --> 00:55:10,317
but not.

571
00:55:12,486 --> 00:55:15,789
You think I could
have my pants now?

572
00:55:21,127 --> 00:55:24,030
I saw you in Ouidah.

573
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:26,065
Why are you here in the jungle?

574
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:29,003
I am going to Dahomey.

575
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:32,640
The place my mother told me
so much about.

576
00:55:32,773 --> 00:55:36,075
Perhaps I will
see you there, too.

577
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,045
If you are allowed
into the palace.

578
00:56:04,204 --> 00:56:06,273
I am Malik.

579
00:56:07,173 --> 00:56:09,108
Malik!

580
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:30,931
I do not like
this young captain.

581
00:56:31,065 --> 00:56:33,033
Puffed up like a banty rooster.

582
00:56:33,166 --> 00:56:34,301
Finally, we agree.

583
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:49,182
So you are now a captain, eh?

584
00:56:49,316 --> 00:56:50,384
<i>- Si.</i>
- Very good.

585
00:56:55,489 --> 00:56:57,491
Well done.

586
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,734
You have my thanks.

587
00:57:17,211 --> 00:57:20,047
My mother was also taken.

588
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:22,449
Sold by my brother.

589
00:57:22,583 --> 00:57:25,019
I have many men in your country
searching for her,

590
00:57:25,151 --> 00:57:27,087
and they will bring her back.

591
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:28,822
It is a must.

592
00:57:28,956 --> 00:57:32,059
And, uh, if they find
your mother,

593
00:57:32,191 --> 00:57:34,094
they will bring her back, too.

594
00:57:34,228 --> 00:57:35,896
I have just buried her.

595
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,333
It was her dying wish
that I come to her home.

596
00:57:39,466 --> 00:57:41,669
The only place
she was ever free.

597
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,972
This is your home.

598
00:57:45,105 --> 00:57:47,107
It is yours, eh?

599
00:57:47,241 --> 00:57:49,910
And you came on the right day.

600
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:51,345
Our magnificent Agojie,

601
00:57:51,478 --> 00:57:53,179
they are doing their final test.

602
00:57:53,313 --> 00:57:55,215
So please sit, eh?

603
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:57,183
Go. Go on, sit. Go.

604
00:57:57,317 --> 00:57:59,720
Prepare the seats for them.

605
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:04,591
Very good.

606
00:58:05,292 --> 00:58:06,727
Let us begin.

607
00:58:11,265 --> 00:58:12,800
Go.

608
00:58:32,052 --> 00:58:33,787
Fear not.

609
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:35,355
Face it head-on.

610
00:58:35,489 --> 00:58:38,292
Relentlessly, we will fight.

611
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:12,159
Fumbe.

612
00:59:16,363 --> 00:59:19,833
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Come!

613
00:59:22,636 --> 00:59:25,139
Come. Come. Come.

614
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:26,974
Come.

615
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:29,009
Come. Come.

616
00:59:29,143 --> 00:59:30,245
Come.

617
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:11,919
Yeah!

618
01:00:45,786 --> 01:00:49,324
Yeah!

619
01:00:57,931 --> 01:01:00,400
Come.
Come, come, come, come, come.

620
01:01:00,534 --> 01:01:02,469
Come, my dear.
Come, come, come.

621
01:01:07,407 --> 01:01:08,475
What is your name?

622
01:01:08,609 --> 01:01:10,043
I am Nawi, my king.

623
01:01:10,177 --> 01:01:11,378
Nawi.

624
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:13,847
You are beautiful
as you are fierce.

625
01:01:15,182 --> 01:01:16,917
If she was not so skilled,
I would have

626
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,653
made her a wife, now.

627
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:25,092
To the victor!

628
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:32,866
The gods will bless you.
The gods will keep you safe.

629
01:01:38,505 --> 01:01:40,607
Well done to all of you.

630
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:44,279
You are the strongest
warriors in Africa.

631
01:01:44,411 --> 01:01:46,314
Welcome to the King's Guard.

632
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:00,694
Agojie!

633
01:02:00,827 --> 01:02:02,397
- Wu Suu!
- Agojie!

634
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:04,299
- Wu Suu!
- Agojie!

635
01:02:04,431 --> 01:02:06,334
Wu Suu!

636
01:02:10,704 --> 01:02:13,807
Hey, be still.

637
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:17,511
Thank you.

638
01:02:17,644 --> 01:02:20,248
Why did you return
to help Fumbe?

639
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:21,448
You could have lost.

640
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:23,251
Fumbe is my friend.

641
01:02:23,384 --> 01:02:24,451
I want her to stay.

642
01:02:24,584 --> 01:02:26,453
To stay, she must pass the test.

643
01:02:26,586 --> 01:02:29,923
To be useful,
she must stand on her own.

644
01:02:31,825 --> 01:02:33,927
You would not help
your friend, Miganon?

645
01:02:34,061 --> 01:02:35,095
Amenza?

646
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:38,732
I would step on her head
to win a footrace.

647
01:02:42,602 --> 01:02:44,339
Ah, your first scars.

648
01:02:44,471 --> 01:02:46,606
The mark of a warrior.

649
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:49,410
You see?

650
01:02:49,543 --> 01:02:51,478
Hmm?

651
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:54,047
You will have many more.

652
01:02:57,017 --> 01:02:58,151
Hmm?

653
01:02:59,287 --> 01:03:00,988
Hmm?

654
01:03:04,425 --> 01:03:06,493
Make sure...

655
01:03:06,626 --> 01:03:08,296
all the thorns come out.

656
01:03:08,429 --> 01:03:09,496
Here, here.

657
01:03:09,629 --> 01:03:11,164
- Mm-hmm.
- Here.

658
01:03:11,299 --> 01:03:12,400
Mm-hmm.

659
01:03:12,532 --> 01:03:14,302
Here.

660
01:03:14,435 --> 01:03:16,837
What is this?

661
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:21,074
Uh, my father used to call it
the devil's mark.

662
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:24,778
It was there when he chose me
from the orphanage.

663
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:27,714
You are an orphan?

664
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,452
But your father...

665
01:03:31,585 --> 01:03:33,153
He took me in.

666
01:03:33,287 --> 01:03:36,523
I guess I didn't turn out
to be the daughter he wanted.

667
01:03:59,613 --> 01:04:01,282
Nani?

668
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:10,057
- What did you do with it?
- With what?

669
01:04:16,596 --> 01:04:17,831
You told me never to tell you.

670
01:04:17,964 --> 01:04:20,567
- I'm asking.
- You said you would ask,

671
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,636
- and you made me swear.
- Amenza!

672
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:28,276
I am not your servant, Nanisca.

673
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,021
I gave her to the missionaries.

674
01:04:41,154 --> 01:04:43,233
- What missionaries?
- The ones we passed on the road

675
01:04:43,257 --> 01:04:45,134
when we were marching.
- Where did they take her?

676
01:04:45,158 --> 01:04:47,528
- I have no way to know that.
- What direction did they go?

677
01:04:47,661 --> 01:04:50,498
I followed your order...

678
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,468
To free you of the burden...

679
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,602
And I chose to give her away.

680
01:04:55,735 --> 01:04:57,405
- And that is all you know?
- Yes!

681
01:04:57,538 --> 01:04:59,172
I do not lie to you.

682
01:05:01,174 --> 01:05:05,346
Why do you ask these questions
after all this time?

683
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:11,385
Because Nawi is an orphan?

684
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:17,291
You couldn't possibly think
that sh-she...

685
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:22,296
Of course not.

686
01:05:23,464 --> 01:05:25,165
No.

687
01:05:35,709 --> 01:05:39,347
The gods are not that cruel.

688
01:05:47,388 --> 01:05:50,757
Speak my language
when you are in my palace.

689
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:54,094
Your wife Shante,

690
01:05:54,228 --> 01:05:57,164
she said you seek
an end to the trade.

691
01:05:58,698 --> 01:06:00,434
She does not speak for me.

692
01:06:00,568 --> 01:06:03,670
And she will be punished
for thinking she does.

693
01:06:05,105 --> 01:06:07,508
She says this is
your general's wish

694
01:06:07,642 --> 01:06:08,675
and perhaps not yours.

695
01:06:08,808 --> 01:06:11,011
My generals obey my wishes.

696
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:14,714
So you wish to sell...
palm oil.

697
01:06:14,848 --> 01:06:17,585
I wish for my people to prosper,

698
01:06:17,717 --> 01:06:19,052
as those of your land do.

699
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:22,889
Ghezo, the people in my lands
prosper

700
01:06:23,023 --> 01:06:26,092
because of the slave trade.

701
01:06:26,227 --> 01:06:28,929
And this very same trade
has made you rich.

702
01:06:29,062 --> 01:06:32,933
As rich as the king of England.

703
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:37,672
You stop the trade,
you will be nothing.

704
01:06:37,804 --> 01:06:40,308
King, maybe, but...

705
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:41,942
king of mud.

706
01:06:42,075 --> 01:06:45,812
All of these captains will take
their business elsewhere.

707
01:06:45,946 --> 01:06:49,149
The business
of selling Africans?

708
01:06:50,518 --> 01:06:53,019
You will be unprotected.

709
01:06:53,753 --> 01:06:56,490
Unprotected?

710
01:06:57,824 --> 01:07:00,628
Ooh.

711
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,430
You know, I am under no illusion

712
01:07:02,563 --> 01:07:07,401
that you see us
as anything but a commodity.

713
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:12,839
But I am a king.

714
01:07:12,973 --> 01:07:16,444
With or without your respect.

715
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:21,649
And if you are no longer
a necessity to me,

716
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:25,785
you, too, are unprotected.

717
01:07:30,857 --> 01:07:32,526
Yeah!

718
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:46,240
Malik.

719
01:07:49,744 --> 01:07:51,679
Nawi.

720
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:53,980
- May I come in?
- No.

721
01:07:54,114 --> 01:07:56,983
No man may cross the palm line.

722
01:07:57,117 --> 01:07:59,953
In Brazil, foreign men may look
on the king's women?

723
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:03,624
In Brazil,
women cover their bodies

724
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:06,026
with long sleeves, long skirts.

725
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:08,429
Then how do they run?

726
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:13,833
Yes? Make sure that...

727
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:16,570
We make camp
outside the walls tonight.

728
01:08:16,704 --> 01:08:17,705
Come to see me.

729
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:20,374
Tonight, we take our blood oath.

730
01:08:20,508 --> 01:08:22,376
Afterward.

731
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:25,011
If you wish for a girl
to come to your tent,

732
01:08:25,145 --> 01:08:26,785
there are girls
you can pay in the market.

733
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:30,950
No, no, I-I just want
to talk to you.

734
01:08:31,084 --> 01:08:33,853
Malik!

735
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:39,493
Will you come to see me?

736
01:09:28,675 --> 01:09:30,444
Agojie!

737
01:09:31,745 --> 01:09:33,548
Blood of our sisters.

738
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:37,250
♪ Make us invincible ♪

739
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:41,121
♪ You live for me ♪

740
01:09:42,524 --> 01:09:44,191
♪ And I for you ♪

741
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:47,896
♪ Blood of our sisters ♪

742
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:50,999
♪ Make us invincible ♪

743
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:58,106
♪ You live for me
and I for you ♪

744
01:09:59,774 --> 01:10:01,341
♪ You live for me
and I for you ♪

745
01:10:01,475 --> 01:10:04,012
♪ Agojie ♪

746
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:11,251
You are now my sister.

747
01:10:11,385 --> 01:10:13,922
I will be proud
to fight with you.

748
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:15,557
I want you to teach me.

749
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:17,759
Like the miganon teaches you.

750
01:10:17,892 --> 01:10:21,196
I also want to be great.

751
01:10:21,328 --> 01:10:24,632
To be great, you must focus.

752
01:10:24,766 --> 01:10:27,102
There can be no distractions.

753
01:10:27,234 --> 01:10:28,570
I will.

754
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:35,476
At the test, I saw the man
from Brazil wave to you.

755
01:10:36,343 --> 01:10:38,312
You know this man?

756
01:10:38,445 --> 01:10:42,217
I... I came across him
in the jungle.

757
01:10:42,349 --> 01:10:44,886
"In the jungle."

758
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:48,757
So, what,
you have feelings for him?

759
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:52,660
I have no way to know
how I feel about him.

760
01:10:54,328 --> 01:10:56,430
You want me to teach you.

761
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:02,503
You are powerful.

762
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:05,140
More than you even know.

763
01:11:05,272 --> 01:11:08,042
Do not give your power away.

764
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:09,811
Hmm?

765
01:11:11,613 --> 01:11:13,214
You mean to love?

766
01:11:13,347 --> 01:11:16,050
Love makes you weak.

767
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:18,052
You really believe that?

768
01:11:20,555 --> 01:11:22,857
You have never loved?

769
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:27,327
I will be miganon one day.

770
01:11:29,197 --> 01:11:31,498
You cannot have both.

771
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:33,367
Will that be enough?

772
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,538
This is the life we have chosen.

773
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:39,207
We each survive in our own way.

774
01:11:39,339 --> 01:11:41,676
You will find yours.

775
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:57,424
My mother was a slave.

776
01:11:57,559 --> 01:12:00,195
That is all I ever knew
of African people.

777
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:04,065
I never dreamed that we were...

778
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:08,069
kings and warriors.

779
01:12:10,337 --> 01:12:13,107
But now...

780
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:15,543
I see the majesty.

781
01:12:16,644 --> 01:12:18,546
I see the beauty.

782
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:21,683
I think you are a good man.

783
01:12:21,816 --> 01:12:25,220
You must not ally yourself
with slavers.

784
01:12:25,352 --> 01:12:26,988
We grew up together.

785
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:30,390
But does he see our beauty
as you do?

786
01:12:40,335 --> 01:12:42,402
Nawi, the Oyo are coming.

787
01:12:42,537 --> 01:12:43,638
We are ready.

788
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:46,174
No, not just the Oyo.

789
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:48,343
Other tribes, too.

790
01:12:48,475 --> 01:12:51,346
I heard the general plotting.

791
01:12:51,478 --> 01:12:53,948
We must tell the miganon.

792
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:55,250
I must get back.

793
01:12:55,382 --> 01:12:56,885
Nawi, wait.

794
01:12:57,018 --> 01:13:00,121
Tomorrow, we are going to leave.

795
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,637
This is Ogou.

796
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:17,639
He is courage and strength.

797
01:13:17,772 --> 01:13:20,808
Perhaps he will bring you
back to us.

798
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:26,614
I have nothing to give to you.

799
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:49,537
I will take you back.

800
01:14:07,588 --> 01:14:09,590
Miganon.

801
01:14:12,492 --> 01:14:14,062
I have heard something.

802
01:14:14,195 --> 01:14:16,397
One of the men that came
to the palace,

803
01:14:16,531 --> 01:14:17,932
Malik, he says the Oyo general

804
01:14:18,066 --> 01:14:20,401
is growing his army
with other tribes.

805
01:14:20,535 --> 01:14:22,370
They will march on Dahomey.

806
01:14:22,502 --> 01:14:25,606
The Oyo have given them courage.

807
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:32,479
Where were you speaking
with this man, Malik?

808
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:34,182
He spoke to me
through the palm line.

809
01:14:34,315 --> 01:14:36,651
On the night you swear loyalty
to your sisters,

810
01:14:36,784 --> 01:14:39,486
you speak in secret
with a slaver?

811
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,487
He's not a slaver.

812
01:14:40,621 --> 01:14:42,457
His mother was Dahomey.

813
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:45,360
You defend him?

814
01:14:45,526 --> 01:14:48,096
Is that knife a gift?

815
01:14:49,664 --> 01:14:52,000
Where have you been?

816
01:14:52,133 --> 01:14:54,936
- I have been nowhere.
- Come here.

817
01:14:57,138 --> 01:14:58,539
Here.

818
01:15:11,686 --> 01:15:14,022
You are an Agojie.

819
01:15:14,856 --> 01:15:16,891
You cannot be with a man.

820
01:15:17,025 --> 01:15:20,628
Do you think you are so special
that I will not put you out?

821
01:15:20,762 --> 01:15:21,829
Because I will.

822
01:15:21,963 --> 01:15:23,564
I do not think I am special.

823
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:25,299
Do not bow your head.

824
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:27,568
Do not.

825
01:15:28,503 --> 01:15:30,071
I know your arrogance.

826
01:15:30,204 --> 01:15:32,206
You continue to do
as you please.

827
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:33,408
You disregard the rules.

828
01:15:33,541 --> 01:15:35,676
What do you want from me?

829
01:15:36,611 --> 01:15:38,346
I proved myself today.

830
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:39,480
I am the best.

831
01:15:39,614 --> 01:15:42,450
It is not enough to be the best.

832
01:15:42,583 --> 01:15:45,586
Your arrogance and your
stupidity will get you caught.

833
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,588
I am not you.

834
01:15:47,722 --> 01:15:49,457
Izogie told me
that you were captured.

835
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:50,992
That will never be me!

836
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:53,961
I was raped many times
each night.

837
01:15:57,031 --> 01:16:01,302
When they would come,
I wished only to die.

838
01:16:03,404 --> 01:16:05,406
They took it all away.

839
01:16:05,541 --> 01:16:08,176
Everything I knew.

840
01:16:08,309 --> 01:16:12,313
And when I finally escaped,
I was with child.

841
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:15,750
A child of those men.

842
01:16:15,883 --> 01:16:18,786
I would have to leave
my sisters forever,

843
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,255
so I had to hide.

844
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:24,225
I bathed alone.

845
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:26,327
And my belly grew.

846
01:16:41,242 --> 01:16:42,777
It was a girl.

847
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:46,447
I told Amenza, "Take it away."

848
01:16:46,582 --> 01:16:51,385
But the blood, it kept coming,
and Amenza ran away

849
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,789
to find medicine,
and she left me with her.

850
01:16:57,559 --> 01:16:59,827
So I did something.

851
01:17:28,356 --> 01:17:29,591
I made a cut

852
01:17:29,724 --> 01:17:31,993
on the back of the left arm,

853
01:17:32,126 --> 01:17:35,496
and I pressed a tooth into it.

854
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:37,765
A shark's tooth.

855
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:46,807
It isn't me.

856
01:19:57,173 --> 01:20:00,275
They are a day's
journey from our plateau.

857
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:03,211
They will set up camp there.

858
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:06,082
They expect us
to defend ourselves

859
01:20:06,214 --> 01:20:08,017
from behind our walls.

860
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,584
We are greatly outnumbered.

861
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:13,822
Their size makes them
arrogant and slow,

862
01:20:13,956 --> 01:20:15,724
like their guns.

863
01:20:30,572 --> 01:20:34,342
But you don't need a gun
to use gunpowder.

864
01:20:35,443 --> 01:20:39,081
You just need a spark.

865
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:44,586
Sometimes a termite
can take down an elephant.

866
01:20:45,553 --> 01:20:49,125
We will bring the war to them.

867
01:20:53,963 --> 01:20:55,131
Agojie!

868
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:49,517
For 90 years,

869
01:21:49,651 --> 01:21:53,189
Dahomey has lived
under the thumb of the Oyo!

870
01:21:54,589 --> 01:21:56,125
When it rains,

871
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:59,962
our ancestors weep
for the pain we have felt

872
01:22:00,095 --> 01:22:05,034
in the dark hulls of ships
bound for distant shores!

873
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:09,838
When the wind blows,

874
01:22:09,972 --> 01:22:13,341
our ancestors push us
to march into battle

875
01:22:13,474 --> 01:22:15,510
against those who enslave us!

876
01:22:15,643 --> 01:22:18,113
When it thunders,

877
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:23,384
our ancestors demand
we rip the shackles of doubt

878
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:25,687
from our minds
and fight with courage!

879
01:22:27,388 --> 01:22:31,426
We fight not just for today
but for the future!

880
01:22:32,328 --> 01:22:36,664
We are the spear of victory!

881
01:22:36,798 --> 01:22:39,467
We are the blade of freedom!

882
01:22:40,368 --> 01:22:43,404
We are Dahomey!

883
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:44,405
Agojie!

884
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:46,008
- Wu Suu!
- Agojie!

885
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:47,209
Wu Suu!

886
01:22:47,343 --> 01:22:48,944
- Agojie!
- Wu Suu!

887
01:22:49,078 --> 01:22:50,145
Agojie!

888
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:51,813
- Wu Suu!
- Agojie!

889
01:22:51,947 --> 01:22:53,015
Wu Suu!

890
01:24:06,922 --> 01:24:09,991
We are under attack! Attack!

891
01:24:18,634 --> 01:24:20,536
Grab your weapons!

892
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,638
We are Oyo!

893
01:24:23,773 --> 01:24:24,873
Oyo!

894
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:14,870
Where is Oba?

895
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:19,008
Where is Oba?!

896
01:28:32,855 --> 01:28:34,890
Fall back!

897
01:28:35,024 --> 01:28:37,158
Fall back! Oyo, fall back!

898
01:29:10,626 --> 01:29:12,328
Grab the Agojie.

899
01:29:12,461 --> 01:29:15,131
Oyo, move!

900
01:29:15,263 --> 01:29:17,099
Oba wants the Agojie.

901
01:29:17,232 --> 01:29:19,502
Move, move, move!

902
01:29:34,249 --> 01:29:35,584
They are retreating!

903
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:38,387
Move, move, move!

904
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:06,549
You fought well,
my young sister.

905
01:30:10,386 --> 01:30:12,788
Now you must rest.

906
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:21,897
Ghezo! Wu Suu!

907
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:27,169
She is not here.

908
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:29,839
No one has seen her.

909
01:31:13,449 --> 01:31:14,984
Fumbe.

910
01:31:16,152 --> 01:31:17,219
I failed.

911
01:31:17,353 --> 01:31:18,353
No.

912
01:31:18,454 --> 01:31:20,523
You stayed alive.

913
01:31:23,726 --> 01:31:25,861
You are not tied to anyone.

914
01:31:25,995 --> 01:31:27,196
Mm-mm.

915
01:31:27,329 --> 01:31:28,831
Go over.

916
01:31:30,499 --> 01:31:33,002
Do you want to live?

917
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:37,940
Now.

918
01:31:58,694 --> 01:32:01,230
We need to buy passage.

919
01:32:01,363 --> 01:32:02,431
We are not going home?

920
01:32:02,565 --> 01:32:04,099
We have lost.

921
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:07,369
At home, we are dead men.

922
01:32:09,405 --> 01:32:11,273
Put this one on display.

923
01:32:11,407 --> 01:32:14,810
The bids will be higher
for soldiers.

924
01:32:18,681 --> 01:32:20,483
Move.

925
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:22,152
I said move.

926
01:32:44,707 --> 01:32:46,544
Move back!

927
01:32:46,676 --> 01:32:49,879
Make space for one more.

928
01:33:04,994 --> 01:33:08,031
Izogie.

929
01:33:09,799 --> 01:33:12,202
Come. Sit.

930
01:33:12,335 --> 01:33:14,170
Sit.

931
01:33:26,716 --> 01:33:27,917
Eat.

932
01:33:28,051 --> 01:33:31,020
We will need our strength
to escape.

933
01:33:34,757 --> 01:33:36,527
My arm is broken.

934
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:39,262
I know what I must do.

935
01:33:40,797 --> 01:33:43,032
What the miganon said.

936
01:33:45,034 --> 01:33:47,737
We will slit our throats.

937
01:33:49,305 --> 01:33:51,307
We will not.

938
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:54,512
"Fear not.

939
01:33:54,644 --> 01:33:57,113
"Face it head-on.

940
01:33:59,182 --> 01:34:02,719
Relentlessly, we will fight."

941
01:34:04,622 --> 01:34:05,755
Hey.

942
01:34:05,889 --> 01:34:08,592
You are Izogie.

943
01:34:08,725 --> 01:34:10,660
You said it.

944
01:34:10,793 --> 01:34:13,830
"Relentlessly, we will fight."

945
01:34:14,797 --> 01:34:16,166
Come on!

946
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,922
Push it back together.

947
01:35:04,914 --> 01:35:07,951
You are strong for a little fly.

948
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,430
Now what?

949
01:35:48,391 --> 01:35:50,594
They were
taking us to the barracoons.

950
01:35:50,728 --> 01:35:52,795
How many others?

951
01:35:52,929 --> 01:35:54,565
Uh, three, I think.

952
01:35:54,698 --> 01:35:56,933
- Izogie?
- Uh...

953
01:35:57,066 --> 01:35:58,801
I did not see her.

954
01:36:00,203 --> 01:36:02,606
Nawi said to throw myself
off the wagon.

955
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:04,907
Nawi?

956
01:36:09,912 --> 01:36:12,048
Miganon, Ajahi.

957
01:36:12,181 --> 01:36:14,350
The king requests you.

958
01:36:14,484 --> 01:36:18,187
I have brought you here
because I have chosen kpojito.

959
01:36:18,321 --> 01:36:21,257
Kpojito is beloved
of the people.

960
01:36:21,391 --> 01:36:25,261
She must be deserving of their
admiration and their trust.

961
01:36:25,395 --> 01:36:29,767
We must share the same vision
for our future.

962
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:31,067
A bold future.

963
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:35,805
For that reason,
I have chosen Nanisca.

964
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:41,377
She is a common soldier.

965
01:36:41,512 --> 01:36:43,122
- Will you sit down.
- Ruined by the enemy.

966
01:36:43,146 --> 01:36:45,815
- Sit down and be quiet!
- Shante.

967
01:36:48,418 --> 01:36:52,889
Kelu, Efe, go and talk to her.
Go, go, go.

968
01:36:54,123 --> 01:36:56,192
We will celebrate.

969
01:36:56,326 --> 01:36:58,194
We will bring the city
to the palace,

970
01:36:58,328 --> 01:36:59,896
and we will have a big feast.

971
01:37:00,029 --> 01:37:01,931
Go and prepare.

972
01:37:08,004 --> 01:37:10,039
Well done.

973
01:37:23,019 --> 01:37:25,988
My king, it is a great honor.

974
01:37:26,122 --> 01:37:28,257
But perhaps it is too soon,

975
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:30,126
when we have lost
so many soldiers

976
01:37:30,259 --> 01:37:31,861
and the people are grieving.

977
01:37:31,994 --> 01:37:33,863
Grieving?

978
01:37:33,996 --> 01:37:34,864
No one is grieving.

979
01:37:34,997 --> 01:37:36,132
We have won.

980
01:37:36,265 --> 01:37:37,900
We have thrown off the yoke.

981
01:37:38,034 --> 01:37:39,902
My king, I wish to seek
our lost Agojie.

982
01:37:40,036 --> 01:37:41,137
Some were taken captive.

983
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:42,615
They will be sold,
used by the men.

984
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,542
Nanisca, the moment
you seek is here.

985
01:37:45,676 --> 01:37:47,578
The few have been sacrificed
for the many.

986
01:37:47,711 --> 01:37:50,581
- Now we must move forward.
- I can go alone. Let me try.

987
01:37:50,714 --> 01:37:53,584
- The Oyo...
- You disobey me, Nanisca.

988
01:37:53,717 --> 01:37:57,353
Are you confusing
my admiration for weakness?

989
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,323
I am your king.

990
01:38:00,456 --> 01:38:04,894
Let me tell you, you will not
seek out those captives.

991
01:38:05,027 --> 01:38:06,996
You must stay by my side

992
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:09,899
and take the honor I bestow you.

993
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:13,236
Do not force my anger.

994
01:38:28,317 --> 01:38:30,119
In the morning, they will come.

995
01:38:30,253 --> 01:38:32,155
- Back up! Move it! Move it!
- Get back! Back!

996
01:38:32,288 --> 01:38:34,390
- Move back!
- Back! Move it!

997
01:38:34,525 --> 01:38:35,525
Move!

998
01:38:35,559 --> 01:38:38,161
Stay back!

999
01:38:46,703 --> 01:38:48,204
Move!

1000
01:38:48,337 --> 01:38:51,608
They will take the Agojie first.

1001
01:39:13,229 --> 01:39:17,233
On your feet.

1002
01:39:24,307 --> 01:39:27,276
We must have patience.

1003
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:35,084
When we are brought
to the block,

1004
01:39:35,218 --> 01:39:37,688
we will be unshackled.

1005
01:39:37,821 --> 01:39:40,156
We will have our legs.

1006
01:39:50,132 --> 01:39:53,570
We must not let them see
my arm is broken.

1007
01:40:10,286 --> 01:40:14,023
When we are sold,
that will be the moment.

1008
01:40:14,156 --> 01:40:15,993
You will make a distraction.

1009
01:40:16,125 --> 01:40:17,895
I give you 90 for this one.

1010
01:40:18,027 --> 01:40:19,563
120.

1011
01:40:21,163 --> 01:40:23,499
Oba, you said you would
be good to me here.

1012
01:40:23,634 --> 01:40:25,802
Mm-mm. It will go
to the highest bidder.

1013
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:29,006
We will
each disarm a guard and run.

1014
01:40:29,138 --> 01:40:32,108
Do not stop
until you reach the water.

1015
01:40:32,241 --> 01:40:34,343
150 reais.

1016
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,251
Nawi!

1017
01:41:34,972 --> 01:41:36,305
No.

1018
01:41:39,241 --> 01:41:41,845
No.

1019
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:45,849
No.

1020
01:41:52,221 --> 01:41:53,824
Izogie.

1021
01:41:53,957 --> 01:41:58,028
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1022
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,796
Get up.

1023
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:00,998
No!

1024
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:04,367
Izogie, get up.

1025
01:42:10,306 --> 01:42:13,142
No, no, no, no.

1026
01:42:13,275 --> 01:42:14,845
I'm sorry.

1027
01:42:14,978 --> 01:42:16,278
N-Nawi.

1028
01:42:18,447 --> 01:42:20,483
You move like a sloth.

1029
01:42:20,617 --> 01:42:23,020
I'm sorry.

1030
01:42:23,152 --> 01:42:24,286
I'm sorry.

1031
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,155
I'm sorry. Let's-let's go.

1032
01:42:26,288 --> 01:42:28,357
Let's go.

1033
01:42:32,228 --> 01:42:34,097
Izogie?

1034
01:42:34,263 --> 01:42:36,533
Izogie. Izogie.

1035
01:42:40,302 --> 01:42:42,204
You get away from her!

1036
01:42:42,338 --> 01:42:45,108
Get away!

1037
01:43:02,224 --> 01:43:06,195
If you want this one, 100 reais.

1038
01:43:25,849 --> 01:43:27,416
- What are you doing?
- Move aside.

1039
01:43:27,551 --> 01:43:29,753
You know what the king
will do to you if you defy him.

1040
01:43:29,886 --> 01:43:31,387
You want to be expelled
or worse?

1041
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:33,289
- No, no, no, no. Nanisca.
- Amenza. Amenza.

1042
01:43:33,422 --> 01:43:36,059
- I cannot stand by.
- I know what it is.

1043
01:43:36,193 --> 01:43:38,628
In the dream.

1044
01:43:38,762 --> 01:43:41,932
The beast I am so frightened of.

1045
01:43:47,403 --> 01:43:49,706
It is me.

1046
01:43:53,577 --> 01:43:56,479
It is that girl who was silenced

1047
01:43:56,613 --> 01:44:00,517
in those shackles by those men.

1048
01:44:03,319 --> 01:44:05,488
I've hidden her away.

1049
01:44:05,622 --> 01:44:08,558
I have denied her pain.

1050
01:44:12,361 --> 01:44:15,832
But I'm going to hear her now.

1051
01:44:16,933 --> 01:44:18,168
Hmm?

1052
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,737
I have to try to save her.

1053
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:22,005
No.

1054
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:25,474
Please.

1055
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,929
It is not safe for us.
I brought you clothes.

1056
01:45:53,063 --> 01:45:55,532
I will sneak you out
at nightfall.

1057
01:45:55,665 --> 01:45:57,334
Do you own me now?

1058
01:45:57,466 --> 01:45:58,935
- Of course not.
- Get out!

1059
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:00,989
- I am trying to protect you.
- By locking me in?

1060
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:03,273
Do you know what
they would do to you?

1061
01:46:03,405 --> 01:46:05,609
A white man was killed.

1062
01:46:09,512 --> 01:46:12,515
You have the key now.

1063
01:46:12,649 --> 01:46:15,785
You can choose
when the lock is turned.

1064
01:47:19,082 --> 01:47:23,520
My mother guided me here
to find myself.

1065
01:47:24,453 --> 01:47:25,922
And I found you.

1066
01:47:26,056 --> 01:47:30,527
I have booked passage on
a cargo ship bound for England.

1067
01:47:31,728 --> 01:47:33,196
I want to keep you safe.

1068
01:47:38,568 --> 01:47:42,906
My heart has many scars.

1069
01:47:59,289 --> 01:48:02,491
Husband, please accept
my deepest apologies

1070
01:48:02,625 --> 01:48:05,628
- for questioning your will.
- Mm.

1071
01:48:05,762 --> 01:48:07,464
What do you want?

1072
01:48:07,630 --> 01:48:08,630
Move, my friend.

1073
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:10,633
The wives are whispering.

1074
01:48:10,767 --> 01:48:12,669
I told Tanonu
what they say, and...

1075
01:48:12,802 --> 01:48:14,204
Have I not told you
not to discuss

1076
01:48:14,337 --> 01:48:16,373
my business with the wives?
Have I not told you?

1077
01:48:16,505 --> 01:48:18,608
My king, please forgive me.

1078
01:48:18,742 --> 01:48:20,210
Nanisca's gone to Ouidah

1079
01:48:20,343 --> 01:48:22,612
with the migan
and a number of her soldiers.

1080
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:24,581
- Eh?
- We must postpone the feast.

1081
01:48:24,714 --> 01:48:26,316
No, no. The-the people gossip.

1082
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:30,086
You cannot postpone it now,
not without looking weak.

1083
01:49:10,593 --> 01:49:13,730
Where are the others?

1084
01:49:13,863 --> 01:49:17,200
Izogie was killed, Miganon.

1085
01:49:17,333 --> 01:49:19,669
Nawi is gone.

1086
01:49:36,686 --> 01:49:38,556
There will be no prisoners.

1087
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:42,258
Burn their whole trade
to the ground.

1088
01:50:08,985 --> 01:50:12,255
Sound the alarm!

1089
01:50:31,908 --> 01:50:33,810
Nawi. Nawi.

1090
01:50:33,943 --> 01:50:35,945
I need to come in.

1091
01:50:37,814 --> 01:50:38,882
We must go.

1092
01:50:39,015 --> 01:50:40,884
My sisters have come.

1093
01:50:41,017 --> 01:50:42,620
I have to help them.

1094
01:50:42,752 --> 01:50:44,654
Then I will help you.

1095
01:50:44,787 --> 01:50:47,790
No. Malik.

1096
01:50:48,691 --> 01:50:50,960
You must go.

1097
01:50:55,965 --> 01:50:58,301
Your clothes are bloody.

1098
01:51:01,539 --> 01:51:03,773
You can wear these.

1099
01:51:10,847 --> 01:51:13,449
I will take care of him.

1100
01:51:14,652 --> 01:51:16,920
I will be on the beach.

1101
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:55,925
I want Oba.

1102
01:52:12,576 --> 01:52:15,778
Hurry up, this way,
this way! Come on!

1103
01:52:15,912 --> 01:52:17,780
Move, damn it!

1104
01:52:25,522 --> 01:52:27,524
No! No! No!

1105
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:29,492
Malik!

1106
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,866
Malik! Malik, in!

1107
01:52:50,113 --> 01:52:52,215
Malik, no! No! No!

1108
01:52:52,348 --> 01:52:53,950
Loose me! Loose me!

1109
01:52:54,083 --> 01:52:56,754
<i>Não! Não! Não!</i>

1110
01:52:56,886 --> 01:52:59,556
Malik! Malik, <i>não!</i>

1111
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:02,425
<i>Não!</i>

1112
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,336
Hyah!

1113
01:55:19,863 --> 01:55:22,498
You do not remember me.

1114
01:55:25,903 --> 01:55:29,138
Now you will never forget.

1115
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:10,246
No, no, no, no!

1116
01:57:07,671 --> 01:57:08,939
Agojie!

1117
01:57:09,071 --> 01:57:10,139
Wu Suu!

1118
01:57:10,273 --> 01:57:12,809
- Agojie!
- Wu Suu!

1119
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:14,210
Agojie!

1120
01:57:14,343 --> 01:57:15,846
Wu Suu!

1121
01:57:15,979 --> 01:57:17,848
- Agojie!
- Wu Suu!

1122
01:57:17,981 --> 01:57:19,583
Agojie!

1123
01:57:19,716 --> 01:57:20,784
Wu Suu!

1124
01:57:20,918 --> 01:57:22,586
Agojie!

1125
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,153
Wu Suu!

1126
01:57:26,188 --> 01:57:27,056
Come. We cannot stay here.

1127
01:57:27,189 --> 01:57:28,725
Get in the boat!

1128
01:58:14,972 --> 01:58:16,974
Shante, well done.

1129
01:58:17,107 --> 01:58:18,877
You deserve it.

1130
01:58:35,527 --> 01:58:37,729
Nanisca! Nanisca!

1131
01:58:37,862 --> 01:58:41,098
Nanisca! Nanisca! Nanisca!

1132
01:58:41,231 --> 01:58:44,134
Nanisca! Nanisca!

1133
01:58:44,268 --> 01:58:48,005
Nanisca! Nanisca! Nanisca!

1134
01:58:48,138 --> 01:58:50,875
Nanisca! Nanisca!

1135
01:58:51,008 --> 01:58:54,612
Nanisca! Nanisca! Nanisca!

1136
01:58:54,746 --> 01:58:56,980
Nanisca! Nanisca!

1137
01:58:57,114 --> 01:58:59,717
Nanisca! Nanisca!

1138
01:59:20,405 --> 01:59:25,142
You disobey your king, Nanisca.

1139
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:29,414
I will resign my command.

1140
01:59:40,290 --> 01:59:42,192
People of Dahomey...

1141
01:59:44,294 --> 01:59:46,531
we have ended the reign
of the Oyo Empire.

1142
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:55,940
Look upon the faces
of the warriors.

1143
01:59:56,073 --> 01:59:58,175
Look at them.

1144
01:59:59,142 --> 02:00:01,412
Many never thought it possible.

1145
02:00:02,112 --> 02:00:04,047
But we believed.

1146
02:00:05,182 --> 02:00:07,418
That is what makes
a great leader.

1147
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:10,388
Seeing what others do not.

1148
02:00:10,522 --> 02:00:14,325
The Europeans
and the Americans have seen

1149
02:00:14,459 --> 02:00:18,028
if you want to hold
a people in chains,

1150
02:00:18,161 --> 02:00:19,564
one must first convince them

1151
02:00:19,697 --> 02:00:23,166
that they are meant to be bound.

1152
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:26,905
We joined them in becoming
our own oppressor.

1153
02:00:27,037 --> 02:00:29,239
But no more.

1154
02:00:30,742 --> 02:00:32,644
No more.

1155
02:00:34,111 --> 02:00:36,548
We are a warrior people!

1156
02:00:36,681 --> 02:00:40,250
And there is power
in our mind...

1157
02:00:40,385 --> 02:00:44,656
in our unity, in our culture.

1158
02:00:44,789 --> 02:00:48,426
If we understand that power,
we will be limitless.

1159
02:00:49,928 --> 02:00:51,996
My people,

1160
02:00:52,129 --> 02:00:54,699
this is a vision I will lead.

1161
02:00:55,633 --> 02:00:58,570
It is a vision that is shared.

1162
02:01:03,308 --> 02:01:06,344
Heroes of Dahomey,

1163
02:01:06,477 --> 02:01:10,180
behold the bravest of the brave,

1164
02:01:10,315 --> 02:01:12,215
appointed by King Ghezo,

1165
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:16,086
elevated to the sacred title
of kpojito,

1166
02:01:16,219 --> 02:01:18,990
Nanisca, the woman king.

1167
02:02:13,311 --> 02:02:16,481
An offering for Izogie.

1168
02:02:16,614 --> 02:02:19,851
She does not want that water.

1169
02:02:20,952 --> 02:02:22,754
She wants this.

1170
02:02:38,770 --> 02:02:41,639
In my blood is the blood
of a killer.

1171
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:49,514
A man who gave you so much pain.

1172
02:02:54,318 --> 02:02:56,587
I am sorry.

1173
02:03:05,897 --> 02:03:07,932
You are Agojie.

1174
02:03:19,444 --> 02:03:22,212
I am sorry.

1175
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,550
I left you.

1176
02:03:29,353 --> 02:03:31,956
I was not brave enough.

1177
02:03:34,926 --> 02:03:39,630
But you survived because
you are meant to be here.

1178
02:03:47,605 --> 02:03:51,274
It is not your fault
what happened to me.

1179
02:03:54,312 --> 02:03:56,514
You...

1180
02:03:56,647 --> 02:03:59,917
are not the thing that hurt me.

1181
02:04:04,355 --> 02:04:06,691
You are Nawi.

1182
02:04:10,394 --> 02:04:12,797
You are my daughter.

1183
02:04:14,966 --> 02:04:16,701
I am sorry.

1184
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,960
Mother, will you dance?

1185
02:09:27,845 --> 02:09:29,880
Sisters in blood.

1186
02:09:30,014 --> 02:09:35,686
You fall and now you rise.

1187
02:09:37,755 --> 02:09:39,290
Dance with us.

1188
02:09:39,424 --> 02:09:42,561
Be with us.

1189
02:09:42,693 --> 02:09:44,895
You live for me...

1190
02:09:45,763 --> 02:09:47,865
and I for you.

1191
