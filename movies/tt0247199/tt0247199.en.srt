<i>And it came to pass
after these things</i>

3
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:04,851
<i>that God tested Abraham,</i>

4
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:07,286
<i>and said to him, "Abraham."</i>

5
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:09,379
<i>And Abraham said, "Here I am."</i>

6
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,478
<i>And God said, "Now take your son--</i>

7
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:15,817
<i>your only son whom you love, Isaac,</i>

8
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:17,945
<i>and go unto the land of Moriah</i>

9
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:20,386
<i>and offer him there as a sacrifice</i>

10
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,921
<i>on a mountain that I will show you."</i>

11
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,750
<i>So...</i>

12
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:27,982
<i>everyone, what's really going on here?</i>

13
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,045
<i>It was a test of Abraham's faith,</i>

14
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>of his devotion to God.</i>

15
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,785
<i>Danny, as usual,
you have something to add?</i>

16
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:36,946
<i>It's not about Abraham's faith.</i>

17
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:39,352
<i>It's about God's power.</i>

18
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:41,718
<i>God says,
"You know how powerful I am?"</i>

19
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:43,879
<i>I can make you do anything I want,</i>

20
00:01:43,955 --> 00:01:45,387
<i>no matter how stupid--</i>

21
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,512
<i>even kill your own son,</i>

22
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:49,815
<i>because I'm everything
and you're nothing."</i>

23
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,377
- Hey, Yeshiva-bukah.
- What?

24
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:07,546
Get up!

25
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:09,952
Get the fuck up!

26
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:13,681
What the fuck do you think this is?!

27
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:20,920
Do you think this is a fucking test?!

28
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:24,080
You think God's going to provide
a fucking ram

29
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:26,553
instead of you? No!

30
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,719
Do me a favor...

31
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:32,720
why don't you fucking hit me, okay?

32
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,120
Hit me.

33
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:39,182
Hit me!

34
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,881
Hit me, hit me, hit me.
Fucking hit me.

35
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:43,716
Hit me, please!

36
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,879
You fucking kike!

37
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:28,547
<i>It will no longer be possible
to say that the country</i>

38
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,144
<i>has a unified set of core beliefs.</i>

39
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:32,278
<i>At that point we will cease
to be a nation</i>

40
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:34,947
<i>in the traditional sense,
and will become instead</i>

41
00:06:35,022 --> 00:06:37,180
<i>a confederation of specific interest groups</i>

42
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:39,221
<i>like medieval principalities.</i>

43
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,810
<i>And at the same time,
we will flow into the anonymous</i>

44
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:45,217
<i>undistinguished sea
of the global market.</i>

45
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,219
<i>The economic advantages
of this arrangement are obvious...</i>

46
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:52,253
<i>Where I grew up in South Boston,</i>

47
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:54,083
when a kid would walk down the street,

48
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:56,144
everybody knew his name.

49
00:06:56,221 --> 00:06:58,551
He runs out in front of a car,
some old mick'll say,

50
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:01,611
"Jimmy Dunn, you get back
on that sidewalk and you stay there."

51
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,518
Then he graduates high school,

52
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,747
he goes and sees his uncle
down at the gasworks

53
00:07:05,822 --> 00:07:07,651
or a priest's brother at the shipyards.

54
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,153
He gets his apprentice papers.

55
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,119
Eight years later
he's making $16.50 an hour,

56
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:14,187
he's got four kids,
he's playing ball and going--

57
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,051
Hey everybody.

58
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:29,152
Today, that kid walks down the street,

59
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,710
it's filled with trash,

60
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,414
half the faces are black,

61
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:36,011
shipyard's closed.

62
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,246
Only jobs left at the gasworks
are set-asides,

63
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:40,184
and by the time he drops out
of high school,

64
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:43,050
he'd rather get a job
at the Burger King.

65
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,747
So he drinks, does crack, whatever.

66
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,447
When he hangs himself
on his front porch at 23,

67
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:51,955
the only people that'll mourn him
are a few of his buddies...

68
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:53,885
and his mom.

69
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:57,349
The soul of this country

70
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:59,911
is being destroyed.

71
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:02,477
And the only thing the present government
can offer us

72
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:06,510
is free trade, mutual funds, and IPOs.

73
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:10,418
The average man is crushed
less by accumulated wealth

74
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:13,421
then by lack of leadership,
lack of community,

75
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,785
culture...

76
00:08:15,855 --> 00:08:18,719
and the sense of emptiness
he cannot fill on his own.

77
00:08:20,221 --> 00:08:21,710
That's why I'm a fascist.

78
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:23,744
It's the only form of government

79
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,879
that can address
our fundamental needs.

80
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:27,921
What about race?

81
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,112
This isn't the time for that.

82
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:32,517
I disagree.
I think race is central

83
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:34,417
to everything we're talking about here.

84
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,613
Spiritual life comes from race,
from the blood.

85
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:38,881
Without that,
we're no better than the Jews.

86
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,713
What's wrong with the Jews?

87
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,845
Carla.

88
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:48,649
Look it, the point is the modern world
is a Jewish disease.

89
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:50,449
- All right?
- What disease?

90
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:52,283
Abstraction.

91
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:55,048
They're obsessed with abstraction.

92
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:57,917
So what would you propose, then?

93
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,253
Killing Jews.

94
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:03,446
That would be a catastrophic mistake.

95
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:07,151
People hate Jews.
Do you agree?

96
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,084
They used to.
Today, that's not an issue.

97
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:11,519
No. No, no.
Deep down,

98
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:14,019
beneath all the tolerance
that they learn on television,

99
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,678
nothing's changed.

100
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,414
The very word makes their skin crawl.

101
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:20,784
It's not even heat, it's just--

102
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:23,446
it's like the way you feel
when a rat runs across the floor.

103
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,715
You want to step on it.
You just want to crush it.

104
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:28,481
You don't even know why.
It's a physical reaction,

105
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,952
and everyone feels it.

106
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:32,282
Jew.

107
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:35,082
So which ones would you kill?

108
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,280
Barbara Streisand.
Kissinger.

109
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,980
- Dershowitz.
- Roseanne!

110
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:41,248
We don't want celebrity
obscuring the issue.

111
00:09:41,321 --> 00:09:42,617
Which is what?

112
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:45,119
At first, no one will know
why the victims are being killed.

113
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,881
You wouldn't announce it?

114
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:52,079
I'd say nothing,
and after about one or two,

115
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:55,212
people try to find a reason,
an answer.

116
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:57,651
And when it comes out,
the public will be outraged.

117
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,551
It will look like Germany
all over again.

118
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,621
Isn't that what we want?

119
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,621
Germany all over again?

120
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,143
Only done right this time.

121
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:12,017
And when people find out
that rich, successful,

122
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,781
brilliant Jews are being killed,

123
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:15,821
they'll be glad.

124
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:20,115
And they won't say anything,
not even to themselves.

125
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,619
Once someone says it aloud,

126
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,779
they'll think,
"That's exactly what I was thinking."

127
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,685
And it'll all spread from there.

128
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,220
It always does.

129
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:34,253
They're not gonna say nothing.

130
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,583
He's got a point.

131
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:40,053
You're not in school.
What do you do?

132
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:42,679
I drive a forklift...

133
00:10:42,755 --> 00:10:45,721
over at the Big Boy warehouse in Queens.

134
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:48,219
Young man...

135
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,880
Lina Moebius.

136
00:10:49,954 --> 00:10:51,477
And you are?

137
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:52,884
Daniel Balint.

138
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,852
Balint?

139
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,751
It's German.

140
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,014
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint,

141
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:01,519
or any other law enforcement agency?

142
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:07,420
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

143
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,448
So...

144
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,919
what are you really after, Daniel?

145
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:16,351
Hmm?

146
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,285
Do you want to just kill Jews,

147
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:20,321
or do you have something larger in mind?

148
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,819
Curtis thinks your ideas
would marginalize us.

149
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,046
Curtis, we're already marginal.

150
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:26,848
That's our appeal.

151
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,410
We're saying what no one else
has the guts to say.

152
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,613
Who would you kill first?

153
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:34,286
Ilio Manzetti.

154
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,251
Former ambassador to France,

155
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,719
managing partner
at Damon & Schwarzchild.

156
00:11:39,821 --> 00:11:41,946
It's an investment banking house.

157
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:45,112
- He's Jewish, Manzetti?
- Totally.

158
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,619
His parents immigrated from Bulgaria
when he was 11.

159
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,783
How would you do this?

160
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:54,412
I need some time to assess
his routines and his security,

161
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,078
but ideally?

162
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:58,485
On a New York City street, midday,

163
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:01,715
with a small caliber automatic
without a silencer.

164
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,720
Why no silencer?

165
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:07,219
'Cause you want it to be an event.

166
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,617
Why don't you come
visit us in the country?

167
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:13,778
We have a retreat.
You might find it interesting.

168
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,312
Bring your friends if you like.

169
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:24,219
He reminds me of Karl
when I first met him.

170
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,980
I thought we agreed.

171
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:29,078
Anti-Semitism is exactly
what we're trying to leave behind.

172
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,485
Killing Manzetti.

173
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:32,282
Did you see how they reacted to him?

174
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:35,150
Yes, of course, in this room,
where people aren't embarrassed

175
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,619
to call themselves Nazis.

176
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,449
It's a romantic movement, Curtis,
it always has been.

177
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:40,851
- Lina--
- Look,

178
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:43,080
I don't care about the Jews
one way or another,

179
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:44,644
but it has a power.

180
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,915
A thousand-year Reich
barely lasted a decade.

181
00:12:48,021 --> 00:12:49,715
You really want to go down
that road again?

182
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:51,946
In America of all places?

183
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,351
Order and discipline
aren't exactly the national virtues.

184
00:12:56,455 --> 00:12:58,318
He's very bright.

185
00:12:58,422 --> 00:13:00,320
He speaks well.

186
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,144
So what do we do with him?

187
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:07,846
Bring his friends?
We're not his friends.

188
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,046
Hey Danny, you fuck the girl yet?

189
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:13,019
- He liked her mom.
- Her mom?

190
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:15,283
That was her mother?

191
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:21,919
Fuck you!

192
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,978
You, get the fuck out of the way!

193
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,651
Fucking niggers!

194
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:33,449
Why don't you go back to Rwanda
and give each other AIDS?!

195
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,714
- Let's go, motherfucker.
- Come on, you fat bitch.

196
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,814
What, you like it in here?

197
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:54,853
Shut the fuck up.

198
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,251
You ever read "Mein Kampf"?

199
00:13:57,321 --> 00:14:00,219
Hitler had some of his best ideas in prison.

200
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,777
Daniel Balint.

201
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:05,843
Hey, shut the hell up.

202
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:15,178
I'm not going anywhere without them.

203
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:21,480
Can I use a credit card?

204
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:27,021
Be quiet.
I don't want to wake up my mother.

205
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:45,911
"And the words fell apart in my mouth

206
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:48,214
like moldering mushrooms."

207
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:58,580
A lot of these are in Spanish.

208
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:02,109
Yeah, my grandmother's from Argentina.

209
00:15:02,155 --> 00:15:05,315
My father's family
went over during the war.

210
00:15:05,422 --> 00:15:07,614
Where's your father now?

211
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:10,687
He's in a mental institution.

212
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:13,945
Is he a Nazi?

213
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:19,620
I don't know.
We don't talk about that.

214
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:27,548
I don't think he cares
about all that stuff...

215
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:30,019
- anymore.
- What's he care about?

216
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,848
Killing himself.

217
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:45,910
You think people ever commit suicide
out of happiness?

218
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:49,351
That's stupid. Why would they do it
if they were happy?

219
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,244
You're not like the others, are you?

220
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,048
Like your friends.

221
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,110
Yes, I am.

222
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:04,677
Basically I am.

223
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,715
Hurt me.

224
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,419
Just do it. Hurt me.

225
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:24,216
Ow! Not that hard!

226
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,777
Get up.

227
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:32,649
You have to go.

228
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,619
What?

229
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,643
Curtis...

230
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:42,449
bring the paper.

231
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:13,215
- Hey, man.
- Punk-ass.

232
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:35,010
Where'd you have it last, Dad?
Try to remember.

233
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,053
Who's that?

234
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,946
Stay back, stay back.

235
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,877
<i>"And offer him there as a sacrifice</i>

236
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:03,943
<i>on a mountain that I will show you."</i>

237
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:07,976
<i>Everyone, what's really going on here?
Schlomo?</i>

238
00:18:08,055 --> 00:18:11,317
<i>It was a test of Abraham's faith,
of his devotion to God.</i>

239
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:13,251
- Very good.
- Isaac wasn't his only son.

240
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:16,548
- Ishmael was his son, too.
- The only son he loved.

241
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:18,746
Oh, they only kill them
when they love them.

242
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,310
Danny, as usual,
you have something to add?

243
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:25,219
It's not about Abraham's faith.
It's about God's power.

244
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:28,050
God says,
"You know how powerful I am?

245
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:30,383
I can make you do anything I want,

246
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,420
no matter how stupid--

247
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,318
even kill your own son,

248
00:18:34,421 --> 00:18:36,512
because I'm everything
and you're nothing."

249
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:40,213
Okay, Danny,
but if Hashem is everything

250
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:42,014
and we are nothing,

251
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,280
how then are we to judge His actions?

252
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,809
We have free will and intelligence
which God allegedly gave us.

253
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:49,409
Wait, what are you talking about?

254
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,749
God never lets Abraham kill Isaac.

255
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:53,878
He gives him the ram
so he doesn't have to.

256
00:18:53,954 --> 00:18:56,182
Personally, I think that's a lie.

257
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,652
<i>You think? Based on what?</i>

258
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,584
<i>There's Midrash supporting it.</i>

259
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:03,415
<i>My father read a book
by Shalom Spiegel</i>

260
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,419
that said Isaac died and was reborn.

261
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:09,476
- No one follows that Midrash.
- I do. I follow it.

262
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,043
But okay, say God provided the ram.

263
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:14,746
So what?
Once Abraham raised the knife,

264
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,946
it was as if he'd killed him
in his heart.

265
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,919
He could never forget that,
and neither could Isaac.

266
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:23,216
Look at him, he's traumatized.
He's a putz the rest of his life.

267
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:25,310
Danny, watch your language.

268
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,751
I think the whole Jewish people
were permanently scarred...

269
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,482
Danny?

270
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,646
I knocked, but you didn't answer.

271
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,980
What are you doing?

272
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,612
I just came to get some stuff.
I'll be gone in five minutes.

273
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,912
He's going to die. Huh.

274
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,680
He won't take his medicine,

275
00:20:17,754 --> 00:20:20,311
he eats dairy.

276
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:22,649
Probably still smokes
when I'm not around.

277
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,516
I asked him to move in with us.

278
00:20:24,621 --> 00:20:28,644
It was Alex's idea,
but he doesn't want to be any trouble.

279
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:30,119
Yeah, well...

280
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:31,914
then he couldn't be bitter
about living alone.

281
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:34,418
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?

282
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:45,743
Jesus Christ, Danny,
how can you wear that thing?

283
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:47,411
Linda, don't start with me.

284
00:20:47,521 --> 00:20:49,749
Do you know what it means
to your people?

285
00:20:49,821 --> 00:20:51,480
- They're not my people.
- Yeah?

286
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,782
- Tell that to Hitler.
- Oh, he decides?

287
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,342
Hitler's the chief rabbi now?

288
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:59,487
- Why?
- There's 50 reasons.

289
00:20:59,554 --> 00:21:00,815
Even if you knew them all,

290
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:02,682
there'd be another 50 you didn't know.

291
00:21:02,754 --> 00:21:04,617
Do you know them?

292
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,510
I made him some noodles for dinner.

293
00:21:15,621 --> 00:21:18,246
You can heat them up
and eat with him if you want.

294
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,309
I can't. I got to go.

295
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:23,216
You can heat them up
and eat with him.

296
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,147
It's Friday.

297
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,277
Do I give a shit?

298
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,213
The Torah says you can't light
a fire on Shabbos

299
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,377
- 'cause it's work, correct?
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:22:03,454 --> 00:22:05,920
But if alternating current
is running through the wires

301
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:08,045
every second of every day
and I turn on a switch

302
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:09,950
sending it here instead of there,

303
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:12,213
how is that lighting a fire?

304
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,411
- Do chickens give milk?
- Exactly.

305
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:21,619
Who's this?

306
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:24,313
It's Dennis Leary.

307
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,387
Funny?

308
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:28,420
Mmm, not like your Uncle Mitch.

309
00:22:28,454 --> 00:22:30,784
He was funny.

310
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,419
Mmm.

311
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,146
Hello?

312
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,948
- <i>Daniel Balint?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

313
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:40,180

315

00:23:00,654 --> 00:23:03,381
<i>Yeah, it's true.</i>

323
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:05,820
<i>How'd you get this number?</i>

324
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:09,046
Danny.

325
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,019
Hey, Guy Danielsen.

326
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,348
You? You looked different
at that meeting.

327
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:14,512
Well, you know.

328
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,178
So the other night,
you said that you thought

329
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:20,152
the modern world was a Jewish disease.

330
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,709
Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

331
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:25,652
In the movement,
this racialist movement,

332
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:27,448
we believe there is
a hierarchy of races.

333
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:31,248
You know, whites at the top,
blacks at the bottom.

334
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,480
Asians, Arabs, Latins...
somewhere in between.

335
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:37,020
Why are you writing this down
if you're recording it?

336
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,450
It helps me concentrate.

337
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:43,649
Danny, what about the Jews?

338
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,346
Jews, Judaism--

339
00:23:46,421 --> 00:23:48,216
it's like a sickness.

340
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,582
How is Judaism a sickness?

341
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:52,677
Take sexuality.

342
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:54,982
- Sexuality?
- Yeah.

343
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,077
- What do you mean?
- You ever fuck a Jewish girl?

344
00:23:57,154 --> 00:23:58,643
What?

345
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:01,152
Did you ever fuck one?

346
00:24:02,754 --> 00:24:05,083
Well, yeah...

347
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,382
I mean, I've been out with--

348
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:10,181
There you go.
What did you notice?

349
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:13,252
Like what?

350
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,149
Jewish girls love to give head.

351
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,482
Right?

352
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:19,520
Yeah, sure. I don't know.
Is that right?

353
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:22,951
- And Jewish men love to get it.
- Everybody likes to get it.

354
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:26,316
Yes, it's very pleasurable,
but Jews are obsessed with it.

355
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,319
You want to know why?

356
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:30,343
Yes, why?

357
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:33,251
Because a Jew is essentially female.

358
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,345
- Female.
- Yeah.

359
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:40,546
Real men--
white, Christian men--

360
00:24:40,621 --> 00:24:44,212
we fuck a woman,
we make her come with our cocks.

361
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,218
But a Jew doesn't like
to penetrate and thrust.

362
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:50,709
He can't assert himself in that way,
so he resorts to these perversions.

363
00:24:50,754 --> 00:24:53,652
Oral sex is technically a perversion.
You know that, right?

364
00:24:54,721 --> 00:24:56,084
Yeah.

365
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:59,609
That's why after a woman's been
with a Jewish man, she's ruined.

366
00:24:59,654 --> 00:25:02,176
She never wants to be
with a normal partner again.

367
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:03,982
So the Jew's a better lover.

368
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:07,680
He's not better.
That's not what I said.

369
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:09,344
I said he gives pleasure.

370
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:11,284
That's actually a weakness.

371
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:14,149
All right, so... it's not that...

372
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,448
the Jew runs the media
or that he owns all the banks,

373
00:25:17,521 --> 00:25:19,510
it's that they're sexually corrupt.

374
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:21,782
The Jews clearly control
the media and the banks--

375
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,820
investment banks,
not the commercial ones--

376
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,877
but the point is,
they carry out in those realms

377
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:28,852
the exact same principles
that they display in sexuality.

378
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,648
They undermine traditional life

379
00:25:30,721 --> 00:25:33,380
and they deracinate society.

380
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:36,614
Deracinate-- tear out the roots.

381
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:40,050
A real people derives its genius
from the land--

382
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,814
from the sun, from the sea,
from the soil.

383
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,750
This is how they know themselves.

384
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,810
But, like, Jews don't even have soil.

385
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,546
He has Israel.

386
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:51,712
- Those aren't Jews.
- Of course they're Jews.

387
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,015
Notice the Israelis.

388
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,018
It's a fundamentally secular society.

389
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,543
They no longer need Judaism
because they have soil.

390
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:02,052
'Cause the real Jew is a wanderer.

391
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,143
He's a nomad.
He's got no roots and no attachments.

392
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,209
So he universalizes everything.

393
00:26:07,254 --> 00:26:09,516
He can't hammer a nail
or plow a field.

394
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:13,713
All he can do is buy, sell,
invest capital and manipulate markets.

395
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,719
You know, it's like all mental.

396
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:18,811
He takes the life of a people
that's rooted in soil,

397
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,079
and then he turns it
into this cosmopolitan culture

398
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:24,279
based on books and numbers and ideas.

399
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,320
You know, this is his strength.

400
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:28,320
Take the greatest Jewish minds ever--

401
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:31,184
Marx, Freud, Einstein--
what have they given us?

402
00:26:31,254 --> 00:26:34,311
Communism, infantile sexuality,

403
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:36,216
and the atom bomb.

404
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,150
In the mere three centuries
it's taken these people

405
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,880
to emerge from the ghettos of Europe,

406
00:26:40,953 --> 00:26:43,351
they've ripped us out
of a world of order and reason.

407
00:26:43,421 --> 00:26:45,909
They've thrown us into a chaos
of class warfare,

408
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,816
irrational urges, relativity,

409
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,376
into a world where the existence
of matter and meaning is in question.

410
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:57,147
Why? 'Cause it's the deepest impulse
of a Jewish soul

411
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,482
to pull at the fabric of life
till there's nothing left but a thread.

412
00:27:00,554 --> 00:27:02,850
They want nothing but nothingness.

413
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,716
Nothingness without end.

414
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:06,514
Wow.

415
00:27:06,621 --> 00:27:08,382
Danny, this is great.

416
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,181
You're incredibly articulate.

417
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,614
But one thing--

418
00:27:17,421 --> 00:27:19,410
how can you believe all of this

419
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:22,817
when you're a Jew yourself?

420
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,484
Excuse me?

421
00:27:29,354 --> 00:27:32,445
Do you know a rabbi Stanley Nadelman?

422
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:37,317
He was at the congregation Oheb Zedeck.

423
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:40,114
Who?
How would I know him?

424
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,277
He said you were bar mitzvahed there

425
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:44,582
in March of 1988.

426
00:27:44,654 --> 00:27:46,677
He said--
and you believe that?

427
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:48,379
And you call yourself a real reporter?

428
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:50,443
Okay, so you're saying
that's not true.

429
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:53,783
Do I look Jewish to you?

430
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:55,513
Look at this.

431
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:58,178
Were you ever bar mitzvahed
anywhere else?

432
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:00,516
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with here?

433
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:01,518
No.

434
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:03,519
Who am I fucking with here?

435
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:06,018
- Not a--
- Not a what?

436
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:07,849
Fuck you.

437
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,409
Why would Nadelman lie to me?

438
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:11,942
To discredit me.

439
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,509
- Yeah, right.
- I know who they are.

440
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:17,520
I already explained this to you, Guy.

441
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:21,111
These people will say and do anything.
It's all narrative.

442
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,652
Are you going to put what he said
in your paper?

443
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:26,880
- Give me a reason not to.
- 'Cause it's slander.

444
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,749
'Cause it's reckless disregard.

445
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,184
'Cause I'm gonna sue
your fucking Jew paper, that's why.

446
00:28:31,254 --> 00:28:33,879
So you're denying
that what he said is true?

447
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:35,442
Yes or no?

448
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:41,919
All right, you know, take it easy.

449
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:49,042
Hey...

450
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,450
look at me, Guy.

451
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,009
You can't even look at me now, right?

452
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:01,683
Danny, please don't.

453
00:29:01,754 --> 00:29:03,776
You put that in
"The New York Times," Guy...

454
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,184
and I'm going to kill myself.

455
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:15,146
<i>Avi,</i>

456
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,277
<i>go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my class.</i>

457
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:20,320
Danny.

458
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:22,343
Daniel Balint!

459
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:24,216
Come back!

460
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,879
Is this it?

461
00:29:53,454 --> 00:29:55,113
Thought there was people here.

462
00:29:57,054 --> 00:29:59,020
I'll go look.

463
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,584
Hey, we're from New York.

464
00:30:11,654 --> 00:30:14,847
Curtis Zampf invited us.

465
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,750
Who?
I don't know no Curtis.

466
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,911
Then what are you all doing here?
Circle jerk?

467
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,646
Yeah, you want to join in?
You look pretty good.

468
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,346
I pitch.

469
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,343
- Whit.
- Billings.

470
00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,319
- Hi.
- Kyle.

471
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:33,886
Danny.

472
00:30:34,953 --> 00:30:36,647
Hey, how are you doing?

473
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:42,620
- Whoo!
- Damn.

474
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:46,051
Hey, motherfucker.
Welcome, fuckface.

475
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,915
Hey, come give me a kiss.

476
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,252
You're not in New York anymore.

477
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,584
Get up!

478
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:20,051
Get up!

479
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,509
Had enough? Huh?!

480
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,148
Which room was his room?

481
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,209
He had the small cabin down there.

482
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,711
Look, Hitler in '39 took out the RAF,

483
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,286
which he could've easily--
easily have done.

484
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:14,149
Then he could've taken England.
Then the US would never even--

485
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,243
The final staging ground
for the invasion.

486
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,979
But he didn't-- he blew it
by going after civilian targets.

487
00:32:19,054 --> 00:32:20,576
Just the way he blew it
on the Russian front--

488
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:23,552
- Stalingrad?
- Gettysburg.

489
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,075
We're re-fighting it
with World War I technology.

490
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,949
It's a fucking bloodbath.

491
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,013
It's about time somebody
kicked that guy's ass.

492
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,813
He's a fucking animal.

493
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,409
Not anymore.

494
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,009
You should've done it.

495
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:43,947
Yeah, right, like I could do
something like that.

496
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,111
Die, motherfucker.

497
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,413
You guys know anything about explosives?

498
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,081
Hell, yeah.

499
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:57,120
Good.

500
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,581
Now remember,
you control the gun.

501
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:03,484
Okay? A gun doesn't control you.
Relax.

502
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:06,781
Take a deep breath and let it out
as you pull the trigger.

503
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,682
Okay, again.

504
00:33:21,154 --> 00:33:22,915
Which one were you aiming at?

505
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,186
Father.

506
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,252
Check this guy out.

507
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,945
Hey, Drake.

508
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:45,379
Nice shooting.

509
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,147
The prisoner returns.

510
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,277
Danny!

511
00:34:28,354 --> 00:34:30,842
Help yourself to a drink.
I'll be there in a moment.

512
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:49,313
Why won't you talk to me?

513
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,218
- When can I see you?
- You can't.

514
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,410
I got to go see my father.

515
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,009
- I'm coming to your room tonight.
- No, you're not.

516
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,415
- I am whether you like it or not.
- Carla?

517
00:35:06,553 --> 00:35:08,383
Fine.

518
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,544
12:00.

519
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,643
But not through the house,
they'll hear you.

520
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,709
Use the porch roof.

521
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,018
I'll leave the window open.

522
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,342
Hey, I was just coming to say goodbye.

523
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,978
I'm going to Boston.
Convert the lefties.

524
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,781
- Where's Mrs. Moebius and, uh...
- Carla?

525
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:47,876
She left about an hour ago.

526
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,086
How soon could you be back
in the city?

527
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:53,847
About a week or so.

528
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,011
There's something I want to do
out here first.

529
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,949
Oh yeah?
What's that?

530
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,910
Make an impact.

531
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,713
Skater boys.

532
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,218
Nice board, kid.

533
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,079
I'll take the Pap smear to go.

534
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:31,881
- The gentile fish.
- Ooh, I like his hair.

535
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:34,646
Who does your hair?

536
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,948
- What's Drake having?
- He'll have the waiter.

537
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,508
- You guys know what you want?
- We sure do.

538
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:46,349
Could I get a ham and cheese...
on white?

539
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,182
We don't serve ham,
we don't serve cheese.

540
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:52,651
- Well, they serve white.
- What the fuck do you serve?

541
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,709
That's why you have the menus.

542
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,651
Could I have roast beef with Swiss?

543
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,777
- We don't serve cheese.
- What's wrong with cheese?

544
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:04,512
This is a kosher restaurant.
We don't serve meat with dairy.

545
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,813
What about with chicken?

546
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,476
Chicken's meat.

547
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:12,212
It says in the Bible you don't see
the kid in its mother's milk,

548
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:14,547
but chicken's don't give milk.

549
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,075
You guys want cheese that badly,
there's a pizza place next door.

550
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:20,642
- You can go there.
- Okay. It's stupid though, right?

551
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,515
I mean, admit that it's stupid.

552
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,313
You ever milk a chicken?

553
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,182
No, I won't admit it's stupid.

554
00:38:28,253 --> 00:38:31,015
You can have chicken with eggs
but you can't have it with milk?

555
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,949
Why is that?

556
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,508
- All right. Steve?
- Oh, Steve.

557
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,518
- Maybe Steve can explain it.
- Hi, Steve.

558
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,053
Steve, come over here.
You can explain this to us.

559
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,244
- Stevie boy.
- Stevie got a stick.

560
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,911
- I got a stick, too.
- No, no, no, let's ask him.

561
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,645
- Oh, sweetie.
- Hey.

562
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,174
- Got a problem here?
- We fucking do, bitch.

563
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:55,310
We don't understand
why you can't have chicken with milk.

564
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,852
It doesn't make sense.

565
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,750
Religion's not about making sense.

566
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,343
It's about the incomprehensible,
Steve. Not the idiotic.

567
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,015
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

568
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,813
That explains it.
Now we understand.

569
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,113
Don't point your fucking finger
in his face, understand?

570
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,981
Why don't you guys
just get out of here?

571
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,713
-... finger out of my face.
- My store.

572
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,481
Well...

573
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:26,315
since this fight seems to have been
instigated equally by both sides,

574
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,852
I'm going to give you a choice.

575
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,351
You can spend 30 days in jail,

576
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,875
or you can take
some sensitivity training

577
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:38,817
with some people whose experiences
have been different from yours.

578
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:42,418
When I refused to have sex with him,

579
00:39:42,853 --> 00:39:46,649
the warden ordered
my sister Esther shot...

580
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,550
right in front of me.

581
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,416
Everyone considered it my fault,
so after that, of course,

582
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,418
I did anything he wanted.

583
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,177
Who'd want to fuck her, anyway?

584
00:40:02,353 --> 00:40:04,182
I hear one more remark like that,

585
00:40:04,253 --> 00:40:07,708
and we go back to court for re-sentencing.
Sit down, please!

586
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:11,378
He was a pig like you,
so perhaps he had no taste.

587
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,645
Thank you, Mrs. Frankel.

588
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:21,145
The man was afraid to let us hide
on his farm any longer.

589
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:25,675
But he agreed to take us
to a more remote place.

590
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:28,275
But on the way,

591
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:30,512
we were stopped by a checkpoint.

592
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:35,107
When the soldiers found us in the hay,

593
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:39,609
one of them tried to take my son
out of my arms.

594
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,652
He began to cry, so I held onto him.

595
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,311
Not to refuse the soldier,
but simply--

596
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,944
simply to assure my son I was there.

597
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,918
But...

598
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,042
the sergeant became enraged.

599
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,051
He stuck his bayonet...

600
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,575
in my son's chest
and lifted him up impaled on it.

601
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,114
My son was three years old.

602
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,443
He held him so that
the blood spurting out of him

603
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,748
fell on my face.

604
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,609
Soldiers were laughing.

605
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:26,678
And when the blood stopped,

606
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:30,150
the sergeant pushed my son

607
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:33,014
off his bayonet and said...

608
00:41:35,053 --> 00:41:37,713
"There, you can have him now."

609
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,717
What'd you do?

610
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,115
What are you trying to say?

611
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,447
What did you do while the sergeant
was killing your son?

612
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,247
What could he have done?

613
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,478
What could he have done?

614
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:54,348
Sergeant's killing his kid.
What could he have done?!

615
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,909
He could've jumped the guy,
gouged his eyes out,

616
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:59,417
- grabbed his bayonet--
- They would've shot him.

617
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:01,681
He would've been dead in two seconds.

618
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:03,275
- Who are you to judge?
- So he's dead!

619
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:07,046
Big deal! He's worse than dead now.
He's a piece of shit!

620
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,608
Okay, that's it.
You're going back.

621
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,618
- What should he have done?
- Danny, don't listen to him.

622
00:42:11,653 --> 00:42:14,346
- It's all a bunch of crap.
- What's crap?

623
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,716
The so-called holocaust.
It never happened.

624
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,581
- Oh, please.
- It's true, Danny.

625
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:22,812
There was no six million.

626
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,545
At most, 200,000 Jews died in the camps,
and the majority--

627
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,882
Have you studied the deportation figures?

628
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,942
The Nazis kept records.

629
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:33,247
If Hitler didn't kill six million Jews,

630
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,581
why in the hell is he a hero?

631
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:39,008
He's got concentration camps
all over Europe,

632
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:42,213
and he only manages to get rid
of a measly 200,000?

633
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,978
- He's a fucking putz!
- Hitler wasn't a putz.

634
00:42:45,053 --> 00:42:48,747
Hitler was real.
God created him

635
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,115
to punish the Jews
for abandoning the Torah.

636
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:54,879
- For God's sakes, Chaim, not here.
- Remember who you're talking to.

637
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:56,975
It is you who are putzes.

638
00:42:57,053 --> 00:43:00,417
You little pishers...

639
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,917
with your dreams of hatred and killing.

640
00:43:02,952 --> 00:43:06,441
What do you think you would have done
if you had been there?

641
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,509
Not what he did.
Just stand there and watch?

642
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,883
How do you know?

643
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:13,544
You've never been tested like he has.

644
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,245
Here in this rich, safe,
stupid country

645
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:19,944
it is so easy to imagine oneself a hero.

646
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,350
But you have no idea what it was like.
You can't conceive of it.

647
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,477
Everything-- all of Europe--

648
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:31,451
was designed to break one's will.

649
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,975
Millions went to camps.
Many stronger, braver than you.

650
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:38,315
They did nothing,

651
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,648
just as you would have done nothing.

652
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,649
Where do you think you're going?

653
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,743
We have nothing to learn
from these people.

654
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,843
They should be learning from us.

655
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:55,317
And what should we learn from you, Daniel?

656
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:02,314
Kill your enemy.

657
00:44:05,153 --> 00:44:07,813
- What?
- Let me show you something.

658
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,312
- What is it?
- Black powder,

659
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,750
blasting caps,
3/4-inch galvanized pipe.

660
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,251
- Enough to blow up a lot of people.
- Good.

661
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,386
Hey, Danny.

662
00:44:20,053 --> 00:44:22,281
- Shit! Where's the light?
- Get off my fucking foot.

663
00:44:22,553 --> 00:44:24,416
- Get the fuck off my foot, man.
- Fuck you.

664
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,951
It's over here.

665
00:44:27,219 --> 00:44:28,878
Fucking shit.

666
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,710
Oooh.

667
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:43,115
- Jew world!
- Yeah! Whoo!

668
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:46,276
Pass! Pass!

669
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,478
- I'm open. Hit me!
- Yeah!

670
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:50,382
- Hey, over here, over here.
- Touchdown!

671
00:44:50,453 --> 00:44:52,112
Yeah, baby, yeah!

672
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,677
Come on, man!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

673
00:45:24,019 --> 00:45:27,213
Shut up. Fuck you.

674
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:30,149
What?

675
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,319
Nothing. What is it?

676
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:39,410
Let's take one of these panels off,
hook it under the bima.

677
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,181
Huh.

678
00:46:02,253 --> 00:46:05,083
Wow, man, look at this thing.

679
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,312
Hey, what are you guys doing?

680
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,486
Hey, hey, put it back.

681
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:15,679
- Hey.
- Put it back.

682
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:17,582
- Fore!
- Look at the fucking thing.

683
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:21,107
Oh man, it's like a treasure.

684
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,346
Look at this.

685
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:30,151
<i>If I were king of the forest</i>

686
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:32,515
<i>Not prince, not duke.</i>

687
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,643
All right, all right, it's set.

688
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:36,447
- It's set?
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,577
- Okay, we should go.
- Come look at this fucking thing.

690
00:46:39,653 --> 00:46:41,709
- Holy shit!
- Oh, that's weird.

691
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:43,649
- What the--
- They read right to left.

692
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:45,912
Look like squashed bugs.

693
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:48,951
- What kind of paper is this?
- Is it ink?

694
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:51,212
- Is it blood?
- No, they use soy, man.

695
00:46:51,319 --> 00:46:54,114
- Danny, you all right?
- Soy.

696
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:00,614
Neat calligraphy.

697
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,416
It's called the flame alphabet.

698
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,509
They think it's the word of God
written in fire.

699
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,643
- Cool.
- How come you know all this shit?

700
00:47:12,553 --> 00:47:13,813
How come you don't?

701
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,317
How can you say you hate Jews
if you don't know anything about 'em?

702
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,977
Fuck you. I hate the Jews
just as much as you do.

703
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:21,281
Really? What's shatnez?

704
00:47:21,353 --> 00:47:22,841
Tzitzith?

705
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:24,408
- Titties.
- What?

706
00:47:24,453 --> 00:47:26,180
- Tefillin?
- Who cares?

707
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:28,116
You know the kaddish
from the kiddish?

708
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,684
If you do hate something,
you study it so you know why you hate it.

709
00:47:30,752 --> 00:47:34,446
Eichmann? He studied the Torah,
the Talmud, the Mishnah--

710
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,509
the whole thing.
He hated Jews.

711
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,313
- Who's Eichmann?
- Who's Eichmann?

712
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,749
Eichmann was head
of the Gestapo's Jewish sector.

713
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,717
He deported people to the camps.

714
00:47:46,919 --> 00:47:50,511
- Hey, don't touch the letters.
- Why the fuck not?

715
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,415
- Just don't!
- Fucking asshole.

716
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,712
Did you see
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"?

717
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,842
What?

718
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:00,215
That was an ark, man.
That was a Torah.

719
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,512
They fucked around with it
and melted their faces.

720
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:06,017
- That was a movie, asshole.
- Go ahead, touch the letters.

721
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:13,342
- Touch the letters, I dare ya.
- Let me see.

722
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,079
Touch it, man.

723
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,147
Hey. Hey!

724
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:22,151
What do you think of that?!

725
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:25,481
Fuck you!

726
00:48:25,553 --> 00:48:29,746
Fuck them!
Fuck you!

727
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:36,082
Let's go.

728
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,876
Come on, man,
let's get the fuck out of here.

729
00:49:01,153 --> 00:49:03,346
Hey! Let's go!

730

<i>Everyone's wary out here
about what's going to happen next.</i>

- Guys! Get in here. This is it.

734
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:37,211
<i>How is it that tragedy and disaster
were averted in the Temple?</i>

735
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,944
<i>The power cell on the timer

00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:43,917
- Shit.

<i>13 is a mystical number

740
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:56,208
<i>We believe that God has 13 attributes</i>

741

<i>of which the highest is "Ain Sof,"</i>

742

743

<i>or sometimes it means,

00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:07,142
<i>"Nothingness without end."</i>

745
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:09,776
<i>Interesting.</i>

<i>It's the purest form of spirit.</i>

748
00:50:15,453 --> 00:50:17,043

Danny!

752
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:46,049
- What?
- Phone!

00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:57,917
- Hello.

00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:02,112
- Who's this?
- <i>It's Guy Danielsen.</i>

755
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:07,442
Whatever happened to your article?

756
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,644
<i>I couldn't get an editor to run it.</i>

757

<i>That was you, wasn't it, Danny?</i>

759
00:53:22,552 --> 00:53:24,541
Hey.

760
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,009
You want to kill a Jew?

761
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:33,112
It's right up there.

762
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:46,317
Just park around the corner
and we'll walk back.

763
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:59,818
There's the applause.
It must be over.

764
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:01,646
Lie on your stomach.

765
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:04,549
Come up on your elbows.

766
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,142
Why me?

767
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:09,548
'Cause you want to kill a Jew,
and I already did.

768
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:12,944
Really?

769
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:14,609
Who'd you kill?

770
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,412
Four of them.

771
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:19,145
But no one this important.

772
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:21,944
How'd you know they were Jews?

773
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:24,507
I can tell.

774
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:27,541
How?

775
00:54:27,619 --> 00:54:30,608
I was a Jew in a previous life.

776
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:34,341
- Thank you all very much.
- Here they come.

777
00:54:34,419 --> 00:54:38,216
Thank you.
Thank you again.

778
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:41,341
Shoot him in the head.
Always shoot a Jew in the head.

779
00:54:41,419 --> 00:54:44,908
- I'm a bad shot.
- Just keep him in the crosshairs.

780
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:49,980
Right there.

781
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:54,008
Squeeze the trigger... slowly.

782
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:55,814
- Do it.
- Good night, thank you again.

783
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,248
- Oh my God!
- Damn it!

784
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:00,546
- You missed on purpose.
- No, I didn't.

785
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:03,278
I had him in the crosshairs like you said.
I'm a bad shot.

786
00:55:03,352 --> 00:55:05,818
- What's this?
- What?

787
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:07,977
Fucking kike.
I knew it.

788
00:55:14,419 --> 00:55:16,351
It came from over there.

789
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:36,176
<i>The whole Jewish people
were permanently scarred</i>

790
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:40,117
<i>by what happened at Mount Moriah.
And we still live in terror.</i>

791
00:55:40,153 --> 00:55:42,016
Fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.

792
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,744
Fear of God makes you afraid
of everything.

793
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:48,376
All the Jews are good at
is being afraid and being sacrificed.

794
00:55:48,452 --> 00:55:51,179
Do you even believe in God?

795
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:53,980
I'm the only one who does believe.

796
00:55:54,053 --> 00:55:57,177
I see Him for the power-drunk madman
that He is.

797
00:55:57,252 --> 00:55:59,878
And we're supposed to worship such a deity?
I say never!

798
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:06,713
Avi, go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my class.

799
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:11,148
And you-- if you had come out of Egypt
you would have been destroyed

800
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:14,207
in the desert with all those
who worshipped the golden calf.

801
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:17,048
Then let Him destroy me now.

802
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,380
Let Him crush me like
the conceited bully that He is.

803
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:22,441
Go ahead.

804
00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:24,747
Danny!

805
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:26,978
Daniel Balint!

806
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,450
Come back!

807
00:56:48,218 --> 00:56:51,343
- How are things going?
- Fine.

808
00:56:51,419 --> 00:56:53,612
We'd like to talk to you about something.

809
00:56:55,919 --> 00:56:57,714
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

810
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:04,015
We are about to launch an aboveground,
intellectually serious,

811
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:06,017
fascist movement.

812
00:57:06,118 --> 00:57:09,118
We want to build bridges
to certain positions in politics.

813
00:57:09,118 --> 00:57:11,414
Works like
"The Bell Curve," "Sociobiology,"

814
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:13,246
"Earth First," "The Genome Project."

815
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:16,375
We want to have lectures,
invite blacks and Jews and liberals.

816
00:57:16,452 --> 00:57:18,816
Chomsky speaks, Stanley Crouch.

817
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:22,010
You know, I've been waiting my whole life
for something like this.

818
00:57:22,118 --> 00:57:24,516
We want you to help us run it.

819
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:27,414
Give speeches, lead seminars.

820
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:29,485
Handle the fundraising.

821
00:57:29,552 --> 00:57:31,518
Handle the fundraising?

822
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:34,017
We need someone with intelligence.

823
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,676
Well, what about the synagogues
and Manzetti and all of that?

824
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:40,547
We need intellectuals.
We have enough thugs.

825
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:42,380
I'm not an intellectual.

826
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:45,316
I read, but...

827
00:57:45,419 --> 00:57:48,317
fundraising, it's just-- it's--

828
00:57:48,352 --> 00:57:51,682
Danny, we want you to talk to people.

829
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:54,149
Can you do that for us?

830
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:58,650
Well yeah, sure, I can, you know...

831
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:01,582
Do you have a decent suit?

832
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,277
We'll get him one.

833
00:58:03,352 --> 00:58:05,443
We'll sort him out.
We'll...

834
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,212
get him a cell phone

835
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,511
and anything else he needs.

836
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,446
- Where'd you get this?
- Where'd I get what?

837
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:35,184
What are you doing?

838
00:59:35,252 --> 00:59:37,013
Where'd you get it?

839
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,542
I stole it from the synagogue.

840
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:43,309
Can you read it?

841
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:46,976
Look it, put something on.
You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.

842
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:49,678
Why not?

843
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:53,913
Because it's--
they think it's the word of God

844
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:56,007
and it's holy and the flesh isn't.

845
00:59:56,118 --> 00:59:58,880
That's stupid.

846
00:59:58,951 --> 01:00:01,782
Yes, it's stupid.
Put something on.

847
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:06,110
You see, the Jews love to separate things.

848
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:09,508
Holy from the profane,
the meat from the milk,

849
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,778
wool from the linen,
Sabbath from the week,

850
01:00:11,852 --> 01:00:15,579
Jew from the gentile,
as if one little scrap of this

851
01:00:15,652 --> 01:00:17,641
is going to completely
contaminate that.

852
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:20,746
Who gets contaminated,

853
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:23,080
the Jews or the gentiles?

854
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:26,448
That's a good question.

855
01:00:27,552 --> 01:00:29,541
How come there's no punctuation?

856
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:35,416
That was a later invention,
and, you know,

857
01:00:35,452 --> 01:00:38,247
Jews don't really need it because
they know the whole thing by heart.

858
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:40,511
Every word and every letter.

859
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:43,016
Do you know it like that?

860
01:00:43,118 --> 01:00:45,016
By heart?

861
01:00:45,052 --> 01:00:46,712
No.

862
01:00:46,819 --> 01:00:48,977
But you can read it, right?

863
01:00:49,052 --> 01:00:50,575
The Hebrew?

864
01:00:51,819 --> 01:00:54,444
- What do you care?
- Because I want to know.

865
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:58,045
What's this word?

866
01:00:58,118 --> 01:00:59,913
Don't touch it.

867
01:01:00,018 --> 01:01:01,916
Um... that's...

868
01:01:02,018 --> 01:01:03,416
"vayomar."

869
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:08,147
"And he said."

870
01:01:08,218 --> 01:01:10,241
What did he say?

871
01:01:26,652 --> 01:01:28,049
What does it mean?

872
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:31,516
"And God said to Avraham,

873
01:01:31,552 --> 01:01:33,881
'Take yourself away from your land,

874
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,974
away from the place you were born,
away from your father's house...

875
01:01:38,918 --> 01:01:42,476
and go to a new land,
a place that I will show you.'"

876
01:01:44,818 --> 01:01:46,648
I want you to teach it to me.

877
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,850
Why?

878
01:01:50,918 --> 01:01:53,612
Know your enemy.

879
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:58,309
Because it's a basic text
of Western culture,

880
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:01,442
and I want to read it
in the original, okay?

881
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:05,281
Listen, it's extremely difficult.
It would take you years to learn it.

882
01:02:05,352 --> 01:02:07,318
I'm good at languages.

883
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:16,115
Okay.

884
01:02:16,218 --> 01:02:19,412
Will you get that piece of paper
and that pen over there?

885
01:02:27,818 --> 01:02:30,909
- Aleph.
- It looks like a little swastika.

886
01:02:31,018 --> 01:02:32,541
Huh?

887
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:35,642
It's silent and it takes a vowel.
There aren't any vowels,

888
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:38,207
they're just like little dots
that go underneath the letters.

889
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:40,477
I'll get you a chumash.

890
01:02:43,419 --> 01:02:45,180
- Bet.
- Bet.

891
01:02:46,519 --> 01:02:47,779
- Gimmel.
- Gimmel.

892
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:51,417
- Dalet.
- Dalet.

893
01:02:51,452 --> 01:02:53,350
- Hey.
- Hey.

894
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,516
How come you're here
and not with Curtis?

895
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:00,517
And don't say it's 'cause
of the free Hebrew lesson.

896
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,642
Sex is better.

897
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:08,543
Even though he's--
he's got such a big dick?

898
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:12,715
Well, with you there's a tragic dimension.

899
01:03:20,218 --> 01:03:22,979
How many of you consider yourself
anti-Semites?

900
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,146
Good.

901
01:03:27,218 --> 01:03:28,945
Actually the term's a bit imprecise,

902
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:31,314
seeing as Jews are only one
of the Semitic peoples.

903
01:03:31,419 --> 01:03:34,613
But for our purposes,
we'll say that an anti-Semite

904
01:03:34,718 --> 01:03:38,151
is someone that hates
or is against Jews.

905
01:03:39,818 --> 01:03:41,512
Why do we hate 'em?

906
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,311
Let me put it this way...

907
01:03:44,419 --> 01:03:47,816
do we hate them 'cause
they go where they don't belong?

908
01:03:49,018 --> 01:03:52,416
Or do we hate them 'cause
they're clannish and keep to themselves?

909
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:55,679
'Cause they're tight with money,
or 'cause they flash it around?

910
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:58,717
'Cause they're Bolsheviks
or because they're capitalists?

911
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:02,411
'Cause they have the highest IQs
or the most active sex lives?

912
01:04:03,619 --> 01:04:06,016
You want to know the real reason
why we hate 'em?

913
01:04:07,118 --> 01:04:09,050
'Cause we hate 'em.

914
01:04:09,118 --> 01:04:11,141
'Cause they exist.

915
01:04:11,218 --> 01:04:14,480
'Cause it's an axiom of civilization
that just as man longs for woman,

916
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:17,881
loves his children and fears death,
he hates Jews.

917
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:21,315
There's no reason.
And if there were,

918
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:23,976
some smart-ass kike would try
and come up with an argument,

919
01:04:24,052 --> 01:04:27,143
try and prove us wrong,
which would only make us hate them even more.

920
01:04:27,218 --> 01:04:30,343
Really, we have all the reasons we need
in three simple letters.

921
01:04:30,419 --> 01:04:32,941
J-E-W.

922
01:04:33,018 --> 01:04:35,507
Jew. You say it a million times,

923
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:37,813
it's the only word
that never loses its meaning.

924
01:04:37,918 --> 01:04:40,384
Jew, Jew, Jew.

925
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:44,441
Jew. Jew. Jew, Jew, Jew,
Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew!

926
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,081
I'll give your group 1,000 bucks.

927
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:55,450
You gave 50,000 to that college magazine.

928
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:58,007
Things were possible then
that aren't now.

929
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:02,916
I actually feel this moment
has a lot of possibilities.

930
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:04,678
I read your piece.

931
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:07,377
It's very smart... and very wrong.

932
01:05:07,452 --> 01:05:09,418
In what ways?

933
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:13,043
Forget the Jewish stuff.
It doesn't play anymore.

934
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,879
There's only the market now,
and it doesn't care who you are.

935
01:05:17,718 --> 01:05:19,946
People still need values and beliefs.

936
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:22,348
No, they don't.
Not the smart ones.

937
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,748
Look...

938
01:05:24,818 --> 01:05:28,512
I'll give you five grand
if you can document your tax exempt status.

939
01:05:29,618 --> 01:05:32,176
But when you fall off this horse,
come see me.

940
01:05:32,252 --> 01:05:34,649
I can show you how
to make a lot of money.

941
01:05:34,718 --> 01:05:36,707
I don't care about money.

942
01:05:38,052 --> 01:05:39,608
You will.

943
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:43,114
You're a Jew.

944
01:05:44,218 --> 01:05:45,649
You may not realize it,
but you are.

945
01:05:45,718 --> 01:05:48,412
Maybe I am.
Maybe we're all Jews now.

946
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:50,007
What's the difference?

947
01:05:58,551 --> 01:06:00,676
What about Drake?

948
01:06:00,751 --> 01:06:02,183
Did he ever show up?

949
01:06:02,252 --> 01:06:04,740
No, man, it's weird.
No one's seen him.

950
01:06:04,818 --> 01:06:08,716
This is going to be a completely
different kind of device, okay?

951
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:12,309
Stupid thing.
Do you have any idea how that made me look

952
01:06:12,419 --> 01:06:13,816
in front of Curtis and Lina?

953
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,611
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again, okay?

954
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:18,912
I got a brand new timer
plus a backup power source.

955
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,246
Gotta kill some Jews.

956
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:24,579
That's all I ever talk about,

957
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:26,140
and this time it's got to happen.

958
01:06:26,218 --> 01:06:28,116
It will.

959
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:33,150
You should go.

960
01:08:13,318 --> 01:08:15,875
<i>On Shabbos, is it permitted
to pick up the phone</i>

961
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:17,473
<i>if it's been ringing long?</i>

962
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:19,142
<i>No. It could be a wrong number.</i>

963
01:08:19,218 --> 01:08:21,116
<i>But if you think it might be
a relative needing help,</i>

964
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:23,649
<i>you should knock the phone
off the hook with your elbow</i>

965
01:08:23,718 --> 01:08:25,547
<i>and listen to see
who's on the line.</i>

966
01:08:32,118 --> 01:08:33,811
<i>May we peel oranges on Shabbos?</i>

967
01:08:40,252 --> 01:08:42,740
Danny?

968
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,307
Danny.

969
01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:46,941
Hey! It's Stuart.

970
01:08:47,018 --> 01:08:49,506
Schoenbaum. Schlomo.

971
01:08:52,118 --> 01:08:54,640
- Schlomo.
- Danny. God...

972
01:08:54,718 --> 01:08:57,707
God, it's been years.

973
01:09:03,218 --> 01:09:05,047
How you doing?
What are you doing?

974
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:08,141
I'm doing great.
I'm at the rabbinic program up at JTS.

975
01:09:09,718 --> 01:09:12,014
- JTS.
- What are you doing?

976
01:09:12,118 --> 01:09:13,640
Something strange I bet.

977
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,379
No, just-- it's kind
of an underground thing.

978
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:20,417
Like an artist?

979
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:22,644
No, uh...

980
01:09:22,718 --> 01:09:24,809
like a private business.

981
01:09:26,551 --> 01:09:28,346
Hey, you remember Miriam.

982
01:09:30,018 --> 01:09:31,415
Yeah.

983
01:09:31,518 --> 01:09:32,882
Hey.

984
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:35,076
- Hey.
- She's at Yale Law now,

985
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:36,845
interning for the District Attorney.

986
01:09:36,918 --> 01:09:39,180
We're getting married
next spring in Jerusalem.

987
01:09:41,118 --> 01:09:42,175
That's great.

988
01:09:42,252 --> 01:09:45,013
Maybe Danny'd like to come
to the minyan for Rosh Hashanah.

989
01:09:45,118 --> 01:09:48,107
Great idea. We're davening
with a group from the seminary.

990
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:52,309
Guess who comes? Avi.
You two can go at it like you used to.

991
01:09:52,418 --> 01:09:54,680
Danny and Avi used to argue
about everything.

992
01:09:54,751 --> 01:09:57,842
Talmud, Torah, politics, girls--

993
01:09:57,918 --> 01:10:00,043
- It always ended in a fistfight.
- I remember.

994
01:10:00,118 --> 01:10:03,413
- I always won.
- The arguments, anyway.

995
01:10:04,518 --> 01:10:06,950
Here, it's up at KI,
up on 101st.

996
01:10:07,018 --> 01:10:08,813
Try to make it.

997
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:10,315
It could be fun.

998
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,941
Yeah.

999
01:10:17,118 --> 01:10:20,345
<i>My country 'tis of thee</i>

1000
01:10:20,418 --> 01:10:23,873
<i>Sweet land of liberty</i>

1001
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:27,439
<i>Of thee I sing.</i>

1002
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:00,118
"To make no graven image of the Lord

1003
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:03,445
or the form of any figure
or of man or woman

1004
01:11:03,518 --> 01:11:06,507
or of anything
that looks like anything,

1005
01:11:06,551 --> 01:11:08,517
because He's not like anything."

1006
01:11:08,618 --> 01:11:11,448
Not only can you not
see Him or hear Him,

1007
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:14,575
but you can't even think about Him?

1008
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:18,175
What's the difference between that
and Him not existing at all?

1009
01:11:20,118 --> 01:11:22,276
There's no difference.

1010
01:11:23,718 --> 01:11:27,616
Christianity's silly, but at least
there's something to believe in.

1011
01:11:27,651 --> 01:11:29,514
Or not believe.

1012
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,550
I mean, Judaism there's nothing.

1013
01:11:31,618 --> 01:11:33,777
Nothing but nothingness.

1014
01:11:35,018 --> 01:11:37,381
Judaism's not really about belief.

1015
01:11:37,451 --> 01:11:39,974
It's about doing things.

1016
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:42,177
Keeping the Sabbath,
lighting candles,

1017
01:11:42,251 --> 01:11:44,217
visiting the sick.

1018
01:11:44,251 --> 01:11:47,240
And belief follows?

1019
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:49,749
Nothing follows.

1020
01:11:50,818 --> 01:11:53,477
You don't do it because
it's smart or it's stupid.

1021
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:56,415
You don't do it because you get saved,
because nobody gets saved.

1022
01:11:56,518 --> 01:11:59,507
You do it because the Torah tells you to
and you submit to the Torah.

1023
01:11:59,618 --> 01:12:01,379
That is fucked.

1024
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:03,815
Don't swear in front of it, okay?

1025
01:12:03,918 --> 01:12:06,406
- Why should I submit?
- You shouldn't.

1026
01:12:09,418 --> 01:12:12,543
You think I should
just because there's no reason?

1027
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:15,141
I think you shouldn't.

1028
01:12:15,217 --> 01:12:19,343
Judaism doesn't need a God.
You have the Torah. That's your fucking God.

1029
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,577
The book's closed.

1030
01:12:27,317 --> 01:12:30,113
I think your Hebrew's
getting real good.

1031
01:12:30,217 --> 01:12:33,274
I told you I was good at this.

1032
01:12:33,351 --> 01:12:36,476
You also have nothing else
to do all day, so...

1033
01:12:36,551 --> 01:12:40,313
Are you saying I learned it
better and faster than you did?

1034
01:12:42,118 --> 01:12:43,947
Maybe it's because I'm smarter.

1035
01:12:45,251 --> 01:12:47,217
You think that's funny?

1036
01:12:47,317 --> 01:12:50,113
You think Jews are the only smart ones?

1037
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,314
You think I'm Jewish?

1038
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:59,010
It's all you ever talk about.
Jewish, Jewish, Jewish.

1039
01:12:59,117 --> 01:13:02,743
Only people that ever talk
about it that much are Jews.

1040
01:13:02,818 --> 01:13:05,181
Nazis talk about it all the time.

1041
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:07,308
Do they?

1042
01:13:07,418 --> 01:13:09,350
Real ones.

1043
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:12,441
Hitler and Goebbels,
they talked about it incessantly.

1044
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,814
Is that why you became a Nazi,

1045
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:17,440
to talk about Jews incessantly?

1046
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:20,450
- You want a punch in the mouth?
- Okay.

1047
01:13:25,718 --> 01:13:28,014
Let's light candles on Friday

1048
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:29,583
and say the kaddish.

1049
01:13:31,918 --> 01:13:33,713
Kaddish is a prayer for the dead.

1050
01:13:33,818 --> 01:13:37,046
Kiddish.
Say the kiddish.

1051
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:39,413
Light candles.

1052
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,515
Come on.
We could shave my head,

1053
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:46,779
fuck through a sheet--
all that stuff.

1054
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:50,110
Let's just try it.

1055
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:14,711
He said to him, "Abraham."

1056
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,943
And then he answered,
"Here I am."

1057
01:14:17,018 --> 01:14:19,540
Then he said,
"Take your son, your only son...

1058
01:14:19,618 --> 01:14:22,379
whom you love, Isaac..."

1059
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:24,610
It's not his only son.

1060
01:14:24,718 --> 01:14:26,684
It's the only one he loves.

1061
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:28,774
- Hey, Avi.
- Hey.

1062
01:14:30,418 --> 01:14:32,577
You only kill the ones you love,
is that right?

1063
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:35,015
What are you doing here?
I thought you were an anti-Semite.

1064
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:36,879
- Would you grow up?
- He's a skinhead.

1065
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:39,280
It's just a style.
Avi, there are anti-racist skins.

1066
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,874
Danny's the racist kind.
You a fascist, Danny?

1067
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:46,008
- He thinks the Jews are wimps.
- What's a fascist?

1068
01:14:46,117 --> 01:14:48,174
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi.
He always was.

1069
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:50,717
- Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
- The Zionists are not Nazis.

1070
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:54,205
They're racist, and act like
Stormtroopers in the territories.

1071
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:57,649
And do you hate them because
they're wimps or Stormtroopers?

1072
01:14:57,718 --> 01:15:00,946
- They have no extermination camps.
- They have Sabra and Shattila.

1073
01:15:01,017 --> 01:15:02,779
- Do you just hate them?
- That wasn't genocide,

1074
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:05,646
that was the Lebanese killing each other.
The Israelis knew nothing.

1075
01:15:05,718 --> 01:15:08,741
They knew-- Sharon encouraged
the Falangists to murder them.

1076
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:11,249
- We don't know that.
- Ever read "The New York Times"?

1077
01:15:11,317 --> 01:15:13,943
It was a war. People get killed.
I want to know why the Jews

1078
01:15:14,017 --> 01:15:17,313
- are held to a higher standard.
- Because we're the chosen people.

1079
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:19,884
Isn't that right, Daniel?
Isn't that right?

1080
01:15:19,951 --> 01:15:24,110
Read early Zionist and European Jewry.
They sound like Goebbels.

1081
01:15:24,217 --> 01:15:25,183
They sound like you.

1082
01:15:25,251 --> 01:15:27,717
Just how Nazis did everything
Hitler told them,

1083
01:15:27,751 --> 01:15:30,478
- you do what the Torah tells you--
- Stop!

1084
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:33,108
- It's identical slave mentality.
- We don't want that in here.

1085
01:15:33,217 --> 01:15:36,149
- Shhh!
- Not in shul.

1086
01:15:36,217 --> 01:15:38,877
Why'd you come tonight?
To see me?

1087
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:41,441
To study Torah.

1088
01:15:41,518 --> 01:15:43,746
I thought you hated Torah.

1089
01:15:43,818 --> 01:15:45,613
Doesn't mean I don't like to study it.

1090
01:15:45,685 --> 01:15:48,242
Expose all the lies
and fucked up thinking.

1091
01:15:50,518 --> 01:15:53,313
You know the joke,
a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island?

1092
01:15:53,384 --> 01:15:55,907
When they rescue him they see
he's built two synagogues.

1093
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,212
They say,
"For what you build two synagogues?"

1094
01:15:58,284 --> 01:16:00,011
He says,
"One to pray in,

1095
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:04,176
and one to never set foot in
so long as I live, so help me God."

1096
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:08,273
You pray in the one
you'd never set foot in...

1097
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:10,542
and vice versa.

1098
01:16:11,718 --> 01:16:13,479
This is me.

1099
01:16:17,117 --> 01:16:19,947
Tell me about Lina Moebius.

1100
01:16:20,017 --> 01:16:22,643
- How did you know about Lina?
- I work in the DA's office.

1101
01:16:22,718 --> 01:16:25,445
You go to those meetings,
half the people there are informants.

1102
01:16:26,685 --> 01:16:28,583
Like who, that "Times" guy?

1103
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:32,048
- Which "Times" guy?
- There's more than one?

1104
01:16:34,685 --> 01:16:36,480
- Fuck.
- Be careful.

1105
01:16:42,151 --> 01:16:45,208
Half the right-wing money in New York
is here tonight.

1106
01:16:45,284 --> 01:16:47,512
They've come to see you.

1107
01:16:47,584 --> 01:16:49,743
If you impress them...

1108
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:51,078
if you do what I know you can,

1109
01:16:51,151 --> 01:16:53,617
this movement will be up
and running by tomorrow.

1110
01:16:53,685 --> 01:16:55,912
And we will be on the front page

1111
01:16:55,984 --> 01:16:58,882
of "The New York Times" in six months.

1112
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:01,246
- Here he is.
- Is that him?

1113
01:17:04,117 --> 01:17:06,174
Balint. Daniel Balint.

1114
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:30,312
- Does anyone know what that is?
- A Jewish prayer.

1115
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:34,907
Do you have any idea
why I would say a Jewish prayer?

1116
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,815
Because you're a Jew.

1117
01:17:37,884 --> 01:17:40,043
That could be one reason.
What's another?

1118
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:44,779
Let me put it this way--

1119
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:47,180
who wants to destroy the Jews?

1120
01:17:48,651 --> 01:17:52,048
Who wants to grind their bones
into the dust?

1121
01:17:52,117 --> 01:17:54,208
Who wants to see them rise again?

1122
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:56,974
Wealthier, more successful,

1123
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:59,574
powerful, cultured,
more intelligent than ever.

1124
01:17:59,651 --> 01:18:03,083
You know what we have to do?

1125
01:18:06,785 --> 01:18:08,909
We have to love 'em.

1126
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,416
What?
Did he say love the Jews?

1127
01:18:11,484 --> 01:18:13,881
It's strange, I know.

1128
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:15,780
But with these people,
nothing is simple.

1129
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:19,805
The Jew says all he wants is
to be left alone to study his Torah,

1130
01:18:19,884 --> 01:18:21,783
do a little business,

1131
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:25,146
fornicate with his oversexed wife,
but it's not true.

1132
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:27,308
He wants to be hated.

1133
01:18:28,518 --> 01:18:30,484
He longs for our scorn.

1134
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:34,142
He clings to it as if it were
the very core of his being.

1135
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:38,206
If Hitler had not existed,
the Jews would have invented him.

1136
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,816
For without such hatred,

1137
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:44,816
the so-called chosen people
would vanish from the earth.

1138
01:18:46,117 --> 01:18:48,049
And this reveals a terrible truth,

1139
01:18:48,117 --> 01:18:50,549
and really the crux
of our problem as Nazis.

1140
01:18:50,618 --> 01:18:51,641
The worse the Jews are treated,

1141
01:18:51,718 --> 01:18:53,650
the stronger they become.

1142
01:18:53,718 --> 01:18:55,741
Egyptian slavery made them a nation,

1143
01:18:55,817 --> 01:18:57,976
the pogroms hardened them,

1144
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:00,108
Auschwitz gave birth
to the State of Israel.

1145
01:19:01,484 --> 01:19:04,450
Suffering, it seems,
is the very crucible of their genius.

1146
01:19:04,518 --> 01:19:07,718
So if the Jews are,
as one of their own has said,

1147
01:19:07,718 --> 01:19:10,377
a people who will not
take yes for an answer,

1148
01:19:11,551 --> 01:19:13,642
let us say yes to them.

1149
01:19:13,718 --> 01:19:17,309
They thrive on opposition?
Let us cease to oppose them.

1150
01:19:17,384 --> 01:19:22,112
The only way to annihilate this
insidious people once and for all

1151
01:19:22,184 --> 01:19:24,013
is to open our arms,

1152
01:19:24,084 --> 01:19:26,016
invite them into our homes,

1153
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:28,448
and embrace them.

1154
01:19:28,518 --> 01:19:30,949
Only then will they vanish
into assimilation,

1155
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:32,949
normality and love.

1156
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:34,983
But we cannot pretend.

1157
01:19:35,051 --> 01:19:37,176
The Jew is nothing if not clever.

1158
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:40,842
He will see through
hypocrisy and condescension.

1159
01:19:41,984 --> 01:19:43,610
To destroy him

1160
01:19:43,685 --> 01:19:46,173
we must love him sincerely.

1161
01:19:47,685 --> 01:19:49,775
Yes.

1162
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:52,681
If the Jews are strengthened by hate,

1163
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:55,716
then wouldn't this "destruction"
that you speak of,

1164
01:19:55,784 --> 01:19:58,307
whether it's by love
or any other means,

1165
01:19:58,384 --> 01:20:01,680
wouldn't that make them more powerful
than they are already?

1166
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,148
Yes. Infinitely more.

1167
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:06,615
They would become as God.

1168
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:13,212
Look it, it's the Jews' destiny to be
annihilated so they can be deified.

1169
01:20:13,284 --> 01:20:16,409
Jesus understood this perfectly.

1170
01:20:16,484 --> 01:20:20,041
Look what was accomplished with the death
of just one enlightened Jew.

1171
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:23,174
Imagine what would happen
if we killed them all?

1172
01:20:24,484 --> 01:20:26,643
So let us say together...

1173
01:20:30,017 --> 01:20:32,074
Are you out of your mind?!

1174
01:20:32,151 --> 01:20:34,208
I was just making a point.

1175
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:38,678
What point?

1176
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:43,316
I do not want you
working for us anymore.

1177
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:44,940
Lina!

1178
01:20:45,017 --> 01:20:46,710
Lina, come here!

1179
01:20:46,784 --> 01:20:49,580
<i>According to the police,
he had just left the restaurant</i>

1180
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,139
<i>and was walking a block and a half
back to his office</i>

1181
01:20:52,217 --> 01:20:54,410
<i>when the gunman
stepped out of this doorway,</i>

1182
01:20:54,484 --> 01:20:56,313
<i>fired seven times at point blank range,</i>

1183
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:59,475
<i>then fled on foot.
Paramedics arrived within 90 seconds,</i>

1184
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:02,574
<i>but Mr. Manzetti was declared dead
here at the scene.</i>

1185
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:06,447
<i>The assailant is described
as a white male in his 20s...</i>

1186
01:21:07,518 --> 01:21:10,382
- You think that I...
- Danny...

1187
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:12,212
we don't want to know.

1188
01:21:25,984 --> 01:21:27,745
Hey, Mr. Manzetti.

1189
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,014
Hey, Mr. Manzetti.

1190
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,809
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?

1191
01:21:58,117 --> 01:22:00,639
Lina Moebius is saying
the whole thing was your idea.

1192
01:22:00,717 --> 01:22:03,115
She said you proposed it
at a meeting at her house.

1193
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,514
Oh, Jesus, Danny.

1194
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:08,913
- I can't help what I think.
- You don't think that.

1195
01:22:08,984 --> 01:22:11,314
- I don't?
- Tell me you think it.

1196
01:22:12,484 --> 01:22:15,211
Are you glad Manzetti's dead?
You really want to kill Jews?

1197
01:22:15,284 --> 01:22:16,874
You want to kill me?

1198
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:23,883
What if all along,
you were actually

1199
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:26,075
infiltrating the Nazis
to expose them?

1200
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:27,946
- I wasn't.
- And killing Manzetti

1201
01:22:28,017 --> 01:22:30,313
was just to convince them
you were a real anti-Semite.

1202
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:32,543
If you had any idea somebody'd
actually shoot the guy--

1203
01:22:32,617 --> 01:22:36,709
- It's not true.
- Think about your father, Linda.

1204
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:39,273
You don't care
about the truth at all, do you?

1205
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:40,907
Danny, I'm trying to save you.

1206
01:22:40,984 --> 01:22:43,677
Fucking...

1207
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,239
kike!

1208
01:22:57,717 --> 01:22:59,683
I need you to get
Lina Moebius on tape...

1209
01:23:02,451 --> 01:23:04,939
telling you to do something.
Something violent.

1210
01:23:05,017 --> 01:23:07,517
I don't care about the truth.

1211
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:09,347
I care about you.

1212
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:12,780
Kol Nidre's at 6:30.

1213
01:23:12,850 --> 01:23:15,180
I got to meet Stuart.
Come there if you need me.

1214
01:23:37,617 --> 01:23:39,640
What is this?

1215
01:23:39,717 --> 01:23:41,649
It's Erev Yom Kippur.

1216
01:23:41,717 --> 01:23:43,945
We'll have dinner, then go to shul.

1217
01:23:44,017 --> 01:23:46,245
Atone for our sins.

1218
01:23:49,117 --> 01:23:50,878
Come on, we can be like Eichmann.

1219
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:54,416
He studied Torah, he hated Jews.

1220
01:23:56,151 --> 01:23:58,844
Is it like Eichmann?
Are you just goofing?

1221
01:24:01,051 --> 01:24:02,539
I don't know.

1222
01:24:02,617 --> 01:24:05,674
- I just wanted to try it.
- Why?

1223
01:24:07,284 --> 01:24:09,273
Because God commands it?

1224
01:24:09,351 --> 01:24:11,010
I thought God didn't exist.

1225
01:24:13,817 --> 01:24:16,283
He commands it
whether He exists or not.

1226
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:20,748
Look, we can fight Him
and be crushed,

1227
01:24:20,817 --> 01:24:22,976
or we can submit.

1228
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:24,244
And be crushed.

1229
01:24:24,317 --> 01:24:26,612
But what if...

1230
01:24:26,684 --> 01:24:30,208
what if submitting, being crushed,

1231
01:24:30,284 --> 01:24:32,613
being nothing, not mattering--

1232
01:24:32,684 --> 01:24:36,139
what if that's the best feeling
we can have?

1233
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,879
Look, just light the candles with me.

1234
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,939
You know, then we can eat.
You have to eat.

1235
01:24:44,017 --> 01:24:46,642
You eat first,
then you light the candles.

1236
01:24:46,717 --> 01:24:48,910
'Cause once you light the candles

1237
01:24:48,984 --> 01:24:51,109
it's Yom Kippur and you're fasting.

1238
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:01,241
I got to go.

1239
01:25:05,817 --> 01:25:07,007
<i>Miriam, pick up the phone.</i>

1240
01:25:07,099 --> 01:25:08,977
The holiday hasn't even started yet.

1241
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:10,017
Pick up-- hello?

1242
01:25:10,884 --> 01:25:13,873
Stuart's davening Ne'ilah
tomorrow, right?

1243
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:16,609
'Cause he always does.

1244
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:18,445
Tell him I'm doing it instead.

1245
01:25:18,517 --> 01:25:20,745
I'm davening.

1246
01:25:20,817 --> 01:25:23,942
Tell him if he gives me any trouble,
I'll beat the shit out of him.

1247
01:25:24,017 --> 01:25:26,744
- Did you kill Manzetti?
- No, I didn't kill Manzetti.

1248
01:25:26,817 --> 01:25:28,715
Drake did.

1249
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:34,910
Is this 60th?
Turn here. Turn right.

1250
01:25:34,984 --> 01:25:36,506
- Why? Why?
- Just do it.

1251
01:25:38,784 --> 01:25:40,773
Why so fast? Would you relax?

1252
01:25:53,217 --> 01:25:55,274
- What time should it go off?
- Shh, shh, shh.

1253
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,078
7:30 tomorrow night.

1254
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:02,913
7:30 tomorrow. 19:30 minus...

1255
01:26:02,984 --> 01:26:04,711
Shh, shh.

1256
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:15,811
- Hand me the tape.
- Here.

1257
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:20,077
It's all reinforced in here.
It won't blow out the way we want it.

1258
01:26:20,151 --> 01:26:22,174
Look, I know this guy
at a lumberyard.

1259
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:24,773
- I can get some dynamite.
- No.

1260
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,248
It has to be tomorrow.
It's gonna be fine,

1261
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:29,306
as long as it blow up the pulpit.

1262
01:26:29,383 --> 01:26:32,111
- It's not going to blow out--
- Do it.

1263
01:27:17,884 --> 01:27:20,941
<i>Ilio Manzetti was one
of the most respected</i>

1264
01:27:21,017 --> 01:27:23,176
<i>and influential men in New York.</i>

1265
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:25,217
<i>As an investment banker, diplomat,</i>

1266
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,113
<i>advisor to presidents and mayors,</i>

1267
01:27:27,184 --> 01:27:29,581
<i>he helped shape public
and private policy</i>

1268
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:32,242
<i>for more than three decades.</i>

1269
01:27:32,316 --> 01:27:34,874
<i>He'll be missed, though.
This is Michael Porter</i>

1270
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,506
<i>for New York 1.</i>

1271
01:27:37,817 --> 01:27:40,942
<i>You're saying that when
he first appeared at your house,</i>

1272
01:27:41,017 --> 01:27:43,380
<i>you had no idea that he was Jewish?</i>

1273
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:46,974
<i>None whatsoever. But I can't say
I'm terribly surprised.</i>

1274
01:27:47,051 --> 01:27:49,176
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1275
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:52,046
<i>I think anti-Semitism today
is largely a Jewish phenomenon.</i>

1276
01:27:52,117 --> 01:27:53,412
<i>Wouldn't you agree?</i>

1277
01:27:54,817 --> 01:27:57,840
<i>In the Third Reich,
weren't a number of high ranking Nazis</i>

1278
01:27:57,917 --> 01:27:59,280
<i>of Jewish origin?</i>

1279
01:28:06,117 --> 01:28:07,912
Gut yontiff.

1280
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:26,841
He said to him,
"You have brought this misfortune upon us.

1281
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:29,110
What is your business?
Where have you come from?

1282
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,843
What is your country
and of what people are you?"

1283
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:34,747
"I am a Hebrew," he replied.
"I worship the Lord,

1284
01:28:34,817 --> 01:28:37,612
the God of Heaven
who made both sea and land."

1285
01:28:37,684 --> 01:28:39,650
Hey.

1286
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:46,043
- What are you doing here?
- Miriam called looking for you.

1287
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:48,309
- She told me about the service.
- Would you be quiet?

1288
01:28:48,383 --> 01:28:51,781
- I thought you'd come.
- You got to go, okay?

1289
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,043
Look, I understand you want to daven,

1290
01:28:54,117 --> 01:28:56,049
- but these people--
- Stuart, shut up.

1291
01:28:56,117 --> 01:28:59,412
Danny, please.

1292
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:02,415
Listen, you have to leave.

1293
01:29:02,483 --> 01:29:04,449
- Young man, please!
- Shhh!

1294
01:29:04,517 --> 01:29:08,643
- Hey.
- Can you take this outside?

1295
01:29:08,717 --> 01:29:12,205
- You're leaving, that's it.
- I'm trying to read this, okay?

1296
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:15,079
What must we do to you
to make the sea calm around us?

1297
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,673
For the sea was growing
more and more stormy.

1298
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:21,204
He answered, "Heave me overboard
and the sea will calm down for you,

1299
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:24,943
for I know that this terrible storm
came upon you on my account."

1300
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:53,709
Let me talk to him.

1301
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:57,213
Danny, the congregation
is expecting me to daven.

1302
01:29:57,283 --> 01:29:59,215
They don't want someone
they don't know.

1303
01:29:59,283 --> 01:30:01,511
Stuart, I got to do this.

1304
01:30:08,884 --> 01:30:10,474
Page 450.

1305
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:25,572
Jesus Christ, you know who that is?
You see the paper?

1306
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:27,741
You read the paper on Yom Kippur, Barry?

1307
01:30:27,817 --> 01:30:29,373
I saw the paper.
That's not him.

1308
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:31,848
This guy was at Rosh Hashanah
with Stuart and Miriam.

1309
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:35,280
- That guy would never go to shul.
- You want to bet?

1310
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:39,146
- I'm going to go get a cop.
- Fine, get a cop.

1311
01:30:40,383 --> 01:30:42,679
I'm sure it's him.

1312
01:31:59,983 --> 01:32:02,643
- Why's he stopping?
- You got to go.

1313
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,444
You wanted to daven, now daven.

1314
01:32:04,517 --> 01:32:06,142
- There's a bomb.
- Come on, Danny.

1315
01:32:06,216 --> 01:32:09,148
I came in here last night and
I put a bomb underneath the beam.

1316
01:32:09,216 --> 01:32:12,614
It'll go off at 7:30. You have five minutes
to get everyone out of here.

1317
01:32:12,684 --> 01:32:14,775
- What did he say?
- There's a bomb, go!

1318
01:32:14,850 --> 01:32:16,611
A bomb?

1319
01:32:19,483 --> 01:32:22,176
- Oh my God.
- We need to get out of the room!

1320
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:24,045
David, get your wife
out of here. Go!

1321
01:32:24,116 --> 01:32:26,742
We have an emergency.
Everybody needs to exit the building.

1322
01:32:28,283 --> 01:32:30,442
Avi, get everybody out.
Everybody go, hurry!

1323
01:32:30,517 --> 01:32:31,710
Outside on the wall.

1324
01:32:34,717 --> 01:32:37,581
- Mother, watch your step.
- Out the door!

1325
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:40,514
Danny, come on! Danny!

1326
01:32:42,116 --> 01:32:43,605
Danny!

1327
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:50,273
- Let's go!
- What about Danny?

1328
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:52,873
- He's not coming.
- What do you mean he's not coming?

1329
01:32:56,850 --> 01:32:59,940
<i>If you had come out of Egypt,
you would have been destroyed</i>

1330
01:33:00,016 --> 01:33:02,914
<i>in the desert with all those
who worshipped the golden calf.</i>

1331
01:33:02,983 --> 01:33:05,006
Then let Him destroy me now.

1332
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:07,675
Go ahead. Kill me.

1333
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:10,011
Here I am.

1334
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:11,777
Do it.

1335
01:33:48,717 --> 01:33:50,376
Danny.

1336
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:52,575
Glad you came back.

1337
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:55,013
I wanted to take up
that discussion we were having.

1338
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:59,549
- I can't right now.
- About Abraham and Isaac.

1339
01:33:59,617 --> 01:34:01,674
You remember what you said?

1340
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:03,874
That Isaac actually died
on Mount Moriah.

1341
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:07,541
I've been thinking maybe
you were right about that.

1342
01:34:07,617 --> 01:34:12,549
You remember what you said?
That Isaac actually died on Mount Moriah.

1343
01:34:12,617 --> 01:34:15,208
I've been thinking,
maybe you were right about that.

1344
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:20,181
Died... and then reborn
in the world to come.

1345
01:34:22,116 --> 01:34:23,911
You remember what you said?

1346
01:34:23,983 --> 01:34:27,313
That Isaac actually died
on Mount Moriah.

1347
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:31,042
I've been thinking maybe
you were right about that.

1348
01:34:31,116 --> 01:34:35,173
Died... and then reborn
in the world to come.

1349
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,977
Danny, stop.

1350
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:39,812
Where do you think you're going?

1351
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:41,872
Don't you know?

1352
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,409
There's nothing up there.

1353
01:36:21,316 --> 01:36:24,282
<i>"... your only son whom you love, Isaac,</i>

1354
01:36:24,350 --> 01:36:26,612
<i>and go unto the land of Moriah</i>

1355
01:36:26,684 --> 01:36:29,275
<i>and offer him there as a sacrifice</i>

1356
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,815
<i>on a mountain that I will show you."</i>

1357
01:36:31,883 --> 01:36:33,577
<i>So...</i>

1358
01:36:35,949 --> 01:36:37,847
<i>"I will show you."</i>

1359
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,348
<i>It was a test of Abraham's faith,</i>

1360
01:37:05,417 --> 01:37:07,712
<i>of his devotion to God.</i>

1361
01:37:09,983 --> 01:37:12,541
<i>It's not about Abraham's faith.</i>

1362
01:37:12,617 --> 01:37:15,242
<i>It's about God's power.</i>

1363
01:37:16,383 --> 01:37:18,848
<i>Abstraction.</i>

1364
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,711
<i>They're obsessed with abstraction.</i>

1365
01:37:21,783 --> 01:37:23,715
<i>"Kill your only son,</i>

1366
01:37:23,783 --> 01:37:26,215
<i>because I'm everything
and you're nothing."</i>

1367
01:37:27,417 --> 01:37:28,440
<i>"You're nothing."</i>

1368
01:37:39,883 --> 01:37:43,441
<i>Jews.</i>

1369
01:37:43,517 --> 01:37:46,244
<i>Judaism.</i>

1370
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:52,182
<i>They're still just Jews.</i>

1371
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:55,478
<i>Differences exist, of course.
All right?</i>

1372
01:37:55,550 --> 01:37:57,777
<i>But they're irrelevant,</i>

1373
01:37:57,849 --> 01:38:00,781
<i>'cause for a Jew,
his Jewishness dominates everything.</i>

1374
01:38:00,849 --> 01:38:03,872
<i>And even the ones who renounce it,</i>

1375
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:07,074
<i>and who hate its strength and want
to cut it out of their hearts...</i>
