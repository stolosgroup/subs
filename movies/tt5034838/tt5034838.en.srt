-Where's your clearance tag? -You know what?

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The fact that you're talking about

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
clearance tags right now in a time of crisis

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is incredibly unprofessional.

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We should be talking about evacuation.

194
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of the U.S. after last night's sudden Godzilla attack.

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A time of relative peace shattered

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
when the massive Titan,

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
once thought to be a hero to humanity,

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
made landfall in Pensacola, Florida.

199
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
While the damage was largely contained

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to the U.S. headquarters of Apex Cybernetics,

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
governments around the world aren't taking any chances

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
after the first substantiated Titan sighting

203
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
in over three years.

204
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
CEO Walter Simmons had this to say.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's about working together to ensure a safer world.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Godzilla's a threat to humanity,

207
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and Apex has a plan to deal with it,

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
-once and for all. -[school bell rings]

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
[woman on PA] Students and faculty,

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
please be advised

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a mandatory assembly will be held

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Guidance counselors will also be holding

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
additional office hours all this week

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
for individual and group sessions.

[Bernie on speaker] Welcome back, loyal listeners,

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to  Titan Truth Podcast, episode 246.

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, my God. I was there.

219
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Godzilla's Apex attack. I saw it go down!

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You think it's a coincidence that he reappears

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
and just so happens to destroy that specific facility?

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Ha-ha, no, no, no, no. No such thing as coincidence.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
[Madison] Dad, I'm telling you,

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
there's something

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
provoking him that we're not seeing here.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why else would Godzilla flash an intimidation display

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
if there wasn't another Titan around?

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That podcast is filling your head with garbage.

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
-You should be in school. -I am just trying to help.

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't want you to help. I want you to stay safe.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We needed a plan to keep peace with these things,

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and the best one we had just went down in flames.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't have any more.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And the last thing that I need is to be worrying about you.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Godzilla saved us. You were there with Mom. You saw it.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How could you doubt him?

237
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
-There has to be a pattern. -There doesn't.

238
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
-A reason why he was provoked. -There isn't.

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How do you know that?

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because creatures, like people, can change.

241
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And right now, Godzilla's out there

242
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and he's hurting people, and we don't know why.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So cut your pop some slack, would ya?

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
See you at home, Dad.

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
[Bernie]  You wanna know my theory?

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I mean, of course you do. That's why you're here.

247
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Come on, it's all about patterns and variables.

248
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, wait, stick with me. I'm gonna take you back

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
to sixth grade with this, okay?

250
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Godzilla attacks when provoked, that's the pattern.

251
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Pensacola is the only coastal Apex hub

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
with an advanced robotics lab.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's the variable.

254
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And add them up and your answer is

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
that Apex is at the heart of the problem.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
-[faint beep] -[door closes]

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Can I help you?

258
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you want an appointment,

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
my office hours are nine to five.

260
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
-[Walter] Please, Dr. Lind. -What the f...

Guys like you and me,

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
we don't do normal hours, do we?

263
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've been fixated on Hollow Earth

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
for as long as you have.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Your theory that it's the birthplace of all Titans

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
is fascinating.

267
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Your book was very impressive.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, yeah? Well, I got about 30 unsold boxes

269
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
in my apartment if you want some.

270
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000

Walt Simmons.

272
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I know who you are, sir. It's an honor.

273
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No, the honor is mine. As is the urgency.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Godzilla has never attacked us unprovoked before.

275
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
These are dangerous times, Dr. Lind.

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Allow me to introduce

277
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
our Apex chief technology officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

278
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He has an interesting thing to show you.

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
[beeps]

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Magnetic imaging from one of our new satellites.

281
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know what this is, right?

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
[Nathan] Hollow Earth.

283
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
[Walter] An ecosystem as vast as any ocean,

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
right beneath our feet.

285
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This energy signal is enormous.

286
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And almost identical to readings from  Gojira.

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
[Walter] As our sun fuels the planet's surface,

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
this energy sustains the Hollow Earth,

289
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
enabling life as powerful as our aggressive Titan friend.

290
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If we can harness this life force,

291
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
we'll have a weapon that can compete with Godzilla.

292
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I need your help to find it.

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
[chuckling]

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't know if I'm the right guy for the job.

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you read the reviews?

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
"A sci-fi quack trading in fringe physics."

297
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Look where they put my office.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm in the basement right across from flute class.

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Besides, I'm not with Monarch anymore.

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And Hollow Earth entry is impossible.

301
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We tried.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry about your brother.

303
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He was a true pioneer.

304
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Thanks.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
[sniffles, clears throat]

306
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
See, all of our forward scans

307
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
suggest a habitable environment down there.

308
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So, what really went wrong on your brother's mission?

309
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
When they tried to enter,

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
they hit a gravitational inversion.

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
A whole planet's worth of gravity

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
reversed in a split second.

313
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They were crushed in an instant.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What if I told you that we, at Apex,

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
have created a phenomenal craft

316
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
which could sustain such an inversion?

317
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle.

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
HEAV.

319
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We can make the journey

320
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
to Hollow Earth possible, Dr. Lind.

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But we need you to lead the mission.

322
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Help me.

323
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Help everyone.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Finding this needle in a haystack

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is our best shot against Godzilla.

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, I, uh, might have an idea.

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
But it's crazy.

328
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I love crazy ideas. They made me rich.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
[Nathan] Are you guys familiar with genetic memory?

330
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a theory that all Titans share a common impulse

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
to return to their evolutionary source.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you think he would take directions from her?

No.

666
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
If we have someone who can keep the reins on Kong...

667
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, no one can keep the reins on Kong.

[Nathan] I know Jia is only a child.

00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But she's the only one he'll communicate with.

673
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And we need Kong to find that power source.

674
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000

No. We're nowhere near the areas you flagged.

685
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It looks like he's coming for us anyway.

686
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
[Ilene] He's not coming for us.

687
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Him? Then dump him. Dump the monkey!

688

If we lose Kong, the mission is over.

692

He's a sitting duck out there.

693
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
We have to let him protect himself. And us.

So, what's the plan?

Yeah, why?
