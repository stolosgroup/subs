00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN
from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

2
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,875
- Well, I expect it'll cloud over later on.
- Aye.

3
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,250
What's going on at Sutton Hoo, then?

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,416
There's a lady
who's got an excavating job.

5
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:52,125
- Ah, thank you kindly. Mind how you go.
- Thank you.

6
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:42,166
Mornin'. Mrs. Pretty, please.

7
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:44,250
Basil Brown.

8
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,083
Wait here.

9
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,791
- Should we take a look at them, then?
- Right.

10
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:16,500
Things like this
are usually done through museums.

11
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:20,333
Yes.
But when I approached Ipswich,

12
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,208
Mr. Reid Moir said
that, with the war coming,

13
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:24,291
they couldn't embark upon
any new ventures.

14
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:27,458
Well, they have their hands full
with a Roman villa.

15
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,208
- Yes. He said you were working on it.
- I am.

16
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,416
He told me you were a difficult man.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,791
Did he, now?

18
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:38,000
Unorthodox… and untrained.

19
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,125
So that's his reference, is it?

20
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:42,875
Well, I'm… I'm not untrained.

21
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,083
I've been on dig
since I was old enough to hold a trowel.

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,375
My father taught me.

23
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,458
Perhaps Reid Moir
just wants to keep you for himself.

24
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,916
I don't know about that.

25
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,208
I've always had a curiosity
to see these here mounds.

26
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,750
- Henry VIII came here to dig.
- So I'm told.

27
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,208
Well, no record of what he found.

28
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,125
My husband and I bought this land,

29
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,041
with the hope of exploring
what was under there.

30
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:13,708
But… Well, best-laid plans.

31
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,791
What are they?
Would you hazard a guess?

32
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,291
Burial mounds, I expect.

33
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,458
We're standing
in someone's graveyard, I reckon.

34
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:25,708
Viking…

35
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,208
Or maybe older.

36
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,666
Apparently, local girls used to lie down
on them in the hope of falling pregnant.

37
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,083
I've heard plenty of legends.

38
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,208
Is that why you want to dig, Mrs. Pretty?

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,958
Tales of buried treasure?

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,000
My interest
in archaeology began like yours,

41
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,250
when I was scarcely old enough
to hold a trowel.

42
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:53,833
My childhood home
was built on a Cistercian convent.

43
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,791
I helped my father excavate the apse.

44
00:03:58,458 --> 00:03:59,916
That speaks, don't it?

45
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:02,541
The past.

46
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,458
You have rabbits, Mrs. Pretty.

47
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,958
Yes, I am aware of that.

48
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,500
Rabbits burrow.

49
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,250
They're bad for excavations.

50
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,375
I'd like to start with this one.

51
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,625
Ah, I wouldn't start
with this one, Mrs. Pretty,

52
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,250
not personally speaking.

53
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,083
- Why not?
- 'Cause that dips in the middle, see?

54
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,041
And the soil feels... That's compacted.

55
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,000
Thieves used to sink shafts in.

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,416
Robber's flutes, they're called.

57
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,166
Anything they found
would've been melted down

58
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,708
and sold long ago.

59
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,458
I expect you might be better off with…

60
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,166
One of these.

61
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,458
But I have a feeling about this one.

62
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:47,250
Well, that's your money, Mrs. Pretty,

63
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,958
but I'd base your dig on evidence,

64
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,625
not feeling.

65
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,583
<i> As for money,</i>
<i>would 1 pound, 15 shillings,</i>

66
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,333
<i>and 6 pence a week be acceptable?</i>

67
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:03,875
- No.
- I asked Reid Moir what he pays.

68
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:06,291
- That was his reply.
- Well, he don't pay enough.

69
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,166
All right.

70
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,541
I'm afraid that's all
I can reasonably afford to spend.

71
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,500
Right, then. Understood.

72
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:16,583
Robert, where did you get that gas mask?
Take it off.

73
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,833
- Sorry, I didn't realize you were...
- This is not a toy.

74
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,375
Robert, this is Mr. Brown.

75
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:25,333
- Hello there, young man.
- Robert Pretty. How do you do?

76
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:26,333
Who's coming after you?

77
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,250
- Captain Laska and his gangsters.
- Oh!

78
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,083
- Mr. Brown is an archaeologist.
- Well, I'm an excavator.

79
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,625
- You've come to dig up the mounds?
- Well…

80
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,541
I'm afraid not. Uh, not today.

81
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:41,500
Excuse me.

82
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:48,208
- Good luck with your gangsters, Robert.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,750
And you, with your dig, ma'am.

84
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,208
Ah, blast.

85
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,541
- Mr. Brown?
- Yes?

86
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,666
Billy Lyons. Uh, uh, from Mrs. Pretty.

87
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,541
All right.

88
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,000
Tell her Monday, 8:00 sharp.

89
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,333
<i> I won't work</i>
<i>for less than two pound a week.</i>

90
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,125
<i>And it's too far to bike,
if you want a day's digging.</i>

91
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,916
<i>You could lodge with the Lyonses</i>
<i>in the coach house.</i>

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,333
<i>Mr. Lyons is my chauffeur,</i>

93
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,416
<i>and Mrs. Lyons
is in charge of the kitchen.</i>

94
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:05,583
- <i>Well, I'll need help.</i>
<i>- I could let you have one man.</i>

95
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:08,291
<i>Two would be better.</i>

96
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,041
<i>I'm glad we could come</i>
<i>to an arrangement after all, Mr. Brown.</i>

97
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,666
John Jacobs and Mr. Spooner
are bringing the shepherd's hut.

98
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,958
I thought it might be useful
in case of inclement weather.

99
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,958
Oh, that's very considerate.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,791
My son Robert
is keen to assist you in any way.

101
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,916
If you find his presence irksome...

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,583
Oh, no, no, no. He can come.

103
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,916
You'll start with this one?

104
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,791
Yeah.

105
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,291
I reckon we can forget
that larger mound, Mrs. Pretty.

106
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,083
This one here,
that's where we'll find something.

107
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,750
Well, shan't hold you up.

108
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,625
Thank you kindly.

109
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:05,958
If you ask me, the man should leave
Mrs. Pretty's mounds well alone.

110
00:08:57,791 --> 00:09:00,250
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Great, dear. Thank you.

111
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,958
Darling, please be gentle.
You'll knock me down.

112
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,375
I'm sorry. Mr. Brown says to come.

113
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,583
- Now?
- Yes.

114
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,958
Well, thank you for the message.

115
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,666
Well, it looks like the kind of tray
you get at a butcher's.

116
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,166
And there's some blackness here,
maybe indicating a fire was made.

117
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,458
Who are those men?

118
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,208
They're from the Ipswich Museum.
Mr. Reid Moir telephoned me.

119
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,083
He wanted to see how things
were progressing, so I invited him.

120
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:32,208
Mrs. Pretty,
this is Guy Maynard, our new curator.

121
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,666
- How do you do?
- Hello.

122
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,583
Hello, Brown.

123
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:38,000
Maynard. Can I borrow you,
please, for this here corner?

124
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,500
Jolly good.

125
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,333
One.

126
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,500
- You have it? Two.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Three! Blast.

128
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,333
Is that the sum of your labors?

129
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:53,833
Excuse me.

130
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,041
<i>I must urge you, Mrs. Pretty,</i>
<i>to support our Roman villa.</i>

131
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,291
War is looming.

132
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,083
All hands are on deck
to excavate before hostilities begin.

133
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,125
And so,
we must ask you to return Mr. Brown.

134
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,333
I'd like him to finish what he's started.

135
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,083
We may have found
the largest Roman villa

136
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,166
north of Felixstowe.

137
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,458
It's of far greater import,
if… if you'll forgive me, than this…

138
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,083
Minor venture.

139
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,166
- Then the choice is Mr. Brown's.
- Excuse me.

140
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,416
Time had altered that piece of wood

141
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,833
to compacted sand.

142
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,583
I didn't guess its age correctly.

143
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:56,166
I speculated Viking,
but I think that's older.

144
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,583
- Anglo-Saxon.
- That's most unlikely, Brown.

145
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:03,458
We should... We need you back at the villa.
That's what I'm here to say, and…

146
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,875
And Mrs. Pretty has released you.

147
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,833
I have said it is your choice.

148
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,958
Well, then I'll stay.

149
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,250
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

150
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:17,625
Excuse me.

151
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:19,250
Now, look here, Brown.

152
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,583
You've made your point.
You can have two pounds a week.

153
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,375
We'll give you a few days
to finish off here,

154
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,708
and then,
as we're the only museum in the area,

155
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,500
I'd carefully consider
where your future lies.

156
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:32,875
Understood.

157
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,375
<i>Mr. Brown's been telling us</i>
<i>all sorts of things.</i>

158
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,833
For instance,
what's the most important part

159
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,375
of an archaeologist's body?

160
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,208
I don't know.

161
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,250
His nose.

162
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,833
If there's something there,
he'll know it by the smell.

163
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,208
You're going to see your father
this afternoon?

164
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,500
I… I'm afraid I'm needed here.

165
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,416
- Um, please, may I get down?
- If you're quite sure you've finished.

166
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,541
<i>Boiled beef</i>…

167
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,125
On a hot day like this is unlikely
to agree with anyone, Mrs. Lyons.

168
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:45,208
It was exactly like last time.

169
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,916
Mrs. Pretty, you produce
all this acid because you're a worrier.

170
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,625
We've spoken on this subject before.

171
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,708
You must learn to stop worrying.

172
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,458
Otherwise, you'll give yourself an ulcer.

173
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,583
- Well… if that's what you think.
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:24,541
Oh, you don't wanna be down there,
Mrs. Pretty. That ain't safe.

175
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,083
Spooner and John Jacobs
are making supports.

176
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,375
We can't continue without them now.

177
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,416
I was reading Howard Carter's account

178
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
of his excavation
of the tomb of Tutankhamun.

179
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,625
He stood at the threshold
of the burial chamber,

180
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,125
the first man to do so for 3,000 years,

181
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,375
and he saw finger marks
still on the paint.

182
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,666
He say, "Time lost its meaning."

183
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,500
It occurs to me
that you might unearth human remains.

184
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,833
Yeah, that's possible.

185
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,333
We're digging down to meet the dead.

186
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,250
Disinterring them, in fact.

187
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,416
There's always coroner's inquests
when remains are found.

188
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:17,750
The dead still get that courtesy,
no matter how many centuries they've lain.

189
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,958
We can't dig down into the earth
without considering that...

190
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,166
Brown?

191
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,875
Mr. Brown?

192
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,416
Spooner! Jacob! Get help!

193
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,250
There! There! There!

194
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:32,875
Come on, Basil!

195
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,708
Careful with his head.

196
00:18:32,708 --> 00:18:34,958
Mr. Brown! Mr. Brown!

197
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,291
Mr. Brown!

198
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,791
Mr. Brown?

199
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,750
- That's it.
- That's it.

200
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,708
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown.

201
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,958
You're all right now.
You're all right. You're all right.

202
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,416
You're all right.

203
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,250
Into the library, Grateley.
Lay him on the sofa.

204
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,583
<i>Did you see something?</i>

205
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:39,833
<i>See something?</i>

206
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,166
When you were gone.

207
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,000
Something did come into my head.

208
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:49,875
What was it?

209
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,958
My, uh… my grandfather.

210
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,000
I have his name.

211
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,416
Basil Brown.

212
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,083
Farming man.

213
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,583
Taught me everything I know
about Suffolk soil.

214
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,166
And you saw him?

215
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,791
Oh, I saw nothing at all.
I was just…

216
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,875
I just thought of him.

217
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,916
Well… perhaps he saw you.

218
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,250
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Brown, are you all right?

219
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,333
<i>Mr. Brown!</i>

220
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,916
Mr. Brown, you have to rest!

221
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,375
See, Mrs. Pretty…
this one is the one you like.

222
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:35,416
It's the one you wanted me to start on.
It's oval.

223
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,375
Like a hog's back.

224
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:44,541
- See? All the others, circular.
- Yes.

225
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,083
Now,
this land's been plowed for 1,000 year.

226
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:51,458
Now, supposing whoever plowed here…

227
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,166
Gradually knocked a bit off.

228
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,125
So, by the time robbers come along,

229
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:59,625
they'd have sunk the flute
into what they thought was the center.

230
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,041
- But it might not have been.
- That's right.

231
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,250
East to west, that's my feeling.

232
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,208
You say the word…

233
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,333
…and I'll dig.

234
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:45,125
My plane crashed
into the Arctic waste, you see.

235
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:49,375
And when I woke up, 500 years had passed.

236
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,250
- So, now I'm stuck in the 25th century.
- What's that like, then?

237
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,541
Well,
the Earth is controlled by Killer Kane,

238
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,083
who's an extremely evil man.

239
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,250
Like Hitler?

240
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:01,083
Yes, with an even worse mustache.

241
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,000
Did the people

242
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,583
who made these burial mounds
have mustaches?

243
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,791
And beards.

244
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,458
They were a very beardy lot.

245
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:12,083
Not like them there Romans.
Now, they liked the close shave.

246
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:15,958
The Vikings and the space pilots
are the same, really, aren't they?

247
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:19,791
They explore new lands
and have battles in ships.

248
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:25,250
Yeah, when you put it like that,
I suppose they might be the same.

249
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:31,000
They come over all the time.
There's an RAF base nearby.

250
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:37,708
Would you like to fly, Mr. Brown?

251
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,041
Oh, but I do.

252
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:43,833
All over the cosmos,
every time I look through my telescope.

253
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,958
You… You have a telescope?

254
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,375
- I do.
- Did you bring it with you?

255
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,625
I did.

256
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,375
Well, will you show me?

257
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:53,500
I might.

258
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,583
Cor! He likes to natter, he does.

259
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,916
What was all that about space travel?

260
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:08,333
<i>Mr. Brown had an awful lot of books.</i>

261
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,333
<i>Came on his bike
with a great parcel of them.</i>

262
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,875
<i>Sloan says some are in Norwegian.</i>

263
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,916
<i>Shall we try the green silk?</i>

264
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:18,666
<i>- It's an old favorite, isn't it?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

265
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,708
The velvet with the lace.

266
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,666
Mrs. Lyons hopes it will agree.

267
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,125
How's your leg, Mr. Grateley?

268
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,208
Oh, much better, ma'am.
Thank you for inquiring.

269
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,875
Would you like the wireless?

270
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,666
Yes, please.

271
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,291
<i>…the Air Guard</i>
<i>under the age of 32</i>

272
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,041
<i>are now being asked to stand by</i>

273
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,125
<i>for further training
as RAF pilots or crew.</i>

274
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:09,166
<i>She's only been here 12 year.</i>

275
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,083
Came down from Cheshire.

276
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,875
Then she married the colonel.

277
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:19,333
He first met with Edith
when she was still at school.

278
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,916
And on his 17th birthday,
he asked her to marry him.

279
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:25,458
- She turned him down.
- Mm.

280
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:28,333
She say
she can't possibly leave her father.

281
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:36,541
She cared for her father
another 13 year, until he died.

282
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,875
<i>After 13 years.</i>

283
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:42,000
<i>She finally accepted</i>
<i>the colonel's proposal.</i>

284
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,916
<i>He been asking every year on her birthday.</i>

285
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,125
<i>On her birthday.</i>

286
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,250
<i>Just after they had Robert…</i>

287
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,958
<i>Her husband went and died too.</i>

288
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,541
<i>Imagine that.</i>

289
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,250
Do any of you want to look through this?

290
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,125
- I thought we'd sit down on that.
- You have a go.

291
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:14,791
That's right.

292
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,041
I'm gonna follow you back home.

293
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,958
Wait! Wait, for Christ's sake!

294
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:30,166
Come on.

295
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,916
<i>Maynard! Maynard!</i>

296
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,916
They found an iron rivet
at the burial mound at Snape, didn't they?

297
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,208
Snape?
Basil, what have you found?

298
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,750
My goodness, Basil.

299
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:04,041
- Right. Any joy, Basil?
- Coming along together.

300
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,500
Mr. Spooner, will you bring
my tape measure from the hut?

301
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,666
One of you best get Mrs. Pretty down here.

302
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,375
- She's gone up to London.
- She what? How long?

303
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:16,041
London, with Robert.
Couple of days.

304
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:17,958
Blast.

305
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:22,083
Right, boys. Here we go. Come on together.

306
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,541
Better have something to show
Mrs. Pretty when she get back.

307
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,416
And the crystal glasses!

308
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,208
No, no, no. Side door, please.

309
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:34,416
- Mrs. Pretty back from London yet?
- Mrs. Pretty's about to dine.

310
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,833
I told you it was urgent.

311
00:26:35,916 --> 00:26:38,833
Mr. Brown, I'm sure
you wouldn't like to interfere with...

312
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,583
It's all right, Mr. Grateley.

313
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,041
- Is it Mr. Brown?
- Yes, darling. Darling

314
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,541
I think you'd better come and see.

315
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,416
That's a ship.

316
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,041
How do you mean, a ship?

317
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,916
Oh, well, that's a ship
that's been buried in the mound.

318
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,375
Why would anyone want to bury a ship?

319
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,083
Well,
I expect because that's a grave.

320
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,375
Whose grave?

321
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:27,041
Well, I'd expect
this is a grave of a… a great man.

322
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28,791
A warrior…

323
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:31,208
Or a king.

324
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:37,125
They must have pulled his ship all the way
up that there hill from the river.

325
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:42,208
Now, they'd have put it on ropes,
and they'd have hauled it over logs.

326
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:47,083
Men, horses. It must have taken
hundreds of 'em.

327
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,500
I don't expect them to go
to all this trouble for any little squirt.

328
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:54,208
Can you imagine
the send-off they'd be giving him?

329
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:57,500
The songs they'd be singing.

330
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,958
They'd have drunk Mr. Spooner
under the table.

331
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:01,833
Vikings?

332
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:04,375
Well, I… I think that's older.

333
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,791
Maynard disagrees,
but I think it's Anglo-Saxon.

334
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:12,250
Now, this is your doing, John Jacobs,
'cause you found the first rivet.

335
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:15,041
That's right, Mrs. Pretty. He did.

336
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:18,791
Congratulations, Mr. Brown.

337
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,666
Well, you thought
there was something, didn't you?

338
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,250
I had my feeling.

339
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,750
That you did, Mrs. Pretty. That you did.

340
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,208
Oh, John.

341
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,583
- Congratulations, Mr. Spooner.
- Thank you, ma'am.

342
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,625
We couldn't have done it
without this young man here.

343
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,625
Psst.

344
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,791
Robert, a ship!

345
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,416
<i>Thank you. Mr. Brown.</i>

346
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,916
<i>Well,</i>
<i>there's a lot of earth to</i>…<i> to shift now.</i>

347
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,250
<i>But who knows?</i>

348
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:51,791
<i>I'm pretty sure it continues further.</i>

349
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,083
Evening.

350
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,666
Evening.

351
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,666
Do you realize what this means?

352
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:41,125
It's going to change everything
for Ipswich.

353
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,333
We'll be the envy
of every museum in the country.

354
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,583
- You're gonna get wet, Mrs. Pretty.
- I'm afraid I already am.

355
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:57,541
Mr. Reid Moir has kindly offered
to take charge of the dig.

356
00:29:59,583 --> 00:30:01,750
I turned his generous offer down.

357
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:04,083
- You didn't.
- I did.

358
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,583
What did he say?

359
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,375
He said I couldn't keep it to myself,
which is true.

360
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:12,708
I bet he blew his gasket.

361
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:15,791
In the meantime, I've asked my cousin,
Rory Lomax, to come.

362
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,833
- Right.
- I can see you need another pair of hands.

363
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:21,541
He's only an amateur,
but then, so is Mr. Reid Moir.

364
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,583
- Mrs. Pretty, you better go in the shed.
- Oh, yes.

365
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,208
- You're gonna get very wet here.
- I will.

366
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:47,916
<i>I wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for your patience with Robert.</i>

367
00:30:48,416 --> 00:30:50,333
<i>He can hardly wait to see you
in the mornings.</i>

368
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,916
<i>Well, keeps me on me toes,</i>
<i>having him around.</i>

369
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,625
Do you have children?

370
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,916
No, uh, we, uh…

371
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,708
No.

372
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,583
The servants tell me
you've studied everything,

373
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,208
from Latin to geology.

374
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:16,833
Well, a little education
is a dangerous thing.

375
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,916
Apparently, you've written a book.

376
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,041
I have.

377
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,708
A guide to astronomical maps and charts,

378
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:27,500
to make them accessible to ordinary men.

379
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,750
<i> I left school when I was 12.</i>

380
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,750
<i>Always had a hunger to study.</i>

381
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,541
<i>I got a place</i>
<i>at London University.</i>

382
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,458
<i>My father wouldn't hear of it.</i>

383
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,291
Would you have dinner with me?

384
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,583
Well… thank you. Yes.

385
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,166
Evening, Vera.

386
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,875
Surprise for you, Basil, in your room.

387
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:32,708
Right.

388
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,958
May.

389
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,625
I brought you some fresh shirts.

390
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:47,333
About time, I say.

391
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,208
- Are you pleased to see me?
- Of course I am.

392
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,666
- You didn't know I was coming, did you?
- No. No, I didn't.

393
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,583
I did tell you.

394
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,000
In my last letter.

395
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:07,250
I was saving them for the weekend.

396
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:10,083
I've been working every hour.
You know what I'm like.

397
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:12,750
Yes… I do.

398
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,666
I'm very busy.

399
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,291
- It looks like it. Nowhere to sit in here.
- There's a lot going on here.

400
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,708
- What's that?
- I said there's nowhere to sit down.

401
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,166
Yeah. Sorry about that.
It's all... So much going on.

402
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,166
You got something to show me?
I think you have.

403
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,708
I can see it in your eyes.

404
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,208
I'm not saying anything.

405
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:35,458
There's Mr. Brown with a woman.

406
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:41,416
I suppose it's his wife.
You know, she writes to him every day.

407
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:46,916
Come in.

408
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:53,291
Mr. Brown sends his apologies, ma'am.

409
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:01,375
That's all. Thank you, Ellen.

410
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,458
<i>A man could dig the earth</i>
<i>his whole life through</i>

411
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,375
<i>and not find anything
like I've discovered here.</i>

412
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:12,666
- <i>She's beautiful, all right.</i>
<i>- Yeah, she's beautiful.</i>

413
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,541
<i>You'll have to watch your back</i>
<i>with a thing like this.</i>

414
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,625
<i>What do you mean?</i>

415
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:19,916
<i>Everyone's gonna want a piece</i>
<i>of this here ship, and this is your find.</i>

416
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,833
<i>Oh, May…</i>

417
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:23,291
<i>Don't let Ipswich Museum</i>
<i>take your glory.</i>

418
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,833
- <i>He's not gonna take...</i>
<i>- Or that lady at the manor.</i>

419
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:28,416
<i>- She should be upping your wages again.</i>
<i>- She's supportive.</i>

420
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,541
- <i>You asked?</i>
<i>- I ain't gonna ask for more.</i>

421
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,958
Well, she's very, very gracious,
Mrs. Pretty.

422
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:36,125
Your heart's lost
to this Viking maiden, I can tell.

423
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,125
Innit?

424
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:42,291
<i>Ah, May, you sure you don't want</i>
<i>to stay the night?</i>

425
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,916
I'll miss my lift back.

426
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,583
Right, yeah, um…

427
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,916
Well, thanks for coming, May.

428
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,958
I do miss you.

429
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,583
- I've been reading your books for company.
- You haven't.

430
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,750
I have.

431
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:03,041
Hell,
it's not much company, is it?

432
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:06,000
- No, they're hard work, I tell you.
- They are.

433
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,083
Right. Well,
it's good of you to bring my shirts.

434
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,583
Yeah.

435
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,541
All right.

436
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,500
I'll read them letters tonight.

437
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,791
- Bye, then.
- Bye.

438
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,708
Blast!

439
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,250
- Let me help.
- Right.

440
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,916
Right, then.
Get around that side and take this tarp.

441
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,791
That's… That's right. That's right.
There's a stake there behind you.

442
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,750
Pull it hard.

443
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,208
<i>Where in God's name</i>
<i>did you come from?</i>

444
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,708
<i>I rode, actually,</i>

445
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,083
<i>on my motorbike from Ipswich.</i>

446
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,625
<i>I'm Rory Lomax.</i>

447
00:36:29,708 --> 00:36:32,333
<i>Aye. Did Reid Moir send you?</i>

448
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,458
From the museum?

449
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,416
I'm Edith Pretty's cousin.

450
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,166
She telephoned, asked me to come.

451
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,625
- Said you needed an extra pair of hands.
- All right.

452
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:45,583
I pointed out my general lack of skill,
but she was undeterred.

453
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:47,583
Right. Well…

454
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:51,666
<i>No doubt you'll hear
that my name is Brown. Basil Brown.</i>

455
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,750
<i>Good to meet you.</i>

456
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:55,041
<i> Now,</i>
<i>it's gonna be raining for a while,</i>

457
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:57,375
<i>so go on and take a seat.</i>

458
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:00,666
<i>I expect you'd, uh, be wet,
coming from Ipswich on a motorbike.</i>

459
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,416
- <i>I was, rather.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

460
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,708
- <i>Just caught me at the end.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

461
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:07,625
<i>Well, I'll light the stove.
Would you like some tea?</i>

462
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,083
<i>Yes, please.</i>

463
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:12,875
<i>I think we may have found, um,</i>
<i>an old, uh, Anglo-Saxon ship.</i>

464
00:37:13,625 --> 00:37:16,666
<i>When this rain clears tomorrow,
maybe you can see what we're doing.</i>

465
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,833
- Yeah?
- How very exciting.

466
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,750
Yeah, it's all right.

467
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:31,208
- Not gonna cover it.
- Get the second tarp.

468
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,000
- Pass me the hammer, please.
- Right.

469
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,625
All right, then.

470
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,708
Lift up.

471
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,958
That's right.

472
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:46,125
Rory!

473
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,208
Hello, Spud.

474
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,333
Arrived in the night.
Didn't want to wake you.

475
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,333
Where's your mother?

476
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,541
<i>Oh, she's gone to London.</i>

477
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,166
Who knows
if we'll still be alive in a year?

478
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:23,250
The yellow and green balls denote gas.

479
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,125
Red denotes high explosives.

480
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:29,166
Red stripes are incendiary bombs.

481
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,708
If you are caught on the streets
during an air raid,

482
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:37,333
you must know the appropriate response
to each form of attack.

483
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,708
No, don't throw them about!

484
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,958
<i>I was rushing</i>
<i>to get here on time.</i>

485
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,416
<i>Might that have affected the results?</i>

486
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:12,333
Possibly, but the,
uh, underlying condition is there.

487
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,750
The pneumatic fever
you had as a child, it, uh,

488
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,833
damaged the valves of your heart.

489
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,875
Irreparably, I'm afraid.

490
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,958
Another attack
is likely to be much… more serious.

491
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,666
Possibly even fatal.

492
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,791
- Is there nothing else that can be done?
- I'm sorry. I… I…

493
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,375
I wish I had better news.

494
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,958
Mr. Reid Moir is here, ma'am,
with some other gentlemen.

495
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,791
They wouldn't stop to give me their names.

496
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,625
Then they're trespassing. Where are they?

497
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:09,708
- On their way to the mounds.
- Fetch them, quickly.

498
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:12,166
- Right.
- Lyons?

499
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,500
Now, I've been reading up
about the Oseberg Ship.

500
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,375
That's a Viking ship they found in Norway.

501
00:41:24,875 --> 00:41:28,583
There was a burial chamber
in the center, roofed.

502
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,250
It's a bit like we imagine Noah's Ark.

503
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,833
Course, any roof here
would have caved in long ago.

504
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:37,750
See, this line here.

505
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:41,416
The ground is higher,
but this soil is darker.

506
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,500
So you think there's something beneath?

507
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,791
Well, we may know by the end of today.

508
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,416
Ye gods!

509
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,625
This is incredible!

510
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:56,333
We at the Ipswich Museum
pride ourselves on our work,

511
00:41:56,416 --> 00:42:00,041
and I… I think you'll agree
that it's rock solid.

512
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:03,458
- You… You need to stop there.
- I beg your pardon?

513
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:05,791
This is a very delicate site,
and it ain't safe.

514
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:07,708
Uh, not for a man of your size.

515
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:11,166
Is this your work?

516
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,625
Uh, yes. I'm Basil Brown, excavator.

517
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:20,375
Well, Basil Brown, excavator…

518
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,083
I am Charles Phillips, archaeologist,

519
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:27,416
and I'm here to tell you that,

520
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,458
as this is a find of national interest,

521
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:33,791
the British Museum will be taking charge.

522
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:35,458
Your work…

523
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,541
looks, thankfully, decent,

524
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,791
but your excavating service
is no longer required.

525
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:47,166
Am… Am I to understand
that you will be personally taking over?

526
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:50,791
Grimes,
I have never seen anything like it.

527
00:42:50,875 --> 00:42:52,666
- Quite, sir.
- Brailesford.

528
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,416
- Sir.
- Cancel everything I've got.

529
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,458
Find out who's free. We need Piggott.

530
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,208
- Find us lodgings, as near as you can.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,583
That dark soil in the middle,
C.W., looks very promising.

532
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,250
You men, finish up,
and don't move another pebble!

533
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,708
Excuse me, Mr. Phillips.

534
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm not employed by you.

535
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,125
I'm employed by Mrs. Pretty,

536
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:18,083
and I'll keep on working
until she tells me different.

537
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:23,166
An ad hoc team from a provincial museum
cannot be left in charge.

538
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:26,250
Mrs. Pretty must see that.

539
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,541
John, a minute is all I need.
I… I know she'll want to hear this.

540
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:37,958
- All right, all right. Wait here.
- Right.

541
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,500
She'll see you tomorrow morning
at 10:30.

542
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,375
She must know what I found.

543
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:50,708
- Don't push it, old boy!
- She must know!

544
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:51,791
John!

545
00:43:56,416 --> 00:44:00,000
- Is he gone, Mr. Grateley?
- It's not Grateley.

546
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:04,875
I… I'm sorry for disturbing you,
but I believe…

547
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,625
We may have found
a burial chamber in the ship.

548
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:14,041
- Does Mr. Phillips know?
- I don't work for Mr. Phillips.

549
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,458
What are your wishes?

550
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:25,041
I, uh… He just informed me that,
by order of the Ministry of Works,

551
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,250
the site must be placed under his control.

552
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,083
Well, uh…

553
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:35,916
…that's that, then.

554
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,208
Well, I…
I can carry on for one more day…

555
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:41,875
If that's what you'd like.

556
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:48,458
Are… Are you poorly, Mrs. Pretty?

557
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,500
Um…

558
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:54,791
Perhaps you might, um…

559
00:44:55,791 --> 00:44:57,208
Might ring the bell for me.

560
00:44:57,958 --> 00:44:58,791
Right.

561
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,083
He's got no right to dictate to you.

562
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,750
This ship's only appearing because of you.

563
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,708
Don't forget why you wanted it begun.

564
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,958
Now, you said that was a feeling.

565
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,875
Your feeling is right.

566
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:20,875
- Mr. Brown seems to have found his way in.
- Mr. Brown.

567
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:27,625
All right.

568
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,416
Is there anything
I could bring you?

569
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,958
Fetch Ellen for me, please.

570
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,750
<i>Mrs. Pretty is keen to keep you on,</i>

571
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,916
<i>so we'll make good use of you.</i>

572
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,166
<i>Your primary task
will be to keep the site in order.</i>

573
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:15,750
<i>So, I want the tumulus dug back
to an area of four feet on either side,</i>

574
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,708
and I want those spoil heaps removed.

575
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,083
From now on,

576
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:24,708
you're not to set foot in the body
of the ship without my express permission.

577
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:25,791
Carry on.

578
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,750
Are you gonna put up with that, Basil?

579
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:48,750
Hello, Mr. Brown.

580
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,208
- My mother's got her heartburn.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

581
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:56,083
She has to have peace and quiet.
I made her this.

582
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,958
- Well, that's a very fine rocket.
- Where are you going?

583
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,250
Oh, I… Oh, I have to go home now.

584
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:04,375
When will you be back?

585
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,166
Well, uh… I'm sorry, Robert. I…

586
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,333
I am.

587
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:16,041
Uh, but, Mr. Brown…

588
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,791
Mr. Brown!

589
00:48:19,375 --> 00:48:22,416
- Mr. Brown!
<i>- It seems I'm out of a job.</i>

590
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,833
Phillips won't let us in his ship.

591
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,125
<i>His</i> ship? Really?

592
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,500
I thought I might take some photographs.
It could make a useful record.

593
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,416
- Would you mind?
- Not at all.

594
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,041
As long as they're not of me.

595
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,750
Can't say I blame Brown.

596
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,125
Such a decent man
doesn't deserve Phillips.

597
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,458
Blame him?

598
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,208
Well, he left this morning.
Didn't you know?

599
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:47,875
Where's Robert?

600
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,750
You don't have another job?

601
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,416
I'll write to Maynard,
and he'll give me something.

602
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,666
Did you tell Mrs. Pretty you were leaving?

603
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,375
I thought I'd let her work it out herself.

604
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:23,625
And that's the thanks she gets

605
00:49:23,708 --> 00:49:25,708
for giving you the opportunity
in the first place?

606
00:49:25,791 --> 00:49:28,708
Mark my words, May,
I won't receive any credit.

607
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,416
- I won't even be a footnote.
- Is that why you took the job?

608
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,833
- For credit?
- How can I stay on?

609
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,416
Is that why you've been digging
your whole life for barely enough

610
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,416
to cover our rent?

611
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,708
No, May. I do it 'cause I'm good at it.

612
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,750
'Cause that's what my father taught me,
and what his father taught him.

613
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:46,000
'Cause you can show me a handful of soil
from anywhere in Suffolk,

614
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,708
and I can pretty much tell you
whose land it's from.

615
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:49,791
There you go.

616
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,958
Excuse me.
Do you know Basil Brown?

617
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,250
- Do you know where he lives?
- Yes, I know Basil.

618
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,666
He lives on a farm outside of the village.
Carry on that way.

619
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,875
Thank you so much.

620
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,208
I found that ship.

621
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:35,083
I may not be a fellow at Cambridge,
but I worked out what was down there.

622
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:39,208
And Jacobs and Spooner, too,
and nobody'll remember that.

623
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,708
You don't know that.

624
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:43,458
And if you're not around
to see it to the end,

625
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,750
there's even less chance.

626
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,750
You always told me your work
isn't about the past or even the present.

627
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,000
It's for the future.

628
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:55,541
So that the next generations
can know where they came from.

629
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:58,833
The line
that joins them to their forebears.

630
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:00,333
Isn't that what you always say?

631
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:05,416
Yeah, something like that.

632
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:08,208
Why else would the lot of you
be playing in the dirt

633
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,708
while the rest of the country
prepares for war?

634
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,791
Because that means something, innit?

635
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,416
Something that'll last longer
than whatever damn war we're heading into.

636
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,166
Good hell.

637
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,416
That's Robert.

638
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,791
Robert?

639
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:31,875
Robert!

640
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:33,625
Mr. Brown!

641
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:37,000
Robert, have you cycled all this way?

642
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:38,083
You promised.

643
00:51:38,958 --> 00:51:39,916
May! May!

644
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,541
You said you'd show me the cosmos.
You promised.

645
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:46,791
- Good heavens! Who have we here?
- This is Robert Pretty.

646
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,166
Robert, I'm Mrs. Brown.

647
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:51,458
I bet you have a rare thirst
after that long ride, don't you?

648
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,583
Come you here.

649
00:51:53,666 --> 00:51:55,958
- Let's get you a cup of milk.
- That's a long way.

650
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:57,666
Does your mother know you're here, Robert?

651
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,916
- How'd you find your way?
- She know you cycled?

652
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,541
- Should I take your bike for you?
- Yes, please.

653
00:52:02,625 --> 00:52:04,916
I better find a telephone, May.
Call Mrs. Pretty.

654
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,583
- Thank you.
- He's all right.

655
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:22,666
- He's inside. Uh, come this way.
- Thank you.

656
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:25,125
- We were obviously very worried.
- Yes. He's… He's…

657
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,250
Uh, this is May, my wife.

658
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,458
- Mrs. Pretty.
- Thank you very much.

659
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:32,833
He's been no trouble. A lovely boy.

660
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,458
Mrs. Brown has a music box from Whitby

661
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,666
covered in all manner of shells.

662
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,875
Would you like to see?

663
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:42,083
Uh, no.
We've imposed on your kindness enough.

664
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,166
What were you thinking?

665
00:52:45,291 --> 00:52:47,125
You could have been lost or killed.

666
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:51,416
- Robert… what were you thinking?
- I'm sorry, Mother.

667
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,875
Uh, Robert came to remind me
of a promise that I made.

668
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:58,458
I said I'd show him the stars
through my telescope.

669
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,041
Didn't I?

670
00:53:00,833 --> 00:53:02,125
Then you're returning?

671
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,291
I am. Yes.

672
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:11,416
Thank you.

673
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,208
Morning!

674
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,875
Morning.

675
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:29,458
Mr. Grimes. I've been, uh… taking notes.

676
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,333
If they be of any use.

677
00:53:32,416 --> 00:53:34,291
Why, they'd save me days.

678
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:39,500
- You must have suspected what was here.
- Well, you've made good progress.

679
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,166
As did you.

680
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,250
Thank you kindly.

681
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:46,708
- It's fine work, Mr. Brown.
- Yeah. Well, we made a start.

682
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:50,541
- Phillips.
- Our excavator has returned.

683
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,458
Morning.

684
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,541
<i>There's a sign</i>
<i>in the bottom of the ship</i>

685
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:56,125
that there could be an intact chamber.

686
00:53:56,208 --> 00:53:57,916
Tremendously exciting.

687
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,208
What about events
in the wider world, C.W.?

688
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:09,166
How do you think it will affect us?

689
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,250
Judging by last night's news…

690
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,833
I think we could be at war
in a matter of weeks,

691
00:54:15,333 --> 00:54:18,166
and every excavation
in the land will stop.

692
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:21,916
So, it's up to us.

693
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,666
- Oh, good lord.
- Gosh.

694
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,250
- Jim! Billy Grimes!
- Stuart!

695
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,416
- How the devil are you?
- Very well.

696
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,625
- This is my wife, Margaret.
- Peggy.

697
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,916
Mrs. Piggott,
a pleasure to meet you.

698
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,541
Mr. Phillips, I... um,
I wanted to say how pleased I was

699
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:41,291
that you specifically asked
for me to come.

700
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,875
I know Stuart sent you my paper
on Bosnian Lake villagers.

701
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,500
It was awfully good of you to read it.

702
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:50,500
Ah, yes. Um, very stimulating.

703
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,000
I hope
I'll be able to repay your faith in me.

704
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,458
I have no doubt.

705
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:58,458
It's just that I haven't done
much actual fieldwork yet.

706
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:01,833
Uh, so I wouldn't want you to think
I'm more experienced than I really am.

707
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:04,875
Ah, you have all the key attributes.

708
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:06,833
Do I?

709
00:55:06,916 --> 00:55:08,875
- This ship is very delicate.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:55:08,958 --> 00:55:12,291
One could say, it,
um, scarcely exists at all.

711
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,083
Too much weight, it disintegrates.

712
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:20,416
You're probably less than nine stone,
so I'll supervise from here

713
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,458
while you light things
get on with the digging.

714
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,208
Am I to understand
you only asked for me because of my size?

715
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,000
Uh, lucky guess, actually.

716
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,041
Yeah, thank God
Piggott didn't marry a piglet.

717
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,208
Carry on!

718
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:53,000
- How does it look to you?
- Sir?

719
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:02,291
What have you got there?

720
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,291
All right, then.

721
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,625
- First round's on me, chaps!
- Very nice of you.

722
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,750
Do they not have a… a double?

723
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,250
Sorry, darling, no.
This is fine, though, isn't it?

724
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:05,166
We don't…
We don't want to start by making a fuss.

725
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,000
Oh, no. Of course not.

726
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:11,375
We're so lucky to be part of this.

727
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,041
Yes.

728
00:57:13,916 --> 00:57:17,166
- Yes, it's going to be amazing.
- Mm.

729
00:57:22,625 --> 00:57:24,625
Would you prefer this bed…

730
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,291
Or… or… or that one?

731
00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:29,250
I'll… I'll take this one, shall I?

732
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:37,958
You need to find a star
and identify its direction of travel.

733
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,541
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, Mrs. Pretty.

734
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,583
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello, darling.

735
00:57:47,125 --> 00:57:49,625
Do space pilots navigate using the stars?

736
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:51,583
<i>Oh, most certainly, they do.</i>

737
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:56,916
Ten more minutes, Commander. Then, bed.

738
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,750
I see a star.

739
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:32,833
All right.

740
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,666
- Oh, God!
- What's going on?

741
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,333
- It just gave way.
- Get her off there!

742
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:46,916
- Piggott, get her off!
- Oh, I'm so sorry!

743
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,666
- I didn't mean to damage anything.
- Oh, you…

744
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,083
- What you got, Brailesford?
- You all right?

745
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Sort of rusted lumps.

746
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,916
Come on, man.
Where's your training?

747
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,041
Uh, an amorphous mass
of corroded objects, sir.

748
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:03,541
You, get your camera down there.
Photograph it.

749
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,791
That's… That's very hot in the full sun.

750
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,458
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

751
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:12,250
Watch your step there.
This could well be our chamber.

752
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:14,958
Some barley water, Mrs. Piggott?

753
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:18,708
- Thank you. So clumsy.
- Oh, not at all.

754
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,041
- That's a very lovely skirt.
- Oh.

755
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:28,541
Completely useless.
I don't have anything more suitable.

756
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:31,083
- We came straight from our holiday.
- Did you really?

757
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:33,750
- Yes.
- Well, come to the house.

758
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,916
Let's see what we can find.

759
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:41,333
Is Mrs. Pretty still poorly?

760
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,833
She says she's perfectly fine, but…

761
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:49,333
…that's typical of her.

762
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:56,041
Damn this weather.

763
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,125
Losing a whole day.

764
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:03,791
So little time before world events…

765
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,208
Confound us.

766
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,833
It's a race, an absolute race.

767
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,666
Then you are wasting
the talents of Mr. Brown.

768
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,625
Well, that's an excellent idea.

769
01:00:18,125 --> 01:00:21,875
Stuart couldn't fault his work.
Could he not be unearthing the stern?

770
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:24,416
Mr. Brown isn't qualified.

771
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,625
Well, that's just snobbery,
isn't it, Mr. Phillips?

772
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,000
Brown!

773
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:38,875
Brown!

774
01:00:40,083 --> 01:00:41,875
Brown, come here, man!

775
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,041
Oh my God, Margaret.

776
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,875
Sorry. I forgot to lock the door.

777
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:08,416
No, you see,
we… we… we share that bathroom

778
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,500
with… with four other rooms,
and, you know, I could have been anyone.

779
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:15,916
Um, I could've been Grimes or Phillips.

780
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,500
But you're not. You're my husband.

781
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,458
Yes,
but how… how do you think I'd feel

782
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,583
if… if one of them saw you in that state?

783
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:26,125
Oh! In what state?

784
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:29,750
In this state?

785
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,625
Christ, I... Stop.

786
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,208
You should be more careful. It's…

787
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:40,416
You know, now, after… after waiting eons,
I shall… I shall go and have my bath.

788
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,333
- Mr. Spooner.
- Right.

789
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:18,541
- Morning, Mr. Piggott.
- C.W.

790
01:02:22,666 --> 01:02:26,083
- You might have woken me.
- I didn't like to.

791
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,750
You made me appear late.

792
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:41,750
Careful, Stuart.
You've got a delicate line now, man.

793
01:02:41,833 --> 01:02:43,458
- Very delicate.
- You ready?

794
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:44,791
- Yeah.
- Just a moment.

795
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:47,791
You have to be very careful now.
No cavalier lifting.

796
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,125
- Very gently.
- Yes, sir.

797
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:55,291
On my count. One, two, three.

798
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:57,958
And we do it this way.

799
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,083
Don't move.

800
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:23,416
Piggott, look.

801
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:33,666
Where did you find it, darling?
You clever girl.

802
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:36,791
Phillips!

803
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,333
- Look at this, sir.
- Look. Look!

804
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,916
- Ah, good Lord.
- His face!

805
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:48,416
Phillips.

806
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:52,125
- Mrs. Pretty, there's more.
- And here. And here too.

807
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,541
There's much more.

808
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,791
<i>Could you both, uh,</i>
<i>cast your eyes on this, please?</i>

809
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:37,500
<i>I, uh, found it down between the strikes.</i>

810
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,791
I believe that's a Merovingian tremissis.

811
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,583
- Late 6th century.
- Can't be.

812
01:04:44,416 --> 01:04:48,791
Viking East Anglia didn't have
a coin-based economy till the 9th century.

813
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,291
Well,
I think that the ship is older.

814
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,000
Mr. Brown has always said so.

815
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,708
This is Anglo-Saxon.

816
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:10,208
Piggott! Grimes!

817
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:12,791
It's Dark Age, by Jupiter!

818
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,250
Sixth century!

819
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,583
This changes everything.

820
01:05:16,666 --> 01:05:20,875
These people
were not just marauding barterers.

821
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,375
They had culture!

822
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,125
They had art!

823
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:26,125
They had money!

824
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,833
Well, Vikings are out the window.

825
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,875
- C.W., look.
- God's sake.

826
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:32,208
Oh, good God.

827
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:38,791
Brown has just shown me
a Merovingian tremissis.

828
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,333
That's Anglo-Saxon.

829
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:45,750
It's incredible!

830
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,958
<i>Hello.</i>

831
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:08,541
Are you camping out here?

832
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:12,125
No. That's where my cousin Rory sleeps.

833
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,583
Is he not allowed indoors?

834
01:06:15,666 --> 01:06:18,458
No, he…
he thinks the house is too hot.

835
01:06:19,083 --> 01:06:22,333
- I can imagine.
- He's going to join the RAF.

836
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:25,500
- Is he?
- They're sending his papers any day.

837
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,250
He's going to get his wings.

838
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:37,000
Well done, everybody,
on a splendid effort.

839
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,208
Brailesford, Piggott,

840
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,083
if you'll start loading the gold
into the car,

841
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:44,083
we'll get it
straight to the British Museum.

842
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,791
I beg your pardon?

843
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,625
Well, it's the obvious place for it,
Mrs. Pretty.

844
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,291
London is preparing for air raids.

845
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,958
The British Museum is currently
being emptied of its treasures, isn't it?

846
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:02,250
Uh, yes,
but, um, it… it'll go to the lab.

847
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:05,583
This treasure came
from someone's grave.

848
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:10,041
There'll be an inquest, as you know,
and its fate will be decided there.

849
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,333
Until then, Mr. Brown…

850
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:15,000
As the finder of this magnificent ship,

851
01:07:15,083 --> 01:07:17,166
would you please take the treasure
up to the house?

852
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,083
Uh, yes, Mrs. Pretty.

853
01:07:19,166 --> 01:07:20,666
Thank you all very much.

854
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:26,000
Right, uh, gentlemen,
I'll need some assistance. Mr. Lomax?

855
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,875
<i>This is most irregular.</i>

856
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:30,625
<i>It all belongs to Mrs. Pretty,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>

857
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,208
<i>It's found on her land.</i>

858
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,375
Well, surely,
the inquest will decide

859
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:37,166
whether the treasure
belongs to Mrs. Pretty or the Crown.

860
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:40,333
Piggott, do you want
this treasure to go to the Ipswich Museum?

861
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,041
Am I doing the right thing?

862
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,000
It's someone's grave.

863
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
No, that's…
that's life what's revealed.

864
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:53,791
And that's why we dig.

865
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,208
Just in here.
I think that's best.

866
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:25,500
They're like emissaries
from another world.

867
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:36,083
{\an8}<i>I used to camp</i>
<i>with Robert's father, you see.</i>

868
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,083
I remember him telling me the calls
of all the birds.

869
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,791
Now, whenever I hear nightingales,
I think of these woods.

870
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:45,583
- Are there nightingales?
- Haven't you heard them?

871
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,666
No.

872
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:51,125
Never heard a nightingale at all.
Only on the wireless.

873
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:54,500
There's a wonderful cellist
called Beatrice Harrison.

874
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:57,750
In the summer evenings,
she used to practice in the garden, and…

875
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,708
One night, she was playing a scale,
and a… a nightingale joined in.

876
01:09:02,791 --> 01:09:05,250
At first, she couldn't believe it.
She started playing a sonata,

877
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:08,041
and the nightingale accompanied her.

878
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:10,333
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

879
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:13,333
Yes. It happened again
the next night and next night.

880
01:09:13,416 --> 01:09:14,916
Miss Harrison was so excited about it,

881
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,791
she went to the BBC
and told them all about it.

882
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:17,708
And?

883
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:20,000
So, a few evenings later,

884
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,291
the BBC came
and put their recording equipment

885
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:23,875
in Miss Harrison's garden.

886
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:28,916
She started to play,
and they waited and, um, waited…

887
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,125
And…

888
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:35,000
And at last,
the nightingale began to sing.

889
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:39,791
Went on for about 15 minutes…

890
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,875
Rising and falling with the cello.

891
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,333
No.

892
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:48,791
- Yes.
- Wow.

893
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,291
I know. Hmm.

894
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:59,958
But…
the really extraordinary thing is that…

895
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:05,000
Other people who'd been listening
to the broadcast in their gardens

896
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,625
reported that other nightingales
also started to sing.

897
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:11,958
Well, that's wonderful.

898
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:16,750
Yes, it was. It <i>was </i>wonderful.

899
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,791
Margaret!

900
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,375
- Come on!
- All right. Hmm.

901
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:29,416
Well… good night.

902
01:10:31,875 --> 01:10:34,291
I shall listen out
for cellos in the woods.

903
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:40,083
"Cellos."

904
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:01,500
- Here we are, chaps.
- All right.

905
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:03,666
Well,
we are unburying a legend.

906
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,166
- Beowulf.
- Arthur, King of the Britons.

907
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,291
Cheers.

908
01:11:07,375 --> 01:11:11,291
Talk about Dark Ages.
I can hardly see my pint.

909
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,750
What actually is that?

910
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:15,083
It's the,
uh, trial blackouts, C.W.

911
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:19,875
So Germans will be coming by air
this time, will they?

912
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:22,916
Last time, they came by the river.

913
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,250
In AD 600.

914
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:29,708
You know, I'm…
It's been a big day. I'm quite done in.

915
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,625
Um, will you all excuse me?

916
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:34,833
- Aw.
- Well done, Mrs. P, on a marvelous find.

917
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,791
Yes.
Cheers to your clever wife!

918
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:39,291
- Yeah. No, I'll come with you, darling.
- No.

919
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:42,625
No, no. Um, surely you want to celebrate.

920
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:47,583
- Stay for another, Piggott.
- My round. Set them up again, would you?

921
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:52,291
I say, C.W., ask him
if he'll take a Merovingian tremissis.

922
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:56,458
<i>…the press campaign,</i>

923
01:11:56,541 --> 01:12:00,416
<i>the menacing statements of the statesmen
leading the policy of Germany,</i>

924
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,791
<i>the systematic provocation
of frontier incidents,</i>

925
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:06,958
<i>and finally,

<i>of mobilized armed forces</i>

927
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:13,000
<i>at the Polish frontiers
constitute an obvious proof of this.</i>

928
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,208
<i>A Labour deputation called on
the Prime Minister last night,</i>

929
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:20,083
<i>requesting the immediate evacuation
of women, children, and cripples</i>

930

01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:37,500
Not yet.

935
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,333
Not yet.

936
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:51,125
Darling, C.W. wants me to take
some of the corroded iron to the lab.

937
01:12:51,208 --> 01:12:53,000
Uh, we think it might be fragmented armor,

938
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,875
and I… I badly want
to start cleaning it up. So…

939
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:58,666
Am I to come with you?

940
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:03,458
No, because C.W. needs
all the hands he can get here, so, uh…

941
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:05,500
And he's very pleased with you.

942
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:07,041
- Is he?
- Mm.

943
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:11,958
Uh, so I'm taking Brailesford
because the lab's really his thing.

944
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:15,375
- You know.
- Ah. Oh.

945
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:18,333
You're going to have
to be a brick about it, Margaret.

946
01:13:18,416 --> 01:13:19,291
Peggy.

947
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,250
My name's Peggy.

948
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:42,666
I'll… I'll…
I'll miss you very much, Peggy.

949
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:49,333
Sorry to take him away from you.

950
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,500
<i>It was very kind of you</i>
<i>to invite me, Mrs. Pretty.</i>

951
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:01,375
<i>You can't possibly stay</i>
<i>in that pub without your husband.</i>

952
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,791
<i>Mr. Phillips
would bore you quite to death.</i>

953
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:08,208
Um, have you developed any
of your photographs yet, Mr. Lomax?

954
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:12,041
I've made a start. I've got a mountain
to do, and I better get through them.

955
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,916
I could get my papers any day.

956
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:16,791
Rory has been accepted into the RAF.

957
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,541
Should I congratulate you?

958
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,625
I don't know. Cousin Edith didn't.

959
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:27,416
This looks delicious.

960
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:31,125
Bon appétit.

961
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:35,083
Don't be too long, now, darling.
It's late.

962
01:14:35,166 --> 01:14:37,875
<i>And now,</i>
<i>that's a partial eclipse of the moon.</i>

963
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,833
And don't run.

964
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:40,833
<i>Oh</i>,<i> dear.</i>

965
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:42,083
Wait for us.

966
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:46,333
- <i>Isn't that a bad omen?</i>
<i>- Well, they used to think so.</i>

967
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:52,208
It does make you feel
the gods are angry.

968
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:54,333
The people who buried that ship…

969
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,291
What did they believe?

970
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:01,625
Well… they were sailing somewhere,
weren't they?

971
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:06,083
Down to the underworld or up to the stars.

972
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:10,541
<i>Wherever we go when we die.</i>

973
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:17,083
So we're rather coming
to the dregs, aren't we?

974
01:15:17,916 --> 01:15:20,000
The coroner has been in touch.

975
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,416
An inquest has been called for Friday,
and your presence is required.

976
01:15:26,541 --> 01:15:29,458
There's been quite
a lot of public interest in our ship.

977
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:32,541
So afterwards,
I've invited everyone to come and see it.

978
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,208
Uh… everyone?

979
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:38,125
The villagers are coming
and my friends from the county.

980
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:44,083
May I remind you
just how fragile this site is?

981
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,541
Please feel free
to invite your families and friends.

982
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:51,291
Mrs. Pretty…

983
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:57,916
Good God.

984
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,833
Robert?

985
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:18,041
Don't let anyone swim!
It's tidal. The current is fierce!

986
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:19,000
Darling.

987
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:42,416
They train these boys
on rickety planes from the Great War.

988
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:46,000
My husband said,
"If you want your son to die,

989
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:48,000
then let him join the Air Force."

990
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,875
They say
this war will be fought in the air.

991
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,166
What happened, Mother?

992
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,375
Is he all right?

993
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:02,083
- I must get Robert up to the house.
- Shall I take him for you?

994
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:05,791
- He won't want to go.
- Uh, I'll ask him to look after me.

995
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:08,583
Thank you.

996
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:09,916
Robert!

997
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:13,416
- Yes?
- I… I feel rather faint.

998
01:18:14,166 --> 01:18:17,541
Oh, well, when I feel faint,
I have a good lie-down

999
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:18,958
and a big glass of water.

1000
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:21,041
- Do you?
- And that does the trick.

1001
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,166
That's what I need.

1002
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,083
- Will you take my hand?
- Sure.

1003
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:08,916
<i>His name was David Atkinson.</i>
<i>It was his second solo flight.</i>

1004
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,708
<i>Police and the coroner are here.
I brought you some dry things.</i>

1005
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:22,875
<i>I've got some coffee</i>
<i>back at my tent.</i>

1006
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:27,750
Would you like some?

1007
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,000
<i>My father drowned…</i>

1008
01:19:34,458 --> 01:19:36,000
<i>On a holiday in Cornwall.</i>

1009
01:19:36,541 --> 01:19:38,541
<i>He was taken by the current.</i>

1010
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,708
- <i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

1011
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,333
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

1012
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:45,958
<i>He had epilepsy.</i>

1013
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:51,750
<i>So, what drew you to photography?</i>

1014
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,083
<i>Oh, I suppose it's, um…</i>

1015
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,541
<i>It's just a way
of trying to fix things as they…</i>

1016
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:59,208
<i>As they go past.</i>

1017
01:19:59,291 --> 01:20:02,833
<i>Keep what's vital from being lost.</i>

1018
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:07,583
My father once gave me an old coin…

1019
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:12,166
And he said it was
from the time of Caesar Augustus.

1020
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:18,583
And I knew the story from the Bible
where Jesus showed the disciples a coin.

1021
01:20:18,666 --> 01:20:21,541
"Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar's."

1022
01:20:23,958 --> 01:20:25,625
Yes.

1023
01:20:26,208 --> 01:20:27,583
And I…

1024
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:31,083
…well, I… I became convinced
that the coin I had

1025
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:34,125
was the one that Jesus
had actually shown the disciples.

1026
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:38,750
I used to marvel that I could hold it.

1027
01:20:43,125 --> 01:20:44,750
What happened to your coin?

1028
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,041
I wear it.

1029
01:21:02,041 --> 01:21:03,750
I thought it might bring me luck.

1030
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:07,583
And has it?

1031
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:18,041
If 1,000 years…

1032
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,875
Were to pass in an instant…

1033
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:27,333
What would be left of us?

1034
01:21:29,458 --> 01:21:30,291
This.

1035
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:35,833
And parts of your watch.

1036
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:37,916
Torch.

1037
01:21:39,833 --> 01:21:41,125
Fragments of the mug.

1038
01:21:42,958 --> 01:21:47,583
<i>But every last scrap</i>
<i>of you and I would… disappear.</i>

1039
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:50,666
Listen.

1040
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:51,583
What?

1041
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:09,500
The pilot died, didn't he?

1042
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,666
Yes, darling.

1043
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:17,833
Wait.

1044
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:22,666
<i>Rory won't die, will he?</i>

1045
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:24,166
I'm sorry.

1046
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:25,916
No.

1047
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:36,791
You won't die?

1048
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:06,833
Mrs. Pretty?

1049
01:23:10,458 --> 01:23:12,833
- Are you unwell?
- I've, um…

1050
01:23:12,916 --> 01:23:16,791
- Perhaps you might lead me to my room.
- Yes, of course. Of course.

1051
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:21,208
Are you all right?

1052
01:23:21,291 --> 01:23:23,083
Yes! Yes.

1053
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:25,541
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, no, no. It's…

1054
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:27,208
It's heartburn. It's…

1055
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:29,875
No, I don't want to wake him.

1056
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,750
Mrs. Pretty, are you all right?

1057
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:38,541
I'm such a bore.

1058
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,791
Would you mind…
Would you mind getting me some milk?

1059
01:23:42,875 --> 01:23:44,041
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1060
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,416
- Are you sure?
- Yes, thank you.

1061
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:52,291
Robert! Darling…

1062
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:00,833
Oh! Robert.

1063
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,333
You all right?

1064
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,083
Robert?

1065
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:11,250
I know she's sick. I know it!
There's nothing I can do!

1066
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:14,458
Why is there nothing I can do?
I should be able to make her better.

1067
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:16,833
You do. You do make her better.

1068
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:20,125
No, she's worse. She is, I can see it!

1069
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:24,958
She is.

1070
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,958
When… When my father died…

1071
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:36,500
…everyone said
I had to look after my mother.

1072
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:39,875
And I failed.

1073
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:41,291
I failed.

1074
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:46,625
Robert…

1075
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:51,958
…we all fail.

1076
01:24:54,375 --> 01:24:55,458
Every day.

1077
01:24:56,916 --> 01:24:59,708
There are some things
we just can't succeed at…

1078
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:03,833
No matter how hard we try.

1079
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,750
I know it's not what you want to hear.

1080
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:15,000
I… I'm stronger than she thinks I am.

1081
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:19,583
I know. Perhaps you'll show her.

1082
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:23,625
Now…

1083
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:27,708
We should get you inside, Robert.

1084
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:29,708
Come on.

1085
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:33,083
I think it's time for your bed, you know.
Come on, then.

1086
01:25:45,458 --> 01:25:47,708
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>there's a whole convoy</i>

1087
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:49,333
<i>of hacks on the way.</i>

1088
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:54,541
{\an8}I already have some joker
from the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> asking me

1089
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,083
if the ship is still seaworthy.

1090
01:25:57,166 --> 01:26:01,416
So<i>,</i> what happens to the treasure?
That's the real question.

1091
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,333
<i>Germany has invaded Poland</i>…

1092
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:04,666
Have you seen my wife?

1093
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:06,166
<i>…and has bombed many towns.</i>

1094
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:10,625
<i>Orders completing the mobilization
of the Navy, Army, and Air Force</i>

1095
01:26:10,708 --> 01:26:14,458
<i>were signed by the King at a meeting
this afternoon of the privy council.</i>

1096
01:26:14,958 --> 01:26:16,833
<i>The King and Queen decided...</i>

1097
01:26:16,916 --> 01:26:18,125
Well.

1098
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:20,875
Here we go, then.

1099
01:26:20,958 --> 01:26:24,958
<i>The Queen drove from the palace to visit
the Westminister ARP headquarters.</i>

1100
01:26:54,708 --> 01:26:56,250
I've just received this.

1101
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:03,041
I'm to report
to RAF Martlesham this morning.

1102
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,166
There's the inquest.

1103
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:09,625
It's my medical assessment.
I can't… I can't bunk it. Sorry.

1104
01:27:09,708 --> 01:27:13,166
I put some photographs
in the dining room for your guests.

1105
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:16,333
Rory, I'm telling you
in no uncertain terms

1106
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:17,833
that you cannot possibly die.

1107
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,625
I'm saying this most seriously.
Don't you dare put yourself in danger.

1108
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:29,000
Well… I'm not sure
I shall have much choice.

1109
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,083
Robert is going to need you.

1110
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:35,666
Do you understand?

1111
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:37,875
Good morning, Robert.

1112
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:41,458
- Today's the day.
- I want to take my mother sailing.

1113
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,333
I don't think
that ship is sailing anywhere.

1114
01:27:43,416 --> 01:27:45,708
You know, it's just compacted sand.

1115
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:49,291
There's nothing holding it, except time.

1116
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:52,916
- That won't matter. Not where we're going.
- Now, where's that, then?

1117
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:57,375
- Will you come?
- Well, if I'm invited, I'll come.

1118
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:00,833
- Morning.
- Hello.

1119
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:04,916
Those for me?

1120
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,875
No, I'm looking for my wife.

1121
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,958
Well, perhaps you'd say goodbye for me.

1122
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,375
I've been called up.

1123
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:16,250
Of course.

1124
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,500
Well, best of British.

1125
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,458
Stuart.

1126
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,708
I… I bought you these.

1127
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:26,916
How lovely.

1128
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:35,583
Um, Lomax was just telling me
that he's been called up.

1129
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,625
- Uh, well, it…
- Um…

1130
01:28:44,791 --> 01:28:45,958
Well, I…

1131
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:49,250
Uh, I'd better go. Goodbye.

1132
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:15,458
<i>According to an official telegram,</i>

1133
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:19,125
<i>Warsaw has been bombed six times today.</i>

1134
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,291
<i>The telegram adds that fighting
of a most serious nature continues</i>

1135
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:24,875
<i>on the whole length of the front.</i>

1136
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:27,125
We're in for another bloody mess.

1137
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,291
Oh, here we go.
Did you hear the results?

1138
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:36,291
- I just want a quick photo!
- Mrs. Pretty!

1139
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:37,666
Please, make way.

1140
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,458
Make way, please.

1141
01:29:45,791 --> 01:29:48,208
- Do you want me in the car with you?
- Yes.

1142
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:49,750
Maynard! Maynard!

1143
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,958
Maynard? Can you make sure
my wife gets in the house?

1144
01:29:57,666 --> 01:30:02,125
I… I hope I have
the opportunity to speak to you later.

1145
01:30:03,833 --> 01:30:06,000
- Mrs. Pretty?
- Mrs. Pretty!

1146
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:31,083
I'm terribly sorry.

1147
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:41,291
Thank you. Thank you.

1148
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:47,333
<i>These people</i>
<i>were not savage warriors.</i>

1149
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:49,750
<i>These… These… These were…</i>

1150
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,708
These were sophisticated people
with incredible artistry.

1151
01:30:56,708 --> 01:31:00,375
The Dark Ages are no longer dark.

1152
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,666
This is sherry.
I suppose it's sherry, is it?

1153
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:13,875
I don't know.

1154
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:17,291
Should we drink it now,
or is there going to be a toast?

1155
01:31:17,375 --> 01:31:18,958
What's everyone else doing?

1156
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:29,333
<i>The artifacts discovered here</i>
<i>have caused a national sensation.</i>

1157
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:31,708
You must all know by now

1158
01:31:31,791 --> 01:31:34,708
that they were recovered
from a chamber in the middle of a ship…

1159
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,291
A burial ship, engineered from oak.

1160
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:44,333
In my opinion, the greatest
and most beautiful treasure of all.

1161
01:31:45,708 --> 01:31:49,125
Ninety feet long, lying east to west.

1162
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:53,625
Found and excavated by Mr. Basil Brown.

1163
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,333
- To Basil!
- Mr. Brown!

1164
01:32:16,041 --> 01:32:17,208
I'm terribly sorry.

1165
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:23,583
I thought you'd be pleased
with the verdict.

1166
01:32:30,791 --> 01:32:32,166
We die.

1167
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:36,541
We die and we decay.

1168
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:39,791
We don't live on.

1169
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:45,833
I'm not sure I agree.

1170
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:50,708
From the first human handprint
on a cave wall…

1171
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:55,208
We're part of something continuous.

1172
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:59,916
<i>So, we… don't really die.</i>

1173
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:34,041
Rory put these out this morning.

1174
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:37,333
It completely slipped my mind.

1175
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:53,500
Sit down.

1176
01:34:00,541 --> 01:34:03,708
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>work like yours is very sustaining…</i>

1177
01:34:05,458 --> 01:34:06,916
But it's not enough.

1178
01:34:10,416 --> 01:34:11,875
Life is very fleeting.

1179
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:14,666
I've learnt that.

1180
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:18,166
It has moments you should seize.

1181
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:28,208
It could not be a better result,
Mrs. Pretty.

1182
01:34:28,791 --> 01:34:30,541
The whole of Suffolk
has been on your side.

1183
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:32,666
- Yes.
- I saw you in her car.

1184
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,666
Did she mention her intentions?

1185
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:39,833
- About the tea?
- About the treasure, man.

1186
01:34:39,916 --> 01:34:42,166
Yes, what's she planning?

1187
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,416
We hope that you'll agree
that the Ipswich Museum

1188
01:34:44,500 --> 01:34:45,541
is the perfect place for...

1189
01:34:45,625 --> 01:34:49,041
- Can we talk another time? Excuse me.
- Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Yes.

1190
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:51,000
She trusts you, man.

1191
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,791
Don't let her give it to Ipswich.

1192
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,541
The British Museum would buy everything.

1193
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:59,625
It's priceless, of course,
but she'll have to be reasonable.

1194
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:01,916
Are you asking me to plead your case?

1195
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:06,166
Have some lemon drizzle cake,
Mr. Phillips.

1196
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,750
It is most refreshing.

1197
01:35:09,541 --> 01:35:12,500
Thank you so much for what you said.
I could have cheered.

1198
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:18,958
My son has formed a strong attachment.

1199
01:35:19,625 --> 01:35:21,541
Basil's very fond of him, too.

1200
01:35:23,833 --> 01:35:26,291
Perhaps you might let him visit you
from time to time.

1201
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:28,333
Of course.

1202
01:35:29,166 --> 01:35:30,541
We'd be glad to.

1203
01:35:36,375 --> 01:35:38,333
- Back in a tick.
- Right.

1204
01:35:44,041 --> 01:35:47,041
C.W.'s suggesting
we make a move to the ball.

1205
01:35:48,583 --> 01:35:52,291
Hmm. Well, I think
that you should go on…

1206
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:54,125
…uh, without me.

1207
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:56,000
So, will…

1208
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:57,875
Will you follow us?

1209
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,291
I…

1210
01:36:03,416 --> 01:36:04,625
I don't think so.

1211
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:11,750
No.

1212
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:17,000
We both have our own paths
to, um, follow, don't we?

1213
01:36:17,083 --> 01:36:19,708
And I've seen you when you're happy.

1214
01:36:20,625 --> 01:36:21,916
You're rather beautiful.

1215
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:24,500
I'm happy with you.

1216
01:36:29,666 --> 01:36:32,166
I could… I could learn to be.

1217
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,250
I think that would be an awful shame.

1218
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:38,833
Stuart! Shall we wait?

1219
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,208
Let's… Let's go. Come on.

1220
01:36:44,416 --> 01:36:45,333
Go on.

1221
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,333
Go on.

1222
01:37:26,458 --> 01:37:28,708
May…

1223
01:37:29,208 --> 01:37:32,583
That site, it needs to be made safe
for the future,

1224
01:37:32,666 --> 01:37:35,166
so it… it don't further decay. So…

1225
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:38,208
That's another week's work.

1226
01:37:40,208 --> 01:37:43,041
You say your goodbyes to the old girl.

1227
01:37:44,416 --> 01:37:45,958
Do you take care of her.

1228
01:37:52,375 --> 01:37:54,458
You… You don't want to stay the night?

1229
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:57,041
I'll see you next week.

1230
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:15,458
<i>I'll line the hull with hessian…</i>

1231
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:19,500
<i>And cover that
with a… a layer of branches…</i>

1232
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:23,000
<i>To protect it
from the weight of the earth.</i>

1233
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:25,083
All this soil's got to go back in.

1234
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,250
Leave it as we found it.

1235
01:38:30,708 --> 01:38:33,208
I'm giving the treasure
to the British Museum.

1236
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:36,375
As a gift.

1237
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:42,625
It should be where the greatest number
of people can freely see it.

1238
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:46,750
I haven't told them yet.

1239
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:49,500
I wanted to tell you.

1240
01:38:50,666 --> 01:38:53,208
Well, that's a…
That's a hell of a big gift.

1241
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:57,625
I don't know
anyone's ever made a gift as big as that.

1242
01:38:58,333 --> 01:38:59,875
Apparently, they haven't.

1243
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,750
I also told Mr. Phillips that I expect
your work to receive proper recognition.

1244
01:39:13,708 --> 01:39:14,666
Thank you.

1245
01:40:27,041 --> 01:40:29,958
- <i>Steer it steady, Mr. Brown.</i>
<i>- Aye</i>,<i> aye.</i>

1246
01:40:30,041 --> 01:40:32,000
We're coming towards the edge
of the atmosphere.

1247
01:40:32,083 --> 01:40:33,625
Can you see it, Mother?

1248
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:35,750
We're sailing into the cosmos.

1249
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:39,250
Yes, I can. Where are we heading?

1250
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,500
Orion's Belt, to take the Queen home.

1251
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:44,458
Which Queen?

1252
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:49,041
This boat's hers. Her people gave
her treasure for her home voyage.

1253
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:56,083
<i>And she was sad</i>
<i>when the ship came…</i>

1254
01:40:57,375 --> 01:41:01,291
<i>Because she knew
she'd be leaving everyone behind.</i>

1255
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,625
And she was worried

1256
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:08,375
that they wouldn't get on
very well without her…

1257
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:13,041
But she knew
she had to follow the King into the sky.

1258
01:41:14,041 --> 01:41:15,541
And so, she set off…

1259
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:19,750
Through the Earth and up into the cosmos.

1260
01:41:20,958 --> 01:41:23,458
Space is a funny thing.

1261
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:28,875
Time operates quite differently up there,
and 500 years can pass in a flash.

1262
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,458
And the Queen looked back down to Earth.

1263
01:41:34,166 --> 01:41:38,791
She could see that her son had grown up
and that he was now a space pilot.

1264
01:41:43,041 --> 01:41:47,250
And she knew that when he made
his first journey up to the stars<i>,</i>

1265
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:50,166
she would be there to meet him.

1266
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:06,000
<i>This morning, the British ambassador</i>

1267
01:42:06,083 --> 01:42:10,708
<i>in Berlin handed
the German government a final note…</i>

1268
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,125
<i>Stating that,
unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock,</i>

1269
01:42:17,625 --> 01:42:22,708
<i>that they were prepared at once
to withdraw their troops from Poland,</i>

1270
01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:26,166
<i>a state of war would exist between us.</i>

1271
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,750
<i>I have to tell you now</i>

1272
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:32,041
<i>that no such undertaking
has been received,</i>

1273
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:38,333
<i>and that, consequently,
this country is at war with Germany.</i>

1274
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:40,875
- Good night, sir.
- Good night to you.

1275
01:42:43,041 --> 01:42:47,416
<i>You can imagine</i>
<i>what a bitter blow it is to me</i>

1276
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:51,250
<i>that all my long struggle
to win peace has failed.</i>

1277
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,125
- Good night to you.
- Good night.

1278
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,750
<i>The government have made plans</i>

1279
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:02,916
<i>under which it will be possible
to carry on the work of the nation</i>

1280
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,625
<i>in the days of stress and strain
that may be ahead…</i>

1281
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,500
<i>…but these plans need your help.</i>

1282
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:20,333
<i>You may be taking your part</i>
<i>in the fighting services</i>

1283
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,250
<i>or as a volunteer.</i>

1284
01:43:24,083 --> 01:43:26,375
<i>If so, you will report for duty</i>

1285
01:43:26,458 --> 01:43:29,250
<i>in accordance
with the instructions you receive.</i>

1286
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:43,083
<i>It is of vital importance</i>
<i>that you should carry on with your jobs.</i>

1287
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:49,166
<i>Now, may God bless you all.</i>

1287
01:43:50,305 --> 01:44:50,588
