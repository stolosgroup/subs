00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,086
<i>Hello?</i>

5
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:10,531
<i>Who is this?</i>

6
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:12,102
I gotta ask you something.

7
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:14,840
<i>Ray?</i>

8
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:21,253
I tell you something I did...

9
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,525
something bad...

10
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:26,396
you gotta tell the cops?

11
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:40,425
<i>Ray, where are you?</i>

12
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,094
Doesn't matter.

13
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:03,536
I did it.

14
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:07,612
<i>What did you do?</i>

15
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,521
I killed my father.

16
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,213
<i>Shit runs downhill.</i>

17
00:05:00,684 --> 00:05:03,223
Father to son.

18
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,427
Father to daughter.

19
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,074
What do you need, sweetheart?

20
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:17,184
To not be awake.

21
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:26,169
Please just leave me alone.

22
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:14,231
You all right?

23
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,076
I'm not gonna be able to do it,
Ray.

24
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:21,412
Do what?

25
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,717
You and I both know
I won't make it in prison.

26
00:06:27,823 --> 00:06:28,894
It's taken care of.

27
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,730
What is?

28
00:06:30,797 --> 00:06:32,234
You're leaving tonight.

29
00:06:34,337 --> 00:06:35,306
Where?

30
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:37,710
LA, for now.

31
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:38,914
Lena will meet you at the gate

32
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,052
with another ticket
and a passport.

33
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:48,233
Okay, so where
the fuck am I going?

34
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,874
Maybe it's better
if you don't know for now.

35
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:14,050
Be not inhospitable
to strangers,

36
00:07:14,117 --> 00:07:17,357
lest they be angels
in disguise.

37
00:07:17,424 --> 00:07:18,358
To Smitty.

38
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:19,360
To Smitty.

39
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:47,702
You got old, huh?

40
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:50,575
You owe me 80 bucks.

41
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:52,145
What for?

42
00:08:52,212 --> 00:08:54,317
- My Cutlass.
- What?

43
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:57,957
You double-parked my Cutlass
in front of the Stop & Shop.

44
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:00,628
I don't recall, Matty.

45
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:01,865
I didn't, neither,

46
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:03,835
till I got pulled over
two years later.

47
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:06,707
$20 ticket times four.

48
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:10,214
Oh. Okay, yeah.

49
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,321
Here.

50
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:17,328
Here's 53.
You know I'm good for the 27.

51
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:21,303
I know what you're good for,
Mick, and it ain't money.

52
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,342
That's where you're wrong,
Matty.

53
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:25,879
Look here.

54
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:38,404
The fuck is that?

55
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:41,311
Something for your ex-wives
to fight over.

56
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:53,167
How much you looking for here?

57
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:56,440
Jim's son Kevin
was gonna give me 20 mil.

58
00:09:56,507 --> 00:09:58,477
We were right
in the middle of the draw.

59
00:09:58,544 --> 00:09:59,746
Yeah?

60
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:01,951
And then we hit
that little snag.

61
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,989
And what was that?

62
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:07,529
I think you must've heard,
Matty.

63
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:09,165
Heard what?

64
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:13,374
Declan got shot.

65
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:18,082
So who shot Declan?

66
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,123
Your son?

67
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,470
Yeah.

68
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:30,608
Which one?

69
00:10:30,675 --> 00:10:32,378
Daryll.

70
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:33,714
The Black one?

71
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:35,417
Right.

72
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,759
Why the fuck would he do that?

73
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:42,665
Crime of passion, Matty.

74
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:43,868
Declan killed his girl.

75
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:44,970
You can't hold a man
accountable

76
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,606
for getting vengeance
over love.

77
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,916
Well, Jim Sullivan
won't see it that way.

78
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,522
You wanna move those papers,

79
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:58,063
you're gonna have to go through
Declan's people to do it.

80
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,238
I got no problem with that.
Do you?

81
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,508
You don't think
they'd be loyal to Declan?

82
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,117
I'm thinking it's paper
worth 20 mil.

83
00:11:08,184 --> 00:11:10,989
At that number,
no one's fucking loyal.

84
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,442
Grandpa Michael
wasn't a mobster.

85
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:22,578
Sure he was.

86
00:11:22,644 --> 00:11:25,952
No, he was just
a mean son of a bitch.

87
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,023
Oh, come on.
He was in the mob.

88
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,758
- He wasn't.
- He was.

89
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:32,331
He wasn't.
Sorry, Bunch.

90
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,568
He used to work the door
at Rose's hotel.

91
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:35,637
Mm-hmm.

92
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:36,941
Wow.

93
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,911
I remember that fucking place.

94
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,814
No, you don't.
You was too young.

95
00:11:40,882 --> 00:11:42,484
Yeah, actually I do.

96
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:46,593
Mom, she used to drop
me and Bridge off there

97
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,828
when she had shit to do.

98
00:11:47,896 --> 00:11:50,534
We'd sit at the bar

99
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,645
and drink cokes
with the cocktail waitresses.

100
00:11:55,711 --> 00:11:56,712
Waitresses?

101
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:00,988
Oh, and they fucking played gin
all day long.

102
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,324
I mean, they taught us.

103
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:03,760
I remember there was...
there was...

104
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,231
there were two Black ones,

105
00:12:05,297 --> 00:12:08,836
and there were two white ones
and they were obese.

106
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:12,377
But fuck it.

107
00:12:12,444 --> 00:12:15,083
They were nice
cocktail waitresses.

108
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,619
They weren't
cocktail waitresses, Bunch.

109
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,856
Yeah, and that hotel,
it wasn't no hotel.

110
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,060
No.

111
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,570
It was a fuckin' whorehouse?

112
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:29,745
Proud descendants
of whoremongers

113
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:30,982
on your grandmother's side.

114
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,316
Did you know that, Daryll?

115
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,421
You're two generations away
from being a pimp.

116
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:35,624
Two? One.

117
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,363
Yeah, he was a pimp.

118
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:40,634
It all makes sense, though,
when you think about it.

119
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,804
What?

120
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:46,012
I mean, raised in a whorehouse?

121
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,583
Beat every day?

122
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,588
It's probably the reason
Mickey is the way that he is.

123
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,570
Dancing.

124
00:12:59,637 --> 00:13:00,406
What?

125
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:02,644
That's what he should've done.

126
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:05,083
Mick should've been an
instructor at Arthur Murray.

127
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,588
Ballroom shit?
He'd be good at that.

128
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:12,631
With the leather pants
and a disco ball buckle on it?

129
00:13:13,934 --> 00:13:16,138
Cheatin' old ladies
outta their husbands' money.

130
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,941
Yeah. Hey, hey.

131
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:23,353
Don't worry, darling.
'Cause it's all in the hips.

132
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,827
Oh, you fucking call that hips?
Give me a break.

133
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,597
Oh, hey, hey, it's electric.

134
00:13:29,664 --> 00:13:31,402
No, it's not.

135
00:13:31,469 --> 00:13:34,174
It's fucking pornographic.

136
00:13:34,241 --> 00:13:36,277
Take it back!

137
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:38,281
Oh!

138
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,188
- And up!
- Oh!

139
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,796
Bring it back now.

140
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:49,470
Take it back,
take it back, take it back. Oh!

141
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,774
And hey!

142
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:57,119
You're up.

143
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:59,157
What are you doing?

144
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,863
Nothing. We were just...

145
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:03,765
No, I know.
I'm sorry.

146
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:04,667
I know what you're doing.

147
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:07,506
I'm just, um,
trying to figure out why.

148
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:09,678
Bridge.

149
00:14:09,745 --> 00:14:12,450
We didn't mean
anything by it, Bridge.

150
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,735
Why is it so easy
for you to forget?

151
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,307
Forget what, sweetheart?

152
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,380
Someone's life.

153
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,223
To just...

154
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,327
drink it all away
as if someone's life

155
00:14:34,394 --> 00:14:37,433
is just another bullshit story
to tell.

156
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,743
Another notch
in Mickey's belt.

157
00:14:44,814 --> 00:14:47,185
Along with...
with all the other stories,

158
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:49,357
all the...

159
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,327
whores and killers and thieves

160
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:53,498
that you're
so fucking proud of.

161
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:04,721
That is what Mickey did to you.

162
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:10,265
All of you.

163
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:18,482
That's what makes you so alike.

164
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,357
He taught you how to forget.

165
00:16:35,134 --> 00:16:36,703
Hey.

166
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,674
<i>Were there many people
at the funeral?</i>

167
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:40,878
Just us.

168
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:48,360
We're postponing Declan's
till we find my father.

169
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:56,443
Ray, you there?

170
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,113
<i>You home?</i>

171
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,449
Yeah.

172
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,290
I'll be right over.

173
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:23,864
Everything is such a mess.

174
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:31,880
There's something
I gotta tell you.

175
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:39,128
What?

176
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,072
About your father.

177
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,853
What is it, Ray?

178
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,124
He's gone, isn't he?

179
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:11,961
My father's gone.

180
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:23,816
We did everything Mickey said.

181
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:28,294
We gave him everything
that he wanted.

182
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,164
I'll get you the papers back.

183
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:42,187
I don't... I don't care
about the fucking money, Ray.

184
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,287
Are you coming?

185
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,064
<i>She would've been better
off if she never met me.</i>

186
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,071
<i>What does that mean, Ray?</i>

187
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:14,718
I got what I had coming.

188
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:17,992
<i>What did you have coming?</i>

189
00:20:00,877 --> 00:20:02,346
Ray Ray.

190
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,561
Fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly.

191
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,684
Everybody's looking at you.

192
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,487
They're thinking
you ain't got balls.

193
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,491
That what you want 'em
to think?

194
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:51,377
Ray Ray, trust me, all right?
I'll catch ya.

195
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:53,316
Come on, kid.
Trust me.

196
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,405
<i>There is a time
for everything.</i>

197
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,543
<i>A time to be born.</i>

198
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,752
A time to die.
A time to plant.

199
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,793
And a time to pluck up

200
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,730
the thing
that has been planted.

201
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:38,911
Body of Christ.

202
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:43,187
Body of Christ.

203
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:48,597
Body of Christ.

204
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,001
Amen.

205
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:02,292
Body of Christ.

206
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,825
Who the fuck are you?

207
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:12,231
My name's Ray Donovan.

208
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,371
Mick's son?

209
00:25:15,438 --> 00:25:17,040
Yeah.

210
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:18,910
The one who moved out West?

211
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,049
To become an agent
or something?

212
00:25:21,984 --> 00:25:23,087
Someone told me you were

213
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:24,789
banging that broad
from the movies.

214
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,092
The one from the cult show.

215
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,463
What's her name with the big...

216
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,966
You heard from my father?

217
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,372
Mick?

218
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:36,445
Not in 15 years.

219
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:39,853
Why, did you lose him
or something?

220
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,754
What's that for?

221
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:59,292
If you see him.

222
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:59,311
Stay strong,
stay strong.

223
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,098
We all loved her, Raymond.

224
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,774
I've been transferred
to another diocese

225
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,378
in Pennsylvania.

226
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,055
I'm so sorry to be leaving.

227
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:26,232
I'm gonna miss you
and the boys.

228
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,980
You have been an angel
to this family, Raymond.

229
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,961
I hope you know that.

230
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,368
To all of us.

231
00:28:10,686 --> 00:28:13,292
- You're fucking late.
- For what?

232
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,232
That shitshow?

233
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,633
You think I'm gonna
sit in there

234
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,472
and watch that cocksucker
desecrate my daughter's body?

235
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,314
At least he was there.

236
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:41,481
She was my baby, Raymond.

237
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:43,152
That fucking fairy's
got no business

238
00:28:43,219 --> 00:28:45,088
going anywhere near my babies.

239
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:49,063
Never seemed
to bother you before.

240
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:54,774
You're a piece of shit, Mick.
You always have been.

241
00:29:06,464 --> 00:29:08,668
What do you want, boy? Huh?

242
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,814
I should've killed him then.

243
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,592
<i>And then what?</i>

244
00:29:23,665 --> 00:29:25,502
I don't know.

245
00:29:25,569 --> 00:29:28,341
Maybe none of this
would've happened.

246
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:29,576
<i>You're probably right.</i>

247
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,114
<i>None of it
would have happened.</i>

248
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,952
No wife,

249
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,393
no kids,

250
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,427
no life.

251
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,269
Probably better
for everyone if I had.

252
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,543
<i>That's some sacrifice, Ray.</i>

253
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,723
You'd be willing to give up
all those years...

254
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:58,434
...all that life...

255
00:30:00,072 --> 00:30:02,643
...just for him?

256
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,875
What can I get you?

257
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,181
Whiskey, please. Neat.

258
00:30:57,953 --> 00:30:59,889
Was that Matty Gleeson
who just walked out of here?

259
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:01,159
What?

260
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,462
Am I fucking Facebook
all of a sudden?

261
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:06,704
Am I asking the wrong guy?

262
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:25,275
Was my makeup running
or something?

263
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:29,783
No. Sorry.

264
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:36,863
I'm Evelynne.
What's your name?

265
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,434
Ray.

266
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,604
Well, you look like you had
a rough day, Ray.

267
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,709
Yeah?

268
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,214
You mind?

269
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:47,652
Sure.

270
00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:07,258
My day was a fuckin' doozy.
Pfft.

271
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,763
A real four-star shitshow.

272
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:10,764
Yeah?

273
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,734
Work over at the Gap.
Manager now, you know?

274
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:16,243
It's all right.
The benefits don't suck.

275
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,712
Keeps the rent paid.

276
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:19,748
And I get 40 percent off
the clothes, which, you know.

277
00:32:20,884 --> 00:32:22,187
But today, it was like

278
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,824
the fucking running
of the bulls.

279
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:26,730
This whole busload
full of Japanese tourists.

280
00:32:27,598 --> 00:32:28,766
You'd think they'd never seen

281
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,737
a pair of flat-front khakis
before.

282
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,040
I mean, what the hell
do you think we are?

283
00:32:32,108 --> 00:32:34,846
What did you say your name was?

284
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:36,683
I didn't.

285
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,488
Well, whoever you are,
finish your drink.

286
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:41,459
We're closing.

287
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:49,942
For the bottle.

288
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:50,810
Nice to meet you, Evelynne.

289
00:32:50,877 --> 00:32:52,115
Yeah.

290
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,460
Come on, dance with me.

291
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,998
Dance with your girlfriend.

292
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,368
Come on, Ray.

293
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:37,571
Hey. Ray.

294
00:33:37,637 --> 00:33:39,475
Ray?
Come on. Look at me.

295
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:43,683
Look at me, baby.
Look at me.

296
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:48,025
You all right?

297
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,128
Yeah.

298
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:02,387
I'll be right back.

299
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,191
I'm gonna use the girls' room.

300
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,398
Hey, how you guys doing?

301
00:34:38,259 --> 00:34:40,063
Bridget was good people.

302
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:44,136
Wore her heart on her sleeve.
Never a bad word about anyone.

303
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:45,672
Never.

304
00:34:47,177 --> 00:34:48,579
She loved you.

305
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:51,619
She was proud of you.

306
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:58,766
Hey.

307
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,670
She was.

308
00:35:03,775 --> 00:35:04,777
Sláinte.

309
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:07,384
Sláinte.

310
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,953
You look like shit, by the way.

311
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:14,297
Can I ask you something?

312
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,600
Sure.

313
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:17,404
Colleen?

314
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,840
What about her?

315
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:21,177
Why?

316
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,646
Why?

317
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,219
She's a whore.

318
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,824
A fucking coke fiend
and a half-wit.

319
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:28,858
So why?

320
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:35,506
Seriously. Why?

321
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:38,044
I don't know, Abby.

322
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,248
You don't know?

323
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:41,684
I don't know.

324
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:47,630
It's honest, at least.
It's honest.

325
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,015
You know what happens
if my father finds out

326
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:59,220
he's dealing coke
in the bathroom, right?

327
00:36:09,974 --> 00:36:12,413
I mean, he's a romantic,
your father.

328
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:15,085
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

329
00:36:15,986 --> 00:36:18,224
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

330
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:21,964
He may be a cocksucker, Ray,
but he sure loves being alive.

331
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:27,242
Do you?

332
00:36:29,213 --> 00:36:30,415
<i>"Do you?"</i>

333
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:32,586
<i>That's what she said?</i>

334
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:35,926
Yeah.

335
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,531
What do you think she meant
by that?

336
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:42,373
I don't know.

337
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,416
She let him in.

338
00:36:49,452 --> 00:36:51,124
Let who in?

339
00:36:57,503 --> 00:37:00,041
Calabasas.

340
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:02,179
I thought that if we could get
away, we'd be all right.

341
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:03,415
But...

342
00:37:06,354 --> 00:37:08,824
...she let the wolf in.

343
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:11,029
Opened the fucking door
for him.

344
00:37:13,134 --> 00:37:15,605
Who's the wolf, Ray?

345
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,472
Ray?

346
00:38:22,538 --> 00:38:24,007
<i>How is she?</i>

347
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,216
How's who?

348
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:29,853
Bridge.

349
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:32,258
<i>She's asleep.</i>

350
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:33,427
She okay?

351
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:35,164
Yeah, she's okay.

352
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,333
<i>Good.</i>

353
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,335
Where are you?

354
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,037
Boston.

355
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:41,810
<i>Fuck you doing in Boston?</i>

356
00:38:43,747 --> 00:38:46,820
Don't worry about it.
Go back to sleep, Bunch.

357
00:38:56,606 --> 00:38:58,644
Look at this fucking guy.

358
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,181
Come on, Arty.

359
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,685
These fucking twinkletoes.
Look at him.

360
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,999
Hey, all right, fellas.
Hey, it's nice to see you.

361
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,739
- All right, all right.
- Let's go.

362
00:39:14,441 --> 00:39:15,544
All right,
I'm coming, I'm coming. Jesus.

363
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:16,713
Oh, fuck.

364
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,017
Paint the street fuckin' red.

365
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,500
Hey, what the fuck
is this about?

366
00:39:26,566 --> 00:39:27,702
I was just coming to see you.

367
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:28,971
You've been a busy fucking boy,
Mick.

368
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:30,574
What the fuck
you talking about?

369
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:31,876
I'm talking about

370
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,513
the 50 French blenders
you stole

371
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,684
from the back of Sam's truck.

372
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,488
Oh, the Cuisinarts?

373
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,859
Yes, the fucking Cuisinarts.

374
00:39:39,926 --> 00:39:42,898
When you gonna get it through
your thick fucking skull

375
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,869
these guys are not
to mess with, huh?

376
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:46,706
Oh, Jesus Christ.

377
00:39:46,773 --> 00:39:48,844
That's what you're upset about?

378
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,364
Hey, Jim.

379
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:04,375
Jim, I need you to, uh,
just do me a favor.

380
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:07,280
Broaden your fuckin' horizons
for a minute.

381
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:13,927
What?

382
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:16,865
All right. All right.

383
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:18,402
I need to talk to you
for a second, Jim.

384
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:20,573
Oh, fuck.

385
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,817
Hey Ray Ray.
How are the boys?

386
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:30,126
Jim, sit down.
Jesus.

387
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:35,770
All right.

388
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:40,613
So the other day, um,

389
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,419
I'm sitting there
in the Taco Grande

390
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:45,055
and minding my own business

391
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,894
eating my chimichanga
in the corner.

392
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:50,233
And who do you think
walks in the front door?

393
00:40:52,237 --> 00:40:54,942
What the fuck
are you talking about?

394
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:57,981
- Ezra Goldman.
- Who?

395
00:40:58,048 --> 00:40:59,818
Ezra fucking... I don't know.

396
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:01,388
Some Hollywood Jew.
It's not important.

397
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:03,058
What is important

398
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,198
is that they are shooting
a movie right here in Southie.

399
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:07,233
So?

400
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,175
So what the fuck
do they know about Southie?

401
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:12,777
I'm talking to this guy
for ten minutes

402
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:14,114
and already he hires me on

403
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,554
as Sean Walker's personal
technical consultant.

404
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,823
Who?

405
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:20,193
- Sean Walker.
- Yeah.

406
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:22,597
- The movie star Sean Walker.
- Movie star Sean Walker.

407
00:41:22,664 --> 00:41:25,336
Supposed to be some kind of
vigilante priest or something.

408
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:28,308
Yeah. Black Mass,
they're calling it.

409
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,615
Huh? And I'm telling you,
these guys are loaded, Jimmy.

410
00:41:31,682 --> 00:41:33,619
A major motion picture here.

411
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:35,290
Trucks up and down E Street

412
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:37,793
loaded with expensive equipment
and no fucking security.

413
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,067
Oh, come on.
Camera, lights, you know,

414
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,704
trailers, these guys even carry

415
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:44,941
their own
fucking kitchens around.

416
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,718
You wanna make a play
for a hit on 'em, huh?

417
00:41:49,785 --> 00:41:52,891
Well, I talk to this Ezra guy,

418
00:41:52,957 --> 00:41:55,929
he, uh, brings the security
contracts to you.

419
00:41:55,996 --> 00:41:59,237
Boom shakalaka,
you catch my drift?

420
00:41:59,304 --> 00:42:02,243
And, uh, what do you think,
Jim?

421
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,880
Ray here would make
a hell of a bodyguard.

422
00:42:04,947 --> 00:42:07,419
Might even put in a word
with Sean Walker himself.

423
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,865
Ray, you know anything about
these movie trucks coming in?

424
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:18,142
I saw a couple of trucks
over on E Street.

425
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:25,555
How many trucks
we talking about?

426
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,589
Oh, come on Teresa.
Don't do that.

427
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,470
I just want to talk
to my daughter, all right?

428
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,712
Please.

429
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,320
I'm not drunk.

430
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,930
I'm lonely, and I miss her.

431
00:43:06,338 --> 00:43:10,278
When my mother died,
my Aunt Rose told us

432
00:43:10,345 --> 00:43:13,451
we had to stay up all night
watching the body.

433
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:16,724
And when I asked her why,
she said,

434
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,864
"Well, that's what wakes
are for.

435
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,136
To watch the body.

436
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:24,307
To make sure
they don't wake up."

437
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:32,156
We were terrified that she'd
start twitching at any moment.

438
00:43:35,162 --> 00:43:38,935
But also half hoping
that she would wake up again.

439
00:43:43,243 --> 00:43:46,217
Rose went downstairs
and starting cooking stew.

440
00:43:48,488 --> 00:43:50,057
Oh, the smell.

441
00:43:51,527 --> 00:43:53,198
The whole neighborhood
must have smelled that stew

442
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:56,370
because by four in the morning,
we had a full house.

443
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,108
And everyone brought something.

444
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:01,546
Booze, a bag, box of something.

445
00:44:01,613 --> 00:44:03,284
Cakes, cookies.

446
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,791
I came downstairs
and everyone was there

447
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:09,196
sharing stories about my mom.

448
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,179
I never knew
I had so much family.

449
00:44:27,366 --> 00:44:29,469
But you were right,
what you said about us.

450
00:44:31,641 --> 00:44:33,178
That we forget.

451
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:40,457
There's a difference
between drinking to forget

452
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:44,065
and remembering someone the way
they ought to be remembered.

453
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:15,928
Ray.

454
00:45:15,995 --> 00:45:17,164
Ray... Raymond.

455
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:18,534
He's not here.

456
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:22,842
Where'd he go?

457
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:24,846
Boston.

458
00:45:24,913 --> 00:45:26,015
What?

459
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:28,787
He went to Boston.

460
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:30,258
When?

461
00:45:30,325 --> 00:45:33,397
I don't know.
Last night.

462
00:45:33,463 --> 00:45:35,634
He called me,
that's where he told me he was.

463
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:45,287
Raymond, it's your brother.

464
00:45:45,354 --> 00:45:47,391
What the fuck are you doing
in Boston?

465
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:49,596
Mickey.

466
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:51,600
What?

467
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,174
Mickey's in Boston.
He's got those fucking papers.

468
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:57,178
That's probably why
Ray went up there.

469
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,753
No, he's not going up there
for that.

470
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,392
Do you know much
those things are fucking worth?

471
00:46:04,459 --> 00:46:05,527
No.

472
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:07,398
He's not going up there
for the money, Bunch.

473
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:11,439
He's gonna kill Mickey.

474
00:46:11,506 --> 00:46:13,310
You gotta go up there.

475
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:14,846
Right fucking now.

476
00:46:14,913 --> 00:46:16,080
Oh, let me just call.

477
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,385
No, he's not answering.

478
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:20,089
You don't go, then I gotta go.

479
00:46:20,157 --> 00:46:23,130
All right, all right,
calm down.

480
00:46:23,196 --> 00:46:26,970
My dad's in Boston? Why?

481
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:28,540
We don't know, Bridge.

482
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,144
Bunch is going up there
to find out.

483
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:34,451
I'm going with you.

484
00:46:34,518 --> 00:46:36,623
No, Bridge,
that's not a good idea.

485
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,959
I'm coming.

486
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:39,929
No, sweetheart.
It's not safe.

487
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:43,903
I don't care.

488
00:49:19,078 --> 00:49:20,316
Where the fuck you going?

489
00:49:21,552 --> 00:49:24,558
Get up, you piece of shit.

490
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:25,425
Ray?

491
00:49:25,492 --> 00:49:26,794
Get in the fucking car!

492
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,035
Get in the fucking car!

493
00:49:30,102 --> 00:49:32,240
- Come on!
- I'm getting in.

494
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:33,875
- Get in!
- I'm in. I'm in.

495
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:35,378
Stand him up.

496
00:49:36,814 --> 00:49:37,683
Hey!

497
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:41,558
Move! Move!
Get out of the fucking way!

498
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,062
Fuck!

499
00:49:55,852 --> 00:49:56,854
Matty, you fuck.

500
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,203
Fuck.

501
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,106
- Hey.
- Fuck.

502
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:13,721
Raymond.

503
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:16,227
Oh, shit.

504
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:27,417
Son of a bitch.

505
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,759
No, no!

506
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,563
You want some gum or something?

507
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:04,376
Oh, hey, you can hook
my phone up to the Bluetooth.

508
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:05,879
Is this Mickey?

509
00:52:09,452 --> 00:52:11,423
It's his briefcase.

510
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:13,661
What's in his briefcase?

511
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,236
Papers.

512
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,806
What papers?

513
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:27,455
Stocks he wants to trade
for money.

514
00:52:30,327 --> 00:52:34,669
If he hasn't traded it already
for coke and whores, you know.

515
00:52:42,452 --> 00:52:44,522
Do you think
some people are just bad?

516
00:52:57,315 --> 00:52:58,784
Yeah, I do.

517
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:11,576
Coke and whores.

518
00:53:20,427 --> 00:53:21,329
<i>What do you want?</i>

519
00:53:21,396 --> 00:53:23,333
Hey Kev, it's Mick.

520
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,974
Yeah, that was some kind of
fuckup we got caught in, huh?

521
00:53:28,744 --> 00:53:31,048
<i>You know, it had nothing
to do with you and me.</i>

522
00:53:31,115 --> 00:53:33,487
No?

523
00:53:33,553 --> 00:53:35,758
I mean,
Daryll was out for blood.

524
00:53:35,824 --> 00:53:37,160
Shit between him
and your brother.

525
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:39,732
We just got caught,
wrong place wrong time, right?

526
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:41,936
Fuck you.

527
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,676
Still want those papers?

528
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:48,049
<i>You're out of your mind.</i>

529
00:53:48,115 --> 00:53:51,322
I'm having a fire sale,
if you're interested.

530
00:53:51,389 --> 00:53:55,730
75 percent off, today only.

531
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:59,172
Where are you?

532
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,841
Boston.

533
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:06,885
Was that Mickey Donovan?

534
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:10,794
What does he want?

535
00:54:11,863 --> 00:54:13,966
He wants to sell us
our money back.

536
00:55:19,564 --> 00:55:20,700
Fuck.

537
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:42,709
Dad?

538
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:44,915
- Bridge?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

539
00:55:44,981 --> 00:55:48,355
Boston.
I need to talk to Bunch.

540
00:55:48,422 --> 00:55:50,058
Are you okay?

541
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:51,727
I'm fine, sweetheart.
Where's Bunch?

542
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:54,835
Did you do it?

543
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:56,738
<i>Did I do what?</i>

544
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:00,946
Kill Mickey.

545
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,890
No.

546
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:08,395
Tell Bunch to call me,
all right?

547
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:10,932
Tell him I need him
to come get me.

548
00:57:33,631 --> 00:57:35,235
Hold traffic!

549
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:39,376
Pictures up!

550
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:41,514
We're rolling, guys.

551
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,950
Roll sound!

552
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:47,158
Action!

553
00:57:53,705 --> 00:57:56,310
This is... this is bullshit.

554
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:57,946
Cut!

555
00:57:58,681 --> 00:58:00,150
Cut! Cut!

556
00:58:06,429 --> 00:58:08,868
So you just
want me to walk up to him,

557
00:58:08,935 --> 00:58:11,440
shoot him in the back,
and then walk away?

558
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:13,811
Yes, Sean, yes.

559
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:15,514
You reach into your robe
like so.

560
00:58:15,581 --> 00:58:17,919
Just as you approach,
you shoot him in the back.

561
00:58:17,986 --> 00:58:19,790
Then you put the gun
back into your robe

562
00:58:19,857 --> 00:58:21,092
and you simply continue
down the street

563
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:23,197
as if nothing
at all had transpired.

564
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:29,108
That ain't how it works.

565
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:30,745
No?

566
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:32,816
Shoot a guy in the back?

567
00:58:32,883 --> 00:58:36,022
That's, uh, a warning.

568
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:37,859
You wanna make him dead,
you gotta put two in the head.

569
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:39,128
That's what I thought.

570
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:40,298
Not even
a stupid fucking priest

571
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:41,834
is just gonna
walk down the street

572
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,970
and pull out a gun
where anyone can see.

573
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:46,811
Sean, we have worked this out

574
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:48,146
and it will be best
if the blocking...

575
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:50,017
I want to hear
what he has to say.

576
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,228
Show me.

577
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,238
All right.

578
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:03,310
Uh...

579
00:59:05,114 --> 00:59:06,550
- Hey.
- Don't worry.

580
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:07,919
You'll get it back.

581
00:59:07,986 --> 00:59:10,023
Come on, give me the gun.

582
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:14,700
Jesus.

583
00:59:14,767 --> 00:59:16,036
It's rubber!

584
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,279
Fuck. It looks real.

585
00:59:21,346 --> 00:59:24,085
I'll be you.

586
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:26,323
Come on.
You know what to do.

587
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:30,431
All right. Great.

588
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,875
Action.

589
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:43,591
Pow! Pow!

590
00:59:43,658 --> 00:59:44,626
Second one in the head.

591
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:49,702
Everybody's looking
at the car.

592
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:51,439
No one's the wiser.

593
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,714
That's what I
was talking about.

594
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:20,964
Hello?

595
01:00:21,032 --> 01:00:25,674
Bridget took my car, my phone,

596
01:00:25,741 --> 01:00:27,244
and my gun.

597
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:28,413
What?

598
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,349
<i>We were on our way
to come get you.</i>

599
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,352
What for?

600
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,091
To keep you out of prison,
that's what for.

601
01:00:34,157 --> 01:00:36,496
<i>Why the fuck
would you bring Bridge?</i>

602
01:00:36,563 --> 01:00:37,331
She didn't really give me

603
01:00:37,398 --> 01:00:39,801
a fucking option, Ray,
all right?

604
01:00:39,868 --> 01:00:41,071
Look, we're both
worried about you.

605
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,075
What was... what was I gonna say?

606
01:00:43,142 --> 01:00:47,384
All right. All right.
Where are you?

607
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:50,156
Boston.

608
01:00:50,224 --> 01:00:54,030
I need you to get my car.
It's at South Station.

609
01:00:54,097 --> 01:00:55,501
Keys in the console.

610
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:57,504
And come to the Gardner Motel,
room 46, all right?

611
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,501
<i>People who forget.</i>

612
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,070
<i>Who just wipe
their heads clean.</i>

613
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,740
<i>What do you call that?</i>

614
01:01:15,807 --> 01:01:17,777
<i>Repressed memory?</i>

615
01:01:17,844 --> 01:01:20,851
<i>Yeah, repressed.</i>

616
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:23,223
What are you thinking about?

617
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:25,626
<i>Something my daughter said.</i>

618
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:27,530
What? What did she say?

619
01:01:30,304 --> 01:01:32,441
<i>That I was taught to forget.</i>

620
01:01:32,508 --> 01:01:34,578
Taught?

621
01:01:34,644 --> 01:01:38,820
You didn't have
much of a choice, Ray.

622
01:01:38,887 --> 01:01:42,427
Trauma's a thief.

623
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:44,096
The younger you are
when it starts

624
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:47,972
and the longer it went on...

625
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,744
the more memory
it will take from you.

626
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:13,789
Jesus, Ray.
What the fuck happened?

627
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,426
It's not important.

628
01:02:17,063 --> 01:02:18,465
Yeah, but did you find Mick?

629
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,240
No.

630
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:26,114
What about Bridge?

631
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:28,519
Nothing.

632
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,397
Is that her?

633
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:37,337
Yeah?

634
01:02:37,403 --> 01:02:38,839
<i>Your father called.</i>

635
01:02:38,906 --> 01:02:40,376
When?

636
01:02:40,443 --> 01:02:41,812
<i>He's selling
the papers back to me.</i>

637
01:02:41,878 --> 01:02:44,784
<i>I told him to meet me
at our house in Wellesley.</i>

638
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:46,421
<i>I thought you'd wanna know.</i>

639
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:49,159
I gotta go.

640
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:51,030
Whoa, wait, what's going on?

641
01:02:51,097 --> 01:02:52,333
Give me the keys. I gotta go.

642
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,636
No, I'm coming with you.

643
01:02:53,702 --> 01:02:56,608
No. You stay here.
Keep trying Bridge.

644
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:34,317
Lena. Hey.

645
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:36,053
Passport,
Social Security papers,

646
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,624
and birth certificate.

647
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:41,464
This is your access code
to your Bancaribe account.

648
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:43,702
I want you to memorize it
and throw the paper away.

649
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:46,508
Bancaribe. Okay.

650
01:03:47,443 --> 01:03:48,544
Now, I already checked you in

651
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:49,780
and made sure
your passport cleared,

652
01:03:49,847 --> 01:03:52,487
but they're gonna check it
again at the gate.

653
01:03:52,553 --> 01:03:56,193
- Caracas?
- They don't extradite.

654
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:57,529
- Okay.
- All right.

655
01:03:57,596 --> 01:03:59,700
What I want you to do
is go through security

656
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:02,974
and stop for nothing,
not even the fucking bathroom.

657
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:05,313
You're gonna get to the gate,
you're gonna go on the plane

658
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:06,681
and pretend you're asleep.

659
01:04:06,747 --> 01:04:08,251
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

660
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:10,388
So when... when can I come back?

661
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:16,634
What?
I... I can't come back?

662
01:04:17,703 --> 01:04:20,275
Not unless you wanna spend the
rest of your life in prison.

663
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:27,489
Daryll, don't fuck around.

664
01:04:27,556 --> 01:04:30,363
Just get through security
and lay low until your flight.

665
01:04:32,165 --> 01:04:34,135
- Okay?
- Okay.

666
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:48,751
Hello?

667
01:05:50,053 --> 01:05:51,590
<i>Hey.</i>

668
01:05:52,259 --> 01:05:53,795
I'm in Boston.

669
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:56,734
So?

670
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:59,740
<i>So I'm...</i>

671
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,647
I'm standing on the porch
of the house where I grew up.

672
01:06:07,456 --> 01:06:10,795
And I... I don't know,
I got to thinking...

673
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,342
...what if I could get
a do-over?

674
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:25,390
<i>You know, what if I bought
the house back, hmm?</i>

675
01:06:26,327 --> 01:06:27,896
What if I tried again?

676
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,642
<i>I really think we could make</i>

677
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:37,849
<i>some beautiful
family memories here.</i>

678
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:41,188
Brendan, you know
it doesn't work that way.

679
01:06:41,256 --> 01:06:42,258
You know that.

680
01:06:42,324 --> 01:06:43,794
Well, what if it did?

681
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,164
<i>If it did, we'd all go back</i>

682
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:46,367
<i>to the shithole we grew up in</i>

683
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:48,370
<i>and live happily ever after,</i>

684
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:50,574
every single one of us.

685
01:07:01,629 --> 01:07:03,600
You wanna
come out here and visit?

686
01:07:04,903 --> 01:07:05,905
Come out here.

687
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:08,410
<i>I ain't making no promises,</i>

688
01:07:08,476 --> 01:07:12,284
<i>but come out here</i>

689
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:14,188
<i>and you get a job,</i>

690
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:16,124
<i>and get some help.</i>

691
01:07:16,191 --> 01:07:17,928
Maybe I get some help.

692
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:22,938
Maybe.

693
01:07:28,316 --> 01:07:30,387
Maybe.

694
01:07:30,454 --> 01:07:32,258
Best I can do.

695
01:09:53,037 --> 01:09:55,108
Might not be a good time,
Mr. Goldman.

696
01:09:57,547 --> 01:09:59,517
Call me Ezra, please.

697
01:09:59,584 --> 01:10:02,022
Might not be a good time, Ezra.

698
01:10:02,089 --> 01:10:04,327
I'm sorry,
I don't remember your name.

699
01:10:04,394 --> 01:10:06,331
Ray.

700
01:10:06,398 --> 01:10:09,069
Of course. Ray.

701
01:10:13,211 --> 01:10:16,651
Mickey was just teaching me
how to talk Southie.

702
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:18,221
Let's go to the packies
for some jimmies

703
01:10:18,288 --> 01:10:19,424
so I can bang

704
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:21,093
the wicked hot cashier
at Dunkies.

705
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:26,972
You ready?

706
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:28,141
What?

707
01:10:28,207 --> 01:10:29,611
I thought we'd have
some dinner over at Nona's,

708
01:10:29,677 --> 01:10:31,615
maybe take in the town
a little?

709
01:10:31,682 --> 01:10:34,185
Sorry, Ezra.
Not tonight.

710
01:10:34,253 --> 01:10:35,823
No?

711
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,094
I'm working.
You know that.

712
01:10:38,161 --> 01:10:42,669
I'm doing the whole method
thing, and Mickey, he's...

713
01:10:45,276 --> 01:10:48,081
Of course.

714
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,753
Do your thing, bubala.
I love you. Have fun.

715
01:10:50,819 --> 01:10:53,491
You can take the rest
of the night off, too, Ray.

716
01:10:53,558 --> 01:10:54,828
Thanks for everything.

717
01:10:54,894 --> 01:10:57,734
Yeah, just take the rest
of the night off, Ray.

718
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:07,152
Do me a favor.

719
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:08,054
Keep an eye on that one,

720
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:10,090
and call me
if anything comes up.

721
01:11:12,996 --> 01:11:14,868
I'll take care of it,
Mr. Goldman.

722
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:20,745
Ray.

723
01:11:24,754 --> 01:11:27,325
You know what chutzpah is?

724
01:11:27,392 --> 01:11:28,594
No, sir.

725
01:11:30,398 --> 01:11:31,901
Well, you've got it.

726
01:11:33,472 --> 01:11:35,208
Don't worry, it's a good thing.

727
01:12:06,737 --> 01:12:08,474
Oh, you're bad.

728
01:12:12,014 --> 01:12:14,218
You're gonna get me
in trouble.

729
01:12:35,762 --> 01:12:37,566
Whoo!

730
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:49,289
Oh, I got fucking stories.

731
01:12:49,356 --> 01:12:52,161
True ones!

732
01:12:52,228 --> 01:12:55,000
None of the priests I know
are fucking vigilantes.

733
01:12:55,067 --> 01:12:56,270
Ray!

734
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:59,141
Vigilantes?

735
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,545
Hi, baby.

736
01:13:00,612 --> 01:13:02,248
They're too busy putting their
dicks where they don't belong.

737
01:13:02,315 --> 01:13:03,818
What?

738
01:13:05,988 --> 01:13:08,394
You gotta
help me out here, Ray.

739
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:09,930
They had enough fucking coke

740
01:13:09,997 --> 01:13:11,667
to last them
till fucking New Year's.

741
01:13:11,734 --> 01:13:12,702
I gotta close.

742
01:13:12,769 --> 01:13:14,205
They're all corrupt.

743
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:17,511
Yeah, all right.

744
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:18,781
It's why you need guys like me

745
01:13:18,848 --> 01:13:22,389
to keep the scorecard even,
you know?

746
01:13:22,455 --> 01:13:24,157
Ted wants to close up.

747
01:13:24,224 --> 01:13:27,832
Oh, not unless he's out of
fucking whiskey, he's not.

748
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:28,935
Not unless he's out

749
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:30,538
of fucking whiskey, he's not.

750
01:13:34,312 --> 01:13:35,347
Time to go.

751
01:13:36,616 --> 01:13:39,323
Hey, oh, how do...
what do you say...

752
01:13:39,389 --> 01:13:40,592
Southie slang for cash?

753
01:13:40,658 --> 01:13:42,595
Cash.

754
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:50,043
Uh, I will give you,
my good sir, a grand of cash,

755
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:52,715
if you let us
stay another hour.

756
01:13:52,781 --> 01:13:54,217
Ray, lock up.

757
01:13:55,687 --> 01:13:57,124
Come on, Ray.

758
01:13:57,191 --> 01:14:00,797
When are we ever gonna party
with a movie star again?

759
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:03,737
Yeah, Ray, when are we ever

760
01:14:03,803 --> 01:14:05,039
gonna get to party
with a movie star again?

761
01:14:11,286 --> 01:14:12,488
Sure.

762
01:15:11,572 --> 01:15:12,874
Where's Mick?

763
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:14,277
He's gone.

764
01:15:32,514 --> 01:15:35,119
He told me it was yours.

765
01:15:35,186 --> 01:15:36,322
What?

766
01:15:36,389 --> 01:15:37,358
The money.

767
01:15:37,424 --> 01:15:39,193
He told me it was yours.

768
01:15:39,828 --> 01:15:41,197
He didn't take it?

769
01:15:42,534 --> 01:15:43,970
No.

770
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,846
It is yours, isn't it, Ray?

771
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:52,220
What?

772
01:15:52,287 --> 01:15:56,396
It's what you've been after
all along, isn't it?

773
01:15:56,462 --> 01:15:57,964
No.

774
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,369
You wanted the money
and you helped him.

775
01:16:00,436 --> 01:16:01,906
Just say it.

776
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:09,921
Look, Molly.

777
01:16:09,988 --> 01:16:13,963
Ray, where is he?
I'm so tired.

778
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:15,131
I just... I just want you
to tell me

779
01:16:15,198 --> 01:16:17,370
what you've done to my father.

780
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:38,846
I'm sorry.

781
01:17:13,816 --> 01:17:15,319
Ray.

782
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:30,916
Oh.

783
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:15,037
<i>Ray, where is he?</i>

784
01:18:21,884 --> 01:18:24,991
<i>I just want you to tell me
what you've done to my father.</i>

785
01:18:29,132 --> 01:18:30,735
<i>Do you?</i>

786
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:34,844
<i>Do you?</i>

787
01:18:41,256 --> 01:18:42,859
<i>What did you do, Ray?</i>

788
01:18:47,068 --> 01:18:50,508
What did you do, Raymond?

789
01:18:50,575 --> 01:18:54,016
What did you do?

790
01:18:55,285 --> 01:18:57,856
What?
I banged it back like you said.

791
01:18:57,923 --> 01:19:00,328
Yeah, but you're
still drinking it.

792
01:19:03,335 --> 01:19:06,005
You oughta open your mouth

793
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:07,642
and throw the whiskey
back in there

794
01:19:07,709 --> 01:19:09,780
like you're trying to splash
the back of your throat.

795
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,540
You dance good, Mick.

796
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:24,710
Even if it doesn't
really match the song.

797
01:19:26,747 --> 01:19:28,049
Oh!

798
01:19:28,116 --> 01:19:29,820
Oh, shit.

799
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,604
- Sorry.
- You all right?

800
01:19:38,671 --> 01:19:40,207
Sorry, sweetheart.

801
01:19:40,274 --> 01:19:42,011
Take a seat, Mickey.

802
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,447
Gotta sit this one out.

803
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:48,758
Mm, I need a cigarette.

804
01:19:48,824 --> 01:19:49,726
Who's got a cigarette?

805
01:19:52,197 --> 01:19:53,801
Okay.

806
01:20:02,284 --> 01:20:04,021
Your father's
a fucking character.

807
01:20:06,327 --> 01:20:09,532
You know, I'm basing
my whole performance on him.

808
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:11,470
Yeah?

809
01:20:11,537 --> 01:20:13,341
His tough-but-heart-of-gold
stuff, you know?

810
01:20:20,355 --> 01:20:23,327
He's got him good, Ray.

811
01:20:23,394 --> 01:20:25,932
Oh, my God, that's perfect.

812
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:28,803
Don't do that.

813
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:30,842
You shoot a guy in the back,

814
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:32,646
that's a warning.

815
01:20:32,712 --> 01:20:36,686
You wanna make him dead,
pop him in the head.

816
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:37,788
Put the gun down.

817
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:39,091
It rhymes, you know?

818
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:41,229
Two in the head, make 'em dead.
Two in the head, make 'em dead.

819
01:20:41,296 --> 01:20:42,565
Two in the head, make 'em...

820
01:20:48,108 --> 01:20:49,078
Oh, my God.

821
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:55,624
Oh, fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

822
01:20:58,028 --> 01:21:01,302
I killed her.

823
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:04,240
Oh, my fucking God.

824
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:09,953
My life.

825
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,858
My fucking life.
Oh, my God.

826
01:21:15,998 --> 01:21:18,537
Ray, Ray,
what am I gonna do, Ray?

827
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:24,114
What am I gonna do?

828
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,452
I didn't mean to.
I swear to God, Ray.

829
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:29,992
Jesus Christ.

830
01:21:30,059 --> 01:21:32,564
I'm going to prison.

831
01:21:32,631 --> 01:21:36,071
I'm going to fucking prison.
I'm going to prison.

832
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,222
Give me the gun.

833
01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:49,832
Give it to me.

834
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,514
You were in your trailer.

835
01:21:57,581 --> 01:22:01,254
You had a few too many
with Mick and you slept there.

836
01:22:01,321 --> 01:22:03,827
- What?
- Say it.

837
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:11,409
I got drunk in my trailer
with Mickey

838
01:22:11,476 --> 01:22:15,249
and I... I slept there.

839
01:22:33,452 --> 01:22:35,457
- Hello?
- Mr. Goldman.

840
01:22:35,524 --> 01:22:37,561
You better meet Sean
in his trailer.

841
01:22:37,628 --> 01:22:39,331
Now!

842
01:22:39,398 --> 01:22:41,468
I'll call you later
with a place we can talk.

843
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:39,784
Ray Ray. Ray Ray.

844
01:23:39,851 --> 01:23:41,455
Ray.

845
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,894
You okay?

846
01:23:46,531 --> 01:23:47,867
Ray.

847
01:23:49,671 --> 01:23:52,478
You all right?
Unlock the door.

848
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:55,315
Unlock it.

849
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:06,203
You okay? Huh?

850
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:07,907
I gotta call Ezra.

851
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:11,247
Come on.
I'll help ya, I'll help ya.

852
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:12,717
Here, here.

853
01:24:20,331 --> 01:24:21,668
Here.

854
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:33,926
Here.

855
01:24:36,263 --> 01:24:38,401
Just lie down. Just lie...

856
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:47,385
Let me see what you got, Ray.

857
01:24:47,452 --> 01:24:48,755
Let me see it.

858
01:24:50,225 --> 01:24:51,561
Here.

859
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,297
This is bad, Ray Ray.

860
01:24:53,365 --> 01:24:54,867
I gotta find Bridge.

861
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:56,403
Listen to me, Ray Ray.
This is bad.

862
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:58,074
We gotta get you to a hospital.

863
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:59,677
No hospitals, Mick.

864
01:24:59,744 --> 01:25:02,082
Put pressure on this.

865
01:25:02,148 --> 01:25:03,719
I'm gonna get some towels.

866
01:25:39,122 --> 01:25:41,060
Come on, trust me.

867
01:25:44,566 --> 01:25:47,038
You're a good boy.

868
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:51,480
Don't let no one
tell you something different.

869
01:25:51,547 --> 01:25:53,249
You were an angel.

870
01:25:55,087 --> 01:25:56,424
Mick.

871
01:25:56,491 --> 01:25:58,127
What, son?

872
01:25:58,194 --> 01:26:02,267
I know...

873
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:04,005
I know you tried.

874
01:26:06,544 --> 01:26:09,048
You get that money, huh?

875
01:26:09,115 --> 01:26:11,319
No, I didn't take it.

876
01:26:11,387 --> 01:26:13,524
It was yours.
You deserve it.

877
01:26:13,591 --> 01:26:15,295
No, I don't.

878
01:26:15,362 --> 01:26:16,598
Yes, you do.

879
01:26:16,665 --> 01:26:19,302
You deserve the whole world.

880
01:26:19,369 --> 01:26:20,538
What I did...

881
01:26:20,605 --> 01:26:21,940
What you did?

882
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:27,017
You looked after, Ray.

883
01:26:27,084 --> 01:26:28,487
You looked after us.

884
01:26:28,554 --> 01:26:31,025
No. What I did to you.

885
01:26:32,495 --> 01:26:34,032
I want you to know...

886
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:41,747
...you didn't deserve that.

887
01:26:44,386 --> 01:26:45,922
What?

888
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:48,861
Fish gotta swim.

889
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,013
Yeah.

890
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,822
You remember, fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly.

891
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:08,066
I got to love one man
till I die.

892
01:27:09,836 --> 01:27:12,709
Stay with me, Ray.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

When he goes away.

898
01:27:43,002 --> 01:27:47,611
When he goes away,
that's a rainy day.

899
01:27:47,678 --> 01:27:52,187
But when he comes back,
the day is fine.

900
01:27:52,254 --> 01:27:53,424
The sun will shine.

901
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:11,760
What did you do?

902
01:28:25,487 --> 01:28:28,325
It had to stop.

903
01:28:28,393 --> 01:28:30,631
It had to end.

904
01:28:44,290 --> 01:28:46,094
It's all right.

Hey, hey.
I'm gonna be all right.

909
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:28,546
Get her outta here, Bunch.
Please.

910
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:31,586
You hear me?

911
01:29:31,652 --> 01:29:33,389
Get her outta here.

912
01:29:35,191 --> 01:29:37,531
Dad.

913
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:40,937
You're gonna be all right.

914
01:29:41,004 --> 01:29:42,173
Go.

915
01:29:45,078 --> 01:29:46,214
Go.

916
01:31:02,834 --> 01:31:04,838
<i>Ray, are you there?</i>

917
01:31:08,712 --> 01:31:10,616
I know you tried to help me.

918
01:31:14,891 --> 01:31:17,262
Please keep talking to me.

919
01:31:19,667 --> 01:31:23,074
I... I didn't tell him.

920
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,744
<i>You didn't tell him what?</i>

921
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:32,593
I didn't tell him...

922
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,367
that I love him.

923
01:31:36,434 --> 01:31:39,774
And I'm sorry.

924
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:41,745
I'm sorry
for what I did to him. I...

925
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:45,386
What did you do to him?

926
01:31:45,452 --> 01:31:48,892
I put him away.

927
01:31:48,959 --> 01:31:52,032
He didn't deserve that.

928
01:31:52,098 --> 01:31:56,808
Wasn't his fault, but I...
I did it.

929
01:32:01,651 --> 01:32:04,657
Even if I didn't shoot him,
I ended his life 30 years ago.

930
01:32:08,029 --> 01:32:11,805
What do you mean,
"Even if you didn't shoot him"?
