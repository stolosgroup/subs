Woman's voice:
<i>My name is Diana Henriques.</i>

3
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,780
<i>As an investigating reporter
for the "New York Times,"</i>

4
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,700
<i>I had been covering
the Bernie Madoff scandal</i>

5
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,118
<i>from the day it began.</i>

6
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,039
<i>After months of requests
and correspondence,</i>

7
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,710
<i>I was finally able to sit down
and interview Bernie Madoff</i>

8
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,379
<i>on August 24th, 2010.</i>

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,424
<i>Until today,</i>

10
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:53,051
<i>his only visitor
apart from lawyers</i>

11
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,596
<i>has been his wife.</i>

12
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,807
<i>He has not answered
any independent questions</i>

13
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:00,267
<i>about his crime</i>

14
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,561
<i>except when standing
in a courtroom</i>

15
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:03,937
<i>responding to a judge.</i>

16
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,232
<i>On those occasions,</i>

17
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:10,736
<i>he seemed stiff,
almost rehearsed.</i>

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,404
<i>But in our conversation,</i>

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,531
<i>he seemed relaxed,</i>

20
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,366
<i>unfailingly candid,</i>

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,620
<i>earnest, and trustworthy.</i>

22
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,539
<i>That is his talent
and his curse.</i>

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,001
<i>That is what enabled him</i>

24
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,587
<i>to pull off the biggest
Ponzi scheme on record.</i>

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,424
<i>$65 billion.</i>

26
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:37,221
<i>Bernard L. Madoff...</i>

27
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:42,392
<i>inmate number 61727054.</i>

28
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,673
Reporter on radio:
<i>In overseas trading today,</i>

29
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,864
<i>the Nikkei was down over 8%</i>

30
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,659
<i>with Australia's benchmark
not far behind.</i>

31
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,786
<i>The crisis shows
no sign of ending</i>

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,705
<i>as DOW futures are down
this morning on Wall Street</i>

33
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,083
<i>and Main Street
continues to find itself</i>

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,669
- <i>in the crosshairs of the
largest meltdown...</i> - Shit.

35
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,504
<i>Since the Great Depression.</i>

36
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:12,923
<i>Investors and banks
are holding onto their cash</i>

37
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,260
<i>until more certainty can be
flushed into financial markets.</i>

38
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,387
<i>Let's go now to Bob Summers</i>

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,597
<i>with a story on yet another city</i>

40
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,141
<i>going under
from the mortgage crisis.</i>

41
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,811
Summers: <i>I'm in Fresno, California,
where if you look around...</i>

42
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,318
Just let me lead it off.

43
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,529
It's completely fucking crazy.

44
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,531
We can't back down
on this one, Andy.

45
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,658
We're not gonna back down.
We're gonna hold firm.

46
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,702
What, no good
mornings, no hellos?

47
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,161
Dad?

48
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,333
What's going on?

49
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,711
You're giving out
175 mil in bonuses?

50
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,045
- I am.
- In December?

51
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,298
We've had a very strong year.

52
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,278
The year's not over. We don't
know where we're gonna land.

53
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,135
I wanna reward people.

54
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,990
I want them to feel good about
the work they've done here.

55
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,180
There's a reason that the
bonuses go out in February,

56
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,432
especially in this climate.

57
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,601
You're not hearing me.

58
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,914
It's important that people can
take care of their families.

59
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:09,438
Isn't it better to play it safe?

60
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,899
Hang on to any windfall
just in case?

61
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,984
I'm paying out the bonuses now.

62
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,153
Mark: <i>But that's crazy. It
doesn't make any sense.</i>

63
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:21,533
- Peter.
- Bernie, come on.

64
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,286
This isn't a fucking debate.

65
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,331
I'm paying out the bonuses now.

66
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,333
I'm taking care of everybody.

67
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,751
Dad, are you all right?

68
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,629
What's going on with you?

69
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,380
I'm okay.

70
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,257
<i>Okay, are you sure?</i>

71
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,843
Peter:
<i>Bernie, just tell them.</i>

72
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,553
Andy:
<i>Tell us what?</i>

73
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,642
What is it, Dad?
What's going on?

74
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,024
Andy:
<i>What is it, Dad?</i>

75
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,946
I have to talk to you.

76
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,156
Mark: <i>You can. You know you can.</i>

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,033
I know.

78
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,502
Fucking fish bowl here.

79
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:18,006
Fucking fish bowl.

80
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,549
Huh?

81
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,136
Everybody can see
everything in here.

82
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,515
How come we never got
fucking blinds?

83
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,978
- Woman: <i>Hello?</i>
- Bernie:<i> Hello, Ruth.</i>

84
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,540
<i>- Hi.
- The boys and I are heading home.</i>

85
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,147
Ruth:
<i>Why?</i>

86
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,233
Bernie: <i>I have to
talk to you all.</i>

87
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,235
Ruth:
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

88
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,570
<i>- Yeah, we'll be home soon.</i>
- Ruth:<i> All right.</i>

89
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Is it your health?

90
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,876
No.

91
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,111
Let's go in the study
downstairs.

92
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,166
Bernie: <i>There's no
way to... to say it.</i>

93
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,545
<i>None of it is real.</i>

94
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,505
<i>It's all one big fucking lie.</i>

95
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:43,133
- What is?
- The advisory.

96
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,634
It's a fraud.

97
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,803
<i>There are no investments.</i>

98
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,117
What are you talking about? Of
course there are investments.

99
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,892
- I made them up.
- They're on every statement.

100
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,978
- I ma... I made them up.
- I've seen the trades.

101
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,146
<i>They're fake.</i>

102
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,732
It's all fake.

103
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,984
Basically,
just a big Ponzi scheme.

104
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,864
What's a Ponzi scheme?

105
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,407
I took money from some people.

106
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,825
I gave it to others
and I never...

107
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,452
there's nothing left.

108
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,413
<i>There's supposed to be
50 billion.</i>

109
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,373
There's absolutely nothing.

110
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,667
It's all gone.
I spoke to Peter.

111
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,045
<i>I told him I'm gonna
turn myself in next week.</i>

112
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,801
How could you do this?

113
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:30,013
- I just couldn't stop...
- Mark:<i> Bullshit.</i>

114
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,743
It got bigger and bigger
and it just wouldn't stop.

115
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,226
Bullshit.

116
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,270
- I didn't mean for it to get like this.
- No, no, no, no.

117
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,231
You can't do this.
I'm your son.

118
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,776
Dad. Dad,
how could you do this?

119
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,319
<i>I'm gonna set you guys up.</i>

120
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,780
Yeah. It's...
it's all gonna be okay.

121
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,658
There's still
a few hundred million left.

122
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,243
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make sure

123
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,370
that you guys
are all taken care of,

124
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,498
<i>the rest of the family,
some loyal employees.</i>

125
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,917
It's all gonna be good.
I just need a week.

126
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,130
<i>Set us up with what?</i>

127
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,507
<i>With stolen money?</i>

128
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,425
Mark:
<i>He's a criminal.</i>

129
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,636
<i>He's gonna spend
his life in jail.</i>

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
- Andy: <i>Dad, how could you do this?</i>
- Mark:<i> You're not my father.</i>

131
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:21,481
I explained to them
that it wasn't malicious,

132
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,692
that when I started
this problem...

133
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,278
or this crime...

134
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,821
that is was something
that I thought

135
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,781
I would be able
to work my way out of.

136
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:33,076
But that became impossible.

137
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,872
The harder I tried, the deeper
I dug myself into a hole.

138
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,669
But it comes down to one thing.

139
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,088
I refused to accept the fact,

140
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,548
could not accept the fact

141
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,383
that for once in my life
I had failed.

142
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,219
I couldn't... I couldn't
admit that failure.

143
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,432
And what was that failure?

144
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,773
Shortly thereafter, I...

145
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,195
I think I went back
to the office.

146
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,739
Andy was there.
I saw Andy.

147
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,657
Did you two speak?

148
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,868
He did mention that...

149
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,037
that he, uh...

150
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,789
he and Mark were
consulting with a lawyer.

151
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,377
<i>Well, as it turned out,
he went to see Martin London...</i>

152
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,546
<i>much honored lawyer, retired.</i>

153
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,049
- Diana: <i>He's Mark's father-in-law.
- Yes.</i>

154
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,927
Diana:<i> He'd invested a substantial
amount of money with you, right?</i>

155
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,638
Bernie: <i>Well, more than
some, less than others.</i>

156
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,433
Jesus fucking Christ.

157
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,851
50 million?

158
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,812
50 billion with a "B."

159
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,857
Jesus fucking Christ.

160
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,317
All right, I'm in Hartford.

161
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,110
I'll be there
at 3:00 PM.

162
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,740
You have to understand
the money management business

163
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,617
was operating
from a small office.

164
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,680
- Yeah, the office is on a separate floor.
- The 17th floor.

165
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,641
- It's always seemed successful.
- A ton of clients, I think.

166
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,123
- Hedge funds. - I know he'd
even turn people away sometimes.

167
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,771
- But all the trades... - Yeah, the trades
go through European counterparties.

168
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,670
That's why he has
the London office.

169
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,880
And then upstairs on the
19th floor is market making.

170
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,925
- Which is where we work.
- These are not my immediate concerns.

171
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:15,053
But if he plans
to spend the week

172
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,306
distributing
his ill-gotten gains

173
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,225
amongst his relatives,

174
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:22,185
employees, his friends,

175
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,104
<i>then this is not over.</i>

176
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,815
This is a crime in progress.

177
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:30,068
So what are you saying?
We have to turn him in?

178
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,529
You don't turn him in.
You're an accomplice.

179
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,752
Yeah?

180
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,756
Okay, it's all fine.

181
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,216
Yep.

182
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,388
Ruth:
<i>Who is it?</i>

183
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,182
Bernie:
<i>The FBI is here.</i>

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,273
I know why you're here.

185
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,983
Well, we're here to find out

186
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,860
if there's
an innocent explanation.

187
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,240
There is no innocent
explanation.

188
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,203
Is there someplace
we can talk privately?

189
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,788
In there.

190
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,923
Agent: <i>He said he'd been
operating a Ponzi scheme</i>

191
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,590
<i>since the 1970s.</i>

192
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,303
<i>He was so matter-of-fact
about it.</i>

193
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,638
<i>He wasn't nervous,
he wasn't afraid.</i>

194
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,807
<i>He was just very casual.</i>

195
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,685
<i>Well, sir, he claims
to have acted alone.</i>

196
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:47,103
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

197
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,605
I'll bring him in.

198
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,779
Hi, it's Ruth.

199
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,113
Are the boys there?

200
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,825
<i>They're not there.</i>

201
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,454
He won't be coming in today.

202
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,168
Sir, you're gonna have
to remove your belt,

203
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,795
your shoelaces, your tie,

204
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,296
and any jewelry.

205
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,805
- Bernie: <i>This?</i>
- Agent:<i> Yep.</i>

206
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,807
<i>Credit card, cash,</i>

207
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,308
<i>anything in your pockets, sir.</i>

208
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,344
Turn around, please, sir.

209
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,057
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

210
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,517
<i>Palms together.</i>

211
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,945
Put that stuff away.

212
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,655
And call Ike Sorkin.

213
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,931
Investigator: <i>What happened on
the night of December 9, 2008?</i>

214
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,475
Peter:
<i>My brother told me</i>

215
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,894
that his investment
advisory business

216
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,729
was a Ponzi scheme.

217
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,148
And what was your reaction
to hearing that Mr. Madoff

218
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,066
was operating a Ponzi scheme?

219
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,611
Well, I was in total shock.

220
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,757
Investigator: <i>In your first
interview with the government,</i>

221
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,698
<i>you stated that
you idolized your brother.</i>

222
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,720
<i>- Is that correct?</i>
- Peter:<i> Yes, and that's correct.</i>

223
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,702
Investigator: <i>Why did you
idolize your brother?</i>

224
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,080
Peter: <i>Well, because
he was brilliant.</i>

225
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,875
<i>Everywhere you go,
people talked about Bernie.</i>

226
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,793
<i>He was a true pioneer.</i>

227
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,629
<i>Everyone in the industry,</i>

228
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,173
<i>including the highest-ranking
officials at the SEC,</i>

229
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,050
<i>believed that my brother was</i>

230
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:26,221
one of the most honorable
and successful traders

231
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,181
of our time.

232
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,600
Nobody believed that
more than I did.

233
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,936
I revered him.

234
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,274
<i>I trusted him implicitly.</i>

235
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,654
- <i>Sorkin.</i>
- Ike, it's Bernie.

236
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,782
Uh, I'm down at FBI headquarters

237
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,534
handcuffed to a wall.

238
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,744
Ike: <i>Bernie, don't
say another word.</i>

239
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,081
We arrested him this morning.

240
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,791
Was he okay?

241
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,584
I put the cuffs on him myself.

242
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,503
He went quietly
as though he expected us.

243
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,965
Agent Cacioppi:
<i>To be honest,</i>

244
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,758
<i>he looked relieved.</i>

245
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,971
<i>You did the right thing, son.</i>

246
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,319
Man:
<i>Turn to the right.</i>

247
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,285
Yeah, the FBI just processed him

248
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:33,037
and they transferred him
over to Pearl Street.

249
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,248
Yeah, we're heading in
right now.

250
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,834
<i>So you were making money
off of the trades.</i>

251
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,212
There were no trades.

252
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,631
- What do you mean there were no trades?
- I made them up.

253
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,051
- Weren't there statements?
- <i>Every month, they were fake.</i>

254
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,596
Purchase dates, they were fake;

255
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,931
Shares, they were fake;
Options, they were fake;

256
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,433
<i>Returns, they were fake.</i>

257
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,352
So when was the last
trade you executed?

258
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,981
15 years ago.

259
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,027
Attorney:
<i>Who else knew?</i>

260
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,695
I acted alone.

261
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,700
Investigator: <i>When did he tell you
he started this Ponzi scheme?</i>

262
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,702
He didn't.

263
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,747
<i>And the entire time he was
running it, you had no idea?</i>

264
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,708
- No, I didn't.
- Cacioppi:<i> And what was your role at the firm?</i>

265
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,545
<i>I ran the firm's NASDAQ
desk in the late '90s,</i>

266
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,965
added the rest of the
market-making desk in 2001,

267
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,801
and moved to the proprietary
trading desk in 2003...

268
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,720
You're not answering
my question.

269
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:32,305
What exactly
is your role at the firm?

270
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,098
<i>I'm only in the office
a few days a week.</i>

271
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,768
I've been building a separate
business called Madoff Energy...

272
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:39,562
Sir, what is
your exact title at BLM?

273
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,983
Director of Proprietary Trading

274
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,111
and Codirector of Trading.

275
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,740
Investigator: And where did the
money for these loans come from?

276
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:54,035
The loans that allowed you
to buy your loft in SOHO,

277
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,205
your house in Greenwich,
your house in Nantucket.

278
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,416
I assume from the money he
made through investments.

279
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,293
Investigator: <i>On the
private advisory side?</i>

280
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,379
- Yes.
- <i>On the 17th floor?</i>

281
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,800
- Yes. - And you never asked
what went on the 17th floor?

282
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,426
Of course I did.

283
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,262
- <i>You did?</i>
- Yes.

284
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,848
- But...
- But what?

285
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,434
He would always say,

286
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,062
"You run your business
and I'll run my business."

287
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,647
And you never thought

288
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,983
to follow up on those questions?

289
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,403
- You don't understand...
- You're right, I don't.

290
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,238
I don't understand

291
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,324
how you could work in the
same office as your father

292
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,494
for 20 years
and suspect nothing.

293
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,372
<i>Nothing?</i>

294
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,374
<i>Who are some
of your father's clients?</i>

295
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,001
Andy: <i>I'm not privy
to all of them,</i>

296
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:49,716
but, um, Jeffry Picower
was a big one.

297
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,884
Fred Wilpon and Saul
Katz of the Mets.

298
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,846
<i>HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland,</i>

299
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,349
some family friends, Marty.

300
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,395
<i>But he wouldn't talk about
who or what he did for them.</i>

301
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:06,315
Our money was with him as well.

302
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,944
Investigator: So you were never
suspicious of your father?

303
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,487
Never?

304
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,448
Do you not understand
who he was?

305
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,969
I think we're all
beginning to understand

306
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,701
exactly who your father is, Mr.
Madoff.

307
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:18,453
He wasn't just my father.

308
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,123
You know, he was
fucking idolized.

309
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,125
We're talking about a man

310
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,252
who created the modern
market as we know it.

311
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,546
He created NASDAQ.

312
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,923
He's Chairman of NASDAQ.

313
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,634
<i>He's Chairman of the National
Securities Clearing Corporation,</i>

314
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,679
<i>Chairman of the International
Securities Clearing Corporation,</i>

315
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,265
Chairman of the National
Association of Securities Dealers,

316
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,434
which was FINRA before
FINRA fucking existed.

317
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:43,853
Chairman of the SIA
Trading Committee.

318
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,167
- Okay, we understand your point, sir...
- <i>No, I don't think you do.</i>

319
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,566
<i>Chairman of the National
Business Conduct Committee.</i>

320
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,130
- Sir, we understand. - Member of the
SIA Federal Regulation Committee.

321
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,447
- Sir, that's enough. - Chairman of the
NASD Small Order Execution Committee.

322
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,033
I mean, you're asking me
how I didn't know.

323
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,161
Well, I'm asking you.

324
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,623
You're the FBI, you're the SEC.

325
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,874
You investigated him before,

326
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:08,252
so I'm...
I'm asking you

327
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,588
how the fuck did you not know?!

328
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,467
Sir, we are not the focus here.
You are.

329
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,552
You're saying that
you never stepped foot

330
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,012
on the 17th floor?

331
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,557
No.

332
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,685
And why not?

333

Agent: <i>What happened on the
morning of December 11th, 2008?</i>

338
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,168
Man:
<i>Uh, I was in my office</i>

339
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,504
<i>and I got a telephone call.</i>

340
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,548
Agent:<i> Who was on the phone?</i>

341
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,384
Man: <i>It was, uh, Bernie Madoff.</i>

342
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,386
Agent: <i>What did Bernie
Madoff say to you?</i>

343
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,263
Yeah?

344
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,306
Man: <i>Frank, my brother,
is in the office...</i>

345
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,600
- What?
- <i>with the FBI.</i>

346
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,435
What the fuck?

347
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,729
Agent: <i>How old were you when
you first started working</i>

348
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,314
<i>for Bernie Madoff?</i>

349
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,525
I was 19 years old.

350
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,986
<i>In what capacity
had you known him?</i>

351
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,156
Oh, well, he was my boss.

352
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,827
<i>What type of work had you
done for him over the years?</i>

353
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,996
Uh, really anything
he asked me to.

354
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,831
Everything from, you know,
running errands

355
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,792
to running his investment
advisory department.

356
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,170
<i>Did you know why the FBI was
at Peter Madoff's office?</i>

357
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,424
Yes, I did.

358
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,051
<i>And what did that mean to you?</i>

359
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,304
Uh, it meant that
I was going to jail.

360
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,225
Agent: <i>Why did you think
you were going to jail?</i>

361
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,747
Frank: <i>Because I was well aware
of the nature of the operation.</i>

362
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,607
- Agent: <i>And what
was the nature of the operation?</i>

363
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,484
It was a fraud...

364
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,070
simply put.

365
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:02,199
Frank: <i>I always
thought that Bernie</i>

366
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,410
<i>would be able
to make it good, you know?</i>

367
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,140
<i>He had money here, he had money
there, he moved stuff around.</i>

368
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,683
<i>There was always
a lot of moving parts.</i>

369
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,791
<i>Maybe I was lying to myself.</i>

370
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,627
<i>I don't know,
but I... I thought he...</i>

371
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,462
<i>I thought he could cover it.</i>

372
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,841
What the hell is this?

373
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,552
Bernie's been arrested
for securities fraud.

374
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,304
The SEC's getting a court order

375
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,014
to seize control
and shut us down.

376
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,599
Without an investigation?

377
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,892
What could they possibly know?

378
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,144
Whatever Bernie told them.

379
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,608
Sir, who was that gentleman?

380
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,027
He's...
uh, he works here.

381
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,739
- Where?
- Uh, on the 17th floor.

382
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,866
There's a 17th floor?

383
00:20:56,756 --> 00:21:00,132
Annette, Bernie's been
arrested for securities fraud.

384
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,718
The SEC and the FBI
are upstairs right now.

385
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,261
What?

386
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,180
The hell does that mean?

387
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,894
We need your keycard, ma'am.

388
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,820
Come on, come on, come on.

389
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,197
<i>Please, please.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

390
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,869
Agent:<i> Open it.</i>

391
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,373
FBI! Everyone stop
what what you're doing!

392
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,627
FBI! I said stop what
you're doing right now.

393
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,130
<i>Move away from the computer!</i>

394
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,550
Sir, FBI. Do not
touch that computer.

395
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,052
<i>I said move away
from the computer!</i>

396
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,807
Man:<i> Hey, Dan, walk this group out.</i>

397
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,190
Bernie: <i>The advisory was a
completely separate business,</i>

398
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,818
<i>a completely separate entity.</i>

399
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,862
<i>Never the two should meet, ever,</i>

400
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,447
<i>and they didn't.</i>

401
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,949
<i>And I made it that way
on purpose, obviously.</i>

402
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,702
Diana: <i>What about your brother?
Peter's in trouble.</i>

403
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:13,664
- Bernie: <i>Yes. - Because he trusted
you. He did what you told him to.</i>

404
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:18,294
- He did. - <i>And you told him
to do things that exposed him</i>

405
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,880
<i>to this criminal liability
he's facing right now.</i>

406
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,716
How did you
justify that, Bernie?

407
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,511
How did you sleep with that?

408
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,555
I guess the way
I could sleep with it

409
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,724
is that I knew that
Peter didn't know anything

410
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,684
even though I had him do things

411
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,728
which he didn't realize

412
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:38,647
could've implicated him
in this...

413
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,691
in this, um...

414
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,944
crime.

415
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,617
Woman: <i>Bernie was
always needling people.</i>

416
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,661
He would find your weak spot
and he would poke at it.

417
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,998
I mean, that was Bernie and
he could be a real bastard.

418
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,625
But not like this.

419
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,252
<i>I mean, not stealing
people's money.</i>

420
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,588
I mean, at first,
I started thinking,

421
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,925
"My God, you know, did one of the
grandchildren get kidnapped?

422
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,177
Was the 10 million
ransom money?"

423
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,304
What 10 million?

424
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,932
The 10 million that Ruth came in

425
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:16,477
and withdrew
from her Cohmad account

426
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:19,980
and transferred into
her Wachovia account.

427
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,275
I mean, I...
what do I know?

428
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,778
I mean, I'm always watching
crime stories, you know?

429
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:29,031
I fall asleep
every night to "SVU."

430
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,741
And you're saying
on December 10th,

431
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,120
Ruth Madoff withdrew $10 million
from her Cohmad account

432
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,122
and transferred it
to a personal account?

433
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,124
Yes, but that is not unusual.

434
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,793
I mean, think of it
like having an ATM

435
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,586
in your, you know...
your living room.

436
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,505
Except, you know,
when things are going on,

437
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:45,714
you wonder.

438
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,722
Girl:
<i>Mommy's here!</i>

439
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,851
- Woman:
<i>Don't forget your ball.</i>

440
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:59,436
We're gonna go to
Connecticut for a few days.

441
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,105
You know it might snow?

442
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:03,941
No mention of his arrest yet.

443
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,658
- It's my mom.
- <i>Don't answer.</i>

444
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,368
You know what Flumenbaum said...

445
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,287
no contact.

446
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,080
Don't screw around, Mark.

447
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,628
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mark.

448
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,298
- Honey,
I'm, um... I'm with your father

449
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,258
and in order
to release him on bond

450
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,552
they need four signatures.

451
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,721
It's a $10 million bond.

452
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:37,474
- What?
- <i>Ugh, I know. Can you believe?</i>

453
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,101
Anyway, can you get down here?

454
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,020
Uh, I'll text you the address.

455
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,355
Mom,

456
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,566
do you understand
what he's done?

457
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,902
No, honey, Mark,
I know you're angry,

458
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,361
but he's your father.

459
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,947
I'm not doing it.
End of discussion.

460
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,326
Ruth:
<i>Mark.</i>

461
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:05,127
I'll try Andy.

462
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,842
What do you mean
by misunderstanding?

463
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,637
We couldn't get
your sons to sign.

464
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,597
They wouldn't sign?

465
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,641
<i>I'm sorry,
Mr. Madoff.</i>

466
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,018
The boys wouldn't sign the bond?

467
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:23,229
I'm very sorry, sir.

468
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,481
Who... did you
talk to them or did...

469
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,252
<i>No. Your wife was on the
phone with each of them.</i>

470
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,316
Their mother did and they
didn't... they wouldn't...

471
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,488
<i>Um...</i>

472
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,824
Well, there's
no money involved in it.

473
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,035
So did they understand that?

474
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,870
Yes.

475
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,332
Hmm, I don't know.

476
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,587
Marc, it's Daniel Horwitz.

477
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,798
<i>We couldn't get
the four signatures,</i>

478
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,383
<i>but I can get you Ruth</i>

479
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,677
<i>and, um, Peter Madoff's.</i>

480
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:58,222
<i>Okay, hold on.</i>

481
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:01,308
Will you submit to, um,
home detention

482
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,061
with electronic monitoring
and surveillance,

483
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:07,731
<i>homes in Manhattan, Montauk, and
Palm Beach will be pledged,</i>

484
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,401
<i>and yours and Ruth's passports
will be surrendered.</i>

485
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:11,944
<i>Are those terms okay with you?</i>

486
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,696
Um, yeah.

487
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,699
He says yes. Great.

488
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,035
- Okay. - Woman:<i> "The Journal"
just went online with the story.</i>

489
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,349
We have 20 minutes before the
press descends on this place.

490
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,039
Horwitz:
<i>Let's do this.</i>

491
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,724
Mr. Madoff.

492
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,578
Anderson Cooper: <i>It's very
strange and troubling news</i>

493
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,436
<i>out of Wall Street tonight.</i>

494
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:48,272
<i>Former NASDAQ Stock Exchange
chairman Bernard Madoff</i>

495
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,982
<i>out on $10 million bond.</i>

496
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,109
This man
with a stellar reputation

497
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,652
seems to have taken a whole lot

498
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,487
of very smart people
to the cleaners.

499
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,990
The man they trusted
the most with their money,

500
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,367
a NASDAQ chairman 18 years ago,

501
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,369
is now confessing to authorities

502
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,331
he cheated them
of billions of dollars.

503
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,166
And there's a bunch
of big-time investors

504
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,043
wondering how a guy named Madoff

505
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,627
made off with their money.

506
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,924
What's gonna happen, Bernie?

507
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,596
- I don't know.
- Are you gonna go to jail?

508
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,850
Probably.

509
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,769
For how long?

510
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,605
- I don't know, Ruth.
- For a long time or a little?

511
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,023
I don't know.

512
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,233
- What?
- I don't know.

513
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,444
Are they gonna take
the apartment away?

514
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,864
- I don't know.
- What about the houses?

515
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,824
What about the boys
and the grandkids?

516
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:44,203
- Ruth. Ruth, enough.
- Look I just wanna know if...

517
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,206
I'm sorry if I have
questions, Bernie.

518
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,666
I'm sorry if I'm
a little scared, okay?

519
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,877
It's just you always
keep me in the dark.

520
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,587
I keep you in the dark
to protect you.

521
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,131
Yeah, well, it doesn't
feel that way anymore.

522
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,135
I just wanna know
what's going on.

523
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,972
Please, Bernie, don't keep
me in the dark anymore.

524
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,641
Just tell me.

525
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,435
Tell me.

526
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,564
Tell you what, Ruth?

527
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,945
Just tell me, I don't know...

528
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,991
what you did.

529
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:39,466
Bernie:<i> I met Ruth when she was 13.
I was 16.</i>

530
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,635
<i>A friend was having a party
in his basement</i>

531
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,303
<i>Something had happened
to the jukebox.</i>

532
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,347
<i>It got knocked around
when he was moving it,</i>

533
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:49,059
<i>so the only song it'd play
was "Sh-Boom" over and over.</i>

534
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:52,187
<i>She was this tiny, little blonde</i>

535
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,814
<i>with enormous blue eyes.</i>

536
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,190
<i>Just gorgeous.</i>

537
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,109
Very funny, too.

538
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,819
You remember that actress
Goldie Hawn?

539
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,697
- Diana:<i> I do very well.</i>
- Yeah, that was Ruth.

540
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,927
She'd wake up every morning
without a care in the world.

541
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,952
Very lively, very bubbly.

542
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,787
Popular, too.

543
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,165
- Were you popular?
- Oh, yeah.

544
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,500
I mean, I was a
lifeguard at the time.

545
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,043
Best job I ever had.

546
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,982
I mean, why just be some
regular schnook on the beach

547
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:18,275
when you can be
in a guard tower,

548
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,840
everyone looking up at you?

549
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,426
- And you get paid.
- Did Ruth ever get jealous?

550
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,386
Bernie: <i>For the
rest of the summer,</i>

551
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,514
<i>she laid out right next to the...
the guard tower every day.</i>

552
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:29,099
Sometimes I'd
whistle down at her

553
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,393
and she'd look up
and call me a dog.

554
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:33,020
But I liked having her there.

555
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,396
It felt good.

556
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,899
I mean, we've basically
been together

557
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,234
every day
since the night we met.

558
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,529
It's our 51st
anniversary coming up.

559
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:44,406
Mm.

560
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,909
How do you think you were
able to keep it all separate?

561
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,911
For 16 years,

562
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,413
I kept this secret from my wife,

563
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,373
my brother,

564
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,876
my sons.

565
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,508
How I was able to do that

566
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,927
and maintain
any degree of sanity,

567
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,888
well, it's, uh...

568
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,934
that worries me

you pick up a napkin

So who's the more handsome
brother, him or me?

599
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:34,057
All right, we've all heard
this one, Casanova.

600

- Come on.
- In my opinion?

Be honest.

602
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,065
- Peter's way more attractive.
- Oh.

603
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,713
So you've got a thing for barrel-chested
bald men with big stomachs?

"My God, this man looks
just like Lee Majors."

608

- Handsome.
- Thank you, Eleanor.

609
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,955
Yeah, that was 25 years ago.

610
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:59,124
Back then, even you
were attractive, Eleanor.

611
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,834
Stuff it, Bernie.

612
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,086
You know you got a thing for me.
Do not lie.

613
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,880
You're right, I do.

614
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,716

Your accounts
at Madoff Securities

631
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,297
had a total of
approximately $50 million.

632

- Yeah, that's correct.

636
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,849
No! I was
very, very lucky.

637
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,726
<i>Kind of like

638

Kind of like

<i>there must be something
fraudulent there?</i>

643
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:15,826
No. I never thought
of the word fraudulent.

644
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:18,286
In my experience,

645
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,248
and I mean this, there's only
four different types of pussy.

646
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,542
Okay?
I'm dead serious.

647
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,044
You got your... let me show you.
I just saw one.

648
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,879
All right, right there.
See there?

649
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,673
That's your Honda Civic pussy.

650
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:30,882
<i>Gets you where you wanna go.</i>

651
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,968
<i>No shame in this pussy at all.</i>

652
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,886
Reliable.
You just, you know,

653
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,722
you're not gonna be
proud to be seen

654
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,557
riding around town
in it, am I right?

655
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,143
- <i>Nothing against her.</i>
- What's going on?

656
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,186
It's the world according
to Frankie over here.

657
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,708
Frank: <i>Right there.
You see that there?</i>

658
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,231
That's your Buick Regal pussy.

659
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,775
<i>Okay, a step up from the Honda.</i>

660
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,695
Uh, generally
they're cleaner, okay?

661
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,114
Roomier, you fit
more passengers in there.

662
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:57,200
I guess there's pros and
cons to that in a pussy.

663
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:59,286
<i>You know, lovely pussy.</i>

664
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,788
<i>Nobody's gonna mistake it for
a Benz, though. Am I right?</i>

665
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,331
Am I right, Robert?

666
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,666
Okay, thank you.
God bless you.

667
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,168
I just want you to know,

668
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,586
despite everything you see,

669
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,546
Andrew is not from money.

670
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,381
- Oh, no, no.
- He's not from money.

671
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,341
I... I'm not...
I'm not...

672
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,177
I know you might think
he's a rich guy,

673
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,928
but he's not.

674
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,431
We're from nothing.
My father was broke.

675
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,975
We're not rich people.
We're humble people.

676
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,810
- Okay.
- You understand?

677
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,520
Yes.

678
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,022
- Come here.
- Yeah. Oh.

679
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,732
Oh!

680
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:31,526
I'm gonna have to
get out the hose

681
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,278
and spray him.

682
00:34:33,322 --> 00:34:35,197
Next up, my personal favorite.

683
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,865
I just saw one.

684
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,075
There. Now,
don't make it obvious.

685
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,953
Right there. That is your
Lincoln Continental pussy.

686
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,997
<i>Beautiful.
Just... it's just right.</i>

687
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,769
You know what I mean?
Like Goldilocks just right.

688
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:48,084
It's not too fancy,
it's not too plain.

689
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,586
It just...
it's just comfortable.

690
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,254
It just...
it just fits.

691
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,381
No, no, it's like an
old pair of slippers

692
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,801
except instead of your foot,
you put your cock in it.

693
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:59,095
- Am I wrong?
- You have a daughter, right?

694
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,014
Yeah, Sophie.
She's wonderful.

695
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,682
I can't wait
for you to meet her.

696
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,726
And who's the father again?

697
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,478
Um, uh, John,

698
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,605
my... my ex-partner
at Urban Angler.

699
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,190
And you two never married?

700
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,734
Um, no. No.

701
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,986
If I had had
a baby out of wedlock,

702
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,073
my father would have taken
me out back and shot me.

703
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,036
I'm not kidding,
he would've shot me.

704
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,454
No, no, stay with me

705
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,122
and hold all questions
till the end.

706
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,542
- Okay.
- Right there, you see that? Ugh.

707
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,793
There it...
read it and weep.

708
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,920
It's your
Mercedes-Benz pussy.

709
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,214
<i>Right? Look at it.
I mean, it's beautiful.</i>

710
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,716
<i>It's just a feat
of vaginal engineering.</i>

711
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,718
No, it handles just great.

712
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,387
It's sleek, it's tight,

713
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,764
it looks good, it feels
good, it smells good.

714
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,183
But a lot of upkeep.
Yeah?

715
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:49,271
Payments are murder and you gotta
wax it, you gotta polish it,

716
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,607
you gotta talk to it,
you gotta listen to it, eh?

717
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:54,693
<i>And, most importantly,</i>

718
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,194
<i>you gotta remain ever vigilant</i>

719
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:58,697
that nobody
fucking jacks it, right?

720
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,615
You don't have to
worry about that

721
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,201
'cause you'll never get
near anything like that.

722
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,870
So don't worry about it.

723
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,580
Investigator:
<i>Is it fair to say</i>

724
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:09,207
<i>that as a result
of all of these lies,</i>

725
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,750
<i>you got rich?</i>

726
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,004
Well, I didn't get paid
per lie, ma'am.

727
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,673
<i>As a product of the fraud
that was Madoff Securities,</i>

728
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,341
<i>you got rich, correct?</i>

729
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,385
Yeah, that's correct, yeah.

730
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,137
<i>You built, as you described,</i>

731
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,015
<i>a lavish home in Bridgewater,
New Jersey, correct?</i>

732
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,100
- Well, define "lavish."
- Sure.

733
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,853
- Uh, how many bedrooms did it have?
- Five.

734
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,897
- How many bathrooms?
- Seven.

735
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,815
- How many acres?
- Seven.

736
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,234
- Did it have a swimming pool?
- Yes, it did.

737
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,403
- Did it have a tennis court?
- It did not.

738
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,364
- Did it have a pond?
- Yes, it did.

739
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,450

Hey, by the way, you know
Stephanie and I went last weekend

763
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:06,199
to see that house in Nantucket?

764
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,034
- You know...
- You should try the lobster.

765
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,245
- Oh, no, no, it's okay.
- Oh, trust me on the lobster.

766
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,539
Try the lobster.
Hey!

767
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,041
- Dad, you know I got...
- Can you get my son

768
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,960
- a lobster, please?
- a weak stomach.

769
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,795
Would you get him
a lobster? Just...

770
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,274
Would you like me
to get you the lobster?

771
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,276
What are you asking him for?
Just get him a lobster.

772
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,551
- He'll thank us both later, okay?
- Seriously...

773
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,720
So, what's the price tag
on this house?

774
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,514
Mark: <i>Uh, they got it at,

- Bernie:<i> That's what they're asking for?</i>

776
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:32,976
Yeah.

777
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,853
I mean, it's, like, special.

778
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:38,565
It's, like... it's got a pool
looks out over the ocean.

779
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,044
<i>- It's unbelievable.</i>
- Bernie:<i> Uh-huh.</i>

780
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,902
But I figure
we can get them down a bit.

781
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,696
Now, wait.

782
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,948
That's the way
you bring the lobster?

783
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,324
Apologies, sir.

784
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,909
Why don't you bring it back,

785
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,578
take off the claws, open it up.

786
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,538
I mean, I pay enough
for this whole thing.

787
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,665
<i>Don't you guys know
how to serve a lobster?</i>

788
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,729
- Apologies. I'll be right back.
- Okay, just bring it back properly.

789
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,754
- I mean, what is this?
- You wanna come see it with me?

790
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,483
- We could go down next week and...
- <i>I'll go see it.</i>

791
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,132
<i>We can work on the price, too.</i>

792
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,634
<i>Yeah, six and a half,
maybe we can start at five.</i>

793
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,906
- That would be nice.
- Mark:<i> We could probably take a boat from Montauk.</i>

794
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,181
- We can go out of the harbor...
- Good idea.

795
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,310
Okay, thanks.

796
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,938
So... don't eat that,
eat this.

797
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,191
- Don't eat...
- I don't like lobster, Dad.

798
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,212
Bernie:<i> I don't even know why we had that.
I guess your mother...</i>

799
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,944
Mark: <i>'Cause it's not
good on my stomach.</i>

800
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:26,738
Hey, uh,

801
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:28,823
take this away,
will you, please?

802
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,743
Yes, sir.

803
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,661
- There you go.
- Apologies, sir.

804
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:35,955
Bernie:
<i>Okay.</i>

805
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,333
<i>One thing he's good at
is apologizing.</i>

Mark:
<i>I guess I'm just wondering</i>

814
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,561
<i>what if something
happens to you?</i>

815
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,500
<i>We don't know the first thing
about the advisory.</i>

816
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,024
- Frank will handle it.
- Andy:<i> Come on, Dad.</i>

817
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,652
With all due respect, Frank's...

818
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,403
Frank's what?

819
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,781
Frank's an idiot.

820
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,033
You know, Frank
never went to college.

821
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,370
I heard Frank comparing women's
vaginas to automobiles

822
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,080
<i>earlier today.</i>

823
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,352
Whether Frank is refined enough
for your taste is irrelevant.

824
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,708
He's good at his job.

825
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,752
If something
were to happen to me,

826
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:25,130
he'd fill you guys in on all
the details you need to know.

827
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,549
Andy: And what if Frank
decides to screw you?

828
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,176
I mean, I don't even know how much
you're worth. Is it a billion?

829
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,928
Two billion?
Three?

830
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,699
What if there's three
and he says there's two

831
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:35,660
and takes a billion and
rides off into the sunset?

832
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:38,768
Calm down, calm down. Everything is
written down in a safe deposit box.

833
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,895
If something
were to happen to me,

834
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,648
you consult with our lawyers,
and they'll handle it.

835
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,316
They'll fill you in
on everything.

836
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,569
Everything, huh?

837
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,155
- That's right, everything.
- Everything? You know, good luck.

838
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,240
This conversation is impossible.

839
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,345
- I don't understand why you can't understand...
- Impossible!

840
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,244
What I just said to you.

841
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,666
You know, why is it that whenever
this conversation comes up,

842
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,169
you find a way to wriggle
out of giving me an answer?

843
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:05,628
It comes up
because you bring it up.

844
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,589
No, because I'm...
we're trying to plan.

845
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,235
<i>Well, if you don't bring
it up, it won't come up.</i>

846
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,862
You know, I'm just trying
to get a basic sense...

847
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:13,386
You don't have to get
a sense of anything, Mark.

848
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,658
- You don't have to get a sense of anything.
- <i>Why is that too much to ask?</i>

849
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,558
- I've told you this is something I don't talk about.
- Dad. Dad!

850
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:20,894
Listen to me.
I don't understand!

851
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,582
Listen, what is wrong?
Are you a fucking idiot?

852
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:24,439
Are you a fucking idiot?!
I mean, answer me!

853
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,566
- I don't understand!
- No, you don't understand!

854
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,359
You don't have to
fucking understand!

855
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,445
<i>You're asking me about
taking over the advisory</i>

856
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,341
<i>and yet you can't even follow
a simple fucking instruction</i>

857
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,990
<i>to shut the fuck up!</i>

858
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:39,287
You don't understand.

859
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,497
You don't understand.

860
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,333
Leave it alone.

861
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:45,960
Okay.

862
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,009
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:58,514
- Good night.
- I love you, Dad.

864
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,808
Love you.
Good night.

<i>But the truth is
it didn't even occur to me.</i>

876
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,623
I guess it's because
I never thought

877
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,313
of what I was doing
was stealing.

878

Diana: <i>Well, it was a $65
billion Ponzi scheme.</i>

they lost their homes.</i>

as stealing?</i>

882
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:00,285
People felt safe with you.

883
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,704
- <i>Yeah, but these were...</i>
- And yet

884
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,998
you were betraying them all.

885
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:07,125
Well, but these people,
you know,

886
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,751
they had a little greed
in them, too.

887
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,461
There was a little bit
of, you know...

888
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,797
look, you know, and they
didn't wanna look too hard.

889
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:15,883
They looked just far enough.

890
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:20,263
- So they're accomplices in some way, too.
- Bernie.

891
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,515
Accomplices
because they trusted you?

892
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,560
Accomplices because you
were so trustworthy,

893
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,687
you seemed so trustworthy.

894
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,583
Yeah, but there's a lack
of honesty on their behalf,

895
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,817
an unwillingness to take
responsibility for their behavior.

896
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,361
- <i>Your investors?</i>
- Yes.

897
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,530
It takes a lot of chutzpah

898
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:39,449
for you of all people
to say that.

899
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:43,411
You know...

900
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,582
now that I think of it,

901
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,167
my greatest failure...

902
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,627
or maybe it's
my greatest weakness...

903
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:55,173
is I've always wanted
to please people.

904
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,800
And that's...

905
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,094
that's one that can
get you into trouble.

906
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:02,221
- I've been
here all fucking morning!

907
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:05,516
- I wanna go upstairs.
- Sir, nobody's going upstairs right now.

908
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
I wanna see somebody in charge.

909
00:44:07,604 --> 00:44:09,290
<i>- Right now, I'm in charge.
- Who are you protecting?!</i>

Officer: <i>And you need
to back up right now.</i>

911
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,836
- We're talking about my fucking life savings!
- I told you right now!

912
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,445
- Do you understand?
- You need to back up right now, sir.

913
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:27,538
- Eleanor: <i>Hello, Madoff.</i>
- Man:<i> I'm in the fucking lobby.</i>

914
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:28,956
<i>I wanna come up.</i>

915
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,541
Sir, I am not able

916
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,835
to give you permission
to come up here right now.

917
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,962
<i>Where is my fucking money?!</i>

918
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,090
You have to call
the advisory arm.

919
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:41,469
- I can give you their number.
- <i>Fuck you, you fucking thief!</i>

920
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,224
Oh, my God.

921
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,937
Eleanor: <i>Unusual circumstances
did not exist for Bernie.</i>

922
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,730
<i>Take 9-11.</i>

923
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,358
When those towers got hit,

924
00:44:55,402 --> 00:44:58,528
everybody in the whole
entire office

925
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:01,030
was gathered around the TV.

926
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:04,492
Who was crying?
Who was hysterical?

927
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:05,910
Not Bernie.

928
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:10,498
He kept his head down
and he continued to work.

929
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,251
And it is not like

930
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,461
he did not know anybody

931
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,547
in those buildings.

932
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,552
Diana:
<i>As with every event</i>

933
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,263
<i>of personal devastation,</i>

934
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,682
<i>they remember
exactly where they were</i>

935
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,892
<i>and what they were doing</i>

936
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,061
<i>when they learned
they were ruined.</i>

937
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,190
Diana:
<i>The grayish white paper</i>

938
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,985
<i>rolled out of Mary
Thomajan's fax machine.</i>

939
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,446
<i>The fax was from
the small feeder fund</i>

940
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,948
<i>she had trusted for 18 years</i>

941
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,616
<i>telling her that all her money</i>

942
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,035
<i>had been invested with Madoff,</i>

943
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,079
<i>who had been arrested.</i>

944
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,166
<i>She later recalled,</i>

945
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,002
<i>"In the 50 seconds it took
to read that fax,</i>

946
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,671
<i>I went from being
a multimillionaire</i>

947
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:01,674
<i>to having my life savings
wiped out</i>

948
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:05,428
<i>and life as I knew it
altered forever.</i>

949
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,017
<i>Robert Halio's son called him
at his retirement home</i>

950
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,102
<i>in Boca Raton with the news.</i>

951
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:14,937
Man:
<i>It's all gone, Dad.</i>

952
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:18,107
<i>I don't...
I don't know what to do.</i>

953
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:19,901
Diana:
<i>95% of his wealth</i>

954
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:24,113
<i>had been entrusted to Madoff
and was now gone.</i>

955
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:25,990
<i>Mr. De la Villehuchet</i>

956
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,784
<i>had written his brother
a letter that said,</i>

957
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,871
<i>"If you ruin your friends,
your clients,</i>

958
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:34,373
<i>you have to face
the consequences.</i>

959
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,250
<i>He then positioned
a trash basket</i>

960
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:38,169
<i>to protect the carpet</i>

961
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,796
<i>and slit his wrist
with a box cutter.</i>

962
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,300
<i>Tim Murray, a property
manager in Minnesota,</i>

963
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,761
<i>was traveling and nearly
drove off the road...</i>

964
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,222
<i>Fort Lauderdale...</i>

965
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,226
<i>- Richard Freedman...
- David Iselin...</i>

966
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,412
Stephen Colbert: <i>Time to
pay the piper, Bernie.</i>

967
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,332
Presumably...

968
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,752
Presumably with the life
savings of another piper.

969
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:20,836
Just...

970
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,339
This was the worst
pyramid scheme

971
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,842
since the actual pyramids.

972
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,698
- Ruth loves to go to the California Pizza Kitchen.
- Paul Schaffer:<i> Yeah.</i>

973
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,347
And they say
that her favorite dish there

974
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:33,307
is the veal scallo-Ponzi.

975
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,082
Listen, I have something to tell
you that's really important.

976
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:40,147
I have your money!
I can get it to you.

977
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,854
<i>Okay, I guess you're not there.</i>

978
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,156
They can see right in.

979
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,367
- They can see right in.
- What?

980
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:54,287
We... we don't have
any curtains.

981
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,455
They can see right in.

982
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,749
Andy: <i>Hold on, let
me call you back.</i>

983
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,313
- Catherine, it's gonna be fine.
- No, they're gonna be looking in

984
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,254
with their long lenses
and we'll be trapped.

985
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:06,674
They're gonna get bored
just standing around.

986
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:08,759
I'm not the story.

987
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,178
We've gotta get curtains
right now.

988
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,709
Shit.

989
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,302
Hi, how are you?

990
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,012
I'm all right.

991
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,555
You?

992
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,349
I've been better.

993
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,561
I'll bet.

994
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,200
- Mommy, Mommy.
- What?

995
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,953
- Is that Ruth Madoff?
- Jessica, not another word.

996
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,789
It's okay.

997
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,085
No, none of it is.

998
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:46,065
Man: There she is.

999
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,333
- Hi, Sarah.
- Oh, hi.

1000
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,043
Is Gisele here?
I was wondering

1001
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,962
if she might be able
to fit me in today.

1002
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,881
I haven't had my hair colored
in God knows how long.

1003
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,008
- Um, I think she's...
- You know, don't worry.

1004
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,969
- I'll find her.
- Uh...

1005
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:24,019
Ruth: <i>I've been coming
here for 15 years, Pierre.</i>

1006
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,313
Pierre:
<i>I understand.</i>

1007
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,150
<i>We have too many clients</i>

1008
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,233
<i>who have lost their money
because of your husband.</i>

1009
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,864
But I don't trust anyone else.

1010
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,783
I'm very sorry,

1011
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:42,663
but I can't afford
to risk my reputation.

1012
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,251
What about a house call?

1013
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:48,878
I can pay extra.

1014
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,047
- I'm sorry...
- Pierre.

1015
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:54,842
But I have to ask you
to leave now.

1016
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,844
I'm sorry, Ruth.

1017
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,728
- Shit.
- Bernie:<i> Ruth!</i>

1018
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,689
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

1019
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,483
What are you doing?

1020
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,902
- Looking for something?
- My lighter.

1021
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,091
Well, aren't there matches
in the drawer?

1022
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,073
- No.
- No? What do you mean?

1023
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,179
- There's always matches in the drawer.
- Well, we're out.

1024
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:22,036
Where'd you last see it?

1025
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,621
If I knew where I last saw it,

1026
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,790
I wouldn't be looking
for it, Bernie.

1027
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,755
I'm such an idiot.

1028
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,381
<i>How did I get to be this age</i>

1029
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,968
without doing anything
on my own?

1030
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,470
What are you talking about?

1031
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,931
I... I didn't
do anything, Bernie.

1032
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,642
I never did one thing on my own.

1033
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,853
I... I don't have a career,
I don't have a name,

1034
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,981
I don't... I don't have
any friends of my own.

1035
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,442
The only thing I have
are regrets.

1036
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:55,903
That's all I got
to show for myself.

1037
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:59,865
- Regret after regret.
- Ruth, do we have to go into this now?

1038
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:01,784
I got a lot on my mind.

1039
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,286
<i>I'm going away and who knows
if I'm going to come back.</i>

1040
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:07,623
Why would you say that?
- I'm not saying for certain...

1041
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,793
- No, Ike said that you'd be able to...
- Forget I mentioned it.

1042
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,336
You can't do that.

1043
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,004
I'm not ready.

1044
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,215
I... I'm not ready
to be alone.

1045
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:18,008
You're all I have.

1046
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,927
The boys don't speak to me.

1047
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:21,345
No one speaks to me.

1048
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:24,515
I'll...
I'll go crazy, Bernie.

1049
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,978
I'll... I'll go crazy
all alone.

1050
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:32,314
I'll go crazy, Bernie, I will.

1051
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:08,412
Ruth's voice:<i> Hi.</i>

1052
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,227
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

1053
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,771
Man:<i> Bernie!</i>

1054
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,523
<i>Bernie, you there?</i>

1055
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,984
<i>Bernie?
Come on, pick up.</i>

1056
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,714
<i>I know you're hiding
that 50 billion somewhere,</i>

1057
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:21,155
<i>you piece-of-shit
cocksucker.</i>

1058
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,218
<i>I hope you enjoy getting
your ass raped every night,</i>

1059
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:25,200
<i>'cause you're going away
for a long time.</i>

1060
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,244
Hasta la vista,
<i>you kike motherfucker.</i>

1061
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,416
What are you doing?

1062
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,001
Ruth:
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

1063
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,086
Slogging through,

1064
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,922
being miserable to no good end.

1065
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,924
What's the point?

1066
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,842
You know,
I was thinking earlier...

1067
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,303
this... this isn't
even about me.

1068
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,222
This country needs a villain,

1069
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,183
someone to send to the gallows

1070
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,227
so everyone can feel okay about
living under a rigged system.

1071
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,105
I don't give
a rat's ass, Bernie.

1072
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,483
Well, it'll be better once I go.

1073
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:00,277
What's with the jewelry?

1074
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,404
It's the only thing
the court didn't freeze.

1075
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,073
I'm gonna wrap it all up,

1076
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:06,742
give it to family,

1077
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,035
and then kill myself.

1078
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,454
Why would you kill yourself?

1079
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:13,415
Because I'm tired
of being hated.

1080
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,209
I don't even understand it.

1081
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,295
I... you got yourself
into trouble.

1082
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,275
You couldn't get out.
What do I have to do with it?

1083
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,840
Why does the world hate me?

1084
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,218
They all think I'm some kind
of a mastermind.

1085
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,053
Take it as a compliment, Ruth.

1086
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,889
They say all these
horrible things about me.

1087
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,558
They say I...
I was your bookkeeper.

1088
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,769
- <i>They say...</i>
- You weren't my bookkeeper.

1089
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:35,980
I did maintain the records
the first year.

1090
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,524
That was in 1960.
It was just you and me.

1091
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,651
I mean, but you weren't
even a real bookkeeper.

1092
00:54:40,695 --> 00:54:42,965
No, but I'm just saying don't make
it seem like I didn't pitch in

1093
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:45,280
because I even
came back, remember?

1094
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:47,636
- Yeah, but then we hired a real bookkeeper.
- And I helped with payroll.

1095
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,013
- We hired a real bookkeeper.
- Right, so why are they making it seem

1096
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,496
like I... like I'm involved
with all this stuff?

1097
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,456
Because they're out
for blood, honey.

1098
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,625
That's why.
They just wanna...

1099
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:59,503
But anybody in the know knows
you weren't the mastermind.

1100
00:54:59,547 --> 00:55:01,296
- That's nonsense.
- Oh, well, thanks.

1101
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,631
I already wanna kill myself.

1102
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:04,383
Are you trying
to make me feel worse?

1103
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:07,177
No, but I...

1104
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,263
You, uh...

1105
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,432
you'd commit suicide?

1106
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,269
<i>With what?</i>

1107
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:20,524
I don't know. I haven't
figured that part out yet.

1108
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:23,110
Something nice.
Maybe Ambien.

1109
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,698
How much Ambien do we have?

1110
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:30,492
Enough to open
a fucking pharmacy.

1111
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:00,022
What about these?
Klonopin?

1112
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,816
Same thing.
Just put it in here.

1113
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:19,374
Do have yourself
a merry little Christmas.

1114
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,919
It's a great song and you'll be
hearing Judy Garland sing it...

1115
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,338
Ruth:
<i>Can't we just have quiet?</i>

1116
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,424
I can't fall asleep
unless I watch something.

1117
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,552
You just took
a whole fucking bottle

1118
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:31,929
of Ambien, Bernie.

1119
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,014
Sleep's not gonna be
your problem.

1120
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:36,600
My mind races.

1121
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:38,143
Fine.

1122
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,188
Our last night on Earth

1123
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:43,148
will be you, me,
and Judy Garland.

1124
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:46,693
- How romantic.
- Let's not get started, Ruth.

1125
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,658
We had a good life, didn't we?

1126
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,035
Yeah,

1127
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,538

Black Monday,
October 19th, 1987,

1164
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:16,551
<i>when the stock market

losing more in one day

than it did on Black
Tuesday in 1929.

Fucking rigged.

1168

How to fuck the little guy.

1169
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:35,320
I wonder if I can count on you.

- Pop-pop!</i>

00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,830
Bernie:
<i>We took a big hit today.</i>

1174
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,207
<i>Lost over a billion and change.</i>

1175
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,793
<i>You know how with a split-strike
conversion strategy</i>

Frank:
<i>It's like insurance.</i>

1178
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,986
A fucking meltdown like this,
would have been a nice strategy.

<i>If only we had it in place</i>

winners of yesterday's horse races?</i>

1186
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,527
Yeah, so if anyone double-checks
our trades, we got it all there.

1187
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:17,738
- All winners.
- <i>Fine.</i>

1188

Bernie:
<i>Make sure the books show</i>

1189
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:24,077
<i>that the London office
is clearing the trades</i>

01:02:57,191 --> 01:03:00,525
What's he testifying about?

1235
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:01,985
Me.

1236
01:03:02,029 --> 01:03:03,570
<i>Over a nine-year
time span.</i>

1237
01:03:03,614 --> 01:03:05,780
<i>If a $50-billion
Ponzi scheme</i>

1238
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,908
<i>doesn't make
the SEC's priority list,</i>

1239
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,410
<i>then I wanna know
who sets their priorities.</i>

1240
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,538
What made you think that
Bernie Madoff was a fraud?

1241
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,665
The key tip-off... and it
took me about five minutes

1242
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,792
to figure out
that he was a fraud...

1243
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:19,439
<i>I'm gonna give you a hand
signal and I'm gonna show you</i>

1244
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:20,815
<i>what his performance
return line looked like.</i>

1245
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,340
It went in only
one direction... up.

1246
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,300
It never had variation
like the market does

1247
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:27,302
like... like this,
but then I did...

1248
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:30,222
- Who is this guy?
- <i>He tried to warn the SEC about me.</i>

1249
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:34,100
- And what happened?
- They ignored his warnings.

1250
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:36,686
- So what's the point?
- What do mean what's the point?

1251
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,605
Well, what's the point
of all this?

1252
01:03:38,649 --> 01:03:40,649
Well, he's saying
that basically,

1253
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,359
he handed the SEC the evidence

1254
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:43,818
and they didn't follow up on it.

1255
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,154
Oh, so a government agency
is incompetent.

1256
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:47,864
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- Yeah, and that's news?

1257
01:03:47,908 --> 01:03:49,548
No, look, I've been
saying that for years.

1258
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,451
And I have firsthand knowledge.

1259
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:01,962
This fucking cocksucker walks
in and out of the building

1260
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,338
with this jacket on.

1261
01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:04,965
What the fuck is wrong with him?

1262
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,300
Bern, the guy's asking
for our DTC account number.

1263
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,677
What are we gonna do?

1264
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,741
I mean, all my years
dealing with the SEC,

1265
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,349
I've never seen
this enforcement.

1266
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:17,247
Who the fuck does
this guy think he is?

1267
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:19,563
Boss, if we don't
give the guy the number,

1268
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,334
it's gonna be obvious that
we're hiding something.

1269
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,419
Yeah, but the way he just fucking
walks in here like that,

1270
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:25,402
no fucking suit or nothing.

1271
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,362
- No, I know.
- What kind of fucking arrogance?

1272
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:29,739
The jacket's annoying,
but, Bern, please focus.

1273
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,241
If we do give it to him,

1274
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:34,119
uh, one call to the DTC
and that's it.

1275
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,579
Game over.

1276
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:37,539
We're just here
for a routine exam.

1277
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,291
We haven't done one in 10 years.

1278
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,835
- You were just here.
- Uh, we... we weren't.

1279
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:45,046
- DC Inspections was.
- We don't talk to DC.

1280
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,633
So, tell me about this article.

1281
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:51,469
Yeah, I was
very bothered by this.

1282
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,430
I mean, why would
they make me look fat?

1283
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:54,681
Excuse me?

1284
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,433
I mean, look at my face.

1285
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,436
Look at my cheeks. I look
like a fucking porpoise.

1286
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:01,855
Well, um, yes, but I'm
referring to the allegations.

1287
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,858
What about it? Lori Richards
has all this information.

1288
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,776
I sent it to her in a file.
They have it.

1289
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,695
As I told you, we're a
very large organization.

1290
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:11,448
- We don't talk to each other.
- You don't talk to DC?

1291
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,992
N-no.
It... it's, uh...

1292
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,619
This is the problem
with the SEC.

1293
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:17,662
I've been saying this for years.

1294
01:05:17,706 --> 01:05:19,706
I mean, you have to have
better communication.

1295
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,144
How are you supposed
to be able to do your job

1296
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:22,667
with a fraction
of the information?

1297
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,753
Well, we're trying to get
all of the information.

1298
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:27,464
Well, don't you think you
should start by talking to DC?

1299
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,132
I mean, I got...
my whole office here

1300
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:30,320
is wondering what's happening.

1301
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:31,760
You come in with that jacket,

1302
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:33,281
it embarrasses the hell
out of all of us.

1303
01:05:33,305 --> 01:05:35,013
And this?
It's a fucking cartoon.

1304
01:05:35,057 --> 01:05:36,723
It's an old article.
It's four years old.

1305
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,578
And you're asking me questions
about an old article

1306
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:40,268
with a silly cartoon?

1307
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:42,270
And you haven't spoken to DC.

1308
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,105
Are we, um... are we
waiting on your lawyers?

1309
01:05:44,149 --> 01:05:45,732
I never have lawyers
in the office

1310
01:05:45,776 --> 01:05:47,817
when I'm talking to
regulators for two reasons.

1311
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,653
One, I'm not doing
anything wrong.

1312
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,780
Two, I know the rules
better than most

1313
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,657
because I drafted
a majority of them.

1314
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,991
And we haven't met before,

1315
01:05:55,035 --> 01:05:56,993
but we have very strong
relationships.

1316
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:00,288
And I was on the short list
for SEC director.

1317
01:06:00,332 --> 01:06:02,666
Yes, we...
we know that.

1318
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,959
If you need anything at all,
I'll be in my office.

1319
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,045
There's no such thing
as an inconvenience.

1320
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,755
- Thanks.
- I'm here.

1321
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,509
<i>Oh, um,</i>

1322
01:06:12,552 --> 01:06:15,428
by the way, are these
securities with the DTC?

1323
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,722
- Of course.
- We're gonna need your account number

1324
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:20,308
<i>just so we can
verify the assets.</i>

1325
01:06:20,352 --> 01:06:23,269
Oh, Bern, you're
fucking killing me.

1326
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,609
646.

1327
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,319
646.
Great, thank you.

1328
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:32,987
Do you mind if you take
that jacket off

1329
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,364
before you go out there?

1330
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:36,741
- <i>Oh, um...</i>
- Just...

1331
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,785
<i>Sure.</i>

1332
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:40,370
Bernie's voice:
<i>One call.</i>

1333
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,288
<i>All the SEC had to do
was make one call</i>

1334
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,143
<i>and they would've seen
that everything was fake,</i>

1335
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,750
<i>that there was nothing there.</i>

1336
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,752
<i>But they never called.</i>

1337
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:49,921
Diana: <i>You just gambled
that they wouldn't call?</i>

1338
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:52,382
Bernie: <i>It was more than a gamble.
It was...</i>

1339
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,426
<i>it was a leap of faith,
if you will.</i>

1340
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:57,846
Diana: <i>You wait, knowing
what they will find</i>

1341
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,514
<i>if they make that call.</i>

1342
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,224
I can't imagine
what that was like.

1343
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:05,812
It was... it was
excruciatingly difficult.

1344
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,232
At some point, you figured...

1345
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:12,318
I figured
that they didn't do it.

1346
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,613
They just didn't
follow up on it.

1347
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:19,367
<i>If you didn't plan
on killing yourself</i>

1348
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,411
<i>or going into hiding,</i>

1349
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,413
<i>how did you think it would end?</i>

1350
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,206
Well, it was almost like, uh...

1351
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,041
it sounds horrible
to say it now...

1352
01:07:27,085 --> 01:07:29,836
but I just wanted the whole
world to come to an end.

1353
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,546
When 9-11 happened,

1354
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,339
I thought this was
the only way out.

1355
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,717
The world would come to
an end, I'd be dead,

1356
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,510
and everybody would be gone.

1357
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,847
But, I mean,
I could've kept it going.

1358
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:42,432
I could've covered everything.

1359
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:44,392
Even after the fall of '08,

1360
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,456
I had enough commitments of
cash that would've come in.

1361
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,938
So I could've,
you know... I... I...

1362
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,899
I just got tired.

1363
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:53,151
I knew by Thanksgiving
I was gonna give it up.

1364
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:55,612
I was gonna stop.

1365
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,425
<i>Financial turmoil in the US.</i>

hit with these redemptions.</i>

1384
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,456
We gotta find a way to conserve.

1385
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,375
I think we should
lower the returns.

1386
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,252
Are you kidding?
That'll cause a bigger panic.

1387
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,482
They'll all pull out, the greedy fucks.
We can't do that.

1388
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,172
<i>Well, we gotta do something.</i>

1389
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:58,925
We're treading water
like a fucking paraplegic here.

1390
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:01,322
- Man:<i> I was just saying...</i>
- Hold on, let me get rid of this idiot.

1391
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:04,347
The joke on the street is that
Bernie's like the Jewish T-bill.

1392
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,619
- Very funny. I'm on the phone. I'm
on the phone. - He's that safe.

1393
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:07,976
I'm on the phone.

1394
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,894
I'll introduce you guys later.

1395
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:11,312
He's gonna love you.

1396
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,731
See if you can rattle
Fairfield's cage.

1397
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,483
In the meantime,
I've got a few ideas.

1398
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:16,568
- <i>Fairfield?</i>
- Yeah.

1399
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,403
<i>All right.</i>

1400
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:29,122
- Ruth: <i>Uh-huh. Nice, nice.</i>
- Man:<i> Not in a bathing suit.</i>

1401
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,793
Me neither.

1402
01:09:33,837 --> 01:09:36,212
- Hey.
- Hey, kid.

1403
01:09:36,256 --> 01:09:38,506
I heard you're
the one who hustled

1404
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:41,718
those penny stocks in that
shitty office you had downtown.

1405
01:09:41,761 --> 01:09:43,553
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's me.

1406
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:46,514
Can you believe I've known
this man for 50 years?

1407
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:48,391
Carl, listen,
I wanna tell you something.

1408
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:50,476
Not now.

1409
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,187
There are some real opportunities
in the market right now

1410
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,231
and I wanna make you
aware of them.

1411
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:57,275
- Not now, Bernie.
- I know, I know.

1412
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:59,777
- Not now.
- I know. I wouldn't tell you about them

1413
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:01,946
unless they were really,
really important, okay?

1414
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:03,740
I don't want you
mad at me you missed out.

1415
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,742
All right.

1416
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,619
How much do you
want me to put in?

1417
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,662
250.

1418
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:13,958
- On top of the 300 million I
already have with you? - Yes.

1419
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,169
The market in shambles?

1420
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,671
It's plummeting, but now is
the time to take advantage.

1421
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,319
- I'm so exposed... - That's exactly
why I'm proposing this to you.

1422
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:24,552
I'm afraid I'll be arrested
for public indecency.

1423
01:10:24,596 --> 01:10:26,512
Oh, I'm not doing it
with everybody.

1424
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:29,307
- It's just a few people.
- All right, all right. Enough.

1425
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:30,870
- Okay, and you are family.
- I'll tell you.

1426
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,852
Listen, I'll think about it.

1427
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,020
- Okay.
- Okay?

1428
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:35,313
But don't take too long.

1429
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,398
In all seriousness,
don't take too long.

1430
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,359
Please don't take too long.

1431
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,320
- Carl...
- I said it. I will think about it.

1432
01:10:42,364 --> 01:10:44,280
- Period.
- I live you, I respect that.

1433
01:10:44,324 --> 01:10:45,865
Thank you very much.

1434
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,328
Fucking rich people.
Parasites.

1435
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:51,913
You're in a mood.

1436
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,087
I gotta take this.

1437
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,361
Frank: <i>Well, I just
got off the phone</i>

1438
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:04,926
<i>with that cocksucker at Kingate.</i>

1439
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,970
He's pulling out 260 million.

1440
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,721
Do these fucking people
not understand

1441
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,932
how a fucking
split-strike works?

1442
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,703
- Do they not understand?
- <i>Hold on, I got Fairfield calling me back.</i>

1443
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,143
Hold on.

1444
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,187
Yeah?

1445
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:21,943
Hey, Rick Jarvis.

1446
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:23,547
We met at the club a few
months back with Solomon.

1447
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,947
Well, look, while I got
your attention,

1448
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:29,909
I just exited this private equity
venture with a five X return.

1449
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,954
I'm looking to put that money to
work right away this quarter.

1450
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:36,124
Well, unfortunately,
that's not possible.

1451
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:37,875
I haven't told you how much.

1452
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,337
- Well, it really doesn't matter.
- $100 million.

1453
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:43,214
I'm sorry, but the fund

1454
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:45,258
is fully subscribed
for the quarter.

1455
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,845
- Even in this market?
- My clients know not to worry.

1456
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:50,221
I know how to avoid
the pitfalls.

1457
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:53,891
Okay, I want in
this quarter, all right?

1458
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:55,727
Whatever restrictions
you wanna put on it,

1459
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,230
you know, I'll park this money
with you for a long time.

1460
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:01,544
It's not about the money. It's
about pushing clients aside.

1461
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:04,694
I can't do that.
I have to sacrifice someone,

1462
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:08,031
a loyal client to me,
in order to accommodate you.

1463
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,283
Unless it's really,
really worth it...

1464
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,118
I am talking about giving you

1465
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:13,995
$100 million.

1466
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,997
That's, uh, not gonna do it.

1467
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:19,792
So what's it gonna take?

1468
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,627
I have to do what's ethical.

1469
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,964
- I can't let you jump the line.
- I'll go 150 if you let me.

1470
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:27,633
- Love to help you, but I can't.
- <i>175.</i>

1471
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,386
Fully subscribed.

1472
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:32,346
- 200.
- <i>I wish I could.</i>

1473
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,766
I'm just thinking
if I... no.

1474
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,350
225?

1475
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:40,063
<i>250.</i>

1476
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,314
275.

1477
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,776
<i>$300 million.</i>

1478
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,696
How far do we gotta go?
Just tell me.

1479
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,783
If you go above four,
we might have something.

1480
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:52,992
<i>400.</i>

1481
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,837
I can do that.

1482
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:06,672
We got a deal.

1483
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:11,344
I gotta take this phone call.

1484
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,929
Yeah?

1485
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,867
I don't know who the fuck
I was just talking with,

1486
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,611
but if this guy checks out, we just
picked up a good piece of change.

1487
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:20,561
Well, the shit is definitely
hitting the fucking fan.

1488
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,146
I got Fairfield-Greenwich
on the line.

1489
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:23,940
- You want me to patch you in?
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

1490
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,526
Man:<i> Hey, Bernie. We
catching you at a bad time?</i>

1491
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,861
You tell me. I got a back spasm
that's fucking killing me.

1492
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,863
- Man ♪2:<i> Bernie. Bernie.</i>
- What's going on?

1493
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,259
- Can I just get one minute?
- Not...

1494
01:13:32,283 --> 01:13:33,511
Just one minute
to introduce you.

1495
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:34,909
- I can't talk.
- <i>Just one minute!</i>

1496
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:37,245
- Yeah?
- Man:<i> Look, Bern,</i>

1497
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,831
<i>you're basically the only fund
that hasn't gotten hammered.</i>

1498
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:42,083
<i>You're the one place clients
can turn to for liquidity</i>

1499
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:43,793
<i>without taking huge losses.</i>

1500
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:45,419
<i>It's the winner's curse.</i>

1501
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,005
What... what, am I
supposed to be flattered

1502
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:50,152
that you just cashed out
a billion and a half dollars?

1503
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:52,093
You gotta put a stop
to these redemptions

1504
01:13:52,137 --> 01:13:53,823
because if you don't, just know
there's plenty of money out there

1505
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:55,972
that would love
to take your place.

1506
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:59,517
- <i>Is that a threat?</i>
- You can take it any way you like.

1507
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:03,229
Look at you all dressed
up and no place to die.

1508
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:06,149
- Hello, Jeffry. - Come on, Bernie,
there's no need for stress.

1509
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,401
I haven't made many withdrawals.

1510
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:14,198
Although, that's probably
something we should discuss, hmm?

1511
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:17,243
I did wanna tell you that there
are some real opportunities

1512
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:19,745
in the market right now
if you're interested, Jeffry.

1513
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:20,997
- Hmm.
- What do you think?

1514
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,082
- We should be talking...
- Mrs. Madoff!

1515
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:25,751
- <i>Mr. Picower.</i>
- Your husband doesn't look well.

1516
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:28,462
You should attend to him, hmm?

1517
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:32,175
You okay?

1518
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:34,093
What's wrong with him, Picower?

1519
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:37,096
He's one strange, sicko fuck.

1520
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,806
Oh, by the way, my sister,

1521
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,391
she's worried about the economy

1522
01:14:40,435 --> 01:14:41,851
and she was thinking
about investing

1523
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:43,394
the rest of her
savings with you.

1524
01:14:43,438 --> 01:14:45,438
- Would that be okay?
- Yeah, sure.

1525
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:10,213
Walter, I'm not a fucking money
market fund, do you understand?

1526
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,797
If you don't stop
these withdrawals

1527
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,527
and replace the money
before the end of the month,

1528
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:15,384
then I'm gonna cut you off!

1529
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,364
I'm gonna close the whole
fucking Fairfield account!

1530
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,804
Yes!

1531
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,806
Do you hear me?!

1532
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:27,813
Oh, shit.
What the...?

1533
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:34,757
- Ruth: I hated that. No, I didn't!
- Mark:<i> You loved it.</i>

1534
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:36,550
- <i>You came out of there, you said...
don't lie.</i> - Oh, I did not!

1535
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,407
- You're such a liar.
- <i>You're a liar.</i>

1536
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,534
Sweetheart, is that
a little bit too rare?

1537
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,119
Girl:
<i>This is good.</i>

1538
01:15:42,163 --> 01:15:44,372
- Everything all right?
- Bernie:<i> Yeah.</i>

1539
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:49,627
Did you wheel your luggage
into the bedroom?

1540
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:52,713
- Why?
- Did you wheel your luggage into the bedroom?

1541
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:56,842
Well, I certainly didn't bring
it in through the window.

1542
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,803
But you smudged the wall
by the door.

1543
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,471
You scuffed it
with your roller bag.

1544
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:04,475
Well, string me up
and feed me to the dogs.

1545
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:09,689
I'm sorry I scuffed
a wall, Bernie.

1546
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,734
Andy: <i>Emily, was just asking
about Wall Street, Dad.</i>

1547
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,862
Yeah,

1548
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,196
how is Wall Street, Papa?

1549
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,572
She's working on her MBA.

1550
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:21,242
Dad, future head
of Madoff Securities.

1551
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:22,827
Ruth: <i>That's right.
Watch out, guys.</i>

1552
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,163
I asked how's Wall Street, Papa?

1553
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,166
Wall Street is good.

1554
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,002
Dad says things
are bad at Wall Street.

1555
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,004
Well, Dad told you that,
but things are fine.

1556
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,214
<i>Why are they bad?</i>

1557
01:16:35,258 --> 01:16:36,841
What did I just say?

1558
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,552
Emily: <i>I asked a question.
Why is it bad?</i>

1559
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,012
I told you they're not bad.

1560
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,972
Why don't you just eat?

1561
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:45,933
Well, if it's not bad, why
do they call it a meltdown?

1562
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:50,604
- Why don't you tell me?
- <i>How am I supposed to know?</i>

1563
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,626
- <i>That's why I'm asking you.</i>
- Do you read "Barron's," huh?

1564
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,317
Do you read
the "Wall Street Journal"?

1565
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,736
- Why don't you tell me?
- I just asked a question.

1566
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,155
<i>You are my granddaughter
and you're an eight-year-old</i>

1567
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:01,490
and you shouldn't be asking
me questions like that.

1568
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,637
- I don't feel like talking about Wall Street.
- Andy:<i> Hey, Dad.</i>

1569
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,764
- I don't feel like... be talking
about Wall Street. - Dad.

1570
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,933
- <i>I'm here having dinner with my family.</i>
- That's enough.

1571
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:09,810
Ruth: <i>Bernie, what's wrong with you?
She's just curious.</i>

1572
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,812
Because she doesn't know what
the hell she's talking about.

1573
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:14,670
She's eight years old. I gotta
get grilled by this kid.

1574
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:16,483
- Why are you being so mean?
- <i>I got so many other goddamn things</i>

1575
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:18,674
I'm worried about on Wall Street

1576
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,718
and this kid's asking me
about how Wall Street is!

1577
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:22,845
- Shut up and eat your food!
- Andy:<i> Dad!</i>

1578
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,889
It's okay, sweetheart.
Bernie, stop it!

1579
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:26,849
What's wrong with you?

1580
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:28,768
Now you're playing the good guy.

1581
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,978
- <i>Honey, it's okay, it's okay.</i>
- Taking her side.

1582
01:17:31,022 --> 01:17:33,064
- She's just curious.
- <i>Now I can't eat.</i>

1583
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:34,793
- It's okay, it's okay.
- She's an eight-year-old kid.

1584
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,609
What's the matter with you?

1585
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:39,445
Ruth:<i> You're just too smart.</i>

1586
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:42,156
Ruth:
<i>It's okay.</i>

1587
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:52,875
<i>I wanna know why
you're acting this way.</i>

1588
01:17:52,919 --> 01:17:55,628
The fucking market
is a bloodbath.

1589
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:02,134
- Ah! God damn it.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1590
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,761
Take it ea... Dad.

1591
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:05,388
Fucking thing.

1592
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,516
What's going on?
Are you all right?

1593
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,810
I started these
blood pressure pills.

1594
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,770
Makes me dizzy.

1595
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:15,314
- Maybe you should take a couple days off.
- <i>No, I can't.</i>

1596
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:18,275
I have to be at the office
first thing in the morning.

1597
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,862
- Founder of Home Depot.
- Reschedule.

1598
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:26,117
- You know...
- This fucking thing.

1599
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,744
If you ever trusted me

1600
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,621
to help you with the advisory,

1601
01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:32,790
you know, I could handle
this kind of thing for you.

1602
01:18:32,834 --> 01:18:35,251
It's my business, not yours.

1603
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:37,795
Well, what happens
when you're gone?

1604
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:40,192
- I'm not having this discussion with you.
- <i>It's a legitimate question.</i>

1605
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,027
- I'm not having this discussion with you.
- <i>What is it, Dad?</i>

1606
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,217
Tell me.
What is it?

1607
01:18:43,261 --> 01:18:44,844
Is it that I'm not cut out?

1608
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:48,556
- Are you not listening?
- Just be honest with me.

1609
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:51,142
- Just tell me.
- Do you not see what I have to deal with,

1610
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,436
the shit that I have to
go through on a daily basis?

1611
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,604
No, that's why...
that's my point.

1612
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,368
<i>The fucking shit
that they put me through?</i>

1613
01:18:57,400 --> 01:18:59,128
<i>That they're trying
to fuck me all the time?</i>

1614
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:01,652
Steal from me?
Do you think you can do that?

1615
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:03,529
Do you think
you can deal with that?

1616
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,134
- Yes, I can.
- <i>I don't think you can deal with it.</i>

1617
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:07,116
<i>Bullshit.
I don't think so.</i>

1618
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,243
You can't stomach that stuff.
That's not in you.

1619
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:11,412
Andy, maybe, but not you.

1620
01:19:11,456 --> 01:19:13,080
What?

1621
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:14,540
Wait, what are you saying?

1622
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:16,041
Are you saying that Andy...

1623
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,293
<i>what are you saying?</i>

1624
01:19:17,336 --> 01:19:19,587
Andy's better
at his job than I am?

1625
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,339
- <i>Mark.</i> - I go to that fucking
office every single day.

1626
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:24,008
I do the same thing
that he does.

1627
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:26,802
I gave you
a fucking business to run.

1628
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,304
Are you not happy with that?

1629
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,847
<i>Was that not good enough
for you?</i>

1630
01:19:29,891 --> 01:19:32,600
It is definitely
good enough for me, Dad.

1631
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,037
- <i>I'm just trying...</i>
- Well, then shut the fuck up

1632
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,686
and give me
a little fucking gratitude.

1633
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:40,774
Say, "I'm... thanks, Dad."
Can't you do that?

1634
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:42,963
<i>What, do you think the whole
fucking world owes you something?</i>

1635
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:44,945
The whole fucking world
owes you nothing.

1636
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:47,134
You gotta work for it, and I
always say this with your mother.

1637
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:50,409
<i>This is the problem with
having money, an education.</i>

1638
01:19:50,453 --> 01:19:52,077
Nothing is earned.

1639
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,788
You want something,
you gotta fucking work for it.

1640
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,462
What, you don't think I have?

1641
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:31,116
For you, it was
installing sprinklers.

1642
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,286
For me, it was digging ditches
on a construction crew.

1643
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:38,249
I never would have started Home Depot
if I hadn't had that experience.

1644
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,125
Ken, I wanna be
respectful of your time,

1645
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,669
so I'm gonna get right to it.

1646
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:44,046
I'm starting a new
highly exclusive fund.

1647
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,881
It's gonna have
just five investors.

1648
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:47,675
Same split-strike
conversion strategy

1649
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:50,094
that's performed
so consistently.

1650
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:52,012
But, frankly,

1651
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:54,306
this fund's gonna have
even higher returns.

1652
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:55,933
The only thing is that it relies

1653
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:57,788
on the market volatility
that we're seeing now,

1654
01:20:57,812 --> 01:21:00,604
so I gotta put the money
together right away.

1655
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:02,709
Your current fund's been running
for a while, hasn't it?

1656
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,358
It has.
Decades.

1657
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:06,110
Double digit returns every year.

1658
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,571
And you're promising even better
returns for the new fund?

1659
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,239
It's a unique opportunity, Ken.

1660
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:11,907
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1661
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,076
<i>So I'm asking myself
only one question.</i>

1662
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,163
What if I'm a longtime
client of yours

1663
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:21,041
and, uh, how would I feel

1664
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:23,085
getting shafted
for new customers?

1665
01:21:23,129 --> 01:21:26,505
There are other people
that I do other funds with,

1666
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,860
but I don't wanna include them
in this because they're not...

1667
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,302
- Whoa, whoa, wait a second.
- they're not the ones...

1668
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:33,387
Okay, just a second.
I'm a little confused.

1669
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:35,598
You got this fund,
you got that fund,

1670
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,578
you got people who are long-term
customers and you're not gonna...

1671
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:39,079
Those people are already
taken care of.

1672
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,020
We have... we have
other funds with them.

1673
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:43,125
Bernie, I don't... I don't know
what you're trying to say.

1674
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,024
- <i>Well...</i>
- I'm confused.

1675
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,735
<i>The new fund is getting money
before the other people?</i>

1676
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,613
- That's not what I'm saying.
- <i>That's exactly what you're saying.</i>

1677
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:53,115
I'm not saying that.
They are taken care of.

1678
01:21:53,159 --> 01:21:55,117
I have other
arrangements with them.

1679
01:21:55,161 --> 01:21:56,744
<i>Something is not kosher here.</i>

1680
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,495
- <i>Something.</i>
- No, it's all kosher.

1681
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,831
I think it's not kosher.
I think it's total bullshit.

1682
01:22:00,875 --> 01:22:02,249
That's what I think.

1683
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:03,959
It's hitting me the wrong way.

1684
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:06,170
Something is wrong here.

1685
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:09,548
I think you're full of shit,
that's what I think.

1686
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,342
I'm getting
the hell out of here.

1687
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,396
Is that guy in?

1688
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:27,066
You're kidding me.

1689
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:32,446
All right, well,
between Medici, Kingate,

1690
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,490
and the fucking Spaniards,

1691
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:38,202
that's minus
1.5 billion right there.

1692
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:42,956
Thanks to Fairfield,
we're down 980 in November

1693
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,878
and we're looking at at least
minus 580 in December, Bern.

1694
01:22:47,922 --> 01:22:50,589
We write that fucking check,
it's gonna bounce.

1695
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,758
We got 300 million left.

1696
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:54,343
What do you wanna do?

1697
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:56,470
Hey, Carl, this is great news.

1698
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:58,555
I just want you to know
it's great news.

1699
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:01,058
- <i>All right, take care.</i>
- Okay, of course, of course.

1700
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:02,643
- Great. Okay, talk soon.
- <i>That's it.</i>

1701
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,269
- Thank you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1702
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:05,854
He's in for 250.

1703
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:08,315
All right.
That's not nothin'.

1704
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:09,817
<i>No, but it's not enough.</i>

1705
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:12,319
No, it's definitely not enough.

1706
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:13,882
What about that schmuck
from Palm Beach?

1707
01:23:13,906 --> 01:23:15,447
Oh, no, no, no, it was, like,

1708
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:16,843
20 fucking questions
with that guy.

1709
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,575
He wanted to know
why our controller

1710
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:20,411
was based in Bermuda.

1711
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:23,080
Why our auditor
was a one-man operation

1712
01:23:23,124 --> 01:23:25,457
working out of a strip mall
in upstate New York.

1713
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,626
It was a whole fucking
thing with that guy.

1714
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:33,799
Andy: <i>It's not an
easy conversation.</i>

1715
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:35,737
Catherine: <i>I've already laid
the groundwork for this.</i>

1716
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,803
<i>You're hardly
in the office anymore.</i>

1717
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:39,972
I think what I say is that...

1718
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,724
Andrew, sweetheart,

1719
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,245
you don't have to sell him
on a decision

1720
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:44,935
that you're making for yourself.

1721
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:47,604
- <i>This is about you.</i>
- I know, I know.

1722
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,982
It's just hard because I know
he's gonna be disappointed.

1723
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,192
Well, I'm not.

1724
01:23:52,236 --> 01:23:54,486
I am very proud of you.

1725
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:57,030
<i>Thanks.</i>

1726
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,491
Andy's voice: <i>Okay, I'll
see you when I get home.</i>

1727
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,993
<i>I love you.</i>

1728
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:04,788
Dad?

1729
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:06,290
You okay?
What's wrong?

1730
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,625
Oh, fucking back spasms.
It's all seized up.

1731
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,794
This is the only position
that doesn't kill.

1732
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,713
I'm sorry. Can I
get you something?

1733
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:14,548
I already took a bunch of pills.

1734
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:16,884
- <i>What's up?</i>
- Uh, nothing.

1735
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,136
- We can talk later.
- <i>Look, what do you need?</i>

1736
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,345
No, forget it.

1737
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,973
Well, fucking spit it out.

1738
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:24,578
Well, I wanna talk to you
about a few things.

1739
01:24:24,602 --> 01:24:27,144
<i>Then spit it out.
Come on.</i>

1740
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:31,523
Well...
well, look...

1741
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:34,026
I'm thinking about taking
office space somewhere else.

1742
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,113
You're thinking about
leaving the business?

1743
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:40,699
I'm ready to strike out
on my own.

1744
01:24:40,743 --> 01:24:44,411
And here I was worried about
the business I handed you.

1745
01:24:44,455 --> 01:24:47,080
Look, I have professional
goals of my own.

1746
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:49,166
And I'd like to run
my own company someday

1747
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:51,021
and it's obviously not
happening here anytime soon.

1748
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:52,920
<i>You're pretty
fucking selfish, Andrew.</i>

1749
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:54,755
You got some fucking nerve.

1750
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:57,674
I've worked here forever
and I'm still not a partner.

1751
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:00,260
It's your name on the doors,
as you love to say.

1752
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:02,679
You obviously can't see how
selfish you're being right now.

1753
01:25:02,723 --> 01:25:04,951
Let me ask you something,
do you know what kind of offers

1754
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,308
I've gotten to sell this firm?

1755
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,018
- <i>Do you?</i>
- No, I don't.

1756
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:10,729
The last one was from Goldman
for a billion dollars.

1757
01:25:10,773 --> 01:25:12,648
What?
Why didn't you take it?

1758
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,399
<i>Because I didn't wanna take it.</i>

1759
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,046
<i>I need it like I need
a fucking hole in the head.</i>

1760
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,486
And the main reason
I didn't take it

1761
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:19,029
is because of you boys,
that's why.

1762
01:25:19,073 --> 01:25:20,633
Because one day,
I want this to be yours

1763
01:25:20,658 --> 01:25:22,199
with your name on the door.

1764
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,745
<i>I mean, why else
would you think I'd do it?</i>

1765
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,582
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1766
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:35,587
- You're welcome.
- Yeah, I heard you.

1767
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:47,599
Reporter: <i>Bernie, how far...
does your wife know?</i>

1768
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:50,769
<i>Bernie, does your wife know?</i>

1769

1780
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:14,251
- <i>for what may be his last
night of comfort in...</i> - Hey.

1781
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:15,961
What is it?

1782
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:18,005
I don't know, maybe
it's a waste of time,

1783
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,549
but I thought that I
would try to write.

1784
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:23,343
Write what?

1785
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:24,803
<i>I don't know, a book.</i>

1786
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,182
Ah, it sounds stupid.

1787
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:32,436
No, it doesn't sound stupid.

1788
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:36,523
It may not be any good,
but I... I, um...

1789
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:38,775
this is just the opening.

1790
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,529
<i>Do you wanna hear it?</i>

1791
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:44,197
Yeah, I'd love to hear it.

1792
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,540
"Up until December 10th, 2008,

1793
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:55,542
I spent the entirety of my life

1794
01:26:55,586 --> 01:26:58,170
in awe of my father.

1795
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,130
I judged every accomplishment,

1796
01:27:00,174 --> 01:27:03,258
every failure, professionally
or personally,

1797
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:04,676
against the life he lived.

1798
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,511
<i>His approval meant everything,</i>

1799
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,013
<i>maybe too much,</i>

1800
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:09,848
<i>and for as long
as I can remember,</i>

1801
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:12,976
<i>I worked as hard as I could
to make him proud.</i>

1802
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,020
<i>And then one day,</i>

1803
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:18,023
<i>I found out that my father
was not the man I thought.</i>

1804
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:21,902
He was a criminal,
a man I didn't respect.

1805
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:24,363
And yet this man, my father,

1806
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:27,991
is the same man who taught
me right from wrong,

1807
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:30,619
taught me to be fair
and decent and honest,

1808
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,246
taught me about the
importance of character,

1809
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:36,333
what it means to be a husband,

1810
01:27:36,377 --> 01:27:40,379
<i>and, most importantly,
how to be a father.</i>

1811
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,550
<i>I am the son of Bernie Madoff.</i>

1812
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,929
I used to think that I
could never escape that.

1813
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:51,014
Now I'm certain I won't.

1814
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,685
Why is it so hard to believe

1815
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,873
that those closest to him
wouldn't see him as a criminal?

1816
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:59,189
Why is it so hard
to believe that his son

1817
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:02,776
would think his father
could do no wrong?

1818
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:06,196
<i>When I look
at my youngest son, Nick,</i>

1819
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,074
<i>I fear the day
when he's old enough to ask</i>

1820
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:12,077
<i>what his grandfather was like.</i>

1821
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:13,954
<i>What kind of man was he?</i>

1822
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:18,125
If I tell him he was evil,

1823
01:28:18,168 --> 01:28:21,753
how can I explain that I'm"...

1824
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,385
"that I"...

1825
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,060
It's good, Mark.

1826
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,814
<i>It's really good.</i>

1827
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:42,607
Yeah, I... I don't know.

1828
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,120
Catherine:
<i>So, is it a plea deal?</i>

1829
01:28:55,164 --> 01:28:57,205
Martin: <i>No.
He's just pleading guilty.</i>

1830
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:58,874
Mark: <i>So, he's just
gonna plead guilty</i>

1831
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:00,792
<i>to all the charges
and that's it?</i>

1832
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,085
It looks that way.

1833
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:04,046
- So there will be no trial?
- No.

1834
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,882
Mark:<i> Have you read what
they're saying about us?</i>

1835
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:10,177
Every fucking day they're
calling for our head...

1836
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,637
<i>every paper, every blog.</i>

1837
01:29:12,681 --> 01:29:14,200
<i>How are those people
gonna know we're innocent</i>

1838
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:15,932
<i>if there's no trial?
How?!</i>

1839
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:18,268
- How?
- The sooner he is locked up...

1840
01:29:18,312 --> 01:29:19,686
- Bullshit.
- This will be over.

1841
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:21,563
It's gonna fucking linger.

1842
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:23,607
The questions, the suspicions,

1843
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,776
the fucking paparazzi
camped out...

1844
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,694
Are they not charging him
with conspiracy?

1845
01:29:27,738 --> 01:29:30,363
No, he won't plead guilty
to conspiracy.

1846
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:32,385
Reporter:<i> Mr. Madoff, are
you going to plead guilty?</i>

1847
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,659
Mark: <i>They should charge him
anyway and force a trial.</i>

1848
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,870
Andy: <i>If they took Dad to
trial, what would happen?</i>

1849
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,538
<i>Just think about it, Mark.</i>

1850
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,665
<i>You're talking
about putting the richest</i>

1851
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:43,335
<i>and most powerful people
in the world up on that stand.</i>

1852
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:46,755
You're talking about JP Morgan,

1853
01:29:46,799 --> 01:29:50,675
Chase, HSBC, Swiss Banks.

1854
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,679
You're talking about the world's
financial system on trial.

1855
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:57,265
Now, I'm not
a conspiracy theorist,

1856
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,476
but trust me,
that will never happen.

1857
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,894
Ever.

1858
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:02,813
So, no,

1859
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:04,189
there won't be a trial.

1860
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:06,316
The public won't know the truth.

1861
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,236
And we'll be left
to fend for ourselves.

1862
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,696
Stephanie:
<i>I don't understand, Mark.</i>

1863
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:13,782
<i>Do you want a trial?</i>

1864
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:14,991
No.

1865
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,619
Well, what do you want?

1866
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:21,540
I want my life back.

1867
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,027
Stephanie's voice: <i>We're not here.
Leave a message.</i>

1868
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:33,343
Mom again.

1869
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:36,680
Ruth: <i>Hi, it's me again.</i>

1870
01:30:36,723 --> 01:30:38,765
Your mother.

1871
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:42,769
I don't know why I'm calling.

1872
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:47,816
<i>I feel like such a moron</i>

1873
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,901
<i>leaving all these messages,</i>

1874
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:51,736
<i>begging you.</i>

1875
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:54,114
<i>I don't know.</i>

1876
01:30:55,784 --> 01:30:57,492
I miss you.

1877
01:30:57,536 --> 01:31:00,120
I miss Stephanie, I miss Audrey.

1878
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:03,832
<i>I haven't even seen little Nick.</i>

1879
01:31:03,876 --> 01:31:07,210
<i>I haven't even seen my grandson.</i>

1880
01:31:07,254 --> 01:31:09,713
<i>What am I supposed to do, Mark?</i>

1881
01:31:09,756 --> 01:31:13,049
<i>I'm stuck.</i>

1882
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,719
<i>I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for what he did.</i>

1883
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:17,304
<i>I don't know
what he was thinking.</i>

1884
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,097
<i>I can't even fathom it.</i>

1885
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:23,059
I just don't understand
why you're so angry at me.

1886
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,187
I know you want me to leave him,

1887
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,147
but I can't just abandon him.

1888
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:29,608
How am I supposed to
just walk out

1889
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,610
of a 50-year marriage?

1890
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:34,487
He's my lifetime.

1891
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,866
He's my whole, entire memory.

1892
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:41,828
<i>I don't know anything else.</i>

1893
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,955
<i>I've never been on my own.</i>

1894
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:48,919
I'm not as brave as you two.

1895
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:54,299
Call me.

1896
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,891
Judge: <i>How do you now
plead to count one...</i>

1897
01:32:02,935 --> 01:32:05,852
<i>the charge of securities fraud,</i>

1898
01:32:05,896 --> 01:32:07,437
<i>guilty or not guilty?</i>

1899
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:08,897
Guilty.

1900
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:11,107
<i>How do you plead to count two...</i>

1901
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:14,277
<i>the charge of investment
advisory fraud,</i>

1902
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:15,487
<i>guilty or not guilty?</i>

1903
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:17,906
Guilty.

1904
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:19,991
<i>How do you now plead
to count three...</i>

1905
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:21,868
<i>the charge of mail fraud?</i>

1906
01:32:21,912 --> 01:32:23,370
<i>guilty or not guilty?</i>

1907
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:25,372
Guilty.

1908
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:28,166
- <i>How do you now plead to count four?</i>
- Guilty.

1909
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:31,336
- <i>How do you now plead to count five?</i>
- Guilty.

1910
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,506
- <i>How do you now plead to count six?</i>
- Guilty.

1911
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,634
- <i>How do you now plead to count seven?</i>
- Guilty.

1912
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:40,512
- <i>How do you now plead to count eight?</i>
- Guilty.

1913
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:43,390
- <i>How do you now plead to count nine?</i>
- Guilty.

1914
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:46,643
Guilty.

1915
01:32:48,522 --> 01:32:49,896
Guilty.

1916
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:55,402
As Mr. Madoff
has pled guilty,

1917
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,155
he is no longer entitled to
the presumption of innocence.

1918
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,575
In light of his age,
he has incentive to flee.

1919
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:04,911
<i>He has the means to flee</i>

1920
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:06,955
<i>and thus, bail is revoked</i>

1921
01:33:06,999 --> 01:33:09,541
and the defendant is remanded.

1922
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:11,918
Your Honor, would Your Honor
consider, respectfully,

1923
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:13,231
a stay so that
we might appeal...

1924
01:33:13,255 --> 01:33:15,630
<i>Your request
for a stay is denied.</i>

1925
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:18,300
<i>Mr. Madoff, I will see
you at sentencing.</i>

1926
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,260
- Sorry, Bernie.
- <i>We are adjourned.</i>

1927
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:25,473
Man: <i>If you are
visiting an inmate</i>

1928
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:26,808
<i>in the maximum security wing,</i>

1929
01:33:26,852 --> 01:33:29,728
form a single-file line
to your right.

1930
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,292
Stop here.

1931
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:53,918
Keys.

1932
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:03,428
Turn around.

1933
01:34:04,806 --> 01:34:06,097
Open your legs.

1934
01:34:10,062 --> 01:34:12,582
Bernie's voice: <i>In the cell next
to me, they got this terrorist.</i>

1935
01:34:12,606 --> 01:34:14,206
<i>Some sheikh.
I can't remember his name.</i>

1936
01:34:14,232 --> 01:34:17,275
<i>But that's my neighbor.
Go figure.</i>

1937
01:34:17,319 --> 01:34:18,818
Ruth's voice:
<i>I don't understand</i>

1938
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:21,363
<i>why they put you
in maximum security.</i>

1939
01:34:25,369 --> 01:34:27,827
Did you finish packing up
the apartment?

1940
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,704
<i>There's not much left to pack.</i>

1941
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:31,790
<i>They're taking everything.</i>

1942
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,541
They even said to me,

1943
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:35,505
"We're gonna need your
underwear and nightgowns."

1944
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,505
- Who said that?
- US Marshals.

1945
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,215
What would they want
your underwear for?

1946
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,634
They're gonna sell it.
They're gonna auction it off.

1947
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,220
It's unbelievable.

1948
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:47,055
Nothing is off-limits
to these people.

1949
01:34:47,099 --> 01:34:48,515
<i>I don't even like
to think about it.</i>

1950
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:51,476
It's so spooky.

1951
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,104
<i>Have you spoken to the boys?</i>

1952
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,648
No one speaks to me

1953
01:34:56,691 --> 01:35:00,068
except my sister.

1954
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:03,405
Joan even offered to let me
come stay with her in Boca.

1955
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:05,615
- Well, she's your sister.
- Yeah, I know,

1956
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:09,828
but considering she and Bob
lost everything they had...

1957
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,497
It was all with you.

1958
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:14,999
I mean, it meant a lot to me.

1959
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,460
Yeah, that was unfortunate.

1960
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,587
That's why I was hoping
to have those few extra days

1961
01:35:19,631 --> 01:35:21,214
to make sure everyone
was taken care of.

1962
01:35:22,968 --> 01:35:26,886
I just feel like
such a total putz.

1963
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:30,890
I... I mean, when you don't
know what's going on,

1964
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,851
<i>you don't even know what to say.</i>

1965
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:37,021
I mean, how am I supposed to
explain the Cohmad withdrawals?

1966
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,690
You asked me to transfer money

1967
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,108
from one account to another.

1968
01:35:40,152 --> 01:35:42,610
I do it and a few hours later,

1969
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:45,655
you tell me
it's all a Ponzi scheme.

1970
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:47,657
<i>All these questions</i>

1971
01:35:47,701 --> 01:35:51,536
<i>and I don't have
any answers, Bernie.</i>

1972
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,079
Even if you had told me,

1973
01:35:53,123 --> 01:35:56,541
I'm not sure
I would've turned you in.

1974
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:00,712
I don't know
what that says about me.

1975
01:36:02,466 --> 01:36:04,841
That's the tragedy of it.

1976
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:10,054
Reporter: <i>Mr. Madoff, are you
scared you're gonna lose your home?</i>

1977
01:36:10,098 --> 01:36:12,599
<i>Mr. Madoff, what do you have
to say to all of the people...</i>

1978
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:14,745
- Please go away.
- Stephanie: <i>What the hell is wrong with you?!</i>

1979
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,729
- Please leave us alone.
- Stephanie:<i> Can you put the camera down?</i>

1980
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,314
Do you feel guilty?

1981
01:36:19,357 --> 01:36:20,877
Do you feel remorseful?

1982
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:22,609
<i>You feeling like you're scared?</i>

1983
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:24,777
Do you feel any responsibility?

1984
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,112
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

1985
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:27,572
What kind of person
chases a family?

1986
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,824
You don't have any right
to touch my personal...

1987
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:32,138
- <i>I could sue you for shoving me.</i>
- Oh, fuck you! Get in line.

1988
01:36:32,162 --> 01:36:34,704
<i>Do you enjoy this?
Do you enjoy...</i>

1989
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,877
Stephanie:
<i>I don't get it, Mark.</i>

1990
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:43,463
- I don't get it.
- What's there to get?

1991
01:36:43,507 --> 01:36:46,633
Your first instinct was to abandon us.
I don't get that.

1992
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:48,529
- I was waiting for you here...
- <i>You left his stroller</i>

1993
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,220
<i>in the middle
of the street, Mark.</i>

1994
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:51,574
- It was on the sidewalk.
- <i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1995
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:52,867
You just left me
to deal with everything.

1996
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:54,202
Do you understand
how unfair that is?

1997
01:36:54,226 --> 01:36:56,059
This is about me.
They want me.

1998
01:36:56,102 --> 01:36:58,436
- This isn't about you.
- No, this is about all of us.

1999
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,147
I... I am sick and tired
of you acting like it's not.

2000
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:04,108
- <i>You know...</i> - So what do you
want, Steph? You want a divorce?

2001
01:37:06,613 --> 01:37:08,780
Just some acknowledgement.

2002

How have you been, Reed?

2025
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,578
Well, after your father
fucked us all over,

2026
01:38:38,622 --> 01:38:41,080
things have been
fucking fantastic.

2027
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:42,790
Yeah, lots of job interviews.

2028

No one willing

Working at BLM for seven
years, I guess I'm tainted.

2030
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:50,298
Well, I know it's been

Reed, when I found out,
it was like my head exploded.

01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:04,979
- I just...
- Shh, you hear that?

2039
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:07,398
- What?
- It's the world's tiniest violin

<i>'Cause I was looking

2044
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:17,992
A lot of traders
were owed bonuses, Reed.

2045
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:20,536
You weren't the only one.
We all got screwed.

2046
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,372
I thought you were

Am I not family, Andy?

Come on,
where's the fucking money?

2049
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:27,835
What'd you do with the money?

2050
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,879
We all know you stole it.

2051
01:39:29,923 --> 01:39:31,150
Of course you took it.
You're a criminal!

2052
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:32,674
I got fucked over, too!

2053
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:35,218

My own father fucked me over!

Yeah, is that your whore?
I see you, whore!

2055

Hey!

Stop it!
Andy, get in the car.

Hey! Jesus,
get in the car.

2059
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:49,273
Jesus.

2060
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:54,487

Fuck you!

2063
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:01,586
I know you're in on it!

2064
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:04,288
Ugh.

2065
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:13,172
Morley Safer: <i>The question is
where did all the money go?</i>

2066
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,300
Irving Picard,
the court-appointed trustee,

2067

the liquidator,

2068

<i>and trying to recover

<i>from Madoff's remaining assets.</i>

2071
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,520
Of all the people
that should've known,

2072
01:40:27,564 --> 01:40:29,564
his brother and his sons,

2073
01:40:29,607 --> 01:40:31,691
who worked under
the same roof with him,

2074
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:33,484
<i>should've known.</i>

2075
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:35,987
- One would think so, yes.
- Morley:<i> Did they know?</i>

2076
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,448
David Sheehan: <i>My belief
is, yes, they knew.</i>

2077
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:43,619
Clearly, they would have to
have known what was going on

2078
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,914
- <i>given their own personal transactions...</i>
- Mark: Oh, we should've known?

2079
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,958
We worked for market making.

2080
01:40:49,002 --> 01:40:51,919
He worked for IA.

2081
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,316
- How would we have known? 
- Morley: <i>If they turn out to be untouchable,</i>

2082
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:58,176
<i>criminally, do you intend
to bankrupt them civilly?</i>

2083
01:40:58,219 --> 01:41:00,303
Irving: <i>Whether or not they
have a criminal problem,</i>

2084
01:41:00,346 --> 01:41:03,765
<i>we will pursue them
as far as we can pursue them.</i>

2085
01:41:03,808 --> 01:41:06,100
And if that leads
to bankrupting them,

2086
01:41:06,144 --> 01:41:08,561
then that's what will happen.

2087
01:41:14,277 --> 01:41:17,779
Woman: <i>The man sitting in
this courtroom robbed me.</i>

2088
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:20,823
He discarded me like roadkill.

2089
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:24,911
What can we possibly
say good about Madoff

2090
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,122
when he sank so low

2091
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:31,250
as to steal from Elie Wiesel

2092
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:34,879
as if Wiesel hasn't already
suffered enough in his lifetime.

2093
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:38,925
My wife and I
are not millionaires.

2094
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:41,803
<i>We worked hard for all our lives</i>

2095
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:45,056
and he took
our entire life savings.

2096
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:48,893
Mr. Madoff not only defrauded
thousands of investors,

2097
01:41:48,937 --> 01:41:52,772
he mastered the art of
manipulating our government.

2098
01:41:52,816 --> 01:41:55,149
The money Madoff stole
from my family

2099
01:41:55,193 --> 01:41:58,444
had been set aside
to take care of my brother

2100
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,364
because he's gonna need medical
assistance for the rest of his life.

2101
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:04,992
If he's attempting
to protect his family,

2102
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,286
he should not be given
the opportunity

2103
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,831
<i>because we, his victims,</i>

2104
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:11,958
<i>did not have
the same opportunity</i>

2105
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:14,085
<i>to protect our families.</i>

2106
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:18,297
Man: <i>You have left your family
with a legacy of shame.</i>

2107
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,258
<i>You have a marriage
made in hell,</i>

2108
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:24,303
<i>and that is where
you are going to return.</i>

2109
01:42:24,347 --> 01:42:27,056
Man ♪2:<i> I only hope his prison
sentence is long enough</i>

2110
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,684
<i>that his jail cell
becomes his coffin.</i>

2111
01:42:29,727 --> 01:42:32,770
Man:
<i>May God spare you no mercy.</i>

2112
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:34,355
Bernie's voice:
<i>I am responsible</i>

2113
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:36,941
<i>for a great deal
of suffering and pain.</i>

2114
01:42:36,985 --> 01:42:39,151
<i>I understand that.</i>

2115
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:41,195
<i>I live in a tormented state</i>

2116
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:43,155
<i>now knowing of all the pain

<i>that I have created.</i>

2118
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:46,701
<i>That's something
I will live with</i>

2119
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,327
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

2120
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,122
People have accused me
of being silent

2121
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:52,957
and not being sympathetic.

2122
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:55,376
That is not true.

2123
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,795
I apologize to my victims.

2124
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:02,341
I will turn and face you.

2125
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:18,649
I'm sorry.

2126
01:43:22,322 --> 01:43:24,447
I know that doesn't help.

2127
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:28,451
Your Honor,

2128
01:43:28,494 --> 01:43:30,161
thank you for listening.

2129
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:34,165

<i>that Mr. Madoff's crimes</i>

2131
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,002
<i>were extraordinarily evil.</i>

2132
01:43:38,046 --> 01:43:41,631
<i>This kind of irresponsible
manipulation of the system</i>

2133
01:43:41,674 --> 01:43:44,550
<i>takes a staggering human toll.</i>

2134
01:43:44,594 --> 01:43:47,637
Mr. Madoff will get
what he deserves

2135
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,430
and will be punished

2136
01:43:49,474 --> 01:43:53,267
according to
his moral culpabilities.

2137

<i>Mr. Madoff,
please stand.</i>

01:43:56,606 --> 01:43:58,606
<i>It is the judgment of this court</i>

2139
01:43:58,650 --> 01:44:01,525

Bernard L. Madoff,</i>

2140
01:44:01,569 --> 01:44:04,320

- Woman:<i> Yes!</i>

2143

Where's our money?!

2144
01:44:22,298 --> 01:44:23,965
As a technical matter,

2145
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:26,509
the sentence
must be expressed in months.

2146
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:29,220
<i>150 years is equivalent</i>

2147

2148

I'm in Florida.

2163
01:45:50,303 --> 01:45:51,719
Very much in love

2164
01:45:51,763 --> 01:45:53,763
just like Bonnie was
to Clyde, Charlie.

2165
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:56,599
Bonnie robbed banks.
Bonnie killed people.

2174
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:18,913
How I was able to do that

01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:20,706
and maintain
any degree of sanity,

2176
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,875
well, that... that worries
me when I think about it.

2177
01:46:22,919 --> 01:46:24,835
You already mentioned that.

2178
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,274
Yeah, I did.

2179
01:46:27,298 --> 01:46:29,757
But while we're on the subject,

2180
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:31,967
you say you wanted
to protect your family.

2181
01:46:32,011 --> 01:46:33,803
<i>Right.</i>

2182
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:35,638
But just an example,

2183
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:37,223
<i>what would have happened</i>

2184
01:46:37,266 --> 01:46:40,893

<i>you'd been hit by a bus,
you'd drop dead?</i>

2186
01:46:43,606 --> 01:46:46,232
Mark and Andrew
would've become the owners

2187
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:49,527
of a firm that was
still in the middle

2188
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:52,905
of perpetrating the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history.

2189
01:46:52,949 --> 01:46:55,908
Except the advisory was a
completely separate business,

2190
01:46:55,952 --> 01:46:58,452
one in which they had
no involvement, so...

2191
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,412
But with you dead

2192
01:47:00,456 --> 01:47:02,123
and Frank probably willing

2193
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:04,416
to swear to anything
to save himself,

2194
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,418
<i>seems to me the odds are</i>

2195
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:09,547
<i>that as owners
as lifelong executives,</i>

2196
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,215
they'd have gone to jail.

2197
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:13,592
Your sons would be sitting
there where you are.

2198
01:47:13,636 --> 01:47:16,220
No, well, I protected them.

2199
01:47:16,264 --> 01:47:20,099
<i>You couldn't have protected
them if you were dead, Bernie.</i>

2200
01:47:20,143 --> 01:47:22,184
<i>So who would've
been held responsible?</i>

2201
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:23,727
I would've been.

2202
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:25,688
<i>They would've been, Bernie.</i>

2203
01:47:25,731 --> 01:47:28,983
<i>They would've
been held responsible,</i>

2204
01:47:29,026 --> 01:47:32,403
which means
one of two things is true.

2205
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:35,114
Either they actually were guilty

2206
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:37,741
and accepted the risks

2207
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:41,579
<i>or you were willing
to let your sons go to jail</i>

2208
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,581
<i>for the crime you committed.</i>

2209
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:46,792
<i>Which is it, Bernie?</i>

2210
01:47:46,836 --> 01:47:49,503
I do like jousting with you.

2211
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:51,255
I'm not jousting
with you, Bernie.

2212
01:47:51,299 --> 01:47:53,424
- Yeah, well...
- I'm not jousting with you.

2213
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:56,594
It seems to me like...

2214
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:05,102
like you're refusing

2215
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:09,148
to recognize that hazard

2216
01:48:09,192 --> 01:48:11,525
you created for your family.

2217
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:13,235
Not just the day
you were arrested,

2218
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:15,571
but the hazard
that they lived under,

2219
01:48:15,615 --> 01:48:20,034
unknowing, for,
well, however long

2220
01:48:20,077 --> 01:48:21,869
you were operating this fraud.

2221
01:48:21,913 --> 01:48:25,122
Eventually,
they would be exonerated.

2222
01:48:25,166 --> 01:48:27,269
- Period. - <i>How could you
have been so certain of that,</i>

2223
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:28,751
<i>that you were
willing to risk it?</i>

2224
01:48:28,794 --> 01:48:30,794
Because they were
never involved, ever,

2225
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:33,297
and there's no way it's ever
gonna be proven otherwise.

2226
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:37,384
So it doesn't matter.

2227
01:48:37,428 --> 01:48:39,072
It's a terrible thing
that they're going through,

2228
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:42,097
but they never
would have been convicted

2229
01:48:42,141 --> 01:48:43,724
because they couldn't
be convicted.

2230
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:46,435
Because they didn't do anything.

2231
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:48,395
Neither did my wife.

2232
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:52,483
Nothing. Zero.

2233
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:55,819
- <i>But you know what you've done...</i>
- I know what I've done.

2234
01:48:55,863 --> 01:48:58,614
- <i>Has shattered your family.</i>
- I take full responsibility for that

2235
01:48:58,658 --> 01:49:02,910
and it'll... it'll kill me
for the rest of my life.

2236
01:49:02,954 --> 01:49:04,662
But...

01:51:47,326 --> 01:51:49,410
<i>I sent you the article.
Did you get it?</i>

2283
01:51:49,453 --> 01:51:52,037
<i>Anyway, please give me
a call back.</i>

2284
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:54,164
Hey, man, it's me.

2285
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:56,208
What, are you away or something,

2286
01:51:56,252 --> 01:51:58,585
'cause I called you earlier
today and you didn't answer.

2287
01:51:58,629 --> 01:52:01,213
I left a message for Marty
and he's not there either.

2288
01:52:01,257 --> 01:52:02,756
Like, nobody ever seems
to be around.

2289
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,134
Everybody's out of town
or something.

2290
01:52:07,346 --> 01:52:09,138
<i>I'm leaving you another message.</i>

2291
01:52:09,181 --> 01:52:11,014
<i>I know I keep leaving
you messages, Andrew.</i>

2292
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:14,184
I can't even reach Stephanie.
I can't reach anybody!

2293
01:52:14,228 --> 01:52:15,853
I'm seriously gonna lose it.

2294
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:16,896
I really am.

2295
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:21,817
<i>I'm, like, trapped in here.</i>

2296
01:52:21,861 --> 01:52:23,360
Guess what.

2297
01:52:23,404 --> 01:52:25,404
It's me again.

2298
01:52:25,448 --> 01:52:26,967
<i>I don't know
if you're away with Cath...</i>

2299
01:52:26,991 --> 01:52:28,282
<i>are you away with Catherine?</i>

2300
01:52:28,325 --> 01:52:30,367
I mean, where are
you guys, anyway?

2301
01:52:30,411 --> 01:52:32,369
Have you gone fishing?

2302
01:52:32,413 --> 01:52:34,307
It's just, like, ever since
she's been in your life,

2303
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:36,373
I can't fucking
reach you anymore.

2304
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:38,167
I can't ever talk to you.

2305
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:40,586
You're just, like, always
fucking on some holiday!

2306
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:45,966
Okay, ahem,
I just left you, like,

2307
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,177
a 20-minute message
and I got cut off.

2308
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:50,345
Andy, Marty,

2309
01:52:50,389 --> 01:52:52,159
I don't even know
who I'm leaving messages for.

2310
01:52:52,183 --> 01:52:54,349
I'm just leaving messages now,
you know what I mean?

2311
01:52:57,438 --> 01:52:59,207
We're supposed to just sit
around and, like, you know,

2312
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:01,690
with our dicks in our hands,
doing nothing?

2313
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:03,442
You know, I've been at this
for two years.

2314
01:53:03,486 --> 01:53:05,777
Two years.
Two years!

2315
01:53:05,821 --> 01:53:08,614
<i>I can't keep going on this way!
I have to make a statement.</i>

2316
01:53:08,657 --> 01:53:11,283
I gotta make a big statement!

2317
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:18,582
<i>I can't go on like this.</i>

2318
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,658
Stephanie's voice: <i>We're not here.
Leave a message.</i>

2319
01:54:16,058 --> 01:54:17,849
Mark, are you there?

2320
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:21,436
Mark, pick up.

2321
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:32,801
Woman's voice:
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

2322
01:54:32,825 --> 01:54:34,992
<i>to an automatic
voice message system.</i>

2323
01:54:35,035 --> 01:54:37,452
<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

2324
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:40,497
Mark, I just tried the house.

2325
01:54:40,541 --> 01:54:41,999
Uh... uh, call me.

2326
01:54:44,003 --> 01:54:45,961
Woman:<i> Come in.</i>

2327
01:54:46,005 --> 01:54:47,671
Mom.

2328
01:54:47,715 --> 01:54:49,089
<i>What's wrong?</i>

2329
01:54:49,133 --> 01:54:50,591
I just got
these messages from Mark.

2330
01:54:50,634 --> 01:54:53,010
Uh, I tried calling the house,

2331
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:55,178
but he's...
he's not picking up.

2332
01:54:57,182 --> 01:55:00,225
All right, yeah, I just...
I just pulled up.

2333
01:55:00,269 --> 01:55:01,893
I'm going inside.

2334
01:55:01,937 --> 01:55:04,021
I'll call you back.
All right.

2335
01:55:15,034 --> 01:55:16,700
Mark?

2336
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,546
Hey!

2337
01:56:11,590 --> 01:56:12,881
Hey, Nicky.

2338
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:15,509
What are you doing, huh?

2339
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:17,219
Wanna come with Papa?

2340
01:56:17,262 --> 01:56:19,846
We're gonna go outside.
You wanna go outs...

2341
01:56:24,728 --> 01:56:27,145
Okay, uh.
Grouper!

2342
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:29,064
Gotta get your blanky.

2343
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:32,067
<i>Grouper, come back.</i>

2344
01:56:32,111 --> 01:56:34,236
Hey, Nicky, with Papa
we're gonna play peek-a-boo.

2345
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:37,698
Grouper, come! Grouper!

2346
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,553
Grouper! Grouper, come!
Come on, that's a good boy.

2347
01:56:40,577 --> 01:56:42,661
That's a good boy.
Look at...

2348
01:56:42,705 --> 01:56:44,705
Grouper, good.

2349
01:56:44,748 --> 01:56:46,456
We're just gonna go outside.

2350
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,582
Andy:
<i>Hello?</i>

2351
01:56:47,626 --> 01:56:50,627
Marty:
<i>It's Marty.</i>

2352
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:52,170
<i>Mark's dead.</i>

2353
01:56:52,214 --> 01:56:53,964
Pinks:<i> Stephanie!</i>

2354
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:56,633
- Marty: <i>He... he hung himself.</i>
- Pinks:<i> He's dead.</i>

2355
01:56:56,677 --> 01:56:59,177
Andy: <i>Has anybody
called my mother?</i>

2356
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:01,138
<i>I have to call my mother.</i>

2357
01:57:10,899 --> 01:57:13,442
Andy?

2358
01:57:13,485 --> 01:57:16,987
It's so good to
hear your voice, sweetheart.

2359
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:46,892
Marty:
<i>I wrote Bernie a letter</i>

2360
01:57:46,935 --> 01:57:50,395
<i>a week after
Mark killed himself.</i>

2361
01:57:50,439 --> 01:57:52,272
<i>And I never sent it to him</i>

2362
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:54,232
<i>because they monitor his mail</i>

2363
01:57:54,276 --> 01:57:56,193
<i>and I thought
they would never, ever</i>

2364
01:57:56,236 --> 01:57:58,487
<i>give him a letter like this.</i>

2365
01:57:58,530 --> 01:58:00,133
Joy Behar:<i> Well, here, you can say
it on TV. He's probably watching.</i>

2366
01:58:00,157 --> 01:58:02,824
Well, what I wrote to him was,

2367
01:58:02,868 --> 01:58:05,577
"Bernie, while I will not

2368
01:58:05,621 --> 01:58:08,038
send you pictures
of your grandchildren,

2369
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:11,833
<i>there is one picture
I do want you to see.</i>

2370
01:58:11,877 --> 01:58:15,212
<i>That last picture
of your son Mark.</i>

2371
01:58:15,255 --> 01:58:17,798
You owe it to his widow,

2372
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:21,176
his children,
his brother, his mother.

2373
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:25,305
<i>So, here is what I wish
for you, Bernie.</i>

2374
01:58:25,349 --> 01:58:27,808
<i>Every time you sit down to eat,</i>

2375
01:58:27,851 --> 01:58:31,186
<i>as you pick up
your plastic fork,</i>

2376
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:34,397
<i>I want you to see
your son's corpse</i>

2377
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:37,984
<i>hanging from the rafter
directly over your table</i>

2378
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:41,112
<i>right on front of you, Bernie,</i>

2379
01:58:41,156 --> 01:58:45,325
<i>so at every meal,
you see your son Mark...</i>

2380
01:58:45,369 --> 01:58:47,869
<i>his white sweat socks
are swaying</i>

2381
01:58:47,913 --> 01:58:50,622
<i>ever so gently at your eye level</i>

2382
01:58:50,666 --> 01:58:53,792
<i>immediately above
your food dish.</i>

2383
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:56,002
And as you look up, Bernie,

2384
01:58:56,046 --> 01:58:58,338
you see...

2385
01:58:58,382 --> 01:59:02,342
<i>you see your firstborn
son hanging there,</i>

2386
01:59:02,386 --> 01:59:05,720
<i>his head at a left leaning angle</i>

2387
01:59:05,764 --> 01:59:07,848
<i>looking down at you,</i>

2388
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:10,725
<i>asking how could you do that
to your son</i>

2389
01:59:10,769 --> 01:59:13,353
<i>who up until two years
before his death</i>

2390
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,565
<i>had given you
the greatest gift...</i>

2391
01:59:16,608 --> 01:59:20,193
<i>his unconditional love
for his father."</i>

2392
01:59:20,237 --> 01:59:22,529
Joy: <i>Well, I hope he heard that.</i>

2393
01:59:22,573 --> 01:59:25,699
<i>- I hope he heard that.</i>
- Marty:<i> Well, he gets free television,</i>

2394
01:59:25,742 --> 01:59:27,325
<i>so why shouldn't he hear it?</i>

2395
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:29,786
<i>Why isn't he in a hole
where he belongs?</i>

2396
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:31,705
Joy: <i>He says that he
is happier in prison</i>

2397
01:59:31,748 --> 01:59:33,415
<i>- than he was before.
- Free meals!</i>

2398
01:59:33,458 --> 01:59:35,250
<i>- He feels safe in prison.
- His victims</i>

2399
01:59:35,294 --> 01:59:37,752
<i>are eating their dinner
out of cat food cans.</i>

2400
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:40,024
Joy:<i> Then he says, "The average person
thinks I robbed widows and orphans.</i>

2401
01:59:40,048 --> 01:59:42,841
<i>I made wealthy people
wealthier." That is not true.</i>

2402
01:59:42,885 --> 01:59:44,968
Marty:
<i>Mark... he wrote a note.</i>

2403
01:59:45,012 --> 01:59:46,469
<i>The note said,</i>

2404
01:59:46,513 --> 01:59:48,889
<i>"Bernie, this is what happens</i>

2405
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,224
<i>when you destroy your sons</i>

2406
01:59:51,268 --> 01:59:53,351
<i>- by your life of deceit."</i>
- Joy:<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

2407
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:55,270
<i>- "Fuck you, Bernie."
- Mm-hmm.</i>

2408
01:59:55,314 --> 01:59:57,981
<i>- That was Mark's suicide note.
- Right.</i>

2409
02:00:03,655 --> 02:00:06,489
Ruth:
<i>I can't keep coming here.</i>

2410
02:00:08,619 --> 02:00:11,578
<i>I want a relationship with Andy</i>

2411
02:00:11,622 --> 02:00:14,456
<i>and he won't see me
if I keep coming here.</i>

2412
02:00:14,499 --> 02:00:16,416
I can't have it both ways.

2413
02:00:16,460 --> 02:00:18,168
No, I understand.

2414
02:00:22,299 --> 02:00:25,258
And I can't talk to you anymore.

2415
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:28,470
<i>You can't write to me
or call me.</i>

2416
02:00:28,513 --> 02:00:30,388
<i>It'll be too hard.</i>

2417
02:00:30,432 --> 02:00:31,890
Ruth, all I want is what's best

2418
02:00:31,934 --> 02:00:33,308
for you and for the boys.

2419
02:00:33,352 --> 02:00:35,185
Boy, Bernie.

2420
02:00:36,855 --> 02:00:38,313
Boy.

2421
02:00:44,112 --> 02:00:46,529
You were my lifeguard.

2422
02:00:47,866 --> 02:00:51,201
I thought you were gonna
protect me forever.

2423
02:00:52,871 --> 02:00:55,246
Best job I ever had.

2424
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:57,540
I never had to save anybody.

2425
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:00,835
I don't know if it will ever

2426
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:04,089
be any different
than it feels now.

2427
02:01:04,132 --> 02:01:07,592
I don't think
after losing a child

2428
02:01:07,636 --> 02:01:11,388
things ever get better.

2429
02:01:12,808 --> 02:01:15,517
I don't see much
of a future for me.

2430
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:21,356
And I don't really care
if I have one.

2431
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:24,401
The future's hard.

2432
02:01:26,488 --> 02:01:29,990
Yeah, I was sorry to see
that "People Magazine"

2433
02:01:30,033 --> 02:01:33,535
used that photo of you and
Mark when he was a boy.

2434
02:01:35,330 --> 02:01:38,248
I can never forgive you, Bernie.

2435
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:42,377
And yet I'm not angry at you.

2436
02:01:42,421 --> 02:01:44,212
I don't know why.

2437
02:01:45,716 --> 02:01:47,716
It's a combination
of feeling numb

2438
02:01:47,759 --> 02:01:50,218
and it seeming fruitless.

2439
02:01:52,973 --> 02:01:55,515
I don't remember how much I
got paid as a lifeguard,

2440
02:01:55,559 --> 02:01:58,226
but it was never
about the money.

2441
02:02:04,151 --> 02:02:06,109
Diana:
<i>In 2013,</i>

2442
02:02:06,153 --> 02:02:09,112
<i>I invited Andrew to speak
at a writing seminar</i>

2443
02:02:09,156 --> 02:02:10,989
<i>I conducted at Princeton</i>

2444
02:02:11,033 --> 02:02:14,451
<i>under the general theme
of writing about con artists.</i>

2445
02:02:15,912 --> 02:02:18,329
<i>Andy had just started
chemotherapy</i>

2446
02:02:18,373 --> 02:02:21,207
<i>for the reoccurrence
of lymphoma.</i>

2447
02:02:21,251 --> 02:02:24,461
<i>The topic I asked him
to think about for the class</i>

2448
02:02:24,504 --> 02:02:27,756
<i>was how the media
had covered his father's case</i>

2449
02:02:27,799 --> 02:02:29,966
<i>and how that affected his life.</i>

2450
02:02:31,428 --> 02:02:32,927
Woman:
<i>I've always wondered,</i>

2451
02:02:32,971 --> 02:02:35,138
why didn't you go on TV
and state your case?

2452
02:02:35,182 --> 02:02:36,681
Why didn't you defend yourself?

2453
02:02:36,725 --> 02:02:38,808
Well, one of the reasons

2454
02:02:38,852 --> 02:02:41,644
I've always felt uncomfortable

2455
02:02:41,688 --> 02:02:45,523
about the prospect of going
on TV and telling my story

2456
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:48,318
is that I don't know if I'm
that sympathetic a character.

2457
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:50,904
<i>And at the end of the day,</i>

2458
02:02:50,947 --> 02:02:54,491
I lived a life of great
wealth and privilege.

2459
02:02:54,534 --> 02:02:57,327
I traveled the world.

2460
02:02:57,370 --> 02:02:59,412
I wanted for nothing.

2461
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:01,539
<i>All of that was subsidized</i>

2462
02:03:01,583 --> 02:03:03,583
<i>by my father's victims.</i>

2463
02:03:03,627 --> 02:03:08,421
It's hard to, um,
tell our story...

2464
02:03:08,465 --> 02:03:11,883
Mark's, my mother's, myself...

2465
02:03:11,927 --> 02:03:16,096
when there are
so many other stories.

2466
02:03:16,139 --> 02:03:18,389
<i>My brother killed himself.</i>

2467
02:03:18,433 --> 02:03:21,601
<i>My mother lost the only
man she ever loved,</i>

2468
02:03:21,645 --> 02:03:23,645
<i>turned out to be
a complete fraud.</i>

2469
02:03:23,688 --> 02:03:28,149
But, you know,
there were just three of us.

2470
02:03:28,193 --> 02:03:32,112
There are thousands of victims.

2471
02:03:32,155 --> 02:03:34,155
And, uh...

2472
02:03:37,285 --> 02:03:39,119
Any other questions?

2473
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,620
<i>Yes.</i>

2474
02:03:40,664 --> 02:03:42,372
Man: <i>The father-son relationship</i>

2475
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:44,582
<i>is such an important factor
in anyone's life.</i>

2476
02:03:44,626 --> 02:03:47,063
<i>There must be some part of that
relationship with your father</i>

2477
02:03:47,087 --> 02:03:48,586
<i>that still exists.</i>

2478
02:03:48,630 --> 02:03:50,547
<i>Even after all this,</i>

2479
02:03:50,590 --> 02:03:52,549
<i>can you see some point
where you could visit him</i>

2480
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:54,592
<i>or talk to him again?</i>

2481
02:03:57,264 --> 02:03:59,347
My father is dead to me.

2482
02:04:03,478 --> 02:04:07,397
Diana:
<i>On September 3rd, 2014,</i>

2483
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:09,274
<i>Andrew Madoff died</i>

2484
02:04:09,317 --> 02:04:12,277
<i>from mantle cell lymphoma.</i>

2485
02:04:32,507 --> 02:04:34,841
Ruth's voice:
<i>Hi, this is Ruth.</i>

2486
02:04:34,885 --> 02:04:37,218
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

2487
02:04:39,306 --> 02:04:41,264
Hi, Ruth, I just wanted to...

2488
02:04:41,308 --> 02:04:45,727
I know I said I wouldn't
call, but I just, um...

2489
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:47,312
um, okay.

2490
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:30,146
Ruth's voice:
<i>Hi, this is Ruth.</i>

2491
02:05:30,190 --> 02:05:32,315
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

2492
02:05:52,420 --> 02:05:54,379
Woman's voice:
<i>We're sorry.</i>

2493
02:05:54,422 --> 02:05:57,257
<i>You have reached a number
that is no longer in service.</i>

2494
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:00,551
<i>If you feel that you have reached
this recording in error,</i>

2495
02:06:00,595 --> 02:06:02,345
<i>please check the number and...</i>

2496
02:06:20,031 --> 02:06:22,156
Bernie:
<i>Hey, I was online today</i>

2497
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,158
<i>and I'm reading
some of the old coverage of me</i>

2498
02:06:24,202 --> 02:06:26,953
<i>and I came across this article.</i>

2499
02:06:26,997 --> 02:06:29,330
Frankly, it was just ridiculous.

2500
02:06:29,374 --> 02:06:31,457
What was the article?

2501
02:06:31,501 --> 02:06:34,419
The "New York Times" interviewed
this guy, a forensic psychologist

2502
02:06:34,462 --> 02:06:36,462
who worked
on the Ted Bundy case.

2503
02:06:36,506 --> 02:06:38,214
And this guy, Joe Blow,

2504
02:06:38,258 --> 02:06:40,258
whom I've never met,
never talked to,

2505
02:06:40,302 --> 02:06:42,363
don't know from Adam, never
seen in my whole entire life

2506
02:06:42,387 --> 02:06:44,137
was going on and on
about the similarities

2507
02:06:44,180 --> 02:06:46,389
between Ted Bundy and myself.

2508
02:06:46,433 --> 02:06:50,935
Ah, I can see how that comparison
would be troubling, but...

2509
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:52,353
Well, there is no comparison.

2510
02:06:52,397 --> 02:06:54,230
I mean, how can you
compare me to someone

2511
02:06:54,274 --> 02:06:56,733
who decapitated women and
kept their heads as mementos?

2512
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:59,944
I mean, that's the behavior of a
truly, truly evil human being.

2513
02:06:59,988 --> 02:07:05,491
I mean, what comparison is
there, ever, possibly in that?

2514
02:07:05,535 --> 02:07:07,493
And yet the "New York Times,"

2515
02:07:07,537 --> 02:07:08,828
"the newspaper of record,"

2516
02:07:08,872 --> 02:07:10,872
"all the news
that's fit to print"

2517
02:07:10,915 --> 02:07:13,833
never had anyone say this is a
preposterous piece of writing,

2518
02:07:13,877 --> 02:07:15,418
especially for
the business section.

2519
02:07:15,462 --> 02:07:18,588
Well, why do you think
they made that comparison?

2520
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:21,799
- You know, when I turned myself in...
- Your sons turned you in.

2521
02:07:21,843 --> 02:07:23,426
No, no, but I turned myself in.

2522
02:07:23,470 --> 02:07:25,553
It was a matter of a few days,
so I was gonna do it.

2523
02:07:25,597 --> 02:07:27,722
So anyway, when I
turned myself in...

2524
02:07:30,018 --> 02:07:32,204
it was the height of the whole
anti-Wall Street hysteria

2525
02:07:32,228 --> 02:07:33,956
and they needed a villain,
they needed a face

2526
02:07:33,980 --> 02:07:35,207
for the whole mess they created.

2527
02:07:35,231 --> 02:07:38,316
That face became me,
so that's...

2528
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:40,193
I don't know, I just...

2529
02:07:40,236 --> 02:07:42,528
I don't even wanna
think about it.

2530
02:07:42,572 --> 02:07:44,572
Think about what?

2531
02:07:44,616 --> 02:07:46,532
Well, he killed people,
innocent people.

2532
02:07:46,576 --> 02:07:49,369
And in my case,
I told people, everyone,

2533
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,057
"Don't put more than half
your money with me.

2534
02:07:51,081 --> 02:07:52,580
You never know.
Who the hell knows?

2535
02:07:52,624 --> 02:07:54,499
I mean, one day,
I could just go crazy."

2536
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:56,918
But the reality is
people are greedy.

2537
02:07:56,961 --> 02:08:01,214
Hmm, the reality is that not
even your warning was true

2538
02:08:01,257 --> 02:08:04,258
<i>and you took their money anyway.</i>

2539
02:08:11,851 --> 02:08:14,102
Let me ask you a question.

2540
02:08:15,772 --> 02:08:18,106
Do you think I'm a sociopath?

2540
02:08:19,305 --> 02:09:19,518
