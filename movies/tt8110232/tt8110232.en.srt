<i>Nam etsi ambulavero</i>
<i>in medio umbrae mortis,</i>

4
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:45,912
<i>non timebo mala,
quoniam tu mecum es.</i>

5
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:51,375
<i>Virga tua et baculus tuus
ipsa me consolata sunt.</i>

6
00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:54,462
<i>She was furious with
me, because if I had my law degree,</i>

7
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:56,839
<i>I could have represented us.</i>

8
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,674
<i>The jury ruled against me.</i>

9
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,344
<i>I told my lawyer
I considered suicide.</i>

10
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:04,347
<i>I drove home from Nyack,
and guess what?</i>

11
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,681
<i>She had left me.</i>

12
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,892
<i>I recall almost
a sigh of relief...</i>

13
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:10,394
<i>Somehow it
made a lasting impression on her life.</i>

14
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:12,897
<i>My first child
came easy enough.</i>

15
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,444
<i>But with Patricia,
they had to open me up under anesthesia.</i>

16
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:21,489
<i>I've often thought that
perhaps the reason...</i>

17
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:23,658
<i>I told them</i>
<i>when I got here,</i>

18
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,494
<i>"Okay, I explored
the criminal lifestyle."</i>

19
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:29,330
<i>But I was an altar boy,
for Christ's sake.</i>

20
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:34,502
<i>Moltisanti is a religious name.
And still I'm fucked.</i>

21
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:39,340
<i>I met death on Route 23,
not too far from here.</i>

22
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:42,552
<i>But that was much later.</i>

23
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:47,515
<i>Back in 1967,
the man wearing the hat was my father.</i>

24
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:49,767
<i>In those days,
he didn't have a son.</i>

25
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,061
Five dollars says
I spot him first.

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,896
I don't got five dollars.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,232
Then you better win,
<i>gagootz.</i> Huh?

28
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,068
Uncle Dick, think fast.

29
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,070
Oh, you want to fight, huh?

30
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,949
<i>The little fat
kid is my uncle, Tony. Soprano.</i>

31
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:05,992
You got nothing.

32
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:11,330
<i>Well, we call him</i>
<i>my uncle, by marriage.</i>

33
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,333
<i>He choked me to death.</i>

34
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,466
There! Pay up.

35
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,594
We have a winner,
ladies and gents.

36
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,804
Huh?

37
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:28,347
<i>My grandfather</i>
<i>and his brother were with</i>

38
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,933
<i>the DiMeo crime family
in Newark.</i>

39
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,810
<i>My grandfather
was an associate,</i>

40
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,103
<i>- but he stacked more</i> scharol...
- Pop!

41
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,855
<i>...than any of the made guys.</i>

42
00:02:35,938 --> 00:02:37,899
Hey, there he is!

43
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:40,484
<i>Including</i>
<i>a Cadillac dealership.</i>

44
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:48,075
<i>Cara mia, fammi presentare</i>
<i>mio figlio,</i> Richard Moltisanti.

45
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,745
Everybody calls me Dickie.

46
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:54,999
Welcome to America.

47
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:56,334
<i>Benvenuta.</i>

48
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,003
America!

49
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:04,800
Most guys 65 go to Europe on vacation,
they come back with the gout.

50
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,471
You come back with the winner,
Miss Provolone, 1967.

51
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:15,102
Oh. Antonio Soprano.

52
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:18,231
<i>U picceri.</i>

53
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:22,109
<i>After he murdered me,</i>

54
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:25,821
<i>Tony gave my wife and baby
his pocket change.</i>

55
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,740
<i>But that was much</i> later.

56
00:03:35,373 --> 00:03:37,959
<i>E squisita.</i>

57
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:42,296
I'm embarrassed.
You're all such great cooks over there.

58
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,549
Can you translate for me?

59
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,635
Forget it.
She understands enough.

60
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:06,654
Giuseppina,
what does your family do over there?

61
00:04:08,322 --> 00:04:09,407
<i>Mio padre...</i>

62
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,492
The fascists killed
her old man.

63
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,369
Her mother never recovered.

64
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:15,037
Fuckin' Mussolini.

65
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,415
I don't get it.
When I was a kid, you and Vito Genovese

66
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:18,749
always praised Mussolini.

67
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,002
Let's not talk politics
at the table.

68
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,046
But I'll tell you, Dick,

69
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,590
it's paradise over there.

70
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:29,510
On the one hand,
you can't believe the beauty.

71
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,014
On the other hand,
they don't even have toilets.

72
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:38,853
I told Giuseppina that "you're gonna
live the life of a proud American lady.

73
00:04:38,936 --> 00:04:42,898
And I'm gonna have my second
set of children with you."

74
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,775
And they'll be deluged
with a life

75
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,528
that they could never even
imagine over there.

76
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:51,240
Like you were, Dick,
as a kid.

77
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,618
These'll be your
brothers and sisters.

78
00:04:55,995 --> 00:05:00,124
So... Giuseppina
is your stepmother, Dickie.

79
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,630
Yeah.

80
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,917
It wasn't me
who ripped you off!

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,668
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

82
00:05:44,752 --> 00:05:46,128
Come on!

83
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,392
- Shit!
- Harold.

84
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:01,936
All right, already.

85
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:03,354
This punk ass snapper.

86
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:06,190
Japped one of our runners,
took 600 bucks.

87
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,985
I want a full bag tomorrow.

88
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,987
Who the fuck are you?

89
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,241
The guy who one time put out somebody's
eye for talkin' to him like that.

90
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,956
You winded there, Jesse Owens?

91
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:23,791
I gotta quit smoking.

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,585
I agree.

93
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:28,879
Can't I get you
to switch to Newports?

94
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:55,739
Hey, Harold.
My son here say

95
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,825
he gonna be Hank Aaron
when he grown up.

96
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:59,743
I'm gonna hit
318 like him.

97
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:02,872
Hmm. 318, your lucky
number, boy, play it.

98
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,623
Yeah. Numbers
is the only chance

99
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,333
Black folks got to get
out of this sinkhole city.

100
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:07,877
How does that work, anyway?

101
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,837
Well, you pick out
three numbers,

102
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,297
like for you, 3-1-8.

103
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,673
You bet a quarter,

104
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,175
and if your numbers
come on at the racetrack,

105
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,678
then you win
$125 for a quarter.

106
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:18,888
- For a quarter?
- Mmm.

107
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,348
Bet a dollar, you get $500.

108
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:23,434
- You shitting me, Harold?
- Uh!

109
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,227
What if my numbers
don't come out?

110
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,062
Well, if your numbers don't
hit, you don't get nothing.

111
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,356
Harold collects everybody's
bets and gives it to the Man.

112
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,026
How you think the Italians
drive those long, fancy cars

113
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,445
and wear those diamond
Swiss watches on their wrists?

114
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:47,333
Thank you. Thank you,
everybody, welcome.

115
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,834
Uh...

116
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:53,088
Well, mostly, I...
I just want to say how pr...

117
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,299
Knock it off, Anthony.

118
00:07:58,302 --> 00:08:01,889
I want to say how proud I am
of my big girl, Janice...

119
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,807
who is today...

120
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,060
a woman.

121
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,896
Cheers!

122
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,065
You know, Janice, she, uh...

123
00:08:11,148 --> 00:08:13,317
She went to her catechism.

124
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,319
She practiced her Latin.

125
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,239
She even stopped watching those
two <i>stunods,</i> Sonny and Cher,

126
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:19,740
long enough to think
about God, huh?

127
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,408
Too much fucking
salt on this.

128
00:08:21,492 --> 00:08:24,411
At least for a minute or two,
but... boy, did she cost me.

129
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,163
You know,
I made a bet that, uh,

130
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,624
Janice would not do
her religious duties.

131
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:32,336
But if Janice did,
you know, got confirmed...

132
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,547
I'd shave off my mustache.

133
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:38,300
Ooh...

134
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,261
- Enjoy.
- His <i>comare</i> told him

135
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:42,763
it makes him
look like Robert Goulet.

136
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,564
This stuff ain't so authentic.

137
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:52,690
Ow!

138
00:08:53,858 --> 00:08:55,568
Just use your fork.

139
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,111
But, you know,
the gravy's good.

140
00:08:57,194 --> 00:09:00,072
- Oh. Come here.
- Your daughter's confirmation.

141
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:01,365
Congrats, skip.

142
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,409
I'm here, too, Mr. Handsome.

143
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,578
Yeah, and looking like
a million dollars.

144
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:07,788
And not
Mexican dollars, either.

145
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:10,124
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:17,464
Same fucking gang. Colored kids
hit one of my colored runners.

147
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:19,675
Threw him a beating.

148
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:22,303
You believe this?
How these people prey on their own?

149
00:09:22,386 --> 00:09:25,306
Hey, Boot DiMeo's gonna
rag on me when he sees this.

150
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:27,474
It looks bad too,
perception-wise.

151
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:30,978
Even the papers say the numbers is the
biggest percentage of our cash flow.

152
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,648
Junior's right, you gotta get
your arms around this.

153
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,280
You got big ears there,
<i>gagootz?</i>

154
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:45,492
Big brother, go and get yourself some Pez.

155
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:53,208
Silvio, Puss, come here.

156
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,295
<i>- Marone!</i>
- Oh!

157
00:09:56,378 --> 00:09:58,005
Ah? The second
Mrs. Hollywood Dick.

158
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,215
I was just explaining
to His Holiness, here.

159
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,176
I think I went to school
with your father.

160
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:03,385
Calogero Dante.

161
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:05,512
"Butch."

162
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,640
He said you were a bully.

163
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:12,561
Whoa, what do we got here?
The Italian actress, Sophia Lotsa-Pizza.

164
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,897
Get out of here,
you fucking mutt!

165
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,566
Uh... Sorry.

166
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,527
Buddha. It's Joe D.
He's up at the Boot's Mansion.

167
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,864
Mr. DiMaggio. <i>Come stai?</i>

168
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:27,284
Your saints name you took
in church today, Apollonia?

169
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:30,329
She's the patron saint
of dentists.

170
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:42,091
Take it from me,
chains are more effective than snow tires.

171
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,009
Why didn't you bring
the missus, Dick?

172
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,887
I tried, but the poor kid's
self-conscious about her English.

173
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,098
She's making progress, though.

174
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,724
I didn't catch the name.

175
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,434
Pussy.

176
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,145
Don't worry, Father,
it's not what you think it is.

177
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,734
<i>This is my dog.</i>

178
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:04,613
This is my dog.

179
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,658
This is your dog.

180
00:11:07,741 --> 00:11:10,744
This is your dog.

181
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,080
Your dog.

182
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,459
<i>Buddy
Durham in the light trunks...</i>

183
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,086
<i>the white trunks.</i>

184
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:21,255
<i>Durham has always been known
as a counter-puncher...</i>

185
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,174
Huh...

186
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,427
<i>He gets</i>
<i>a great hook in there.</i>

187
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,011
Hey.

188
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:33,976
What did you learn to say?

189
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:40,149
This... is... his... ball.

190
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,987
Whose ball?

191
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:47,781
Spot.

192
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:55,372
Oh, I think this is
a waste of money.

193
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,916
<i>We hear from
Hoboken's own Chairman of the Board.</i>

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,878
<i>Hi, there,
my name is Francis Albert Sinatra</i>

195
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,337
<i>and I got news for you.</i>

196
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,548
<i>Here's your host,
William B. Williams.</i>

197
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,551
My mother met
his mother once. Frank.

198
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:12,473
Frank? He grabbed me
to go to some party once.

199
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:15,851
It was on the Upper East Side,
it was a penthouse.

200
00:12:15,934 --> 00:12:18,562
Some celebrity,
I don't know who.

201
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:24,568
So... he and Dean, they have this donkey
brought downstairs to the basement.

202
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:27,321
And the donkey's just stuffed
full of laxatives, right?

203
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,281
So they put it in
the private elevator.

204
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:32,159
They send the private elevator
up, the door opens,

205
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:37,247
and the donkey starts kicking and
shitting over everybody in the party!

206
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:43,796
Oh!

207
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,173
Ah, your sister's cunt!

208
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:49,176

You a friend of Dickie's?

213
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,153
No English.

Hopalong <i>Che Si Dice!</i>

217
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,752
Picked up from most of the
runners, but this kid, Overall...

218
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,337
Who the fuck is Overall?

219
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,422
He's a crazy young motherfucker
that runs the Saints.

220
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,382
Leon Overall.

221
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,217
He's from East Orange.

222
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,886
My cousin's, uh, the placekicker
over at the high school over there.

223
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,014
Yeah, well me and Harold played
East Orange Thanksgiving game.

224
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:37,891
We used to beat 'em
every fucking year.

225
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:39,393
You should have
seen this man run.

226
00:13:39,476 --> 00:13:41,228
Are you sure you don't
got no Black blood?

227
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:43,897
That's Sicilians.
I'm Napoletano.

228
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:46,358
Oh! I'm Siciliano.

229
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:50,696
Come on. Come over here.

230
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:59,037
The big picture, you told me this
thing was over with the Black Saints.

231
00:13:59,121 --> 00:14:00,873
I know, I...

232
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,166
thought I schooled the kid,
Overall, when I whupped him, but...

233
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:06,712
He's got a wild hair
across his ass.

234
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:10,007
I gotta know, Harold...

235
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,843
aren't you humiliated
by what you just said?

236
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:15,012
I know I would be.

237
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,764
You're a grown man.

238
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:20,434
Fucking punk street gang?

239
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,674
Come on in, son. Have a seat.

240
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:04,269
I think we lost him.

241
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,774
Hold up. Hold up. Turn around.

242
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:12,444
Would I for sure be going to Vietnam?
Like my dream?

243
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,154
You heard about the G.I. Bill?

244
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,949
Yeah, college. Sure.

245
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,408
Thinking about being a...

246
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:20,369

- Hmm.

247
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:22,871
Wait over there.

248
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:27,250
No, this... this war
wasn't my idea!

249
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,399
Isola, turn that light out.
I'm trying to sleep.

250
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:52,609
That's why I brought you

252
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:03,120

Put it away.

256
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,401
The army won't take me now.

257
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,406
I always wanted
to join up, but I...

258
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:41,992
I had two felony convictions.

259
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:43,243
Take you?

260
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:48,415
Happened to stop by a recruiting
office today, and it made me remember.

261
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:52,044
Brothers doing all the dying

276
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:44,197
Two officers picked up some colored taxi
driver, had to rough him up a little.

277

It spread around
the Central Ward that way.

279
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:49,870
They broke windows

298
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:16,665

What the fuck?

302
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,982
That's Belmont Avenue.

303
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:42,083
You wanna get smart now?

304

Why don't you go after
the <i>ditsoon,</i> huh?

306
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:24,084
They almost
burned the city down.

307
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,710
Oh, you'll hold
the door, huh.

308
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:27,295

Go home!
Take the bus.

What did they do?

317
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,870
We raided a card game,
but we got lucky.

318
00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:03,123
Picked up your husband
on an outstanding warrant.

319
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:04,124
Had to take 'em somewhere.

320
00:23:04,207 --> 00:23:05,458
Warrant? For what?

321
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,585
Assault with a deadly weapon.

322
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:08,920
The Lobster Trap Restaurant?

323
00:23:09,003 --> 00:23:10,547
That wasn't him.
He didn't do that.

324
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,589
Where is he?

325
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:13,091
Downtown.

326
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,801
He's downtown,
where he might get burned to death?

327
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:16,719
What are you people thinking?

328
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:18,638
Janice, shut up with that!

329
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:21,349
What were the two of you doing
at that card game?

330
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,768
Dad took Janice to ride the
rides while he played cards.

331
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:27,981
But he wouldn't take me because I
passed gas while he was eating lunch.

332
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:31,025
Get inside, both of you!

333
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:34,320
Anthony!

334

351
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,575
<i>This tells you right there that

352
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:05,578

complete Americans.</i>

353
00:25:05,662 --> 00:25:07,747

355
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:12,877
Huge fire.

356
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:15,672
Ashes.

357
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,729
Thought I heard
somebody fall.

358
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:34,816
You fall this morning?

359
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,236
I tripped in the bathtub.

360
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:40,655
Oh.

361
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:44,200
You shouldn't wear your
sunglasses in the tub, you know?

362
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:52,959
He's got a temper.

363
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,169
<i>È arrabbiato,</i> my father.

364
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,632
He start to yell.

365
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:02,510
Yeah, he wasn't like this
back in Ariano?

366
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,639
'Cause he used to...
me, as a kid.

367
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,891
Every day.

368
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,354
I should have stayed there.

369
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:14,731
No.

370
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:21,070
Maybe I come to
America for America money.

371
00:26:22,155 --> 00:26:23,239
But...

372
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:28,745
But here,
in America, he become...

373
00:26:30,204 --> 00:26:31,247
<i>Uno stronzo!</i>

374
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:40,548
I think maybe
you still love him.

375
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,477
What's the matter with you?

376
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,730
My wife's right inside.

377
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,235
You're my father's wife.

378
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:01,546
Oh.

379
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,258
Where are you going?

380
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:09,262
I'm going down to Rexall.
The doc switched my blood thinner.

381
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:10,763
I'll ride with you.

382
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:23,860
What?

383
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:25,987
How high did she bounce?

384
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,488
What are you talking about?

385
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,282
When you threw her
down the stairs.

386
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:31,409
Got two left feet.

387
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:33,077
'Cause you used to throw
my mother down the stairs.

388
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,787
I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

389
00:28:34,871 --> 00:28:37,832
Well, some women like the rough stuff.
Don't ask me why.

390
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:42,170
Yeah, it's funny how they're all
attracted to Hollywood Dick Moltisanti.

391
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,380
You wanted to get
into her fucking pants

392
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:46,299
since the day
I brought her over.

393
00:28:46,382 --> 00:28:49,469
I give you permission to picture
her while you're jerking off.

394
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:52,513
I promise you, you hurt her again,
you're going down the stairs.

395
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,640
- Who the fuck do you think you're fucking talking to?
- You got away with it

396
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:56,225
once with Mom.
But I was a little kid.

397
00:28:56,309 --> 00:28:57,560
You're not getting away
with it again.

398
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:01,814
Oh, I marry sluts.
What do I know?

399
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:06,444
Ow! Hey! Get...
Get your fucking... Get off me!

400
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,487
Hey! Hey!

401
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:16,496
Dick...

402
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,932
Pop.

403
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:49,779
Pop?

404
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,466
Uncle Dickie.

405
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,011
Anthony, what the fuck
are you doing?

406
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,596
The city's burning down.

407
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:57,847
Over on Springfield Avenue.

408
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,932
Dickie? Who blew the horn?

409
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:01,893
I'm working
on the car.

410
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,728
You want pork chops tonight?

411
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,062
Yeah, that's fine.

412
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:06,480
Can I watch you
work on the car?

413
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,815
With the applesauce?

414
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,984
I don't know what sauce!

415
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,652
I gotta go out for a while.

416
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:12,904
Can I?

417
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:14,822
Can you what?

418
00:31:14,906 --> 00:31:16,490
Watch.

419
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,075
What the fuck did I just say, God damn it?

Tell Ma what you told me,

There was a bird

A bird would never fly into
a garage to announce a death.

It's supposed to be cash.

Yeah, well, at least
you still got your brother. I'm...

Yeah. I got nobody.

Where's your brother?

00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:08,384
I wish that
the shooter killed you!

476
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:10,052
All of you!

477
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,482
John Francis Soprano.

478
00:37:23,565 --> 00:37:26,068
On the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon,

479
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:29,488
I hereby sentence you
to no more than five

480
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:33,659
and no less than two years
in Rahway State Prison.

481
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,364
Uncle Sally.

482
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:15,909
I'm Dickie,
your brother Dick's boy.

483
00:38:25,294 --> 00:38:26,712
How are you?

484
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:32,676
You know, I'm sorry,
I know I never came to visit you before.

485
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,345
My father wouldn't allow it.

486
00:38:42,061 --> 00:38:43,687
I came to tell you...

487
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,234
your brother, my dad...
he passed.

488
00:38:49,318 --> 00:38:51,528
They burned him up
in the riots.

489
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,908
I brought you
some sfogliatelle.

490
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,786
I don't eat dairy.

491
00:38:59,453 --> 00:39:00,287
Oh.

492
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:06,627
Well, you being
out here isolated,

493
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,170
out of contact
with the family,

494
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:09,797
my old man said
you deserved it,

495
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,925
but I want to do whatever I can
to help you from now.

496
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,010
It wasn't right
how they treated you.

497
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:17,888
I was 25.

498
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:21,767
I murdered a made guy
in our own family.

499
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:25,145
I'm here for a good reason.
You don't need to help me.

500
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,439
But...

501
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:29,066
What do you want, Richard?

502
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:37,157
I'll be honest with you.

503
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:41,453
I want to do a good deed.

504
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:42,788
Huh!

505
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:44,206
A what?

506
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:47,084
A good deed.

507
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:55,175
Miles.

508
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,344
<i>Birth of the Cool.</i>

509
00:39:58,804 --> 00:39:59,805
What?

510
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:00,889
It's a record.

511
00:40:00,973 --> 00:40:03,225
I'm a jazz nut.

512
00:40:03,308 --> 00:40:05,853
Bring me a copy
next time you come.

513
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:07,771
If you come.

514
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:25,622
<i>- Quant'e bella!
- Sì?</i>

515
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:28,584
It's so beautiful.

516
00:40:30,252 --> 00:40:32,296
We're gonna go down
to Bamberger's.

517
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,798
We're gonna fill
the place with furniture.

518
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:37,759
<i>Madonna mia.</i>

519
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:40,846
Mmm.

520
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:45,142
Could you give us
a few minutes?

521
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:46,560
You got it.

522
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:00,866
Aunt Concetta says
you've been looking for a job.

523
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:04,536
At, uh, DiLorenzo Brothers
Beauty Parlor.

524
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,538
I cut hair back in Ariano.

525
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:08,707
You don't need to do that.

526
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,792
I want to keep
taking care of you.

527
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:15,130
But I like to work, Dickie.
And America has so many work.

528
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:18,550
<i>Un giorno,</i> I want to have
my own beauty parlor.

529
00:41:18,634 --> 00:41:21,053
Well, you're not gonna work
for those two <i>fanooks.</i>

530
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:23,805
The DiLorenzos?

531
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,622
Motherfucker.

532
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:51,458
I like that word.

533
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,085
Motherfucker.

534
00:42:01,426 --> 00:42:02,761
Eighteen. Paul's birthday.

535
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,513
We don't take
Beatle birthdays.

536
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:06,431
We'd go broke.

537
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:09,935
Fuck it. Make it eight.
Micky Dolenz.

538
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:14,273
I dreamed about Whitey Ford last night.
He wears number 16.

539
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,527
<i>The boys basketball team is
playing St. Stephen's this afternoon.</i>

540
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,738
<i>The high temperature today
will be 53 degrees.</i>

541
00:42:21,822 --> 00:42:25,826
<i>Faculty advisory,
absentees: 16.</i>

542
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:28,036
Sixteen, I hit the number!

543
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,915
You gotta talk to him.

544
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:33,917
- Johnny should do it.
- You're the only one he listens to.

545
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:35,544
Johnny should do it.
You're gonna see him visiting day.

546
00:42:35,627 --> 00:42:36,962
Side door's open.

547
00:42:37,045 --> 00:42:38,463
Johnny's just gonna
want to hit him,

548
00:42:38,547 --> 00:42:40,591
and he can't because of
the glass partition

549
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,634
and he's just gonna
get frustrated.

550
00:42:44,386 --> 00:42:47,472
- Hey, Jun'.
- I got some Lady Schick blow dryers.

551
00:42:47,556 --> 00:42:49,933
Livia, take one for yourself.
One for Janice.

552
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,768
I got bigger problems
than blow dryers.

553
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:53,812
Anthony got kicked
out of school.

554
00:42:53,895 --> 00:42:55,606
Let me go talk to him.

555
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:57,816
I promised Johnny I'd take care
of Tony while he was in jail.

556
00:42:57,899 --> 00:43:00,485
The way you talk,
you just confuse him.

557
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:02,279
He only listens to Dickie.

558
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,323
<i>Ma vaffanculo.</i>

559
00:43:04,406 --> 00:43:07,075
Jun', leave me
a blower for Joanne.

560
00:43:11,955 --> 00:43:13,248
What are you reading?

561
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:18,921
Oh, can't you read
a regular comic?

562
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:20,964
You know,
Superman, Jughead.

563
00:43:21,048 --> 00:43:23,467
It's about some
Jewish girl and a knight.

564
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:25,052
And Robin Hood's in it.

565
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:28,513
I didn't know they had Jews
back in the Middle Ages.

566
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:30,641
Well... the Bible.

567
00:43:30,724 --> 00:43:33,852
Anyway, your mother
asked me to talk to you, so...

568
00:43:33,935 --> 00:43:36,605
What, about getting
suspended from school?

569
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:38,690
Hey, put that down, huh?

570
00:43:38,774 --> 00:43:40,025
Sorry.

571
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,202
You know I don't like to
lean on you about stuff.

572
00:43:50,285 --> 00:43:53,747
But you can't start a
gambling operation at school.

573
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,248
I know that...

574
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:56,583
now.

575
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,877
Hey, don't bullshit me.
You always knew it.

576
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,046
And it's not just the gambling.
It's everything.

577
00:44:01,129 --> 00:44:04,424
The cherry bombs at the YMCA, letting
the air out of Mrs. Russo's tires...

578
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:06,176
- I apologized to her!
- You talk big about

579
00:44:06,259 --> 00:44:07,844
wanting to be on the
football team in high school

580
00:44:07,928 --> 00:44:09,763
and you're smoking
already? Oh!

581
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:12,474
You gotta have
a better attitude.

582
00:44:12,557 --> 00:44:15,185
With your father gone,
your mother's got a lot on her plate.

583
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:17,187
You gotta be good.

584
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,731
I don't want to go
through this again.

585
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:21,400
I try to be good.

586
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:24,903
I don't think so.
Try harder.

587
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:30,409
Pinky swear?

588
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:31,785
Jesus.

589
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:33,912
Hey, you don't talk
to me like that.

590
00:44:33,995 --> 00:44:36,581
See, you're not listening.

591
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:39,501
Fine. Pinky swear.

592
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:48,969
All right.

593
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,390
One time I went to Playland...

594
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:56,727
I saw the cops shoot a friend
of my dad's right in the back.

595
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:01,148
Yeah, Chickie Sasso. He still
can't move his bowels like normal.

596
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:06,361
I don't want that
to happen to me.

597
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:09,614
And it won't, <i>gagootz.</i>
Not while I'm around.

598
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:12,242
We're gonna see
that it don't.

599
00:45:31,136 --> 00:45:35,098
Junior. Junior.
Where's Candy tonight?

600
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:36,475
Migraine.

601
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:38,268
Again with the migraine.

602
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:40,395
Keep a close eye
on that one.

603
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,231
She keeps disappearing, she's probably
fucking some Tom, Dick and Harry.

604
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:44,983
Found a new gravy train.

605
00:45:45,066 --> 00:45:47,027
A guy checks into a
hotel, calls up the front desk,

606
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,238
"I got a leak in the sink."
Clerk says, "Go ahead.

607
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:52,741
Customer's always right."

608
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:55,410
Yeah, that was funnier when
Henny Youngman told it.

609
00:45:55,494 --> 00:45:57,496
No, no, don't... Don't.
Just leave it the way it is.

610
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:01,458
I wonder what the origin of
the sobriquet "gravy train" is.

611
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,668
They named it after
the dog food.

612
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:05,337
I don't know
about you, Junior.

613
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,672
Guy tells you your girlfriend's
banging somebody else,

614
00:46:07,756 --> 00:46:10,175
you're worried about
the origin of "gravy train"?

615
00:46:10,258 --> 00:46:12,385
Oh!

616
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,304
Oh, smile, my brother.

617
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:20,185
White flight.

618
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:22,896
Oh!
It's Hopalong <i>Che Si Dice.</i>

619
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,189
Whatever the fuck
that means.

620
00:46:24,272 --> 00:46:27,901
Hey! Language.
There's ladies here.

621
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:29,528
What can I get you?

622
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:32,489
Bartender's special tonight,
for the ladies: Pink Squirrel.

623
00:46:32,572 --> 00:46:34,866
Courvoisier and Coke.
Water back.

624
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:38,036
That what they
drink on the plantation?

625
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,250
Oh, you didn't hear?
We're off the plantation.

626
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,086
We got wops digging ditches
since they come over.

627
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:47,754
Hey, come on.

628
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:02,811
It's Dickie's business.
Let it go, Paulie.

629
00:47:02,894 --> 00:47:04,980
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

630
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:06,857
You got a murder warrant
over your head.

631
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,359
I'm heading down south.
North Carolina.

632
00:47:09,442 --> 00:47:11,403
So where's your mule?
Get going.

633
00:47:11,486 --> 00:47:13,363
Thing is, I need to
borrow some money.

634
00:47:13,446 --> 00:47:16,241
- How much?
- A grand.

635
00:47:16,324 --> 00:47:19,703
All right, I'll tell you what.

636
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:24,541
I'm gonna give you
five C's. Yeah?

637
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:27,002
It's my gift to you.
You don't gotta give it back.

638
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,920
No, I want to pay you back.

639
00:47:29,004 --> 00:47:30,922
Ah, it's better this way. You don't
gotta be afraid to say hello to me,

640
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:34,259
I don't gotta chase you down.
Won't come between us.

641
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:36,386
So I guess this is goodbye.

642
00:47:42,767 --> 00:47:45,186
Yeah, you said your goodbye,
so go.

643
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:07,167
You don't stare at those people.
They don't like it.

644
00:48:15,884 --> 00:48:17,469
Brought you that
record you wanted.

645
00:48:17,552 --> 00:48:20,347
Plus, a couple others
I picked out.

646
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,140
What's this?

647
00:48:22,223 --> 00:48:26,311
Al Hirt. Trumpet.
He's on Carson all the time.

648
00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:29,272
It's not jazz. Take it back.

649
00:48:30,649 --> 00:48:32,400
These, too.

650
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:42,661
So...

651
00:48:42,744 --> 00:48:44,496
you did your good deed.

652
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:46,414
Well, don't put it like that.

653
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:49,459
I plan to do a lot more.

654
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:54,464
Your poor father, huh?

655
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:59,761
He goes down to board up that
Atta Boy business that he had...

656
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:03,515
and he dies
in that horrible way.

657
00:49:03,598 --> 00:49:05,350
It's just weird, though.

658
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:06,893
What, weird?

659
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:11,856
My brother's hands were soft.
Like a baby's <i>pishadeel.</i>

660
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,068
Always with the manicures,
your father.

661
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:16,820
Yeah, what's your point?

662
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:21,449
He never touched a hammer
or a board in his life.

663
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:32,085
What's your problem?

664
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:38,967
Well, for one thing...

665
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,845
my wife, she can't
get pregnant.

666
00:49:41,928 --> 00:49:45,390
You know, it takes a toll.
I want a son so bad.

667
00:49:45,473 --> 00:49:46,975
What would you do?

668
00:49:47,642 --> 00:49:49,477
It's the wanting.

669
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:51,563
Huh?

670
00:49:51,646 --> 00:49:54,899
The Buddhist will tell you:
"All life is pain."

671
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:59,404
Pain comes from
always wanting things.

672
00:50:00,655 --> 00:50:02,449
A son is not a thing.

673
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:05,744
It's the wanting.

674
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:14,127
You know, Tone, we could still run that
numbers game down at the fucking CYO.

675
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,463
I got fucking suspended,
I can't get in fucking trouble again.

676
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,798
No. Fucking school
will never know.

677
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,425
I want to
make it to the NFL someday.

678
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:22,010
For that, I gotta
go to college.

679
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:24,179
So I gotta watch
my fucking ass.

680
00:50:24,262 --> 00:50:27,057
My old man told me I gotta
run his fucking restaurant when I grow up.

681
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,975
What does your old man say?

682
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:30,935
He says I gotta fucking
rob your old man's restaurant.

683
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:35,982
Do you know who I'd wanna be?
Your Uncle Dickie.

684
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,776
How he fucking dresses.

685
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:41,279
He said he'd give me $500 if I
graduate from fucking high school.

686
00:50:41,363 --> 00:50:42,781
Fuck, man.

687

701
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:48,179
- Nothing changes.
- Yeah.

702
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,269
Nothing changes?

703
00:51:54,352 --> 00:51:57,063
That's... that's

704
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:02,026

705

706
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:06,281
How did you let this happen?

707
00:52:06,364 --> 00:52:08,491
Oh, what do you want
from me, Johnny?

708
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,869
I had plenty on my shoulders taking care
of things while you were in the joint.

709
00:52:10,952 --> 00:52:12,453
Yeah.

710
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:14,581
Raising Anthony. The disaster

711

- Ah!
- Your wife with the cramps.

712
00:52:16,207 --> 00:52:18,793
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Look at Dickie Moltisanti.

His father gets whacked,
he steps up.

714

Takes care of his family,
takes care of all the business.

715
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,968
Not a peep out of him.
He's younger than you.

716
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:29,429
Yeah.

717
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:31,431
Surprise!

718
00:52:31,514 --> 00:52:33,224
- Jesus Christ.
- There he is.

719
00:52:33,308 --> 00:52:35,435
All I want to do is bang my
<i>goomar,</i> go to sleep.

720
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:37,395
- Hey.
- Good to see you.

721
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:41,065
- Hey, Paulie, how's your ma, huh?
- Much better.

722
00:52:41,149 --> 00:52:42,275
Johnny.

723
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,861
Hey, baby, how are you?
Come here.

724
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,739
Oh...
Did the surprise work?

725
00:52:47,822 --> 00:52:49,824
You know, I'll tell you
what surprised me.

726
00:52:49,908 --> 00:52:51,409
You got shiners on
the block, huh?

727
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:53,661
Oh, look at you.
Not a pound.

728
00:52:53,745 --> 00:52:56,080
He's just a regular
Charlton Heston.

729
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:58,249
You come,
you visit...

730
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:01,336
But you don't tell me they moved in.
On my street.

731
00:53:01,419 --> 00:53:02,587
He's a doctor.

732
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,088
- A doctor.
- He's not operating on me.

733
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:06,007
You gotta berate me
in front of everybody?

734
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:06,966
Ah, Jesus.

735
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,884
You know, just like always.

736
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,927
Ah, <i>va' a Napoli.</i>

737
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,178
Come on.

738
00:53:12,013 --> 00:53:14,098
Hi, Dad.

739
00:53:14,182 --> 00:53:15,642
What do you got on?

740
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,977
Go upstairs, right now,
put on some decent clothes.

741
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,939
Johnny, it's what
they're wearing nowadays.

742
00:53:21,022 --> 00:53:22,732
Go do what I said, Janice.

743
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:27,695
Sweetie. You recognize
your daddy, pumpkin?

744
00:53:27,779 --> 00:53:31,532
Yeah. That's it. Yeah.

745
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:34,994

your father a proper hello. <i>Stunod!</i>

746
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,748
Come here.

747
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,419
I missed you, Dad.

748
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:45,838
I missed
you too, kid.

749
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:48,174
You know, I made your
favorite pizza gain.

750
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,218
Even though it's not Easter.

751
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:53,096
I got everybody together.
I dressed up.

752
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:56,015
And you spit on
it all, on me!

753
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,393
I didn't invite the coloreds
onto the block!

754
00:53:58,476 --> 00:54:00,061
Here we go.

755
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:02,188
Livia, give him a break.
He just did four years.

756
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,773
I did four years!

757
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:16,703
I missed
your baked ziti, baby.

758
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:19,706
I put extra veal bones in
with the sausage.

759
00:54:21,499 --> 00:54:24,335
How about you, <i>chooch?</i>
You gonna be a linebacker, huh?

760
00:54:24,419 --> 00:54:28,006
Coach says
I'm gonna be starting.

761
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:30,174
He don't have the makings of a varsity athlete.

762
00:54:30,258 --> 00:54:33,344
It was up to me,
you wouldn't be playing at all,

763
00:54:33,428 --> 00:54:35,513
but you went ahead and
you forged my signature.

764
00:54:35,596 --> 00:54:37,682
Nah, relax.

765
00:54:37,765 --> 00:54:39,017
He's not gonna get hurt.

766
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,936
Here he is.
Fresh from his nap.

767
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,187
- Joanne, Joanne...
- Yeah?

768
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:44,480
He hasn't met Johnny.

769
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:45,857
Aw.

770
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,983
Wow.

771
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,527
Johnny, this is
our Christopher.

772
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:56,492
Hello, Christopher Moltisanti.
It's your Uncle Johnny.

773
00:54:56,576 --> 00:54:58,077
I'm back from England.

774
00:54:59,454 --> 00:55:01,080
- Go with your daddy.
- Come here.

775
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,916
Oh! <i>Bambolino!</i>

776
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,254
Finally, huh? Corrado, right?
Got myself a son.

777
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,297
Hi.

778
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:11,466
I hear he's slow
with the talking.

779
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,134
Hi, Christopher, hello!

780
00:55:13,217 --> 00:55:14,510
Oh!

781
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:16,596
What's the matter?
Don't cry. It's only me,

782
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,181
- your Uncle Tony.
- Oh!

783
00:55:18,264 --> 00:55:19,557
- What's wrong. Cootchie-coo!
- Oh! Oh!

784
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,309
Okay. All right. All right.

785
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:24,354
You know, every time you're
near him he cries like this.

786
00:55:24,437 --> 00:55:26,064
I didn't do anything.

787
00:55:28,232 --> 00:55:30,276
What happened?

788
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,486
It's okay.

789
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:33,196
Look at that.

790
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:35,948
I don't know what it is,
it's like I scare him or something.

791
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,911
Some babies, when they
come into the world,

792
00:55:39,994 --> 00:55:43,498
know all kinds of things
from the other side.

793
00:55:55,051 --> 00:56:00,056
Night descends
As the sun's light ends

794
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:03,393
And Black comes back,
to blend again

795
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:05,561
- Wake up, nigga
- Yes!

796
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:07,355
And with the death of the sun

797
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:08,314
Wake up

798
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,233
Night and blackness become one

799
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:11,609
Wake up

800
00:56:11,692 --> 00:56:13,319
- Blackness being you
- Wake up, nigga

801
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:16,364
Peeping through the red
The white, and the blue

802
00:56:16,447 --> 00:56:18,449
Dreaming of bars,
Black civilizations

803
00:56:18,533 --> 00:56:20,118
That once flourished and grew

804
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:21,285
- Wake up, nigga
- Hey!

805
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:23,204
Wake up, niggas,
or y'all through!

806
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:25,540
He's right. He's right.

807
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:28,042
Drowning in the
puddles Of the white man's spit

808
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:29,293
Wake up

809
00:56:29,377 --> 00:56:30,628
As you
pause for some drawers

810
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:32,255
- In the midst of shit
- Wake up

811
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:35,341
And ain't got nothing
to save your funky-ass with

812
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,718
- Wake up, nigga
- You cool, fool

813
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:40,138
Sipping on a menthol cigarette
'round midnight

814
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:43,057
- Wake up
- Rapping about how the Big Apple is outta sight

815
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,226
- Wake up
- When you ain't never had a bite

816
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:46,269
Wake up

817
00:56:46,352 --> 00:56:48,938
Who are you fooling?
Me, you?

818
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:51,649
Wake up, niggas,
or we're all through!

819
00:56:51,732 --> 00:56:54,485
Yeah! Yeah!

820
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,748
That's some inspirational shit.
Even the speeches.

821
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:12,044
This decides me.

822
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,839
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start my own book.

823
00:57:14,922 --> 00:57:16,007
You're gonna do what?

824
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,592
We're gonna start...

825
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:22,221
first Black numbers bank
in the Central Ward.

826
00:57:25,933 --> 00:57:30,688
Nigga, you talking about facing
down the motherfucking mafia.

827
00:57:30,771 --> 00:57:32,565
Frank Lucas will be my backer.

828
00:57:32,648 --> 00:57:35,359
He's got money
up his ass from the skag.

829
00:57:35,443 --> 00:57:36,694
You know the Dope King?

830
00:57:36,777 --> 00:57:38,404
Down home.

831
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,781
Country boys.

832
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:44,035
This ain't Greensboro,
North Cackalacky.

833
00:57:44,118 --> 00:57:46,871
The Italians got
soldiers over there.

834
00:57:46,954 --> 00:57:48,456
Okay?
That's what they call 'em.

835
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:51,542
What... what's the matter,
you ain't no soldier?

836
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:53,461
Never thought about
myself that way, no.

837
00:57:53,544 --> 00:57:54,629
Well, think about it.

838
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:00,343
<i>Right. "He's got
a gun," you think, "and I haven't."</i>

839
00:58:00,426 --> 00:58:01,761
<i>You figure it's the gun.</i>

840
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:04,805
<i>Well, listen, soldier.</i>

841
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:08,226
<i>Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one Johnny Rocco!</i>

842
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:10,269
<i>How do you</i>
<i>account for it?</i>

843
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:12,355
<i>Well, he knows what he wants.
Don't you, Rocco?</i>

844
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:14,273
<i>- Sure.</i>
<i>- What's that?</i>

845
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,317
<i>Tell him, Rocco.</i>

846
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,735
<i>Well, I want, uh...</i>

847
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:20,404
<i>He wants more.
Don't you, Rocco?</i>

848
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:22,240
<i>Yeah, that's it. More.</i>

849
00:58:22,323 --> 00:58:24,075
<i>That's right, I want more.</i>

850
00:58:24,158 --> 00:58:28,246
Here. Why don't you buy you and
your friends some of those...

851
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:30,081
McDonald's.

852
00:58:30,164 --> 00:58:31,916
- The burgers?
- Yeah.

853
00:58:31,999 --> 00:58:33,626
<i>You, do you know what you want?</i>

854
00:58:33,709 --> 00:58:35,503
<i>Yes, and I</i>
<i>had hopes once, but...</i>

855
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:37,588
<i>Hopes for what?</i>

856
00:58:37,672 --> 00:58:40,800
<i>A world in which
there's no place for Johnny Rocco.</i>

857
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:43,886
<i>Okay, soldier, you can
make your hopes come true.</i>

858
00:58:44,845 --> 00:58:46,764
<i>But you gotta die for it.</i>

859
00:58:46,847 --> 00:58:48,849
<i>See where I'm aiming?
Right at your belly.</i>

860
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:51,435
<i>Go ahead, shoot.</i>

861
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:57,358
- Your turn, Daddy.
- All right.

862
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:08,911
Hey, Hopalong <i>Che Si Dice.</i>

863
00:59:10,538 --> 00:59:12,582
Oh, fuck.

864
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:18,629
How's it going, Harold?

865
00:59:18,713 --> 00:59:20,965
Cyril, how's your ass?

866
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,426
How you doing, son?

867
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:26,679
I'm taking my nephew
to the Yankees game.

868
00:59:28,723 --> 00:59:31,183
Is something funny
back there?

869
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:32,893
Sorry, Uncle Dick.

870
00:59:32,977 --> 00:59:35,021
No, really, I'm sorry!

871
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:36,480
You fuckstick.

872
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:38,316
I heard your ass
was back in Jersey.

873
00:59:38,399 --> 00:59:40,276
You still got that warrant
over your head?

874
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:43,571
Lead detective died.
Nobody gives a shit.

875
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:45,239
Leon Overall
had been a white boy,

876
00:59:45,323 --> 00:59:47,491
it'd be a whole
different story.

877
00:59:47,575 --> 00:59:51,287
Hey, Harold, how 'bout you come
around, talk to me over here.

878
00:59:59,086 --> 01:00:01,297
When are you gonna come back
and work for me again?

879
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:06,344
Got stuff of
my own percolating.

880
01:00:06,427 --> 01:00:09,013
While you're waiting for
that Maxwell House to boil...

881
01:00:30,117 --> 01:00:32,161
Hey, how much he give you?

882
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:37,166
Like I'm a fucking
Pullman porter.

883
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:39,001
Man, it's $100.

884
01:00:44,465 --> 01:00:47,259
I need to see the lease.

885
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:49,220
Here you go.

886
01:00:49,303 --> 01:00:50,346
Thank you.

887
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:54,558
<i>Due per cento</i>
increase every year.

888
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:56,727
Six and a half years still.

889
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:57,853
Right?

890
01:00:57,937 --> 01:00:59,146
- I like.
- Yeah.

891
01:01:00,815 --> 01:01:02,066
It's Dionne Warwick.

892
01:01:02,149 --> 01:01:04,276
Comes from right over here
in South Orange.

893
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,820
I love Dionne Warwick.

894
01:01:05,903 --> 01:01:07,363
Me, too.

895
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:10,366
I wonder where she
gets her hair done.

896
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:13,202
Probably some fancy place
in Beverly Hills.

897
01:01:13,285 --> 01:01:16,706
I bet she pays $100.
Oof! <i>Marone!</i>

898
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:19,041
I should move
to Beverly's Hill.

899
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,128
Where'd you learn to do hair?

900
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,088
I learned from <i>mia mamma.</i>

901
01:01:24,171 --> 01:01:25,840
- Mmm.
- My...

902
01:01:25,923 --> 01:01:29,301
She had a chair
in the front room.

903
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:33,556
Women would come,
and I sweep up.

904
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:34,598
And I watch.

905
01:01:34,682 --> 01:01:36,100
Oh, how wonderful.

906
01:01:36,183 --> 01:01:38,394
But that's not the life
I want for me.

907
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:39,979
- Mmm.
- Over there,

908
01:01:40,062 --> 01:01:42,148
you get old so fast.

909
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:45,317
Ten children and a big,
black dress.

910
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,027
You know, over there,

911
01:01:47,111 --> 01:01:49,280
I wanted to be a priest.

912
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:52,283
- You mean "nun."
- No, no, priest.

913
01:01:52,366 --> 01:01:54,827
Nuns have to do
what they told.

914
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:58,414
The priest is the boss. <i>Capo.</i>

915
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:03,586
So you never tried
the convent, huh?

916
01:02:03,669 --> 01:02:05,546
Not for me.

917
01:02:05,629 --> 01:02:09,216
I could not stand the silence.
No male.

918
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,634
No, yeah.

919
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:15,431
You wind up doing... push-ups
in the asparagus garden.

920
01:02:15,514 --> 01:02:16,640
You know?

921
01:02:22,146 --> 01:02:23,022
What's so funny?

922
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:24,899
Nuns.

923
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:27,443
Yeah. They weren't so funny when
they were hitting me with a ruler.

924
01:02:29,403 --> 01:02:32,031
First thing you gotta do is look at
the lease. Is that, uh, the lease?

925
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:33,657
We already look at the lease.

926
01:02:33,741 --> 01:02:35,117
It's good.

927
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:37,369
Oh, yeah? I'm gonna
look it over.

928
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:46,921
Two percent increase a year,
six years still remaining.

929
01:02:47,004 --> 01:02:49,715
There's just one
thing I want to make better.

930
01:02:50,382 --> 01:02:51,258
Oh, yeah?

931
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:52,927
- New sinks.
- Hmm.

932
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:55,346
Those are disgust.

933
01:02:55,429 --> 01:02:59,016
We can do that, sure.

934
01:02:59,099 --> 01:03:00,893
This is some
fantastic salsicce.

935
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:02,394
<i>Guarda basso.</i>

936
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,858
I am worried about
the fucking boiler, though.

937
01:03:07,942 --> 01:03:09,735
Looked like shit.

938
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,237
Inspector says it's fine.

939
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,781
Okay, okay. But the thing
about remodeling is,

940
01:03:13,864 --> 01:03:15,574
you start with the sinks
and then you go,

941
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:16,700
"We might as well do this
other thing while we're at it."

942
01:03:16,784 --> 01:03:17,660
It spins out of control.

943
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:18,619
Ah.

944
01:03:20,412 --> 01:03:22,873
We don't want to be pouring
good money after bad.

945
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:26,794

poi stammi a sentire.</i>

947
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:35,636
No <i>capisce,</i>
but I'm all fuckin' ears.

948
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:38,180
So we're not going to buy it
for me, the beauty parlor?

949
01:03:38,264 --> 01:03:41,559
All I'm saying, I don't want us
walking into a stupid situation.

950
01:03:41,642 --> 01:03:42,935
You think I'm stupid?

951
01:03:43,018 --> 01:03:44,895
Oh, let me ask you,
what are you, on the rag?

952
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:48,399
Every time I say something you don't
like, you ask me if I'm...

953
01:03:48,482 --> 01:03:50,192
<i>il marchese.</i>

954
01:03:50,276 --> 01:03:53,612
First you tell me to find a store
I can turn into beauty parlor.

955
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,739
I do that.
You say it looks good.

956
01:03:55,823 --> 01:03:59,493
Then you say, "No, let's buy a
place already a beauty parlor."

957
01:03:59,577 --> 01:04:02,037
I find this place.
Now the boiler!

958
01:04:02,121 --> 01:04:04,290
Sweetheart, why are we arguing
about fucking plumbing?

959
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,917
I always want to do
right by you!

960
01:04:07,001 --> 01:04:09,086
You know, I love you!

961
01:04:09,169 --> 01:04:10,504
<i>Io ti voglio piu bene di quanto tu
ne vuoi a me, lo vuoi capire o no?</i>

962
01:04:10,588 --> 01:04:11,881
You know
I don't speak Italian!

963
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:13,632
Maybe you should learn!

964
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:14,925
Oh, where you going?

965
01:04:15,009 --> 01:04:17,344
To put on a robe.
I'm cold.

966
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,035
Better hurry up.
Pot roast night.

967
01:04:41,118 --> 01:04:42,870
Right. You know Wednesdays
I gotta go home.

968
01:04:42,953 --> 01:04:44,330
And what are you
getting so pissy about?

969
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,290
Why did I make the sausage?

970
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:48,918
To make me happy?

971
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,378
Because I love it?

972
01:04:51,462 --> 01:04:53,672
But it's not as good as
Joanne's fucking pot roast.

973
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,716
Oh, you're digging
at Joanne again.

974
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:56,884
I hate her.

975
01:04:56,967 --> 01:05:00,554
Of course you do.
It's only natural.

976
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:03,349
Go home and eat.
I don't want the beauty salon.

977
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:04,642
No, <i>vaffanculo.</i>

978
01:05:04,725 --> 01:05:06,060
Motherfucker!

979
01:05:07,978 --> 01:05:09,772
You think you know everything!

980
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,672
Jackie, you drive stick?

981
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:36,215
- Fuck no.
- I do!

982
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:37,174
You drive.

983
01:05:37,257 --> 01:05:39,134
Grab his arm, hold him down.

984
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,470
Fucking punks!

985
01:05:47,768 --> 01:05:49,728
We're gonna get in
so much fucking trouble!

986
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:52,064
My father's gonna
use the belt on me!

987
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:53,816
You little shit!

988
01:05:53,899 --> 01:05:58,320
If anybody tells anybody about
this, next time we use the belt.

989
01:05:58,404 --> 01:06:02,032
<i>♪ Stand back, stand back,
stand back, ♪</i>

990
01:06:02,116 --> 01:06:07,871
<i>♪ It's my freedom Ah,
don't worry 'bout me, babe ♪</i>

991
01:06:07,955 --> 01:06:10,874
Oh! Come here!
Free ice cream!

992
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:18,882
Here, here.

993
01:06:21,635 --> 01:06:23,053
Get more of it.

994
01:06:27,474 --> 01:06:30,394
Here, here. Here you go.
Here you go.

995
01:06:30,477 --> 01:06:33,814
How 'bout this one?
There you go, sweetheart.

996
01:06:36,817 --> 01:06:38,777
That manicott
at Vesuvio's is so rich.

997
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,155
How'd you hear about them
throwing Mister Softee a beating?

998
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:43,407
His cousin Tony
Blundetto told Janice.

999
01:06:43,490 --> 01:06:45,617
I was down in the
islands when he pulled that shit.

1000
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:48,579
If I was home, I'd have given
him a <i>schiaffo</i> he'd never forget.

1001
01:06:48,662 --> 01:06:50,330
What's he want to be
when he gets older?

1002
01:06:50,414 --> 01:06:52,750
Thinks he's gonna be
a football player.

1003
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:56,170
He's good.
I don't think he's pro material.

1004
01:06:56,253 --> 01:06:57,880
What do you think, Dick?

1005
01:06:57,963 --> 01:07:00,883
Probably not. But who knows,
he puts on a few pounds,

1006
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:02,676
four years of college ball...

1007
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,636
He should go to work
for my cousin Frank

1008
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,430
in the patio
furniture business.

1009
01:07:06,513 --> 01:07:07,723
Here we go with that tune.

1010
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:09,183
So maybe he's not
a ball player, but Li,

1011
01:07:09,266 --> 01:07:10,476
you don't wanna step
on the kid's dream.

1012
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,894
You always
take his side.

1013
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:14,271
Look, you give him
the best advice you can,

1014
01:07:14,354 --> 01:07:17,066
you lead by example,
he'll make the right decision.

1015
01:07:17,149 --> 01:07:19,443
This kid's got what it takes.
That's what I'm saying.

1016
01:07:19,526 --> 01:07:22,279
We all do things like that
when we're kids, right?

1017
01:07:22,362 --> 01:07:24,114
Beat up the Mister Softee man.

1018
01:07:24,198 --> 01:07:27,409
If my Christopher grew up to be like
Tony, I'd be goddamn proud of him.

1019
01:07:27,493 --> 01:07:29,161
I told him the other day,
I said,

1020
01:07:29,244 --> 01:07:31,580
"You play football for a
career, it doesn't last long.

1021
01:07:31,663 --> 01:07:34,583
You wind up an old crippled
man by the time you're 32."

1022
01:07:34,666 --> 01:07:38,212
Bobby Piocosta, he's a junior,
on Anthony's team.

1023
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:40,631
He fractured
his shoulder last week.

1024
01:07:40,714 --> 01:07:42,257
The mother was hysterical.

1025
01:07:42,341 --> 01:07:44,468
They had to take him to
a specialist at St. Barnabas.

1026
01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:46,178
You think the school's
gonna pay for that?

1027
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:48,138
That's some
Christmas present, huh?

1028
01:07:48,222 --> 01:07:51,683
Having your kid laid up. He can't
help outside, hang the decorations.

1029
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:53,477
He can't help
shovel the walk...

1030
01:08:05,739 --> 01:08:07,282
Don't give me that look.

1031
01:08:32,099 --> 01:08:34,268
I though it will be different.

1032
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:37,187
What?

1033
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,983
Make love with a Black man.

1034
01:08:42,276 --> 01:08:43,235
Is it?

1035
01:08:45,571 --> 01:08:46,446
No.

1036
01:08:49,616 --> 01:08:52,703
It's all about
Italian men, huh?

1037
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:55,539
There's stories about Dean
Martin and Rossano Brazzi,

1038
01:08:55,622 --> 01:08:57,124
how they're great lovers.

1039
01:08:58,792 --> 01:09:00,043
If you feed them.

1040
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,548
Oh!

1041
01:09:04,631 --> 01:09:08,218
You gotta give Dickie his
meatballs and his noodles.

1042
01:09:08,302 --> 01:09:10,345
I'm Dickie's <i>comare.</i>

1043
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:17,728
Dickie and his friends,
they like their women to stay at home.

1044
01:09:17,811 --> 01:09:19,730
Don't go out.

1045
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:21,857
Wait on them, hand and feet.

1046
01:09:25,068 --> 01:09:27,321
I'd stack my bread
if you were my girl.

1047
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:30,574
You want to have
your own beauty parlor?

1048
01:09:30,657 --> 01:09:33,243
Knock yourself out.
I'd even back it.

1049
01:09:33,327 --> 01:09:35,287
You want your woman to work?

1050
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:37,581
No, but I'd be
real proud of her.

1051
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,834
Owning a business.

1052
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:43,337
My mama used to
take in the washing.

1053
01:09:45,005 --> 01:09:47,132
I always respected her
for that.

1054
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:58,602
Dickie says colored men don't
have no head for making money.

1055
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:13,992
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

1056
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,260
<i>You will not
be able to stay home brother!</i>

1057
01:10:31,343 --> 01:10:33,553
Four, two, seven.

1058
01:10:33,637 --> 01:10:35,013
Box it for me?

1059
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:36,974
You know, another nurse
hit the number last night.

1060
01:10:37,057 --> 01:10:38,267
Big time.

1061
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,143
Damn. Who was it?

1062
01:10:40,227 --> 01:10:42,229
What do I know, it was
up in the First Ward.

1063
01:10:42,312 --> 01:10:43,981
It was, uh...
It was St. Michaels.

1064
01:10:44,064 --> 01:10:46,984
That jinxes it for me.

1065
01:10:47,067 --> 01:10:48,694
<i>The revolution
will not be brought to you</i>

1066
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,862
<i>by the</i> Schaefer Award Theatre.

1067
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:54,449
<i>And will not star Natalie Woods and
Steve McQueen or Bullwinkle and Julia.</i>

1068
01:10:56,576 --> 01:10:59,288
See, the law of averages say you
got the same chance of hitting

1069
01:10:59,371 --> 01:11:00,664
as any two random people.

1070
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:02,582
Yeah, but two people
at the same time

1071
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:04,376
don't have
the same chance of winning.

1072
01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:05,877
That's the law of averages.

1073
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,463
That's a fallacy, Ms.
Johnson. It's all random.

1074
01:11:08,547 --> 01:11:10,090
You don't understand fate.

1075
01:11:13,677 --> 01:11:15,470
What do you got
for me, professor?

1076
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:18,807
See you tomorrow.

1077
01:11:26,231 --> 01:11:28,442
Tomorrow there'll be
a brother here for the pickup.

1078
01:11:30,694 --> 01:11:32,612
No more whitey's cut.

1079
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:42,164
What the fuck, man?

1080
01:11:45,709 --> 01:11:48,170
<i>The revolution will be live.</i>

1081
01:11:56,303 --> 01:12:01,433
And this Black guy,
Harold McBrayer, popped one of my guys.

1082
01:12:01,516 --> 01:12:03,393
He used to be a runner
of mine.

1083
01:12:03,477 --> 01:12:05,771
We don't know who ordered it.
We can't find McBrayer.

1084
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:09,107
So what do you
want from me?

1085
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:12,194
I was thinking maybe
you could ask in here.

1086
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:14,279
Nation of Islam,
talk to Alonzo Turner,

1087
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:15,906
see if any of them
knows anything.

1088
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:18,408
I don't talk
to people in here.

1089
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,495
I mostly read all day.

1090
01:12:25,582 --> 01:12:28,001
How you doing
on your merit badges?

1091
01:12:30,796 --> 01:12:33,423
I'm coaching
a beep baseball team.

1092
01:12:33,507 --> 01:12:35,008
A who?

1093
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:38,220
It's baseball. For blind kids.

1094
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:41,348
Get the fuck outta here.

1095
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:42,933
No, for real.

1096
01:12:53,026 --> 01:12:54,736
Run, run, run, come on!

1097
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:56,238
Shortstop, left!

1098
01:12:57,656 --> 01:12:59,616
Attaboy!

1099
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:02,911
Way to go, Coach.
Our boys looked sterling out there today.

1100
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:06,415
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

1101
01:13:06,498 --> 01:13:10,377
Coach Moltisanti!
Coach Moltisanti!

1102
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,962
You're a saint!

1103
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:04,055
- Oh, shit!
- Gun!

1104
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,019
Where's Harold?

1105
01:14:09,102 --> 01:14:11,354
In your mother's
fat guinea ass.

1106
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:13,023
You take that back!

1107
01:14:13,106 --> 01:14:15,317
Who put him up to it,
Angelo Salerno?

1108
01:14:16,026 --> 01:14:17,527
Anthony Bello?

1109
01:14:17,611 --> 01:14:19,112
Chef Boyardee.

1110
01:14:20,572 --> 01:14:22,365
Come.

1111
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:25,368
Put him on the table!

1112
01:14:27,245 --> 01:14:29,080
Pussy, grab his legs.

1113
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:34,544
What are you gonna do,
rotate my tires?

1114
01:14:37,797 --> 01:14:39,549
Dick, I just got this jacket.

1115
01:14:43,303 --> 01:14:44,221
You...

1116
01:14:46,306 --> 01:14:47,766
Open!

1117
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:48,725
What about it?

1118
01:14:48,808 --> 01:14:49,893
Fuck you!

1119
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,399
Stop for a minute!

1120
01:14:56,483 --> 01:14:58,527
God damn it!

1121
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:01,071
Oh! I don't fucking...

1122
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:03,573
So?

1123
01:15:05,575 --> 01:15:08,078
Harold! Harold McBrayer!

1124
01:15:08,161 --> 01:15:09,621
I asked you
whose idea it was!

1125
01:15:09,704 --> 01:15:12,958
I told you! It was Harold!
Nobody put him up to it!

1126
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:14,167
Oh.

1127
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:35,480
The fucker
acted on his own?

1128
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,275
All right, Dickie.

1129
01:15:38,358 --> 01:15:40,235
Go get it.

1130
01:15:42,862 --> 01:15:46,950
<i>That fall, Johnny moved
to the suburbs, the Black thing.</i>

1131
01:15:47,033 --> 01:15:50,287
<i>And he was seriously earning.</i>

1132
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:53,456
<i>This move made Tony half a
pussy, in my estimation.</i>

1133
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:58,336
What made
you think it was a good idea

1134
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,797
to steal the answers
to the geometry test?

1135
01:16:02,716 --> 01:16:06,094
I didn't study,
and, uh, I needed to pass,

1136
01:16:06,177 --> 01:16:08,763
so I could stay
on the football team.

1137
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:10,181
You know,

1138
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:12,183
you got Charlie Nodzak
in trouble, too,

1139
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:15,228
when you paid him
for the answers.

1140
01:16:15,312 --> 01:16:17,689
Well, he was the only kid
I knew on the mimeo squad.

1141
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:20,567
Well, Charlie was
on the honor roll.

1142
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,736
And you're missing the point.

1143
01:16:22,819 --> 01:16:24,946
You know stealing
the tests was wrong.

1144
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:29,034
Yeah, I guess so.

1145
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,869
But if you're gonna
kick me out of school,

1146
01:16:30,952 --> 01:16:33,538
I mean, you should just do it,
instead of us talking about it.

1147
01:16:35,915 --> 01:16:37,917
You talk a lot at home?

1148
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,421
I don't know.

1149
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:47,844
Well, your dad, for example,
what does he talk to you about?

1150
01:16:51,097 --> 01:16:52,140
The lawn.

1151
01:16:53,099 --> 01:16:54,434
What about the lawn?

1152
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:57,520
I don't know,

1153
01:16:57,604 --> 01:17:01,566
he goes to Yankee Stadium and he comes
home and says our lawn looks crummy.

1154
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,737
What about your mother?
Is she someone who likes to talk a lot?

1155
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:08,698
I guess so.

1156
01:17:11,284 --> 01:17:12,160
Well...

1157
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:15,121
what makes her happy?

1158
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:16,956
Happy?

1159
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,249
My mother?

1160
01:17:23,755 --> 01:17:25,757
Let's go, Anthony.

1161
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,135
I wonder if I could talk
to you for a moment alone, Mrs. Soprano?

1162
01:17:30,136 --> 01:17:31,596
Well, it's gonna
have to be fast,

1163
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:33,306
'cause I'm parked
at the hydrant.

1164
01:17:38,812 --> 01:17:40,939
On the basis
of the Stanford-Binet,

1165
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,566
he's high IQ,
but you know that.

1166
01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:47,445
You can't prove it by me.
He's got a D-plus average.

1167
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:51,991
Well, that's because he doesn't
apply himself, but he is smart.

1168
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:58,832
There's a big difference between
a smart person and a smart aleck.

1169
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:04,087
I also administered the Briggs-Myer
personality inventory just now,

1170
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,506
and the results tell us,
he's a leader.

1171
01:18:07,799 --> 01:18:11,428
"Enthusiastic,
insightful, playful."

1172
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:14,139
Ah, you're talking
through your hat.

1173
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:19,936
He did tell me one thing
I'd like to share with you.

1174
01:18:20,019 --> 01:18:22,564
But it's gotta be fast,
because I'm still at the hydrant.

1175
01:18:22,647 --> 01:18:24,274
Do you remember
a children's book called

1176
01:18:24,357 --> 01:18:25,734
<i>- Sutter's Mill?</i>
- No.

1177
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:28,403
About the gold rush
in California?

1178
01:18:28,486 --> 01:18:31,156
Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah?

1179
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:35,368
He told me about a night
your husband was... away.

1180
01:18:37,537 --> 01:18:39,748
And you got in the bed
with Anthony and hugged him.

1181
01:18:47,213 --> 01:18:48,465
He said that?

1182
01:18:48,548 --> 01:18:52,177
No, his exact words were
you "snuggled up close."

1183
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,980
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember that now.

1184
01:19:04,063 --> 01:19:06,483
You read to him
from that book.

1185
01:19:06,566 --> 01:19:08,401
Long into the night,
apparently.

1186
01:19:08,485 --> 01:19:10,737
He remembered details.

1187
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:12,489
He didn't know
the word "ingot,"

1188
01:19:12,572 --> 01:19:14,866
and you explained it to him.

1189
01:19:20,205 --> 01:19:23,124
He said it was one of his
best memories of his life.

1190
01:19:35,011 --> 01:19:36,930
Is that a hotel Bible?

1191
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:40,600
I forget where I got it.

1192
01:19:41,601 --> 01:19:44,813
Baby, Cousin Cyril is dead.

1193
01:20:01,704 --> 01:20:03,164
You're supposed
to do an hour.

1194
01:20:03,248 --> 01:20:05,291
It's an hour on,
ten minutes off.

1195
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:08,211
All of a sudden youse two are
only on 40 minutes and then disappear.

1196
01:20:08,294 --> 01:20:10,421
We don't know
where the fuck you are.

1197
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:13,091
We're off somewhere thinking, "What more
can we do for Gentleman Dick and Johnny?"

1198
01:20:13,174 --> 01:20:14,717
Don't get cute.

1199
01:20:14,801 --> 01:20:16,719
Where's Giuseppina tonight?

1200
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,889
The movies
with her girlfriend.

1201
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:21,516
I would eat her shit.

1202
01:20:21,599 --> 01:20:22,725
Oh!

1203
01:20:26,437 --> 01:20:28,481
You don't talk
about her that way.

1204
01:20:28,565 --> 01:20:30,733
In fact, you don't
talk about her at all.

1205
01:20:30,817 --> 01:20:32,068
Hey, take it easy!

1206
01:20:32,151 --> 01:20:34,070
I love her. I love her!

1207
01:20:34,153 --> 01:20:36,030
Get down!

1208
01:20:38,825 --> 01:20:40,660
- Hey, asshole!
- Dickie!

1209
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:42,495
Motherfucker!

1210
01:20:49,919 --> 01:20:51,588
Come on, you fucker.
Come here.

1211
01:20:51,671 --> 01:20:53,256
You like that, huh?

1212
01:20:53,339 --> 01:20:55,049
- How 'bout that?
- Come on, you motherfuckers.

1213
01:20:57,594 --> 01:20:58,928
Fuck!

1214
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,818
No, no, no! Frankie,
Frankie, Frankie! Frankie!

1215
01:21:14,694 --> 01:21:15,612
No!

1216
01:21:16,946 --> 01:21:17,947
You mother...

1217
01:21:22,035 --> 01:21:22,952
Shit!

1218
01:22:55,628 --> 01:22:57,255
Anthony, come eat!

1219
01:23:02,635 --> 01:23:04,053
There's my big boy.

1220
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:06,222
Oh, cool, man, a hamburger.

1221
01:23:06,305 --> 01:23:08,891
I thought you'd like a change
from a mortadella sandwich.

1222
01:23:08,975 --> 01:23:10,727
I made it special for you.

1223
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:15,023
You look nice.

1224
01:23:15,106 --> 01:23:16,774
Aw.

1225
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:20,361
Me and Aunt Mary are going to
the city to see <i>No, No, Nanette.</i>

1226
01:23:21,321 --> 01:23:22,405
What's that?

1227
01:23:22,488 --> 01:23:24,157
Broadway. A play.

1228
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,909
Shoes are killing my bunions.

1229
01:23:26,993 --> 01:23:29,454
You should go see
Dr. Cuomo.

1230
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:31,873
We don't go to him anymore.

1231
01:23:32,749 --> 01:23:34,167
We don't?

1232
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:37,253
He said some
very rude things to me.

1233
01:23:37,336 --> 01:23:38,463
Like what?

1234
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:42,258
He wants me to take pills
for my sleeping.

1235
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:44,260
And... and other things.

1236
01:23:45,845 --> 01:23:47,680
I'm not some lunatic.

1237
01:23:49,098 --> 01:23:51,434
No, but maybe some
medicine would be good.

1238
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:54,437
Ah, you and your father.
Why don't you get in line to blame me?

1239
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,606
I wasn't blaming you,
I was just saying...

1240
01:23:56,689 --> 01:24:00,318
This new thing...
called Elavil.

1241
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:02,236
For people who are sick
in the head.

1242
01:24:06,699 --> 01:24:12,455
♪ <i>Go runnin' for the shelter</i>
<i>Of a mother's little helper ♪</i>

1243
01:24:12,538 --> 01:24:13,372
What?

1244
01:24:14,373 --> 01:24:15,958
It's a song.

1245
01:24:16,042 --> 01:24:17,043
It's by the Stones.

1246
01:24:17,126 --> 01:24:19,003
Exactly what I'm talking about.

1247
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:21,631
They're drug addicts.
I don't take drugs.

1248
01:24:21,714 --> 01:24:25,343
The song's not saying
that you take drugs, it's...

1249
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:31,057
You smoking marijuana,
I suppose?

1250
01:24:32,016 --> 01:24:33,810
Mom, I'm on the team.

1251
01:24:33,893 --> 01:24:36,813
Your sister is.
I'm almost sure of it.

1252
01:24:36,896 --> 01:24:39,148
- This hamburger's great, Mom. It's really good.
- Agh!

1253
01:24:39,232 --> 01:24:41,484
Go on.

1254
01:24:41,567 --> 01:24:43,402
I went to all that trouble

1255
01:24:43,486 --> 01:24:45,988
just so we could have a nice
conversation for once, and for what?

1256
01:24:46,072 --> 01:24:48,866
How am I supposed to enjoy
a Broadway show

1257
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,368
with my children
and their pot?

1258
01:24:50,451 --> 01:24:51,953
Ma, I don't smoke pot!

1259
01:24:52,036 --> 01:24:53,830
Well, your sister comes in here
smelling like a gypsy.

1260
01:24:53,913 --> 01:24:56,415
Well, I'm not my sister.
I'm always being accused.

1261
01:24:56,499 --> 01:24:59,669
Oh! Poor you!

1262
01:25:21,399 --> 01:25:23,651
<i>Sempre, sì,</i>
<i>sempre problemi al cuore.</i>

1263
01:25:26,612 --> 01:25:27,905
Don't look so blue, kid.

1264
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:31,033
You and me'll cut out,
go play catch.

1265
01:25:31,117 --> 01:25:32,535
It's raining.

1266
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:33,995
<i>...sa benedica,</i>
gets put in the ground,

1267
01:25:34,078 --> 01:25:34,787
all they want to do
is eat my food.

1268
01:25:36,455 --> 01:25:39,083
It's not an Irish wake,
right, no food.

1269
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,168
You get carried to your car.

1270
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:42,003
Watch your step there, boss.

1271
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:48,551
- How you doing?
- How you been?

1272
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,474
Eckley,
how's the boy?

1273
01:25:55,558 --> 01:25:57,810
Wonder what they
talk about in there.

1274
01:26:06,986 --> 01:26:09,780
Uncle Dick, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1275
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,282
What's up, Joe Cocker?

1276
01:26:11,365 --> 01:26:13,701
All right, I'm gonna
wait in the car.

1277
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:15,578
You help her? Help her.

1278
01:26:15,661 --> 01:26:16,621
Well, spit it out.

1279
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:20,833
You ever heard of this?

1280
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:23,836
Yeah, so, what about it?

1281
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,922
Well, my mom's been
in a bad mood lately.

1282
01:26:26,005 --> 01:26:27,924
Lately?

1283
01:26:28,007 --> 01:26:31,469
The doctor said that this medicine
could help her, but she won't take it.

1284
01:26:31,552 --> 01:26:33,012
So what do you want from me?

1285
01:26:33,095 --> 01:26:36,265
So I was thinking maybe
you could talk to her.

1286
01:26:36,349 --> 01:26:37,725
What about your old man?

1287
01:26:37,808 --> 01:26:40,019
Nah, she's not speaking to him.
He did something.

1288
01:26:40,102 --> 01:26:41,938
I see the way
she looks at you.

1289
01:26:42,021 --> 01:26:44,190
Always sits
next to you at dinners.

1290
01:26:44,273 --> 01:26:46,317
She bought you that
fur hat for Christmas.

1291
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,110
I never wear it.

1292
01:26:48,194 --> 01:26:51,239
I mean... she looks up to you.

1293
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:53,449
And maybe you could
get her some.

1294
01:26:53,532 --> 01:26:54,617
You need a prescription.

1295
01:26:54,700 --> 01:26:55,910
I can't get it
in my own name.

1296
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:57,411
I know you can get anything.

1297
01:26:57,495 --> 01:26:58,788
Don't be a wise-ass.

1298
01:26:58,871 --> 01:27:01,791
I'm not, I'm just saying
it could make her happy.

1299
01:27:01,874 --> 01:27:03,084
Even Janice says.

1300
01:27:03,167 --> 01:27:04,460
Janice.

1301
01:27:04,544 --> 01:27:06,087
There's somebody we all
want to take advice from.

1302
01:27:08,339 --> 01:27:09,340
Anthony!

1303
01:27:10,424 --> 01:27:12,260
The pros play in the rain.

1304
01:27:14,303 --> 01:27:15,805
- Ah, what are you doing, Jun'?
- Uncle Jun'!

1305
01:27:19,558 --> 01:27:21,310
Oh, <i>Madonna mia!</i>

1306
01:27:21,394 --> 01:27:22,562
Stay down. Don't move him!

1307
01:27:22,645 --> 01:27:23,813
Uncle Jun'!

1308
01:27:23,896 --> 01:27:25,064
I just said
don't move him!

1309
01:27:26,607 --> 01:27:28,276
Your sister's cunt!

1310
01:27:28,359 --> 01:27:29,652
Corrado!

1311
01:27:29,735 --> 01:27:31,862
I'm calling an ambulance.
God damn it.

1312
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,823
Here you go. Here you go.

1313
01:27:33,906 --> 01:27:35,575
- Take my hand.
- Cocksucker!

1316

These are Frank Sinatra, Jr.
tickets for your uncle.

1317
01:27:58,931 --> 01:28:02,184
I gotta fly down
to the dog track.

1318
01:28:02,268 --> 01:28:05,354
<i>They boast a string

<i>the mighty Delfonics.</i>

1321
01:28:11,027 --> 01:28:14,697
Hey, kid.
How's your rash?

1322
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,240
Uncle Dickie around?

1323
01:28:20,995 --> 01:28:21,954
Hey.

1324
01:28:29,128 --> 01:28:30,087
Mezzanine?

1325
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:32,048
What the fuck.

1326
01:28:32,757 --> 01:28:33,716
What?

1327
01:28:34,508 --> 01:28:35,843
That medicine.

1328
01:28:35,926 --> 01:28:37,094
Oh...

1329
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:39,096
You nervous Nellie,
I got stuff to do.

1330
01:28:43,976 --> 01:28:45,728
Hey, hey, come here.

1331
01:28:45,811 --> 01:28:47,521
I want to show you something.

1332
01:28:55,404 --> 01:28:57,823
Holy shit. JBLs.

1333
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,536
A pair of them are yours
to take home.

1334
01:29:03,412 --> 01:29:05,581
Yeah, well, they're hot.

1335
01:29:05,664 --> 01:29:07,041
Eh, fell off a truck.

1336
01:29:07,833 --> 01:29:09,251
Far out, man.

1337
01:29:11,545 --> 01:29:13,339
Oh!

1338
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:14,465
Ten-inch woofers.

1339
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:18,844
I want to go to college.

1340
01:29:18,928 --> 01:29:20,596
I can't get caught
with shit like this.

1341
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:22,431
Okay, my friend Hesh...

1342
01:29:22,515 --> 01:29:25,601
says only goys
and children pay retail.

1343
01:29:25,684 --> 01:29:28,604
This isn't wholesale,
it's totally on the arm.

1344
01:29:31,857 --> 01:29:33,526
Look...

1345
01:29:33,609 --> 01:29:37,279
You want to be a civilian,
I appreciate that. I'm all for it.

1346
01:29:37,363 --> 01:29:39,532
But pay attention to me
for once, okay?

1347
01:29:39,615 --> 01:29:41,325
You take the speakers, right?

1348
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:44,912
At the same time, you promise
yourself these speakers are it.

1349
01:29:44,995 --> 01:29:46,580
Now, you say to yourself,

1350
01:29:46,664 --> 01:29:48,916
"This is the last time I'm
ever gonna steal something."

1351
01:29:48,999 --> 01:29:50,334
And you stick to it.

1352
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:54,422
It's that simple.

1353
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,031
Maybe... Maybe
I should get on top.

1354
01:30:35,504 --> 01:30:36,505
Agh!

1355
01:30:36,589 --> 01:30:40,176
Fucking Dickie Moltisanti!

1356
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:46,223
It's more than a month now!

1357
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:47,892
For God's sake, Corrado.

1358
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:50,853
He didn't push you down the
stairs, you slipped.

1359
01:30:50,936 --> 01:30:52,897
He got a good laugh
out of it, though.

1360
01:30:58,152 --> 01:31:00,196
Any excuse not to fuck.

1361
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:06,702
They don't vote the
motherfucker out of the White House,

1362
01:31:06,785 --> 01:31:09,371
somebody gonna
assassinate his lying ass.

1363
01:31:09,455 --> 01:31:11,499
Azalea, you got it!

1364
01:31:13,292 --> 01:31:15,085
Say, hey!

1365
01:31:15,169 --> 01:31:17,796
There's my farm boy
from the Garden State.

1366
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:19,381
Where's my tomatoes?

1367
01:31:19,465 --> 01:31:20,883
Brought you collard greens.

1368
01:31:20,966 --> 01:31:23,344
Ah, now you talkin'.

1369
01:31:25,221 --> 01:31:26,263
Sit down.

1370
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,933
Have a hot chocolate
and Baileys.

1371
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,142
So, we square?

1372
01:31:30,226 --> 01:31:32,144
Ooh, Chanel.

1373
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:38,234
Small bills.

1374
01:31:38,317 --> 01:31:39,610
You're doing good.

1375
01:31:39,693 --> 01:31:41,237
Soon I'll be in
the stratosphere with you.

1376
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:42,696
Call me Buzz Aldrin.

1377
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,449
Well, Buzz,
gonna hype you again.

1378
01:31:45,533 --> 01:31:47,201
State lottery's coming.

1379
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:50,246
Your woman's not gonna be wearing
French footwear very long.

1380
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:51,872
Now, with smack,

1381
01:31:51,956 --> 01:31:55,125
you got white kids coming in
from Long Island, New Jersey,

1382
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:57,294
Westchester
to the East Village,

1383
01:31:57,378 --> 01:32:00,673
paying 30 bucks to
stick their arm in a hole.

1384
01:32:00,756 --> 01:32:04,552
Invisible person on the
other side finds a vein,

1385
01:32:04,635 --> 01:32:05,886
shoots 'em up...

1386
01:32:07,763 --> 01:32:09,557
Should tell you something
about the future.

1387
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,059
You make a good point.
We'll talk.

1388
01:32:12,142 --> 01:32:12,977
Thanks.

1389
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,648
This week I gotta...

1390
01:32:17,731 --> 01:32:21,527
gotta do something about this
guinea motherfucker or he'll do me.

1391
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,362
Ah, DiMeo?

1392
01:32:23,445 --> 01:32:25,406
Nah, Dickie Moltisanti.

1393
01:32:26,949 --> 01:32:29,410
Controls the numbers,
whole rest of Newark.

1394
01:32:29,493 --> 01:32:31,787
You maybe need
an assist on the play?

1395
01:32:34,582 --> 01:32:37,126
Why would you want
to do that for me?

1396
01:32:37,209 --> 01:32:40,337
I got my own issues
with the Five Families.

1397
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:42,214
I appreciate it, Frank, but...

1398
01:32:43,299 --> 01:32:45,467
Terms of the community.

1399
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:47,344
I'd better do this myself.

1400
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:50,431
Darryl.

1401
01:32:57,146 --> 01:32:58,856

1414
01:34:07,966 --> 01:34:10,344
I got news.

1415
01:34:10,427 --> 01:34:13,806
That beauty parlor?
I took it over.

1416
01:34:15,933 --> 01:34:17,351
For me?

1417
01:34:17,434 --> 01:34:19,353
We'll be partners.

1418
01:34:19,436 --> 01:34:21,105
It'll be in my name,
but you'll run it.

1419
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:23,732
Exactly how you want it.
I'll be hands off.

1420
01:34:25,984 --> 01:34:28,362
Oh!

1421
01:34:30,155 --> 01:34:32,408

Hey, what did the bartender
say when the horse came in?

1435
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:28,088
"Why the long face?"

1436
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:31,049
You told me that
a million times.

1437
01:35:31,133 --> 01:35:34,052
Yeah, so?
Why the long face?

1438
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,347
I'm all, uh...

1439
01:35:38,098 --> 01:35:39,767
<i>intronata.</i>

1440
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:42,436
You're mixed up? Well,
what are you mixed up about?

1441
01:35:44,146 --> 01:35:45,814
So many things.

1442
01:35:45,898 --> 01:35:48,442
Ten minutes ago, you were laughing
like an idiot. What did I do?

1443
01:35:49,902 --> 01:35:51,737
The beauty parlor.

1444
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:52,821
The beaut...

1445
01:35:52,905 --> 01:35:54,698
I thought that's
what you wanted.

1446
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:57,159
More than anything.

1447
01:35:57,242 --> 01:35:59,745
But now we partners
in business.

1448
01:35:59,828 --> 01:36:01,663
It's like a marriage.

1449
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:07,461
I'm alone so much.

1450
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,381
I get lonely.

1451
01:36:13,509 --> 01:36:15,511
Maybe you didn't
love me anymore.

1452
01:36:15,594 --> 01:36:17,596
Hey, if I don't
love you anymore,

1453
01:36:17,679 --> 01:36:19,389
you won't mistake it
for a maybe.

1454
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:25,437
Someone else came along.

1455
01:36:30,984 --> 01:36:32,986
I said yes.

1456
01:36:35,614 --> 01:36:36,615
Who?

1457
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,118
Don't make me say.

1458
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,790
What, you said,
"Yes, come fuck me?"

1459
01:36:44,873 --> 01:36:47,125
Is that what you're trying to say?
What else, yes?

1460
01:36:47,209 --> 01:36:49,878
It didn't mean
anything, Dickie.

1461
01:36:49,962 --> 01:36:51,630
- I love you!
- How many times?

1462
01:36:51,713 --> 01:36:52,798
I don't know.

1463
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,341
You don't know?

1464
01:36:54,424 --> 01:36:56,176
So many times you can't remember?
Who was he?

1465
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,053
- I doesn't matter, it's over!
- Who was he?

1466
01:36:58,136 --> 01:37:00,347
- I can't!
- Tell me! Fucking tell me.

1467
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:01,598
Promise you won't hurt him!

1468
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:02,975
I don't promise anything,

1469
01:37:03,058 --> 01:37:04,309
but you don't tell me,
it's gonna be worse.

1470
01:37:06,436 --> 01:37:07,479
Harold.

1471
01:37:26,665 --> 01:37:28,584
You fucked that
murdering nigger?

1472
01:37:28,667 --> 01:37:30,836
But I don't
love him, Dickie!

1473
01:37:30,919 --> 01:37:33,672
I love you! Please! Don't!

1474
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,426
No, please! No! No!

1475
01:38:13,295 --> 01:38:14,254

One thing
I still miss at Christmas...

1481
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:36,169
The Seven Fishes.
My wife used to make it.

1482
01:39:36,253 --> 01:39:38,463
And tripe, too.

1483
01:39:38,547 --> 01:39:43,093
She could make those two
things, out of this world.

1484
01:39:43,176 --> 01:39:47,431
You celebrate Christmas with your
<i>goomar,</i> or you stick around home?

1485
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,392
What makes you ask?

1486
01:39:50,475 --> 01:39:53,729
I just remember, with my girlfriend,
it was always a big argument.

1487
01:39:57,274 --> 01:39:58,483
She died.

1488
01:40:01,653 --> 01:40:03,155
So young.

1489
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:06,867
What happened?

1490
01:40:07,743 --> 01:40:09,036
Pneumonia.

1491
01:40:09,661 --> 01:40:11,288
Pneumonia?

1492
01:40:11,371 --> 01:40:15,584
She had weak lungs,
from growing up on the other side.

1493
01:40:17,002 --> 01:40:18,712
Fucked up doctors...

1494
01:40:21,173 --> 01:40:23,467
So much tragedy
in your life.

1495
01:40:24,676 --> 01:40:27,345
Your father, your mistress...

1496
01:40:28,764 --> 01:40:30,599
I don't even have
a picture of her.

1497
01:40:36,396 --> 01:40:38,273
You know, I... I try so hard.

1498
01:40:41,026 --> 01:40:42,986
What kind of God, huh?

1499
01:40:47,032 --> 01:40:49,701
I go to church
when Joanne wants.

1500
01:40:49,785 --> 01:40:51,995
I try to set an example
for my nephew,

1501
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:53,038
I come see you...

1502
01:40:53,121 --> 01:40:54,831
I do all kinds of good things.

1503
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:59,252
You know the Christmas song,
"My Favorite Things"?

1504
01:41:00,128 --> 01:41:01,046
Yeah.

1505
01:41:02,339 --> 01:41:05,634
Maybe some of the things
you choose to do...

1506
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:08,095
aren't God's favorite.

1507
01:41:10,847 --> 01:41:12,933
What are you trying to say?

1508
01:41:14,392 --> 01:41:17,854
What do I know?
I'm a murderer.

1509
01:41:23,401 --> 01:41:25,821
As far as your nephew goes...

1510
01:41:25,904 --> 01:41:30,200
may I make a brief suggestion for a nice
Christmas present you could give him?

1511
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:35,372
I'm listening.

1512
01:41:37,249 --> 01:41:39,126
Stay out of his life.

1513
01:41:50,846 --> 01:41:52,013
It's damaged.

1514
01:41:52,097 --> 01:41:53,765
And you're out of line
with your prices.

1515
01:42:23,795 --> 01:42:25,130
<i>Who is this?</i>

1516
01:42:25,213 --> 01:42:28,008
Hey, Uncle Dick, it's Tony.
How's it going?

1517
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:31,386
There's a party tonight,
and I was wondering

1518
01:42:31,469 --> 01:42:33,763
if we could get a couple
cases of Rolling Rock?

1519
01:42:35,056 --> 01:42:36,224
Uncle Dick?

1520
01:42:39,227 --> 01:42:40,312
Uncle Dick?

1521
01:42:41,396 --> 01:42:42,230
Hello?

1522
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:47,068
There's something wrong
with his phone.

1523
01:42:47,152 --> 01:42:49,321
Your ass. Same as last time.

1524
01:42:50,906 --> 01:42:52,741
It doesn't have to be
Rolling Rock.

1525
01:42:52,824 --> 01:42:54,159
Does he know that?

1526
01:42:54,242 --> 01:42:56,620
It's not about
the fucking name brand.

1527
01:42:57,537 --> 01:42:58,955
Carmela, you got a dime?

1528
01:43:14,429 --> 01:43:15,305
<i>Hello?</i>

1529
01:43:15,388 --> 01:43:17,724
Hey, Aunt Jo. It's Tony.

1530
01:43:17,807 --> 01:43:19,226
Can I speak to Uncle Dick?

1531
01:43:20,852 --> 01:43:22,520
<i>I haven't seen him today.</i>

1532
01:43:22,604 --> 01:43:23,647
Yeah?

1533
01:43:25,982 --> 01:43:27,525
Well, how's Christopher?

1534
01:43:29,611 --> 01:43:31,529
You know, the colic?

1535
01:43:31,613 --> 01:43:34,032
<i>For my money, you kids shouldn't
be drinking at your age.</i>

1536
01:43:34,115 --> 01:43:36,243
<i>Give me</i>
<i>the goddamn phone.</i>

1537
01:43:44,459 --> 01:43:47,671
Fuck. Hey, Joe Jerk-off.

1538
01:43:51,925 --> 01:43:53,343
What'd you say?

1539
01:43:53,426 --> 01:43:55,053
I said, hey, Joe Jerk...

1540
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,096
Your sister's twat!

1541
01:43:56,179 --> 01:43:57,138
What?

1542
01:43:58,723 --> 01:43:59,599
Stop it!

1543
01:44:01,393 --> 01:44:02,269
Stop it!

1544
01:44:16,783 --> 01:44:18,159
What do you got for us?

1545
01:44:18,243 --> 01:44:20,495
It's what I told you,
furniture. Ethan Allen.

1546
01:44:20,578 --> 01:44:23,373
Dinette sets
and, uh, TV trays.

1547
01:44:24,332 --> 01:44:25,792
TV trays?

1548
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:27,210
I didn't argue.

1549
01:44:27,294 --> 01:44:30,171
- Mmm.
- Fucking truck's not gonna unload itself.

1550
01:44:33,591 --> 01:44:34,884
I'll let him know.

1551
01:44:45,937 --> 01:44:48,064
Hey, Sil, I need to talk
to my Uncle Dickie.

1552
01:44:49,232 --> 01:44:51,443
He's not here.

1553
01:44:51,526 --> 01:44:52,610
His car's here.

1554
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:54,696
Battery's dead.

1555
01:44:57,115 --> 01:44:59,117
You know where he is?

1556
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,036
Who am I, Rand McNally?

1557
01:45:06,374 --> 01:45:08,126
Okay, well...

1558
01:45:08,209 --> 01:45:09,627
Merry Christmas, Sil.

1559
01:45:12,255 --> 01:45:13,465
You too, kid.

1560
01:45:24,809 --> 01:45:30,190
Carmine spotted Harold,
Rockhaven Motel, down on 46th.

1561
01:45:33,485 --> 01:45:34,819
Well,
we'll do it tomorrow.

1562
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:38,490
I'll pick you up at 10:00
at the Pork Store.

1563
01:45:42,744 --> 01:45:45,622
It's the kid again.
I told him you're not here.

1564
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:49,876
Turn the lights out.

1565
01:45:51,503 --> 01:45:53,463
But the guys,
they're still unloading.

1566
01:46:39,801 --> 01:46:41,052
You know...

1567
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:29,809
The fuck are you doing?

1568
01:47:29,893 --> 01:47:31,519
I don't want these!

1569
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:40,487
Oh! That was a gift!

1570
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:41,571
You take 'em!

1571
01:47:41,654 --> 01:47:43,448
I don't want

1572
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:45,492
None of it! I don't
want any part of this!

1573
01:47:45,575 --> 01:47:48,328
Huh?
What "this"?

1574
01:47:50,872 --> 01:47:52,207
What "this"?

1575
01:47:58,922 --> 01:48:00,381
Night, Dick.

1576
01:48:09,349 --> 01:48:10,725
Dick...

1577
01:48:10,808 --> 01:48:13,853
The kid. I don't know
what happened with you two.

1578
01:48:14,812 --> 01:48:16,564
But he worships you.

1579
01:48:16,648 --> 01:48:18,274
He's got so much potential.

1580
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:21,611
Anthony, with that
loony tune of a mother.

1581
01:48:21,694 --> 01:48:24,572
Johnny, who's in line
for a personality transplant...

1582
01:48:24,656 --> 01:48:26,366
- What, I'm some kind of example?
- What can I tell you?

1583
01:48:26,449 --> 01:48:27,742
You're his best shot.

1584
01:48:27,825 --> 01:48:29,994
Ah, I should never
have let this happen.

1585
01:48:31,454 --> 01:48:32,580
Get in close.

1586
01:48:32,664 --> 01:48:34,624
Dick, he misses you.

1587
01:48:37,502 --> 01:48:38,336
What?

1588
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:42,090
Nothing.

1589
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:47,220
Actually...

1590
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:49,806
that's it.

1591
01:48:56,354 --> 01:48:57,397
Nothing.

1592
01:48:59,816 --> 01:49:01,359
I'm not sure I follow.

1593
01:49:02,860 --> 01:49:04,153
Yeah, well.

1594
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:05,697
Okay.

1595
01:49:07,365 --> 01:49:10,034
I know I shouldn't
say this, but...

1596
01:49:10,118 --> 01:49:12,453
Anthony, he could
end up somewhere.

1597
01:49:12,537 --> 01:49:14,080
Be on this thing of ours, even.

1598
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:28,011
Tell him Holsten's, tomorrow.

1599
01:49:28,094 --> 01:49:30,597
- There you go.
- Let me finish, for Christ's sake!

1600
01:49:33,641 --> 01:49:35,685
9:00 a.m. No later.

1601

1602
01:49:37,895 --> 01:49:38,938
Okay.

1603
01:49:39,022 --> 01:49:40,690
- It's all right, but it...
- Okay!

1604
01:49:40,773 --> 01:49:42,108
It's over, go home.

1605
01:49:44,068 --> 01:49:45,403
