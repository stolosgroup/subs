extermination of Serbs, Jews and Romani on its Territory.

7
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:01,146
It was the only one of its kind in Europe run by
the Germans and the only one that had camps

8
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:04,758

00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,333
Why they don't take those women to?

11
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,002
Because they are not Serbs.

12
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:00,969

13
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,287
Croats.

14
00:02:02,972 --> 00:02:05,524
But how they know who is who ? They are the same as we are.

15
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:07,810
Because we cross like this

16
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,528

19
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:13,882
Why he didn’t told me?

20
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,334

00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,239
No need for that.

25
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,125
Just don't separate. Dara, did you hear me.

26
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:36,004
Do not watch over there.

27
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,439
This is a sin.

28
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,608

00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,961
They were ail killed latter.

172
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,481
Or they catched and moved him in Gradina.

173
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,566
I heard about Gradina..

174
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,802
Nobody went alive from there.

175
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,774
We need to save the children's.

176
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,526
Help me to turn her around.

177
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:02,203
Vera, lie on your side.

178
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,733
What she said about Grada. Is my father there ?

179
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,085
I told you not to listen everybody.

180
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,644
I don't know what will happen to us either.

181
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,847
I beg you one thing..

182
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,801
Whatever happens, you must be brave.

183
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,054
You are big girl.

184
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:56,974

Listen here.

188
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:21,399
While music plays, you run arount chairs.

189
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:29,039
When commander raise hand music stops, you sit on nearby chair.

190
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:35,045
The one who succeeds in that, get's a second chance.

191
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,369
Let start with, Serbian folk music.

192
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,163
- Here it starts !
- Let me do it... Raise her.

193
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:15,319
Jovo ! Get up with childrens and take them out, hurry !

194
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,524

Push.

196
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,885
You must do it harder.

197
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,013
Push harder c'mon !

198

202
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,159
Maybe it's better like that.

203
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,959
Corne, corne. Corne.

204
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,252

00:29:13,802 --> 00:29:14,601
Run !

207
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,032
Welcome to Balkan.

208
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,827
What is ? Kid feels sick ?

209
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:02,065
Yes, the roads on Balkans are fuII of curves.

210
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,837
We will make roads like you. Highway !

211
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,106
As soon as this ends.

212
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,876
You mean, after you kill all Serbs ?

213
00:30:13,761 --> 00:30:16,029
Why do you spent so much energy on them ?

214
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,666
Did we agreed only Jews and Roma ? Why Serbs ?

215
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:24,104
Because they are Serbs.

216
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,190
Excuse me.
H3BMHHTe Me.

217
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,924
Stjepa !

218
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,480

219
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,450
MUCH FASTER !

220
00:31:57,765 --> 00:31:59,166
Let's move back.

221
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,601
No mother belly. She gave birth.

222
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,087
Where is child ?

223
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:28,495
Taken away.

224
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,649
Same as father take away one of ours, when mother once gave birth.

225
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,334
Where was taken ?

226
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,055
Somewhere, where they take little children into a place that is nice and warm.

227
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,007
So l'm not getting a sister ?

228
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:41,525
You will not.

229
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,529
Your mother will get a syster once we get out of here.

230
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,967
Where are you going now ? see a mother and how is she.

231
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,970
Leave her now. Corne here.

232
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:21,682
I don't know why we dig this much when Sava river floods everything..

233
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,571
You burry them, thinking that you burried them and then watter throws them up.

234
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,925
I used to love that river while i wass passing...

235
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,245
Now i cannot see her with my eyes.

236
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:37,814
It's a tomb.

237
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:47,574
Did someone tried to flee ? -There is no exit from here.

238
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,247
Which way did they go ?
-There, right.

239
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,087
Across the river, huh ?

240
00:34:00,922 --> 00:34:04,574
I don't know even one that saved himself. Don't even think about it.

241
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:08,245
There's to many of them. Them and Germans.

242
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:13,250
I cannot wait dead just like that. -Well, do not push it either.

243
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:14,968

244
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,283
Do you feel better, mother ? -A little.

245
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:33,053
I was in fear that you will die.

246
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:37,724
Don't, son..

247
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,248
1'11 find something to fix it. To put pressure on it.

248
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,204
Jovo, let's get boys out.

249

He doesn't look like that !

Sleep peacefully son Jovo. Now nobody will touch you now.

00:41:15,256 --> 00:41:19,809
If you meet up there mine Avram, or mine David or Jakov...

00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:13,612

01:00:45,491 --> 01:00:49,444
Don't, they will catch you !
I cannot watch my daughters hungry.

448
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,814
I don't care if they kill me.
I will grind corn with stone.

449
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:55,801
You better return that.

450
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,012
It seems that us stronger women will be taken to work in Germany.

451
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:07,879
When ?

452
01:01:08,681 --> 01:01:10,082
It can happen every day.

453
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:11,533
What about the children ?

454
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:14,202
What will happend to my children ?

455
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,440
There are some women from Zagreb. They're taking the kids out of here.

456
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:20,175
One told me, they take her child.

457
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,160
Where they take them ?
-Into safety.

458
01:01:22,362 --> 01:01:24,413
Where ? -Who knows.

459
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:29,484
They put some of them in orphanage. Some are placed into their families.

460
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:32,921
Some of them they convert in their faith. -They lead them to death !

461
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:35,841
I don’t believe in nothing of that ! -But on this here you believe ! ?

462
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:37,893
I will give mine.

463

Do that faster.

Finish your work !

466
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:54,159
I cannot give children's like that, into the unknown.

467
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,361
What if they take us away tomorow ?

468
01:01:56,362 --> 01:01:58,163
To whom to leave them ?

469
01:01:58,564 --> 01:02:01,883
This is a camp of death. There is no exit from here.

470
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:07,639
Further.

471
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,245

473
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,202
That's all ?

474

Hands up. Move on.

479
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,200
Lift up your skirt.

480
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,607
Raise your hands.

481
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,962
What is this ?

482
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:08,650
What is this... ! ?
You know how high punishments are.

483
01:03:09,936 --> 01:03:11,653

Run away from her. -Why ? Just run.

499
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:43,405
Did someone asked you something.. About children ? -No.

500
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,408

Take care of them, as long as you can.

505
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:06,494
If someone appears, while I am gone.. Some womens.

506
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,215
They take away children's into safety.

507
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:19,491
Let them go. We can give Buda to.

01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,093
Aunte Vera, I can't. -Dara, you must.

517
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:05,403
Maybe they take you to. -Where ? As far away from here as possible.

518
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,973
Go to sleep.

519
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,325

If some of you doesn't respond immediately after i read the name, will be killed right away.

526
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:53,051
What about our children's ?

01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,924
I am from Stara Gradiska.

649
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,730
Stara Gradiska ? -Yes.

650
01:18:57,048 --> 01:18:58,682
How long from here to Stara Gradiska ?

651
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,650
It has...

652
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:03,454
..about 30 km..Downstream.

653
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:06,040
On what side of Sava river ? -Over it.

654
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:07,525
Is there a some mill ?

655
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:08,926
It has...

656
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:12,363
near on the river side..

657
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:15,249
They emptied everything there, for women and children.

658
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,968
There was no room for them in Gradiska prison anymore.

659
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,921
Some organisation came, and..

660
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,925
...Ljubo Milos ordered everything to be emptied in three days.

661
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:28,329
My dear mother...So many people were killed that day..

662
01:19:28,814 --> 01:19:31,165
My two children were stayed alive there.

663
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:36,654
My woman and older son....are killed.

664
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,807
But i found them here.

665
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:49,967
Me to...all mine.

666
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,974
You don't hגve nobody ? -Nobody.

667
01:20:02,247 --> 01:20:05,082
I must try to escape. -Don’t. I must.

668
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:07,201
Don't. Whoever tried, they killed him.

669
01:20:07,252 --> 01:20:09,003
If not them, they were killed by river Sava.

670
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:10,855
It cannot be debated.

671
01:20:12,324 --> 01:20:16,694
Even if you suceed, they are on the other side to.

672
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,806
When they brought again on the Sava...

673
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:35,963
..better that, than found them dead to. Better..

674
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:33,971
You must no cry.

675
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:39,727
Brana, you are the oldest one. Take care of your syster.

676
01:21:40,245 --> 01:21:49,403
Even if they separate you, remember your names, from where you are and name of your mother. Corne on.

677
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:52,573
Corne on, you heard. You must go.

678
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,575
What i gave i gave.

679
01:21:55,126 --> 01:21:57,611
As if there is no Croatian children who need help.

680
01:21:57,963 --> 01:22:01,081
Pardon me but, we hגve ail papers ! Ministers approved it to !

681
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,601
I don't care about your papers and ministers.

682
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:07,171
How many of our childrens need glass of milk ! ?

683
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:11,292
When can we go ? -As soon as possible ! Only not to look at you.

684
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:15,045
Take my child to, please ! -Give her..

685
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:16,563
Dijana please. -CAN NOT ! RUN AWAY !

686
01:22:16,615 --> 01:22:17,648
Let me... I deserve it.

687
01:22:17,682 --> 01:22:18,399
GET AWAY !

688
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:21,402
AWAY WITH THEM !

689
01:22:25,323 --> 01:22:28,292
Please hurry. The children must leave as soon as possible.

690
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,560
Take care of them, please.

691
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:32,246
Do not worry. We will list them ail. They will know where they are.

692
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:34,081
C'mon, hurry up.

693
01:22:36,334 --> 01:22:38,686
May God thank you. -Hurry up.

694
01:22:43,008 --> 01:22:45,409
Let's go.. Faster...

695
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:59,606

700
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:41,809
Why you didn't report him ? Maybe they would take him.

701
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,445
I can’t.

702
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,248
Do you see that he is not well ?

703
01:24:55,690 --> 01:25:00,127
What's wrong Buda ? Why are you so sick of ?

704
01:25:30,842 --> 01:25:35,729
Don't even think about it. You wouldn't even reach to the river. They would kill you.

705
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,331
Let's dig, corne on.

706
01:25:59,003 --> 01:26:02,439
What is wrong with him ? -I don't know.

707
01:26:05,043 --> 01:26:08,729
It is like he's burning. He is hungry.

708
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,853
Corne on, take it.

709
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:24,011
Corne on. Give it to him.

710
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:30,200
If he's not well, they'll take him to the hospital.

711
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:32,252
He will be good.

712
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,121
Dara...

713
01:26:35,173 --> 01:26:40,327
...if some child is not well, they blגme I am responsible for you.

714
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:43,764
He will be good. He's strong.

01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:06,253
What is that ! ? -He is not well.

719

Are you crazy ? Do you want us to get an infection here ! ? -No.

720
01:27:09,574 --> 01:27:11,725
Move him to the hospital right now.

721
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:20,684
He is not for hospital anymore. -He is still alive.

722
01:27:21,085 --> 01:27:22,002
Move him.

723

-I just came, didn't saw everybody.

Where did you go ?
¦To help women who wash.

725
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:35,082
It is good. You wan't to work.

726
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:36,883
It should be that way.

727
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,487
Go to yard. Report to clean up.

728
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:48,812
You listen to me good. Take care of everything.

729
01:27:49,364 --> 01:27:54,451
If infection emerge,
I will judge you personally.

01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:57,254
Take him away. I understand.

He look sick. -Nothing wrong with him. That is not your bussines Dusanka.

01:28:57,215 --> 01:28:59,966

Nun is not there tomorow.

809
01:36:47,852 --> 01:36:51,521
Guard replacement is before dawn. Nobody is there.

810
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:03,493
Here he is.

811
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:10,567
My love ! Sister came to see you.

812
01:38:14,255 --> 01:38:19,008
Did you missed me ? I missed you.

813
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,731
Look what I brought to you.

814
01:38:25,616 --> 01:38:29,085
You forgot apple. Do you want to eat it now ?

815
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,721
You must eat.

816
01:38:46,053 --> 01:38:49,689
Here for you some. -I will leave it for later..

817
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:03,002
You must go now Dara, the guard will corne.

818
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:06,889
Corne in the evening, they will change then. Now you must go.

819
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:10,526
You must stay here for a while. Untill you recover.

820
01:39:11,762 --> 01:39:14,163
We will see each other again later..

821
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:16,366
Who is that ? What she doing here ! ?

822
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:18,167
She will help us from now on.

823
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:20,520
Let's go Dara, we need to set cauldrons on fire.

824
01:39:20,804 --> 01:39:22,288
I will change bead sheets later.

825
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:23,206
Brankica..

826
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,894
Bring me the tea. -Right away.

827
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:35,201
Be well Buda. -Let's go Dara.

828
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:55,855
Is your brother alive ? -Like you care.

829
01:39:57,374 --> 01:40:00,043
He is sick.. He is alive.

830
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:05,415
Two of mine died here. Dusanka is the only one left.

831
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:09,719
God grant that one day you will be a mother to.

832
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:13,606
Leave me alone. You hגve no sol.

833
01:40:15,693 --> 01:40:17,010
I hגve.

834
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:06,609
FOR THE HOMELAND PREPARED ! FOR HOMELAND !

835
01:41:13,684 --> 01:41:16,169
Dear Cr°a‘S

836
01:41:17,571 --> 01:41:19,205
Young Ustashas,

837
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:22,091
Croatian sons

838
01:41:23,894 --> 01:41:26,446
We need to build a Croatian State foryou.

839
01:41:27,531 --> 01:41:30,399
For our children 's, without burgain of guilt.

840
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:36,489
Foryoung people who want to capture the power of Croatian history in their wings.

841
01:41:37,574 --> 01:41:39,725
It will be a painfull operation.

842
01:41:40,444 --> 01:41:42,845
Because that will be a exam of maturity.

843
01:41:43,447 --> 01:41:46,766
It will be a test of our love for Croatia.

844
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:50,369
It will be a painfull operation.

845
01:41:51,321 --> 01:41:53,439
We must think about that Croatia,

846
01:41:53,724 --> 01:41:55,925
..that will be in year 2000...

847
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:59,729
When ail of us older, became rotten in grave.

848
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:03,049
We consider this planned work for long period.

849
01:42:03,767 --> 01:42:05,802
In addition to our traditional properties,

850
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:08,054
Big hart,

851
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:10,123
Combativeness,

852
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:12,525
Spirituality of libיration,

853
01:42:13,727 --> 01:42:16,779
We need to insert a dose of rationality.

854
01:42:17,614 --> 01:42:18,965
Collective responsibility,

855
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,483
Collective work,

856
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:23,486
Collective political conscience,

857
01:42:24,087 --> 01:42:27,240
Which we Croats, almost always missed.

858
01:42:27,925 --> 01:42:31,093
With that way we would build one political doctrine,

859
01:42:31,929 --> 01:42:38,367
That could be valuable today, as it could be valuable in the year of 2000.

860
01:42:39,253 --> 01:42:40,369
And that is..

861
01:42:41,889 --> 01:42:44,807
Always to base everything on eternal foundations.

862
01:42:45,776 --> 01:42:47,493
To those that is unchangeable.

863
01:42:48,095 --> 01:42:51,447
In trust in God, creator of Earth and the sky

864
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:53,533
In your Croatian people.

865
01:42:54,535 --> 01:42:56,252
If we work like that,

866
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:58,771
Than, not even the hell's power,

867
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:03,326
...or the power of any universal idea, will not break us,

868
01:43:04,094 --> 01:43:05,244
..but we will like one,

869
01:43:05,562 --> 01:43:06,679
...intelligent,

870
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:08,414
...biologically healthy,

871
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:11,284
Mentally advanced and capable people,

872
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:14,720
..in ail oportunities knowing to choose one road,

873
01:43:16,056 --> 01:43:26,365
Incomprיhensible

874
01:43:26,850 --> 01:43:31,721
Laws, borders and rights of the citizents of Croatia.

875
01:43:32,806 --> 01:43:36,042
To all of you, young ustashas,

876
01:43:36,526 --> 01:43:38,244
Today and always...

877
01:43:38,562 --> 01:43:41,614
Jet it remain for you to be a servants of your homeland,

878
01:43:41,682 --> 01:43:45,484
On the borders of Croatian State to river Drina.

879
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:48,571
So, may God help you !

880
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:50,773
You're that one ?

881
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:55,895
Son, you just do your job.

882
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,168
Long live Croatian people !

883
01:44:03,203 --> 01:44:06,572
Long live Indיpendant State of Croatia !

884
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:08,174
To live long !

885
01:44:12,963 --> 01:44:14,614
Let's go, applause.

886
01:44:15,082 --> 01:44:16,215
Wawe !

887
01:44:19,653 --> 01:44:20,486
Wave.

888
01:44:45,128 --> 01:44:45,895
Youth,

889
01:44:47,881 --> 01:44:49,532
Croatian heroes.

890
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,734
Let’s take picture.

891
01:44:58,575 --> 01:44:59,692
Smile.

892
01:45:16,526 --> 01:45:17,493
Ante.

893
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:19,605
When will they take us on Sava again ?

894
01:46:20,574 --> 01:46:24,410
We will go when they dיcidי to drown Serbs downstream the river..

895
01:46:24,611 --> 01:46:26,095
Ail the way up to the Belgrade..

896
01:46:27,531 --> 01:46:31,450
Please stop thinking about running away, I beg you like a God.

897
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:36,922
To what should i think ?

898
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:42,411
To what ?

899
01:46:48,001 --> 01:46:50,719
..and that is how grandma drove away the wolf.

900
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,406
Terrible wolf...

901
01:46:54,091 --> 01:46:55,808
...who runs into wood,

902
01:46:56,693 --> 01:46:58,928
...to never corne back again.

903
01:47:00,447 --> 01:47:03,482
..and than grandma goes to sleep.

904
01:47:05,051 --> 01:47:06,519
She fell asleep.

905
01:47:08,655 --> 01:47:10,890
Now you will sleep to..

906
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:13,642

Hide down fast !

908

We should really put this in order a little bit.

909
01:47:37,367 --> 01:47:42,371
Tomorrow we will hגve those women from Red Cross. They are coming into inspection.

910
01:47:42,973 --> 01:47:44,773
They are complaining ail the time.

911
01:47:44,891 --> 01:47:49,361
Well, if there is no hospital, there will be no complainings.

912
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:54,567
Do you hגve a bassement here ? -It's there.

913
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:06,562
Great. Listen up ! Put here ail weak and jews if some is here, put them down to.

Stjepan, prepare everything and tell me when is finished. You please tell me...

915
01:48:11,134 --> 01:48:17,206
Did you cook something for a dinner ? Pork CTeaK with potatoes, just like you love.

916
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:23,212
What's wrong with you two, did you hear the order ? -Yes we are. Let's go.

Go into storage room. Hold him, faster. Go.

01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,560
Corne on, out of here.

01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:05,334
Here you're hidding.. Smart kid.

923
01:52:09,055 --> 01:52:14,843
Listen Daro, those women who are carrying children will corne from Zagreb tomorrow.

924
01:52:15,612 --> 01:52:16,929
You must give him.

925
01:52:18,014 --> 01:52:22,284
can’t... - You hגve to. Or they'll take him to the hospital right away.

926
01:52:22,802 --> 01:52:25,003
He wilI end up like those children before.

927
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:32,895
One girl that was on the list was killed in the bassement.

928
01:52:34,047 --> 01:52:36,999
I hגve her number so, we can try him with that number.

929
01:52:39,285 --> 01:52:40,369
Can i go with him ?

930
01:52:42,605 --> 01:52:46,842
You can't. There is no way.
I can't allow to be separated from him.

931
01:52:47,043 --> 01:52:54,333
Dara, even if you go, when they start giving you to houses, they will separate you for sure.

932
01:52:57,053 --> 01:53:02,040
Trust me. This is the only salvation for him.

933
01:53:05,528 --> 01:53:08,363
Neither you or me can save him forever.

934
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,368
Corne on. Do you hגve something to mask him as a girl ?

935
01:53:13,686 --> 01:53:18,607
Mileva left me some of her daughters. There is a dress. -Where ?

936
01:53:20,009 --> 01:53:22,728
There is a bag, where i lay.

937
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:42,080

01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:06,522
Your syster doesn't leave you my love.

941
01:54:09,125 --> 01:54:14,363
You're beautiful... Like some girl.

942
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:21,169

963
01:56:40,526 --> 01:56:42,160
Wait a little bit more.
-The time is up. It must...

964
01:56:45,882 --> 01:56:46,848
That's him.
