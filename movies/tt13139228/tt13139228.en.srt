You did quite well.

- Yes?

You being a teacher,

Do you think you could
recommend some books to me?

- In exchange,

195
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,500
I could give you more swimming lessons.

00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,250

You mean books about art?

201

I never really looked at art before.

Now I think I could
get something out of it.

Well, that's a start.

00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,125
We just stopped talking about it.

494
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,916
I don't want to hear another word.

495
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,041
- Are we playing or not?
- (grunts)

496
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,416
How did this happen?!

497
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,416
(whispers):
Bloody hell.

498
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,976
I was supposed to be married with
all the good things that come with that.

499
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,416
Now look-look at me.

500
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,333
There's no passion.

TOM: Everything was fine
until you brought him here.

502
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,208
MARION: Things haven't been fine
for quite a while,

503
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,500
and if we don't try
to fix it or at least...

504
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,916
Wh-Where are you going?

505
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,666
- TOM: The pub for some peace.
- And-and what do I do, Tom?

506
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,500
How do I find some peace?

507
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,750
- Send him away.
- No!

508
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,541
You want him gone, you do it.

00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,708
- Yes?
- There's been an accident.

515
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,208
An old lady on her bicycle.
Could you come quickly, please?

516
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,041
PATRICK:
Finding a policeman

517
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,958
was not something I ever thought

Not much of an accident, was it?

00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:32,875
I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you.

00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,666
Oh, no bother at all, sir.

526
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,541
You did the right thing.

527
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:39,291
Besides, you never know

Let me give you my card.

PATRICK:
I've never had much patience

533
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,916
with our boys in blue.

534
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,833
I've always despised
their brutish little ways.

535
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,041
The evaluating glance up and down.

536
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,125
The distaste they cannot hide.

537
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,791
(speaks indistinctly, laughs)

538
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,500
But this boy is different.

539
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,041
His eyes lit up when he saw my card.

540
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,458
You work at the museum?

541
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,625
PATRICK: Said he'd never been
to Brighton's most noble institution,

542
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,625
even on a school trip.

543
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,041
I had the measles.

544
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,250
- Oh, dear.
- (laughs)

545
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,000
PATRICK: I invited him
to visit the museum as my guest.

546
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,291
You're welcome.

547
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,000
PATRICK:
He seemed interested.

548
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,500
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about him.

549
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,958
He's handsome, yes.

550
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,791
But there's something else.

551
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:40,625
Innocence combined with a curiosity.

552
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:47,250
I'd like to draw him,
but I wonder if he'd misunderstand.

553
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,666
I'd almost forgotten that
some people are still innocent.

554
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,833
- Mr. Hazel wood.
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,291
An officer's here asking for you.

556
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,625
Tell him he'll have to wait.

557
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,250
He's rather handsome for a copper.

558
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,958
PATRICK:
There he was.

559
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,250
I recognized him even from behind.

560
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,125
That fine head.

561
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,916
The unmistakable line of his shoulder.

562
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,625
TOM:
Now, that's a good painting.

563
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,458
PATRICK:
In fact, it's a masterpiece.

564
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:50,666
See? I must have
some taste for art after all.

565
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:56,291
Taste is simply just knowing
how something makes you feel.

566
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,416
So how does it make you feel?

567
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,458
You can sense the waves.

568
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,541
You know, how strong they are.

569
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,583
Like swimming in rough surf.

570
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:15,500
- Exciting.
- Mm.

571
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:19,958
And frightening.

572
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,250
Right.

573
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,309
Don't tell the boys down the station
I'm afraid of a painting.

574
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,375
(both laugh)

575
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,291
You know, I'm an amateur artist.

576
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,791
You paint?

577
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,500
Pencil drawings mostly.

578
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,333
Studies of ordinary Brighton people,

579
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,083
a tram conductor, a barman,
that sort of thing.

580
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,333
You'd make a perfect subject.

581

Me?

582

Never been asked to model before.

Oh, there's nothing to it.

584
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,625
But I wouldn't mind
learning more about paintings.

585
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,666
Art, I mean.

586

Well, that's admirable.

00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,000
Is it? Why?

588
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:17,750
Because a man should always

I assumed you didn't want me to say that

602
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,958
you're a police officer coming
to have your portrait drawn.

Nothing wrong with that, is there?

- Nice place.
- Thank you.

605
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,583
I brought my uniform,

606
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,666
in case you want me in it
for the portrait.

607
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,000
Yes, yes. That will do nicely.

608
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:24,916
Well, then, why don't, uh... you change.

- Yeah, I think so.
- Try to keep the pose.

Oh. Sorry.

613
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,458
I think so.

00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,083
Is this part of the procedure?

00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,458
I can't draw you

Um...

619
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,750
I like knowing I'm doing
something for the public.

620
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,541
You know, protecting people.

621

If that's your ambition,
I give you more credit

622

623
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,041
How so?

624
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,333
You seem more...

625
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:53,333
...open-minded than
the police I've run across.

626
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,000
- Do I?
- Oh, yes.

627
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,208
I tend to keep my distance
from the police in general.

628
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:04,000
There's no reason to fear a police officer
if you stay on the right side of the law.

629
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,125
Of course. I-I...

630
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,059
It's the criminal element
that causes the trouble.

631

We just have to deal with it.

I don't know if this is a good...

I haven't offered you a drink.
Would you like something?

Um...

Please, beer if you've got it.

636
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,208
Don't have any beer. Uh...

637
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,451
How about something stronger?

638
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,416
I'm going to have a Scotch.

639
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:31,833
How about you, Officer Burgess?

640
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,916

Oi! Stop where you are,

645
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,750
What? What? Am I that ridiculous?

646
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,291
I'm sorry, but "hooligan"?

- Mm.

- And the material's coarse.
- Yeah, like me. (Laughs)

No, not at all like you.

01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:34,958
Asking about next time.

991
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,500
Do you know how long it's been
since we saw each other last?

992
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,833
How many days?

993
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:46,583
I better go.

994
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:51,166
Please, please, just...
just a few more minutes.

995
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,916
Marion expects me home after my shift.

996
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,000
One more minute.

997
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,708
She wants to have a baby.

998
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,875
You'll make a wonderful father.

999
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:13,000
I have something for you.

1000
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,208
A present.

1001
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:29,500
TOM:
Guide to Venice.

1002
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:32,458
I'm going next month on museum business.

1003
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,250
Why don't you come with me?

1004
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:38,958
To Venice?

1005
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,791
Just you and I.

1006
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:45,208
No checking the time and rushing off.

1007
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:48,791
No hiding.

1008
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:51,916
No lies.

1009
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,851
- Wouldn't you enjoy that?
- Patrick, I'm married.

1010
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,625
Yeah, but even a married man has
the right to travel, doesn't he?

1011
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:01,416
I mean, some men go on fishing trips
with their friends.

1012
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,833
Yeah, a man ought to take his wife
on a holiday

1013
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:05,250
before he goes off with a mate.

1014
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,333
No, but this isn't a holiday.

1015
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:11,375
The museum is paying for an assistant,

1016
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:15,083
and I'm offering the position to you.

1017
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,583
A real position?

1018
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,625
It pays 35 pounds.

1019
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:23,250
- That's almost what I make in a month.
- Good.

1020
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,375
Well, I'll book us a suite
in one of my favorite hotels.

1021
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,083
And what would I tell Marion?

1022
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,833
- Patrick, I can't.
- Then I'll do it.

1023
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:33,916
I'll tell her.

1024
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:42,125
You mustn't hurt her, Patrick.

1025
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:47,000
She really is a wonderful person.

1026
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,416
- (kids chattering)
- PATRICK: Follow me, please.

1027
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:54,375
(Patrick continues indistinctly)

1028
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,041
PATRICK:
Dance, go to the picture house,

1029
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,416
or you can watch Punch and Judy
on the pier.

1030
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,625
And that is art... music inspires us

1031
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:03,875
just like every single painting
in this gallery.

1032
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,250
Right. Did you enjoy yourselves?

1033
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,416
KIDS:
Yes.

1034
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,583
Yes? Good, good.

1035
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:10,458
Now, Miss Stewart here

1036
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,000
will give each of you
a lollipop, all right?

1037
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,458
Goodbye, now.

1038
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:17,708
Oh, it's been such a delightful day.

1039
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,309
The children have
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

1040
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,653
I better get them back to school.

1041
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:26,750
Oh, I, uh... plan to put Tom
to work, you know.

1042
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,000
On what?

1043
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:29,643
Yes, the assistant curator couldn't go.

1044
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:31,541
I almost had to cancel
before Tom stepped in

1045
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,000
at the last minute and saved my neck.

1046
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,923
- I'm sorry, I-I don't...
- Our trip to Venice.

1047
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:41,500
Tom's gonna be my assistant
while I pick up some new pieces.

1048
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,375
There'll be so much to pack up
and cart to the station.

1049
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,250
He'll do a splendid job.

1050
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,416
And I've seen to it that he'll be
handsomely compensated.

1051
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,583
Hasn't he mentioned it?

1052
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:55,083
Of course.

1053
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,583
Well, thanks for being a sport about it.

1054
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,000
Certainly.

but it's the kindest thing I can do.

And it'll be better for both of you
if you accept that.

DEFENSE COUNSEL:
And during that visit,

1214
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:02,875
did you have any reason
to believe that Mr. Hazel wood

1215
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,458
was a danger to your pupils

1216
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:08,791
or in any way
a negative influence on them?

1217
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,083
On the contrary, the children loved him.

1218
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:16,250
Do you believe that
Mr. Hazel wood is capable

1219
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,750
of performing the acts
with which he stands accused?

1220
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,875
Namely, gross indecency
in a public convenience

1221
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,791
and endangering public morals.

1222

No.

in another capacity?

1227
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:39,916
Other than professional.

1228
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,583
Yes.

1229
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,500
He is a friend.

1230
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:48,875
A close friend
of your husband's, is he not?

1231
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,750
My husband and I
both consider him a friend.

1232
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,708
But he and your husband
are particularly close.

1233
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:55,458
Isn't that true?

1234
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:58,375
So close they recently traveled
to Italy together.

1235
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:00,250
Patrick had business there.

1236
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:02,416
Did your husband have business there?

1237
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,708
He was assisting him.

1238
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:05,500
Assisting?

1239
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,416
Yes.

1240
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:11,333
Mrs. Burgess, I'd like to read an extract

1241
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,833
from one of Patrick Hazelwood's diaries.

1242
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:16,458
These were collected in his apartment
when he was arrested.

1243
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,875
Some of it is rather purple, I'm afraid.

1244
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:24,291
This is from a page dated
31st of July, 1957.

1245
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:28,416
"I recognized him even from behind.

1246
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,166
"That fine head.

1247
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,833
"The unmistakable line of his shoulder.

1248
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:37,416
My policeman was magnificently alive
in front of me."

1249
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,541
Mrs. Burgess, who is "my policeman"?

01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:45,333

PROSECUTOR: Perhaps another extract
will help you remember.

the schoolteacher.

"Yesterday, he brought her to the museum.

1257

"She's instinctively possessive.

"on those same shoulders the night before,

1261

as my policeman and I..."
