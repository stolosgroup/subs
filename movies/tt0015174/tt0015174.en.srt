in any complete German version,

5
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:34,084
whether by way
of any extant release print,

6
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,334
or anything struck
from an original camera negative.

7
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:39,459
This photochemical restoration is based
on incomplete camera negatives.

8
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:42,251
Missing sections were supplemented
by various extant prints of the period

9
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,792
along with archival copies.

10
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,292
Colouration follows the conventional
method of then-contemporary prints,

11
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:50,334
and is based upon
original tinting technique:

12
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,959
the production of a B&W print,

13
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:54,084
with subsequent staining
performed in a dye-bath.

14
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:56,917
The German intertitles were taken
from extant prints and flash-titles

15
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:58,626
restored digitally from the negatives.

16
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,542
Missing titles
that have been reconstructed

17
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:02,292
are designated
by the Murnau-Stiftung logo.

18
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:07,792
For this HD mastering,
the image has been corrected in places,

19
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:12,251
and heavy damage
to the film has been retouched.

<i>KRIEMHILD'S REVENGE</i>

54
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:59,126
The First Canto:

55
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:03,126
How Kriemhild Mourned Siegfried,

56
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,042
and How Kצnig Etzel (King Attila)
Courted Her

57
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:10,959
Through Rdiger von Bechlarn.

58
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:58,584
King Gunther, Margrave Rdiger
von Bechlarn asks for an audience!

59
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:40,084
I come as ambassador to King Attila.
He who is called the Lord of the Earth -

60
00:04:55,542 --> 00:05:03,084
He who seeks the hand
of your sister Kriemhild in marriage.

61
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:33,834
I am afraid King Attila knows not
whom he woos.

62
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:37,834
In the name of Siegfried, who was
murdered and whose murderer lives!

63
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:05,251
Keep in mind how Siegfried died!

64
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:23,292
Lord Attila sends me, O Queen,
to ask for your hand on his behalf!

65
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,626
You seem to know quite well, Rdiger,

66
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:38,209
that I have been exposed

67
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:40,751
to grievous wrongs

68
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,334
in the house of my clan!

69
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:12,001
Brother! Where is your brother Siegfried?

70
00:10:20,876 --> 00:10:25,917
Deliver unto me the murderer
of my husband, O King!

71
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,959
He has remained loyal to me;

72
00:10:37,084 --> 00:10:39,876
so shall I remain loyal to him.

73
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,751
This, Kriemhild, is my final word!

74
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:16,709
Lady Kriemhild, Margrave Rdiger,

75
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:21,417
wishes to speak with you after evensong!

76
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:56,376
Now, Gerenot, is the time
to keep close watch over Burgundy!

77
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:57,709
Speak to me of Lord Attila, Rdiger!

78
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:23,876
You court a dead woman, Rdiger!

79
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,626
He who murdered my husband

80
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:31,417
flaunts the greensparkling sword

81
00:15:31,501 --> 00:15:35,167
that he stole from the dead man.

82
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:31,292
If ever you were done wrong
at Attila's court, my lady,

83
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:36,376
- Lord Attila would know
how to avenge you!

84
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:59,709
Lord Margrave, swear this unto me
in your and in King Attila's names!

85
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:38,084
Not on the cross, Lord Margrave,
- on the sharp edge of your sword!

86
00:18:10,251 --> 00:18:15,542
My lady! Lord Hagen
has stolen the Treasure!

87
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:41,251
You have my word,
Lord Margrave Rdiger!

88
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:15,917
Hagen Tronje, where is the Treasure?

89
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:25,834
Thus spake loyal Hagen:

90
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:29,042
Somewhere, my lady, where no-one

91
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:32,251
might use the gold to forge arms

92
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:35,417
against the kings of Burgundy!

93
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:50,542
Thus ends the First Canto.

94
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:58,459
The Second Canto:

95
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:02,167
How Kriemhild Fled Her Homeland,

96
00:20:02,251 --> 00:20:05,751
and How She Was Received

97
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:09,376
by Lord Attila.

98
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:07,251
You have drunk Siegfried's blood, O Earth!

99
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:11,751
One day I shall drench you
with Hagen Tronje's blood!

100
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:47,376
I shall return! Rest assured, I shall return!

101
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:18,375
My daughter, shall you not proffer your
hand in farewell to your brother Gunther?

102
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:33,834
No, mother.

103
00:26:56,209 --> 00:27:00,251
You are heading far away, Lady Kriemhild.

104
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:04,376
Don't you want to make peace
with your family first?

105
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,292
No, my priest.

106
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:21,251
Don't you even once
want to hail your people, my lady?

107
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:28,584
No, Rdiger.

108
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:51,751
As Kriemhild approached, springtime
blossomed in the land of the Huns.

109
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:57,042
That sack full of gold is mine!
The queen is coming!

110
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,251
Meet her, brother!

111
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:31,667
Royal jewellery!

112
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:39,334
My lady, King Attila's brother,
Blaodel, gives thee welcome!

113
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:13,376
Choose for yourself

114
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:19,626
a kingdom from my lands, Rdiger,

115
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:25,917
in gratitude for this woman!

116
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,417
Ask King Attila, Margrave Rdiger,

117
00:37:45,542 --> 00:37:48,751
whether he is prepared

118
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:52,084
to make your oath his own!

119
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,959
Upon my oath, O Queen:

120
00:38:58,084 --> 00:39:00,709
any man who insults you

121
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,417
or does you wrong

122
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:06,167
shall die a hundredfold death!

123
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:47,751
Thus ends the Second Canto.

124
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:55,751
The Third Canto:

125
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:58,542
How King Attila Besieged Rome

126
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:01,251
and How Kriemhild
Summoned Her Brothers.

127
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:35,542
Lord Attila swore

128
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:38,167
he wanted to turn Rome's churches

129
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,792
into stables for our horses!

130
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:43,417
Why does Lord Attila

131
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:46,084
no longer uphold his oath?

132
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,709
We traipsed headlong into war!

133
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,126
Why don't we ride further onward?

134
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:06,584
Why is Lord Attila's horse

135
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:09,084
tethered to his tent?

136
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:50,459
A great horseman was King Attila!

137
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:54,709
A mighty mare for him was the world!

138
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:58,917
Lord Attila whipped the world - his mare!

139
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:03,167
What does Lord Attila do now?

140
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:18,251
He sleeps! He sleeps!
Lord Attila, Attila sleeps!

141
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:34,417
This white woman has stolen Attila

142
00:43:34,542 --> 00:43:37,417
from underneath our noses!

143
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,417
With her tresses

144
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:43,417
does she bind up the horseman,

145
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:46,042
The great horseman, Lord Attila!

146
00:43:51,584 --> 00:43:54,501
This white woman has stolen Attila

147
00:43:54,584 --> 00:43:57,459
from underneath our noses!

148
00:43:57,584 --> 00:44:00,417
With her tresses

149
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:03,417
does she bind up the horseman,

150
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:06,376
The great horseman, Lord Attila!

151
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:39,251
My lord -! Kriemhild...

152
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:49,209
My lord -! Kriemhild has borne you a son!

153
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:01,042
O Earth... sacred Earth...

154
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:47,666
One wish, O Queen!
One wish that I might fulfill for you!

155
00:52:58,167 --> 00:53:00,876
If you would honour me

156
00:53:00,959 --> 00:53:03,626
and make me happy, Lord Attila,

157
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,417
then summon my brothers

158
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:09,167
as guests to your court!

159
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:30,501
To Worms, Blaodel,

160
00:53:30,584 --> 00:53:34,126
to request as guests to our court

161
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:37,751
the royal brothers of my wife!

162
00:53:55,751 --> 00:54:00,084
Thus ends the Third Canto.

163
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:08,334
The Fourth Canto:

164
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:17,417
How Kriemhild Received Her Brothers.

165
00:54:36,542 --> 00:54:39,542
For more than one moon's time

166
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:42,667
your brothers stayed as guests of Rdiger

167
00:54:42,751 --> 00:54:45,792
in the house of Bechlarn.

168
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:00,751
The minstrels sing a new song of the love

169
00:55:00,876 --> 00:55:04,042
between your brother Giselher

170
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:07,292
and Rdiger's only child,

171
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:10,584
the beautiful Dietlind!

172
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:58,751
And so I bind in faith -

173
00:55:58,876 --> 00:56:01,376
Bechlarn and Burgundy:

174
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,959
one heart, one life, one death!

175
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:21,667
To honour your brothers,

176
00:56:21,751 --> 00:56:24,584
Lord Attila has sent
the noblest of his knights -

177
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:27,542
Dietrich von Bern - to greet them.

178
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:45,084
Once more, Nibelungen,

179
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:48,376
before Lord Attila comes to greet you:

180
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:51,626
Forget not to whom Attila leads thee!

181
00:56:56,917 --> 00:57:01,209
How could we forget, my lord,

182
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:05,626
that we come to visit our sister Kriemhild?

183
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:39,834
Whoever wants to win my gratitude
shall bear my sorrow in mind!

184
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:55,751
It was the day of the summer solstice,

185
00:57:55,876 --> 00:58:00,417
and the Nibelungen arrived at Attila's court.

186
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:19,584
King Attila, I now exhort you to your oath!

187
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:44,709
Siegfried's murderer is in your hands!
Think upon my sorrow!

188
01:00:56,626 --> 01:01:02,209
Will you never forget
Lord Siegfried, my lady?

189
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:29,167
Hagen Tronje shall fight me for his life!

190
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:50,959
You mustn't fight with the murderer, Attila!
You must have the murderer killed!

191
01:01:56,501 --> 01:02:01,084
Have our guest killed?

192
01:02:20,126 --> 01:02:22,959
You swore to me, Attila!

193
01:02:23,084 --> 01:02:25,917
On the life of your child:

194
01:02:26,001 --> 01:02:28,834
Make good upon your oath!

195
01:02:45,001 --> 01:02:49,292
I hail from a desert land, O Queen.

196
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:53,751
If only one thing is sacred, it is a guest!

197
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:18,126
So long as Hagen Tronje
regards the peace of my house,

198
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:23,084
he shall be left in peace!

199
01:03:55,084 --> 01:04:02,292
She spoke: Whoever wants to win
my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind!

200
01:04:58,584 --> 01:05:02,292
Whoever brings me the head of Tronje,

201
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:06,084
I shall fill his shield with gold!

202
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:50,834
But I beseech you:
do no harm to the sons of my mother!

203
01:08:51,792 --> 01:08:56,084
Play on, bard!

204
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:22,626
Thus ends the Fourth Canto.

205
01:09:26,251 --> 01:09:30,917
The Fifth Canto:

206
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:40,584
How the Huns Celebrated
the Summer Solstice with the Nibelungen.

207
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:36,917
Is it the fashion at Worms upon the Rhine

208
01:10:37,001 --> 01:10:41,417
to sit at table armed from head to foot?

209
01:10:55,917 --> 01:11:03,917
Lord Hagen Tronje knows
why he never lays aside his sword!

210
01:15:44,751 --> 01:15:47,584
Methinks that at such a feast

211
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:50,542
the heir to all Attila's crowns

212
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:53,501
mustn't be absent!

213
01:19:36,626 --> 01:19:40,667
Methinks the boy will not live long.

214
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:44,751
Scarcely shall we as guests
attend any court of his!

215
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:17,667
Treason!

216
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:46,251
The child!

217
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:21,209
The work of your guest, Lord Attila!

218
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:57,209
Now, Nibelungen, you are fair game!

219
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:28,417
I demand safe conduct from this hall

220
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:32,334
for myself and my men!

221
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:08,501
Thus ends the Fifth Canto.

222
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:16,417
The Sixth Canto:

223
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:23,751
The Nibelungen's Distress.

224
01:26:32,417 --> 01:26:38,167
Alert Lady Kriemhild of what it is you see!

225
01:27:11,542 --> 01:27:15,792
Open the gate!

226
01:28:09,376 --> 01:28:14,584
No Hun survives any longer in Attila's hall!

227
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:27,167
Avenge thy dead, Huns!

228
01:29:31,584 --> 01:29:34,959
O Queen, it is impossible!

229
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:19,084
Avenge thy dead, Huns,
and the royal child!

230
01:34:07,417 --> 01:34:10,334
Sister!

231
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:23,417
Sister! Consider your mother!

232
01:34:29,626 --> 01:34:35,792
Hand over Siegfried's murderer -
and you shall be free!

233
01:35:38,084 --> 01:35:42,376
The fight is too uneven!

234
01:35:42,459 --> 01:35:46,709
Not one of the Nibelungen
will gaze upon this next dawn.

235
01:35:54,584 --> 01:35:59,667
In Giselher does my own child die!

236
01:36:07,834 --> 01:36:13,084
Stay out of it, Rdiger!

237
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:26,209
Blood shall follow blood!

238
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:12,084
Get me Rdiger!

239
01:39:22,792 --> 01:39:28,667
The time is nigh, Lord Rdiger!
Make good upon your oath!

240
01:39:42,626 --> 01:39:49,876
Lord Margrave Rdiger,
I demand from you Siegfried's murderer!

241
01:39:59,876 --> 01:40:02,459
You do not send me against Hagen Tronje,

242
01:40:02,584 --> 01:40:05,167
- you send me

243
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:07,917
against your brothers, my lady,

244
01:40:08,001 --> 01:40:10,626
who defend him with their very lives!

245
01:40:24,167 --> 01:40:28,251
You've sworn an oath, Rdiger!

246
01:40:28,334 --> 01:40:32,417
You've sworn it upon the sharp edge
of your sword!

247
01:40:57,417 --> 01:41:02,584
I engaged my only child to Giselher!

248
01:41:18,042 --> 01:41:23,251
Blood shall follow blood, Lord Rdiger!

249
01:42:08,876 --> 01:42:14,834
My lord! Do not force me
to kill my only child!

250
01:42:59,084 --> 01:43:04,251
Thus ends the Sixth Canto.

251
01:43:07,876 --> 01:43:12,334
The Seventh Canto:

252
01:43:12,501 --> 01:43:19,626
The Nibelungen's End.

253
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:44,917
Lord Rdiger stands before the gate!

254
01:43:48,042 --> 01:43:51,667
He will bring us peace!

255
01:44:08,334 --> 01:44:12,209
What do you bring us, father?

256
01:44:18,417 --> 01:44:21,251
Death!

257
01:44:54,209 --> 01:45:00,459
My lord, do not allow they
who love one another to kill one another!

258
01:45:07,042 --> 01:45:09,126
Tell them:

259
01:45:09,251 --> 01:45:11,376
They must deliver unto me

260
01:45:11,459 --> 01:45:13,584
the murderer of my child

261
01:45:13,709 --> 01:45:15,834
- and they are free!

262
01:45:29,626 --> 01:45:34,876
You know not the German soul, Lord Attila!

263
01:45:41,459 --> 01:45:50,376
The oath I made to Kriemhild is older
than the oath between myself and you!

264
01:45:58,876 --> 01:46:05,209
Don't force me to break my oath! Fight!

265
01:46:17,376 --> 01:46:24,917
Do you wish me to lose my honour?! -
Defend yourself, Hagen Tronje!

266
01:47:32,751 --> 01:47:36,751
O sister, what you have wrought!

267
01:48:11,584 --> 01:48:16,709
Deliver Hagen unto me -
and you are free!

268
01:49:23,917 --> 01:49:27,501
Exalt in your revenge, Kriemhild!

269
01:49:27,584 --> 01:49:31,209
Your younger brother is dead!

270
01:49:31,292 --> 01:49:34,917
Rdiger and his men are dead!

271
01:49:47,126 --> 01:49:53,584
But Hagen Tronje lives on,
who slew your Siegfried!

272
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:50,417
Hurl fire into the hall!

273
01:53:23,376 --> 01:53:27,501
My lord! The Queen bids the hall
be bombarded with fire arrows!

274
01:53:27,584 --> 01:53:31,709
The palace is burning!

275
01:53:49,001 --> 01:53:52,251
Lady Kriemhild is right,

276
01:53:52,334 --> 01:53:55,584
she is more than right!

277
01:53:55,667 --> 01:53:58,917
I myself will stand at her side as the fire

278
01:53:59,001 --> 01:54:02,251
flushes the murderer Hagen from his hole!

279
01:54:30,251 --> 01:54:33,417
You have my thanks, Kriemhild!

280
01:54:33,542 --> 01:54:36,751
Although we were never united in love,

281
01:54:36,876 --> 01:54:40,084
we will, in the end, yet be united in hate!

282
01:54:54,334 --> 01:55:01,584
Never, King Attila,
was my heart so filled with love as now!

283
01:56:09,334 --> 01:56:12,917
I don't want King Gunther of Burgundy

284
01:56:13,042 --> 01:56:16,667
to die a smoky death!

285
01:56:16,751 --> 01:56:20,417
I shall offer Lady Kriemhild my head!

286
01:56:25,292 --> 01:56:32,917
Speak, ye Nibelungen, will you
buy your lives with Hagen Tronje's head?!

287
01:56:40,251 --> 01:56:49,001
Loyalty, unbroken by iron,
also will not melt in fire, Hagen Tronje!

288
01:57:16,751 --> 01:57:21,917
Look! Volker prepares his fiddle
for one final song!

289
01:57:45,084 --> 01:57:48,709
I call it a shame and a disgrace,

290
01:57:48,792 --> 01:57:52,376
Lady Kriemhild, that you let these heroes

291
01:57:52,459 --> 01:57:56,042
whom you could not defeat in battle

292
01:57:56,126 --> 01:57:59,709
be annihilated in fiery distress!

293
01:58:19,709 --> 01:58:23,667
Do you hear? Lord Volker is singing!

294
01:59:23,751 --> 01:59:32,626
O, that we were on the cool, green Rhine!

295
02:01:02,501 --> 02:01:06,542
Do you hear? Lord Volker is singing!

296
02:01:10,417 --> 02:01:15,501
You are no human being,
Lady Kriemhild -!

297
02:01:28,542 --> 02:01:33,751
No! I died when Siegfried died...

298
02:01:36,209 --> 02:01:40,334
An end -! An end -!

299
02:01:53,917 --> 02:01:59,042
One vassal still lives, Lord Attila!

300
02:06:57,042 --> 02:07:00,626
I cannot go home to my dead Siegfried

301
02:07:00,751 --> 02:07:04,334
before having atoned for every wrong...

302
02:07:04,417 --> 02:07:08,042
Here is the sword, Lord Hagen.

303
02:07:08,126 --> 02:07:11,751
Where is the Treasure?

304
02:07:19,251 --> 02:07:22,917
I swore never to betray
the location of the Treasure

305
02:07:23,042 --> 02:07:26,751
so long as one of my kings still lives!

306
02:08:02,751 --> 02:08:05,751
Now, Kriemhild,

307
02:08:05,876 --> 02:08:08,876
no-one knows anything of the Treasure

308
02:08:08,959 --> 02:08:11,959
other than God and myself!

309
02:08:12,084 --> 02:08:15,084
And God is no more discreet than I!

310
02:09:08,876 --> 02:09:12,917
Now, Earth, drink your fill!

311
02:09:38,251 --> 02:09:41,876
Deliver her home to Siegfried,

312
02:09:41,959 --> 02:09:45,584
her dead husband!

313
02:09:45,667 --> 02:09:49,292
She belonged to no other man!

314
02:09:57,667 --> 02:10:02,084
Here does the myth have an end.

315
02:10:03,084 --> 02:10:07,334
