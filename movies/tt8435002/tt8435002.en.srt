3
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:51,570
Wait! Don't!

4
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,423
Hey, I told you
to stop doing that!

5
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,050
Oh, yeah, cos I listen to you.

6
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,513
What do we think
of this place?

7
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,431
Yeah, I like this place.

8
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,099
Yeah? You reckon
we could stay here?

9
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,267
Maybe.

10
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,898
Tide's on the move.
We'd better head back.

11
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,529
Good one for the blog.

12
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,952
Oh, my God.
There was something there.

13
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,119
There was something
right there!

14
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,705
- Nothing there.
- Something right there!

15
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,207
I don't see anything.
There's nothing here.

16
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,252
- There was something right there!
- Baby, there's nothing there.

17
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,462
I literally just saw something!

18
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,505
Tracy! Trace!

19
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,049
- Calm down. I believe you, OK?
- OK.

20
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,092
- I believe you.
- OK.

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,510
- Let's just get back, alright?
- OK. OK.

22
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,345
Nice and calm, OK? Come on.

23
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,941
Come on, baby.

24
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,234
Luke, hurry up!

25
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,154
Oh, fuck.

26
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,078
Luke?

27
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,204
Luke?

28
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,207
Luke!

29
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,584
No, no, no!

30
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,170
No!

31
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:33,672
No!

32
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,965
No!

33
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,212
Fuckin' awesome!

34
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,880
Ugh.

35
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,757
If you wanted a rollercoaster

36
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,383
we could've gone
to Dreamworld.

37
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,304
Charlie.

38
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,516
Was just a couple of turns.

39
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,062
- And a chandelle.
- Ah, shit.

40
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,189
You gotta
be kidding me. Why?

41
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,275
You know what,
your mess, you clean it.

42
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,569
Alright?

43
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,071
Well, technically,
it wasn't my mess.

44
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,074
Hey, I thought
you were the nurse.

45
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,577
Triage nurse, Charlie. Triage.

46
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,705
Piss bottles and puke bags
are not on my radar.

47
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,932
He threw up on the microphone.

48
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:51,059
Well, don't put it there!

49
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,645
Bathroom. Come on.

50
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,487
Gonna have to
change the plugs soon.

51
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,322
She's starting
to run a bit rough on idle.

52
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:06,992
OK. And?

53
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,673
I think that's
enough work for today.

54
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,102
Y'know, there's a couple
of beers in there

55
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,353
with our names on 'em.

56
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,744
You know I'm mad at you, right?

57
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:56,917
Doesn't look like it.

58
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,571
So...

59
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,157
the bank called again today.

60
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,200
Mm.

61
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,411
I told them
that you would call them back

62
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,496
when you landed.

63
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,084
Come on.

64
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,211
You want me to charm them
into an extra few weeks' grace?

65
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,671
Yeah, well, I would love that

66
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:45,215
but we can't
keep doing that forever.

67
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:46,675
I can.

68
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,135
We can't.

69
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,596
If we do, they're gonna
cut off our line of credit

70
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,139
and then
we can't run our business.

71
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,643
You can be so damn
practical sometimes.

72
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,648
Fine, you win.

73
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,815
I'll call them.

74
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,900
Thank you.

75
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,829
What?

76
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,293
Nothing.

77
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,553
You ever think maybe
we should get married?

78
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,019
Hold that thought.

79
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,485
Pearl Air Charter Service.

80
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,198
Yeah. Yeah, we do that.

81
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,078
I'll just have
to check my... my bookings

82
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,454
but when were you thinking?

83
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,958
OK, great.
I can... I can make that work.

84
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,004
Have you been on the website?

85
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,507
Great.

86
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,717
Great. OK.

87
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,052
If you could just give me
your email address.

88
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:13,846
Yep.

89
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,389
Perfect. Well, I'll flick you
a note to confirm

90
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,016
and we'll see you tomorrow.

91
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,060
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah!

92
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,271
Hell's Reef. Lunch on the reef.
The whole enchilada!

93
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,398
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, midday.

94
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,526
Hey.

95
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,445
It's OK. This is good.

96
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,756
Hey. They're here.

97
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,808
- That's a nice car.
- Fancy.

98
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,528
Alright, let's go.

99
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,832
"Minase."
I thought he was Italian.

100
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,766
Hi, there.

101
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,434
Kaz Fellows.

102
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,269
Welcome to the Pearl Coast,
Mr Minase.

103
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,896
Joji,
but everyone calls me "Jo."

104
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,898
Thank you.
My wife, Michelle.

105
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,274
- Hi.
- Hi. This is Charlie.

106
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,068
You two spoke
on the phone yesterday.

107
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,111
Ah, yes, of course.
Captain Charlie.

108
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,697
"CC." Like the chips.

109
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,659
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

110
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,704
- You too.
- Uh, so we ready?

111
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,831
We're all set.
Ready when you are.

112
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,373
- Very good.
- Great.

113
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,251
I told you we'd make it
for the 12th.

114
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,505
There's wonderful snorkelling
out there, if you're interested.

115
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,674
Oh, I love it.
Runs in the family.

116
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,009
But we don't get
to the water much.

117
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,803
No. I'll just sit on the beach

118
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,055
and if there's a cold beer
in my hand, I'll be happy.

119
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,431
Now, that I can guarantee.

120
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,936
Alright. Well, come on.
I'll show you round.

121
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,187
Oh, wonderful.

122
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,773
We're just
loading everything up.

123
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,775
- Watch your step right here.
- Oh, thank you.

124
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:34,820
- Oh.
- Oh.

125
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,155
You first.

126
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,117
- Here we go, eh?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,452
Um, how long?

128
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,372
90 minutes cruising.
Arrive in time for a late lunch.

129
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,456
Excellent.

130
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,334
I hope you're not expecting
anything too rough?

131
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,919
I'm not a great flyer.

132
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,714
I make sure all my passengers
have a good flight.

133
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:03,724
Is he coming?

134
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,561
Benny's our cook.

135
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:10,939
As long as that's all he does.

136
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,020
You guys good back there?

137
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,816
Yes, we are.

138
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,578
Keep your eyes open,
you might see a whale.

139
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,995
Or a shark.

140
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,040
- Shark?
- Great white.

141
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,417
You don't wanna go swimming
with one of them, eh, Jo?

142
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:15,170
Benny.

143
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:21,802
Unlikely.

144
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,345
It's the wrong time of year.

145
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,056
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

146
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,265
He's sure.

147
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,185
Charlie here trained
as a marine biologist.

148
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,895
He was a good one.

149
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,188
I thought so too

150
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,357
until the shark
took a bite out of me.

151
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,525
Here we go.

152
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:38,443
- Really? What happened?
- Darling, please.

153
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,070
He may not want
to talk about it, y'know.

154
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,446
Bring back bad memories.

155
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,281
No. No, no, it's fine.
Doesn't worry me.

156
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,159
I was researching
black-tipped reef sharks

157
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,620
and their pack-hunting skills.

158
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,287
They're damn good at it.

159
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,791
One day, I was out on my own,
first mistake

160
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,044
and one grabbed me
from behind, spat me out.

161
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,337
Never saw it coming.

162
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,507
Second mistake,
not paying attention.

163
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,175
Luckily, it was more of
a love bite than a real chomp.

164
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,053
A love bite that put him
in the hospital for two weeks.

165
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,683
Ooh, you'll love this, Joji.

166
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,644
Hey, few years back,
a group of tourists

167
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,270
went on one
of them shark tours...

168
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,149
...when a three-metre shark,
great white

169
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,567
jumped into the back
of the boat...

170
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,528
Scared the hell out of them.

171
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,822
Benny.

172
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,074
It's OK.

173
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,855
Welcome to Hell's Reef.

174
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,607
We made it.

175
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,318
Officially, it's called
"Imperious Reef"

176
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,945
but local divers renamed it

177
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,280
after a pearl lugger
was shipwrecked here on the reef

178
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,782
out there during a storm.

179
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,743
It's actually a crazy story.

180
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:12,621
Eight crew members
were stranded here for 15 days

181
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,122
with no food and no water.

182
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,791
Only one of them survived, an...

183
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,876
An 18-year-old Japanese diver.

184
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:19,670
Saeki Morita.

185
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,130
Yeah.

186
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,844
My grandfather.

187
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,641
12th of October, 1951.

188
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,311
You know the story?

189
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,938
Every pearler knows the story.

190
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,232
Saeki's a bit
of a legend around here.

191
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,119
His dying wish was
to be here with his shipmates.

192
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,171
Shall we take a look around?

193
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,633
- Uh...
- Yeah, yeah.

194
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,010
- Go, go. Here.
- Oh. Thanks.

195
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,724
You gonna tell 'em
it's a national park

196
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:14,933
and they shouldn't
be doing that?

197
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,018
No, I'm not.

198
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,186
Just go help Benny, alright?

199
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,438
Come on, big boy.

200
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:37,205
Stunning.

201
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:40,709
I love it out here.

202
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:42,961
Me too.

203
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,554
Hey, you know how we were, um

204
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,557
talking crazy yesterday

205
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,517
about the idea
of maybe getting married?

206
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,061
I think you should make
an honest man out of me.

207
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,523
Well, I don't know
if that's possible

208
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,316
- but if you were being seri...
- Look!

209
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,910
God, they're beautiful.

210
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,331
Charlie?

211
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,833
Mm?

212
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,295
I'm pregnant.

213
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:32,845
Wow.

214
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,388
Yeah.

215
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,184
Wow!

216
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,813
Are you gonna say
anything else?

217
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,734
Wow! Are you... are you OK?

218
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,236
I'm fine.

219
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,615
Is that it?

220
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,159
So what now?

221
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,162
I think that we, um...

222
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,708
finish this trip and then...

223
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:04,877
get married, yeah?

224
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,255
Are you sure?

225
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,718
About being pregnant
or getting married?

226
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:14,762
No, about me being the father.

227
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,848
You're such a jerk.

228
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,561
I know this...

229
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,438
wasn't planned at all

230
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,776
but are you OK?

231
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:31,654
I am.

232
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,031
I really am.

233
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,285
It's a surprise,
but an awesome one.

234
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,831
I just don't really know
what we're gonna do, y'know?

235
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,084
With the business and money
and us and a baby...

236
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,127
We'll be fine.

237
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,047
More than fine.

238
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,884
We'll crush it.
Like we always do.

239
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,391
Hey!

240
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,019
- Charlie!
- What's he carrying on about?

241
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:05,646
Kaz!

242
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,231
What's up, mate?

243
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,067
Yous two need to come with me.

244
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,577
Hey, Michelle.

245
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:21,995
Are you OK?

246
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,206
No, she's not fucking OK.

247
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,249
Whoa. What is it?

248
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,210
There.

249
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:37,928
Charlie.

250
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,054
<i>Charlie!</i>

251
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,809
Fuck.

252
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:32,608
Ah, shit.

253
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,240
We need to get them
outta here, OK?

254
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,146
A shark attacked him?

255
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:55,858
Yeah.

256
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,194
- Should we tell someone?
- I already did.

257
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:01,363
The coastguard
are gonna handle it.

258
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,741
It's gotta be
out there somewhere.

259
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:06,994
What?

260
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,704
Their boat.

261
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,706
She could still be alive.

262
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,041
And out there,
she won't last very long.

263
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,168
She? How do you know
there's anyone else?

264
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,927
We should leave this
to the authorities.

265
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,346
You've got no idea where to look

266
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,140
and the chance of finding
anything is almost zero.

267
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,433
- Yeah, we have to try.
- I wanna get outta here.

268
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,145
- My charter, my call!
- It's not happening, mate.

269
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,266
We've got
45 minutes fuel reserve

270
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,686
so we're gonna put
our eyes on this place.

271
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:14,895
We'll be at 1,000 feet.

272
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,522
Anyone sees anything,
we'll check it out.

273
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,816
I'm guessing all this shit
went down yesterday

274
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,317
so with the tides and currents

275
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,528
best we can do
is cover the eastern side.

276
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,954
There! Down there!

277
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,544
OK, we're going down.

278
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,105
Gotta take a look.

279
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:43,984
Yeah.

280
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,069
No.

281
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,030
You can't.

282
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,743
If you get hurt down there,
who flies this plane?

283
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:58,206
Benny?

284
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,543
Sure.

285
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,588
If anything goes wrong,
bang on the hull.

286
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,089
Loudly.

287
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,374
Come on, Benny.

288
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,311
Benny!

289
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,998
You OK?

290
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,055
Was she attacked?

291
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:30,734
Shit.

292
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:35,197
Come on, guys.

293
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:37,616
Let's get outta here.

294
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:53,632
You alright?

295
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:56,552
What's next?

296
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,261
Home.

297
00:27:59,722 --> 00:28:00,848
Come on, Benny, move it.

298
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:02,265
Yeah. Sweet as.

299
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:21,910
What the hell was that?

300
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,537
Michelle. Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

301
00:28:23,704 --> 00:28:25,497
- Are you OK?
- Uh...

302
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,877
- Get her out of here!
- C'mon!

303
00:28:30,002 --> 00:28:31,169
Benny! Where's Benny?

304
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:33,756
- Benny!
- I can't get if off!

305
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,258
- Ow!
- Benny, get the life-raft.

306
00:28:36,967 --> 00:28:38,176
OK, OK. Move. We're done.

307
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,970
This thing'll be on the
bottom in a couple minutes.

308
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,471
- The seatbelt, get it.
- I can't...

309
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:52,941
OK. Are you OK?

310
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,484
- Are you sure?
- Now, Jo!

311
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,697
I warned you. I told you.

312
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:00,407
- Get out!
- C'mon, Jo.

313
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,784
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

314
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,243
- Cessna 206 Seaplane...
- Charlie!

315
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,327
We gotta get outta here!

316
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,622
Just grab whatever you can.
Lifejackets, flares, wetsuits

317
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:07,540
water, whatever.

318
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,671
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
Cessna 206 Seaplane, 31417.

319
00:29:13,796 --> 00:29:15,631
15 nautical miles
northeast of Hell's Reef.

320
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,925
Do you read me? Please respond.

321
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,885
Charlie,
we gotta get out now!

322
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,762
Five POBs,
starboard pontoon destroyed.

323
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:22,721
We're sinking fast.

324
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:24,723
If you read me,
please respond! Over!

325
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,655
- Get in the raft, Jo!
- I'm not getting in that!

326
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,533
Suit yourself,
but this plane's

327
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:43,909
gonna be on the bottom
in a minute.

328
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:45,911
I'm not floating around
with that thing out there!

329
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:47,162
Jo, please!

330
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,914
Like I said, your choice.

331
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:54,503
- Put the life jacket on!
- Jo!

332
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:05,055
Jo, come on!

333
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:06,056
Hurry up!

334
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,602
Jo!

335
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:13,856
Come on, Jo!

336
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,567
Yes! Quick!

337
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,693
Come on!

338
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:20,821
Quick! Grab him!

339
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,593
You're gonna need
a couple of stitches

340
00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:26,469
but it's actually
not that deep.

341
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:27,721
Sorry.

342
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,056
Thanks, Kaz.

343
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,607
You get a mayday out?

344
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,611
Maybe, I'm not sure.

345
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:45,072
You're kidding me.

346
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:47,950
He's not sure.

347
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:52,830
That shitbox
have a safety beacon?

348
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,376
It's gone with the plane.

349
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:04,883
We've been attacked.

350
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:07,302
We're floating around
in this piece of plastic junk

351
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,429
and you're not sure if anyone
knows how fucked we are

352
00:32:09,513 --> 00:32:10,931
or even where we are?

353
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,601
What about the rescue boat?

354
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,310
It's on its way, isn't it?

355
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:18,063
Shouldn't we wait for them?
They know we're out here.

356
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,065
We're in the current.

357
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:22,818
By morning,
we'll be 75 Ks from here.

358
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,278
It'll take them days to find us.

359
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,073
And a search plane?

360
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:33,370
It'll be dark soon.

361
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:36,832
They won't send a plane
until first light.

362
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:49,803
We're way off course

363
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:52,556
and I figure 150K from shore...

364
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,057
150 kilometres?

365
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,353
Our best chance
is to use the current.

366
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,898
It's running for us,
and if we paddle with it

367
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,650
we could make land
by tomorrow afternoon.

368
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,027
If we're not picked up
before then.

369
00:33:06,028 --> 00:33:07,738
Could we go back? To the reef?

370
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:09,489
Not an option.

371
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:10,866
Says you.

372
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:13,827
Yeah.

373
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:16,204
And what do you gotta say,
mate?

374
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,373
Because all I've seen so far

375
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,042
is a bunch of
pissing and moaning.

376
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,295
What, you got a better idea?

377
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,183
The current is running
at five knots.

378
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,476
Running east, towards the coast.

379
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:40,896
Hell's Reef is over there,
to the southwest.

380
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:43,023
We can't paddle against it,
we won't get anywhere.

381
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,734
So we use it get to the coast.

382
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,737
They're the facts,
you're the analyst.

383
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,073
you fucking figure it out.

384
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,872
What about...

385
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:01,584
it?

386
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,271
Maybe it'll go away.

387
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,612
Maybe the rising temperatures
messed with its season.

388
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:31,905
Maybe the lack of fish.

389
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,079
So far, so good.

390
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,362
You saw it?

391
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,993
And?

392
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:46,707
About five metres.

393
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,088
I've seen bigger
back home, though.

394
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:08,270
How's the arm?

395
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:14,818
I can paddle.

396
00:37:35,506 --> 00:37:36,882
- You OK?
- Yeah.

397
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,010
You're gonna have
a little bump there

398
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,804
but it's actually not so bad.

399
00:37:43,096 --> 00:37:44,097
Thanks.

400
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:48,143
I'll live.

401
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,488
Jo hates the water.

402
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,534
Always has.

403
00:38:06,411 --> 00:38:08,080
He almost drowned
when he was a kid.

404
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,710
I had to work on him

405
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:14,545
just to get him
to come on this trip.

406
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:21,176
And this happens.

407
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:25,681
Yeah.

408
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,185
How'd you meet Charlie?

409
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,106
Uh, I was, um...

410
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:38,777
I was working at the hospital

411
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,154
when he was brought in
after his attack.

412
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:46,326
It really just amazed me
how calm he was.

413
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,122
Even though
he had almost lost his leg.

414
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,001
That's Charlie for you.

415
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,049
Do you have kids?

416
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,385
No way.

417
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:10,475
I mean, I'm...

418
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,312
I'm just not ready yet.

419
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,651
I get that.

420
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:21,945
Kinda feel the same way.

421
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,203
Are you...

422
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,540
Yeah.

423
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:36,794
When are you due?

424
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:39,963
In about seven months.

425
00:40:45,654 --> 00:40:47,114
How far do you think we've come?

426
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:52,119
Maybe 15 Ks.

427
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,412
That's good.

428
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,250
Yeah. Yeah, we're doing OK.

429
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,128
Speak up, Captain.
What are you saying?

430
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,717
I said we've still got
over 130 Ks to go.

431
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:11,972
What was that?

432
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:16,351
There.

433
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:18,228
- There.
- Shark!

434
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:21,481
Jo!

435
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:23,526
Sit down, ya numbnut!

436
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,236
Fuck off! Leave us alone.

437
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:27,988
It's a dolphin.

438
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,657
Jo! Sit down.

439
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,283
It's a dolphin.

440
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,125
Oh, my God.

441
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:43,962
Fuck, Jo. You scared
the hell out of me!

442
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:49,802
What?

443
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,808
What if you'd fallen overboard?

444
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,397
Yeah.

445
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,819
Yeah. You're right.

446
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:47,920
How many more
of these do we have?

447
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:51,006
That's the last one.

448
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,111
You know sharks, right?

449
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:16,907
I thought I did.

450
00:44:18,576 --> 00:44:21,036
And like you pointed out,
I'm the investment analyst.

451
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,248
You know what that means?
What it is I do?

452
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:28,627
I study situations.

453
00:44:29,211 --> 00:44:31,589
Weigh up the odds, and then,
based on the facts

454
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:32,881
I predict the outcomes.

455
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,469
You say you're
a good marine biologist.

456
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:41,807
Well, I'm a good,
very good analyst.

457
00:44:43,726 --> 00:44:46,311
A clinical assessment
of our situation, as I see it

458
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:50,524
is if the shark
is still out there

459
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:54,361
I'd rate our chances
of all surviving at...

460
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,238
less than 5%.

461
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,782
And that would be
fucking optimistic.

462
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,327
So do you think it's gone?

463
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:07,332
- I really don't know.
- Bullshit!

464
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,627
You said they're
not normally out here

465
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,545
and that thing is
and it's killing people!

466
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,131
It's not gone.

467
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,675
He knows it, and so does she.

468
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,934
- What do you want from me?
- The fucking truth.

469
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:28,771
OK.

470
00:45:32,274 --> 00:45:33,358
It's still out there.

471
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,033
And it's close.

472
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:06,284
Hey.

473
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:07,703
That's enough.

474
00:47:08,954 --> 00:47:10,163
I can go a while longer.

475
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:13,125
Give me your hands.

476
00:47:44,197 --> 00:47:45,115
Thank you.

477
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:48,846
Oh, shit.

478
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:50,430
Michelle?

479
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:53,684
I think I dropped the paddle.

480
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:56,562
What do you mean,
you dropped it?

481
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:58,063
I-I was paddling
and it just seemed

482
00:48:58,146 --> 00:48:59,773
to come out of my hand.
I'm so sorry.

483
00:49:00,273 --> 00:49:01,274
I'm so sorry.

484
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,861
I got it!

485
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:05,195
There!

486
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:10,283
I'm sorry. I'm...

487
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,913
<i>Charlie!</i>

488
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:28,385
Kaz! Kaz!

489
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:30,513
- No, no, no, no!
- I'll be fine. I'm fine.

490
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,559
Come on, Kaz.

491
00:49:53,911 --> 00:49:54,912
Come on, Kaz.

492
00:50:12,805 --> 00:50:14,557
She's almost there,
she's almost there.

493
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,393
Just there...

494
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:19,895
Come on, Kaz, come on.

495
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:42,585
Come on, Kaz.

496
00:50:51,468 --> 00:50:52,511
Son of a bitch.

497
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:55,180
Kaz! Kaz! Come on, Kaz, move it!

498
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:00,435
Come on, Kaz! Move it!

499
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:01,478
Move, Kaz!

500
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:03,564
Quickly!

501
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:07,359
Up, up, up!

502
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,360
Here, put these on.
They'll keep you warm.

503
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,486
Thanks.

504
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:02,600
Here, let me help you
with that...

505
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:04,101
Take your hands off my wife!

506
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:08,063
- Back off.
- What'd you say?

507
00:53:08,606 --> 00:53:09,690
Hey, Benny.

508
00:53:10,691 --> 00:53:13,235
I said take that rod
out of your arse

509
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:14,695
and use it to paddle.

510
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:17,531
Benny!

511
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:19,241
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

512
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:20,659
Benny! Benny!

513
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,453
- Benny...
- Where is he? Benny!

514
00:53:25,205 --> 00:53:26,582
- Benny, come on!
- Come on.

515
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:27,875
Benny, Benny, come on!

516
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,377
- Steady. Nice.
- Ow, my arm!

517
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:31,962
- Come on!
- Hey, look at me.

518
00:53:32,129 --> 00:53:33,922
- Come on, Benny.
- Come on, right here.

519
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:35,758
Right here.
Look at me, Benny. Come on.

520
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,218
- Almost there.
- Got you.

521
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:42,890
Come on!

522
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,349
Come on, almost there.

523
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,018
Gimme your hand.

524
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:47,770
Come on, mate.

525
00:53:49,647 --> 00:53:50,731
Let's get you in.

526
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:55,068
Benny! No!

527
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,612
Benny! No!

528
00:54:09,792 --> 00:54:11,919
- Fucking idiot!
- Don't, don't, don't.

529
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,336
- You fucking...
- Don't, don't!

530
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,547
He's not worth it.

531
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:29,477
Benny.

532
00:55:29,747 --> 00:55:30,789
I had him.

533
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,253
I had his hand.

534
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:47,806
If I could've just held onto him
a little bit longer

535
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:49,474
- I think I could have...
- Stop. Stop.

536
00:55:55,648 --> 00:55:56,815
It wasn't your fault.

537
00:56:54,331 --> 00:56:55,415
Hey, Michelle.

538
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,501
Just one mouthful.

539
00:56:58,586 --> 00:56:59,587
Thanks.

540
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:49,720
If could get close enough...

541
00:57:56,810 --> 00:57:58,604
Its brain's small,
set between the eyes

542
00:57:58,687 --> 00:57:59,772
in the middle of the skull

543
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:01,607
which is pretty much
unprotected.

544
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:03,901
If got this in the right place

545
00:58:05,277 --> 00:58:06,278
it might work.

546
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:10,032
You'd have to be really close.

547
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:14,119
That's the tricky bit.

548
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,790
That's a terrible idea, Charlie.

549
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:22,419
I didn't say it was a good plan.

550
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:44,983
Please.

551
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,710
Jo.

552
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:03,186
Jo.

553
01:00:03,896 --> 01:00:04,897
Here.

554
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,107
Have a rest.

555
01:00:10,193 --> 01:00:11,153
Thank you.

556
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:52,485
Charlie!

557
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,197
Get back to the raft, everyone
get the fuck outta the water!

558
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:11,714
Jo!

559
01:01:14,675 --> 01:01:15,801
Move, Jo. Move!

560
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,053
- Move!
- Hurry up!

561
01:01:18,136 --> 01:01:19,221
Jo, no!

562
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:22,725
- Move, Jo. Move!
- Move it!

563
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:24,184
Jo! Jo!

564
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,519
Jo! Swim!

565
01:01:29,231 --> 01:01:31,149
Just swim! Swim to us now.

566
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,194
Jo!

567
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:39,282
Come on, let's go!

568
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:48,542
Jo! No!

569
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:57,300
No! No!

570
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,013
Easy. Easy.
Easy, Michelle. Easy.

571
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:13,316
He's gone.

572
01:02:24,537 --> 01:02:26,038
Kaz? Hey, Kaz?

573
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:29,291
Kaz, look at me.
Hey, look at me.

574
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:30,543
I'm OK!

575
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:47,685
Jo... Jo! He...

576
01:02:48,226 --> 01:02:50,813
He's alive, he's... he's alive.
He's... come on, Jo!

577
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:51,855
Jo! Quickly!

578
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,942
Jo, Jo! Quickly, quickly...

579
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:57,570
Jo, it's OK.
We're gonna get him.

580
01:02:58,571 --> 01:02:59,613
Please...

581
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:00,656
Jo!

582
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:03,992
Help me.

583
01:03:04,743 --> 01:03:05,744
Please.

584
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,081
Jo! No!

585
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:17,089
No...

586
01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:19,610
Please take care of him, Grandpa.

587
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:03,779
Michelle?

588
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:09,076
Michelle?

589
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,294
Michelle.

590
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:23,924
We can't give up.

591
01:05:26,384 --> 01:05:27,595
We have to keep trying.

592
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:33,183
We can still survive, OK?

593
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:47,948
Like my grandfather did.

594
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:58,375
Yeah.

595
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:01,169
OK.

596
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:20,147
It punctured the raft.

597
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:23,316
We're losing air.

598
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,488
If we do nothing, we die.

599
01:06:32,785 --> 01:06:34,703
But if we keep
this bloody thing moving

600
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:38,582
there's still a chance
that we can make it home.

601
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:59,687
Why don't you both
just rest a while?

602
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:03,481
No, it's OK. We can keep going.

603
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:10,906
Kaz, just rest a while

604
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:12,741
the current's taking us
the right way.

605
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:14,326
I'm fine.

606
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:20,165
Just take a breather,
sweetheart.

607
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,219
We're doing OK.

608
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,059
Oh, shit.

609
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:43,063
- Charlie?
- It's alright, keep still.

610
01:07:45,398 --> 01:07:47,526
If it comes close enough,
I might have half a chance.

611
01:07:49,277 --> 01:07:50,487
It's alright. Keep still.

612
01:07:55,534 --> 01:07:56,535
Where is it?

613
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,538
I...

614
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:03,626
Where is it?

615
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:06,378
I can't see it.

616
01:08:10,883 --> 01:08:11,884
Goddammit!

617
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:13,552
- Charlie, what? What?
- Oh, fuck!

618
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:14,887
They're hunting in packs!

619
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,055
I love you.

620
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:03,726
Where is it?

621
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:07,690
In the middle, in the middle.

622
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:12,444
It's alright,
it's alright, it's alright.

623
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:12,087
The shore.

624
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:15,007
I can see the shore.

625
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:23,265
Oh, my God. We're gonna make it!

626
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:27,936
Charlie!

627
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:30,230
We did it, Charlie.
We did it!

628
01:10:33,275 --> 01:10:34,568
Alright, c'mon, let's go.

629
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:07,726
Oh, fuck.

630
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:14,650
What do we do?
We're sinking.

631
01:11:15,984 --> 01:11:18,070
Charlie, this raft
is not gonna make it to shore.

632
01:11:25,327 --> 01:11:26,369
<i>Charlie!</i>

633
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:40,551
What are you doing? Charlie!

634
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:46,098
You girls are gonna
make a run for it.

635
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:48,391
Whatever happens,
just don't look back.

636
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:50,728
Just get to shore.
Just get yourselves out of here.

637
01:11:50,811 --> 01:11:52,104
Charlie, no. No!

638
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:54,773
Together.

639
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:57,735
We do this together, OK?

640
01:12:00,946 --> 01:12:02,489
I was supposed
to look after you.

641
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:05,618
Together.

642
01:12:06,744 --> 01:12:07,745
Always together.

643
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:15,418
OK.

644
01:12:17,254 --> 01:12:18,338
Right, here.

645
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,718
You get one in its mouth
or in its eye

646
01:12:22,801 --> 01:12:24,052
and I'll go for the brain.

647
01:12:24,595 --> 01:12:26,639
Take one out,
then we'll go for the other, OK?

648
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,146
OK, you swim.
Just get to the land.

649
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:41,403
You ready?

650
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:42,905
Yeah.

651
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,710
Come on, you fucking pricks,
come on!

652
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:02,382
Michelle! Swim!

653
01:13:02,633 --> 01:13:03,801
Now! Swim!

654
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,010
Come on!

655
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,079
Now!

656
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:26,216
Now!

657
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:01,038
Charlie!

658
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,210
No!

659
01:17:35,698 --> 01:17:36,615
Kaz!

660
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:39,201
Oh, my God.
Come here, come here!

661
01:17:41,244 --> 01:17:42,245
Kaz!

662
01:17:58,095 --> 01:17:59,137
Where's Charlie?

663
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:53,859
Michelle!

664
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:55,193
Kaz!

665
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,280
Shit.

666

Michelle!

01:19:01,074 --> 01:19:01,950
When I tell you to

668
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:03,911
swim to the shore
as fast as you can.

669
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,121
You?

670
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,081
I'll be right behind you.

671
01:19:22,345 --> 01:19:23,889
Now! Go now!
