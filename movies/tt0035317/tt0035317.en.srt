1
00:01:59,443 --> 00:02:02,363
Shh, he's here.

2
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,323
You gentlemen look like

3
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,963
educated men
of good taste.

4
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:22,443
I have here some rare
old first editions.

5
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:23,803
He's not bothering us.

6
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,283
I'm interested
in his books.

7
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,283
Okay.

8
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:32,843
Now here are the
complete works

9
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:34,723
of William Shakespeare,

10
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:37,243
an old German writer.

11
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,643
I like that.

12
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:40,003
We move tonight.

13
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,483
Orders from Berlin.

14
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:42,803
Dr. Tobel is to be

15
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:44,363
across the border
before dawn.

16
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:45,963
But we'd had orders not
to break into his house

17
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,483
and he hides there.

18
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:49,003
Hasn't been
outside in weeks.

19
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,003
The Fuhrer wants no
trouble with Switzerland
at this moment.

20
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,483
We must be very careful.

21
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,523
If we can't break in,

22
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,083
he won't come out?

23
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,923
When the Fuhrer needs
something as badly

24
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,443
as he needs the
Tobel bomb sight

25
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:02,043
there is always a way.

26
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:05,363
Dr. Tobel is interested
in my scientific volumes.

27
00:03:05,403 --> 00:03:07,363
He's see my forged papers

28
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:09,803
and he believes I
come from Yudthem.

29
00:03:09,883 --> 00:03:11,483
No gentlemen.

30
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:13,043
The price is much too low.

31
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,723
I could not possibly
sell such a rare book

32
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,043
for such a price.

33
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:18,523
I will induced Dr. Tobel

34
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:20,043
to come and
visit to my shop.

35
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,243
It's the fastest way.

36
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:24,123
You're interested
in this book,

37
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:29,163
a rare old set of
Bismarck papers.

38
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,843
One last warning.

39
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,923
I've just had
word from Berlin.

40
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:34,443
The English spy hunter

41
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:35,923
will try to
take Dr. Tobel

42
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,483
from under our very eyes.

43
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:38,963
They are sending a

44
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:40,523
stupid bumbling
amateur detective.

45
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:42,043
His name is
Holmes, or Homes

46
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,723
or some such
foolishness.

47
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,323
He'll never escape
from Switzerland alive.

48
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:46,123
Now quick.

49
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:48,163
Get me thrown
out of here

50
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:50,923
and watch for my signal
from Dr. Tobel's window.

51
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:52,963
But gentlemen
you promised

52
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,283
to buy one of books.

53
00:03:54,363 --> 00:03:55,603
I told you no.

54
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:56,883
Ah, stop bothering us.

55
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:59,923
They are not so
great prices.

56
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:03,443
[Arguing in French]

57
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:20,723
French, English, how
I hate those languages.

58
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,323
Calm yourself
my dear brother.

59
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:25,723
In a short time there
will be only one language.

60
00:04:46,403 --> 00:04:48,363
Good evening, Dr. Tobel.

61
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:50,563
I have here some
very interesting

62
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,123
scientific books.

63
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:54,523
I thought you might
like to see them.

64
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:56,043
Please come in.

65
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,883
He's entering the house.

66
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,443
Quickly, get the car and
have the motor running.

67
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:02,923
I will follow.

68
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,763
We'll have the Tobel
bomb sight to the Fuhrer

69
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:08,003
while this Holmes is
still having his tea.

70
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,163
What are you doing?

71
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:35,843
I am sorry but for months

72
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:38,843
every move I have
made has been watched.

73
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,483
I am not a coward,
Mr. Holmes.

74
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,883
They won't watch
you anymore.

75
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:43,203
Tonight they
intend to take you

76
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:44,523
forcibly across
the German border.

77
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:46,083
Then why do we wait
here doing nothing

78
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,683
like rats in a trap.

79
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,723
Calm yourself my
dear Dr. Tobel.

80
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:51,643
We should not only
escape their trap

81
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:54,603
but we should also take
the cheese away with us.

82
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:56,963
But, but how?

83
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,083
The four sections
of your bomb sight

84
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,523
fit inside these
ponderous tombs,

85
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:03,203
although I must confess

86
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,043
that I shy
to the thought
of disembowelling

87
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,803
a complete set of
Charles Dickens.

88
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,803
Ah, but you cannot hide
me in a hollow book.

89
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,323
My dear fellow.

90
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,923
I'm sorry that
my good friend

91
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:13,683
Dr. Watson isn't here
to explain to you

92
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:16,563
that are my preparations
are never slipshot.

93
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,603
Stephan, Eric.

94
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:23,403
Why do you call
my servants?

95
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,763
Your servants, yes,

96
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,323
but tonight they
assume new roles.

97
00:06:26,403 --> 00:06:28,003
Let me present Dr. Tobel

98
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,843
and our old friend,
the bookseller.

99
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:31,403
Holmes, it is so simple.

100
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,043
Yes, the obvious
always appears simple.

101
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,163
Quick now.

102
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,243
We must leave.

103
00:06:35,283 --> 00:06:36,883
Stephan, the knapsack.

104
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:21,963
Stephan, and Eric are
proving excellent decoys.

105
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:23,643
And the Gestapo
has been fooled?

106
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:26,563
Completely.

107
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:28,803
The servants are leading
them into the next street.

108
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:31,203
But what will happen
to Stephan and Eric?

109
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,603
Nothing, don't worry.

110
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:35,483
I've taken care of that.

111
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,483
Away from here.

112
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:38,283
Come on quick.

113
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:49,123
Do you want to take
the Nazis own car?

114
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,203
One must adept oneself
to the tools at hand.

115
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:04,123
You think you've
made them believe

116
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:05,643
you're a harmless
old bookseller.

117
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,243
Yes, I've always felt

118
00:08:07,283 --> 00:08:08,603
that a thorough
knowledge of the classics

119
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:09,963
might come in handy.

120
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:15,243
But how can we get
across the border

121
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,603
and through France?

122
00:08:16,683 --> 00:08:18,443
There's no need
to get across.

123
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:20,083
This very moment a
Royal Air Force plane

124
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:22,683
is waiting for us at the
secret landing place.

125
00:08:36,723 --> 00:08:38,523
How long before we
arrive in London?

126
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:39,883
In a very few minutes.

127
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:41,643
We're passing
over Dover now.

128
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:42,803
Thank you.

129
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:06,683
You'll have to get used

130
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:09,043
to our London
blackouts Dr. Tobel.

131
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,003
Ah.

132
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:36,003
Huh?

133
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,923
Dr. Watson is a
very untidy fellow.

134
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,483
And what, what are we

135
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:41,963
going to do
with, with these?

136
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,443
A problem of the most
elementary nature,

137
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,003
my dear Dr. Tobel.

138
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:53,163
You arent going
to keep them here.

139
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:54,563
And I have
always believed

140
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,563
in the theory
originally projected

141
00:09:56,643 --> 00:09:58,003
by Edgar Allen Poe,

142
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,563
the American writer,

143
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:01,203
that the best place
to hide anything

144
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:03,403
is where everyone
can see it.

145
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:04,923
Yes, but...

146
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:06,643
You will remember
no doubt

147
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:10,443
in Poes story "The
Purloined Letter".

148
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:12,883
And the missing
in question

149
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,643
was always in plain view.

150
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,163
Hands up, gentlemen.

151
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:34,883
Scotland Yard, quick.

152
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:36,923
Oh, my goodness.

153
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,563
Good evening, Mrs. Hudson.

154
00:10:39,603 --> 00:10:42,323
Oh, why it's Mr. Holmes.

155
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:43,643
Holmes!

156
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:44,843
Hello Watson old fellow,

157
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,243
it's good to
see you again.

158
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:47,883
Telephone.

159
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:48,963
Huh?

160
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:50,203
Who do you want?

161
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,203
Oh yes, you're
Scotland Yard.

162
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,083
I'm afraid there's
been a little mistake.

163
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,723
No need to get angry.

164
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:57,323
We all make
mistakes at times.

165
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,923
What?

166
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:01,643
Well if we didn't
you'd be out of a job.

167
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,563
Dr. Tobel, this is my
friend and associate

168
00:11:03,603 --> 00:11:04,963
and as you may observed

169
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,443
my watchdog, Dr. Watson.

170
00:11:06,523 --> 00:11:07,563
How do you do, sir?

171
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:08,643
How do you do?

172
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:10,123
Dr. Tobel and I flew in
from Zurich this evening.

173
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,803
You can put that thing
away now, Watson.

174
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:15,243
Dr. Tobel awarded

175
00:11:15,323 --> 00:11:17,603
the maximum request
for physics in 1939.

176
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:18,803
My dear Watson,

177
00:11:18,883 --> 00:11:20,363
there is only
one Dr. Tobel.

178
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:21,643
Without Mr. Holmes

179
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,883
there would have been no
Dr. Tobel I am afraid.

180
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:25,563
But I thought you were
living in America sir.

181
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,163
I have been working
in Switzerland

182
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,603
for the past two years.

183
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:29,963
And Holmes got you out?

184
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,363
In the nick of time.

185
00:11:31,443 --> 00:11:32,803
There was not a
point he overlooked.

186
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:36,083
Every contingency was
foreseen and provided for.

187
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,883
It was magnificent.

188
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,243
Thank you, doctor.

189
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,523
The problem
was not without

190
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:41,843
its interesting points.

191
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:43,283
Is there anything you
would like, Mr. Holmes?

192
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:44,523
No thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

193
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,843
You can go to bed now.

194
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:47,203
He gave me an
awful fright

195
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,883
dressed up like that.

196
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,043
Well good night, sir.

197
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:51,403
She's quite right.

198
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:52,683
You can't blame me

199
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:53,963
for jumping to the
conclusions I did.

200
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:55,563
You looked like a
broken down musician.

201
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,763
Holmes, why didn't you
take your fiddle with you?

202
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,923
I never did think much of
this dressing up business.

203
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,603
It was necessary,
I assure you.

204
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,203
The Gestapo was
close on our heels.

205
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:05,683
Really?

206
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,283
This is Sherlock Holmes.

207
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:09,003
I want to speak to Sir
Reginald Bailey please.

208
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,283
Reginald Bailey?

209
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,683
Is that the fellow

210
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:12,963
who played rugby
for Black Heath?

211
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:13,803
Yes, Watson.

212
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:14,963
Oh.

213
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,043
Hello, Sir Reginald?

214
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,203
Holmes speaking.

215
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,363
Yes, from Bakers Street.

216
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:21,163
I have Dr. Tobel with me.

217
00:12:21,203 --> 00:12:23,363
Well thank you.

218
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,363
Very well then, I'll
meet you in half an hour.

219
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:27,723
And there must
be no delay.

220
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,163
I'll arrange
with Sir Reginald

221
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:30,683
to have the test
tomorrow morning.

222
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,123
I suggest that only
cabinet ministers

223
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:33,563
and your best aviation
experts be present.

224
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:34,963
Naturally.

225
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:36,243
Watson, I leave
Dr. Tobel in your care.

226
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,483
Give him a sedative.

227
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:38,883
This has been
strenuous business

228
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,363
and he has a long
day ahead of him
again tomorrow.

229
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,963
Certainly Holmes,
of course.

230
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,443
He shall sleep
in my bedroom.

231
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:44,803
I'll keep watch
till you return.

232
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:45,923
Thank you.

233
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:47,243
It is not necessary
to guard me.

234
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:48,683
I am quite safe now.

235
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,243
Safe Dr. Tobel?

236
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,563
I shouldn't count
on it for a second.

237
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:53,043
But Mr. Holmes...

238
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,323
A great deal may
depend on your safety

239
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:55,723
and the enemy
understands that

240
00:12:55,763 --> 00:12:57,203
just as well as we do.

241
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,723
Good night.

242
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,723
Keep alert, Watson.

243
00:13:03,803 --> 00:13:05,203
Yes, sir, of course.

244
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:06,563
A couple of these

245
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:08,003
and you'll
sleep peacefully
through a blitz.

246
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,443
Thank you.

247
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,043
You better start
undressing at once

248
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,843
or you'll find
yourself fast asleep

249
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:14,563
in the middle of
taking off your trousers.

250
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,483
Well I'll sit over here
and keep an eye on things.

251
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:20,083
Oh by the way, if
you're nervous call out.

252
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,403
Good night, doctor.

253
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,403
Good night, doctor.

254
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:25,283
Well funny I was
saying the same thing

255
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:26,563
at the same time.

256
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:27,963
Good night, doctor.

257
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:28,723
Good night, doctor.

258
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:38,523
Untidy fellow, Holmes.

259
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,483
Hello?

260
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,803
Yes, I just arrived
about an hour ago.

261
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:19,923
It is most important
that I see you at once.

262
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,283
No, no.

263
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,763
I cannot explain.

264
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:27,403
It is now five
minutes past midnight.

265
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,363
I leave at once.

266
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:31,043
Goodbye.

267
00:14:45,003 --> 00:14:46,483
Holmes, I don't
have to tell you

268
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,043
how much this
means to us.

269
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:50,003
We'll know a great deal
more about the bomb sight

270
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:52,123
after the demonstration,
Sir Reginald.

271
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:54,683
You always have a pretty
good idea of the value

272
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,163
of the Tobel bomb sight,

273
00:14:56,243 --> 00:14:58,323
just as the Nazis have.

274
00:14:58,403 --> 00:14:59,683
However.

275
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:03,203
Oh, if you care to place
Dr. Tobel under the

276
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:05,323
protection of Scotland
Yard until tomorrow.

277
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,603
No, no, no.

278
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:08,043
No, that won't
be necessary.

279
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,603
I shall personally
deliver Dr. Tobel

280
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:11,123
to your representatives
on Salisbury Plain

281
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,723
in plenty of time for
the demonstration.

282
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:13,643
Thank you.

283
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:14,843
Good night, Sir Reginald.

284
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:16,483
Good night, Mr. Holmes.

285
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:55,843
Charlotte Eberli, Flat B.

286
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,003
Right.

287
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,483
Get the car, ready.

288
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,123
I'll wait here
until he comes out.

289
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,883
Is that what the
Americans call doodling?

290
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,363
It is more serious

291
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:28,043
than you could possibly
realize, Charlotte.

292
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:32,763
Good.

293
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:38,123
More coffee?

294
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,003
No, thank you, darling.

295
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,283
I must get back
before they miss me.

296
00:16:42,323 --> 00:16:44,163
We've been separated
for so long.

297
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:45,523
I couldn't bear

298
00:16:45,603 --> 00:16:47,243
that anything should
part us again.

299
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:48,723
I want to work with you

300
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:51,323
and I want to know every
minute where you are.

301
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:52,683
Even for you

302
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:54,443
to know the details of
my mission in London

303
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,883
is to sign your
death warrant.

304
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:59,883
If you are in real danger
I want to share it.

305
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:02,483
There is one
thing you can do.

306
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:07,123
Guard this envelope.

307
00:17:07,203 --> 00:17:08,563
If anything happens to me

308
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,043
see that it
reaches the hands

309
00:17:10,123 --> 00:17:11,723
of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

310
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,203
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

311
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,603
Yes.

312
00:17:14,643 --> 00:17:17,003
I pray I never
have to deliver it.

313
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,803
Help!

314
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,003
He got away.

315
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,243
Are you all right, sir?

316
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:58,923
I, I think so.

317
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:00,323
It must have
been a robber.

318
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:01,643
Yeah, since the blackouts

319
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:03,123
those have become
quite a nuisance, sir.

320
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:04,323
Uhhh.

321
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:05,643
I say you better
come with me

322
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:06,923
and have that fixed up.

323
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,043
Uhh, thank you.

324
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:09,283
Just lean on my arm.

325
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:29,123
Watson.

326
00:18:29,203 --> 00:18:29,883
Watson, wake up.

327
00:18:29,963 --> 00:18:30,883
Huh?

328
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:31,883
Where's Tobel.

329
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:32,963
He, he, he's there.

330
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:33,883
No he isn't.

331
00:18:33,963 --> 00:18:34,603
He's gone.

332
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:35,763
That's impossible.

333
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:36,643
He's asleep in my bed.

334
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:37,683
I've been here
the whole time.

335
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:40,083
If anything's
happened to him.

336
00:18:40,163 --> 00:18:42,763
Tobel, you all right?

337
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:43,843
Ahh, it is nothing.

338
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:44,843
Yes.

339
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:45,843
Sit down here.

340
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:47,563
Let's have a look.

341
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,043
Well it doesn't
look too bad.

342
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:54,243
Who patched you up,
the police doctor?

343
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,523
Yes.

344
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,643
It looks as if
you've been attacked.

345
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:58,043
Obviously, my dear Watson.

346
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,523
Dr. Tobel,

347
00:18:59,603 --> 00:19:00,723
do you suspect
the woman

348
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,003
of arranging the trap?

349
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,243
Woman, What woman?

350
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:04,723
She's blonde.
Five foot six,

351
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:05,883
full lipped and
very affectionate.

352
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:07,083
Oh really?

353
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,443
You've known her
for a long time.

354
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:09,803
You were attacked after
leaving her apartment.

355
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,203
Holmes, how do
you know this?

356
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,603
The face powder
around your coat

357
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,443
tells me of her height
and her affection for you.

358
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:17,003
You held her close
before departing.

359
00:19:17,043 --> 00:19:18,123
Huh.

360
00:19:18,163 --> 00:19:19,403
It's all there

361
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:20,563
for the trained eye
to read, Watson?

362
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:21,683
But look here.

363
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:22,803
Why couldn't he
have been attacked

364
00:19:22,883 --> 00:19:24,283
on his way to the
woman's apartment?

365
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,883
The mark of the blow has
erased some of the powder.

366
00:19:25,963 --> 00:19:27,243
Obviously if the
attack came first

367
00:19:27,323 --> 00:19:29,003
the powder would have
remained undisturbed.

368
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,603
And the full lips
that was a guess.

369
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:33,683
I never guess, Watson.

370
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:35,603
You have rubbed the
lipstick from your face

371
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:38,403
with a handkerchief you
now hold in your hand

372
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:39,803
and that amount
of lipstick

373
00:19:39,883 --> 00:19:41,283
never came from a
pair of thin lips.

374
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:43,883
And the blonde hair?

375
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,283
Good gracious me.

376
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:49,203
Mr. Holmes, I am glad
you are on my side.

377
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,923
Well in that case
you will desist

378
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,763
from disobeying my
orders and slipping out

379
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,523
while your bodyguard
sleeps his watch away.

380
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,243
It won't happen
again, Holmes.

381
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,403
I was sitting in
front of the fire

382
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:00,363
and must have dozed.

383
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:01,523
All right, All right.

384
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:02,763
Oh, sorry.

385
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:04,803
Now, can you describe
your assailant?

386
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:06,403
I never saw him.

387
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,963
A great figure came
at me in the dark.

388
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,243
I felt a stunning
blow on my head and,

389
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,363
and instantly fingers
were at my throat.

390
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:14,643
But you must have noticed
something about him.

391
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:16,283
Think man.

392
00:20:16,363 --> 00:20:17,643
A thing of little
consequence to you

393
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:18,843
may mean a great
deal to me.

394
00:20:18,923 --> 00:20:19,763
Wait.

395
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,683
Wait a moment.

396
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:22,803
There was one thing.

397
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:26,443
Long fingers at my
throat like, like steel.

398
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:27,723
And then,

399
00:20:27,803 --> 00:20:29,203
then a,

400
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:30,283
an odor,

401
00:20:30,323 --> 00:20:31,403
a heavy drug-like odor.

402
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:32,363
A drug?

403
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:33,483
Opium?

404
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,603
That is it.

405
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:36,603
I am sure of it now.

406
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:38,003
Well, I suggest
we get the remains

407
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,323
of a good night sleep.

408
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,283
Remember, the test takes
place tomorrow morning

409
00:20:41,363 --> 00:20:42,683
on Salisbury Plain.

410
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,403
The principal of
Dr. Tobel's device

411
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,643
involves the use of
three sonic beams.

412
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:54,923
Is that right, sir?

413
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,123
That appears to be it.

414
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,163
There he is.

415
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:17,883
We're on the
course now, sir.

416
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:46,283
Well gentlemen,

417
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:48,683
that load would sink
any ship in the world.

418
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,323
We must consider
the possibility

419
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,683
of good piloting
and a lucky hit.

420
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:54,323
I'd like to see
another try of it.

421
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:56,403
So would I.

422
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,003
They want you to
try again, sir.

423
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:05,123
He's coming into
position now, sir.

424
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:11,483
We're on the
course now, sir.

425
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:36,523
Well gentlemen, how do you
like the bomb sight now?

426
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:37,643
It's marvelous.

427
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,203
We'll revolutionize
the aerial bombardment.

428
00:22:40,283 --> 00:22:41,483
Inspector Lestrade.

429
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:44,283
Yes, Sir Reginald?

430
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,723
I hope Scotland Yard is
taking every precaution

431
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,923
to guard Dr. Tobel
and his equipment.

432
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:50,203
Two plain-clothes men

433
00:22:50,283 --> 00:22:51,563
ride with him
in his car sir,

434
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,843
and four others follow
in another one, sir.

435
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:55,043
Good.

436
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,203
He's coming to my
office in Whitehall

437
00:22:56,283 --> 00:22:57,163
as soon as he lands.

438
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,123
Well shall we
start, gentlemen?

439
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:18,323
Well, here he
is gentlemen.

440
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,523
Congratulations sir.

441
00:23:20,603 --> 00:23:22,003
It was excellent

442
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,883
amazing performance.

443
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:25,163
It was magnificent,
Dr. Tobel.

444
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:27,523
Magnificent.

445
00:23:27,603 --> 00:23:28,843
I am glad we had such

446
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:30,163
ideal conditions
for the test.

447
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,283
I wouldn't have
believed it

448
00:23:31,363 --> 00:23:32,683
if I hadn't
seen it myself.

449
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:33,803
We've been through
a lot, Holmes

450
00:23:33,883 --> 00:23:35,403
but thank goodness
he's safe now.

451
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:38,443
You brought your
apparatus with you?

452
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,923
No, Sir Reginald.

453
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,563
I did not.

454
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,163
But why not?

455
00:23:43,243 --> 00:23:44,723
It must be lodged

456
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:46,123
in the most impregnable
vault in this building

457
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:47,603
until we're ready to
start manufacture.

458
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,123
I have arranged for a
little office of my own.

459
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:52,683
I intend to supervise
the manufacture myself.

460
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,163
But you,

461
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:57,643
you offered it to our
government for our use.

462
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:58,883
Everything
Mr. Holmes has done

463
00:23:58,963 --> 00:24:00,203
has been with that
ideal in view.

464
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:01,963
I still offer it
to your government

465
00:24:02,043 --> 00:24:05,523
but no one else will know
the secrets involved.

466
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:08,643
I have devised the plan
to guard my invention,

467
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:11,923
a plan as intricate as
the bomb sight itself.

468
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:13,243
If you imagined
for one moment...

469
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:14,643
Please.

470
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,883
I will not change my
mind, Sir Reginald.

471
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:20,323
I am taking the matter
into my own hands.

472
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:27,363
Just what do you propose
to do, Dr. Tobel.

473
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:28,803
I am sorry.

474
00:24:28,883 --> 00:24:30,283
I cannot reveal
the details

475
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:31,603
of my plan for
the present.

476
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:33,163
Do you think that's wise?

477
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:34,523
I regret gentlemen.

478
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,403
I cannot change
my decision.

479
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:39,723
I shall work
independently.

480
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:42,523
Can't you persuade
him, Holmes?

481
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:43,723
But supposing something

482
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:45,003
should happen to
you, Dr. Tobel.

483
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,283
You know, there's
already been

484
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:47,563
one attempt
on your life.

485
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,043
And if Holmes'
suspicions are right?

486
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,603
Quiet, Watson.

487
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:53,043
There is no use
discussing it, gentlemen.

488
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,483
My mind is made up.

489
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:56,403
Scotland Yard
will redouble

490
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:57,683
the guard about
you doctor.

491
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,403
In fact we'll
quadruple it.

492
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:02,003
That is just what I do
not wish done, inspector.

493
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,483
That would only
draw attention

494
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:05,123
to my activities.

495
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:06,683
Good day gentlemen.

496
00:25:13,203 --> 00:25:15,323
Just the same I'll have
my men watching him

497
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:16,563
every moment from now on.

498
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:18,763
No, no, Wait Lestrade.

499
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:20,043
We must not
offend Dr. Tobel.

500
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:21,163
We must remember that he,

501
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:22,243
as a citizen
of Switzerland,

502
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:23,283
is under no obligation

503
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:24,843
to give us his invention.

504
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,603
We must do as he asks.

505
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:27,723
Now don't you
agree, Holmes?

506
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:29,083
But sure, Sir Reginald.

507
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,443
I'm not officially
connected with
the government

508
00:25:30,483 --> 00:25:31,563
and I intend to
remain on the case.

509
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:32,843
Good, good.

510
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:34,523
That is if Inspector
Lestrade doesn't mind.

511
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,003
Not at all, Mr. Holmes.

512
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,683
We're always glad to
have you hanging around.

513
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:41,003
Thank you.

514
00:25:41,043 --> 00:25:43,963
You can put those
away now, Lestrade.

515
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:52,843
Hoffner, I am
entrusting this to you

516
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:55,363
because first of all you
are a Swiss and second

517
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:57,323
there is no doubt in my
mind of your ability.

518
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:58,843
I am honored Dr. Tobel.

519
00:25:58,923 --> 00:26:01,163
I have divided the
mechanism of my invention

520
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:02,643
into four units.

521
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,163
Each is meaningless
without the others.

522
00:26:04,243 --> 00:26:05,443
You have delivered
the other three.

523
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:06,723
Yes.

524
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:08,043
No one but myself
knows the identity

525
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,523
of the four scientists

526
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:10,923
working on the four units.

527
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,483
Their names are not even
known to each other.

528
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:14,243
I think I understand.

529
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,523
From what you tell me

530
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:18,643
it will be easy to
reproduce the unit
assigned to me

531
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:20,203
at any quantity you wish.

532
00:26:20,283 --> 00:26:21,763
I knew I could
rely on you.

533
00:26:21,843 --> 00:26:23,283
I will get in
touch with you

534
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:24,523
as soon as I have made

535
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:25,923
the rest of my
arrangements.

536
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,123
No, no, no.

537
00:26:27,203 --> 00:26:29,323
The back door if you
please, Professor Hoffner.

538
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,243
Au vaus.

539
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,283
Au vaus.

540
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:38,763
Hello.

541
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:41,923
Yes, Lestrade.

542
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:44,443
Oh.

543
00:26:44,523 --> 00:26:46,523
Very well.

544
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:47,723
What is it, Holmes?

545
00:26:47,803 --> 00:26:49,003
Just as I feared.

546
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,763
Lestrade's men report
that Tobel is missing.

547
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,003
Missing?

548
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,043
Yes, I was afraid of this.

549
00:27:09,123 --> 00:27:10,843
How long has he
been missing?

550
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,083
Practically since he

551
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,883
walked out of your
office yesterday.

552
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:15,403
If he'd only given the
address of this place

553
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,683
I shouldn't
have had to

554
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:19,323
waste so much
time finding it.

555
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:20,523
Empty.

556
00:27:20,563 --> 00:27:21,843
The bomb sight's gone.

557
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:23,243
I didn't expect to find
here, Sir Reginald.

558
00:27:23,283 --> 00:27:24,523
This is a pretty mess.

559
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:25,723
If you knew this
was going to happen

560
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:27,203
why the devil didn't you
do something about it?

561
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:28,723
You can rely on Holmes
implicitly, Sir Reginald.

562
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:31,003
Tobel is gone and heaven
alone knows where.

563
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,643
It serves me right
for listening to that

564
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:34,163
half-brained idea of his,

565
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:36,083
Dismissing Lestrade's
men and they went

566
00:27:36,123 --> 00:27:38,363
leaving him here
alone and unguarded.

567
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:40,083
Holmes, if anything
has happened to Tobel,

568
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,403
if his invention

569
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:43,123
falls into the
hands of Germany,

570
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,803
it will be a major
disaster for England.

571
00:27:44,883 --> 00:27:46,123
Christmas wrapping.

572
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,483
He did his
Christmas shopping

573
00:27:47,563 --> 00:27:48,803
in plenty of time.

574
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:51,243
Yes, curious.

575
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,603
Do you, do you note
something, Holmes?

576
00:27:53,683 --> 00:27:54,923
Scent.

577
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,043
Perfume.

578
00:27:56,123 --> 00:27:57,243
Yes.

579
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:58,923
I noticed it the moment
we entered the room.

580
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:00,363
Claire de Luna.

581
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:02,443
One of the rarer essences
and very expensive.

582
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,523
That woman again.

583
00:28:03,603 --> 00:28:05,523
Undoubtedly.

584
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:13,323
Get me Inspector Lestrade.

585
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:14,923
Sherlock Holmes calling.

586
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:17,003
So Holmes is
finally stumped.

587
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,563
First time I've heard
him call for help.

588
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,283
Call for help indeed.

589
00:28:20,363 --> 00:28:22,403
He's only just beginning
his investigation.

590
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,443
Lestrade?

591
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:24,643
This is Holmes.

592
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:26,043
Check the records
and place a call

593
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,123
made on my
private telephone
of Bakers Street

594
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:29,643
approximately
twelve o'clock

595
00:28:29,723 --> 00:28:31,563
on the night
of Dr. Tobel's
arrival in London.

596
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:33,643
Finally stumped,
hey Sir Reginald.

597
00:28:33,683 --> 00:28:34,763
Yes, Lestrade?

598
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:38,283
Wait a minute.

599
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:40,963
Charlotte Eberli,

600
00:28:41,043 --> 00:28:42,643
34

601
00:28:42,723 --> 00:28:44,403
St. George's Street,

602
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:46,123
Flat B.

603
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:47,603
Excellent, Lestrade.

604
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,003
Thank you.

605
00:28:50,043 --> 00:28:52,883
Where is Dr. Tobel?

606
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:54,243
I can't tell you.

607
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:55,403
You mean you
won't tell me?

608
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,763
I don't know.

609
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:57,963
How many
Christmas packages

610
00:28:58,043 --> 00:28:59,643
did you take to
him, Ms. Eberli?

611
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:01,123
Five.

612
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:03,163
He dismantled
his bomb sight

613
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:06,443
and packed the units
in four of the boxes.

614
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,883
Is that correct?

615
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:10,603
Pardon me.

616
00:29:13,603 --> 00:29:14,843
Hello.

617
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,363
Yes.

618
00:29:16,443 --> 00:29:19,563
This is Miss Eberli.

619
00:29:19,643 --> 00:29:23,883
Why, why someone
must have stolen it.

620
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:26,003
On Richmond Bypass?

621
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,083
Yes.

622
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:29,003
Yes, I'll arrange
to have it removed.

623
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:30,083
Yes.

624
00:29:30,163 --> 00:29:31,843
At once.

625
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,603
Now I can be frank
with you, Mr. Holmes.

626
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,563
Dr. Tobel has
disappeared.

627
00:29:40,603 --> 00:29:43,723
They found my car on
Richmond Bypass wrecked.

628
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:45,603
I loaned it to
him last night.

629
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,243
For what purpose,
Miss Eberli?

630
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,883
He wouldn't tell me,

631
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:50,243
but he said that

632
00:29:50,323 --> 00:29:51,723
if anything should
happen to him

633
00:29:51,803 --> 00:29:53,443
I was to give you this.

634
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:54,763
Holmes?

635
00:29:54,803 --> 00:29:56,683
Then he must have
expected something.

636
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:58,163
Yes.

637
00:29:58,203 --> 00:29:59,923
This envelope has been
opened and resealed.

638
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:01,323
But that is in impossible.

639
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,523
It hasn't been
out of my hands.

640
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:12,363
What?

641
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:13,963
Why that's not
the message.

642
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,603
It isn't even
the same paper.

643
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:18,403
I saw Dr. Tobel draw
little sets of figures.

644
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,843
What kind of figures?

645
00:30:19,923 --> 00:30:22,523
Well they, they looked
like little dancing men.

646
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,483
Dancing men?

647
00:30:24,563 --> 00:30:25,723
That's curious.

648
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:28,123
Who's been in this
apartment since Dr. Tobel

649
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:30,323
entrusted that
envelope to your care?

650
00:30:30,403 --> 00:30:31,723
Why no one.

651
00:30:31,803 --> 00:30:32,963
I've had no visitors.

652
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:34,123
Think.

653
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:35,243
Possibly a tradesman.

654
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:36,443
No.

655
00:30:36,523 --> 00:30:38,763
Only the one for
a few minutes.

656
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:40,043
And that one?

657
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:41,123
A workman.

658
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:43,123
He came to fix
my light switch.

659
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,483
He couldn't
have possibly...

660
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:45,923
Did you send for him?

661
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:47,243
Why no.

662
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:48,803
My lights went out
and soon afterwards

663
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,243
he knocked at my
door and told me

664
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:51,563
the porter had
sent him up.

665
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:53,723
That's where he worked.

666
00:30:55,523 --> 00:30:56,883
But he wasn't
alone in this room

667
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,323
more than five minutes

668
00:30:58,403 --> 00:30:59,643
and he did fix
the lights.

669
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,083
They went on again.

670
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,403
The switch hasn't
been touched.

671
00:31:02,483 --> 00:31:05,163
The paint still covers
the screw heads.

672
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:07,043
He simply threw the main
switch in the basement,

673
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:08,803
pretended to
work on this one

674
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,123
and after a few moments

675
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:11,923
an accomplice threw
the main switch back on.

676
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,163
But in those few minutes

677
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:14,723
- Did you get a
look at his face?

678
00:31:14,803 --> 00:31:16,603
No, only a glance.

679
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:18,323
Now I realize he kept
his face averted.

680
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:19,443
But he was a large man?

681
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:20,403
Yes, he was large.

682
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:21,363
His eyes, heavy lidded,

683
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:22,723
a thin film
over the pupils.

684
00:31:22,803 --> 00:31:23,963
And Holmes...

685
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:25,203
I remember now.

686
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,763
His eyes, they were
like a snake's.

687
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:29,483
Miss Eberli,
Dr. Tobel is being held

688
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:30,883
by one of the
most brilliant men

689
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:32,083
in the history of crime.

690
00:31:32,163 --> 00:31:33,323
Come on, Watson.

691
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:34,563
There isn't a
moment to lose.

692
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,403
Goodbye Miss Eberli.

693
00:31:37,483 --> 00:31:38,403
Goodbye Miss Eberli.

694
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:41,643
I don't see why I'm not
allowed to go with you.

695
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:43,203
You have your own
mission, Watson.

696
00:31:43,283 --> 00:31:45,323
Yes, to take a sealed
note to Inspector Lestrade

697
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,803
while you search
through holes.

698
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:48,443
I shall not be
searching for him.

699
00:31:48,523 --> 00:31:50,483
I shall permit him to
find me in the character

700
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:52,963
of a murderous lascar
once in his employ

701
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,003
and whom I may add
is still in jail.

702
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,123
Yes, but after
all these years.

703
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:59,283
Make no mistake, Watson.

704
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:01,363
This is not a
duel of intellects

705
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:04,363
or the cruel
but single-minded
Gestapo killer.

706
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:06,323
This is our
greatest problem

707
00:32:06,403 --> 00:32:09,123
with England as the stake

708
00:32:09,203 --> 00:32:11,403
and our antagonist,

709
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,123
Professor Moriarity.

710
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,163
You've got to beat him.

711
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:17,283
Once he's behind bars

712
00:32:17,363 --> 00:32:19,043
I think I shall
entitle my memoirs

713
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:22,683
of these adventures
the end of Moriarity.

714
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:25,083
An excellent
title, Watson,

715
00:32:25,163 --> 00:32:30,083
but we must arrange
that it isn't Moriarity

716
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:32,043
who's left to
write the memoirs.

717
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,323
Huh?

718
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:06,443
Ramsing.

719
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:09,843
Ramsing?

720
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,883
Who know Ramsing?

721
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:15,803
I do, you blooming
wharf rat.

722
00:34:15,883 --> 00:34:17,403
You've been in
jail, ain't ya?

723
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,243
How you know?

724
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,123
I've heard from
the blighter

725
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:25,003
what left you to
swing instead of him.

726
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,923
You know who
I'm mean matey.

727
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:28,163
I know.

728
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:30,323
I'll have to kill him.

729
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:32,923
Would it be worth
ten pounds to you?

730
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,563
You know where he live?

731
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:36,123
For ten pound I know.

732
00:34:36,203 --> 00:34:37,363
I only got two.

733
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:40,843
Goodbye matey

734
00:34:40,923 --> 00:34:42,163
Five.

735
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:44,603
Ten pounds or nothing
you lying heathen.

736
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,083
You dirty...

737
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:48,243
Well it ain't
so much to ask,

738
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:51,403
for what you
want to know.

739
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:54,603
You make good bargain.

740
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,523
That does it.

741
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,363
Well?

742
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,963
You remember
Angel's Court.

743
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:07,403
Huh.

744
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:09,043
Then follow your nose
through the alley

745
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:11,843
till you come to Jed
Brady's Carpenter Shop.

746
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:13,803
He can tell you where
the blighter is

747
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:15,963
at this very moment.

748
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:16,923
You come too.

749
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:19,363
Me?

750
00:35:19,443 --> 00:35:20,723
If you lie.

751
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:22,043
All right, mister.

752
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:23,043
I'll come along with you.

753
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,643
Easy matey, easy.

754
00:35:25,683 --> 00:35:27,883
Follow me.

755
00:35:29,843 --> 00:35:31,363
Please governor.

756
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:32,603
I hadn't had nothing
to eat for two days.

757
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:34,723
Ah, go away.

758
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:53,843
Who's there?

759
00:35:53,923 --> 00:35:58,483
Peg leg.

760
00:35:58,563 --> 00:35:59,683
Who's this bloke?

761
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:01,683
He's a bloodthirsty
heathen

762
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:05,043
but has good money to
spend for information.

763
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,843
What's he want to know?

764
00:36:17,923 --> 00:36:20,163
He give me five pounds

765
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:22,563
to bring him to someone
what could tell him

766
00:36:22,643 --> 00:36:25,963
the whereabouts
of you know who.

767
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:28,883
You no tell me
I cut two throat.

768
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:31,043
Cost you another fiver.

769
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,163
Five pound more, eh?

770
00:36:33,243 --> 00:36:34,443
You pay him?

771
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:35,603
Me?

772
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:37,803
Come on you.

773
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,843
Come on pay him.

774
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,803
I'll tell you
all right I will,

775
00:36:51,883 --> 00:36:53,163
the truth and
that's a fact.

776
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,043
The blight is in
Davey Jones' locker

777
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:56,443
and feeding the
fishes he is,

778
00:36:56,523 --> 00:36:58,483
deader than a
blinking mackerel.

779
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,483
Now ain't that
worth a fiver?

780
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:07,083
I tell you he's alive.

781
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:11,003
And I say he's been
dead these many years.

782
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:14,403
You're lying.

783
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:16,003
Easy there Jack Brady.

784
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,323
I would say
you were wrong

785
00:37:17,363 --> 00:37:19,283
and Mr. Sherlock
Holmes was correct.

786
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,643
Good evening
Professor Moriarity.

787
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,123
Welcome, Holmes.

788
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,523
My men have the
instructions

789
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,523
to bring anybody here
who inquires for me.

790
00:37:26,603 --> 00:37:28,923
They haggled
while I watch,

791
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:30,883
an admirable
disguise by the way.

792
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:32,563
It fooled them completely.

793
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:34,003
Of course it
didn't fool me.

794
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:35,723
I never intended
that it should.

795
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,523
I meant only that
it should bring us

796
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:39,883
face to face.

797
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:41,883
Just like old times, eh?

798
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:45,363
The battle of wits of
superior intellects.

799
00:37:45,443 --> 00:37:47,083
I may say I've
been expecting you

800
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:49,243
since I made off with
your precious Dr. Tobel.

801
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:50,483
And his code.

802
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:51,683
Ah yes.

803
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:54,643
And his code.

804
00:37:54,723 --> 00:37:56,163
But valuable
as your doctor

805
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:58,443
and his code are
to my business

806
00:37:58,523 --> 00:38:01,323
I think my main
interest in this affair

807
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,963
is the chance it gives me

808
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,203
to battle with you again.

809
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:11,563
Moriarity,

810
00:38:11,603 --> 00:38:14,283
this is no simple crime
that you contemplate.

811
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:16,763
It's a staggering blow
against your own country.

812
00:38:16,843 --> 00:38:19,283
That doesn't
concern me overly.

813
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,403
I should make greater
profits from this affair

814
00:38:21,483 --> 00:38:23,923
than all my other
adventures put together.

815
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:25,203
Then you refuse?

816
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:27,843
Oh, most assuredly.

817
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:29,323
In fact,

818
00:38:29,403 --> 00:38:31,563
I intend to insure the
success of this venture

819
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,843
tonight by liquidating
you, Mr. Holmes.

820
00:38:34,923 --> 00:38:37,243
I think that is the
American phrase.

821
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:38,483
Quite.

822
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:39,883
You are the one man
intelligent enough

823
00:38:39,963 --> 00:38:42,203
to stand in my way.

824
00:38:42,283 --> 00:38:43,723
Huh, a gun.

825
00:38:43,803 --> 00:38:45,923
Oh, come now.

826
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:47,563
This is not the
Professor Moriarity,

827
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:50,043
the master criminal
I once knew.

828
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:51,563
A dock rat could
do as much.

829
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:53,443
Did you think I was going
to shoot you, Mr. Holmes?

830
00:38:53,523 --> 00:38:55,083
Oh, oh.

831
00:38:55,123 --> 00:38:56,883
Dear me no.

832
00:38:56,963 --> 00:39:00,043
This is simply to prevent
a troublesome scene.

833
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:01,443
I expected you,

834
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:04,803
and made full
arrangements.

835
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:07,203
You see my good
Mr. Holmes,

836
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:10,283
these shelves lift out

837
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:12,883
and you will rest
somewhat uncomfortably

838
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:16,043
in the false bottom
of this sea chest.

839
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,883
My sailor friend,
Jack Brady,

840
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:19,683
goes to sea immediately.

841
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:21,163
Once out of
sight of land

842
00:39:21,243 --> 00:39:24,963
he pushes the
chest overboard.

843
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,323
Tie him up.

844
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:31,683
Perhaps your good
friend, Dr. Watson,

845
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:33,563
can entitle
this adventure,

846
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:36,363
the end of
Sherlock Holmes.

847
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,043
He will be disappointed.

848
00:39:38,123 --> 00:39:39,483
He intended to call it

849
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:42,003
the end of
Professor Moriarity.

850
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:43,123
Hurry.

851
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:44,963
Aye, sir.

852
00:40:03,723 --> 00:40:06,043
Brilliant man
Sherlock Holmes.

853
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:08,483
Too bad he was honest.

854
00:40:11,963 --> 00:40:13,403
That one-legged man,

855
00:40:13,483 --> 00:40:14,803
he takes Mr. Holmes

856
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:16,683
right to that
carpenter shop.

857
00:40:16,723 --> 00:40:18,323
He knocks on the door.

858
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:20,803
A man comes out
and in they go.

859
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:21,963
Thank you, George.

860
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:23,083
We'll take over the watch.

861
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,243
Good night, Dr. Watson.

862
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:25,843
Good night.

863
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:29,643
What does Mr. Holmes

864
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:31,883
hope to accomplish
by this masquerade?

865
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,443
He hopes to
frighten Moriarity

866
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:35,523
into rushing Tobel into
another hiding place.

867
00:40:35,603 --> 00:40:37,963
Moriarity's dead,
I tell you.

868
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:39,683
Look out.

869
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:41,323
Over here, quick.

870
00:40:57,123 --> 00:40:58,443
Hey, just a minute.

871
00:40:58,483 --> 00:40:59,723
Who's there?

872
00:40:59,763 --> 00:41:00,923
What have you got there?

873
00:41:01,003 --> 00:41:01,883
Who's asking?

874
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:02,883
Scotland Yard.

875
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:04,203
Scot...

876
00:41:04,283 --> 00:41:06,283
governor, I'll
show you me papers.

877
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,043
There you are, governor.

878
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:17,523
I'm Jack Brady,
ship's carpenter.

879
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:19,043
Shipping out tonight
in the convoy,

880
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:20,763
destination unknown.

881
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:23,003
Me pal here is helping
me get the chest aboard.

882
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,203
Make him open
it, Lestrade.

883
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:25,763
Yes, or course.

884
00:41:25,843 --> 00:41:28,283
All right governor,

885
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:32,163
see for yourself.

886
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:33,523
There is nothing
here, doctor.

887
00:41:33,603 --> 00:41:35,563
Just a couple of
simple seafaring men.

888
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:36,683
All right get on with it.

889
00:41:36,763 --> 00:41:37,923
Thank you governor.

890
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:43,003
Come on, now.

891
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,203
Easy does it.

892
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:47,283
Right there.

893
00:41:47,363 --> 00:41:50,603
Good night, my lordships.

894
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,443
Told you it was a
lot of nonsense.

895
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:53,803
I don't understand.

896
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:55,243
That thing must
weight a ton.

897
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:56,883
Look at that
man staggering.

898
00:41:56,963 --> 00:41:58,363
Do you know
something, doctor.

899
00:41:58,443 --> 00:42:00,123
A few tools wouldn't
take that much energy.

900
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:01,483
We've just looked inside.

901
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:02,683
On the top only.

902
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:03,803
There might be
a false bottom.

903
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:05,123
Hey you, you stop there.

904
00:42:05,203 --> 00:42:07,043
Stop or I'll shoot.

905
00:42:22,403 --> 00:42:23,763
Great Scott, Holmes.

906
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:26,323
Well I'll be blowed.

907
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:28,163
You're not hurt.

908
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:29,683
No,

909
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:31,403
but you needn't
have yelled at
them so abruptly.

910
00:42:31,443 --> 00:42:32,483
Huh?

911
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:33,643
They dropped
me on my head.

912
00:42:33,683 --> 00:42:34,843
Oh.

913
00:42:34,923 --> 00:42:36,123
Moriarity would have
been delighted.

914
00:42:36,203 --> 00:42:38,043
So Professor
Moriarity is alive.

915
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:39,963
Alive and in possession
of Dr. Tobel's code.

916
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:41,163
No point going back,

917
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:42,403
they've all gone.

918
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:43,563
Then what are
you going to do?

919
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:44,803
Well first I'm going to

920
00:42:44,883 --> 00:42:46,123
wash this filthy
stuff off my face

921
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,563
and then I'm going to
see Miss Eberli again.

922
00:42:47,643 --> 00:42:48,403
I've got to
find some clue

923
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,683
to the content of
Dr. Tobel's message.

924
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:50,443
Come on quick.

925
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,163
I only got one
glimpse of the note

926
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:55,923
while he was
preparing it.

927
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:58,283
He was seated
at this desk?

928
00:42:58,323 --> 00:42:59,723
No, he was sitting
on the couch

929
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:01,163
when he wrote the message

930
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,203
but he sealed the
envelope here.

931
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:03,883
The message was written
in ink with this pen?

932
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,003
No he used a pencil.

933
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,163
This one.

934
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:09,123
Thank you.

935
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:10,123
He used this writing pad?

936
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:11,123
Yes.

937
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:12,083
Has it been used since?

938
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:14,523
No.

939
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:16,283
It should be here.

940
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:17,483
It must be here.

941
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:18,763
What, Mr. Holmes.

942
00:43:18,803 --> 00:43:20,043
The lead in this
pencil is hard,

943
00:43:20,123 --> 00:43:21,443
hard enough to
make an impression

944
00:43:21,523 --> 00:43:23,083
on the course
fibers of which

945
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:24,563
this paper is made.

946
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:29,643
Impressions at the
moment are invisible.

947
00:43:29,683 --> 00:43:31,203
If we immerse
this sheet

948
00:43:31,283 --> 00:43:33,363
in the solution
of florescent salts,

949
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,963
dry it and then
photograph it

950
00:43:36,043 --> 00:43:39,723
by ultraviolet light

951
00:43:39,763 --> 00:43:41,963
the fibers broken
by the writing

952
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:43,603
will absorbed less
of the solution

953
00:43:43,683 --> 00:43:46,723
than other parts
of the paper.

954
00:43:46,803 --> 00:43:49,203
Switch off the
lights, Watson.

955
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:55,763
We place the slide
in the projector

956
00:43:55,843 --> 00:43:59,603
and turn on the light.

957
00:43:59,683 --> 00:44:01,043
The broken fibers
appear darken

958
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:03,363
than the rest
of the paper

959
00:44:03,443 --> 00:44:04,803
and therefore visible.

960
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:06,163
Splendid, Holmes.

961
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:08,203
Now I recognize that code.

962
00:44:08,283 --> 00:44:10,203
Do you remember a case
we had some years ago?

963
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:11,523
It's partly the same,

964
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:12,763
alphabet
substitution code.

965
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:14,003
Yes, Watson.

966
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,403
I believe Dr. Tobel

967
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:16,963
meant to communicate
with us by that means.

968
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:18,443
Substitution of
the alphabet.

969
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,883
I don't understand.

970
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:21,443
My dear, one of the
oldest codes in use

971
00:44:21,523 --> 00:44:23,363
is based on the
repetition of figures.

972
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:26,043
E is a letter most used
in the British language

973
00:44:26,123 --> 00:44:28,843
therefore the single
most used probably

974
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:31,043
in this message is e.

975
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:34,243
T-a-o-i-n.

976
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:35,923
Follow in that
order of frequency.

977
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:37,523
You mean you can
read these figures

978
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:39,163
as if they were letters
of the alphabet.

979
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,803
Elementary, my
dear Miss Eberli.

980
00:44:40,883 --> 00:44:42,083
Give me one minute

981
00:44:42,163 --> 00:44:47,763
and you shall
have the message.

982
00:44:47,843 --> 00:44:49,763
And what is the
message, Watson?

983
00:44:49,843 --> 00:44:51,163
This fellow Tobel

984
00:44:51,243 --> 00:44:52,603
must have been
pulling our legs.

985
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:54,283
There's a lot
of gibberish.

986
00:44:54,323 --> 00:44:57,323
L-y-z-l-m-t-h-k.

987
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,163
Reads like an eye
doctor's chart.

988
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:00,643
Dr. Tobel is a
brilliant scientist.

989
00:45:00,723 --> 00:45:02,603
I saw immediately that
he wouldn't send us

990
00:45:02,643 --> 00:45:04,403
a message so
simple to decipher.

991
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:06,003
Neither would he have
fixed these top figures

992
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,483
without a meaning.

993
00:45:07,563 --> 00:45:08,883
Then it isn't the alphabet
substitution code.

994
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:10,243
Yes it is, Watson,

995
00:45:10,323 --> 00:45:12,123
but with a very
clever variation.

996
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:14,363
You see the one,
two, three figures

997
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:16,643
means that we skip
letters in that order.

998
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:18,643
In other words,
observe Watson.

999
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:23,123
The first letter, which
is I skips one, becomes J.

1000
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:27,043
The second letter, Y,
skips two and becomes A

1001
00:45:27,123 --> 00:45:29,403
and the third skips
three and becomes C.

1002
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:30,883
J-a-c...

1003
00:45:30,963 --> 00:45:37,603
J-a-c-o-b, D-u-r-r-e-i.

1004
00:45:37,683 --> 00:45:38,923
Jacob Durrei, a
Swiss scientist

1005
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:41,043
and friend of
Dr. Tobel's.

1006
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:49,163
P-a-l-a-c-e, C-r-e-s...

1007
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:50,443
Palace Crescent.

1008
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:51,563
Right.

1009
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:52,843
I say Holmes,

1010
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,323
this man, Durrei,
must be important.

1011
00:45:54,363 --> 00:45:55,603
Obviously, Watson.

1012
00:45:55,683 --> 00:45:57,803
He must have some
connection with
the bomb sight

1013
00:45:57,843 --> 00:45:59,483
or Tobel wouldn't have
taken so much trouble

1014
00:45:59,563 --> 00:46:00,803
to see that
I got his name.

1015
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,563
Take down the rest
of the message.

1016
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:08,443
J-o-s-e-p-h, Joseph.

1017
00:46:08,523 --> 00:46:12,603
E-m-d-d-i-a-c,

1018
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:14,203
number four doesn't
make any sense.

1019
00:46:14,283 --> 00:46:16,803
He must have used
some other variations.

1020
00:46:20,483 --> 00:46:22,483
Four names and addresses,

1021
00:46:22,563 --> 00:46:23,683
Jacob Durrei,

1022
00:46:23,763 --> 00:46:24,883
Professor Fallow,

1023
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:26,283
Dr. Kern

1024
00:46:26,323 --> 00:46:27,763
and this forth
infernal cipher

1025
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:32,163
which doesn't
get the code.

1026
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:35,363
Christmas boxes.

1027
00:46:35,443 --> 00:46:39,563
Watson, I'm beginning
to see the plan.

1028
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:43,283
Dr. Tobel divided his
bomb sight into four parts

1029
00:46:43,363 --> 00:46:46,123
just as we brought it
back from Switzerland.

1030
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,363
He's given one section
of the mechanism

1031
00:46:48,443 --> 00:46:51,083
to each of these
famous scientists.

1032
00:46:51,163 --> 00:46:53,003
What a fascinating plan.

1033
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,403
You see each
part is useless

1034
00:46:55,443 --> 00:46:56,843
without the other three

1035
00:46:56,923 --> 00:46:58,603
and undoubtedly none
of these scientists

1036
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:00,043
is known to each other.

1037
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:03,123
Professor Moriarity
also has the code

1038
00:47:03,203 --> 00:47:06,283
and we must allow for his
ability to decipher it.

1039
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:09,203
We haven't time to break
the fourth code now.

1040
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:10,763
We must get to the
first three men

1041
00:47:10,843 --> 00:47:12,043
before Moriarity does.

1042
00:47:12,123 --> 00:47:13,323
Palace Crescent first?

1043
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,443
Right.

1044
00:47:14,523 --> 00:47:15,603
I'll go and get a taxi.

1045
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:16,803
Miss Eberli,

1046
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:17,963
will you please wait
here till we return?

1047
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,203
Thank you.

1048
00:47:26,203 --> 00:47:27,603
Yeah, where are
you going, sir?

1049
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:28,963
Jacob Durrei live here?

1050
00:47:29,043 --> 00:47:30,283
Yes, but there's
been a bit of trouble

1051
00:47:30,323 --> 00:47:31,403
so you can't go in.

1052
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:32,643
Inspector
Lestrade's orders.

1053
00:47:32,723 --> 00:47:33,843
Oh, Hey, just
a minute, sir.

1054
00:47:33,923 --> 00:47:35,083
That's Mr.
Sherlock Holmes.

1055
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:37,003
Oh, very sorry, sir.

1056
00:47:43,283 --> 00:47:44,403
Dead?

1057
00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:46,203
Dead as a door nail.

1058
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:48,283
Mr. Holmes, how did
you know about this?

1059
00:47:48,363 --> 00:47:49,803
The Yard only got here
fifteen minutes ago.

1060
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:51,083
We'd better hurry Holmes.

1061
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,883
There's still time to
save Fallow and Kern.

1062
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,163
Too late, Watson.

1063
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:55,883
By this time Fallow
and Kern are dead too.

1064
00:47:55,963 --> 00:47:56,963
What?

1065
00:47:57,043 --> 00:47:58,163
Deductions again,
Mr. Holmes?

1066
00:47:58,243 --> 00:47:59,243
Facts Inspector.

1067
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:01,483
Oh, facts.

1068
00:48:04,083 --> 00:48:05,723
But how did you
know about them?

1069
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:07,043
Elementary, my
dear Watson.

1070
00:48:07,123 --> 00:48:08,603
This man has been dead
for at least two hours

1071
00:48:08,683 --> 00:48:10,123
and Moriarity isn't
wasting any time.

1072
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:11,323
Hello?

1073
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:12,803
This is Lestrade.

1074
00:48:12,883 --> 00:48:14,603
Put me on to Mackety.

1075
00:48:14,643 --> 00:48:19,363
Hello, Mackety, hello,
this is Lestrade.

1076
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,563
Do you know anything
about two men named

1077
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:23,203
Fallow and Kern?

1078
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:25,643
Fallow and Kern?

1079
00:48:28,523 --> 00:48:31,363
Both of them?

1080
00:48:31,443 --> 00:48:34,123
Oh.

1081
00:48:34,163 --> 00:48:37,363
Thank you.

1082
00:48:37,443 --> 00:48:38,803
The report only came in

1083
00:48:38,883 --> 00:48:40,443
two seconds before
I telephoned.

1084
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:42,003
What on earth are we
going to do, Holmes?

1085
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:44,083
Moriarity's got
a big start and
he's got the code?

1086
00:48:44,163 --> 00:48:45,483
Note this Watson.

1087
00:48:45,563 --> 00:48:47,043
Scotland Yard reports
two murderers.

1088
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:48,483
That makes three in all.

1089
00:48:48,563 --> 00:48:50,203
But there were four
boxes and four codes.

1090
00:48:50,283 --> 00:48:51,603
Obviously Moriarity

1091
00:48:51,683 --> 00:48:54,043
hasn't broken the
fourth code either.

1092
00:49:02,803 --> 00:49:04,483
What is the name
of the fourth man?

1093
00:49:04,563 --> 00:49:05,963
I can't remember.

1094
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,403
What is the name
of the fourth man?

1095
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:09,963
I have forgotten.

1096
00:49:10,043 --> 00:49:11,643
What is the name
of the fourth man?

1097
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:12,923
I don't know.

1098
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:14,403
I don't know.

1099
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:15,883
What is the name
of the fourth man?

1100
00:49:15,923 --> 00:49:18,883
I can't remember.

1101
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:20,163
What is the name
of the fourth man?

1102
00:49:20,243 --> 00:49:21,283
What is the name
of the fourth man?

1103
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:24,363
But Holmes,

1104
00:49:24,403 --> 00:49:25,883
don't you realize what
this means to England?

1105
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,563
We not only lose the
Tobel bomb sight ourselves

1106
00:49:27,603 --> 00:49:29,443
but Germany gets it.

1107
00:49:29,523 --> 00:49:31,323
Coventry, Bath,
Plymouth, London.

1108
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:32,883
And not to
mention Norigno.

1109
00:49:32,963 --> 00:49:37,283
All over again but with
ten times the effect.

1110
00:49:37,363 --> 00:49:38,683
Don't you suppose
I realize that,

1111
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:40,683
Sir Reginald?

1112
00:49:40,763 --> 00:49:42,203
Don't you suppose
I give my life

1113
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:44,083
to decode the last
name of that message?

1114
00:49:44,163 --> 00:49:45,683
Well there must
be some solution.

1115
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:47,163
Naturally, Watson.

1116
00:49:47,243 --> 00:49:49,323
I don't mean to be
rude, I need a drink.

1117
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,883
I'm all in.

1118
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:52,203
I can't think anymore.

1119
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:53,843
All these letters
and figures

1120
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:56,603
running through my brain
all twisted around.

1121
00:49:59,723 --> 00:50:00,843
Twisted around.

1122
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:01,843
What?

1123
00:50:01,923 --> 00:50:02,883
That's it.

1124
00:50:02,963 --> 00:50:04,203
That's what?

1125
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:05,523
Twisted around you said.

1126
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,323
It's so simple I
never thought of it.

1127
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:10,163
Reverse the slide.

1128
00:50:10,243 --> 00:50:12,923
You see, gentlemen.

1129
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:14,643
These figures
are now identical

1130
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,083
with the first
three names.

1131
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:17,363
In other words,

1132
00:50:17,443 --> 00:50:18,763
all the figures of
name number four

1133
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:20,203
are written backwards

1134
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,643
and read from
right to left

1135
00:50:21,683 --> 00:50:23,163
until we reverse
the slide

1136
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:26,443
when they read correctly
from left to right.

1137
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,603
Now let's work on it.

1138
00:50:27,683 --> 00:50:29,523
Pencil Watson.

1139
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:32,243
But, um, why
would Dr. Tobel

1140
00:50:32,323 --> 00:50:35,323
want to reverse the
figures of number four.

1141
00:50:35,403 --> 00:50:36,803
An added
precaution, Lestrade

1142
00:50:36,883 --> 00:50:39,003
in case the cipher should
fall into the wrong hands.

1143
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,643
Quite a compliment
to you, Mr. Holmes.

1144
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:44,203
I mean, Tobel
taken for granted

1145
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:46,443
that you would
recognize the difference.

1146
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:47,603
Thank you.

1147
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:49,123
Ohh.

1148
00:50:49,203 --> 00:50:54,683
F-r-e-d-e-r-i-c-k,

1149
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:58,443
H-o-f-f-n-e-r,

1150
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:00,003
Frederick Hoffner.

1151
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:05,003
S-l-o-a-n-e S-q-u...

1152
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,603
Sloane Square.

1153
00:51:06,683 --> 00:51:07,763
We must leave at once.

1154
00:51:07,843 --> 00:51:09,003
Wait a minute.

1155
00:51:13,243 --> 00:51:14,923
Information?

1156
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,603
Will you please
give me the address

1157
00:51:16,683 --> 00:51:18,163
of a Frederick Hoffner

1158
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:19,843
in Sloane Square.

1159
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:23,883
I'll break this code.

1160
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:25,323
I'll find the name
of that fourth man

1161
00:51:25,403 --> 00:51:27,963
before Holmes does.

1162
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,643
There is not
much more time.

1163
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:31,683
The submarine is to
pick us up off Shanese

1164
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:33,163
in six hours.

1165
00:51:33,243 --> 00:51:34,603
I've beaten Holmes so far.

1166
00:51:34,643 --> 00:51:36,323
We don't need the
confounded submarine

1167
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:37,923
with the bomber
sight in tact.

1168
00:51:38,003 --> 00:51:40,523
But Tobel is
unconscious again.

1169
00:51:40,603 --> 00:51:42,563
As last resort we
could abandon the code

1170
00:51:42,643 --> 00:51:44,763
and take Tobel
to Germany.

1171
00:51:44,843 --> 00:51:47,443
We'll try Tobel
again in here.

1172
00:51:50,403 --> 00:51:52,403
Wait.

1173
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:53,923
Spilling that
glass of water

1174
00:51:54,003 --> 00:51:55,283
was a very
fortunate accident,

1175
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,043
my dear street brawler.

1176
00:51:57,123 --> 00:51:58,763
Dr. Tobel's perversion
of the cipher

1177
00:51:58,843 --> 00:52:01,443
was so simple
that it fooled us.

1178
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:03,323
I was looking for
something ingenious.

1179
00:52:03,403 --> 00:52:05,283
This is ingenious.

1180
00:52:05,363 --> 00:52:09,963
He simply
reversed the cipher.

1181
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:18,003
F-r-e-d-e-r-i-c-k,

1182
00:52:18,083 --> 00:52:25,323
H-o-f-f-n-e-r,

1183
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:30,523
S-l-o-a-n-e.

1184
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:34,403
Frederick Hoffner,
Sloane Square.

1185
00:52:34,483 --> 00:52:36,043
Of course.

1186
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,163
Hoffner would be the
perfect selection.

1187
00:52:38,243 --> 00:52:40,643
Then you want us
to tend to Hoffner?

1188
00:52:40,683 --> 00:52:42,203
No, we can use Hoffner.

1189
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:43,683
He's a brilliant
scientist.

1190
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:46,603
If Dr. Tobel
doesn't recover from
your persuasion,

1191
00:52:46,643 --> 00:52:48,043
Hoffner would be able

1192
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:49,563
to put the four
parts together.

1193
00:52:49,643 --> 00:52:51,043
You and Godfrey
will call on Hoffner

1194
00:52:51,123 --> 00:52:52,603
and you will
bring him here

1195
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,283
with the fourth section
of the bomb sight.

1196
00:52:54,363 --> 00:52:56,163
Hurry.

1197
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:18,763
Put up your hands,
Professor Hoffner.

1198
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,763
I'll take the box.

1199
00:54:19,563 --> 00:54:21,843
We Meet again, Professor.

1200
00:54:28,883 --> 00:54:31,603
Sherlock Holmes.

1201
00:54:31,683 --> 00:54:33,443
An improvement on
the other make-up.

1202
00:54:33,523 --> 00:54:37,003
Don't you think
so, Professor.

1203
00:54:37,043 --> 00:54:38,963
So you think you've
beaten me, Holmes?

1204
00:54:39,003 --> 00:54:40,403
I have.

1205
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:41,883
The real Hoffner
is safely

1206
00:54:41,963 --> 00:54:43,243
in the hands of
Scotland Yard.

1207
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:44,803
But I still have Tobel

1208
00:54:44,883 --> 00:54:47,083
and now I shall sell
Germany the inventor

1209
00:54:47,163 --> 00:54:48,843
instead of the invention.

1210
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:50,243
You've learned
nothing from him

1211
00:54:50,283 --> 00:54:51,763
in spite of all
your torture

1212
00:54:51,843 --> 00:54:53,483
otherwise you wouldn't
be trying so desperately

1213
00:54:53,563 --> 00:54:55,323
to collect the
four sections of
the bomb sight.

1214
00:54:55,403 --> 00:54:57,723
A keen observation,
my dear Holmes,

1215
00:54:57,803 --> 00:55:00,843
but observe further that
you are now in my hands

1216
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,403
and I have profited
by my last mistake

1217
00:55:03,483 --> 00:55:06,123
by allowing underlings
to attend to you.

1218
00:55:06,163 --> 00:55:07,523
Holmes took my place

1219
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:09,323
and while the Nazis
were inside with him

1220
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,523
he instructed me to
attach a small apparatus

1221
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:12,963
underneath their car.

1222
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,283
He's a brilliant
fellow, Holmes.

1223
00:55:14,363 --> 00:55:15,723
I helped him prepare
the apparatus.

1224
00:55:15,763 --> 00:55:16,963
Did you really, doctor?

1225
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:18,243
That is I poured
the luminous paint

1226
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,563
when he told me to.

1227
00:55:19,603 --> 00:55:20,843
Very clever, Dr. Watson.

1228
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:22,363
The apparatus drips
at regular intervals

1229
00:55:22,443 --> 00:55:24,123
leaving a trail
of luminous paint.

1230
00:55:24,203 --> 00:55:25,203
I see.

1231
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:28,043
Leading us to Moriarity
and Mr. Holmes.

1232
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:40,283
Why are you so
confident, Professor?

1233
00:55:40,363 --> 00:55:41,803
Only a suggestion.

1234
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:43,403
But how do you know
that Scotland Yard

1235
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:44,683
isn't waiting to break in

1236
00:55:44,723 --> 00:55:46,123
at this very moment?

1237
00:55:46,163 --> 00:55:47,683
I selected this address
with special care.

1238
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:49,123
No one can find it,

1239
00:55:49,203 --> 00:55:51,323
not even Scotland Yard.

1240
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:53,803
Relax, Mr. Holmes.

1241
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:57,403
There's no escape.

1242
00:55:57,483 --> 00:56:00,163
And I'd suddenly
dash to the window

1243
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,563
and break it open and
shout to a passerby.

1244
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:04,843
There are no passersby.

1245
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:07,003
The glass in the
window is unbreakable

1246
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:09,003
and the room
is soundproof.

1247
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:11,443
This is my
stronghold, Holmes,

1248
00:56:11,523 --> 00:56:13,763
equipped with all the
modern conveniences

1249
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,803
of a successful man
in my profession.

1250
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:18,683
Sit down.

1251
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:29,483
They cleared
up again, sir.

1252
00:56:33,963 --> 00:56:36,003
I don't understand,
Lestrade.

1253
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:37,883
It stopped

1254
00:56:37,963 --> 00:56:40,083
and then it started

1255
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,803
and now it stopped again.

1256
00:56:41,843 --> 00:56:43,443
Maybe the apparatus
broke down.

1257
00:56:43,523 --> 00:56:45,123
Oh, a suggestion,
gentlemen.

1258
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:47,003
At a crossroad back there

1259
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,163
a car might have gone
over the spots of paint,

1260
00:56:49,203 --> 00:56:50,963
picked some up
on the tires

1261
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:52,523
and left this false trail.

1262
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:53,763
Just what
I was about to...

1263
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,803
Just what I was about
to suggest myself.

1264
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:57,123
Very well.

1265
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:57,883
We'll try it.

1266
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:08,043
Now Holmes,
what will it be?

1267
00:57:08,123 --> 00:57:09,323
The gas chamber,

1268
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:10,563
a cup of hemlock

1269
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:14,003
or just a simple bullet
through your brain?

1270
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,123
You disappoint
me, professor.

1271
00:57:16,203 --> 00:57:18,043
Indeed.

1272
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:19,683
Yes.

1273
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:24,323
Somehow I always
thought that in the end

1274
00:57:24,403 --> 00:57:26,683
you'd prove to be just
an ordinary cutthroat.

1275
00:57:26,763 --> 00:57:29,003
You know me
better, Holmes.

1276
00:57:29,043 --> 00:57:31,803
Gas, poison, bullets.

1277
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:33,603
I assure you, professor,

1278
00:57:33,643 --> 00:57:35,643
were our
position's reversed

1279
00:57:35,723 --> 00:57:37,563
I should have something
more colorful,

1280
00:57:37,643 --> 00:57:40,203
more imaginative to offer.

1281
00:57:40,283 --> 00:57:42,283
I'm satisfied to
be the winner.

1282
00:57:42,363 --> 00:57:43,963
I shall be alive.

1283
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,323
Alive, yes,

1284
00:57:45,363 --> 00:57:47,003
the winner, no,

1285
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,403
for in the last analysis

1286
00:57:48,483 --> 00:57:50,323
I shall have proved the
more resourceful man.

1287
00:57:50,403 --> 00:57:52,403
You didn't trap me here.

1288
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:54,403
I came here because
I wanted to,

1289
00:57:54,483 --> 00:57:56,043
to prevent your
getting Hoffner

1290
00:57:56,123 --> 00:57:57,603
and all you can
do in return

1291
00:57:57,643 --> 00:57:59,403
is to commit
ordinary murder

1292
00:57:59,483 --> 00:58:01,283
to relieve your sense
of frustration.

1293
00:58:01,323 --> 00:58:03,363
And what, my
good Mr. Holmes,

1294
00:58:03,443 --> 00:58:05,163
could you have conceived

1295
00:58:05,243 --> 00:58:07,603
that would have been
so much more colorful?

1296
00:58:07,683 --> 00:58:09,323
Well even offhand

1297
00:58:09,363 --> 00:58:11,563
I can improve upon your
suggestions considerably,

1298
00:58:11,643 --> 00:58:13,043
but that's only
natural of course.

1299
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:16,563
And what is this
brilliant idea of yours?

1300
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:18,083
You know that a man dies

1301
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:19,683
if he loses five
pints of blood?

1302
00:58:19,723 --> 00:58:21,683
Yes, of course you do.

1303
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:24,163
I should have you placed
on an operating table,

1304
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:25,683
inject a needle
into your veins

1305
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:29,563
and slowly draw off
your life's blood.

1306
00:58:29,643 --> 00:58:32,963
The needle to the
last, ay, Holmes?

1307
00:58:33,003 --> 00:58:35,163
Slowly, drop-by-drop

1308
00:58:35,243 --> 00:58:37,523
the blood would be
drawn from your body.

1309
00:58:37,603 --> 00:58:39,763
You would be aware of
every exquisite second

1310
00:58:39,843 --> 00:58:41,443
to the very end.

1311
00:58:41,523 --> 00:58:43,083
You would be
watching yourself die

1312
00:58:43,163 --> 00:58:45,123
scientifically noting
every reaction

1313
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:48,763
and in full possession
of your faculties.

1314
00:58:48,843 --> 00:58:51,603
Interesting.

1315
00:58:51,683 --> 00:58:53,483
Yes, isn't it.

1316
00:58:53,523 --> 00:58:54,923
I humbly submit,
professor,

1317
00:58:55,003 --> 00:58:56,443
that to the very end

1318
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:59,843
I've been more
resourceful than yourself.

1319
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:01,803
You've played
into my hands,

1320
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:03,523
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

1321
00:59:03,603 --> 00:59:05,203
Time and again I've
used this place

1322
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:06,763
as a haven for
friends of mine

1323
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:11,203
injured in alterations
with Scotland Yard.

1324
00:59:11,283 --> 00:59:14,923
I have a fully
equipped hospital here.

1325
00:59:32,483 --> 00:59:35,083
The trail goes this
way, inspector.

1326
00:59:43,443 --> 00:59:45,763
Drop by drop, Holmes.

1327
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:49,763
Drop by drop.

1328
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:53,803
Ahh, in a way
I'm almost sorry.

1329
00:59:53,843 --> 00:59:57,323
You were a stimulating
influence to me

1330
00:59:57,403 --> 01:00:00,603
but it was obvious that
I should win in the end.

1331
01:00:04,283 --> 01:00:05,963
Only a matter
of moments now.

1332
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:07,563
Take Tobel down
to the boat.

1333
01:00:07,643 --> 01:00:09,043
Start the engine.

1334
01:00:18,683 --> 01:00:21,043
Closer to the end Holmes,

1335
01:00:21,123 --> 01:00:24,803
closer and closer.

1336
01:00:24,843 --> 01:00:28,683
Each second a few
more drops leave your

1337
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:30,123
desiccated body

1338
01:00:30,163 --> 01:00:32,123
ending,

1339
01:00:32,203 --> 01:00:35,963
you can feel
me touch you.

1340
01:00:36,043 --> 01:00:37,803
You're perfectly
conscious

1341
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:40,123
aren't you, Holmes?

1342
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,323
I shall be conscious

1343
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:45,283
long after you're
dead, Moriarity.

1344
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:46,603
Ahh.

1345
01:00:46,683 --> 01:00:48,163
Still the same old

1346
01:00:48,243 --> 01:00:50,443
swaggering conceded
Sherlock Holmes.

1347
01:01:02,723 --> 01:01:04,643
Wait.

1348
01:01:08,363 --> 01:01:09,963
If Moriarity hears a shot

1349
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:11,803
he'll kill Holmes.

1350
01:01:11,883 --> 01:01:13,123
You keep an eye
on the boat.

1351
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,323
Don't make a move

1352
01:01:14,403 --> 01:01:15,763
till Dr. Watson
and I get inside.

1353
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:17,163
Understand?

1354
01:01:17,243 --> 01:01:18,723
You wait here,
Professor Hoffner.

1355
01:01:18,803 --> 01:01:20,443
Come on doctor.

1356
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:37,483
The water's this way.

1357
01:01:37,523 --> 01:01:40,203
Moriarity's rooms
must be up here.

1358
01:01:47,763 --> 01:01:50,243
I can't wait any
longer, Holmes.

1359
01:01:55,923 --> 01:01:58,603
You'll have to forgive
the crudity my friend.

1360
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,883
This is only the
coups de gras.

1361
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:05,603
[Shot]

1362
01:02:05,643 --> 01:02:06,963
Stay still, Moriarity.

1363
01:02:07,043 --> 01:02:08,803
You're done for.

1364
01:02:08,883 --> 01:02:10,283
Holmes!

1365
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:11,483
On the contrary,
inspector,

1366
01:02:11,563 --> 01:02:12,883
my men are outside.

1367
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,443
It's you who are done for.

1368
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:15,923
Really?

1369
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:18,603
Just take a look
out the window

1370
01:02:18,683 --> 01:02:21,123
and see for yourself.

1371
01:02:28,763 --> 01:02:30,363
He's trying to get
to the speedboat.

1372
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:32,923
Yes, he won't go
without Tobel.

1373
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,603
Wait.

1374
01:02:49,323 --> 01:02:51,043
Here's Dr.
Tobel, inspector.

1375
01:02:51,123 --> 01:02:52,683
He ain't too badly hurt.

1376
01:02:52,763 --> 01:02:54,003
Thank heavens for that.

1377
01:02:54,083 --> 01:02:55,323
Look after him
will you Hoffner?

1378
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:57,203
I'll take him to the car.

1379
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:17,043
Well I expected you

1380
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:18,563
but not with my revolver.

1381
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:19,923
You realize, of course,

1382
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:21,683
when I was brought into
the room blindfolded

1383
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:23,563
I heard the mechanism
of this door.

1384
01:03:23,603 --> 01:03:24,683
Of course.

1385
01:03:24,763 --> 01:03:25,923
And yet knowing
that I'd heard it

1386
01:03:25,963 --> 01:03:27,283
you planned this
way of escape.

1387
01:03:27,363 --> 01:03:29,083
Not very flattering to me.

1388
01:03:29,163 --> 01:03:30,603
Suicide my dear professor.

1389
01:03:30,683 --> 01:03:32,363
Not at all, my
dear Holmes.

1390
01:03:32,403 --> 01:03:35,483
You see this is not an
ordinary passageway.

1391
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:37,323
Oh, my mistake.

1392
01:03:37,363 --> 01:03:38,803
It has been equally
well prepared

1393
01:03:38,883 --> 01:03:40,843
as the rest of my
humble quarters.

1394
01:03:40,923 --> 01:03:42,483
I have a trap set,

1395
01:03:42,563 --> 01:03:44,163
electric eye principle.

1396
01:03:44,203 --> 01:03:46,243
My passing through
will break the beam

1397
01:03:46,283 --> 01:03:48,083
and automatically open
the highly deceptive

1398
01:03:48,163 --> 01:03:51,723
trap door behind
me, of course.

1399
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:54,643
My pursuer, meaning
you my dear Holmes,

1400
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:56,003
will then be plunged

1401
01:03:56,043 --> 01:03:57,683
sixty feet into
the sewers below.

1402
01:03:57,763 --> 01:03:59,083
Holmes.

1403
01:04:04,963 --> 01:04:07,403
Holmes.

1404
01:04:07,483 --> 01:04:09,443
Poor Moriarity.

1405
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:11,923
I neglected to warn him.

1406
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:13,403
It seems some
careless person

1407
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,243
came across his trap door

1408
01:04:15,323 --> 01:04:17,283
and left it open.

1409
01:04:17,363 --> 01:04:19,843
Come along, Watson.

1410
01:04:28,043 --> 01:04:30,603
Germany wanted the
Tobel bomb sight,

1411
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,163
but will send her
thousands of them

1412
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,483
in our airplanes.

1413
01:04:34,563 --> 01:04:38,683
Yes, thanks to
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

1414
01:04:38,763 --> 01:04:40,923
and to Mrs. Tobel.

1415
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:43,363
And, of course,
Inspector Lestrade.

1416
01:04:43,443 --> 01:04:45,323
Oh well, that's
all right, Miss.

1417
01:04:49,643 --> 01:04:51,403
Things are looking
up, Holmes.

1418
01:04:51,443 --> 01:04:53,683
This little islands
still on the map.

1419
01:04:53,763 --> 01:04:56,523
Yes.

1420
01:04:56,603 --> 01:05:02,363
This fortress built
by nature for herself,

1421
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:04,723
this blessed plot,

1422
01:05:04,803 --> 01:05:07,523
this earth, this realm,

1423
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:09,683
this England.
