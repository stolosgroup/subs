Ass!

00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,198
I just...

6
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,539
I was told...

7
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,207
Have you seen...
I was told that if...

8
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,211
I was late again I would be
summarily dismissed.

9
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:37,597
No, no.

10
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,532

20
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,227
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

21
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,438
Ahh... we have
sort of a problem here.

22
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:27,941
Yeah.
You apparently didn't put...

23
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:30,360
one of the new cover sheets
on your T.P.S. reports.

24
00:04:30,443 --> 00:04:34,280
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I... I forgot.

25
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:36,199
Mmm... yeah.

26
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,742
You see, we're putting
the cover sheets...

27
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,703
on all T.P.S. reports now
before they go out.

28
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:43,540
Did you see the memo
about this?

29
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:46,877
Yeah. Yeah,
I have the memo right here.

30
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:48,379
I just, uh, forgot...

31
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,840
but, uh, it's not shipping out
till tomorrow...

32
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,341
so there's no problem.

33
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,176
Yeah.

34
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,636
If you could just go ahead
and make sure...

35
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,889
you do that from now on,
that would be great...

36
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:00,891
and, uh, I'll go ahead
and make sure...

37
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:03,102
you get another copy
of that memo, OK?

38
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:06,188
No. I have the memo.
I've got it... lt's right...

39
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,858
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

40
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,025
Um...

41
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,153
I came by here yesterday...

42
00:05:13,237 --> 00:05:16,073
Four teams
out on the Spanish point...

43
00:05:16,156 --> 00:05:18,326
discovered a shipwreck
off the coast...

44
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,578
Milton?

45
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:21,746
Hi. Uh...

46
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,832
could you turn that down
just a little bit?

47
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:26,126
But I was told
that I could listen...

48
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:28,837
to the radio at a reasonable
volume from 9:00 to 11:00.

49
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,423
Yeah. I know you're allowed to.

50
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,885
I was just thinkin'
maybe like a personal favour.

51
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:38,597
Well, I... I... I told Bill
if Sandra's going to...

52
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,100
listen to her headphones
while she's filing...

53
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,768
then I should be able
to listen to the radio...

54
00:05:43,852 --> 00:05:45,270
while I'm collating...

55
00:05:45,353 --> 00:05:47,355
so I don't see why I should have
to turn down the radio.

56
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,524
Yeah. All right. OK.

57
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,735
I enjoy listening
at a reasonable volume...

58
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:51,903
Thanks.

59
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:53,321
From 9:00 to 11:00.

60
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:54,822
Hi, Peter.

61
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,866
What's happening?

62
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,452
We need to talk
about your T.P.S. reports.

63
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:01,871
Yeah. The cover sheet.
I know. I know.

64
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:03,039
Bill talked to me about it.

65
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:05,666
Yeah. Did you get that memo?

66
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,002
Yeah, I got the memo,
and I understand the policy...

67
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:10,671
and the problem is just
that I forgot the one time...

68
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,590
and I've already
taken care of it...

69
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,383
so it's not even really
a problem anymore.

70
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:17,261
Ah! Yeah.

71
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:18,846
It's just we're putting
new cover sheets...

72
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,350
on all the T.P.S. reports
before they go out now...

73
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:23,810
so if you could go ahead
and try to remember...

74
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:26,480
to do that from now on,
that'd be great.

75
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:27,731
All right!

76
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:34,321
Just a moment.

77
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:38,200
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

78
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:39,493
Peter Gibbons.

79
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:41,662
Yes.

80
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,622
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

81
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:44,790
Just a moment.

82
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,291
I have the memo.

83
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,128
No. Not again. I...

84
00:06:50,212 --> 00:06:52,507
Why does it say paper jam
when there is no paper jam?

85
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,551
I swear to God,
one of these days...

86
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:57,679
I just kick this piece of shit
out the window.

87
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,681
You and me both, man.

88
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:00,974
That thing is lucky
I'm not armed.

89
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:04,435
Piece of shit.

90
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,396
"Samir...

91
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,982
"Na-Na...

92
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:10,817
"Na-Naga..."

93
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,652
No. Thanks.

94
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:13,987
Please.

95
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,156
"Michael... Bolton"?

96
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,408
That's me.

97
00:07:18,491 --> 00:07:20,577
Wow! Is that your real name?

98
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,079
Yeah. Ahem.

99
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:24,915
So are you related
to that singer guy?

100
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,792
No.
It's just a coincidence.

101
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,756
No one in this country
can pronounce my name right.

102
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,967
It's not that hard.

103
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,178
"Na-ee" and then "anajaad."
Nayanajaad.

104
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:39,263
At least your name
isn't Michael Bolton.

105
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:42,141
You know, there's
nothing wrong with that name.

106
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,143
There was
nothing wrong with it...

107
00:07:44,226 --> 00:07:45,895
until I was
about twelve years old...

108
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:48,189
and that no-talent
ass clown became famous...

109
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:49,398
and started winning Grammys.

110
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:54,654
Well, why don't you just go
by Mike instead of Michael?

111
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:56,907
Why should I change?
He's the one who sucks.

112
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,325
Hey, guys.

113
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,993
What's up, G?

114
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,995
Wanna go to Chotchkie's,
get some coffee?

115
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:03,580
Oh, it's a little early.

116
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:06,041
I gotta get outta here.
I think I'm gonna lose it.

117
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:10,128
Sounds like somebody's
got a case of the Mondays.

118
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:17,177
Boy, I tell ya, some days.

119
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,262
One of these days,
it's just gonna be like...

120
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,267
Heh heh heh!

121
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,269
So, can I get you gentlemen
something more to drink...

122
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:26,437
or maybe something
to nibble on...

123
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,023
some pizza shooters, shrimp
poppers, or extreme fajitas?

124
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,067
- Just coffee.
- OK!

125
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,985
Sounds like a case
of the Mondays.

126
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:41,827
What if we're still doin' this
when we're fifty?

127
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:44,580
It would be nice to have
that kind of job security.

128
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:46,832
Lumbergh's gonna have me work
on Saturday.

129
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,834
I can tell already.

130
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:51,003
I'm gonna end up doin' it,
because, uh...

131
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,880
because I'm a big pussy...

132
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:55,008
which is why I work
at Initech to begin with.

133
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:56,718
Uh, yeah, well,
I work at Initech...

134
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,846
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

135
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,265
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

136
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,475
They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

137
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,185
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

138
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,812
That's right.

139
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,480
They don't understand.

140
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:10,649
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

141
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:12,276
Yeah.

142
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,527
Big time.

143
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:17,739
There she is.

144
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,410
Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

145
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:24,496
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

146
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,748
Oh, I can't do that.

147
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,001
I'm just another
asshole customer.

148
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,628
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

149
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,755
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

150
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,509
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

151
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,927
Why not?

152
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,015
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

153
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:44,434
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

154
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,895
I know. Anne wants me to go.

155
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:48,271
She thinks it might help.

156
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,940
Um...

157
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,401
You know,
sometimes I think that...

158
00:09:53,484 --> 00:09:55,988
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

159
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:57,489
Yeah. I know what you mean.

160
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,074
Yeah.

161
00:10:00,284 --> 00:10:01,452
What is that supposed to mean?

162
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:03,954
Nothing.

163
00:10:04,997 --> 00:10:07,166
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

164
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:08,334
and you wanna play poker
with us?

165
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,002
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

166
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:14,423
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

167
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:16,091
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

168
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,344
Peter, she's anorexic.

169
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:20,179
Yeah, I know.

170
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:21,597
The guy's really good.

171
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:25,267
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

172
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,020
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

173
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,855
Hey, and speaking of problems...

174
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:30,398
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

175
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:31,691
with your T.P.S. reports?

176
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,152
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

177
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:38,365
Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

178
00:10:38,448 --> 00:10:40,075
Is that Smykowski?

179
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,077
- Samir!
- What's he doing?

180
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,828
Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

181
00:10:43,912 --> 00:10:45,664
I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

182
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:48,500
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

183
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,210
What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

184
00:10:50,293 --> 00:10:52,837
So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

185
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,548
They're gonna downsize Initech.

186
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,841
What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

187
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:59,178
How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

188
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,346
That's how I know.

189
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,139
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

190
00:11:02,223 --> 00:11:04,016
It happened
at Initrode last year.

191
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,852
You have to interview
with this consultant.

192
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,687
They call them
efficiency experts...

193
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,896
but what you're really doing...

194
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,356
is interviewing
for your own job.

195
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:11,732
Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

196
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:12,984
and you're still here.

197
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,444
Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

198
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,655
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

199
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:19,782
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

200
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,242
Shit.

201
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,245
You know there are people
in this world...

202
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:26,747
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

203
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:29,001
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

204
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:32,254
You see,
that's what you have to do.

205
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:35,173
You have to use your mind...

206
00:11:35,257 --> 00:11:37,342
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

207
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:39,720
and you can make millions...
never have to work again.

208
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,930
You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

209
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,849
Sure it was.

210
00:11:43,932 --> 00:11:46,059
The guy made a million dollars.

211
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:51,398
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

212
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:52,941
a long time ago.

213
00:11:54,109 --> 00:11:55,569
Really? What was it, Tom?

214
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,155
Well, all right.

215
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:02,243
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

216
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:06,122
You see, it would be this mat...

217
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,374
that you would
put on the floor...

218
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,670
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

219
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:15,048
that you could jump to.

220
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:22,347
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

221
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,142
Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

222
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:30,189
Uh, look...

223
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:31,607
I gotta get outta here.

224
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,442
I'll see you guys later...

225
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:35,444
if I still have a job.

226
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:37,363
Yeah.

227
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,240
Our high school
guidance counsellor...

228
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:41,659
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

229
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:42,826
didn't have to work...

230
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,121
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

231
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:47,665
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

232
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:49,500
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

233
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,668
So what did you say?

234
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,628
I never had an answer.

235
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:55,339
I guess that's why
I'm working at Initech.

236
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:56,882
No. You're working at Initech...

237
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:59,051
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

238
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,761
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

239
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:03,181
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

240
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,642
You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

241
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:08,854
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

242
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:11,356
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

243
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:12,524
who works in securities...

244
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,734
Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

245
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:16,403
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

246
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,947
what you would want to do if...

247
00:13:20,073 --> 00:13:22,951
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

248
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:47,894
Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

249
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,187
Check out this chick!

250
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,689
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

251
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,733
like we can't hear
each other through the wall?

252
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,068
Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

253
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,320
No, but...

254
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,865
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

255
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,289
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

256
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,127
ANNOUNCER:
The key is early detection.

257
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,295
Tumours that are detected...

258
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:15,339
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

259
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,174
Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

260
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,676
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

261
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,345
Yeah.

262
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,638
A little bit. I...

263
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:24,514
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

264
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:25,974
You two still goin' out?

265
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:27,684
Yeah.

266
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,269
I guess. I... I don't know.

267
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:31,647
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

268
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,900
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

269
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,819
What do you mean by that?

270
00:14:36,903 --> 00:14:38,446
I don't know, man.

271
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:41,491
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

272
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:43,910
she's the type of chick
that just...

273
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:46,079
Uhh.

274
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,167
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, I... I...

275
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:53,294
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

276
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:54,712
Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

277
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:56,506
Just... I had a rough day.

278
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:58,216
Tell me about it, man.

279
00:15:00,843 --> 00:15:02,595
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

280
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,683
at six a.m.
Every day this week...

281
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:07,893
drag up to Las Golindas.

282
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:10,771
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

283
00:15:11,397 --> 00:15:12,565
Let me ask you something.

284
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:16,151
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

285
00:15:16,235 --> 00:15:17,361
does anyone ever say to you...

286
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,947
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

287
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:22,741
No.

288
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:24,994
No, man.

289
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,663
Shit, no, man.

290
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:30,332
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

291
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:32,001
Huh.

292
00:15:32,084 --> 00:15:33,502
We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

293
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,672
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

294
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:36,840
I just know it.

295
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,341
Well, you can
get out of that easily.

296
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,468
Yeah? How?

297
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:41,720
Well...

298
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,180
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

299
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:47,225
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

300
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:48,393
Yeah.

301
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:50,478
So all you gotta do is
avoid him... that's all right...

302
00:15:50,562 --> 00:15:52,772
I got it... on the last few hours
on Friday...

303
00:15:52,856 --> 00:15:54,691
duck out early...

304
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,359
turn off
your answering machine...

305
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,111
you should be home free, man.

306
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:02,240
That's a really good idea.

307
00:16:03,116 --> 00:16:04,284
Fuckin' "A," man.

308
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:09,874
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

309
00:16:09,957 --> 00:16:11,876
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

310
00:16:13,044 --> 00:16:15,213
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

311
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:21,135
That's it?

312
00:16:21,219 --> 00:16:22,386
If you had a million dollars...

313
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,513
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

314
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:27,350
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

315
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:30,186
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

316
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,021
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

317
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,481
Well, not all chicks.

318
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:36,317
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

319
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,528
Good point.

320
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,530
What about you, now?
What would you do?

321
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:40,989
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

322
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,241
Well, yeah.

323
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:43,867
Nothing.

324
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:45,953
Nothin', huh?

325
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:48,205
I would relax.

326
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,457
I would sit on my ass all day.

327
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,710
I would do nothing.

328
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:56,380
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

329
00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:57,923
Take a look at my cousin.

330
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:00,092
He's broke, don't do shit.

331
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,889
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

332
00:17:05,973 --> 00:17:07,391
Just a moment.

333
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:09,894
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

334
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:11,854
Just a moment.

335
00:17:11,938 --> 00:17:14,190
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

336
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:15,859
Just a moment.

337
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,528
So, you should ask yourself...

338
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:21,155
with every decision you make...

339
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,366
"Is this good for the company?

340
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:25,076
"Am I helping with..."

341
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,661
Is that the guy?

342
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:28,872
Yeah. We're screwed.

343
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,583
OK, then, um...

344
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,086
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

345
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,505
a new member to our team here.

346
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,924
This is, uh...

347
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,510
Bob Slydell.

348
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:45,055
Yeah. Uh...

349
00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:47,558
Bob is a consultant.

350
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,228
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

351
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,856
helping us out...

352
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,357
a little here...

353
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,859
asking some questions...

354
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:58,402
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

355
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:01,197
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

356
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,448
around here.

357
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,284
Yeah.

358
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:07,661
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

359
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:10,081
is Hawaiian shirt day.

360
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:15,670
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh...

361
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,339
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

362
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:21,218
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

363
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,510
Because I told Bill...

364
00:18:22,594 --> 00:18:25,013
that if they move my desk
one more time...

365
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,849
then I'm... I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

366
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,392
and I told Dom, too...

367
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,687
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

368
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:34,940
and I used to be over
by the window...

369
00:18:35,023 --> 00:18:38,235
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

370
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,530
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

371
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:43,032
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

372
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,034
because it didn't
bind up as much...

373
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,662
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

374
00:18:47,745 --> 00:18:48,829
OK, Milton.

375
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:50,998
No, it's not OK,
because if they make me...

376
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:54,502
If they take my stapler,
then I'll... I'll... I'll...

377
00:18:54,585 --> 00:18:56,837
I'll set the building on fire.

378
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:59,173
OK, well, that sounds great.

379
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:01,008
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

380
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,260
Peter...

381
00:19:18,235 --> 00:19:19,444
Good-bye.

382
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:43,261
Come on.

383
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,390
Oh, for cryin'...

384
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:11,623
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

385
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,334
Um...

386
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,336
I'm gonna need you...

387
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,254
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

388
00:20:17,338 --> 00:20:21,467
so if you could be here
around...

389
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,011
nine, that would be great.

390
00:20:24,094 --> 00:20:25,304
OK?

391
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:29,016
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

392
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:30,851
Um...

393
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:33,687
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

394
00:20:33,771 --> 00:20:36,315
on Sunday, too, OK?

395
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:38,025
We, um...

396
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:39,860
lost some people this week...

397
00:20:39,944 --> 00:20:42,029
and, uh...

398
00:20:42,112 --> 00:20:44,115
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

399
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,450
Thanks.

400
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:50,997
So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

401
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:55,085
and I realised, ever since
I started working, um...

402
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:58,838
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

403
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:00,632
the day before it.

404
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:05,303
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

405
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,139
that's on the worst day
of my life.

406
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,350
What about today?

407
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:11,685
Is today
the worst day of your life?

408
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:14,396
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's messed up.

409
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,776
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:20,069
Go on.

411
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:23,698
Is there any way
that you could sort of...

412
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,534
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

413
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:29,036
that I'm at work... in here?

414
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,538
Could I come home...

415
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:34,041
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

416
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,836
That's... really not what I do,
Peter.

417
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,170
Heh.

418
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:39,422
However...

419
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,967
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

420
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:46,096
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

421
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,975
I want you to try and relax.

422
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,523
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

423
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,944
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

424
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,866
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

425
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,870
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

426
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,207
as you slip deeper and deeper...

427
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,543
into a state
of complete relaxation.

428
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,798
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

429
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,383
Deeper and deeper.

430
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,385
Way down.

431
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,679
Your concern about your job...

432
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,682
melts away...

433
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,684
way...

434
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,186
way down.

435
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,604
Unh.

436
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,108
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

437
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,570
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

438
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,615
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

439
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,327
and you will remain
in that state...

440
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:51,830
until I snap my fingers.

441
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,374
Three.

442
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,125
Deeper and deeper.

443
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,835
Way...

444
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,379
way down.

445
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,464
Two.

446
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,550
Deeper and deeper...

447
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:05,469
W-w-w-way down...

448
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:09,890
Whu... whu...

449
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,183
One.

450
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:15,104
Oh, my God!
Dr. Swanson!

451
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,856
Ew... ew...

452
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,192
- Is he breathing?
- Call 911!

453
00:23:19,276 --> 00:23:23,029
Oh! Where's the phone?
Where's the goddamn phone?!

454
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:50,600
Ahh...

455
00:23:58,107 --> 00:24:00,234
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh.

456
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:01,527
It's about...

457
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,362
ten o'clock.

458
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:04,864
Yeah. Just, uh...

459
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:06,324
wondering where you are.

460
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:12,038
Yeah. Hi.
It's Bill Lumbergh again.

461
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:13,039
Uh...

462
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:14,707
I just wanted
to make sure you knew...

463
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,251
that we did start
at the, uh...

464
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,712
usual time this morning.

465
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:23,008
Yeah. It isn't a half day
or anything like that...

466
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:25,052
so if you could just go ahead...

467
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:27,137
and get here
as soon as possible...

468
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:29,097
that would be terrific.

469
00:24:35,562 --> 00:24:36,730
Ahh...

470
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:50,827
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lum...

471
00:24:50,911 --> 00:24:54,165
Yeah. It's...
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumber...

472
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:56,042
Yeah. It's me again.

473
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:58,962
Uh, I was away from my desk
for a minute.

474
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:02,215
Just checking in.

475
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,509
Hello?

476
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:06,261
Peter, what's going on?

477
00:25:07,595 --> 00:25:10,014
It's three-thirty.
Why aren't you at work?

478
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:13,017
Because I... I...

479
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,519
I didn't feel like it.

480
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,688
Peter, what's gotten into you?

481
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:18,773
First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

482
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:21,693
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

483
00:25:21,776 --> 00:25:23,445
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

484
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:25,322
That's total bull...

485
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,497
Listen, asshole.
Nobody hangs up on me.

486
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:35,040
We're through.

487
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:37,042
Oh, and one more thing...

488
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,211
I've been cheating on you!

489
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:47,094
So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

490
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:51,682
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day...

491
00:25:51,765 --> 00:25:54,728
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

492
00:25:54,811 --> 00:25:56,104
Otherwise,
use the old time sheets...

493
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,689
Where's Peter?

494
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,190
I heard he didn't show up
this weekend.

495
00:25:59,274 --> 00:26:00,358
Uh, I don't know.

496
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,943
...really, really help us out.

497
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,528
Who's that guy?

498
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:07,282
So, uh... any questions?

499
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:22,339
Hi. I'm Peter.

500
00:26:22,422 --> 00:26:23,506
Hi. Can I help you?

501
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:24,717
What are you doin'
for lunch today?

502
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,346
Uh, well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

503
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:30,723
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

504
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,186
Hey, look who's back!

505
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:36,979
Table for three to...

506
00:26:39,815 --> 00:26:41,734
I was askin'
what you were doin' for lunch.

507
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:43,444
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

508
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:46,239
Are you... are you serious?

509
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:47,490
Yeah.

510
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:51,786
Yeah. I... I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

511
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,790
Oh. OK, well,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

512
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:56,291
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table...

513
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,043
and if you'd like
to join me, uh...

514
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,378
no big deal, all right?

515
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:01,338
And if not, that's cool, too.

516
00:27:01,421 --> 00:27:02,631
- OK?
- OK.

517
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:03,840
All right.

518
00:27:04,841 --> 00:27:05,926
When you say,
"next door..."

519
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:08,512
do you mean
Chili's or Flinger's?

520
00:27:08,595 --> 00:27:10,222
Flinger's.

521
00:27:10,305 --> 00:27:11,473
OK.

522
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:14,977
What you do at Initech...

523
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,854
is you take the specifications
from the customers...

524
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,357
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

525
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,693
Yes. Y-yes.
That's... that's right.

526
00:27:22,776 --> 00:27:24,403
Well, then I just have to ask...

527
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:25,697
why couldn't the customers...

528
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,325
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

529
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,452
Well, I'll tell you why.

530
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:34,372
Uh, because...

531
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:37,709
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

532
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:39,460
Uh-huh. So...

533
00:27:40,461 --> 00:27:45,133
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

534
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:47,302
Well...

535
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,848
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

536
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,641
Huh.

537
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:55,435
So then you must
physically bring them...

538
00:27:55,518 --> 00:27:56,562
to the software people.

539
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:57,771
Well...

540
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:00,232
no.

541
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:01,567
I mean...

542
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,193
sometimes.

543
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:07,531
What... what would you
say you do here?

544
00:28:08,616 --> 00:28:10,701
Well, look,
I already told you.

545
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:13,037
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

546
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,914
so the engineers don't have to.

547
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:17,041
I have people skills.

548
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:19,084
I am good at dealing
with people!

549
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,544
Can't you understand that?!

550
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:23,047
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!

551
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,340
I...

552
00:28:30,972 --> 00:28:32,057
Let's see...

553
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,351
you are...

554
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:35,727
Michael...

555
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:39,856
- Bolton?
- Yeah.

556
00:28:41,274 --> 00:28:42,442
Is that your real name?

557
00:28:43,193 --> 00:28:44,361
Yeah.

558
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:48,448
Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

559
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:50,533
No, it's... it's
just a coincidence.

560
00:28:50,617 --> 00:28:52,160
Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

561
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:53,870
I love his music. I do.

562
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:56,081
- I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
- Me, too.

563
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:57,832
For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

564
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,378
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman."

565
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:02,380
But you must really
love his music, huh?

566
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:06,592
Yeah, he's... he's...

567
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:08,344
he's pretty...
he's pretty good, I guess.

568
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:10,012
You're goddamn right, he is.

569
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,557
Right.

570
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,101
So tell me, what's
your favourite song of his?

571
00:29:20,189 --> 00:29:22,191
I don't... I don't know.

572
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:24,610
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

573
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:27,822
That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

574
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:29,157
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

575
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:30,659
being you have
the same name as him.

576
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:33,620
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalogue.

577
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:36,206
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

578
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,458
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

579
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,007
Hi.

580
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,383
Hey.

581
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:51,179
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

582
00:29:52,014 --> 00:29:53,348
I think it would be OK.

583
00:29:55,017 --> 00:29:56,101
Would you like to sit down?

584
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:57,436
OK.

585
00:29:58,604 --> 00:29:59,772
Ahh.

586
00:30:01,274 --> 00:30:02,358
Wow!

587
00:30:02,442 --> 00:30:05,194
This place is really... nice.

588
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,572
Yeah. Is it?

589
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:09,866
Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

590
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:12,285
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

591
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,203
I like yours.

592
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,293
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

593
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:22,420
Yeah.

594
00:30:22,503 --> 00:30:24,881
Really.

595
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:26,382
It's on your...

596
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,886
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

597
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,847
That's, uh...

598
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,892
That's one of my...
my pieces of flair.

599
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,060
What's a "piece of flair"?

600
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:38,145
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

601
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:41,774
like these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

602
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:43,901
We're actually required
to wear...

603
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:46,946
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

604
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,198
It's really stupid, actually.

605
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,491
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

606
00:30:50,574 --> 00:30:52,034
Yeah, yeah, we do.

607
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,244
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

608
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:57,623
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

609
00:30:57,706 --> 00:31:00,459
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

610
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,754
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

611
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:04,214
OK.

612
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:07,300
So, where do you, work, Peter?

613
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:08,885
Initech.

614
00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,762
And... Yeah?
What... what do you do there?

615
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,515
I sit in a cubicle...

616
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:16,601
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

617
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,145
What's that?

618
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:21,356
Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

619
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,358
and, uh, to save space...

620
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,193
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

621
00:31:25,277 --> 00:31:28,196
So like 98 instead of 1998.

622
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,491
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

623
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:34,370
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

624
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:37,331
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

625
00:31:37,415 --> 00:31:39,709
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

626
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,211
You're just not gonna go?

627
00:31:42,295 --> 00:31:43,462
Yeah.

628
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:44,714
Won't you get fired?

629
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:46,841
I don't know.

630
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:50,720
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

631
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:52,889
So you're gonna quit?

632
00:31:52,972 --> 00:31:56,142
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

633
00:31:56,225 --> 00:31:57,810
I'm just gonna stop going.

634
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:01,188
What?

635
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:03,358
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

636
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:04,526
About an hour ago.

637
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,028
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

638
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:07,279
An hour ago.

639
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:10,157
So you're gonna get another job?

640
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,367
I don't think I'd like
another job.

641
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:16,288
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and...

642
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,874
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

643
00:32:18,957 --> 00:32:20,459
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

644
00:32:22,502 --> 00:32:23,629
Ahh...

645
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:25,797
well, so what do you want to do?

646
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:27,841
I want to take you
out to dinner...

647
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,219
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu."

648
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:31,637
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

649
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:35,433
I love "Kung Fu."

650
00:32:35,516 --> 00:32:37,769
- Channel 39.
- Totally.

651
00:32:37,852 --> 00:32:39,604
You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

652
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,648
- OK.
- Great.

653
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,858
OK. Can we order lunch first?

654
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:45,485
- Yeah.
- OK.

655
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,253
Took a stapler off my desk...

656
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:12,555
Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

657
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:17,685
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

658
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:19,353
Nothing.

659
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:21,355
I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

660
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:23,691
and move your desk
again, so...

661
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:26,527
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

662
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,445
against that wall as possible...

663
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:29,780
that would be great.

664
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,365
No, because I was...

665
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:32,908
That way,
we'll have some room...

666
00:33:32,992 --> 00:33:34,785
for some of these boxes
and things...

667
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:37,998
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

668
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,501
Oh. Oh, there it is.

669
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:44,254
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

670
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:47,716
Great.

671
00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:52,137
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

672
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,931
that would be terrific, OK?

673
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:57,684
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

674
00:33:57,767 --> 00:34:00,103
OK.

675
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:03,481
I could set the building
on fire.

676
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,779
- Peter.
- Michael.

677
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:09,947
What the hell's going on, man?

678
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,866
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

679
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,993
No. I just came to get
my address book.

680
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:15,202
I'm not gonna stay.

681
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:17,580
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

682
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:19,373
What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

683
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,459
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

684
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:25,171
Michael, I did nothing.

685
00:34:25,254 --> 00:34:26,714
I did absolutely nothing...

686
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:29,717
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

687
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,386
I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

688
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,056
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

689
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,265
The who?

690
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,644
The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

691
00:34:40,604 --> 00:34:43,899
Oh, yeah... right.

692
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,653
Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

693
00:34:47,736 --> 00:34:48,820
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

694
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:51,031
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

695
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:52,950
It's the best day of my life.

696
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:57,537
Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

697
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,124
Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

698
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,834
You must be Peter Gibbons.

699
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:04,253
Uh-huh. Terrific.

700
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,713
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

701
00:35:06,797 --> 00:35:08,215
Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

702
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:10,843
Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

703
00:35:12,387 --> 00:35:14,097
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

704
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,100
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

705
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:19,060
for how people spend their day
at work.

706
00:35:19,143 --> 00:35:20,770
So if you would...

707
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:24,440
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

708
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:27,860
- Yeah.
- Great.

709
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:31,406
Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

710
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:33,908
Uh, I use the side door.

711
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:36,953
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

712
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:40,958
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

713
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,544
Uh, "space out"?

714
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:44,712
Yeah.

715
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:46,630
I just stare at my desk.

716
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:48,173
But it looks like I'm working.

717
00:35:48,257 --> 00:35:52,052
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

718
00:35:52,136 --> 00:35:53,929
I'd say in a given week...

719
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:55,848
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

720
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:58,809
of real, actual work.

721
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:03,522
Peter,
would you be a good sport...

722
00:36:03,606 --> 00:36:05,566
and indulge us and just...

723
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:06,692
tell us a little more?

724
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:08,235
Oh, yeah.

725
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:11,990
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

726
00:36:12,073 --> 00:36:13,199
Ahh...

727
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:16,661
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

728
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,705
It's that I just don't care.

729
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:20,957
Don't... don't care?

730
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:23,543
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

731
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:25,211
Now, if I work my ass off...

732
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:27,172
and Initech
ships a few extra units...

733
00:36:27,255 --> 00:36:29,049
I don't see another dime.

734
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:30,759
So where's the motivation?

735
00:36:31,509 --> 00:36:33,386
And here's something else,
Bob...

736
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,388
I have eight different bosses
right now.

737
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:36,556
- I beg your pardon?
- Eight bosses.

738
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,724
- Eight?
- Eight, Bob.

739
00:36:37,807 --> 00:36:40,560
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

740
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:44,190
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

741
00:36:44,273 --> 00:36:47,568
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

742
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,861
That and the fear
of losing my job.

743
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,780
But you know, Bob...

744
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,531
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

745
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:53,783
not to get fired.

746
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,370
Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

747
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:58,788
OK.

748
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,791
What if...
and believe me...

749
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:04,835
this is strictly hypothetical...

750
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:08,923
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

751
00:37:09,006 --> 00:37:10,716
equity-sharing program?

752
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,052
Would that do anything for you?

753
00:37:12,135 --> 00:37:14,346
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

754
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:17,391
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

755
00:37:17,474 --> 00:37:18,725
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

756
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:21,395
Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

757
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:23,021
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

758
00:37:23,105 --> 00:37:24,856
I hope your firings
go really well.

759
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,066
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

760
00:37:26,149 --> 00:37:27,901
Great. Wow.

761
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:37,869
So, Peter, what's happening?

762
00:37:37,953 --> 00:37:39,329
Listen, uh...

763
00:37:46,713 --> 00:37:49,048
Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

764
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,009
Yeah.

765
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:55,263
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and I, uh...

766
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,973
We need to talk about
your flair.

767
00:37:57,849 --> 00:38:00,727
Really?
I... I have fifteen pieces on.

768
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,270
I also...

769
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:05,481
Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

770
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:06,649
Oh. OK.

771
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:08,651
Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

772
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:11,571
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

773
00:38:11,654 --> 00:38:12,864
Well, like Brian, for example...

774
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:16,327
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

775
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,703
And a terrific smile.

776
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:20,122
OK, so you want me to wear more?

777
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:22,833
Look, Joanna...

778
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,001
Yeah?

779
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,920
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

780
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:29,131
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

781
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,216
OK? That's what
the flair's about.

782
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,968
- It's about fun.
- Yeah.

783
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:35,221
OK, so more then, yeah?

784
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:40,184
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

785
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:44,689
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

786
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:47,525
but some people choose
to wear more...

787
00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:49,486
and we encourage that, OK?

788
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,822
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

789
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:55,033
Y- yeah.

790
00:38:55,116 --> 00:38:57,535
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

791
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,246
OK.

792
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:03,083
Right, so there's
three more people...

793
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,168
we can easily lose.

794
00:39:05,252 --> 00:39:08,463
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

795
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:10,465
He's useless.

796
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,092
Gone.

797
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:13,760
Sounds good to me.

798
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:16,222
Here's a peculiar...

799
00:39:16,305 --> 00:39:18,558
- Uh, Milton Waddams.
- Who's he?

800
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,643
You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

801
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,811
Oh, yeah.

802
00:39:21,894 --> 00:39:23,563
We... we can't actually
find a record...

803
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:25,898
of him being
a current employee here.

804
00:39:25,982 --> 00:39:27,775
I looked into it
more deeply...

805
00:39:27,858 --> 00:39:29,777
and I found that
apparently what happened...

806
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,572
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

807
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:33,823
and no one ever
told him about it...

808
00:39:33,906 --> 00:39:36,367
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

809
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,743
he still gets a paycheque.

810
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:40,663
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

811
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:41,831
Great.

812
00:39:41,914 --> 00:39:44,584
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

813
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:45,751
Just a second there,
professor.

814
00:39:45,835 --> 00:39:49,381
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

815
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:51,592
So he won't be receiving
a paycheque anymore.

816
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:54,136
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

817
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:57,264
We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

818
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:58,432
The problem is solved
from your end.

819
00:39:59,683 --> 00:40:03,145
I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

820
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:05,772
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

821
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:08,442
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

822
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:10,193
with upper management
written all over him.

823
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:12,654
Eech. Ooh.

824
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:16,033
Yeah. Um...

825
00:40:16,116 --> 00:40:17,368
I'm going to have to go ahead...

826
00:40:17,452 --> 00:40:19,579
and sort of disagree
with you there.

827
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:22,206
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

828
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,044
and I'm just not sure
that he's the calibre person...

829
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,379
that we would want
for upper management.

830
00:40:28,463 --> 00:40:31,132
He's also been having
some problems...

831
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,134
with his T.P.S. reports.

832
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:36,095
I'll handle this.

833
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,223
We feel...

834
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:41,392
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

835
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:45,396
It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

836
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,564
to get him really motivated.

837
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:47,815
There it is.

838
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:51,695
Yeah... Ah, well...

839
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:54,031
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

840
00:40:54,114 --> 00:40:56,825
Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

841
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:00,204
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

842
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:02,289
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

843
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:08,671
Yeah...

844
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:17,325
Hey, Peter, man!

845
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:20,954
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams. Whoo!

846
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:38,055
Hi, Peter.

847
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,890
Oh, hi, Dom.

848
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,192
So... Peter...

849
00:43:30,276 --> 00:43:31,360
what's happening?

850
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:34,738
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

851
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:38,659
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

852
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,119
No.

853
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,872
Ahh... yeah...

854
00:43:43,956 --> 00:43:45,833
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

855
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:48,794
and have a little talk, hmm?

856
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:51,880
Not right now, Lumbergh,
I'm... I'm kinda busy.

857
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:55,802
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

858
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:57,887
Just come back another time.

859
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,390
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

860
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:03,602
Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

861
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:05,895
Yeah, they called me at home.

862
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:11,776
That sounds good, Peter.

863
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,029
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

864
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,406
get this all fixed up for you.

865
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:17,532
Great.

866
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:25,249
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

867
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,878
I... I didn't receive
my paycheque this week.

868
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:33,549
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

869
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:34,884
I did and they said...

870
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:36,761
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

871
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:40,556
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

872
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,350
No, I... I...

873
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:46,395
New people are coming,
and we need the space.

874
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:47,730
But there's no space...

875
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:51,400
So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

876
00:44:51,484 --> 00:44:53,152
and move it down there...

877
00:44:53,236 --> 00:44:55,239
that would be terrific.

878
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:56,615
OK?

879
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:58,700
Uh, excuse me...

880
00:44:58,784 --> 00:45:04,373
I believe you have my stapler,
please.

881
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:06,750
You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

882
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:09,002
I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

883
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,672
Good one.

884
00:45:11,755 --> 00:45:13,548
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

885
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:16,760
I'm sure you've... you've heard
some of the rumours...

886
00:45:16,843 --> 00:45:18,553
circulating
around the hallways...

887
00:45:18,637 --> 00:45:21,390
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning..."

888
00:45:21,473 --> 00:45:22,724
with some software people.

889
00:45:22,808 --> 00:45:25,979
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

890
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:28,064
We'll be getting rid
of these people.

891
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:32,944
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

892
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:34,195
Naga...

893
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:37,490
Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

894
00:45:37,574 --> 00:45:40,952
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

895
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:42,704
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

896
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:45,290
Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

897
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:47,542
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

898
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:48,876
It's standard
operating procedure.

899
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,129
Do they know this yet?

900
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:53,381
No. No, of course not.

901
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:56,259
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

902
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,554
Studies have
statistically shown...

903
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:00,306
there's less chance
of an incident...

904
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:02,057
if you do it at the end
of the week.

905
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:05,227
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

906
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,981
to have as many
as four people...

907
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:10,357
working right underneath you.

908
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:12,568
This is a big promotion, Pete.

909
00:46:12,651 --> 00:46:15,279
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

910
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:17,197
and give me more money?

911
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:26,165
Hmm. Yeah.

912
00:46:26,248 --> 00:46:29,044
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

913
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:30,378
Give it to me.

914
00:46:30,462 --> 00:46:31,922
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

915
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:33,548
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

916
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:36,176
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck...

917
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:38,053
- Michael.
- Hey.

918
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:39,512
Listen to me.

919
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:43,642
What are you doing tonight?

920
00:46:45,185 --> 00:46:48,063
Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

921
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:50,649
and maybe that time for you
is now...

922
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,403
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

923
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,572
Uh, no offence there, Peter...

924
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:59,408
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

925
00:46:59,492 --> 00:47:02,662
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

926
00:47:02,745 --> 00:47:06,749
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

927
00:47:06,832 --> 00:47:09,585
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

928
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:13,089
Yeah, and, uh, and I... Listen...

929
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,883
That virus
you're always talking about...

930
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,094
the one that could
rip off the company...

931
00:47:18,177 --> 00:47:19,595
for a bunch of money.

932
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:20,930
Yeah, what about it?

933
00:47:21,013 --> 00:47:22,682
Well, how does it work?

934
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:24,850
It's pretty brilliant.

935
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:27,061
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

936
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,564
where interest is computed...
there are thousands a day...

937
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:31,608
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

938
00:47:31,692 --> 00:47:33,193
which it usually rounds off.

939
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:35,612
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

940
00:47:35,696 --> 00:47:37,614
and puts it into an account.

941
00:47:37,698 --> 00:47:40,409
- This sounds familiar.
- They did it in "Superman III."

942
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:41,618
Right, uh...

943
00:47:41,702 --> 00:47:43,412
An underrated movie, actually.

944
00:47:43,495 --> 00:47:46,790
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

945
00:47:46,873 --> 00:47:49,876
- So they check for this now.
- No, here's the thing.

946
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,213
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

947
00:47:53,297 --> 00:47:54,423
they'd never notice.

948
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:56,508
You're right.

949
00:47:56,592 --> 00:47:58,927
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

950
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:02,015
Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

951
00:48:02,098 --> 00:48:06,019
So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

952
00:48:06,102 --> 00:48:08,646
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

953
00:48:09,856 --> 00:48:12,317
What if you didn't have
a good job?

954
00:48:13,776 --> 00:48:14,986
Cock gobblers!

955
00:48:18,656 --> 00:48:22,410
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

956
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:24,662
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

957
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:26,539
Actually, I'm being promoted.

958
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,250
- What?!
- I know, Michael.

959
00:48:29,334 --> 00:48:31,837
It's completely unfair.

960
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:34,381
And I realised something today.

961
00:48:34,465 --> 00:48:37,384
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

962
00:48:37,468 --> 00:48:39,470
It's about all of us together.

963
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:44,475
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

964
00:48:44,558 --> 00:48:47,061
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

965
00:48:47,144 --> 00:48:49,813
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

966
00:48:49,897 --> 00:48:52,858
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

967
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:55,861
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

968
00:48:55,945 --> 00:48:59,240
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

969
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:01,242
staring at computer screens
all day...

970
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,410
filling out useless forms...

971
00:49:02,494 --> 00:49:04,120
and listening
to eight different bosses...

972
00:49:04,204 --> 00:49:06,623
drone on
about mission statements.

973
00:49:06,706 --> 00:49:09,584
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

974
00:49:09,668 --> 00:49:13,338
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

975
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:16,258
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

976
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:20,387
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

977
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,846
Five years...

978
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,724
of your mid-twenties now gone.

979
00:49:24,808 --> 00:49:26,059
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

980
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:28,728
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

981
00:49:28,812 --> 00:49:30,563
You know why?

982
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:35,069
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

983
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:36,737
Ugh.

984
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:38,906
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

985
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,950
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

986
00:49:41,033 --> 00:49:44,328
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

987
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:47,707
Your software works, right?

988
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:49,458
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

989
00:49:50,918 --> 00:49:53,004
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

990
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:55,590
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

991
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:58,634
Yeah. But Samir does.

992
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:00,928
But that's not much money.

993
00:50:01,012 --> 00:50:02,221
That's the beauty of it.

994
00:50:02,305 --> 00:50:06,351
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

995
00:50:06,435 --> 00:50:08,604
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

996
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:10,105
you space it out
over a couple of years...

997
00:50:10,188 --> 00:50:12,441
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

998
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:13,734
It's like "Superman III."

999
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:15,861
"Superman lll"?

1000
00:50:15,944 --> 00:50:19,615
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rיsumי ready.

1001
00:50:19,698 --> 00:50:23,869
For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1002
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:26,663
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1003
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:30,876
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1004
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:33,712
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1005
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:36,215
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1006
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,343
Come on. Sit down.

1007
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,512
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1008
00:50:41,596 --> 00:50:44,515
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1009
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:46,976
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1010
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,355
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1011
00:50:50,438 --> 00:50:54,108
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1012
00:50:54,192 --> 00:50:55,818
- Really?
- Yes.

1013
00:50:55,902 --> 00:50:57,195
Shit!

1014
00:50:57,278 --> 00:51:00,031
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1015
00:51:00,114 --> 00:51:01,866
So what do you think?

1016
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,452
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1017
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:05,746
Samir?

1018
00:51:07,456 --> 00:51:10,209
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1019
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:13,420
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1020
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,881
Tomorrow is your last day
at Initech.

1021
00:51:15,965 --> 00:51:17,466
You have two options...

1022
00:51:17,549 --> 00:51:19,927
unemployment
or early retirement.

1023
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,595
What's it gonna be?

1024
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:23,973
- I have a question.
- Yes?

1025
00:51:24,056 --> 00:51:27,768
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1026
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,562
Yep, you sure can.

1027
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,234
OK, I'll do it.

1028
00:51:35,317 --> 00:51:38,196
That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1029
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,656
Can we discuss the plan?

1030
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:41,408
OK, yeah, good, right.

1031
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:42,951
It works like a computer virus.

1032
00:51:43,034 --> 00:51:45,620
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1033
00:51:45,704 --> 00:51:46,871
It'll do the rest.

1034
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:49,291
Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1035
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:52,210
Before we go any further,
all right?

1036
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:54,796
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1037
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:57,382
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1038
00:51:57,465 --> 00:52:00,552
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1039
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:01,845
- Of course.
- Agreed.

1040
00:52:01,928 --> 00:52:04,097
Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1041
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:06,391
- What the fuck is that?
- Don't worry. He's cool.

1042
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:09,854
All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1043
00:52:09,937 --> 00:52:12,732
Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1044
00:52:12,815 --> 00:52:14,025
Thank you, Bob.

1045
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:16,402
We'll get some people
under you right away.

1046
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:43,367
That was easy.

1047
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,452
Yeah, I guess it was.

1048
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:47,121
What'd you do with the...

1049
00:53:47,288 --> 00:53:49,081
Hey, man.

1050
00:53:49,164 --> 00:53:50,833
Oh, hey, Drew.

1051
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,543
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1052
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:53,711
That he got laid off?

1053
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:55,296
No, man, check it out.

1054
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:57,923
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1055
00:53:58,007 --> 00:54:01,385
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1056
00:54:01,468 --> 00:54:02,595
Is he dead?

1057
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:04,221
No, man, check it out.

1058
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:07,433
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1059
00:54:07,516 --> 00:54:09,393
He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1060
00:54:09,476 --> 00:54:12,397
I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1061
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,773
It's jammed.

1062
00:54:13,857 --> 00:54:16,318
I... I couldn't get it
into drive.

1063
00:54:16,401 --> 00:54:19,070
- I... I... I mean, reverse.
- You OK, Tom?

1064
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:21,448
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1065
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:23,533
he decides he wants to live.

1066
00:54:23,617 --> 00:54:25,076
Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1067
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,536
Right.

1068
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,788
Seems to be working now.

1069
00:54:30,582 --> 00:54:32,292
See you later, honey.

1070
00:54:32,375 --> 00:54:33,627
Love ya.

1071
00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:39,090
But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway... Bam!

1072
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:41,802
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1073
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:43,846
- Is he OK?
- Sort of.

1074
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,058
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1075
00:54:47,141 --> 00:54:49,310
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1076
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:50,561
Like seven figures.

1077
00:54:50,645 --> 00:54:52,146
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1078
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:54,148
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1079
00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:56,233
We're all invited.

1080
00:54:56,317 --> 00:54:58,945
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1081
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:01,572
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1082
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:07,161
You know what I'm talking about.

1083
00:55:07,244 --> 00:55:09,372
Yeah. Right.

1084
00:55:09,455 --> 00:55:10,790
See you guys there.

1085
00:55:12,124 --> 00:55:15,337
Wow, our last day at Initech.

1086
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:18,632
I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1087
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,968
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1088
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,346
I stole something.

1089
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:26,431
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1090
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:29,184
No, I stole something else.

1091
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:31,687
What did you steal?

1092
00:55:33,272 --> 00:55:35,565
Call it a going-away present.

1093
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:14,251
Who's got my keys?

1094
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:15,710
I'm driving.

1095
00:57:15,794 --> 00:57:17,463
Everything is gonna be OK.

1096
00:57:17,546 --> 00:57:19,382
All right? OK?

1097
00:57:19,465 --> 00:57:21,050
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1098
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:23,678
I gotta... I gotta go. All right?

1099
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:24,929
Joanna's coming over.

1100
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:28,182
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1101
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:30,393
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1102
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:31,560
Everything will be OK.

1103
00:57:31,644 --> 00:57:33,771
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1104
00:57:33,854 --> 00:57:35,564
All right? Good night!

1105
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:38,317
Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1106
00:57:40,903 --> 00:57:43,030
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1107
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:47,828
Oh, um... l'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1108
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,666
I really can't.

1109
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:58,422
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1110
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,716
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1111
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,676
that just get rounded off.

1112
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:04,303
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1113
00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:07,639
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1114
00:58:07,723 --> 00:58:09,725
into an account that we opened.

1115
00:58:10,851 --> 00:58:12,269
So you're stealing?

1116
00:58:13,312 --> 00:58:15,147
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1117
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,985
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1118
00:58:19,068 --> 00:58:22,071
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1119
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:25,450
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1120
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:29,245
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1121
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:30,622
- Yeah.
- Right.

1122
00:58:30,705 --> 00:58:31,789
It's not yours?

1123
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:34,042
Uh... well, it becomes ours.

1124
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:35,960
How is that not stealing?

1125
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,841
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1126
00:58:41,925 --> 00:58:45,011
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1127
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:47,347
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1128
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:48,681
From the crippled children?

1129
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:49,892
No, that's the jar.

1130
00:58:49,975 --> 00:58:53,479
I'm talking about the tray...
the pennies for everybody.

1131
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:54,897
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1132
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,066
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1133
00:58:57,149 --> 00:59:01,070
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1134
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:02,905
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1135
00:59:02,988 --> 00:59:05,074
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1136
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:06,575
So what's wrong with that?

1137
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:08,285
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1138
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:09,536
It's not wrong.

1139
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,788
Initech is wrong.

1140
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:13,374
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1141
00:59:13,457 --> 00:59:15,542
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1142
00:59:15,626 --> 00:59:17,544
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1143
00:59:17,628 --> 00:59:19,630
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1144
00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:22,092
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1145
00:59:22,175 --> 00:59:23,843
taking money from the register.

1146
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,136
Well, maybe you should.

1147
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,225
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1148
00:59:30,308 --> 00:59:31,559
What?

1149
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,896
Look, we don't... l'm...

1150
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,606
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1151
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:40,193
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1152
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,949
Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1153
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:47,158
- Hey, Tom.
- Hello, Tom.

1154
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:50,287
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1155
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:53,082
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1156
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:56,627
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1157
00:59:56,711 --> 00:59:59,714
Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1158
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,632
- This is, uh, Joanna.
- Hi.

1159
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:04,135
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

1160
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:13,644
Ooh, ooh.

1161
01:00:13,728 --> 01:00:16,147
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1162
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:20,109
Well... what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1163
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:21,945
Huh... that's...

1164
01:00:22,029 --> 01:00:24,615
that's exactly as you
described it.

1165
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:29,119
Uh, listen, I heard about
your... your settlement.

1166
01:00:29,202 --> 01:00:30,370
Congratulations.

1167
01:00:30,454 --> 01:00:31,580
Well, thanks, Peter.

1168
01:00:31,663 --> 01:00:35,542
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1169
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:38,962
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1170
01:00:39,046 --> 01:00:41,715
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1171
01:00:41,798 --> 01:00:43,467
I used to be the same way.

1172
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,552
- Really?
- Sure.

1173
01:00:45,636 --> 01:00:47,262
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1174
01:00:47,346 --> 01:00:50,182
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1175
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:52,560
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1176
01:00:52,644 --> 01:00:53,937
Wow.

1177
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:57,565
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1178
01:00:57,649 --> 01:01:00,902
good things can happen
in this world.

1179
01:01:00,985 --> 01:01:03,071
I mean, look at me.

1180
01:01:04,072 --> 01:01:05,490
Thanks, Tom.

1181
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:08,409
Ah, sure.

1182
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:17,001
Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1183
01:01:17,085 --> 01:01:19,712
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1184
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:21,923
I have a client in there
right now.

1185
01:01:22,006 --> 01:01:23,634
He says the trick is...

1186
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:25,552
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1187
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:27,096
or become someone's bitch.

1188
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:29,765
Then everything
will be all right.

1189
01:01:29,848 --> 01:01:31,475
Why do you ask, anyway?

1190
01:01:31,558 --> 01:01:33,811
Oh, no, we just...

1191
01:01:33,894 --> 01:01:35,104
It's a...

1192
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,404
- Hey, Peter.
- Drew.

1193
01:01:43,487 --> 01:01:45,656
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1194
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:47,533
- Yeah.
- Lucky bastard.

1195
01:01:48,701 --> 01:01:51,870
Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1196
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:53,706
Yep.

1197
01:01:53,789 --> 01:01:55,375
Who's she here with?

1198
01:01:55,458 --> 01:01:56,751
She's with me.

1199
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:00,714
- Really?
- Yep.

1200
01:02:00,797 --> 01:02:04,259
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1201
01:02:05,302 --> 01:02:07,429
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1202
01:02:09,723 --> 01:02:10,849
Why's that, Drew?

1203
01:02:10,932 --> 01:02:12,559
Are you kidding me?

1204
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:14,728
She gets around. All right?

1205
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:18,231
She does, does she?

1206
01:02:18,315 --> 01:02:20,442
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1207
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,738
Like with who?

1208
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:27,742
Oh, let's see, uh...

1209
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:29,994
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1210
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,830
Uh, let me see, who else?

1211
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:36,083
Lumbergh?

1212
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:40,796
What if you get caught?

1213
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,091
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1214
01:02:44,175 --> 01:02:47,219
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1215
01:02:47,303 --> 01:02:48,638
What?

1216
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:49,931
What are you...

1217
01:02:51,098 --> 01:02:53,059
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1218
01:02:54,685 --> 01:02:57,814
Oh... God... Lumbergh!

1219
01:02:57,898 --> 01:02:59,900
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1220
01:02:59,983 --> 01:03:01,693
That was, like, two years ago.

1221
01:03:01,777 --> 01:03:03,153
What? Did you know him?

1222
01:03:03,236 --> 01:03:04,821
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1223
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:06,198
He's my boss.

1224
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:09,701
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1225
01:03:09,785 --> 01:03:11,828
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1226
01:03:11,912 --> 01:03:15,123
He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1227
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:16,917
and you slept with him.

1228
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,379
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1229
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:23,298
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1230
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,549
I don't care.

1231
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,719
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1232
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,972
Listen to you.

1233
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,515
Who do you think you are?

1234
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,101
How dare you judge me?

1235
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,979
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an בngel?

1236
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,773
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1237
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,526
wannabe criminal man.

1238
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,278
Yeah, well, that may be.

1239
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,822
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1240
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,198
OK, that's... l'm done.

1241
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,535
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1242
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,412
Call me when you grow up.

1243
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,664
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1244
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:55,873
So don't call me, OK?

1245
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,168
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1246
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,885
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1247
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,512
Lumbergh fucked her.

1248
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:10,764
Lumbergh fucked her.

1249
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,766
That is great.

1250
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,894
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1251
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,111
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1252
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,572
That's it. Great.

1253
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:28,783
Peter, what's happening?

1254
01:04:28,867 --> 01:04:33,747
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

1255
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,805
- Joanna.
- Yeah.

1256
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:53,183
We need to talk.

1257
01:04:53,266 --> 01:04:55,143
Do you know what this is about?

1258
01:04:59,064 --> 01:05:00,733
My, uh, flair?

1259
01:05:00,816 --> 01:05:02,902
Yeah.

1260
01:05:02,985 --> 01:05:06,781
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1261
01:05:06,864 --> 01:05:09,241
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1262
01:05:09,325 --> 01:05:11,619
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1263
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:15,831
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1264
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:20,086
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1265
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:24,382
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1266
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:26,759
like your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1267
01:05:26,842 --> 01:05:28,427
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1268
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:30,472
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1269
01:05:30,555 --> 01:05:33,141
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1270
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:35,435
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1271
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,479
Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1272
01:05:37,562 --> 01:05:40,023
I do want to express myself.

1273
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:42,943
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1274
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:47,072
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1275
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:51,451
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1276
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:53,245
There it is.

1277
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:54,871
I hate this job.

1278
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:57,624
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1279
01:06:13,433 --> 01:06:14,517
Oh, shit.

1280
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:16,185
- Shit.
- Shit.

1281
01:06:16,269 --> 01:06:18,771
- Shit.
- Son of a bitch.

1282
01:06:18,855 --> 01:06:21,566
- Shit.
- This is a fuck.

1283
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:22,734
I... I... Shit.

1284
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:24,235
What happened?

1285
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,487
You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1286
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:28,114
Yes, it's your software.

1287
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:30,366
Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1288
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:33,120
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred...

1289
01:06:33,203 --> 01:06:36,415
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1290
01:06:36,498 --> 01:06:37,833
Oh, shit.

1291
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:39,918
They probably
won't know it's gone...

1292
01:06:40,002 --> 01:06:41,712
for another three or four days.

1293
01:06:41,795 --> 01:06:45,341
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1294
01:06:45,424 --> 01:06:47,885
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1295
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:49,219
Technically, it did work.

1296
01:06:49,303 --> 01:06:50,596
No, it didn't!

1297
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:53,557
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1298
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:55,225
OK.

1299
01:06:55,309 --> 01:06:58,437
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1300
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,065
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1301
01:07:01,148 --> 01:07:05,195
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1302
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:06,780
Quit getting pissed at me.

1303
01:07:06,863 --> 01:07:08,782
This was all your idea, asshole.

1304
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:11,993
All right. OK.

1305
01:07:12,077 --> 01:07:14,579
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1306
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,165
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1307
01:07:17,248 --> 01:07:20,919
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1308
01:07:21,002 --> 01:07:25,173
WORKERS SINGING:
Happy birthday to you

1309
01:07:25,256 --> 01:07:30,220
Happy birthday to you

1310
01:07:30,303 --> 01:07:35,893
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

1311
01:07:35,977 --> 01:07:40,106
Happy birthday to you

1312
01:07:44,402 --> 01:07:45,736
Looks terrific.

1313
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,740
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1314
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:55,621
Oh, that is terrific.

1315
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:56,998
Just terrific.

1316
01:07:57,081 --> 01:08:00,876
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1317
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,253
It's very special.

1318
01:08:02,336 --> 01:08:04,548
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1319
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,884
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1320
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:11,054
But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told...

1321
01:08:11,138 --> 01:08:12,639
Just pass.

1322
01:08:12,723 --> 01:08:17,936
OK, here. But this...

1323
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:23,025
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1324
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:27,070
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1325
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:47,050
I could set
the building on fire.

1326
01:08:47,133 --> 01:08:51,220
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1327
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:54,098
Hand them a cheque for the exact
amount they're missing?

1328
01:08:54,182 --> 01:08:57,101
I... I think
they'd figure that out.

1329
01:08:57,185 --> 01:08:59,437
Well, we have to do something.

1330
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,522
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1331
01:09:02,857 --> 01:09:04,817
That's a great idea.

1332
01:09:04,901 --> 01:09:05,944
OK, how do we do that?

1333
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:07,738
I don't know.

1334
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:09,490
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1335
01:09:09,573 --> 01:09:11,283
I think coke dealers do it.

1336
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:13,953
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1337
01:09:14,828 --> 01:09:16,330
My cousin's a cokehead.

1338
01:09:21,835 --> 01:09:23,379
Fuck.

1339
01:09:23,462 --> 01:09:24,713
We're in deep shit.

1340
01:09:24,797 --> 01:09:28,467
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

1341
01:09:33,472 --> 01:09:35,391
- Milton.
- Yes.

1342
01:09:35,474 --> 01:09:36,642
What's happening?

1343
01:09:36,725 --> 01:09:39,229
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1344
01:09:39,312 --> 01:09:40,397
But... no.

1345
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,232
Since you're down here...

1346
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:45,527
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1347
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,363
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1348
01:09:48,446 --> 01:09:51,449
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheque...

1349
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:53,326
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1350
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:56,746
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1351
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,998
and crawl down...

1352
01:09:58,081 --> 01:10:00,500
Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1353
01:10:00,583 --> 01:10:02,419
We got a big problem... big.

1354
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:05,422
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

1355
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:11,804
'Scuse me.

1356
01:10:13,639 --> 01:10:14,807
'Scuse me.

1357
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:21,397
OK... but that's
the last straw.

1358
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,899
Here we go, here we go.

1359
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:28,237
Uh, launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash..."

1360
01:10:28,321 --> 01:10:31,532
"To conceal the source
of money...

1361
01:10:31,616 --> 01:10:34,869
"as by channelling it through
an intermediary."

1362
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:37,038
"To conceal..."

1363
01:10:37,121 --> 01:10:39,583
That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

1364
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:41,376
I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

1365
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,587
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

1366
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:48,175
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

1367
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:49,968
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

1368
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:51,219
That's what I can't believe.

1369
01:10:51,303 --> 01:10:54,264
- Yeah. You didn't know that?
- Yeah, you didn't know that?

1370
01:10:54,348 --> 01:10:56,391
A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1371
01:10:58,852 --> 01:11:02,731
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the Initrode guy? The young guy?

1372
01:11:02,814 --> 01:11:05,317
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

1373
01:11:07,361 --> 01:11:10,198
Her fucking... Her children
would have hooves.

1374
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:13,743
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

1375
01:11:15,203 --> 01:11:16,913
Who's that?

1376
01:11:17,914 --> 01:11:19,415
All right, nobody panic.

1377
01:11:19,499 --> 01:11:21,167
Probably just Lawrence.

1378
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,422
Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

1379
01:11:26,506 --> 01:11:28,007
I come from a rough area.

1380
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:29,676
I used to be addicted
to crack...

1381
01:11:29,759 --> 01:11:31,636
but now I'm off
and trying to stay clean.

1382
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:34,138
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

1383
01:11:34,222 --> 01:11:36,224
- No, no.
- Wait a minute.

1384
01:11:36,307 --> 01:11:38,267
You used to be
addicted to crack?

1385
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,063
Yeah. Um...

1386
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:44,817
Look, I'm very sorry.

1387
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,403
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

1388
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:49,905
We're not asking you
about money laundering.

1389
01:11:49,989 --> 01:11:51,365
All we need is for you
to hook us...

1390
01:11:51,448 --> 01:11:53,242
If he doesn't
know anybody...

1391
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:55,077
No. Wait a minute.

1392
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:58,080
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

1393
01:11:58,163 --> 01:12:00,582
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

1394
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:01,792
I lied.

1395
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,920
All that stuff I said
about being a crackhead...

1396
01:12:05,004 --> 01:12:07,423
just helps me sell magazines.

1397
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:10,009
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

1398
01:12:13,805 --> 01:12:16,891
- You're a software engineer?
- Yep.

1399
01:12:16,975 --> 01:12:19,519
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

1400
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:21,229
Actually, man...

1401
01:12:21,313 --> 01:12:23,315
I make more money selling
magazine subscriptions...

1402
01:12:23,398 --> 01:12:24,858
than I ever did at Initrode.

1403
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:27,068
Heh. At Initrode?

1404
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:29,112
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

1405
01:12:29,195 --> 01:12:30,530
about all this stuff
we told you.

1406
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,825
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1407
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:38,330
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1408
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:46,297
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1409
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:48,674
We never should have done this.

1410
01:12:48,758 --> 01:12:50,593
What were we thinking?

1411
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:52,595
You know what I can't
figure out?

1412
01:12:52,678 --> 01:12:55,848
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1413
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:57,308
can be so good at crime...

1414
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:59,894
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

1415
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:01,520
We're new to it, though.

1416
01:13:01,604 --> 01:13:04,106
If we had more experience...

1417
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:07,568
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1418
01:13:07,652 --> 01:13:09,111
I think
there's enough evidence...

1419
01:13:09,195 --> 01:13:11,238
all over that building
to link us to this.

1420
01:13:11,322 --> 01:13:13,408
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1421
01:13:13,492 --> 01:13:15,077
What we've done is bad enough.

1422
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:16,411
We get caught
laundering money...

1423
01:13:16,495 --> 01:13:18,455
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

1424
01:13:18,538 --> 01:13:21,458
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1425
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:23,585
I don't want to go
to any prison.

1426
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:25,921
Why the hell did I do this?

1427
01:13:26,004 --> 01:13:28,674
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1428
01:13:28,757 --> 01:13:29,967
We weren't thinking clearly...

1429
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:32,219
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1430
01:13:32,302 --> 01:13:34,596
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1431
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,890
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

1432
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,644
I'm going home.

1433
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:41,895
Me, too.

1434
01:13:43,563 --> 01:13:47,735
You are a very...
bad person, Peter.

1435
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:09,340
Lawrence, you awake?

1436
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:10,675
Yeah.

1437
01:14:12,427 --> 01:14:13,636
You wanna come over?

1438
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,804
No, thanks, man.

1439
01:14:14,887 --> 01:14:17,099
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

1440
01:14:22,646 --> 01:14:25,524
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes...

1441
01:14:25,607 --> 01:14:28,027
that you have committed
against Initech...

1442
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:31,113
I hereby sentence you,
Michael Bolton...

1443
01:14:31,196 --> 01:14:36,035
and Samir Naan... Nanadajibad...

1444
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:38,370
to a term of no less
than four years...

1445
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:42,041
in a federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1446
01:14:45,878 --> 01:14:47,672
Peter Gibbons...

1447
01:14:47,756 --> 01:14:50,508
you've led a trite
and meaningless life...

1448
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:55,180
and you're a very bad person.

1449
01:15:32,426 --> 01:15:33,594
Hey.

1450
01:15:35,012 --> 01:15:37,556
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

1451
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,809
No, no. I got fired.

1452
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:43,062
- What happened?
- I flipped off my boss.

1453
01:15:43,145 --> 01:15:45,231
Some customers...

1454
01:15:45,314 --> 01:15:47,066
Actually, a line cook...

1455
01:15:47,149 --> 01:15:49,152
but he just happened
to be standing there, so...

1456
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,531
I might be going away
for a while.

1457
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:56,034
Uh... to jail.

1458
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:58,036
You were right
about that computer scam.

1459
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,454
That was a bad idea.

1460
01:15:59,538 --> 01:16:02,124
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

1461
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,544
I'm on my way now
to return the money...

1462
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:08,005
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

1463
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:11,633
Joanna, I want to apologise.

1464
01:16:11,717 --> 01:16:14,219
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

1465
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:15,887
Lumbergh is not my problem.

1466
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,015
It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

1467
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:21,978
I don't know why I can't just...
go to work and be happy...

1468
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:24,480
like I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

1469
01:16:24,564 --> 01:16:26,733
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

1470
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:30,778
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

1471
01:16:30,862 --> 01:16:32,739
Yeah. Well...

1472
01:16:34,407 --> 01:16:36,451
I may never be happy
at my job...

1473
01:16:36,534 --> 01:16:39,412
but I think that if
I could be with you...

1474
01:16:39,495 --> 01:16:41,497
that I could be happy
with my life.

1475
01:16:41,581 --> 01:16:43,583
I've been a real asshole.

1476
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,753
But, if you'd give it
another shot, I promise...

1477
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,087
OK, shut up.

1478
01:16:52,509 --> 01:16:55,262
Hey, what's going on here?

1479
01:16:55,346 --> 01:16:57,848
Get a room, you two! Ha ha!

1480
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:03,395
I hate that guy.

1481
01:17:54,323 --> 01:17:56,409
Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll...

1482
01:17:56,492 --> 01:17:59,078
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

1483
01:17:59,161 --> 01:18:01,747
And I still haven't received
my paycheque.

1484
01:18:01,831 --> 01:18:04,500
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

1485
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,919
And then they moved my desk
to storage room "B."

1486
01:18:07,003 --> 01:18:08,838
And there was
garbage on it, and...

1487
01:18:08,921 --> 01:18:11,424
Why don't you go back down
and sit at your desk?

1488
01:18:11,507 --> 01:18:12,967
Mr. Lumbergh
should be here any minute.

1489
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:16,262
- Mr. Lumbergh...
- Just go sit at your desk.

1490
01:18:16,345 --> 01:18:18,806
OK. But, I... I'm gonna just...

1491
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:28,317
I have to take
my stapler back...

1492
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:32,112
because I told him
it's my stapler.

1493
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:38,827
It's my stapler.

1494
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,664
A Swingline, the brand
I've been using for a long time.

1495
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:03,186
Lawrence, you in there?

1496
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:07,065
Hey, Peter, man.

1497
01:19:07,148 --> 01:19:08,816
Hey.

1498
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,110
So, I might be going away
for a while.

1499
01:19:11,194 --> 01:19:13,112
Yeah, I know, man.

1500
01:19:13,196 --> 01:19:15,698
It's a bummer, dude.
What can I say?

1501
01:19:15,782 --> 01:19:17,825
Yeah. Yeah.

1502
01:19:19,494 --> 01:19:22,997
Well, time to go face the music.

1503
01:19:23,081 --> 01:19:25,668
You take care of yourself
if I don't see you, all right?

1504
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,253
You too, man.
Take her easy, bud.

1505
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:29,797
All right.

1506
01:19:30,923 --> 01:19:32,299
Hey, Peter.

1507
01:19:32,383 --> 01:19:34,051
Yeah?

1508
01:19:35,177 --> 01:19:36,845
Watch out for your cornhole,
bud.

1509
01:19:38,347 --> 01:19:39,765
OK, Lawrence.

1510
01:19:53,487 --> 01:19:55,991
Stay clear, now.
Stay clear.

1511
01:19:56,074 --> 01:19:58,243
Holy shit.

1512
01:21:07,731 --> 01:21:10,484
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at that.

1513
01:21:11,318 --> 01:21:12,694
You don't want that, Peter, man.

1514
01:21:12,778 --> 01:21:14,154
That's toasted, man.

1515
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:17,449
I think I know someone
who might want this.

1516
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:29,921
Hey, man.

1517
01:21:31,172 --> 01:21:32,966
Wanna go to lunch?

1518
01:21:33,716 --> 01:21:35,009
Brought mine in a pail...

1519
01:21:35,093 --> 01:21:37,679
plus Joanna's supposed
to come by a little later.

1520
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:41,099
How do you like your new job?

1521
01:21:41,182 --> 01:21:43,101
Not too bad, not too bad.

1522
01:21:43,184 --> 01:21:44,769
How's Penetrode?

1523
01:21:44,852 --> 01:21:46,479
Initrode.

1524
01:21:46,562 --> 01:21:47,855
They're all right.

1525
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:49,273
It's work.

1526
01:21:49,357 --> 01:21:51,025
Yeah, yeah.

1527
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,777
Probably get you a job there.

1528
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,654
No, thanks. I, uh...

1529
01:21:54,737 --> 01:21:56,155
I'm doing good here.

1530
01:21:57,991 --> 01:22:01,829
So, uh...
we're gonna be OK, right?

1531
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:03,747
Yeah.

1532
01:22:04,665 --> 01:22:07,126
I think the fire pretty much
took care of everything.

1533
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:09,795
I wonder if the money burn up.

1534
01:22:09,878 --> 01:22:11,130
It would be shame.

1535
01:22:11,213 --> 01:22:12,589
Yeah.

1536
01:22:12,673 --> 01:22:15,551
So you sure you don't
want us to get you a job?

1537
01:22:15,634 --> 01:22:18,929
That's one thing
I'm definitely sure of.

1538
01:22:21,098 --> 01:22:22,975
All right, chief.

1539
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:24,310
You guys take care, all right?

1540
01:22:24,393 --> 01:22:25,769
All right.

1541
01:22:26,895 --> 01:22:27,896
Stay in touch, man.

1542
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,733
OK. Will do.

1543
01:22:33,945 --> 01:22:35,864
This isn't so bad, huh?

1544
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:41,995
Making bucks, getting exercise,
working outside.

1545
01:22:42,078 --> 01:22:43,872
Fuckin' "A."

1546
01:22:46,499 --> 01:22:48,251
Fuckin' "A."

1547
01:23:06,729 --> 01:23:08,939
Excuse me. Excuse me, seסor.

1548
01:23:09,023 --> 01:23:10,900
May I speak to you, please?

1549
01:23:10,983 --> 01:23:13,569
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a piסa colada.

1550
01:23:13,653 --> 01:23:15,946
And I said no salt, no salt...

1551
01:23:16,030 --> 01:23:17,740
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1552
01:23:17,823 --> 01:23:20,409
Lo siento mucho, seסor.
Pinche gringo.

1553
01:23:20,493 --> 01:23:24,080
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1554
01:23:24,163 --> 01:23:25,998
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1555
01:23:26,082 --> 01:23:27,625
Sir?

1556
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:32,172
I'll take my traveller's cheques
to a competing resort.

1557
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:36,593
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1558
01:23:36,677 --> 01:23:38,929
I could have this place
condemned.

1559
01:23:39,012 --> 01:23:43,767
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1560
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:46,395
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1561
01:24:01,326 --> 01:24:03,287
Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1562
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,639
Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1563
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,933
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1564
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:47,916
I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1565
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,002
and it's very cool.

1566
01:24:51,305 --> 01:25:51,843
Watching movies won't make you rich.
