2
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,569
Good morning, everyone.
Here's the 8:35 weather and the news.

3
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,660
Right now, it's 29 degrees
and clear in midtown Manhattan.

4
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,100
Expect passing snow showers this morning,
clearing by midday.

5
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,725
Highs in the lower 30s.

6
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,860
Three NYPD officers are being
treated for gunshots this morning.

7
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,123
All three were shot in
the span of an hour last night.

8
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,086
Two officers were shot on the subway.

9
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,648
- You ready?
- Yeah.

10
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,845
You look very nice.

11
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,046
Thanks.

12
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,161
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

13
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,849
Morning. Morning.

14
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,770
Hey, handsome.

15
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,730
- Thank you.
- All right.

16
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,846
Okay.

17
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,965
Don't do anything stupid.

18
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,700
We don't have any more money left.

19
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,450
What else could I possibly do?

20
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,481
Hey, stop.

21
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,849
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!

22
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,060
Get out!

23
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,660
Get the fuck out of the truck!

24
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,620
Let's go! Let's go!

25
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,245
- Go, go, go!
- Come on!

26
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,366
I woke up this morning
feeling very good about this.

27
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,531
Really?

28
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,740
You've been telling me
not to do this for two years.

29
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,161
Now that we're all in, I'm loving it.

30
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,125
Yep. There we are.

31
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,242
My people have gone over your books.

32
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,086
I know this is a great deal
of money for you.

33
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,220
So why are you on us
so long for... for this...

34
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,563
this polluted, dirty piece of earth?

35
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,925
I imagine I want it
for the same reason you did.

36
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,242
I'm in the garment business,
so I take that as a testament.

37
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,140
But I inherited this property
from my uncle.

38
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,500
Sadly, he had no children of his own.

39
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,241
He was the one that let them
put these tanks up here.

40
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,128
So, you see, this place...
can do nothing for me.

41
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,321
I offered to lease this site
to you for a very fair price.

42
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,780
- But you're not interested.
- No.

43
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,405
Why is that?

44
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,609
I like to own the things I use.

45
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,125
I can see that.

46
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,281
So?

47
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,281
Yes.

48
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,660
Mr. Walsh has reviewed
the contract fully?

49
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,940
Of course.

50
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,780
- You brought the money?
- Yes.

51
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,123
You know you have only 30 days
to close the transaction?

52
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,180
No extensions.
No contingencies whatsoever.

53
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,740
I understand.

54
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,481
You fulfill the terms of the contract,
property is yours.

55
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,700
If you cannot, we keep the money...

56
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,380
and we sell the property
to your competitor...

57
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,529
who has been after us
almost as badly as you have.

58
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,801
I like you, but you should know
that the only reason we choose you...

59
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,940
is because of the favorable conditions
of the contract.

60
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,540
Yes.

61
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,449
- And once you sign the...
- I understand.

62
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,580
Well, show us... the money,
and, then I'll sign the papers.

63
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,170
Here it is.

64
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,500
Another case exactly like it.

65
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,806
Right here.

66
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,682
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

67
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,900
- Congratulations.
- It's not ours yet.

68
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,686
Hey. It was a hell of a job
getting them to this point.

69
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,487
This is a good day for us.

70
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,340
Why don't you take a walk around?

71
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,442
Enjoy it for a second.

72
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,289
They probably broke his jaw.

73
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,725
Are you all right?

74
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,961
Shit.

75
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,700
Have the police been here yet?

76
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,122
Well, he was left on the side of the highway
without a truck. They brought him here.

77
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,970
Can you speak?

78
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,681
Sí.

79
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,282
- Can I talk to you outside?
- Yeah.

80
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,610
Did they sign the contract?

81
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,330
- Yes.
- And took the deposit?

82
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,460
Oh, yeah.

83
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,449
- So it's a go.
- It's a go.

84
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,211
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. You too.

85
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,843
All right. We got 30 days.

86
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,603
These fucking guys.

87
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,700
This poor kid.
He's been working his ass off.

88
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,540
You want me to talk
to my brother about it?

89
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,980
No, no. Do not talk to your brother
or your father about this.

90
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,889
- All right?
- Okay.

91
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
- But this can't continue.
- Well, it won't.

92
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,180
I'm gonna go speak with the DA tomorrow.

93
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,931
Oh, fuck the DA.
He's not interested in helping us.

94
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,529
It's not fair to them.

95
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,522
- You're at war here.
- No, we're not.

96
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,120
- Really? Because they are.
- Well, I'm not.

97
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,060
You gonna check on the new house?

98
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,844
Yeah, I'll see you back home.

99
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,620
Do you need anything else?

100
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,806
Okay.

101
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,606
I'll be here to pick you up
when you get out.

102
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,641
Thank you.

103
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,523
These men are cowards.

104
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,240
They're too weak to make a living
or even fight with their own hands.

105
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,331
And too stupid to think
of anything else to do.

106
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,660
So, you guys have done
what you needed to?

107
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,286
- Yeah.
- And what was that?

108
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,580
I'm sorry?

109
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,500
Well, you just said you've done
what you needed to do.

110
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,060
So, what is it that you've done?

111
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,020
I'm not exactly sure, you know.
I just got here at 4:00.

112
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,940
My shift's actually up, so...

113
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,280
Right.

114
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,845
So, you've done nothing?

115
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,365
Hey, why'd they want it?

116
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,203
They wanted the $6,000
worth of fuel that was in it.

117
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,206
Trucks 14 through 23 are on the road.

118
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,404
Thirty to 33 are just about ready to go.

119
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,161
Nick, the gasket's good.
You should get over there and get going.

120
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,740
Andrew, sorry to keep you waiting.

121
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,205
Mr. Lawrence.

122
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,460
- Thanks for seeing us at the last minute.
- Of course.

123
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,690
And Mr. Morales. I didn't realize
you were coming as well.

124
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,689
- Yes.
- So, what can I do for you?

125
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,340
- We need your help.
- In what way?

126
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,980
Our trucks, they're being robbed.

127
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,980
As much as I'd like
to be able to help you...

128
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,401
you know this is a police issue...
it's not what we do here.

129
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,500
But this is turning into
an urgent problem for us.

130
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,460
Our drivers are scared to death.

131
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,289
I'm not sure I understand.

132
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,123
There were more murders and rapes in this
city last year than there have ever been.

133
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,767
So if you've come to tell me that we have
an urgent security issue here...

134
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,820
trust me, I'm aware.

135
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,924
My people are at risk
just driving around in this city.

136
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,500
Just trying to do their jobs.

137
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,601
And I...

138
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,340
I've done everything
that you've asked of me.

139
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,460
It's been two years since you started
investigating my company.

140
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,980
And since then, I've spent
thousands of dollars hiring lawyers...

141
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,500
to provide you with every piece of
information that your office has requested.

142
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,082
And I expect that you've been asking
the same of my competitors.

143
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,860
So with all this information
that you've gained...

144
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,900
we're just asking...

145
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,765
do you have any idea
who's been doing this to us?

146
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,650
I don't.

147
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,980
As you know, we've been investigating
industry-wide corruption in your business...

148
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,060
that seems
to have been going on for years.

149
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,020
So you're right.

150
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,804
That means you're all
stealing from each other...

151
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,900
which as far as I can tell
is just a refreshing new take...

152
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,220
on what you've been doing to your customers
and fellow taxpayers...

153
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,129
for the last 15 years.

154
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,580
First, please know that we respect
the work that you're doing...

155
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,900
to try to help our business
and the city.

156
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,209
But also know that I have never
taken anything from anyone.

157
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,650
So when you say that we've...

158
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,884
We're on the same side here.

159
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,683
Well, yes and no.

160
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,100
You know...

161
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,680
Mr. Morales, you seem like a decent man.

162
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,260
And because of that, I don't really
feel comfortable sitting here...

163
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,762
pretending like the elephant perched
on the corner of my desk isn't there.

164
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,180
So, you know,
I can't go into specifics right now...

165
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,340
but we believe that you and your company
have broken the law...

166
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,060
and that we have evidence to prove that.

167
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,210
So next week we will be
bringing a case against you.

168
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,620
It's a little awkward, obviously...

169
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,700
but, I didn't want to have
this happen next week...

170
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,300
not having said
something here in person.

171
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,004
You know, out of respect.

172
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,444
You have your job to do.

173
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,930
But know that you're wrong.

174
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,883
And we will take advantage
of every opportunity to prove that.

175
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,601
Abel.

176
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,127
Abel!

177
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,001
Exactly.

178
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,100
Let's not overreact.

179
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,740
We don't even know what this is yet.

180
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,940
We haven't seen any charges.
It could be bullshit.

181
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,089
His office might be toying with us.
Right now it's nothing.

182
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,651
I know.

183
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,045
Hey. How'd it go?

184
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,940
The DA says he's gonna
bring down charges on us next week.

185
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,180
What? Why?

186
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,805
We don't know yet.

187
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,965
Look, it might be nothing.

188
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,726
But I need to know,
where are we exposed?

189
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,690
We follow standard industry practice
on every front.

190
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,247
- What does that mean?
- You know what it means.

191
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,010
Anna.

192
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,322
I need to know
what they're saying we did.

193
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,500
Murder in a Brooklyn schoolyard.

194
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,128
And the hunt is on tonight for a gunman
who shot and killed a teenage student.

195
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,121
Well.

196
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,900
- Look who's here.
- Arnold.

197
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,048
Just a touch off the side, Jimmy.

198
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,180
We can't all be as lucky
as Mr. Morales here...

199
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,362
in terms of keeping our hair.

200
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,740
- You're a good-looking man.
- Thanks, Vinny.

201
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,524
I know I am.

202
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,166
So I hear congratulations are in order.

203
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,965
What's that?

204
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,560
You got yourself in contract over there.

205
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,220
Well, we're working on it.

206
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,220
Thirty-day close? You better be.

207
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,688
We are. Thanks for your concern.

208
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,046
I saw a couple of your trucks
over in Rego Park the other day.

209
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,721
Really?

210
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,004
When was that?

211
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,405
A couple times.

212
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,647
- It's possible.
- Is it?

213
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,886
Yes.

214
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,780
- It's a tough market.
- It is.

215
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,248
My father struggled for years
before he broke in there.

216
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,128
Any new market is a tough one. See ya.

217
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,640
Babe.

218
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,660
- Look.
- Everything all right?

219
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,161
- It's done.
- It is.

220
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,610
I love it.

221
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,980
What do you think, girls?

222
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,500
- It's really cool.
- It's amazing.

223
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,860
- You like it?
- I love it. I really like the door.

224
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,620
- You like? The color?
- You want that room?

225
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,291
Whoa. Really cool.

226
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,327
- What's... What's he doing?
- I don't know.

227
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,405
Hey!

228
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,205
It's okay. It's all right.

229
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,883
Hey! Hey!

230
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,405
Come back here!

231
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,444
Come here! Come here, you fuck!

232
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,490
Where did you go?

233
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,961
Abel?

234
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,442
- It's okay. Come on.
- Oh, my God.

235
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,850
Lot of help you were.

236
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,041
Come on.

237
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,810
- Ow.
- Who was it?

238
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,420
What do you mean, "Who was it"?

239
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,522
How am I supposed to know who it was?

240
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,250
I don't know.

241
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,247
It's probably some punk
trying to rip us off.

242
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,060
No. If you're not gonna be honest...

243
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,540
No, look. If he wanted
to send a message or something...

244
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,860
he could've... I don't know what...
and he didn't.

245
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,167
To me, it seems like a message was sent,
loud and clear.

246
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,489
Baby, please don't...
please don't get going on this.

247
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,844
We're a big, new house.

248
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,168
He probably just wanted the TV.

249
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,060
He didn't have anything on him.

250
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,650
Just some kid.

251
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,642
Alarm's gonna be in on... Wednesday.

252
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,570
I chased him away.

253
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,410
He's not coming back.

254
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,841
Okay?

255
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,561
Okay.

256
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,643
Now, you do this and only this.

257
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,523
You look down at the cloth.

258
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,045
You don't say a word.

259
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,602
You just stare down at the cloth...

260
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,930
and very slowly
just start shaking your head.

261
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,003
Then after sitting in silence way longer
than feels comfortable...

262
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,771
you turn... and you say...

263
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,100
"I would love to run
a few numbers for you.

264
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,362
Is there somewhere
more comfortable we could sit?"

265
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,940
Now, they're almost always gonna take you
to the dining room table.

266
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,580
And they're gonna offer you something.

267
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,900
Whatever it is,
always take the fancy option.

268
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,340
- Can I get you a coffee or a tea?
- I would like a tea, please.

269
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,740
We have some homemade lemonade
or a soda.

270
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,968
I would love a lemonade, thank you.

271
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,980
Why?

272
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,500
Because we're never gonna be
the cheapest option.

273
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,340
So we have to be the best.

274
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,460
And they want... No.

275
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,540
They need to feel
that you want the best too.

276
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,820
That's why our trucks
are the newest or the cleanest.

277
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,729
And our drivers are approachable.

278
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,820
Now, after you've done the math...

279
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,500
and you've shown them how much
they can save over the long haul...

280
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,060
through proper maintenance...

281
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,003
you need to get them to sign.

282
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,380
But the problem is, by hiring you...

283
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,540
they need to fire someone else.

284
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,340
And that's never easy.

285
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,650
So after you show them the number...

286
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,243
you look up at them and stare.

287
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,123
Stare longer than you should.

288
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,725
This is not a joke.

289
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,806
You will only keep this job if you close,
and that's not funny to you.

290
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,060
I'm only interested
in this company growing...

291
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,811
and when it isn't,
it's not very funny to me at all.

292
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,220
These people work very hard
for their money.

293
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,220
And these other guys
are ripping them off...

294
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,800
treating them poorly
because they don't know.

295
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,340
So when you look them in the eye...

296
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,140
you have to believe that we are better.

297
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,765
And we are.

298
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,528
But you will never do anything as hard
as staring someone straight in the eye...

299
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,170
and telling the truth.

300
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,210
Well, it was great to meet you.

301
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,129
Welcome, and I wish you luck.

302
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,044
- You ready?
- Sure.

303
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,620
If there's anything you need,
anything at all...

304
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,688
don't hesitate to call the office.

305
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,289
I'm sorry this happened to you.

306
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,204
See you soon.

307
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,765
Abel. Abel.

308
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,647
Do you think I'm ready
to move into sales?

309
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,528
No, I don't.

310
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,445
- I don't think I'll be able to...
- You will.

311
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,889
Get some rest.

312
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,606
Catherine?

313
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,970
Catherine. Catherine! Katie!

314
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,651
Where did you get this? Catherine?

315
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,500
- Tell me where you found this.
- Here in the yard.

316
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,489
Show me! Where?

317
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,210
Go on.

318
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,860
- It was just sitting right here behind...
- Did you see this?

319
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,420
Well, yeah, she went under there
to get that ball and came out with it.

320
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,420
- Maria!
- Is it real?

321
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,727
- Are we in trouble?
- Maria!

322
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,020
Caused by the drift of soft silt
from the sides of the...

323
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,500
Hey, Debbie. Can you give us a moment?

324
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,681
Sure.

325
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,680
- What is that?
- It's a gun.

326
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,687
It's a fucking gun.

327
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,485
Where did you get that?

328
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,364
Your youngest daughter found it
in the bushes outside our front door.

329
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,700
She was playing with it.

330
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,725
Look. It's loaded. With the safety off.

331
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,220
It wasn't some kid looking
to take our TV.

332
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,848
It was a fucking goon with a loaded gun
looking in our window.

333
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,370
I'll take care of it.

334
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,045
What does that mean
when you say you'll take care of it?

335
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,900
It's not a brick through a car window...

336
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,005
or another of the cute little warnings
over the past few years.

337
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,326
This is your kid playing
with a loaded gun.

338
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,602
I know what it is!

339
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,245
Let me deal with it.

340
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,890
Oh, you better.

341
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,850
You're not gonna like
what'll happen once I get involved.

342
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,485
Don't do this.

343
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,000
I won't.

344
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,280
I, need to talk to you both.

345
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,049
I found a gun outside our front door.

346
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,930
Somebody left it there last night.

347
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,883
- Who?
- We don't know who.

348
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,611
Jesus.

349
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,771
So...

350
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,410
It's not good. It's bad.

351
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,860
The DA's coming down
with charges tomorrow.

352
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,940
- Oh, my God.
- It's a 14-count indictment.

353
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,281
Three counts I would consider serious.

354
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,220
They know how the industry works...

355
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,006
so they're gonna charge us with rigging
scales and underreporting income.

356
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,806
We've just pushed it a little too far,
that's all.

357
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,170
Let's look at it like a badge of honor.

358
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,850
We're big enough now
they even give a shit about us.

359
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,060
You need to go home right away...

360
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,580
and start going through
our set of books.

361
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,460
How far back are they going?

362
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,450
I would imagine when you bought
the business from Anna's father.

363
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,885
I'll get into it.

364
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,020
One other thing. The bank.

365
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,940
I need you two to sit down with them.
I set up a dinner.

366
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,380
I want you both there.
Just be up front. Be honest.

367
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,140
I don't anticipate a problem.

368
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,180
God knows they've given money
to bigger crooks than us.

369
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,169
Jesus. All right.

370
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,281
- How are you, Bill?
- I'm okay.

371
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,540
I can't say I'm used to making house calls
like this anymore though.

372
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,100
Well, I would've come to see you.

373
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,726
That's all right.
You got bigger things to worry about.

374
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,205
So...

375
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,020
I can't have this situation
with your guys continuing.

376
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,724
- My guys.
- Your drivers.

377
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,842
Yes, yes. Well, good, good.

378
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,260
I would love for you to help with this,
because I can't have it continue either.

379
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,100
So let them protect themselves.
That would stop all this very quickly.

380
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,100
I respectfully disagree.

381
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,820
They're picking on your men
because they're just sitting there weak.

382
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,242
They're taking shots at me
because I'm growing, expanding.

383
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,249
I'm getting stronger, not weaker.

384
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,727
I can't have my drivers
getting hit like this anymore.

385
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,620
It looks like I can't protect them.

386
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,404
Well, it appears that you can't.

387
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,204
You seem to be under
a lot of pressure from all sides.

388
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,580
Which I understand.

389
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,127
Trust me. I understand that. So...

390
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,565
Let me think this through.

391
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,560
But whatever decision
I come to, it stands.

392
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,089
Those men show up every morning for you
because I tell 'em to.

393
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,460
You have to realize...

394
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,404
that these are dangerous times
and we have to adapt.

395
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,761
It's not like when we was driving.

396
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,089
No. No, it's not.

397
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,365
So how did it go?

398
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,685
Not well.

399
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,620
He feels very strongly about it.

400
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,245
I can see that.

401
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,528
I don't think he fully understands.

402
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,048
What is there to understand?

403
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,445
Well...

404
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,700
Well, first of all, it's illegal.

405
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,167
It's not illegal if I say it isn't.

406
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,740
My responsibility is to provide...

407
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,140
safe and timely passage
of goods and products...

408
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,163
into and around this city.

409
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,900
And because of this situation...

410
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,620
it is appearing to those
whose opinions I care about...

411
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,370
that I can't do my job.

412
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,965
That cannot and will not continue.

413
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,340
Well, I'm not even sure
what you're suggesting.

414
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,205
- Are you kidding me with this?
- No.

415
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,886
Every driver in your fleet
gets a handgun.

416
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,420
- And a permit.
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,364
- When?
- By Friday.

418
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,489
Are the permits legit?

419
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,602
Well, it depends
on what they do with it.

420
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,060
If they kill their wife with them, then no,
then that is a very fake permit...

421
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,100
and I'll walk away very quickly.

422
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,048
But they just need to show that they're
defending themselves, and it'll stop.

423
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,008
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

424
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,122
I don't fucking know.

425
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,165
Thank you.

426
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,006
Hey.

427
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,924
Check out this machine.

428
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,162
I was paying a guy five bucks an hour
to do this with me last year.

429
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,528
- Peter.
- Yeah?

430
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,810
I need to speak with you.

431
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,980
Oh, I see that.

432
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:01,484
Look, I know you've been dealing with a few
of your rigs getting picked off as well.

433
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,441
But this has all gotten
way out of control.

434
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,801
There was a guy with a gun at my house
the other night.

435
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,887
My wife and children
were home at the time.

436
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,125
Is everyone okay?

437
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,044
Yeah. I managed to chase him off.

438
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,685
What can I do?

439
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,562
I need to know who's doing this.

440
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,100
Abel...

441
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,060
It... It's one thing
to go after my trucks and my drivers...

442
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,980
and to steal from me.

443
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,605
This is different.

444
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,688
Have you ever had to deal
with anything like this?

445
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,500
A bunch of thugs invaded my home
when I was a baby.

446
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,740
Nothing happened.
They were trying to scare my father.

447
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,380
They ended up just leaving,
and we never found out who it was.

448
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,328
But after that,
we moved to a fortress just like this.

449
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,407
And those guys who let you in?

450
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,806
They're here to shoot anyone
who isn't invited.

451
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,260
Yes, well, I refuse to live
my life that way.

452
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,089
I won't do it.

453
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,484
I want more than this.

454
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,890
I know you do.

455
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,122
My father's in jail, as you know.

456
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,925
And I always wanted to conduct myself
differently than he did.

457
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,530
And you have.

458
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,362
Almost exclusively, yes.

459
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,963
I know why he did what he did.

460
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,690
'Cause at the time it's easier.

461
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,045
But it's not.

462
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,725
Yes, it is.

463
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,724
Where is he now?

464
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,460
I just dropped him off at the hospital.

465
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,340
He seems fine.

466
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,090
I think you should come on in.

467
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,845
Hey.

468
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,450
I'm on my way back.

469
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,602
They just got another truck.

470
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,686
I know.

471
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,290
Who was driving?

472
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,570
Leo.

473
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,170
Is he all right?

474
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,925
Yes.

475
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,928
You know, drivers' security aside...

476
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,100
this shit is having a significant
financial effect on this company.

477
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,060
It... It can't continue.

478
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,491
Oh, I know.

479
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,700
How was your talk?
I spoke with him afterward.

480
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,643
I said I wouldn't do it.

481
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,807
I don't think we're in a position
to say that.

482
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,580
What's that?

483
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,780
Why don't you take a walk with me?
Come on.

484
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,611
Are you serious with this? Is this...
Is this... This is what it's come to?

485
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,205
We have to walk around outside
like we're fucking gangsters?

486
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,283
I am, and it is.

487
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,121
It looks like we must do this.

488
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,886
- We must?
- Yeah. They'll shut us down.

489
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,500
The... These men, they work for me.

490
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,180
The trucks they drive,
the customers they serve...

491
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,760
it's all here because I built this.

492
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,804
That's true. Until it isn't.

493
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,740
The last guy in the world
that we want problems with...

494
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,571
is the head of the fucking Teamsters.

495
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,740
We're out of business in a month
if they tell these guys to walk.

496
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,260
We don't have the cash.

497
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,020
It will be the end of everything
that we have worked for.

498
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,540
If one of these guys shoots someone,
they're gonna bring me down for it.

499
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,165
I'm not gonna do it.

500
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,325
I'll talk to him.

501
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,340
We need to close this deal.

502
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,420
We cannot stay like this any longer.

503
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,900
We have to close on that property.

504
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,048
We're so weak right now.

505
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,251
Why do you want this so badly?

506
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,606
Because I've got my entire savings
at risk on this deposit.

507
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,020
No, no, no, no.
I don't mean the deposit.

508
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,442
I mean... this. Why do you want it?

509
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,210
Have you ever thought about it?

510
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,100
Yes, I've thought about it. I've thought
about it every day for the last five years.

511
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,540
That place has just been sitting
right across that fence mocking me.

512
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,460
I'm not talking about that place.

513
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,245
I-I-I just meant... everything.

514
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,204
Why do you want it so much?

515
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,764
I have no idea what you mean.

516
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,724
- Arthur.
- Anna.

517
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,900
- You look as lovely as always.
- Thank you.

518
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,500
Gentlemen, do you know Ian Thompson?
One of our new VPs.

519
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,489
- Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

520
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,567
You're good? Good.

521
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,820
All right.

522
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,500
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah.

523
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,100
What can I get you to drink?

524
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,740
A lot. Wine list, please.

525
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,365
I'll be right back.

526
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,881
So, how are you?

527
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,446
We've been better. But we're good.

528
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,460
Yes, I heard about that.

529
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,962
If you stay in business long enough,
it's bound to happen eventually.

530
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,730
Well, that's exactly right, Arthur.

531
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,740
And that's why we wanted
to sit down with you tonight...

532
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,100
and be up front about everything
that's going on...

533
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,500
make sure you understand
the nature of the complaints...

534
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,180
and that, even in a worst...
case scenario...

535
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,420
we'll move forward
with very comfortable capital on hand.

536
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,660
Yes, but you should know, Arthur...

537
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,300
that this man has been
digging through our industry...

538
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,260
looking for anything he can find,
for the last two years now.

539
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,180
And the thought that he would
single us out... it's ridiculous.

540
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,805
Thank you.

541
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,700
I run a fair and clean business...

542
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,820
and we follow every standard
industry practice.

543
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,700
And I will fight
to my last breath to prove that.

544
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,860
But don't think for a moment...

545
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,725
that I'm gonna let this mess
interfere with our plans to grow.

546
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,808
And we need to know
that you're standing with us.

547
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,931
Yes.

548
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,001
What is it about this property
that makes you feel it's so integral...

549
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,964
that you can't put it off until after
all these legal matters are settled?

550
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,328
That's a very good question.

551
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,482
This property gives us many things.

552
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,849
First, access to the river...

553
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,500
so I can bring in my fuel directly
from any provider in the world...

554
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,060
straight to my tanks.

555
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,006
Second, it has over 10 million gallons
of storage capacity...

556
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,780
so I can buy in the summers
when the price is low...

557
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,260
and sell to my customers
and, more importantly, my competitors...

558
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,850
when the price is high.

559
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,690
I will no longer just drive trucks.
I will control my fate.

560
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,202
But the real answer to your question...

561
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,163
is that when it feels scary
to jump, Ian...

562
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,529
that is exactly when you jump.

563
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,371
Otherwise, you end up staying
in the same place your whole life...

564
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,723
and that I can't do.

565
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,980
We've always been there with you...

566
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,085
and know... that we will continue to be.

567
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,540
- Good.
- Thanks, Arthur.

568
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,608
- That's great.
- I don't think we have to eat.

569
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,409
That went really good.

570
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,088
Arthur's a good man.

571
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,403
They're gonna close.

572
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,330
Of course.

573
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,080
Shit. Are you okay?

574
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,660
- You all right?
- What the...

575
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,444
What the fuck was that?

576
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,725
It was a deer.

577
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,080
- It's still alive.
- Shit.

578
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,940
- You've got to put it out of its misery.
- Oh, Jesus.

579
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,220
I mean it. You can't leave it like that.

580
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,401
Goddamn it.

581
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,686
Shit.

582
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,806
- Is it dead?
- No.

583
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,820
- Well, you need to...
- I know.

584
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,082
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting the tire iron.

585
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,726
Hi, Maria. So sorry we're late.

586
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,364
- The girls okay?
- Oh, yes. All is good.

587
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,860
You can go home now.
We'll see you in the morning.

588
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,371
Okay.

589
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,570
- What?
- What?

590
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,849
Yeah? What?

591
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,260
Okay, Anna.

592
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,260
What's with the gun?

593
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,540
I told you I wasn't gonna continue
to stand around...

594
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,802
and let these people
come and get me and my children.

595
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,860
So unlike you...

596
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,540
who seems to be completely comfortable just
standing around like some fucking pussy...

597
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,324
I decided to do something about it.

598
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,324
Where did you get it?

599
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,660
You know where I got it.

600
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,569
And do you have a permit?

601
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,340
Not yet.

602
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:04,340
Then you must be a bigger fucking idiot
than I even thought.

603
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,283
You wanna protect your children?

604
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,900
Protect them?

605
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,300
Do you have any idea
what happens to you...

606
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,641
If they catch you using that thing?

607
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,740
You dress yourself up
in these fancy clothes.

608
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,340
And look at you here in your mansion.

609
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,220
I've given you everything
you could possibly ask for...

610
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,780
and you still can't help acting...

611
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,180
like this little Brooklyn corner-store
gangster's daughter that you are.

612
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,500
Are you delusional?

613
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,020
Do you really understand
how ridiculous that makes...

614
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,860
- Abel.
- I wanna see this thing.

615
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,140
This? This?

616
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,740
You're gonna protect yourself with this?

617
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,366
You know who uses guns like these?
Whores!

618
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,208
You're walking us right into a trap.

619
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,082
And you can't even see it.

620
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,727
This is not allowed in my fucking house.

621
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,728
Then you need to protect us.

622
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,322
That is what I'm doing.

623
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,485
No, no, no.

624
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,660
- Can I help you?
- One at a time. Birthday girl first.

625
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,444
- Please.
- In a minute.

626
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,731
- Gracias, Maria.
- Mr. Morales.

627
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,460
- Guys...
- We don't want any trouble.

628
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,642
- Are you serious?
- We don't want any trouble here.

629
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,721
- What'll we play?
- Here you go.

630
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,007
As you can see, I'm in the middle
of my daughter's birthday party.

631
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,780
I understand and I apologize. I do.

632
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,340
But this is a warrant, and we need to gain
complete access to the property.

633
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,965
What is this?

634
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,130
Let me check something.

635
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,850
Is he serious?

636
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,122
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.

637
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,290
They got a birthday party going on.

638
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,401
- Abel.
- He's saying it's a bad time.

639
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,805
Give me five minutes.

640
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,360
Maria. Keep the kids playing.

641
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,460
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

642
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,820
Anna Morales.

643
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,649
May I speak with you for a minute?

644
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,380
I understand you and your men
have a job to do here...

645
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,563
but we're in the middle
of a 10-year-old's birthday party.

646
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,700
I understand,
and I'm sorry, but we are coming in.

647
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,646
That's not a problem. We have nothing
to hide from you. It's just...

648
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,540
Well, we...
we just moved into the area...

649
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,168
and... I have 20 guests inside my home.

650
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,860
Can you give me five minutes...

651
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,042
so I can ask everyone to leave calmly...

652
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,162
before you guys come into my house?

653
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,730
You can get them out of the house.

654
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,570
Thank you.

655
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,100
Where are you putting them?

656
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,700
Oh, shit.

657
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,370
Hand me those.

658
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,860
You have... three minutes.

659
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,500
What's going on out there?

660
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,170
Our guests are leaving.

661
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,620
Jesus. Anna.

662
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,780
Why do we even have to be doing this?
What are we hiding here?

663
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,248
I don't want them to go through these
before I have a chance to.

664
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,888
Go. Get back in there.

665
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,060
Here you go. Here you go.

666
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,860
Thank you. One for you.

667
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,485
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

668
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,410
Here you go...

669
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,885
Come on, honey.

670
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,010
Excuse me, ma'am.

671
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,290
Here you go, sweetheart.

672
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,969
Can we get you something to drink?

673
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,010
No. I'm good.

674
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,921
This is probably
one you're gonna regret.

675
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,446
Excuse me?

676
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,203
My husband's an honorable man.

677
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,004
We're not who you think we are.

678
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,004
I think I know your father.

679
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,930
Good for you.

680
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,650
My husband is not my father.

681
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,130
Not even close.

682
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,124
So if I were you...

683
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,060
I would start treating us
with a little more respect...

684
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,300
or I guarantee...

685
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,689
he will make it
his mission in life to ruin you.

686
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,007
This was very disrespectful.

687
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,722
And you're not gonna find
a fucking thing.

688
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,164
Trucks 14 through 23 are on the road.

689
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,891
Thirty to 33 are just about ready to go.

690
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,483
Six, what are you doing back here?

691
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,300
Hey. How are you?

692
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,845
I'm... good.

693
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,060
I'm a little bit nervous.
I'm heading on my first calls alone today.

694
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,449
You'll be great. Just hold the eye contact
longer than you'd like.

695
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,725
You'll see what happens.

696
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,044
Good luck.

697
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,563
- Hey.
- Hey.

698
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,610
Glad to see you back here.

699
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,330
You look good.

700
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,123
You ready to get back to work?

701
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,725
English.

702
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,605
I think so.

703
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,290
You are.

704
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,410
Where you heading?

705
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,060
Bulk delivery to Chase.

706
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,561
Manhattan. It's a cakewalk.

707
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,130
I feel...

708
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,500
vulnerable.

709
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,011
Good.

710
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,449
Because you are vulnerable.

711
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,603
We all are.

712
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,124
But to be successful and great...

713
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,923
you must keep going back.

714
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,887
And I know what these guys
wanna be doing.

715
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,288
But that doesn't make you any safer.

716
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,764
'Cause then they'll come back at us
with everything they have.

717
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,607
So this is what we do.

718
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,684
We keep going back.

719
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,169
And the times will get better
and get safer... They will.

720
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,801
So go.

721
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,689
You're strong just by going.

722
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,290
Stronger, in fact.

723
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,490
Thank you.

724
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,940
Mr. Rose?

725
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,020
- I'm Alex, with Standard Heating Oil.
- Nice to meet you, kid.

726
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,740
I was just about to show your wife
the results of my inspection.

727
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,340
Should we head upstairs,
run through some numbers?

728
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,820
Sure. I just had one question
about the exhaust chimney.

729
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,604
Would you be willing to take a look?

730
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,884
Of course.

731
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,848
I'm gonna head up.
Can I get you something to drink?

732
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,540
Coffee? Tea?

733
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,483
Tea would be great.

734
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,211
Awesome. I'm a coffee man myself.

735
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,980
- Here you go.
- All right.

736
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,809
So, what exactly was the problem?

737
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,700
Kathy. Kathy! Kathy!

738
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,100
On the 59th Street Bridge. Kathy!

739
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,820
- Who is that?
- Kathy. Over.

740
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,420
They're coming again. Help!

741
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,620
- Julian?
- Help!

742
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,324
- Where are you?
- Help!

743
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,285
Julian!

744
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,245
Julian!

745
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,980
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.
- "Whoa, whoa." Fuck you!

746
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,700
- Relax. What are you doing?
- Relax? You fucking relax!

747
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,100
Put it down.
What are you doing? Got a fucking gun!

748
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,740
Look, you wanna do this?

749
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,100
Look! What, you want me
to fucking shoot?

750
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,700
You wanna kill someone? Think about it.

751
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,609
Go back, you piece of shit!

752
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,140
- John, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

753
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,730
- Did he hit you?
- No.

754
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,730
Where is he?

755
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,980
He's in front of the truck.

756
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,731
There's people out here!
You're gonna kill somebody!

757
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,127
You should have thought about that
before you came!

758
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,284
- Jesus!
- What?

759
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,060
Cops! Cops!

760
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,322
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

761
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,803
- Back in the car, John!
- They're coming from that direction.

762
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,020
Fuck.

763
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,610
I'm running.

764
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,650
You better run, cuz.

765
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,300
- Back in your car.
- Oh, shit.

766
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,060
- Get back!
- Stay in the car.

767
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,161
Go, go, go!

768
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,201
Freeze!

769
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,580
Oh, there he is.

770
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,364
Got to be the hero?

771
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,730
Oh, fuck you.

772
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,211
Couldn't just let us take
the fucking truck.

773
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,529
Did they see you come in here?

774
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,329
Man, I don't think so.

775
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,020
- Did they or not? Yes or no.
- No!

776
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,726
Look, there's a door down here
about four more flights.

777
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,680
You come out under the bridge.
It's a park.

778
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,728
- Fuck you!
- You're welcome.

779
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,770
Where's the truck now?

780
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,009
It's still up on the bridge.

781
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,687
- How many shots were fired?
- I don't know.

782
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,282
Kathy, it's me.
What are you talking about? What shots?

783
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,725
It's 16. Someone shot up his truck
on the 59th Street Bridge.

784
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,540
It was Julian.

785
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,130
He's gone.

786
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,485
He ran away

787
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,481
Abel?

788
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,324
I don't know about that.

789
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,009
Can you give us a minute, please?

790
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,204
- Please...
- Do not...

791
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,160
I heard.

792
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,606
We had nothing to do with this.

793
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,963
This is not the way that I do business.

794
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,140
In fact, I've been warning my men
against this very thing.

795
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:46,740
This is terrible for me.

796
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,447
- It's not good... for either of us.
- I know.

797
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,420
In my job,
we use whatever leverage we can gain...

798
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,580
as I'm sure you do in your business.

799
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,500
This is an ongoing investigation...

800
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,460
and this incident will just be
one piece of many.

801
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,767
So, as much as I appreciate
you coming here...

802
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,649
I got nothing I can tell you.

803
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,807
What a fucking mess this is.

804
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,650
You know where he is?

805
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,460
No.

806
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,928
When you do, bring him to us.

807
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,620
A situation like this happening
in such a dangerous and public way...

808
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,380
within an industry
that I'm charged with cleaning up...

809
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,403
is very bad for me.

810
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,725
I'll find him.

811
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:42,700
Right now it's 24 degrees
in midtown Manhattan.

812
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,420
Look for increasing cloudiness today,..

813
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:49,580
With a chance of light showers,
with highs in the upper20s.

814
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,940
A masked slasher is at large on the streets
of midtown Manhattan.

815
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,540
- No, no, no, no, no.
- The killer has struck at least four times.

816
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,820
Three of his victims
were black or Hispanic.

817
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,780
Witnesses to two
of the stabbing deaths...

818
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,500
describe a stocky white man
wearing wire-rimmed glasses...

819
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,204
who approached his victims...

820
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,285
Okay.

821
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,020
- Abel.
- Arthur.

822
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,964
I wanted to come
and talk to you in person.

823
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,700
We're not gonna be able
to show up for you on Thursday.

824
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,260
We can't do the loan.

825
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,460
I wanted to let you know
as soon as possible...

826
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,881
so you could try to put
something else together.

827
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,289
Thank you for coming.

828
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,764
- This is not right.
- I know.

829
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,967
And you are aware of the position
that this is putting me in?

830
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,605
I am.

831
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,380
Arthur, I paid off my first loan to you
11 years ago.

832
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,900
- I know.
- Do you remember the term on that loan?

833
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,540
- I don't.
- I had five years to pay you back.

834
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,060
Do you know
how long it took me to pay you off?

835
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,700
- Seven months.
- Six and a half.

836
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,740
I'm sorry.

837
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,100
I put 40% down deposit
on this property...

838
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,900
because you said
that you would be there.

839
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,211
You now have three serious separate
pending legal cases against you...

840
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,660
one with 16 counts of misconduct...

841
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,900
ranging from fraud to tax evasion.

842
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,780
And then today,
in the middle of our meeting...

843
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:21,740
I get a report saying you had armed
your entire fleet of drivers...

844
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:24,420
which led to a shoot... out
on the 59th Street Bridge.

845
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,251
- None of that is true.
- That may be.

846
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,650
"May"?

847
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,250
It doesn't matter.

848
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,004
It does matter.

849
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,100
It matters that you know
we didn't do this.

850
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,522
I do. I do.

851
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,966
But it doesn't matter.
I can't do anything.

852
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,723
I'm sorry.

853
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,690
I'll find it.

854
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,490
I know you will.

855
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,086
Come on.

856
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,604
It's horrible.

857
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,285
Yes.

858
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,490
Where is he?

859
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,685
We're looking for him.

860
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,060
Have they found the other guys yet?

861
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,810
No. Of course not.

862
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,050
You okay?

863
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,210
No, I'm not okay.

864
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,700
They're out.

865
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,961
Who?

866
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,846
The bank.

867
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,364
What does that mean?

868
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,684
We'll find the money somewhere else.
That's what it means.

869
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,369
We have two days.

870
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,610
No.

871
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,450
No.

872
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,490
Julian. Julian, stop running!

873
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,090
Andrew, he's coming to you!

874
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,809
We got him!

875
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,540
He's turning me in?

876
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,688
Of course we're turning you in.

877
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,962
You put everything he's worked for
for the last 20 years at risk.

878
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,281
If it was up to me, we'd be doing this
in a very different way.

879
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,380
They said you fired off four shots.

880
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,005
Is that right?

881
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,851
- I don't know.
- Where's the gun?

882
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,003
I... I threw it in the river.

883
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,051
Good.

884
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:29,420
When we did our background check,
it said you'd never been arrested.

885
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,010
Is that true?

886
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,340
Why is this putting everything at risk?

887
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:37,364
I asked you
if you've ever been arrested.

888
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,340
No.

889
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:43,125
Because no bank will touch us.

890
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,220
Because if he can't close
on that piece of property...

891
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,210
then your buddy here loses everything.

892
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,885
That's why.

893
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,805
Here.

894
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,846
This is an attorney
that'll meet you at the station.

895
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,170
You no longer work for us.
You've been fired.

896
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,403
Abel would like to pay for the lawyer.

897
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,410
Good luck.

898
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,650
I'm sorry.

899
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,765
I know.

900
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,885
I was scared.

901
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,540
- Yeah, I know.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

902
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,722
And you don't get scared?

903
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:53,404
I've always been a lot more afraid
of failure than of anything else.

904
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,606
It wasn't always like this.

905
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,764
I am sorry.

906
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,121
Good.

907
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,125
Okay.

908
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,460
Don't. Don't.

909
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,900
I'm not... I'm not strong.

910
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,490
Don't.

911
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,860
Well, that doesn't have to be true.

912
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,100
Listen to me. Trust me. Trust me.

913
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,460
- I'm not...
- Julian. Julian.

914
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,085
That's... That's enough.

915
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,490
Hey.

916
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,890
I am sorry.

917
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,260
- He's running!
- Hey!

918
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,691
Stop him!

919
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,180
Officers in pursuit! Suspect on foot!

920
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:16,520
Stop him!

921
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,043
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Of course.

922
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,620
Actually, I think we have met before...

923
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,300
but I didn't realize that you were
Saul's granddaughter.

924
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,401
I am.

925
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,020
My grandfather didn't trust
any of his children to run the business.

926
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,121
Yes.

927
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,402
I know that you tried to buy the company
from my grandfather several times.

928
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,980
His goal was to stay healthy...

929
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,940
long enough to be able
to give the company to me...

930
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,361
which he thankfully did.

931
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,020
So while I appreciate your visit...

932
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,660
we are still not for sale.

933
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:33,445
I'm not here to offer to buy
your company.

934
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,660
Oh.

935
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:37,380
But as you will soon learn...

936
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,485
some years are good and others not so.

937
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,340
I am under contract with a significant
hard deposit at risk...

938
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,180
to purchase the old Bayfront terminal.

939
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,740
I see.

940
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,365
And...

941
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:03,129
due to circumstances
out of my control...

942
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:07,970
my bank has left me at the altar.

943
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,645
So I'm here...

944
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,244
hat in hand...

945
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,010
looking for a loan.

946
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,361
I certainly expect
the terms to be in your favor.

947
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,486
But if your grandfather
trusted you with his company...

948
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,322
then I would be willing
to trust you as my lien holder.

949
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,969
How much?

950
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,888
I need a million and a half dollars.

951
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,729
Would you give us a minute?

952
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,645
Yes?

953
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,090
Oh.

954
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:16,929
You can go back in.

955
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,300
We can offer you 500,000
at 20% for a year.

956
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,140
And we would need a five-year straight
wholesale holding agreement...

957
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,926
for 250,000 gallons a year
at your new facility.

958
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,605
Okay.

959
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,245
Thank you.

960
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,890
Thank you.

961
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,060
So, I should start by thanking you...

962
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:09,084
for your assistance
in attempting to bring in the driver.

963
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,980
Yeah, we didn't expect him
to react that way.

964
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,300
Yeah, well, the officers there didn't
set it up very well on their end either.

965
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,401
I'm sorry.

966
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:19,500
Miss Lange.

967
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,780
It has been brought to our attention...

968
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,980
that it might be beneficial
on your end...

969
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,740
to resolve this issue
in a time-sensitive way.

970
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,860
It's a possibility.

971
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,965
So we have prepared
an offer for you to review.

972
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,763
I'll present it to him.

973
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,483
It's good, Andrew.

974
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,201
Okay.

975
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,500
I need more time.

976
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,244
Of course you do.

977
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,860
I know our agreement
doesn't allow for that.

978
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,449
But I need more time.

979
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,166
It is a difficult time to do business.

980
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:43,049
Yes. Yes, it is.

981
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,204
I...

982
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,460
I'll give you three days.

983
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,927
But then it's over.

984
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,247
Thank you. Thank you, Joseph.

985
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,245
You're welcome.

986
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,530
Oh.

987
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,767
Abel. Please, sit down.

988
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,620
- Andrew.
- Yes.

989
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,722
- How are you?
- I'm well.

990
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,245
Abel.

991
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,530
Stop.

992
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,766
Abel, we had a chance to meet
for a little bit before you got here.

993
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:13,660
And, of course, everyone in this room...

994
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,321
is fully capable of lying to
their own mothers on their deathbeds.

995
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,660
But the conclusion that we've come to...

996
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,780
and I should say
that we feel fairly certain...

997
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:27,121
after a very frank conversation...

998
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,563
that the guys who are doing this...

999
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,321
that they're not actually
working for anyone in this room.

1000
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:40,860
As you know, there are plenty
of other smaller providers in the area...

1001
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,328
that might have something to do with it
who are not here tonight, so...

1002
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,005
Peter, thank you.

1003
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,290
Thank you. That may be true.

1004
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:54,940
But over the last six months...

1005
01:24:55,040 --> 01:25:00,444
110,000 gallons of fuel
have been stolen from me and my family.

1006
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,288
Now, the reason we asked Bill
to get you all here...

1007
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,140
is because the people at this table...

1008
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:13,380
are the only people
within 200 miles of here...

1009
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:19,647
that have the ability to purchase
and store that kind of quantity.

1010
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,571
So...

1011
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:29,364
No matter what bullshit
you've been telling each other...

1012
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,003
one of you... or two...

1013
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,165
or three...

1014
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,100
have been allowing this to happen
by buying it from these cowards...

1015
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:42,680
or worse yet, hiring them to do it.

1016
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,043
So what I'm saying is stop.

1017
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,726
Now.

1018
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,283
Have some pride in what you do...

1019
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,885
and stop.

1020
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,121
Hi.

1021
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,050
Hi.

1022
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:46,049
How's it coming?

1023
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,924
I got to 1975.

1024
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,204
1975. That was a good year.

1025
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,090
No?

1026
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:03,409
- How is it?
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.

1027
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,601
But I don't think it's as bad
as they're saying it is.

1028
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,488
I guess I kind of knew what I was doing.

1029
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,260
How'd you do?

1030
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:19,420
Got us three more days.

1031
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,140
That's great.

1032
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,288
And I got a piece from Saul.

1033
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,248
But we're still about a million short.

1034
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,284
When are you gonna go see
your little brother?

1035
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,290
First thing.

1036
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,540
And Peter?

1037
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,051
Probably.

1038
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:55,620
How are the girls?

1039
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:57,802
Feel like I haven't seen them forever.

1040
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:01,005
They're fine.

1041
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,248
When I was putting them
to bed tonight...

1042
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:15,682
I told them
that their dad was out there...

1043
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,689
taking care of us.

1044
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:25,961
I said that whatever he wanted...

1045
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,010
he was gonna get...

1046
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,208
and that there was no man...

1047
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,691
No man would ever stand in his way.

1048
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,449
This is all worth it.

1049
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,002
- Of course.
- Hey.

1050
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,883
Look at us. It is.

1051
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,008
I know.

1052
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,130
I know.

1053
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,651
Hut!

1054
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,860
- There you go!
- Yeah!

1055
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,620
- Hey, come on. Stop it. Get back. Get back.
- Good job, Morales.

1056
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,927
I'm gonna take a second.

1057
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,242
- I didn't mean to take you away.
- Oh, we're done.

1058
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:31,380
I didn't know you were coming.

1059
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,005
Yeah, I didn't either.

1060
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,005
You've grown.

1061
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,700
You saw me a month ago.

1062
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,609
I know. I know. But you have.

1063
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:52,925
Jesus.

1064
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:56,442
I don't know how you
get any work done around here.

1065
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,451
I don't.

1066
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,766
So, I'm in a bit of a rough patch here.

1067
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,608
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1068
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,929
It happens.

1069
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,281
I know.

1070
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,050
Good.

1071
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,327
- I need your signature on this.
- Well, what is it?

1072
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:28,283
It's a short... term mortgage...

1073
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,940
on the apartment building
we own together.

1074
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,660
That thing isn't worth
more than 150 grand though.

1075
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,489
It's 210.

1076
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:43,643
Since when do you need to take out
sucker mortgages for 200 grand?

1077
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,683
I'm up against it here.

1078
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,410
Thank you.

1079
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,050
It's good to see your face.

1080
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,850
I love you.

1081
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,682
Fourteen, you gonna
check that tank at D'Amico's?

1082
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:23,521
Yeah.

1083
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:29,367
- Oh, fuck.
- Get out of the fucking truck!

1084
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,526
Who's that?

1085
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,647
Eddy!

1086
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,980
- Kathy.
- Abel?

1087
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,780
What's going on?

1088
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,940
It's 17 Two guys are coming at me.

1089
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:41,485
Where are you?

1090
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,060
Hall Street and Flushing A venue.

1091
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,180
I gotta get out of here. Motherfuckers!

1092
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,567
I'm right here.
I'll see if I can find you.

1093
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,780
Eddy?

1094
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,530
Eddy!

1095
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,921
Abel.

1096
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,166
Abel!

1097
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,300
Hey!

1098
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,925
Abel! That way!

1099
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:55,486
Shit.

1100
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,127
Next stop, 50th Street.

1101
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,242
This is the B train to the Bronx.

1102
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:28,166
B train to the Bronx.
Next stop, 50th Street.

1103
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,926
Next stop, 50th Street.
Doors open on the right.

1104
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,045
Stand clear.

1105
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:17,850
Who hired you?

1106
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,285
Who do you work for?

1107
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:28,000
Hey. Listen to me. Your friend is dead.

1108
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,808
Who hired you?

1109
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,327
Please. Please.

1110
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,121
Please. Please.

1111
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,721
Please. Please.

1112
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,650
Go.

1113
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,325
Get out of here.

1114
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,047
Thank you.

1115
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,809
I don't work for anybody!

1116
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,965
But I sold a load of your fuel
in Far Rockaway last week!

1117
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,330
Hey.

1118
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:08,049
- Jimmy, could you give us a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

1119
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,245
Abel.

1120
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,460
- That was well said last night.
- Thank you.

1121
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,050
What can I do for you?

1122
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,288
I'm just here to collect
that check that you owe me.

1123
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,567
- What check it that?
- The one for $213,000.

1124
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:32,327
That funny?

1125
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,820
- A little.
- Why is that?

1126
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:37,048
'Cause I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

1127
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,980
That's how much has been taken from me
over the last six months.

1128
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:43,242
- I had nothing to do with that.
- No?

1129
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:46,660
Your Far Rockaway facility
bought a load of fuel...

1130
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:48,940
off of one
of my stolen trucks last week.

1131
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,804
That's not possible.

1132
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:57,720
Arnold.

1133
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,220
I was standing on one of my hijacked
trucks a couple weeks ago...

1134
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:06,644
just thinking about the cowards
that have done this...

1135
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,485
when I remembered...

1136
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:15,527
that load was purchased
off a barge from Texas.

1137
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:21,884
Now, as you know,
Texas number four is marked.

1138
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:27,540
Do you have any receipts
over the last year...

1139
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,961
for incoming marked number four?

1140
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:35,642
So I'm guessing
there's at least, what...

1141
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:43,246
4,600 gallons of marked fuel
in your small tank right now.

1142
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:48,165
How much?

1143
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:53,324
I said... 213,000.

1144
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,005
I need a day.

1145
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,820
Okay.

1146
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,810
But I was just buying
the stuff off these guys.

1147
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:07,900
I... I-I only bought a couple loads.

1148
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,685
I don't know who they are.
I would never do that.

1149
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,540
This may ruin me.

1150
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:16,540
My goal was to have you out of business
by the end of next year.

1151
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:18,060
But if you're this fucking desperate...

1152
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:20,481
I imagine it won't even take that long.

1153
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,700
Makes you miss having
your dad around, doesn't it?

1154
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,088
Abel. I wasn't the only person
buying this shit.

1155
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,100
All right, well,
when you find out who else did it...

1156
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,168
you can have them pay the difference.

1157
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,180
But I need the whole lot
by tomorrow morning...

1158
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,124
or you're gonna have the feds
at your doorstep by noon.

1159
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,004
There he is.

1160
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,649
The caped crusader.

1161
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,770
Come on up.

1162
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,044
You all right?

1163
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,650
Yeah.

1164
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:19,020
Thank you for seeing me.

1165
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,610
Of course.

1166
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:25,405
So what is it?

1167
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,885
I need a loan.

1168
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,605
- You don't wanna do that.
- Yeah, no shit.

1169
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,050
But I'm here.

1170
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,084
What are we talking about?

1171
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,770
$600,000.

1172
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,490
Jesus, Abel.

1173
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:58,290
- Abel, that's a problem.
- Yeah.

1174
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,500
But if I don't get it...

1175
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,125
What's my collateral?

1176
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,125
- The terminal.
- Oh, yeah?

1177
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:12,060
Me and how many other people
are gonna be coming after it? No way.

1178
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,286
Peter.

1179
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,284
You'll get your money.

1180
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,940
You know, Abel,
I respect everything that you've done.

1181
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:23,900
And because of it, we haven't come
after you the way that I should have...

1182
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,800
for coming into my service area
and poaching my customers.

1183
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:33,660
You're good at what you do,
probably better than us.

1184
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,380
I accept that.

1185
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:37,050
But this would be different.

1186
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,642
I don't want you to be in this position.

1187
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,491
We are not nice people to borrow
three quarters of a million dollars from.

1188
01:44:48,760 --> 01:44:50,250
I know that.

1189
01:44:55,680 --> 01:44:58,081
You know,
I'm... I'm gonna think about this.

1190
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,002
You know, we should both
think about this.

1191
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,965
Yeah.

1192
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:39,660
What a day.

1193
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,250
Yeah.

1194
01:45:44,520 --> 01:45:46,010
You okay?

1195
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,970
Yeah.

1196
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,924
How's your brother?

1197
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,849
He's good. He's good.

1198
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,020
- The girls up there though...
- Stop.

1199
01:46:03,120 --> 01:46:04,610
Oh!

1200
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:08,540
They didn't have girls like that
where I went to school.

1201
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,165
Shut your mouth.

1202
01:46:12,720 --> 01:46:14,210
How'd it go?

1203
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:18,660
I think we can pull it off.

1204
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:21,100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1205
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:24,090
Three different parties. It's a mess.

1206
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,250
And the terms...

1207
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,660
Peter finally showed me his true colors.

1208
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,285
I'm sorry.

1209
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:37,180
I spent my whole life
trying not to become a gangster.

1210
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,420
I know.

1211
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,763
And now, on the biggest deal
of my career, they're gonna own me.

1212
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,610
- What is this?
- Bank account.

1213
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:15,860
Whose?

1214
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:17,485
Ours.

1215
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,246
Ours?

1216
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:32,780
- How much is in here?
- A lot.

1217
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:36,566
This will help. You replace Peter's money,
get him out of the deal.

1218
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,125
Where did this come from?

1219
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,086
Abel.

1220
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,244
Where did this come from?

1221
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:58,803
I've been skimming money
from the company.

1222
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:05,207
Anna.

1223
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,840
How long?

1224
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:10,700
From the beginning.

1225
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,180
It was just in case times got tough.

1226
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,780
But then it was because you were taking
all these crazy chances.

1227
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:19,690
I didn't know what else to do.
I couldn't risk us being left with nothing.

1228
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,209
What am I supposed to do with this?

1229
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:25,450
Use it.

1230
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,166
- Is it clean?
- I don't know what that means.

1231
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,460
It means that if I were
to walk into the office...

1232
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,245
of the people that are trying
to put us in jail right now...

1233
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:36,740
and if I slap the check
from this account on their desk...

1234
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,780
would it push me deeper into hell?

1235
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:41,300
Or would it help to pull me out?
That's what it means.

1236
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,051
It's as clean as every dollar
we've ever made.

1237
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:48,540
- Well, that's a fucking bullshit answer.
- I can clear it in the books.

1238
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,500
I don't want anything to do with this!

1239
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:52,601
Fine.

1240
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:55,820
You keep it exactly
where it is, all right?

1241
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:59,100
And you use it
when they drag me off to jail.

1242
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,362
So what's the plan here?

1243
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,900
I'm gonna get this done...

1244
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,923
and it's not gonna be as a cheat.

1245
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:10,020
God, you're too much!

1246
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,580
You've been walking around
your whole life...

1247
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,820
like all this happened
'cause of your hard work...

1248
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,900
your good luck, your charm.

1249
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,162
Mr. Fucking American Dream.

1250
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:22,580
It wasn't your good luck
helping you out all these years.

1251
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,220
It was me doing the things
you didn't wanna know about!

1252
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,721
You stole from me!

1253
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:33,420
Abel.

1254
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:35,860
You've been so good in not letting
your ego get in the way...

1255
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,610
when it comes to business.

1256
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:40,688
Don't start now 'cause it's me.

1257
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,140
This is 1010 WINS.

1258
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:58,323
You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

1259
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,740
Good morning. It's 50 degrees.

1260
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,460
Time is 7:15

1261
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:06,780
President Reagan
spoke to the nation last night...

1262
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,962
concerning the state
of our country's economy.

1263
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:12,540
He spoke about Republicans' proposed plans
to cut government spending...

1264
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,140
trim back regulation on business...

1265
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:16,561
and reduce taxes
over the next three years.

1266
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,210
We'll use the money.

1267
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,460
Your money.

1268
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,085
It's the smart play.

1269
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,850
It's our money.

1270
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,090
I know.

1271
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,525
Good morning.

1272
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,681
- You good?
- How are you?

1273
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,570
Pen, please.

1274
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,284
These fucking guys.

1275
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:23,620
What's with the extra 11 thou?

1276
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:26,620
There's some fuel left over
in two of the tanks.

1277
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,529
It was a fair price for it.

1278
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:57,040
Mazel tov.

1279
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1280
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:01,485
Thank you.

1281
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,445
Shalom.

1282
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,050
Congratulations.

1283
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:20,965
Did you know?

1284
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:23,610
About the money?

1285
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:25,965
Yes.

1286
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,620
You should have told me.

1287
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,051
I know.

1288
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,645
I'm sorry.

1289
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,488
Take a look at this.

1290
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:07,846
You know something? I never realized
that we had this view from back here.

1291
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,086
I did.

1292
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,885
It's beautiful.

1293
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:25,565
Abel!

1294
01:53:35,800 --> 01:53:38,371
I thought you said
you threw that in the river.

1295
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,365
Well, I didn't.

1296
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,885
Yeah, I can see that.

1297
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:54,282
I have nowhere to go.

1298
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:58,725
Nowhere easy.

1299
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,321
Fuck you.

1300
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,001
Fuck you.

1301
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,125
I have nothing.

1302
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,850
I have nothing.

1303
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,851
And somehow you've ended up
with everything you wanted.

1304
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,380
It wasn't meant to be.

1305
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,687
What is that supposed to mean?

1306
01:54:25,160 --> 01:54:27,242
I know what you wanted.

1307
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:29,721
I know.

1308
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:33,328
But you have to forget that now.

1309
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,020
You gave me a good chance.

1310
01:54:40,120 --> 01:54:44,921
You gave me a good chance. Correct?

1311
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,241
Yes.

1312
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:52,481
You gave me a better chance
than I deserved.

1313
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,326
Right?

1314
01:54:54,920 --> 01:54:56,081
No.

1315
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,603
You're looking backwards.

1316
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:03,922
Look forwards.
That's the only thing you can control.

1317
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,610
Julian.

1318
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:18,841
Abel!

1319
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:24,245
Please take care of my family.

1320
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:32,165
Call the police.

1321
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:05,084
Mr. Morales.

1322
01:57:07,240 --> 01:57:08,730
I'm very sorry.

1323
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:11,045
You knew him well?

1324
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,980
Yes, I did.

1325
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,242
He must have been under
a hell of a lot of pressure.

1326
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:18,450
Yes, he was.

1327
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:21,729
I'm sorry.

1328
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,980
Well, thank you for coming.

1329
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:28,060
I just wanted to make sure
that all this was handled correctly.

1330
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:29,321
Of course.

1331
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,166
So...

1332
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,762
You should know that I won't be taking
that deal that you offered.

1333
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:43,044
I would never accept felony charges
for anything that we've done.

1334
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:45,611
I know.

1335
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:49,020
I'm not a felon.

1336
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:50,724
That's probably true.

1337
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:56,180
But I also can't have you digging around
in my life for the next 10 years...

1338
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,123
hanging this around my neck.

1339
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:01,043
Look, I love a good battle...

1340
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:04,451
but this is very bad for my business.

1341
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:07,646
So we need to come
to some sort of conclusion.

1342
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:10,284
We can probably do that.

1343
01:58:11,640 --> 01:58:12,846
Good.

1344
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:17,006
So I hear you closed
on this terminal today.

1345
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,700
Yeah, it looks that way.

1346
01:58:19,800 --> 01:58:22,531
I didn't realize this was
what you had in the works.

1347
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:26,371
Yeah. For a very long time.

1348
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,420
This could put you in quite
a powerful position.

1349
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:33,205
I mean, you get this place
up and running...

1350
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,448
it'll have significant influence...

1351
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,525
politically speaking.

1352
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:44,842
We all have our ambitions, Abel.

1353
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,961
And sometimes we need help to get there.

1354
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:54,010
Yes.

1355
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:57,682
You've come a very long way.

1356
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:01,241
In a very short time.

1357
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:03,010
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

1358
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:08,446
But you should know that I have always
taken the path that is most right.

1359
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,883
Most right?

1360
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:14,962
The result is never in question for me.

1361
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,889
Just what path do you take to get there.

1362
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:23,540
And there is always one
that is most right...

1363
01:59:23,640 --> 01:59:25,449
and that is what this is.

1364
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,645
I hope so.

1364
01:59:31,305 --> 02:00:31,564
