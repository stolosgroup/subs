1879 (12TH YEAR OF THE NEW AGE)

3
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:04,106
YOKOHAMA STATION

4
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,980
You'll hurt yourselves!

5
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,441
Rintaro!

6
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,972
Was it you who sold a warship

7
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,725
to Makoto Shishio?

8
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,227
What might this be about?

9
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,605
We are told

10
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,109
a Shanghai arms dealer is on the train.

11
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,070
How rude!

12
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,280
This gentleman represents--

13
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,784
Shouldn't you start
by introducing yourself?

14
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,082
You're Japanese?

15
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,214
You are Goro Fujita, Bureau of Police?

16
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,049
Or

17
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:59,137
is it Hajime Saito,
formerly of the Shogun police?

18
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,769
You want weapons too?
I'll sell you all you want.

19
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,690
Ironclads, Gatling guns, Snider rifles…

20
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,111
Now that the Satsuma Rebellion's over,
I've got lots.

21
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,447
Bring him.

22
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,866
On your feet.

23
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,580
I wouldn't.

24
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,962
Where's Battôsai the Killer?

25
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,757
Why is the Shanghai mafia asking?

26
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:36,967
Does he still have

27
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,303
the scars on his cheek?

28
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,347
What?

29
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:48,854
Well?

30
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,443
Does he still have
the cross of scars on his cheek?

31
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,073
He does, huh?

32
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,160
They're still there?

33
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,874
I guess my sister still hates him.

34
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,675
You want a fight, Shinsengumi?

35
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,720
Halt!

36
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,654
Hold it!

37
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,143
You want me?

38
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,276
I'm all yours.

39
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,287
Take him!

40
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:48,658
ASAKUSA, TOKYO

41
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,959
Sorry.

42
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,004
That bride looks fine!

43
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,130
Good for you!

44
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,424
Will you look at that!

45
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,010
Well!

46
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,767
All these new Western ways.

47
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:20,398
A white kimono would be nice,
but I'd like that dress too.

48
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:24,110
How many weddings
are you planning to have?

49
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,696
I prefer the old hairstyles.

50
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,948
-Why?
-What?

51
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,658
They suit an old head?

52
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,500
Kaoru?

53
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,795
Kaoru! You're staring into space.

54
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,297
She's imagining she's marrying Kenshin.

55
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,092
You're a kid with a big mouth!

56
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,593
Cut it out!

57
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,346
Oh, Kenshin.

58
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,390
It is certainly very beautiful.

59
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,688
Ms. Kaoru?

60
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,233
What's wrong?

61
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,859
Figure it out.

62
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,654
Huh?

63
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,366
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS MINISTRY
BUREAU OF POLICE TRAINING GROUND

64
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,659
Begin!

65
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,920
We've finally started.

66
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,505
Very good.

67
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,282
Mr. Maekawa.

68
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,076
Chief Uramura.

69
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,541
Several men from my dojo
are serving as instructors here.

70
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,168
They are?

71
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,963
It's been 12 years since the Restoration.

72
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,092
These young men have never seen war.

73
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,681
Japan has sent troops to Taiwan
and now to Korea.

74
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,519
We're still arguing with China

75
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,482
over our claim that Okinawa is ours.

76
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,903
There could be war with China at any time.

77
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:45,043
TOKYO POLICE HEADQUARTERS

78
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,301
Thanks for coming out.

79
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,386
You're nothing but trouble.

80
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,348
If you would confirm transfer…

81
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,977
He wants you to confirm the transfer.

82
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,697
Thank you.

83
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,242
Come on.

84
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,605
Why the hell did we free
a Shanghai mafia boss?

85
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,649
We didn't free him.

86
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:56,072
He was released into custody of the consul
under the terms of our treaty.

87
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,243
Why should China judge
a violation of our law?

88
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,495
They have jurisdiction.

89
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,916
It's the same with a Japanese in China.

90
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,295
Enter.

91
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,968
Remember Cho?

92
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,222
One of Shishio's Ten Swords.

93
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,143
He's been working undercover for us.

94
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,022
Thanks for your help back then.

95
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,738
I don't trust turncoats.

96
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,741
Oh, dear!

97
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,451
Don't be like that.

98
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,414
He'll keep an eye on
what Shanghai's doing.

99
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,250
You know the drill.

100
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,099
BEEF HOT POT
AKABEKO

101
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,938
Bring more! This isn't enough.

102
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,148
I'm starving!

103
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,108
Beef! It's been a while.

104
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,151
Right?

105
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,737
Here you are.

106
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,740
Great!

107
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,576
Where were you?

108
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,580
Fencing with the constables
at the Police Dojo.

109
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,374
It's busy here.

110
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,125
Tae works us hard.

111
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,505
Find a boyfriend like Kaoru too,
and I'll give you time off.

112
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,340
Tae, stop it!

113
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,383
Oh?

114
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,468
You stop it too!

115
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,721
Anyway, let's eat.

116
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,727
That's hot!

117
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,062
Why are you shoving it in?

118
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,438
You shut up.

119
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,773
Calm down, Kaoru!

120
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,191
I am calm.

121
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,489
I'm stuffed!

122
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,620
Pig!

123
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:52,123
And you eat too much meat.

124
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,876
Your face is still red.

125
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,962
You shut up. I'm not blushing.

126
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,298
What's wrong?

127
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,135
Nothing. I'm fine.

128
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,183
It's time you got used to peace.

129
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,524
If you would, Kujiranami.

130
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,196
The opening shot of vengeance.

131
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,592
What was that noise?

132
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,817
Move!

133
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,736
Stand aside!

134
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,239
Out of the way!

135
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,701
Move!

136
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,708
Mr. Himura!

137
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,502
What's going on, Chief?

138
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,837
What's up?

139
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,881
Someone fired a cannon into the city!

140
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,759
They hit a beef place called Akabeko.

141
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,386
Akabeko?

142
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,056
It came from Ueno Hill.
We'll surround the area.

143
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,475
They might shoot again.

144
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,102
Be careful.

145
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,150
I'll go with the Chief.
Go check on Akabeko.

146
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,693
-Okay.
-I'll come too!

147
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,694
Come on!

148
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,430
What's going on?

149
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,644
Tae! Tsubame!

150
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,152
Search the area!

151
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,367
Only a shrine tree snapped off.

152
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,287
Not even a trace of a gun mount.

153
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:40,958
They probably used the tree
to stop the recoil.

154
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,504
Even if they did aim and fire from here,

155
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,090
surely, they couldn't hit Akabeko!

156
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,676
Chief!

157
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,304
-Chief!
-Yes?

158
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,806
We found this.

159
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,478
"Man judges"?

160
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,691
It's usually, "Heaven judges."
Don't they even know that?

161
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:07,235
No.

162
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,117
Someone will pass judgment
in Heaven's place.

163
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,332
JUSTIFICATION FOR EXECUTION

164
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,502
The shogunate and the Shinsengumi…

165
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,088
They both justified their killings
that way.

166
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,632
So this means…

167
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,261
I think someone's saying

168
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,973
if Heaven will not judge,

169
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,683
then they will.

170
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,393
I see.

171
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:46,065
So some malcontents are still unhappy
with the new government.

172
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,900
We can't have that.

173
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,987
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir!

174
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,740
-Search every corner of this area!
-Yes, sir!

175
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,746
Anyone in mind?

176
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,748
No.

177
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,837
The man from Shanghai?

178
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,050
He sold Shishio that ship.

179
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,140
He said something.

180
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,393
"Does Battôsai still have his scars?"

181
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:48,461
MAN JUDGES

182
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,921
OGUNI CLINIC

183
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,006
Hey!

184
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,550
More bandages!

185
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,595
We've used everything we had.
I'll get more.

186
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,888
Thanks.

187
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,097
I'm finished here.

188
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,767
-Press down on that wound.
-Yes.

189
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,480
Megumi!

190
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,566
How are you doing?

191
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,109
As best I can.

192
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:13,861
Tae!

193
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,323
Tsubame!

194
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,452
She got burned trying to get people out.

195
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,706
Kaoru and Yahiko just left.

196
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,957
Oh, I see.

197
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,252
What a thing to do!

198
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,751
Ms. Kaoru? Yahiko?

199
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,753
Are you all right?

200
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:17,299
Yes. We were checking on the injured
at Megumi's clinic.

201
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,844
Tsubame and Tae?

202
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:42,074
Anyway, who could have done
something this horrible?

203
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,833
Megumi,

204
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,377
can I ask you something?

205
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,922
What?

206
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,217
Kenshin's scars…

207
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:04,722
They're pretty old. Why don't they fade?

208
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,391
I don't know.

209
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,945
I asked Dr. Oguni about that once.

210
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,323
And?

211
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,077
It was half superstition.

212
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:34,168
He said a scar
inflicted in righteous anger

213
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,714
won't disappear until
that anger is appeased.

214
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,626
You're still up?

215
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,464
Sano…

216
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:27,096
So what's going on
that we don't know about?

217
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,023
Kenshin…

218
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,904
I understand very well

219
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:49,577
that you don't want to worry
Kaoru, Yahiko, and Megumi.

220
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,288
But…

221
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,210
surely you can tell me.

222
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
What's that noise?

223
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,859
Mr. Himura! Open up!

224
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,570
Mr. Himura!

225
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,077
Come quick! The Maekawa Dojo!

226
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,537
What?

227
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:34,955
An attack.

228
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,335
It's a slaughter. The police came,

229
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,795
but they're no match!

230
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,839
-I'll come!
-No.

231
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,970
I'll be back by morning.
Keep the gate shut tight.

232
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,431
You're in charge.

233
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,151
Mr. Himura!

234
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,862
-Mr. Himura!
-What now?

235
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:12,409
Have Chief Uramura put guards at
the Kamiya Dojo and Oguni Clinic.

236
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,454
There's no word from the Chief.

237
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,082
We're going there now.

238
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,417
Kenshin.

239
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:24,588
Leave the Maekawa Dojo to me.
You go to the Chief's.

240
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,881
I thank you.

241
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,427
URAMURA

242
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:42,481
Put that down, or I'll shoot!

243
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,400
Fool!

244
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,486
You think that thing will stop me?

245
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,579
Husband!

246
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,834
Who are you? What do you want?

247
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,051
What the hell's going on?

248
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,186
Okay, who's next?

249
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,783
Damn you!

250
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,579
What do you want?

251
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,093
Oh, relax!

252
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,888
You won't be lonely.

253
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,016
You can all die together.

254
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,684
No! Kill me instead!

255
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,859
Don't hate me for this.

256
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,528
Instead…

257
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,370
Hate me?

258
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,459
Quite enough people hate me already.

259
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,464
Left cheek, crossed scars…

260
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,758
Mr. Himura! Be careful!

261
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,551
So it's you?

262
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,262
Battôsai the Killer?

263
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,681
Perfect.

264
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,236
Tell me…

265
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,615
who's using you for revenge?

266
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,288
A good guy.

267
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:48,542
We used to see
who could kill the most in a night.

268
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,214
It was fun.

269
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,385
So you've led a life of shame too.

270
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,016
We're two of a kind.

271
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,728
If you're after revenge,
I'll fight all you want.

272
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,940
But don't drag others into this.

273
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,320
Mementos of my god-given gift!

274
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,172
Get out!

275
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,858
Hey!

276
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:40,570
Are you alive?

277
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,410
I'm too late!

278
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,790
What happened?

279
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,055
I know what you're thinking.

280
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,645
"Who are these guys?"

281
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,481
"How many of them are there?"

282
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:23,447
"Who's the leader?"
"Where will they attack next?"

283
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,291
Suffer, then.

284
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:38,503
Now

285
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:41,381
man judges.

286
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,071
Mr. Himura!

287
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,658
Why?

288
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,536
Why us?

289
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,750
Why?

290
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,761
What's the matter,

291
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,056
Battôsai?

292
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,737
You look as if
you've seen my sister's ghost?

293
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,881
You…

294
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:49,676
It can't be…

295
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,226
What if it is?

296
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,155
Will you kill me?

297
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,160
Like you did her?

298
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,415
With that filthy sword?

299
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,961
It's been 14 years.

300
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:31,468
I went to Shanghai, nearly died there,
and worked my way up

301
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,722
to the top of the Shanghai mafia.

302
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,808
All the while

303
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,646
planning to come back
and avenge my sister.

304
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,861
Just wait.

305
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,949
Man's judgment is at hand.

306
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,329
The men with me hate you too.

307
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:04,167
And we are capable of anything.

308
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:08,713
Battôsai…

309
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,718
I don't want to simply cause you pain.

310
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,140
I want you to suffer.

311
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,306
Kenshin's here.

312
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,060
What's all this trouble about?

313
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,731
Hey,

314
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,649
Kenshin.

315
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,193
Kenshin!

316
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,159
Welcome back, Kenshin.

317
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,666
I'll get some rest.

318
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,182
Something's not right.

319
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,562
I've never seen him look

320
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,148
so tormented before.

321
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,682
<i>Tokyo is now on high alert.</i>

322
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:30,438
The dojo of fencing instructor Maekawa
was attacked last night.

323
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:35,276
As was the home of Chief Uramura.

324
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,406
Most of the officers
who responded were injured.

325
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,785
We don't know who the attackers were.

326
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,994
However,

327
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,665
this is clearly a challenge
to police authorities.

328
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,459
Our dignity is at stake.

329
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,964
We must preserve public order in Tokyo!

330
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,020
It wasn't easy, but I found them.

331
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,773
Their armory.

332
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,736
They've taken a place in Yokohama.

333
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:24,576
A man named Wu Heixing.
A Shanghai millionaire.

334
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,460
Lack of scruples makes good spies.

335
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,881
Thanks a lot!

336
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,385
I was one of the Ten Swords.

337
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,347
Like I'd really work for the new regime!

338
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,861
After yesterday's events,

339
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:06,993
we have 30 comrades
stationed in the compound.

340
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:12,832
Come in.

341
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,256
It's been a while, boss.

342
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,217
Heixing?

343
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,595
When did you come back from Shanghai?

344
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,725
I was told you're finishing up
what you came to do.

345
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:36,397
I just wanted to make sure
you remembered our deal.

346
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,401
I remember.

347
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:44,781
Once I'm done, the organization is yours.

348
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,867
Arms, opium… Do what you like.

349
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,120
Japan will be yours.

350
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,609
<i>Good news, Tomoe.</i>

351
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:28,491
It's finally time for heaven
to levy judgment on Battôsai.

352
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,123
Enishi… Not you!

353
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,292
You didn't know?

354
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,962
They said they had told you.

355
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,385
Go home, Enishi.

356
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,805
You're our family's son.

357
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,850
-Don't get mixed up in this.
-To hell with the family!

358
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,519
It's you I want to--

359
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,563
Go home, Enishi.

360
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,400
Why?

361
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,616
What happened?

362
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,457
Why protect him?

363
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,918
He's your enemy!

364
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:22,921
He stole your happiness.
You should want revenge!

365
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,082
KAMIYA DOJO

366
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:20,121
Last night after you two went out,

367
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,291
Yahiko said…

368
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,837
he was sick of being weak.

369
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:38,097
In his own way,
he senses that trouble's coming.

370
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,935
He's trying to strengthen himself.

371
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,076
Then I should talk to you all.

372
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,334
Ms. Kaoru, get everyone together.

373
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:22,475
Last night, the Maekawa Dojo
and Chief Uramura's home were attacked.

374
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,981
All to take vengeance on me.

375
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,278
Vengeance on you?

376
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,784
The Akabeko attack too.

377
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,708
They were planned by
a man named Enishi Yukishiro.

378
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,880
Brother to Tomoe Himura…

379
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,218
my wife, who I stabbed to death.

380
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,983
As the shogunate fell…

381
00:44:15,695 --> 00:44:16,696
when…

382
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,993
I got these scars.

383
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,210
Woman, pour us a drink.

384
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:36,674
We're out day and night
risking our lives for the likes of you.

385
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,929
Kyoto's no place for fake patriots.

386
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,892
You're mine!

387
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,238
I thought I'd come out and say thank you.

388
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,202
You really…

389
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,497
make it rain blood.

390
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,215
<i>I'll stay with you…</i>

391
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,594
<i>a while longer.</i>

392
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:48,329
<i>What is happiness?</i>

393
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,500
I feel like living here with you

394
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,711
has answered that question for me.

395
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,133
<i>I was</i>

396
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:06,138
<i>engaged to be married.</i>

397
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,977
Before the wedding

398
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,397
in the unrest in Kyoto,

399
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,942
he made the ultimate sacrifice.

400
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,368
<i>If you want revenge,</i>

401
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:33,124
get close to Battôsai and find out
all you can about him.

402
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:40,089
Find his weak points.

403
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,010
Tomoe…

404
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,848
the happiness you've lost once…

405
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,894
<i>you will never lose again.</i>

406
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,754
<i>April 5th.</i>

407
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:25,968
<i>Before our wedding,</i>
<i>Kiyosato made the ultimate sacrifice.</i>

408
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,815
I can't die!

409
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,153
There's someone I love.

410
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,836
<i>I want to avenge Kiyosato.</i>

411
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,097
Tomoe…

412
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,395
Tomoe…

413
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,075
Tomoe…

414
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,790
You're angry too.

415
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,169
Are you all right?

416
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,010
This is the first you've heard
about this Tomoe person.

417
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,142
Yes.

418
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:50,477
It's a surprise.

419
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,233
But…

420
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,571
I feel sorry for her somehow.

421
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:10,122
Perhaps she was very pure of heart.

422
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,628
She hated herself for falling for

423
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,132
the man who'd killed her first love.

424
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:25,596
And so…

425
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,351
maybe she meant for him to stab her.

426
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,113
I'm sure…

427
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:47,701
Kenshin will never forget Tomoe.

428
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,498
To love someone like that…

429
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,377
so deeply…

430
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,092
and…

431
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:10,098
have her die by your hand.

432
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,107
You'd never forget that.

433
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,455
But

434
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,167
you and Kenshin are alive.

435
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:48,178
If you're alive, you can move on together.

436
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:54,768
Now that Tomoe's dead,
that's one thing she can't do.

437
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,114
Go on. Go to him.

438
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,370
Kenshin.

439
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,918
Ms. Kaoru…

440
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,091
I know you hate troubling people.

441
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,596
I thought you might vanish again.

442
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:33,951
Thank you.

443
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,812
One gem after another!

444
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,692
Well!

445
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:11,947
A <i>wo-dao </i>Chinese sword!
I've never seen one before.

446
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:24,376
What? I'm busy here.

447
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,880
You, huh?

448
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,136
The sword thief who lost to Battôsai
and switched sides?

449
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,179
Sword hunter!

450
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,478
Whatever.

451
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:50,527
I sent the police to the wrong place,
just like that Chinese guy Wu said to.

452
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,822
That deserves some reward.

453
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,492
This is a great sword.

454
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,286
It could hurt you.

455
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,998
The balance is different
than Japanese swords.

456
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,596
You seem sure of yourself.

457
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,642
Do you hate Battôsai too?

458
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,945
All of a sudden,

459
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:36,865
I want to test this blade.

460
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,835
KAMIYA DOJO

461
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,464
Thank you for your efforts this past year.

462
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,966
-Thank you, master.
-Thank you, master.

463
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,390
Dismissed!

464
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,391
<i>-Yes!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

465
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,273
Take a break, and then we clean!

466
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,483
-Yes!
-Yes!

467
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,942
<i>Now,</i>

468
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,570
man judges.

469
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,029
Why?

470
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,657
<i>Why us?</i>

471
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:03,618
MAN JUDGES

472
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,847
Hello!

473
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,061
Howdy!

474
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,688
Misao!

475
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,647
How are you?

476
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:36,109
What are you doing here?
Did you come from Kyoto?

477
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,737
It took so long!

478
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,947
Tokyo's so far away!

479
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,575
Of course it is. Did you come alone?

480
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,913
Aoshi too?

481
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,458
Is Himura here?

482
01:02:04,387 --> 01:02:07,057
So what brings you here anyway?

483
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:11,770
The Suikoji Temple priest

484
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:16,358
heard from his late father that Himura
had something to do with Elder's death.

485
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:22,280
The father apparently knew Himura.

486
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,785
Imagine that.

487
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:32,123
Battôsai fighting alongside
the Shogun's Hidden Watchers!

488
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,210
Fate works in strange ways.

489
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:40,173
Himura is living quietly in Tokyo now.

490
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,467
I see.

491
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:48,640
If you have the chance,
could you take him a message?

492
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:57,065
My father had his late wife's diary,
and I'd like to return it.

493
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,571
He often spoke with my father

494
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,701
about how one who had killed so many

495
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,413
should then lead his life.

496
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,667
Or even if he still should live.

497
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,016
Here.

498
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,526
This is Tomoe's diary?

499
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,239
You knew about her?

500
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,285
Did you read it?

501
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,038
I couldn't do that!

502
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,792
I'm sure it's important to Himura,
so I brought it.

503
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:43,505
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH

504
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,134
<i>The Watchers told me</i>

505
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,303
something interesting.

506
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,682
They said in December,
Tokyo will rain blood.

507
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:59,396
And Battôsai will be the cause.

508
01:05:54,784 --> 01:06:01,499

01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,011
Squad 2, around to the left.

510
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,680
Squad 3, secure the back door.

511
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:17,474
We charge in.

512
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,184
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

513
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,456
It's a damn trap!

514
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,997
This should buy us some time.

515
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,362
What's this? A newspaper extra?

516
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:39,741
What is it?

517
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,246
MAN JUDGES

518
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,671
What's that?

519
01:08:54,422 --> 01:08:55,590
Look!

520
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,674
What's that noise?

521
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:40,093
The same as before.

522
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:49,936
Captain Aoshi!

523
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,105
I have to go!

524
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,765
Let the festival begin!

525
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,557
Take us down.

526
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,537
Follow that.

527
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,206
Do whatever you have to.

528
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,999
Understood.

529
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,888
Man's judgment is at hand.

530
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:52,475
The men with me hate you too.

531
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:57,271
And we are capable of anything.

532
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,400
Battôsai…

533
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,988
I don't want to simply cause you pain.

534
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,824
<i>I want you to suffer.</i>

535
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:16,249
Are you all right?

536
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,459
Thank you!

537
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,168
Hurry!

538
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,300
Is Battôsai here?

539
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,262
This is for him!

540
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,361
Go.

541
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:29,655
Upstairs! Hurry!

542
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:30,990
Thank you!

543
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,993
Who are you?

544
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,163
Evil powers

545
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:41,208
will bury evil-doers in darkness.

546
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:47,131
As the last captain
of the Hidden Watchers,

547
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:49,967
that is my task.

548
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,577
Whoever you are,

549
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:20,915
you don't get in the way of Mumyoi!

550
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,585
Don't just stand there!

551
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:26,420
You too!

552
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:38,933
Who are you?

553
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:47,525
Is it you?

554
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,238
Kenshin's brother-in-law?

555
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,162
Well, he's not here.

556
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,288
But

557
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:06,836
if you've come looking for a fight,
I'll give you one.

558
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,132
You will, huh?

559
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:16,762
Big talk from tiny glasses!

560
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:40,661
Captain Aoshi!

561
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,755
Captain Aoshi!

562
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,632
It's Battôsai we want!

563
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,888
Not you!

564
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,201
Sanosuke!

565
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,917
Guys, when you're in a fight,

566
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,502
you use your head!

567
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,887
Captain Aoshi!

568
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:32,898
Captain Aoshi…

569
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,488
Captain Aoshi!

570
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,198
Captain Aoshi!

571
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:45,161
Captain Aoshi!

572
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:49,623
He shielded me.

573
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:51,542
Are you all right?

574
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,379
Thank you!

575
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,882
Captain Aoshi!

576
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,178
Captain Aoshi!

577
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,514
Damn it!

578
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:42,426
Wait, Battôsai!

579
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,557
Finish me off.

580
01:18:56,148 --> 01:19:00,527
To restore the Emperor,

581
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:04,198
you stole our samurai pride.

582
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,825
You denied us…

583
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,497
an honorable death.

584
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:17,878
So now…

585
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,383
with those hands…

586
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:28,138
give me that now!

587
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,856
That much

588
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:42,152
you owe me!

589
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,039
Run me through!

590
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,267
I'm sorry.

591
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,440
I have sworn that with this blade,

592
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,526
I will never kill again.

593
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,323
Live in the new age.

594
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:32,077
Freeze!

595
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:35,164
Then at least cut off this arm!

596
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,791
Come quietly!

597
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,711
Because if I still have it…

598
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,881
Battôsai!

599
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,428
Battôsai!

600
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,473
Kill me! Please!

601
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,383
Sano!

602
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,100
Ken…

603
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,271
Kaoru…

604
01:21:44,942 --> 01:21:46,110
Sorry.

605
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,738
I'm sorry!

606
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,074
He took Kaoru.

607
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:56,829
I couldn't stop him.

608
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:00,374
I couldn't do anything…

609
01:22:03,127 --> 01:22:04,378
but watch.

610
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,909
Now you look good.

611
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:45,419
Hold it!

612
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,673
Keep your hands off her!

613
01:22:55,512 --> 01:22:56,972
Don't worry.

614
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:16,950
Yahiko!

615
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,842
"The heart to live in authentic truth"?

616
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:36,929
That's dumb.

617
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:49,233
Are you Enishi Yukishiro?

618
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:52,194
So what if I am?

619
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,491
Killing Kenshin or me
won't bring Tomoe back.

620
01:23:58,075 --> 01:23:59,701
You just lose your soul…

621
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,622
a prisoner of your rage.

622
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,499
How do you know her?

623
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,676
Did you hear that…

624
01:24:18,762 --> 01:24:20,430
from Battôsai?

625
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:23,892
My sister's name?

626
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:06,078
<i>Here, I shall levy man's judgment.</i>

627
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:13,849
There's no escape.

628
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:20,063
Man's judgment requires your death.

629
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:23,817
Tomoe would not have wanted this.

630
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:24,734
Silence.

631
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,029
How would you know?

632
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:30,532
Die!

633
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:32,868
Die!

634
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,914
You don't speak for her.

635
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:39,624
Die!

636
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:42,502
Die!

637
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,422
Die!

638
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,553
Die!

639
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,668
Why?

640
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,345
Why do you look so sad?

641
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,688
Why won't you smile?

642
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:52,048
TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH

643
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,514
<i>The man I met</i>

644
01:32:00,598 --> 01:32:02,392
is a wanderer named Kenshin.

645
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:05,311
Wandering is the easy way out.

646
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:08,606
To help you out, why else?

647
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:12,318
That sword is for you.

648
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:17,574
Your life does not belong only to you.

649
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:22,078
Worry about your own life
before someone else's.

650
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,956
<i>I must not let him die now.</i>

651
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,876
I will preserve him

652
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,837
though it means my life.

653
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:56,780
Kenshin!

654
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:07,457
Are you going?

655
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:11,419
Yahiko…

656
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:17,050
look after Sano.

657
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:43,910
The first one to find him kills him.

658
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:47,455
All right?

659
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,209
Suit yourself.

660
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,754
Come on.

661
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,013
You called?

662
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,601
It's a bit soon,

663
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,522
but the organization is yours.

664
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:15,859
Why is that?

665
01:34:15,942 --> 01:34:18,069
My private war is almost over.

666
01:34:22,532 --> 01:34:26,619
It's not as easy as that, boss.

667
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:32,458
The Japanese police
have gotten wind of this place.

668
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:37,297
If you lose and they take you in again,
our government won't be--

669
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,214
Heixing!

670
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,306
What did you say?

671
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,519
Do you think I might lose?

672
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,438
No, never.

673
01:34:58,568 --> 01:34:59,819
Get out of here.

674
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:03,114
One more word, and I'll kill you too!

675
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,552
Are you turning tail?

676
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:25,511
Shut up!

677
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:29,849
We'll kill Battôsai,
and then Yukishiro too.

678
01:35:31,100 --> 01:35:32,185
Mr. Wu…

679
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,275
Thank you for your help in Kyoto.

680
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,404
I understand you might have
some work for me.

681
01:35:58,211 --> 01:36:00,088
You! Halt!

682
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,507
Halt!

683
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:19,607
So you're Battôsai?

684
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:21,859
We've been waiting.

685
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:45,420
Himura!

686
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,964
Don't go keeping this to yourself!

687
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,592
Ms. Misao!

688
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:56,472
For Aoshi Shinomori,
Captain of the Edo Hidden Watchers,

689
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:59,892
Misao Makimachi stands with you!

690
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:12,488
This is my job.

691
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,617
Kenshin!

692
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,535
Sano?

693
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:19,537
Out of the way!

694
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:38,723
Kenshin, go!

695
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,517
Go, Himura!

696
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:57,158
Go!

697
01:40:23,768 --> 01:40:24,936
Damn it!

698
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,771
Go around!

699
01:40:42,828 --> 01:40:45,248
I don't have time to play now.

700
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:47,500
"Play"?

701
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:49,210
How dare you!

702
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:53,130
I hold the trump card here!

703
01:40:56,425 --> 01:41:00,972
The greatest of the Ten Swords
assassins, Sojiro Seta!

704
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:03,808
Do your worst!

705
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:05,935
You!

706
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:10,731
It's been a while, Mr. Himura.

707
01:41:29,542 --> 01:41:31,836
Hey! What are you doing?

708
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:34,880
I became a wanderer too.

709
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:39,093
After Mr. Himura beat me,
my life lost meaning.

710
01:41:42,388 --> 01:41:44,515
It's been a while since I drew a sword,

711
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:47,518
but I'm probably better than you.

712
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,939
Get them! Kill them both!

713
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,153
That was fun.

714
01:44:03,696 --> 01:44:08,200
It's nice not having to worry about
your back for a change.

715
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:22,757
Go on ahead, Mr. Himura.

716
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,217
And show me

717
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:31,807
how that sword cuts old hatreds
and frees those trapped in the past.

718
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:35,728
I thank you.

719
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:19,939
Come on.

720
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:40,686
So you're here…

721
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:44,690
Battôsai.

722
01:46:47,776 --> 01:46:48,944
Sorry to keep you.

723
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:53,741
Where's Ms. Kaoru?

724
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:55,784
Indeed…

725
01:46:57,786 --> 01:46:58,871
I wonder.

726
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:03,918
Enishi,

727
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:12,051
it's perfectly natural
you'd want to avenge your sister.

728
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:16,388
But stop pulling other people into it.

729
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:20,059
Your enemy is me alone.

730
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:22,519
I alone bear the guilt.

731
01:47:22,603 --> 01:47:23,562
Shut up!

732
01:47:25,314 --> 01:47:28,150
It's not you alone. It's all of you.

733
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:33,656
Your friends, everyone you talk to,

734
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:37,660
and all of this shit country you've made!

735
01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:50,005
Tomoe…

736
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:54,510
the time has come at last.

737
01:48:18,075 --> 01:48:21,787
Man's judgment is at hand.

738
01:51:08,579 --> 01:51:09,997
Well, Battôsai?

739
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:15,043
Does your wound hurt like my sister's?

740
01:51:23,218 --> 01:51:27,931
I'm damn sure it doesn't!

741
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:19,024
Die!

742
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:31,828
Only death can repay the sin of murder.

743
01:52:32,412 --> 01:52:36,750
Writhe in agony,
and die in regret and despair!

744
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:39,628
That is the only way you can atone!

745
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:48,887
Stand up!

746
01:52:51,974 --> 01:52:53,767
This does not

747
01:52:55,102 --> 01:52:57,604
atone for your crime.

748
01:53:01,733 --> 01:53:03,527
Stand up, Battôsai!

749
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,629
What's wrong?

750
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:26,883
Can't take any more?

751
01:53:30,345 --> 01:53:31,888
Then kill yourself.

752
01:53:34,474 --> 01:53:38,520
Turn that phony back-blade on yourself

753
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,481
and die.

754
01:53:51,783 --> 01:53:52,951
Bastard.

755
01:53:55,120 --> 01:54:00,417
You kill more than you can count,
and you're afraid to kill yourself?

756
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:08,759
Battôsai!

757
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:16,350
I've thought about death many times.

758
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:23,690
But I knew my death
would never atone for my sins.

759
01:54:25,984 --> 01:54:27,444
Quit your babbling.

760
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,782
I still have no idea…

761
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,204
how to atone.

762
01:54:44,378 --> 01:54:45,629
But now…

763
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:51,676
for my friends…

764
01:54:55,847 --> 01:54:58,975
and for the peace that Tomoe wanted…

765
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:05,690
Enishi…

766
01:55:08,402 --> 01:55:09,861
I have to stop you.

767
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:27,838
Enishi…

768
01:55:30,132 --> 01:55:32,092
do you see Tomoe…

769
01:55:34,845 --> 01:55:36,513
smiling now?

770
01:57:15,779 --> 01:57:18,657
How could my sister fall for you?

771
01:57:52,274 --> 01:57:55,193
Your feelings for her are not wrong.

772
01:57:57,362 --> 01:58:00,198
Nor is your hatred for me.

773
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:04,744
But the way you are living

774
01:58:06,121 --> 01:58:08,081
is very wrong.

775
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:14,546
End this.

776
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:49,664
Tomoe…

777
01:59:05,055 --> 01:59:06,181
Tomoe…

778
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:29,079
Battôsai!

779
01:59:43,927 --> 01:59:45,011
Damn you!

780
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:54,688
Enishi…

781
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:00,652
I'm sorry.

782
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:18,378
You think I'm some kind of joke!

783
02:00:19,087 --> 02:00:20,255
I'll kill you!

784
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:21,548
-All of you!
-No!

785
02:00:26,928 --> 02:00:28,179
Keep out of my way.

786
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:45,238
Bastard!

787
02:00:47,782 --> 02:00:48,742
Heixing!

788
02:00:52,412 --> 02:00:54,414
Don't get in my way!

789
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:03,673
No!

790
02:01:04,674 --> 02:01:05,759
Stop!

791
02:01:06,342 --> 02:01:08,928
You'll kill him!

792
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:11,055
You will!

793
02:01:21,441 --> 02:01:23,485
Thank you for protecting…

794
02:01:25,612 --> 02:01:26,738
Ms. Kaoru.

795
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:37,832
No…

796
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:42,295
No!

797
02:01:42,378 --> 02:01:43,379
Kenshin.

798
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,717
I wanted to protect…

799
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:55,517
The one I wanted to protect…

800
02:03:02,083 --> 02:03:03,251
Tomoe!

801
02:03:07,171 --> 02:03:09,173
Damn it!

802
02:03:13,177 --> 02:03:14,512
Damn it!

803
02:04:25,249 --> 02:04:26,334
Enishi Yukishiro,

804
02:04:27,335 --> 02:04:28,586
this came for you.

805
02:04:32,799 --> 02:04:37,053
TO ENISHI YUKISHIRO
APPROVED BY CENSOR

806
02:04:49,357 --> 02:04:53,611
THIS DIARY SHOULD BE WITH YOU

807
02:04:53,695 --> 02:04:58,074
FOR YOUR SISTER'S SAKE,
I PRAY THAT YOU WILL LIVE

808
02:05:06,666 --> 02:05:10,086
KAORU KAMIYA

809
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:53,463
<i>He is the man who robbed me</i>
<i>of my happiness</i>

810
02:05:55,006 --> 02:05:59,719
<i>and the man who brought me happiness anew.</i>

811
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:05,892
<i>He will kill again.</i>

812
02:06:07,185 --> 02:06:10,271
<i>But after all his killing is done,</i>

813
02:06:11,314 --> 02:06:16,486
<i>I am sure he will preserve</i>
<i>many more than he has killed.</i>

814
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:23,326
<i>I must not let him die now.</i>

815
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:51,687
<i>I will preserve him…</i>

816
02:06:53,648 --> 02:06:55,316
<i>though it means my life.</i>

817
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:10,540
I WILL PRESERVE HIM
THOUGH IT MEANS MY LIFE

818
02:08:09,807 --> 02:08:10,766
-Ten!
-Ten!

819
02:08:12,393 --> 02:08:13,227
-One!
-One!

820
02:08:14,729 --> 02:08:15,730
-Two!
-Two!

821
02:08:17,106 --> 02:08:18,107
-Three!
-Three!

822
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:19,734
THE HEART TO LIVE IN AUTHENTIC TRUTH

823
02:08:19,817 --> 02:08:20,776
-Four!
-Four!

824
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:23,196
-Five!
-Five!

825
02:08:24,655 --> 02:08:25,615
-Six!
-Six!

826
02:08:39,503 --> 02:08:41,130
Don't overdo it.

827
02:08:41,714 --> 02:08:43,424
Be quiet.

828
02:08:47,762 --> 02:08:49,096
That hurt!

829
02:08:53,434 --> 02:08:54,769
Don't overdo it.

830
02:09:23,172 --> 02:09:24,715
What did you tell Tomoe?

831
02:09:28,427 --> 02:09:30,429
Thank you, I guess.

832
02:09:33,766 --> 02:09:37,019
In the end, Enishi saved me.

833
02:09:40,106 --> 02:09:41,857
But now I think maybe

834
02:09:43,651 --> 02:09:46,320
it was Tomoe watching over me.

835
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:52,994
Enishi Yukishiro…

836
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:57,581
I wonder how he's doing.

837
02:10:01,544 --> 02:10:04,088
He will have to atone as well.

838
02:10:09,677 --> 02:10:11,095
Not with his death,

839
02:10:12,888 --> 02:10:14,390
but with his life.

840
02:10:16,726 --> 02:10:18,060
Until he does that…

841
02:10:20,563 --> 02:10:23,357
the Tomoe in his mind will not smile.

842
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:52,470
Kenshin…

843
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:57,558
what did you say to Tomoe?

844
02:11:01,979 --> 02:11:04,023
The same as you.

845
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:07,401
Thank you.

846
02:11:10,363 --> 02:11:11,572
And

847
02:11:13,032 --> 02:11:14,617
I'm sorry, and…

848
02:11:21,332 --> 02:11:22,500
goodbye.

849
02:17:18,856 --> 02:17:21,692
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED
