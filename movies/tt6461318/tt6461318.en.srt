3
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:22,441
Attention, all inmates,

4
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:23,808
this is your warden speaking.

5
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:25,177
As a result of an
incident that took place

6
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,911
in the dining hall
yesterday evening,

7
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,348
breakfast packs will be
served in your housing units.

8
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:34,919
Yeah, there he is!

9
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:39,724
Hey.

10
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:41,626
Yeah!

11
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,229
Come here.

12
00:02:16,128 --> 00:02:18,364
Woo!

13
00:02:30,008 --> 00:02:32,311
You wanna have
fun tonight, Wayland?

14
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:38,417
Woo!

15
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:05,477
Hey, old man!

16
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,583
Come on, brother.

17
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:11,950
You scared the shit out of me!

18
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,336
Alright, big boy.

19
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,504
I hope you enjoyed that.

20
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:35,074
That'll be the last time
you ride bitch on my bike.

21
00:03:38,444 --> 00:03:42,681
Whoa.

22
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,185
I was expectin' you yesterday.

23
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,820
Easy preacher, he was just
making up for lost time,

24
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:50,256
that's all.

25
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:51,990
You don't get 15 years back
in one night,

26
00:03:52,124 --> 00:03:54,159
Mr. Beckett.

27
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:01,833
Excuse me.

28
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:04,203
Good luck, brother!

29
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:05,870
You get free room and board

30
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,073
in exchange for three
hours of chores a day.

31
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,575
The rest of the time,

32
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,377
I want you lookin' for
work and long-term housing.

33
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,480
Oh, there's some free
clothes on the rack upstairs.

34
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,615
Curfew's 10PM.

35
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:17,716
No drugs or alcohol

36
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,685
on the premises.

37
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,888
That'll get you kicked out,
understood?

38
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,125
Yeah.

39
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:29,827
Okay, good. What
about your club mates?

40
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:30,928
They're my family.

41
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,464
And they're trouble.

42
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,668
Alright, look there.

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,169
Blue one opens the front door.

44
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:39,471
You'll have to
jiggle it a little.

45
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:40,905
Green one's your room key.

46
00:04:43,975 --> 00:04:46,679
It's gonna feel
strange at first.

47
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,180
Just give it time.

48
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:49,782
You know I don't
believe in God, right?

49
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,419
That's okay.

50
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:54,720
It's okay?

51
00:04:54,852 --> 00:04:58,390
Just stay outta
jail, that's all.

52
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:39,164
Morning.

53
00:05:47,406 --> 00:05:48,474
That
be all for you?

54
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:49,575
Yeah.

55
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:52,277
Is Nils still
runnin' the place?

56
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:54,580
No, he sold up and went
into assisted living.

57
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,150
So you own it now?

58
00:05:58,283 --> 00:05:59,884
Yeah, me and my better half.

59
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:00,952
She was always
sitting on this dream

60
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:02,287
of movin' out into the country.

61
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,423
This place came on the market,

62
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:05,824
so we thought "Fuck it!"

63
00:06:05,957 --> 00:06:07,992
That'll be $29.95.

64
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,232
You just got out?

65
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:15,801
Yeah.

66
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,302
You need work,

67
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:18,936
I hear Mr. Thrifty's
hiring down in Mill City.

68
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,040
- Keep the change.
- Have a good day.

69
00:06:32,317 --> 00:06:34,686
What you got goin'
on here tonight?

70
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,288
Self-help group for preachers?

71
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:40,626
It's our Single
Moms Program, actually.

72
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,129
They come to parenting class,
we help them with their rent.

73
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,230
Yeah, you church folks

74
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:46,765
just love stickin' your noses

75
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:48,400
in other people's business

76
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,068
and tellin' 'em it smells bad.

77
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,303
Well, if that's true,

78
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:54,173
then you had me at
the first whiff!

79
00:06:54,306 --> 00:06:56,074
You know, the problem
with do-gooders is

80
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,143
nobody likes 'em.

81
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:00,846
I never gave a shit
about being liked.

82
00:07:00,978 --> 00:07:04,149
I just think people deserve
a second chance, that's all.

83
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,151
Maybe three or four!

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,056
I make my own chances.

85
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,709
I think we're
just waiting on one more,

86
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,611
and here she is.

87
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:36,648
Sorry.

88
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:38,383
It's okay.

89
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:41,620
Alright, everyone, I want
you to close your eyes

90
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:45,591
and take a deep breath.

91
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:47,693
Now put your hand
over your heart.

92
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,995
How's it feeling today?

93
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,564
Dolores, let's start with you.

94
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,970
Can
we start somewhere else?

95
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:02,508
Alright, I'll
tell you how mine's feeling.

96
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:04,877
Slow and steady.

97
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:08,247
I think that's a good
way for a heart to feel.

98
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,751
Anyone else?

99
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,424
- I'm gonna use the restroom.
- Okay.

100
00:08:19,558 --> 00:08:22,094
It's hard to put words to
it sometimes, isn't it?

101
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,133
Holy fuck!

102
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:31,036
I can't believe it.

103
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:32,371
Wow!

104
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,574
When did you get out?

105
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,276
Last week.

106
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,878
You still look like you.

107
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:41,046
You haven't changed.

108
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,381
Yeah, same.

109
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,417
You look exactly the same.

110
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:49,321
Exceptwhat,
you're a mom now?

111
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:53,859
Yep.

112
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,661
You were still in high
school when we were...

113
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:57,329
I know, right?

114
00:08:57,462 --> 00:08:58,764
We were just kids.

115
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:02,801
How ya been?

116
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:06,371
I'm goodgood.

117
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,606
Yeah.

118
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,541
How are you?

119
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,742
Ups and downs.

120
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:13,478
Yeah, I mean, same.

121
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:15,447
Is your grandma
still around or

122
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,783
No, sheshe passed like

123
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,986
- seven or eight years ago.
- Oh fuck, I'm sorry.

124
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,321
It's okay.

125
00:09:22,454 --> 00:09:25,058
I was sad to hear
about your momma.

126
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,692
Yeah.

127
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:33,765
Do you

128
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,203
I mean, I could pick
you up after class.

129
00:09:38,337 --> 00:09:39,671
Like high school?

130
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:41,807
Yeah. But I-I don't
have my hog anymore.

131
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,176
Well, no hog, then
don't fuckin' show up.

132
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:46,511
I was just kidding!

133
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:52,951
I'm gonna be done in,
like, an hour?

134
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:54,953
I'll be here.

135
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,089
It's good to see you, Way.

136
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:00,559
So, what's
the key to self-control?

137
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:02,427
Self-care.

138
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,996
And when there's
no time for self-care, you

139
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,631
Make time.

140
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:07,733
Very good. Thank
you everyone for coming.

141
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,102
I'll see you next week.

142
00:10:10,936 --> 00:10:13,039
Oh, uh, Dolores, food box.

143
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:14,439
Sorry.

144
00:10:17,076 --> 00:10:18,176
Thank you!

145
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,645
You're welcome!

146
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,793
Oh, yes!

147
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,872
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

148
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,206
Do you still drink?

149
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,708
Fuck yeah, I do.

150
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,045
Roadhouse?

151
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:57,716
Sounds good, but I already
spent all my gate money.

152
00:11:00,218 --> 00:11:01,586
Well, let me buy you a drink.

153
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,221
You sure?

154
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,923
Just get in the car.

155
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:09,828
Oh, just throw
that in the back.

156
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:15,200
I'm sorry, hold on,
okay.

157
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:28,613
Thanks.

158
00:11:30,348 --> 00:11:31,249
Thank you.

159
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:32,584
You're welcome.

160
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,488
Cheers.

161
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:39,691
Oh, shit!
Sorry!

162
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,827
To old times.

163
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:44,963
Mmm.

164
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,435
- I wrote you.
- I know.

165
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:51,703
- Okay.
- No, I know.

166
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:53,039
I know you did.

167
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,907
I'm not sayin' you shoulda
wrote back or whatever.

168
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:59,978
I justI wanted to make sure
that you knew, that's all.

169
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:01,980
I wanted to write you back.

170
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,852
I justI got-I
got pregnant and

171
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:11,857
Wait, uh, you got pregnant?

172
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,094
Yeah.

173
00:12:15,228 --> 00:12:16,762
Was it mine?

174
00:12:16,895 --> 00:12:18,296
- No!
- Okay!

175
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,267
- I was just checkin'.
- It was

176
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,072
That was after, soyeah.

177
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:30,442
So, you got, like, a
15-year-old kid or somethin'?

178
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:32,978
Yeah.

179
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:34,613
You were 15 when
we started datin'.

180
00:12:36,448 --> 00:12:40,452
I was.

181
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,787
Time flies.

182
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,656
Not when you're in prison.

183
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,295
No, I guess not.

184
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,601
Who's the father?

185
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:01,907
Nobody.

186
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:07,280
No, c'mon, who was it?

187
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,515
It's me! You can tell me.

188
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:16,055
Uh, I mean, it was after

189
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:20,293
you lost your appeal,
and I was drinkin'

190
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,627
and hustlin' for
attention, and I

191
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,231
I mean, honestly, I couldn't
even tell you his name.

192
00:13:25,363 --> 00:13:26,731
But you decided
to keep it anyway?

193
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,633
Yeah, I thought it
would be a fresh start.

194
00:13:30,569 --> 00:13:33,239
Hmm.

195
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,673
I got two more.

196
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:37,143
Two more what?

197
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,444
Kids. I have three total.

198
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:43,149
You been busy.

199
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:44,649
Yep!

200
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:53,192
There's no father on the scene.

201
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:54,492
It's just us, so

202
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,827
What about swimmin'?

203
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,997
What about swimmin'?

204
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,766
Well, you used to wanna join
the Olympics or whatever.

205
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,435
Oh, I didn't even
make it to Nationals.

206
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:04,936
It was, uh

207
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:07,372
They kicked me off the team
'cos I was showin', so

208
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:10,209
Showin'? Showin' what?

209
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:11,210
The baby.

210
00:14:11,344 --> 00:14:12,278
Oh.

211
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:19,017
Do you want another?

212
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,018
- A beer?
- Yeah.

213
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,386
Yeah, that'd be great.

214
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,727
It's all I got.

215
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,429
That's okay, I don't
need another drink.

216
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:32,464
- Thank you.
- You know what?

217
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:33,832
I'm feelin' lucky tonight.

218
00:14:33,965 --> 00:14:35,368
What are
you talkin' about?

219
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,434
Don't do it, nobody
ever wins those!

220
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:41,340
- Yeah, see!
- Nearly.

221
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:42,841
Nope.

222
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:47,246
Ah! We did it!

223
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:51,583
Told you we'd win!
I told you! Here!

224
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,719
Hey, Adam!

225
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,255
- Yeah?
- Can we have two more?

226
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:57,589
Just a second.

227
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:01,127
Lucky charm!

228
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,062
Psh. Where?

229
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,464
You!

230
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,134
Right here.

231
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:11,569
I don't know 'bout that.

232
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:51,410
We were just

233
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,112
trying to get to a
motel before dark.

234
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,946
You said those
things turned your car over.

235
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,481
Do you think we can get it back
on its wheels and drive it?

236
00:15:56,614 --> 00:15:59,251
Hey, babe.
The kids asleep?

237
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:00,419
Yeah.

238
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:01,853
You know how I feel

239
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:03,456
about that ass juice
in the house, please!

240
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:05,590
Yeah, and
you know how I feel

241
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:06,992
about them cancer sticks.

242
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,693
I'm workin' on it.

243
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,495
You're gonna
carry that child a mile,

244
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:11,896
through that army
of things out there?

245
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,999
I can carry the kid.

246
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,968
What's wrong with her,
how did she get hurt?

247
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,970
One of
those things grabbed her.

248
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,240
You remember
our last time?

249
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,210
By the falls.

250
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,482
Your skin was all
bumpy from the cold.

251
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,751
Well, it's because I
forgot that fuckin' blanket.

252
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:35,887
But you kept me warm.

253
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,758
You'd just gotten "Wayland"
tattooed on your ass.

254
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,626
- No.
- Hmm?.

255
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,661
That was another time.

256
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:44,929
- You sure?
- Yeah.

257
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:46,499
I coulda sworn
it was that time.

258
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,999
No, that was

259
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,036
I got inked in Seaside,
when we went to the ocean.

260
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:54,106
Oh, shit.

261
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,807
I forgot about that.

262
00:16:57,876 --> 00:16:59,811
How could you forget
about seeing the ocean

263
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:00,779
for the first time?

264
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:02,747
Hmm. I didn't forget, I

265
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:05,850
I remember it now.

266
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,022
You had just
gotten your Harley.

267
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,060
And

268
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,628
I couldn't get you to
come in the water with me.

269
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,864
Yeah. 'Cos you
were like a fish,

270
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,900
divin' in and out of the waves.

271
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:30,008
I never been back to
the ocean, you know.

272
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:33,312
Not since.

273
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,581
Never even left the state.

274
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,621
You still got my
name on your ass?

275
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:48,760
Why don't you
look and find out?

276
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:03,741
So many times, I

277
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:09,215
thought about inkin' over it,
but I never did.

278
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,303
I don't even know
how to do this anymore.

279
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,842
C'mon, don't fuck with me.

280
00:18:40,346 --> 00:18:42,881
You sure you didn't
fool around in prison?

281
00:18:44,716 --> 00:18:45,917
Nope.

282
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,820
It's just a lot.

283
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:05,271
I'm just kiddin'.

284
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,302
What's your name?

285
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:39,505
Denim Blue, but
everybody calls me Denim.

286
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:41,240
Nice to meet you, Denim.

287
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:45,944
I'mI'm a friend
of your mom's.

288
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,447
I'm supposed to tell
you breakfast is ready.

289
00:19:50,516 --> 00:19:52,318
Well, I'll be there
in a second, okay?

290
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,186
It's okay, I'll wait.

291
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,793
You're sittin' on my pants.

292
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:12,471
Why are you hiding?

293
00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:14,039
I guess I'm shy.

294
00:20:15,307 --> 00:20:17,376
One, two

295
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:22,381
Three, four, five.

296
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,948
Mmm.

297
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:26,485
Mornin'.

298
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,288
Oh, shit! Denim, get up there.

299
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:31,557
Oh, goodness.

300
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,428
Alright, babe, here we go!

301
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:39,331
Hit it, hit it, hit it!

302
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:41,100
Hoo!

303
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:44,303
- Good mornin'!
- Morning.

304
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,804
You guys have met,
now where's your sister?

305
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,207
Painting her nails.

306
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,475
Well, tell her
that breakfast is ready

307
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:50,276
and get her butt down here.

308
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:51,043
Okay!

309
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:55,980
Alright. Oof, oops!

310
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:59,718
Do you
want some SunnyD?

311
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,253
Yeah.

312
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:05,624
She's a doll.

313
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:07,626
Denim? Denim's a boy.

314
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,429
But I can't get him to stop
wearin' his sister's clothing,

315
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:11,563
so

316
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:15,567
I'm sorry about last night.

317
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,269
I don't care about that.

318
00:21:20,773 --> 00:21:22,541
We can try again.

319
00:21:22,675 --> 00:21:25,778
Are we disturbing?

320
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,315
Periwinkle Blue,
this is Wayland.

321
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,915
He was my high school
sweetheart, remember?

322
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,318
The jailbird?

323
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:34,586
Uh-uh, you need to
watch your mouth, missy.

324
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,725
So, what'd
you do time for?

325
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:40,726
Armed robbery.

326
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,061
Ooh! Where?

327
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:43,895
Video lottery joint.

328
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:45,097
Cool!

329
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,598
And he didn't snitch.

330
00:21:46,732 --> 00:21:47,999
What's snitch?

331
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:50,369
It's like tattle-telling
on something.

332
00:21:50,502 --> 00:21:51,270
I don't snitch neither!

333
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:53,505
Uh-uh, I see you! I made eggs.

334
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:56,075
Yeah, well, you're just
showin' off for Wayland.

335
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,543
She never makes breakfast.

336
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:01,447
Dodger Blue!

337
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:05,883
You wanna meet Wayland?

338
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,091
Will you say "hi" to Wayland?

339
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,594
Hi to Wayland.

340
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:18,896
I named all of my kids
after different shades of blue.

341
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:21,999
Periwinkle Blue, Denim
Blue, Dodger Blue.

342
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:24,603
Alright,
what are we missin'?

343
00:22:28,005 --> 00:22:29,274
Is everything okay?

344
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:30,609
Hmm? Yeah.

345
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:35,714
How much ya benchin' there?

346
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:37,216
120.

347
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,752
You might wanna think
about droppin' some weight.

348
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:41,286
Work on your form a bit.

349
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,122
Back off, man! I
know what I'm doing!

350
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,456
C'mon, you guys!

351
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:46,358
Okay.

352
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:47,693
Wayland, you're
head of the table!

353
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:48,960
Wayland, c'mon!

354
00:22:49,094 --> 00:22:49,894
Hey, hey, hey!
Wanna see my tongue?

355
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:50,995
Wanna see my tongue?

356
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,869
Dodger, come and eat
this stupid gross stuff.

357
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,470
I just need to
go to the bathroom.

358
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,106
Hey, baby.

359
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,346
Why'd he go the wrong way?

360
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,559
Hey,
Jenny here with the KBNP

361
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:21,993
radio traffic report.

362
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:23,896
Emergency crews still
cautioning motorists

363
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,531
to avoid the Cornell Road area

364
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:29,868
after a fully loaded log
truck overturned last night.

365
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:47,286
Alright.

366
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:49,987
I put my name.

367
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:51,457
Now click on "Next."

368
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,660
Next

369
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:56,662
No, it's the left button.

370
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,097
"Past Employment."

371
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,671
I mean, II got nothin'.

372
00:24:05,804 --> 00:24:08,040
Didn't you have a
job after high school?

373
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,211
I harvested some
Christmas trees.

374
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:13,679
Write it. Mm-hmm.

375
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,555
Did you stay at
Dolores' last night?

376
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:29,061
I just hope you kept it covered.

377
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:30,262
If there's one thing
she doesn't need,

378
00:24:30,395 --> 00:24:32,297
it's more babies.

379
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:34,900
At least that would give
you another soul to save!

380
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:43,942
Hey, Bobbi!

381
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,645
Hey! Hey!

382
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,913
Hey, that's enough,

383
00:24:48,046 --> 00:24:48,814
- that's enough!
- Alright.

384
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:57,122
Look who I found
skulkin' around outside!

385
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,157
Hey, where you
been all week, boy?

386
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:02,561
- Church!
- Fuck that.

387
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:04,263
This is Wiley.

388
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:07,666
Wow. He looks
just like your dad.

389
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,801
Yeah, poor little feller!

390
00:25:09,935 --> 00:25:11,770
And it's his nap time,
I'm gonna put him down.

391
00:25:13,338 --> 00:25:14,973
C'mon, little man, let's go.

392
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,942
And Jeanie's eight.

393
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,577
She's with my mom.

394
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:22,648
Kids wouldn't exist if it
wasn't for you, Wayland.

395
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:27,286
Well, no point in both
of us gettin' busted.

396
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,421
I swear to God, if it
was Kurt went to prison,

397
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:31,189
he'd have gotten himself killed.

398
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,158
I don't think so.

399
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:37,062
You change, you know.
You kinda have to.

400
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:39,164
Well, ain't none
of us kids no more.

401
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:43,869
We're in distribution now.

402
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:44,870
Cotton, fent.

403
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,705
Fuckin' low-stakes shit.

404
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:52,377
But you know Kurt! He likes to
keep the peace 'round here.

405
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,646
Hey Bobbi, you need to
quit runnin' your mouth.

406
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,382
Unless, of course, you
wanna run it on this.

407
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,054
Hey! Found it at the clubhouse.

408
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,821
Gotta take care of
your colors, man.

409
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:06,925
The times we had
though, huh Wayland?

410
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,629
Hey, when you gonna come out
and haul ass with us, huh?

411
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:13,265
You know you're patched for
life after what you did.

412
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,370
That preacher breathin'
down your neck?

413
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:19,738
Nah, not really.

414
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,974
She's just helpin'
me find a job.

415
00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:23,475
You don't gotta
worry about that.

416
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:26,178
Dirty Dooley, he's
gonna build you a bike.

417
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,479
- Bobbi!
- Hmm?

418
00:26:27,613 --> 00:26:29,147
Jesus!

419
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,184
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

420
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:34,786
Surprise!

421
00:26:38,423 --> 00:26:40,626
I saw Dolores the other night.

422
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,327
Yeah. That's
just a matter of time...

423
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:43,762
I don't wanna hear that
woman's name in my house!

424
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,631
You know she went around
bad mouthin' the club

425
00:26:45,764 --> 00:26:47,100
after you left?

426
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,967
Screwdriver, Devil
rest his soul,

427
00:26:49,102 --> 00:26:50,636
he was gonna

428
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:53,805
Kurt talked him 'round outta
respect for you, I guess.

429
00:26:53,939 --> 00:26:56,208
Never saw two kids love
each other the way you did.

430
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:58,010
Are you shittin' me?

431
00:26:58,143 --> 00:26:59,511
As soon as he got locked up,

432
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:01,179
she was out humpin'
anything with a heartbeat!

433
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:02,581
Oh, Bobbi, what d'you expect?

434
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:05,317
She was just a kid,
she was barely 18.

435
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,618
Yeah, well

436
00:27:07,786 --> 00:27:11,690
Like Bobbi said, ain't
none of us kids no more.

437
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:20,899
What, you
couldn't even say goodbye?

438
00:27:21,034 --> 00:27:21,900
Hey!

439
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:25,404
Why did you take off like that?

440
00:27:25,537 --> 00:27:27,106
Too fuckin' chicken-shit?

441
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,173
It's not you...

442
00:27:28,306 --> 00:27:29,574
Oh, it's the kids.

443
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,411
Is that what you're
gonna fucking say to me?

444
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:35,081
Fucking asshole.

445
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:54,433
We were somethin', me and you.

446
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:59,805
You think I don't know that?

447
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,542
You already
donated twice this week.

448
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:44,976
Come back Monday.

449
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,148
- New donor?
- Yeah.

450
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,982
- Fill this out.
- Okay.

451
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:53,018
Little bit more info.

452
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:00,659
Wayland!

453
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,496
Well, goddamn!

454
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:05,831
So, they let you out?

455
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:07,566
Well, sure looks
like it, don't it?

456
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:10,402
How you been, Violet?

457
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:13,306
Never mind me. You
sellin' your blood now?

458
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:14,906
Jesus, that's fuckin' bleak.

459
00:30:16,242 --> 00:30:18,343
Dude, II toldt-

460
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,744
Fuck you!

461
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,613
I told Aunt Bess I'd
look out for you is all.

462
00:30:21,746 --> 00:30:23,915
Well, she ain't around
to find out, so

463
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,718
I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

464
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:30,789
Yeah, I know. I was there.

465
00:30:30,922 --> 00:30:32,457
We're not all like you, Wayland.

466
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,759
Some of us, we give a
shit about our family.

467
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:37,096
Hey, if you're
shittin' yourself, pull over!

468
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,931
Fella behind ya
seems to wanna pass.

469
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:42,068
Get your
ass off the fuckin' road!

470
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:44,736
Fuck you, you petty
ass motherfucker!

471
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,272
Am I stoppin' ya?

472
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:47,273
Go fuck yourself!

473
00:30:47,405 --> 00:30:49,242
Look longer, bitch!

474
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,910
Hey, um, listen.

475
00:30:52,044 --> 00:30:53,511
I can ask Gordie
if there's, like,

476
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:56,215
a job at the yard or somethin'.

477
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:58,416
Yeah, sure. It
can't hurt to ask.

478
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,885
Yeah, you know

479
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:01,987
I mean, I'm not sure what
it's gonna be, but

480
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,224
better than this, man.

481
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:07,226
Hey, burn in hell, you...

482
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,128
Oh fuck, it's a school bus!

483
00:31:09,262 --> 00:31:10,629
I'll see ya around, Vi.

484
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:12,731
Yeah, I'llrI'll see you around.

485
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,510
Hey, Wayland!
Look what I can do!

486
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,580
- Hahaha. Nice!
- Watch me!

487
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:32,450
No, babe, like this. Up,
to the side andwhoop!

488
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,787
Woo!

489
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:37,656
Look at you, you're
still a spring chicken.

490
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:39,058
Remember, it's
the up, side, twist.

491
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,592
Here you go.

492
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:43,595
They're just gas
station flowers.

493
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:45,964
They're great.

494
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:01,880
So, you wanna move
outta the halfway house

495
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:04,549
and into your girlfriend's
house, correct?

496
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:06,352
Yes.

497
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:07,619
You've been out for one month.

498
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:09,020
We knew each
other from before.

499
00:32:09,155 --> 00:32:11,523
Hmm. Says here she
has a part-time job

500
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,992
and hasthree children?

501
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:16,995
Yep.

502
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,431
Well, she ain't winning any
Mother of the Year awards

503
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,399
bringin' you home.

504
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:22,068
I didn't hurt nobody.

505
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:24,303
You fired at an
off-duty police officer,

506
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:25,371
what do you call that?

507
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:26,471
Payback.

508
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:27,806
What d'you say?

509
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:35,780
I thought he was one of
them video lottery junkies.

510
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,184
And I missed him. On purpose.

511
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:39,818
Yeah, what about the
three prison assaults?

512
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:41,786
They were fights. I
was defending myself.

513
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,122
Two years in the hole?

514
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:48,760
So, tell me 'bout this job.

515
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:51,930
It's with my cousin's fella.

516
00:32:52,064 --> 00:32:55,567
Two days a week to start, but
I'm hopin' that it turns into...

517
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,037
Work address,
girlfriend address.

518
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,538
"I'm concerned Wayland may be
rushing into things with Dolores

519
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,209
without fully understanding the
responsibility he's taking on."

520
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,211
This is from Pastor
Gail, by the way.

521
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:06,745
"On the other hand,
intimate relationships

522
00:33:06,878 --> 00:33:08,180
are known to reduce
recidivism rates

523
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:09,514
Blah, blah, blah.

524
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:10,582
"I recommend you
approve his request

525
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,784
to change his dwelling."

526
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:19,758
Well, if the pastor
lady insists

527
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:22,560
That's it? It's approved?

528
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,365
I do one good deed per client

529
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:27,766
to establish goodwill.

530
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,137
That way, when you fuck
up, and tsk, tsk

531
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,271
I don't get to feel bad.

532
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:35,107

This is the
radio program for listeners

548
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,798
concerned with
taxation on real estate

549
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:43,269
based on assessments
that may be outdated.

550
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,671
Hey! Got your
paycheck for this week.

551
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:58,350
Hey Gord,
I was wondering

552
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:01,886
if you might have any
extra days for me?

553
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,522
I just moved in with
my girlfriend and...

554
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,923
Yeah, sorry, pal.

555
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:06,325
We're runnin' a tight
ship around here.

556
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:10,995
You're doin' good work though.

557
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:14,966
I got to admit, I had
my doubts about you.

558
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,003
Butseems like prison
straightened you out.

559
00:36:20,372 --> 00:36:22,274
Yep, it'll do that.

560
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:34,286
Shake it!

561
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:37,256
Hey, good lookin'!

562
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:38,756
Yeah.

563
00:36:58,611 --> 00:36:59,811
Hey!

564
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,913
Hey!

565
00:37:03,515 --> 00:37:05,484
No, stop!

566
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:06,851
Why?

567
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:08,687
I didn't brush my
teeth this mornin'.

568
00:37:09,954 --> 00:37:11,923
I gotta be careful.

569
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:14,660
People in my family, they
lost their teeth young.

570
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:16,428
I had a bunkmate in prison,

571
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,099
he used to sell his
teeth for drugs.

572
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:22,834
You can get money for teeth?

573
00:37:22,967 --> 00:37:24,203
Gold teeth, yeah.

574
00:37:24,336 --> 00:37:26,305
Well, I don't have
any gold teeth, so

575
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:28,340
Oh!

576
00:37:28,474 --> 00:37:32,344
Sorry! I'm sorry.

577
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,779
I think she was
lookin' at your tits.

578
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:38,384
Uh-huh. I think you
were lookin' somewhere.

579
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,558
Hey, did you ask Lordy
Gordie for some more hours?

580
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:50,195
Wayland?

581
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,330
Yep.

582
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:53,465
Yeah, he's lookin' into it.

583
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,069
Hey, you want some
breakfast leftovers?

584
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:59,104
- I stole some.
- Nah, I'm good.

585
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,007
Oh, I'm so hungry!

586
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:08,880
Did I tell you about
my dream last night?

587
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:10,115
What dream?

588
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:11,750
I was goin' to the ocean

589
00:38:12,817 --> 00:38:17,189
And I was almost there, like
I could nearly touch it.

590
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:20,592
But just something
kept gettin' in my way,

591
00:38:20,726 --> 00:38:24,296
like it was like thispinvisible wall o

592
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:30,968
I dunno, I've had that dream,
like, three or four times.

593
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,105
I don't think
dreams mean too much.

594
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,208
It's just your mind
clearin' shit out.

595
00:38:36,342 --> 00:38:38,110
I think they're
pretty darn clever.

596
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:41,513
Like they know all your secrets.

597
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:45,284
Well, I don't dream, so

598
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,086
Well, that's 'cos you
sleep with one eye open,

599
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:48,620
like you're still in prison.

600
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:54,493
Yeah, dude, she
opened the door

601
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,228
and she said, I swear
the fuck...-Nooo! No!

602
00:38:56,362 --> 00:38:57,463
I swear the fuck, she said,

603
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:59,131
she said...-What?

604
00:38:59,264 --> 00:39:00,332
Slob
on my titties

605
00:39:00,466 --> 00:39:02,900
Stop! What?

606
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:04,303
Shut up!

607
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:05,903
No-no...
So then I got in the car

608
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:08,240
and she literally
took off her cardigan.

609
00:39:08,374 --> 00:39:09,742
And the thing you gotta
do in these situations,

610
00:39:09,874 --> 00:39:10,975
you gotta be all suave.

611
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,977
You gotta be like
some James Bond.

612
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:15,547
I feel you, I feel you.

613
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,216
First, I
tell her she's beautiful

614
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:18,517
and what not.

615
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,052
Then I say, "Hey babe,
let me dip it in

616
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:21,120
for a second.

617
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:22,954
Swear on the Bible I won't cum."

618
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:26,358
90, 95 percent of the
time, it's all it takes.

619
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:28,327
Or you just give
it to her in the ass.

620
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,631
Bro, what are you? Some
kind of faggot or somethin'?

621
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:36,502
What about shit dick, bro?

622
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,772
Yeah, what about
decency? Dodger?

623
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,575
Out of my way.

624
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:44,942
Don't be leavin' empties
on my front porch.

625
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:46,545
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Wayland!

626
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:47,945
There's another
six-pack in the fridge.

627
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,281
Why don't you go grab it?

628
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,684
Your balls so big you
can't go to the fridge

629
00:39:52,818 --> 00:39:54,186
and get your own beer?

630
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:55,854
Ooh!
Bro, joke's on him.

631
00:39:55,987 --> 00:39:59,023
He doesn't know you don't
even have hair on your balls!

00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:12,997
Okay.

654
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,967
- Lola!
- Okay.

655
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,169
I'm coming.

656
00:41:17,302 --> 00:41:18,504
We need to move
it or somethin', I dunno.

657
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,339
Okay, well,
then, pick it up!

658
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:21,874
Ugh! I'm not touching that!

659
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:22,941
You touch it!

660
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:24,877
No, it's slimy.

661
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:26,311
Wayland, look at this!

662
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:30,649
- Watch out, watch out!
- Oh, my gosh!

663
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,783
Stop!

664
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:35,654
It was dying.

665
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:39,691
You could have fucking
put it in the swimming pool!

666
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:42,427
Well, and then what?
Keep it as, like, a pet?

667
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,730
You did the right
thing, Wayland.

668
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,731
Did you take
money outta my purse?

669
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:55,233
No.

670
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:59,838
Well, I had $30 in there.

671
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,741
Maybe the kids took it.

672
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:03,775
No, they don't do that.

673
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:05,110
They know better.

674
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,948
You gave me money for
cigarettes the other day.

675
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,750
When?

676
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:13,318
Like Tuesday.

677
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:16,154
You wanted some of them
bootleg cigarettes from Idaho.

678
00:43:18,023 --> 00:43:19,758
Oh, fuck.

679
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:20,892
What?

680
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,432
Relax!

681
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,437
We got food in the fridge,
we got gas in the tank.

682
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:33,505
We're good this week.

683
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:35,540
It's Peri's birthday tomorrow.

684
00:43:55,128 --> 00:43:56,762
Hey, we'll figure it out!

685
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,143
You know, I think I saw

686
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,710
you more when you
were incarcerated!

687
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:13,779
I gotta keep them
home fires burnin', man!

688
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:16,214
Yeah, I guess, huh?

689
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:20,285
Hey, listen, I'm
gonna need a lick.

690
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:21,553
Can't be anything too dicey,

691
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:23,622
- but, uh...
- I got you, man.

692
00:44:23,755 --> 00:44:27,659
You ain't gonna like it.
But, hell, it's money.

693
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:30,429
I'll take it.

694
00:45:25,784 --> 00:45:28,253
It's Lucky Families
and tonight's contestants are

695
00:45:28,386 --> 00:45:32,125
Lily, Chester, Herb Jr.,
Grace, and Herb Sr.,

696
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:33,391
the Franklin family!

697
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,395
Goddamn.

698
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:41,134
I'm a lucky son-of-a-bitch.

699
00:45:41,266 --> 00:45:46,038
Oh, you don't
even know the half of it.

700
00:45:46,172 --> 00:45:47,472
What are you talkin' about?

701
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:49,407
You know, after
Denim was born,

702
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,543
they gave me a script
for Lorazepam.

703
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:52,811
And I couldn't even take it

704
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:54,946
because I had to
sell it for diapers.

705
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:00,719
You wanna know
who his daddy was?

706
00:46:03,622 --> 00:46:05,724
Dodger's kindergarten teacher.

707
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,561
He was married

708
00:46:09,694 --> 00:46:11,696
And when he found
out I was pregnant,

709
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:17,936
he left the state with
his wife and his kids.

710
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,538
What a man!

711
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:23,708
Peri's father was a
fuckin' lowlife tweaker

712
00:46:23,842 --> 00:46:26,511
livin' out in the woods
somewhere, and

713
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:30,482
God knows
where he is now.

714
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:36,088
So, yeah, you are a
lucky son-of-a-bitch.

715
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:42,295
We were gonna move to LA
after I finished high school.

716
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,096
We were gonna watch
the sun go down

717
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,997
on Sunset Boulevard

718
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:47,465
And not go to sleep

719
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,669
Until it came
up the next mornin'.

720
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:51,803
Yeah.

721
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:58,077
And now I'm a maid
with three kids,

722
00:46:58,211 --> 00:46:59,778

and we haven't
left our hometown,

724
00:47:01,813 --> 00:47:08,154
and we are stuck.
We're just

725
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,589
I have work.

726

I know you do.

727
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:14,926
Then why'd you say
I don't have work?

728
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:19,531

wasn't supposed to be like this.

I can tell.

761
00:48:56,128 --> 00:48:57,263
You can tell what?

762
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:59,965
That it's used. I
mean, I know we're broke,

Never mind.

an asshole, I promise.

one, and that one right here.

792
00:50:47,806 --> 00:50:49,308

00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:17,236
- D'you see those gift cards?
- What gift cards?

796
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,171
Do you remember when Denim
got sick at that restaurant,

797
00:51:19,305 --> 00:51:21,273
and the manager gave
us those gift cards?

798
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:22,807
I put 'em in this drawer,

799
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:23,775
and I know you're always rootin'
around through my shit...

800
00:51:23,908 --> 00:51:25,111
I didn't do anything!

801
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:26,545
- What's goin' on?
- I just remembered

802
00:51:26,678 --> 00:51:29,081
that we have Polar
King gift cards.

803
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:31,283
But I can't fuckin' find 'em.

804
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:32,784
So, fuck!

805
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:34,386
No big deal, let's
find the gift cards. Hmm?

806
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,356
Kids, let's go! Let's
find these gift cards.

807
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:39,091
Whyyy?

808
00:51:39,225 --> 00:51:41,227
'Cos Peri's gonna get
a nice meal tonight, dumbass.

809
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,528
It's okay, Lola,

810
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,230
I don't need to go out.
It's okay!.

such a shitty mom

812
00:51:45,997 --> 00:51:47,500
I can't take you out on
your own birthday now?

813
00:51:47,632 --> 00:51:50,169
Hey! I found 'em.

814
00:51:50,302 --> 00:51:55,407
Good! Alright, well,
now we can get ready.

815
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,343
Gonna get ready and go out!

816
00:52:06,784 --> 00:52:09,954
Aah!
Good shot, baby.

817
00:52:10,089 --> 00:52:11,823
How was
everything today, good?

818
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:13,092
- Great.
- Good, thanks.

819
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:15,026
Whenever you're ready,
take your time.

820
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:17,795
Oh, you know what? I
actually have some gift cards.

821
00:52:18,897 --> 00:52:22,667
And I think they're
gonna cover it.

822
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,771
Yep. Here you go.

823
00:52:33,078 --> 00:52:35,114
Everything o-okay? Are
they expired, or

824
00:52:35,247 --> 00:52:37,849
Oh no, our gift
cards never expire.

825
00:52:37,982 --> 00:52:39,451
Would you want me to
bring your change?

826
00:52:39,585 --> 00:52:41,086
Yes, please.

827
00:52:43,656 --> 00:52:44,889
Alright!

828
00:52:56,734 --> 00:53:01,640
Who wants to play karaoke?

829
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:03,808
Periwinkle?

830
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:32,737
Buy it now, get
it now at Banner Furniture...

831
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,839
They're using
Centers for Disease Control data

832
00:53:34,973 --> 00:53:36,874
to really amplify
the national conversation

833
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:38,711
about what they call
deaths of despair,

834
00:53:38,843 --> 00:53:41,547
so deaths due to
alcohol, drugs, and...

835
00:54:45,511 --> 00:54:46,445
Hey, Wayland!

836
00:54:46,578 --> 00:54:47,845
Yeah?

837
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:49,248
I'm thinkin' I'll
enlist when I turn 18.

838
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:51,116
What do you think? Will
I pass the physical?

839
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,185
Yeah, you'll pass the
physical, no problem.

840
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:55,521
But you're only 15, you don't
need to worry about that.

841
00:54:55,654 --> 00:54:58,157
Hey, you know if Lola took
the car this mornin' or what?

842
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,024
Yeah, she drove off somewhere.

843
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:03,729
Shit! I gotta get to work.

844
00:55:03,861 --> 00:55:06,498
Actually, I already decided.

845
00:55:06,632 --> 00:55:07,499
Hmm?

846
00:55:07,633 --> 00:55:09,335
I'm enlisting.

847
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:17,376
You know you gotta start
at the bottom, right?

848
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:19,778
They're gonna treat
you like shit.

849
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:21,913
Treat you like

850
00:55:22,047 --> 00:55:25,250
Like a nobody.

851
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:27,186
Well, I'm a nobody now, so

852
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:31,223
What are you talkin'
about, who told you that?

853
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:35,594
I just am. So are you.
So's this whole family.

854
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:37,396
Hey!

855
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:40,232
Stop smokin' that shit

856
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:42,668
if you wanna join the army.

857
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:44,136
Fuck you.

858
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,289
Fuck.

859
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:08,594
Meet me outside!

860
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:10,995
You're all set, pal.

861
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:13,532
Why don't you head into
the office, and, uh

862
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:15,234
she'll finish up with you.

863
00:56:24,276 --> 00:56:27,146
That's good, yep. Just
cut it off right there.

864
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:32,251
Wow! Let me give you a hand.

865
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:33,852
This brings me back, man!

866
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:37,122
I used to get the
one called the Screwball.

867
00:56:37,256 --> 00:56:39,591
Had the, um, two little
gumballs at the end,

868
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:42,994
made you feel like you was
gettin' somethin' extra.

869
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:45,464
Nobody'll buy her from me.

870
00:56:45,597 --> 00:56:50,135
She's been sittin' in
my yard for ten years.

871
00:56:50,269 --> 00:56:52,337
I can give you $250.

872
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:54,106
Well, don't break the bank!

873
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:57,209
You scrap her, you're
gonna get $300, tops.

874
00:56:57,342 --> 00:56:58,811
Mind if I have a look?

875
00:57:01,346 --> 00:57:02,548
She needs a lotta work.

876
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:03,649
Yeah, I see that.

877
00:57:03,782 --> 00:57:08,053
Steering, brakes, carburetor.

878
00:57:08,187 --> 00:57:09,822
I don't mind work.

879
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:13,958
Bucks your age don't
know the meanin' of work.

880
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:20,098
All's you want is to win
some TV singin' contest.

881
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:21,567
Well, I can't sing, so...

882
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,868
Huh?

883
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,037
I said I can't sing.

884
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:27,606
Me neither.

885
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:33,278
I've been tone deaf since
before I lost my hearing.

886
00:57:36,915 --> 00:57:39,184
You'll fix her up good?

887
00:57:43,155 --> 00:57:45,022
Housekeeping.

888
00:58:16,154 --> 00:58:19,023
Howdy!

889
00:58:19,157 --> 00:58:20,292
Oh, my God!

890
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:21,960
What do you think?

891
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:23,795
Strawberry Burst

892
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:27,933
Um, the King Size Cone Bunny
Tracks and the Choco Taco.

893
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:32,337
I want King Size Cone Bunny
Tracks, Rainbow, Cherry,

894
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:37,276
Green Apple, Lemon,
and Hawaiian Punch.

895
00:58:43,248 --> 00:58:44,416
Hey, Wayland,
what are you gonna do

896
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,318
when you fix this thing up?

897
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:49,888
I dunno. I'll
probably sell it.

898
00:58:50,022 --> 00:58:51,323
Butyou know,

899
00:58:51,456 --> 00:58:53,559
maybe I'll start my own
business, who knows?

900
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:02,601
- Wayland?
- Yeah?

901
00:59:02,734 --> 00:59:04,102
I think you should
come to our school

902
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:06,505
and give everyone
free ice cream.

903
00:59:06,638 --> 00:59:08,340
Like they deserve it.

904
00:59:08,473 --> 00:59:10,375
Why, what's
goin' on at school?

905
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,278
They say we should
be on Jerry Springer.

906
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:15,180
Why do they say that?

907
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:17,716
Those kids
are so fucking dumb.

908
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:20,285
They don't even care if
you're a nice person.

909
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:22,854
Basically, you need
cool stuff to be cool,

910
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:26,258
and the only thing I have
is the karaoke machine

911
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:29,161
from my jackass sperm donor.

912
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:33,432
Here we are.

913
00:59:37,502 --> 00:59:39,104
Pretty spot, huh?

914
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:45,744
She came here before she died,
picked out her own plot.

915
00:59:45,877 --> 00:59:47,145
Really?

916
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:50,083
Mm-hmm.

917
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:52,384
Said she never had
a view in her life.

918
00:59:52,517 --> 00:59:55,520
She sure as hell was gonna
have one when she died.

919
00:59:59,524 --> 01:00:02,327
That's my ol' man right there.

920
01:00:02,461 --> 01:00:04,363
She didn't wanna be
anywhere near him.

921
01:00:09,534 --> 01:00:11,169
I found her!

922
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:30,288
Little bit different
than last time, eh, Ma?

923
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,290
What happened last time?

924
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:37,863
I was in handcuffs,
chained to a prison guard.

925
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:46,838
I'll take those.

926
01:01:15,134 --> 01:01:16,968
There we go.

927
01:01:17,103 --> 01:01:18,403
Where d'you get those?

928
01:01:18,537 --> 01:01:20,238
Stole 'em from one
of the other graves.

929
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,607
Yeah? Who taught you to steal?

930
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:24,342
Duh, I live with a robber.

931
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:29,781
Wow.

932
01:01:29,915 --> 01:01:35,554
You're just like Ma,
full of piss and vinegar.

933
01:01:35,687 --> 01:01:38,390
She woulda liked you.

934
01:01:38,523 --> 01:01:39,791
Hey, I was thinkin'

935
01:01:39,925 --> 01:01:42,627
Maybe I come by school
one of these days.

936
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:45,964
Give those Jerry Springer fans
somethin' to talk about, huh?

937
01:01:46,099 --> 01:01:48,734
Why, 'cos you're so thug?

938
01:01:50,203 --> 01:01:54,473
I spy with my little eye
something beginning withP!

939
01:01:54,606 --> 01:01:59,145
UmPinky? Puddle? Pool?

940
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:01,080
That's Lola's car!

941
01:02:01,214 --> 01:02:03,248
She's
supposed to be at work.

942
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:20,899
And
five, six, seven, eight.

943
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:30,308
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight

944
01:02:33,912 --> 01:02:35,847
Now, we bring them
up to the ears,

945
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:38,650
like we're making
snow angels, perfect.

946
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:40,418
And then up and back down.

947
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:44,356
Alright, arms
straight out in a T

948
01:02:44,489 --> 01:02:45,924
and then pulsing!

949
01:02:46,058 --> 01:02:55,934
For eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

950
01:03:29,202 --> 01:03:30,936
What's that?

951
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:33,206
My new wheels.

952
01:03:33,338 --> 01:03:35,674
How was your day?

953
01:03:35,807 --> 01:03:39,078
Same ol', same ol'.

954
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:41,913
Really?

955
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,516
I went by the pool.

956
01:03:44,649 --> 01:03:46,384
Saw your car in the
parking lot.

957
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:48,120
You were supposed to
be at work.

958
01:03:52,457 --> 01:03:55,026
That's 'cos I quit.

959
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,870
Now, don't be mad.

960
01:04:05,003 --> 01:04:07,505
Look, some guest
schizzed out last night

961
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:10,475
and smeared shit
all over the walls.

962
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:12,911
And guess who had
to clean it up?

963
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:14,646
You shoulda called me.

964
01:04:14,779 --> 01:04:16,615
I'd have come back, I'd
have cleaned it up for you.

965
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:19,885
No, 'cos we're
better than that.

966
01:04:20,018 --> 01:04:24,456
Really? I cleaned
up shit in prison.

967
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:26,024
I cleaned up after
my grammy's shit

968
01:04:26,158 --> 01:04:27,692
when things got bad,

969
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:29,961
but we are not cleaning up
after some dirty-ass tweaker.

970
01:04:30,096 --> 01:04:32,931
You know I'm makin' pin
money down at the yard, right?

971
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:35,034
Just make Gordie give
you some more hours.

972
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:38,803
He's my boss. I can't
make him do anything.

973
01:04:38,937 --> 01:04:42,540
Look, I'm gonna get another
job, okay, I promise.

974
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:44,542
I'm just gonna need you to

975
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:46,778
Just pitch in, just
a little bit more.

976
01:04:46,912 --> 01:04:48,413
I have been pitching in...

977
01:04:48,546 --> 01:04:52,550
Fuck, man! They're
not even my

978
01:04:55,321 --> 01:04:58,790
Just say it. Say it,
I know you want to.

979
01:04:58,924 --> 01:05:00,759
They're not your kids!

980
01:05:05,164 --> 01:05:07,499
They're not your kids.

981
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:18,643
But they should have been.

982
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,718
We should have
made them together.

983
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:42,201
Mornin'.

984
01:05:42,335 --> 01:05:44,536
What's up with them
extra hours, Gord?

985
01:05:44,669 --> 01:05:47,772
Extra hours? Did
you say extra hours?

986
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:48,573
Yeah.

987
01:05:48,707 --> 01:05:50,475
Oh, boy, that's good!

988
01:05:50,608 --> 01:05:56,282
Come here for a second.

989
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:57,849
Come here!

990
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,520
Shit!

991
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:05,424
See, I'm tryna run a good, clean busine

992
01:06:05,557 --> 01:06:06,758
Nobody saw us.

993
01:06:06,891 --> 01:06:08,893
What, you don't
think word gets around?

994
01:06:09,027 --> 01:06:11,796
I'll have junkies showin' up
here like ants at a picnic.

995
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,732
I fucked up, man, it's
not gonna happen again.

996
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:16,935
Okay, look. You're
my wife's cousin.

997
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:20,505
I'll keep the cops outta this.

998
01:06:20,638 --> 01:06:22,274
But you can't keep workin' here.

999
01:06:26,245 --> 01:06:28,080
C'mon, man.

1000
01:06:30,749 --> 01:06:32,084
I need this job.

1001
01:06:34,552 --> 01:06:36,389
Gordie, I need this fuckin' job!

1002
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,756
Yeah, well, you
probably should have

1003
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:39,791
tried a little harder
to hang onto it.

1004
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,230
Now get outta here
before I change my mind...

1005
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:56,841
Fuck! Hey
chimo, what's goin' on, bud?

1006
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:59,677
Sell a lot of lollipops today?

1007
01:06:59,811 --> 01:07:01,713
How's my Wiley?

1008
01:07:01,846 --> 01:07:03,548
Wiley Coyote.

1009
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:05,016
Oh, we'll send some
boys around there

1010
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:07,453
to rearrange his face
till it's real pretty.

1011
01:07:07,585 --> 01:07:10,755
Nah, no need.

1012
01:07:10,889 --> 01:07:13,925
It's my fault, you know.
Should have known better

1013
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,729
than to mix real business
with club business.

1014
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:20,999
Club's family, not business.

1015
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:23,269
I seem to remember you
sayin' that to me once before.

1016
01:07:23,402 --> 01:07:26,838
Hey, we took care of you.

1017
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:30,242
You know what you
need, baby? A night out.

1018
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:32,010
We're doin' a fundraiser
at the clubhouse later

1019
01:07:32,144 --> 01:07:33,878
to raise money for Moose's kid.

1020
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:35,580
Four-year-old with
fuckin' leukemia, man.

1021
01:07:35,713 --> 01:07:37,682
How fucked up is that?

1022
01:07:37,816 --> 01:07:39,318
Why don't you
take my bike, hmm?

1023
01:07:39,452 --> 01:07:41,353
Have yourself a little fun?

1024
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:07,979
Woo! Nice ride!

1025
01:08:08,114 --> 01:08:10,014
How'd that feel, huh?

1026
01:08:14,953 --> 01:08:16,188
Oh, shit! What's up, man?

1027
01:08:21,659 --> 01:08:22,861
Cheers, man.

1028
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:31,237
Look at this shit
here, huh?

1029
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,545
Come on, Jeannie!

1030
01:08:43,848 --> 01:08:45,783
Oh yeah, here we go!

1031
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,419
Come on, Jeannie!

1032
01:08:47,553 --> 01:08:48,853
You got it! You got it!

1033
01:08:48,987 --> 01:08:50,256
Here's my horse right here.

1034
01:08:50,389 --> 01:08:52,991
She's a nibbler!
She's a nibbler.

1035
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:55,628
Nibbler!

1036
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,463
Oh, here we go!

1037
01:08:57,596 --> 01:08:58,897
Oh, here we go!

1038
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:01,133
Lay-la,
Lay-la, Lay-la

1039
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:03,102
Woo!

1040
01:09:05,337 --> 01:09:07,239
Oh, shit!

1041
01:09:07,373 --> 01:09:09,741
Wow! Who's that?

01:09:43,409 --> 01:09:44,376
Hey!

1049
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:45,644
Hey.

1050
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,745
You wanna dance with me?

1051
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:49,747
I don't dance.

1052
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:52,351
Bro, she's got 'em
lined up out the door.

1053
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:55,321
Get off your ass and
dance with the lady!

1054
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,763
Cut it up there,
lefty. Let's go!

1055
01:10:05,897 --> 01:10:06,764
I hate you.

1056
01:10:38,464 --> 01:10:40,466
What?

1057
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:56,848
Sorry.

1058
01:11:14,633 --> 01:11:15,900
Get off!

1059
01:11:16,035 --> 01:11:17,403
Okay, we're
gonna put pants on.

1060
01:11:17,536 --> 01:11:18,404
- I don't want to!
- No, you have to.

1061
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:19,937
Stop!

1062
01:11:20,072 --> 01:11:21,440
I don't understand
what the problem is.

1063
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:22,874
I don't like this!

1064
01:11:23,007 --> 01:11:24,476
Just put
them on! Just...

1065
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:25,843
No, I said!

1066
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:27,346
Ugh.

1067
01:11:46,498 --> 01:11:47,599
These are good.

1068
01:11:47,733 --> 01:11:49,368
There's nothing wrong
with wearing jeans.

1069
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:50,968
Okay, let's just try.

1070
01:11:51,103 --> 01:11:52,438
- I want you to put them on.
- No!

1071
01:11:52,571 --> 01:11:54,473
Just take it off,
you're not a baby anymore.

1072
01:11:54,606 --> 01:11:56,075
- Come on!
- Nooo!

1073
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:58,577
- Yes, please!
- Stop! I don't want to!

1074
01:11:58,711 --> 01:12:00,512
- Just put them on!
- What's goin' on in there?

1075
01:12:00,646 --> 01:12:04,083
Some kid in his class saw him
wearin' a dress on the weekend.

1076
01:12:04,216 --> 01:12:07,586
Get off me!
- Come here!

1077
01:12:08,654 --> 01:12:15,794
Stop! No! I don't want
you to be bullied!

1078
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:21,433
I don't want that for you.
Just put it on! No!

1079
01:12:22,867 --> 01:12:24,969
Did you just spit at me?
Are you... Where did you...

1080
01:12:25,104 --> 01:12:26,472
Did you teach him that?

1081
01:12:26,605 --> 01:12:28,474
- Nope.
- Where did you learn that?

1082
01:12:28,607 --> 01:12:29,775
Leave him alone, Lola,

1083
01:12:29,907 --> 01:12:30,875
can't you see
you're hurting him?

1084
01:12:31,008 --> 01:12:32,478
You stay outta this!

1085
01:12:32,611 --> 01:12:34,546
No, you stay out of it,
no one even wants you here!

1086
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,348
- Well, it's my house!
- It's not your house,

1087
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:38,751
you don't own it, and
you're behind on rent.

1088
01:12:38,883 --> 01:12:40,552
When did you become so nasty?

1089
01:12:40,686 --> 01:12:42,588
I learned from the best.

1090
01:12:42,721 --> 01:12:44,922
- And what does that mean?
- It means your own kid

1091
01:12:45,057 --> 01:12:47,459
can't stand bein' in
the same room as you.

1092
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:52,064
Fine. Then, you take
care of him, then!

1093
01:12:52,197 --> 01:12:53,532
It'll be good practice

1094
01:12:53,665 --> 01:12:54,966
for when you get pregnant
in the next two years.

1095
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,137
I'm 12 years old, I'm a kid!

1096
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,304
I'm your
fuckin' kid, Lola!

1097
01:13:02,474 --> 01:13:05,544
That was Grammy's vase,
you little piece of shit!

1098
01:13:05,677 --> 01:13:07,279
- That was Grammy's vase!
- Calm down! Calm down.

1099
01:13:07,413 --> 01:13:09,415
- Let me fucking go!
- That's enough.

1100
01:13:09,548 --> 01:13:10,783
Clean that up!

1101
01:13:10,915 --> 01:13:12,016
- Shh.
- Let me fucking go!

1102
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:16,455
No, not until you
calm down. Okay?

1103
01:13:16,588 --> 01:13:20,024
Yeah, I'm okay.

1104
01:13:22,994 --> 01:13:27,065
You smell
like diesel and cheap perfume,

1105
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,468
you fucking asshole.

1106
01:13:35,174 --> 01:13:37,109
I hate you!

1107
01:13:37,242 --> 01:13:39,344
I know!

1108
01:13:47,186 --> 01:13:51,123
Dolores? Where are you goin'?

1109
01:13:51,256 --> 01:13:53,759
Baby? Don't leave!

1110
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:55,294
Dolores! Hey!

1111
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:54,186
Anyone ever tell you you snore?

1112
01:14:56,722 --> 01:14:57,923
You can go right here.

1113
01:14:58,056 --> 01:15:02,094
You can go right
here. You can

1114
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:14,706
Lola come back?

1115
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,277
No, she usually stays out
all night after a blowup.

1116
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:29,288
He doesn't wanna
go to school today.

1117
01:15:30,556 --> 01:15:35,193
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with Z!

1118
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:38,263
Shit, I dunno, uh

1119
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:44,903
Zipper? Xerox? Zero?

1120
01:15:45,837 --> 01:15:48,607
That's a number,
not a thing, dumbass!

1121
01:16:02,055 --> 01:16:05,257
You a Horseman, or
is this a goddamn circus?

1122
01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:07,826
Kurt sent me. Supposed
to make a pickup.

1123
01:16:10,662 --> 01:16:12,864
Club sure ain't
what it used to be

1124
01:16:12,998 --> 01:16:15,767
before Screwdriver passed.

1125
01:16:15,901 --> 01:16:17,402
Get back inside!

1126
01:16:26,144 --> 01:16:27,346
Thank you.

1127
01:16:31,283 --> 01:16:34,786
Zig-zag. On your dress.

1128
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,121
Did I get it right?

1129
01:16:41,326 --> 01:16:42,928
- Wayland?
- Yeah?

1130
01:16:43,062 --> 01:16:44,763
Can I call you Dad now?

1131
01:16:52,105 --> 01:16:53,405
What's the matter?

1132
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:55,907
You don't like Wayland?

1133
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,579
Well, that's my
granddaddy's name.

1134
01:17:00,712 --> 01:17:03,281
I think he'd be pretty upset
if I stopped usin' it.

1135
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,959
- Way?
- Where the hell are you?

1136
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:15,560
You won't
believe me if I tell you.

1137
01:17:15,694 --> 01:17:17,195
Quit fuckin' around
and come home, Dolores.

1138
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:19,464
I can't. I'm
on Sunset Boulevard.

1139
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:22,334
What? Where are you really?

1140
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:24,770
It's true.
I drove, and I drove,

1141
01:17:24,903 --> 01:17:27,339
and I drove, and I didn't
stop till I got to LA

1142
01:17:27,472 --> 01:17:28,974
Are you with a guy?

1143
01:17:29,108 --> 01:17:30,342
Is that what this is about?

1144
01:17:30,475 --> 01:17:31,510
No, no.

1145
01:17:31,643 --> 01:17:33,046
It's-it's me, I swear, it's me.

1146
01:17:33,178 --> 01:17:34,713
Then you are
out of your fuckin' mind.

1147
01:17:37,783 --> 01:17:39,818
I haven't had a minute
since the kids were born,

1148
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,120
and I need some...-
So what, you just

1149
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:42,521
Just time on my own.

1150
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:43,989
leave them with me?
You don't even ask?

1151
01:17:44,123 --> 01:17:45,557
Wayland, just
watch 'em for a few days,

1152
01:17:45,691 --> 01:17:47,959
okay, until I get
my head on straight.

1153
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:50,262
Hello?

1154
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:54,499
Fuck!

1155
01:18:05,911 --> 01:18:07,212
Fuck! Come here!

1156
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:09,648
You know I ain't
your real dad, right?

1157
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:11,117
Me livin' with you,
tyin' your shoes,

1158
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,751
playin' I Spy games...

1159
01:18:12,884 --> 01:18:13,919
None of that shit makes me your
dad, you know that, right?

1160
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:15,020
What then?

1161
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:17,056
What?

1162
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:18,924
What makes you my dad?

1163
01:18:23,762 --> 01:18:25,630
Come here.

1164
01:18:27,733 --> 01:18:28,934
You wanna stay in business
with the Horsemen,

1165
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:30,268
you're gonna have
to watch this kid

1166
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:32,270
for the next hour.

1167
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:35,074
Sweetie, I already
got my widow's pension.

1168
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:36,908
Club needs me more
than I need it.

1169
01:18:37,043 --> 01:18:39,112
Look, can you fuckin'
watch him or not?

1170
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,415
Well, sure, if he-she-whatever
behaves itself.

1171
01:18:43,548 --> 01:18:44,750
Come here.

1172
01:18:48,987 --> 01:18:49,855
Wayland...

1173
01:18:49,988 --> 01:18:52,357
Not another word.

1174
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:56,394
It's okay, I
ain't gonna eat ya.

1175
01:19:37,569 --> 01:19:38,904
C'mon!

1176
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:46,778
Woo! Woooo!

1177
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:49,681
Yap, yap, yoo!

1178
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:01,260
Brr, cold.

1179
01:20:01,393 --> 01:20:02,627
Well, get in here!

1180
01:20:13,438 --> 01:20:16,374
Ah, man, I wish I could stay.

1181
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:19,711
I gotta go. The boys
are waitin' for me.

1182
01:20:19,845 --> 01:20:21,446
I don't like
what you're doin', Way.

1183
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:22,914
We
need the money.

1184
01:20:23,049 --> 01:20:24,950
If we're serious about
LA, we need the money,

1185
01:20:25,084 --> 01:20:26,351
and I gotta get it.

1186
01:20:26,484 --> 01:20:28,054
- Stay with me, stay with me.
- No, I gotta go.

1187
01:20:28,187 --> 01:20:30,323
- Stay with me, stay with me.
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

1188
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:33,425
I gotta go, I gotta go.

1189
01:20:33,558 --> 01:20:35,228
Alright,
fuck it.

1190
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:38,396
I'll stay.

1191
01:21:03,256 --> 01:21:04,556
Where's the kid?

1192
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:06,458
I dunno. He's
around here somewhere.

1193
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,294
Fuck.

1194
01:21:08,426 --> 01:21:09,728
I told you to watch him!

1195
01:21:10,695 --> 01:21:11,897
Denim?

1196
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:14,866
Hey, Denim!

1197
01:21:18,403 --> 01:21:19,671
Denim!

1198
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:25,644
Denim!

1199
01:21:32,517 --> 01:21:34,019
Denim!

1200
01:21:36,088 --> 01:21:39,658
Hey, you seen a kid?
Like six years old?

1201
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:40,959
- Nope.
- No?

1202
01:21:41,093 --> 01:21:42,194
Sorry, pal.

1203
01:21:42,328 --> 01:21:43,062
Denim?

1204
01:21:45,497 --> 01:21:46,698
Denim!

1205
01:21:50,802 --> 01:21:52,138
Oh, fuck!

1206
01:21:53,805 --> 01:21:57,842
What are you doin'? Come here!

1207
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:05,217
What... Why'd you run away?

1208
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:07,219
Why'd you yell at me?

1209
01:22:07,353 --> 01:22:10,021
I don't know.

1210
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,724
I'm sorry.

1211
01:22:14,526 --> 01:22:15,627
Man, you scared
the shit outta me.

1212
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,462
You can't run away
like that, okay?

1213
01:22:33,611 --> 01:22:35,348
That's a guard dog,
not a pettin' dog.

1214
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,815
You understand?

1215
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:42,054
Hey, what's your name?

1216
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:43,456
I picked up that oxy
from your crazy-ass aunt.

1217
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:44,589
Yeah, right on.

1218
01:22:44,723 --> 01:22:45,957
Come on.

1219
01:22:46,092 --> 01:22:47,492
You peg that
little bitch yesterday?

1220
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:49,594
Kinda.

1221
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,628
Kinda?

1222
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:52,731
That's a good boy.

1223
01:22:52,864 --> 01:22:54,166
You alright, Wayles?

1224
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:56,701
Yeah

1225
01:22:58,737 --> 01:23:00,239
I don't know.

1226
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:04,043
I feel like I'm goin' down
the same old road, you know?

1227
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:05,910
What was that for?

1228
01:23:06,045 --> 01:23:07,979
- No, man, whaddya mean?
- Why'd you do that?

1229
01:23:08,114 --> 01:23:09,514
If I get caught
with any of that shit,

1230
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:12,784
I'm goin' back inside.
Automatically.

1231
01:23:18,224 --> 01:23:20,825
I thought maybe you could
hold onto this for me.

1232
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:22,761
Just for a little while.

1233
01:23:28,434 --> 01:23:29,701
Just gimme a second.

1234
01:23:37,942 --> 01:23:39,278
That dog bites your arm off,

1235
01:23:39,412 --> 01:23:40,612
it ain't gonna grow back.

1236
01:23:48,154 --> 01:23:52,158
Yeah, that's
a good boy. Aw!

1237
01:23:52,291 --> 01:23:54,226
Here, man, take it.

1238
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,228
What's this?

1239
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:02,334
Yeah!

1240
01:24:02,468 --> 01:24:04,002
I can't take this, Kurt.

1241
01:24:04,136 --> 01:24:05,204
Bullshit.

1242
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:06,638
I did a couple of
runs, man, that's it.

1243
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:08,573
You did 15 years.

1244
01:24:11,709 --> 01:24:13,179
You fuckin' take that,

1245
01:24:13,312 --> 01:24:15,281
and you take care of
your fuckin' family.

1246
01:24:18,016 --> 01:24:19,617
I know you know how to do that.

1247
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:24,290
You hear me, brother?

1248
01:24:24,423 --> 01:24:25,924
Yeah.

1249
01:24:40,206 --> 01:24:42,141
Alright, go inside.

1250
01:24:57,889 --> 01:24:59,791
Field visit!

1251
01:25:01,993 --> 01:25:03,895
You can't just
show up at my house.

1252
01:25:04,028 --> 01:25:05,297
Actually, Fourth
Amendment rights

1253
01:25:05,431 --> 01:25:06,898
don't apply to parolees,

1254
01:25:07,032 --> 01:25:08,833
meaning I can do
whatever the hell I want.

1255
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,470
What you got in that
little envelope?

1256
01:25:11,604 --> 01:25:13,038
Nothin'.

1257
01:25:13,172 --> 01:25:14,173
Nothin'?

1258
01:25:15,274 --> 01:25:16,275
Hand it over.

1259
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:25,917
Oh!

1260
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:27,353
Looks like you're doin'
really well for yourself.

1261
01:25:27,486 --> 01:25:28,987
What do you got here,
a couple of grand?

1262
01:25:29,121 --> 01:25:31,390
It's a loanso I can
start my own business.

1263
01:25:31,524 --> 01:25:32,790
Kurt gave you this?

1264
01:25:32,924 --> 01:25:35,327
Oh, yeah, I know where you been.

1265
01:25:35,461 --> 01:25:36,828
Denim told me.

1266
01:25:36,961 --> 01:25:40,732
He's a kid.
He makes shit up.

1267
01:25:40,865 --> 01:25:43,068
You could've taken
that plea bargain deal.

1268
01:25:43,202 --> 01:25:44,669
Kurt owes you.
I get it, I get it.

1269
01:25:44,802 --> 01:25:46,771
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1270
01:25:46,905 --> 01:25:48,407
So where's Dolores?

1271
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:49,408
She went out.

1272
01:25:49,542 --> 01:25:51,110
Out where?

1273
01:25:51,243 --> 01:25:52,511
Dunno.

1274
01:25:52,645 --> 01:25:55,013
You don't know,
the kids don't know.

1275
01:25:55,147 --> 01:25:56,915
I wonder if Child
Services knows.

1276
01:25:59,851 --> 01:26:01,253
You leave the kids outta this.

1277
01:26:02,687 --> 01:26:03,922
Or what?

1278
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:08,527
What'll you do when you
lose those kids, Wayland?

1279
01:26:09,827 --> 01:26:11,330
What's goin' on?

1280
01:26:13,165 --> 01:26:15,167
I wanna see a paper
trail for this cash.

1281
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:17,802
What's he want?

1282
01:26:17,936 --> 01:26:20,206
Don't worry about it.
Go inside.

1283
01:26:24,076 --> 01:26:25,344
Alright!
Who's hungry?

1284
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:26,811
Ooh, me!

1285
01:26:26,945 --> 01:26:28,214
I didn't mean to snitch.

1286
01:26:28,347 --> 01:26:29,381
He was askin' all
these questions and...

1287
01:26:29,515 --> 01:26:30,915
Hey, hey, hey.

1288
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:32,284
It's not your fault. Don't
worry about it, okay?

1289
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:34,086
Hey, um, where
is Lola, anyway?

1290
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:38,022
She's in LA.
She's in fuckin' LA.

1291
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:39,291
Are you kiddin' me?

1292
01:26:39,425 --> 01:26:41,260
Nope.
She's on vacation.

1293
01:26:41,393 --> 01:26:45,064
Wow, she really did it!
She played you real good.

1294
01:26:45,197 --> 01:26:46,798
What's that
supposed to mean?

1295
01:26:46,931 --> 01:26:50,135
Um, so, you came in
after five minutes.

1296
01:26:50,269 --> 01:26:52,671
You handled all her shit,
and then she knew right away

1297
01:26:52,804 --> 01:26:54,106
she could dump us on you.

1298
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,873
C'mon, Peri,
it's not like that.

1299
01:26:56,007 --> 01:26:57,742
Stop defendin'
her all the time!

1300
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,078
Well, if you didn't
constantly shit on her,

1301
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:00,512
maybe she'd still be here.

1302
01:27:00,646 --> 01:27:02,081
Easy for you to say,
you're her favorite.

1303
01:27:02,214 --> 01:27:03,415
She's actually nice to you!

1304
01:27:03,549 --> 01:27:05,117
She tried so hard
on your birthday,

1305
01:27:05,251 --> 01:27:06,884
and you acted like a
fuckin' spoiled brat.

1306
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:07,919
No wonder she left us...-Hey!

1307
01:27:08,053 --> 01:27:09,421
Watch your mouth.

1308
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:13,659
Oh, shit!

1309
01:27:19,632 --> 01:27:21,634
Peri, babe, um,

1310
01:27:21,766 --> 01:27:22,800
let's go to the bathroom, okay?

1311
01:27:22,934 --> 01:27:23,768
- What?
- Nothin', just

1312
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:25,037
Hold on.

1313
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:27,039
Here, just clean that up.

1314
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:39,551
Hey, Peri?

1315
01:27:40,818 --> 01:27:42,087
You alright in there?

1316
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:45,823
Peri?

1317
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:48,926
For shame, hippies,

1318
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:53,098
how dare you slander
our Commander-in-Chief?

1319
01:27:54,799 --> 01:27:56,335
I brought supplies.

1320
01:27:56,468 --> 01:27:57,336
Come on in.

1321
01:27:59,003 --> 01:28:01,540
Peri, it's Pastor Gail.

1322
01:28:01,674 --> 01:28:03,007
Can I come in?

1323
01:28:05,277 --> 01:28:06,278
Peri?

1324
01:28:12,618 --> 01:28:16,355
Hey.

1325
01:28:16,488 --> 01:28:18,257
How are you feelin'?

1326
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:19,291
Crampy.

1327
01:28:19,425 --> 01:28:23,729
I got you somethin' for that.

1328
01:28:23,861 --> 01:28:26,465
A hot water bottle. And

1329
01:28:28,634 --> 01:28:30,402
some candy.

1330
01:28:30,536 --> 01:28:33,238
Anda magazine.

1331
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:40,713
I also brought a bunch of pads.
All different shapes and sizes.

1332
01:28:40,845 --> 01:28:42,614
You wanna see?

1333
01:28:42,748 --> 01:28:43,981
Sure.

1334
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:45,850
Do you remember Goldilocks?

1335
01:28:45,983 --> 01:28:48,253
Yeah, kinda.

1336
01:28:48,387 --> 01:28:51,523
Well, so imagine
that Goldilocks

1337
01:28:51,657 --> 01:28:54,360
just got her first period.

1338
01:28:54,493 --> 01:28:58,364
This maxi pad is for
when she bleeds a lot.

1339
01:28:59,832 --> 01:29:02,468
This medium-sized pad, here,

1340
01:29:02,601 --> 01:29:05,404
is for when she bleeds
a medium amount.

1341
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:09,541
And this pantyliner is
for when she bleeds

1342
01:29:09,675 --> 01:29:10,942
A little?

1343
01:29:11,076 --> 01:29:13,345
Good! You'll get
this down in no time.

1344
01:29:15,414 --> 01:29:17,949
Pastor Gail, am I
gonna get pregnant now?

1345
01:29:18,083 --> 01:29:20,586
Peri, you can't get
pregnant without

1346
01:29:22,855 --> 01:29:27,126
Well, there's some other
stuff that has to happen.

1347
01:29:27,259 --> 01:29:28,861
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1348
01:29:28,993 --> 01:29:31,263
Yeah.

1349
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:33,898
Would you like a hug?

1350
01:29:45,043 --> 01:29:45,977
Here.

1351
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:47,279
She says put that on your tummy.

1352
01:29:55,454 --> 01:29:57,756
She has everything she needs?

1353
01:29:57,890 --> 01:30:01,093
Yeah, but of all the days

1354
01:30:02,428 --> 01:30:04,229
I just really wish
her mom was here.

1355
01:30:05,697 --> 01:30:07,099
Here, Peri.

1356
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,001
You know
what they say, though:

1357
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:14,939
"God works in mysterious ways
His wonders to perform."

1358
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:19,010
You holdin' out on me?

1359
01:30:19,144 --> 01:30:20,312
Oh, come on.

1360
01:30:21,413 --> 01:30:23,749
Prison'll either turn you
into a lifelong believer

1361
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:25,350
or a lifelong non-believer.

1362
01:30:25,484 --> 01:30:29,054
Yeah. For me,
it was the first.

1363
01:30:30,823 --> 01:30:32,990
Get the fuck outta here!

1364
01:30:33,125 --> 01:30:34,426
Story for another day.

1365
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,561
Yeah, I'll say.

1366
01:30:37,028 --> 01:30:40,032
Hey, believer or not,

1367
01:30:40,165 --> 01:30:41,667
you're a gift to this family.

1368
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,901
I don't know about that.

1369
01:30:43,035 --> 01:30:46,238
Just let me have
this one, okay?

1370
01:30:46,371 --> 01:30:48,005
Thanks for comin'.

1371
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:52,244
Thanks for askin'.

1372
01:31:44,062 --> 01:31:45,029
Dolores?

1373
01:31:45,163 --> 01:31:48,901
Way? Go outside.

1374
01:31:49,034 --> 01:31:50,669
What, why?

1375
01:31:50,802 --> 01:31:54,072
Just go, hurry!
Go outside.

1376
01:31:54,206 --> 01:31:57,242
Gimme a minute.

1377
01:31:59,778 --> 01:32:01,079
I did it, baby!

1378
01:32:01,213 --> 01:32:03,682
I watched the sun set
on Sunset Boulevard,

1379
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:07,085
and I stayed up all night,
like we said.

1380
01:32:07,219 --> 01:32:08,420
How much you been drinkin'?

1381
01:32:08,554 --> 01:32:10,255
Shh, just
look at the sky.

1382
01:32:10,389 --> 01:32:13,492
Can you see the
sun where you are?

1383
01:32:13,625 --> 01:32:15,661
Yeah, I see it.

1384
01:32:15,794 --> 01:32:17,362
We're watching
the sunrise together.

1385
01:32:17,496 --> 01:32:19,097
You ready to come home now?

1386
01:32:20,198 --> 01:32:21,567
I don't know.

1387
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,802
I have to see if I'm
gonna get this gig or not.

1388
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:25,237
What gig?

1389
01:32:26,305 --> 01:32:27,639
What gig, Dolores?

1390
01:32:27,773 --> 01:32:29,308
Workin'
at this dive bar,

1391
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:31,577
takin' over this girl's
maternity leave.

1392
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:36,081
I mean, I don't wanna jinx it,
but it's my dream job, Way.

1393
01:32:36,214 --> 01:32:38,283
Workin' at a fuckin' bar?

1394
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:39,718
It's not just any bar.

1395
01:32:39,851 --> 01:32:41,520
And... the tips

1396
01:32:41,653 --> 01:32:44,323
We are gonna take the
kids to Disneyland!

1397
01:32:46,491 --> 01:32:48,527
Yeah, you take 'em.

1398
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:50,395
I ain't goin' no fuckin' where.

1399
01:32:53,966 --> 01:32:58,637
I loved you so much
when we were younger.

1400
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:02,075
I loved you because
you wanted to get out

1401
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:04,176
just as much as I did.

1402
01:33:05,877 --> 01:33:07,879
And then you just went.
I mean, you went away,

1403
01:33:08,013 --> 01:33:09,982
and you kinda did it without me.

1404
01:33:10,115 --> 01:33:11,583
I did what?

1405
01:33:11,717 --> 01:33:13,652
What did I go and do, Dolores?

1406
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:18,757
And now you're
back, all of a sudden,

1407
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:22,961
and I just feel like
I'm, like, 18 again...

1408
01:33:23,096 --> 01:33:25,263
Yeah,
don't kid yourself, darlin'.

1409
01:33:27,332 --> 01:33:29,468
Yeah, you're right,
I shouldn't kid myself.

1410
01:33:31,903 --> 01:33:35,440
But don't kid yourself either
because I'm a package deal now.

1411
01:33:35,574 --> 01:33:40,512
You know that? Me, and
Denim, and Peri, and Dodger.

1412
01:33:40,646 --> 01:33:43,116
We are a fuckin' package deal.

1413
01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:46,085
Then what the fuck
you doin' in LA?

1414
01:33:46,218 --> 01:33:48,420
I'm makin' good, baby.

1415
01:33:48,553 --> 01:33:51,256
You just wait and
see, I'm makin' good.

1416
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:57,663
Will you give 'em a
kiss for me?

1417
01:33:57,796 --> 01:33:59,431
Alright.

1418
01:33:59,564 --> 01:34:01,166
- Bye.
- Bye.

1419
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,518
What are you doin' up?

1420
01:34:19,651 --> 01:34:21,920
Jumping on my trampoline!

1421
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:25,158
You want some breakfast?

1422
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:26,491
Yeah!

1423
01:34:37,369 --> 01:34:38,570
Hey.

1424
01:34:42,874 --> 01:34:45,210
Got those bank
statements I asked for?

1425
01:34:45,343 --> 01:34:47,446
No, sir.

1426
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:49,414
I need to ask a favor from you.

1427
01:34:51,016 --> 01:34:53,052
I already let you move
in with your girlfriend.

1428
01:34:53,186 --> 01:34:55,487
That was your one.

1429
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,422
I need a pass to
leave the state.

1430
01:34:57,556 --> 01:34:58,890
What, you and the Prez
got some business

1431
01:34:59,024 --> 01:34:59,991
over down by the border?

1432
01:35:00,126 --> 01:35:04,296
No. I'm takin' the kids to LA.

1433
01:35:04,429 --> 01:35:07,332
LA, huh? What's in LA?

1434
01:35:07,466 --> 01:35:09,334
Their mom.

1435
01:35:09,468 --> 01:35:10,836
She's been workin' down there.

1436
01:35:10,969 --> 01:35:15,841
Sh... She's makin' good money,
actually, but, uh

1437
01:35:15,974 --> 01:35:17,909
We miss her.

1438
01:35:18,044 --> 01:35:19,178
You know how many
people come in here

1439
01:35:19,311 --> 01:35:20,746
with some sob story?

1440
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:23,815
Their grandmother in Wyoming
lost her false teeth,

1441
01:35:23,949 --> 01:35:26,752
or their fucking dog
needs a vacation.

1442
01:35:26,885 --> 01:35:30,089
And when they go missing,
my ass is on the line.

1443
01:35:30,223 --> 01:35:31,090
You have a hard job.

1444
01:35:31,224 --> 01:35:32,324
Don't...

1445
01:35:32,457 --> 01:35:36,294
No, I'm not. I'm
not bein' funny.

1446
01:35:36,428 --> 01:35:38,396
There's a lot of us out there,

1447
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:41,867
lost and can't find
their way back.

1448
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,869
I wouldn't wanna deal
with that either.

1449
01:35:51,244 --> 01:35:54,412
Fill out that form. I
need the when, where, why.

1450
01:35:54,546 --> 01:35:56,115
Be specific, no bullshit.

1451
01:35:56,249 --> 01:35:57,883
It'll take about
a couple of weeks

1452
01:35:58,016 --> 01:35:58,884
before it's approved.

1453
01:35:59,017 --> 01:36:00,318
Yes, sir.

1454
01:36:17,836 --> 01:36:20,173
Wayland, how old
is this thing anyway?

1455
01:36:20,305 --> 01:36:21,640
I dunno,
older than me.

1456
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:23,909
I'm
amazed it still runs.

1457
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:28,080
You know what?

1458
01:36:28,214 --> 01:36:29,282
I'm proud of her.

1459
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:30,949
Why?

1460
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:32,851
She didn't just sit
around and hate on her life.

1461
01:36:32,984 --> 01:36:34,553
She made a play.

1462
01:36:34,686 --> 01:36:36,822
You mean she ran away.

1463
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:41,393
Shouldn't we
tell her we're coming

1464
01:36:41,526 --> 01:36:43,962
in case she throws,
like, a crazy fit?

1465
01:36:45,564 --> 01:36:49,434
No, we gotta surprise
her, like Dad said.

1466
01:36:49,568 --> 01:36:52,971
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to call you Dad, Wayland.

1467
01:36:56,142 --> 01:36:57,509
That's alright.

1468
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:01,913
You can call me
that if you want.

1469
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:13,892
You ever been to
the ocean, Peri?

1470
01:37:14,025 --> 01:37:16,561
Me? Nah, not me.

1471
01:37:16,695 --> 01:37:19,831
I've been once, but I
was too chicken to swim.

1472
01:37:21,433 --> 01:37:23,368
I'm thinkin' we take a detour.

1473
01:37:23,501 --> 01:37:24,836
To the ocean?

1474
01:37:25,704 --> 01:37:27,106
Yeah, get our feet wet.

1475
01:37:30,375 --> 01:37:31,443
Wow!

1476
01:37:31,576 --> 01:37:33,678
Oh, my God!

1477
01:37:33,812 --> 01:37:35,181
Pacific Ocean, everybody.

1478
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:37,449
It's humongous!

1479
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:21,660
Ooh! Ooh!

1480
01:39:19,484 --> 01:39:21,120
Hey, Dodger
Stadium, that's me!

1481
01:39:34,966 --> 01:39:37,136
It's kinda dirty.

1482
01:39:38,737 --> 01:39:39,838
Denim, look, the
statue's waving at us!

1483
01:39:39,971 --> 01:39:41,240
Hi! Hi!

1484
01:39:50,483 --> 01:39:52,550
Jesus.

1485
01:39:53,918 --> 01:39:55,121
Alright, this is us!

1486
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,529
Hey, Wayland!
Come on, what you waitin' on?

1487
01:40:38,963 --> 01:40:40,466
Y'all go in without me.

1488
01:40:40,598 --> 01:40:43,402
Wait, you want us to
go in there by ourselves?

1489
01:40:43,536 --> 01:40:44,736
Yeah.

1490
01:40:46,971 --> 01:40:50,509
I did my job.
I got you here.

1491
01:40:50,642 --> 01:40:51,910
It's between you
and your mom now.

1492
01:40:52,044 --> 01:40:54,113
No, you and her
are a thing too.

1493
01:40:55,347 --> 01:40:56,315
Were.

1494
01:40:56,449 --> 01:40:57,550
We were a thing.

1495
01:40:57,682 --> 01:40:59,951
That was a long
time ago. I don't

1496
01:41:00,086 --> 01:41:01,554
I don't even know
what we are anymore.

1497
01:41:01,686 --> 01:41:04,656
No! You don't get to bail
whenever you feel like it.

1498
01:41:04,789 --> 01:41:05,957
It's not how it works
when you have kids.

1499
01:41:06,092 --> 01:41:09,228
Yeah, unless you're Lola.

1500
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:11,397
You let Denim call you
Dad, for fuck's sake.

1501
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,730
Yeah

1502
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,336
But we don't share
the same blood.

1503
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:20,039
'Specially me, right?

1504
01:41:24,642 --> 01:41:27,946
Look, without blood,

1505
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,849
we don't have any
rights to each other.

1506
01:41:30,982 --> 01:41:32,717
And no matter what I do,
that's not gonna change,

1507
01:41:32,851 --> 01:41:34,286
you know, so

1508
01:41:34,420 --> 01:41:36,055
Yeah, Denim can call
me Dad all he wants,

1509
01:41:36,188 --> 01:41:38,090
but what happens when
he changes his mind?

1510
01:41:38,224 --> 01:41:39,158
I'm not gonna.

1511
01:41:39,291 --> 01:41:40,292
Or I do?

1512
01:41:42,128 --> 01:41:44,163
There's your
fuckin' blood, Wayland!

1513
01:41:44,296 --> 01:41:46,165
Dodger,
what'd you just do?

1514
01:41:53,838 --> 01:41:56,308
Come here,
come here. Shh.

1515
01:41:58,043 --> 01:41:59,044
Hey!

1516
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:07,153
I'm so sorry.

1517
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:03,741
Hello, I'm Coral.
I'll be your hostess.

1518
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:05,110
Wow!

1519
01:43:05,244 --> 01:43:06,045
Wait

1520
01:43:06,178 --> 01:43:08,681
I know you. You're Denim.

1521
01:43:08,813 --> 01:43:10,014
Nice to meet ya.

1522
01:43:11,383 --> 01:43:14,587
And Periwinkle, you are more
prettier than the flower.

1523
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:18,923
Dodger, you and LA are
positively meant to be together.

1524
01:43:19,058 --> 01:43:22,228
And Wayland, of course.
Always Wayland

1525
01:43:24,563 --> 01:43:25,664
She didn't say you'd be here.

1526
01:43:25,797 --> 01:43:27,032
It's a surprise.

1527
01:43:27,166 --> 01:43:28,300
Who was it that said,

1528
01:43:28,434 --> 01:43:30,202
"There is no surprise
more wonderful

1529
01:43:30,336 --> 01:43:33,539
than the surprise
of being loved?"

1530
01:43:33,672 --> 01:43:34,973
Now, what can I get you?

1531
01:43:36,141 --> 01:43:38,611
Three soda waters
and a cup of ice.

1532
01:43:38,743 --> 01:43:41,046
Comin' up. And Denim

1533
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,648
Keep
rockin' those dresses.

1534
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,949
I will, I promise!

1535
01:43:49,622 --> 01:43:51,190
Hey, Coral?

1536
01:43:51,323 --> 01:43:52,191
Where's Dolores?

1537
01:43:52,324 --> 01:43:54,025
She'll be up in
a minute, sugar.

1538
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:17,483
Ladies and gentlemen,
the mermaid Aquarius!

1539
01:44:22,421 --> 01:44:25,057
Please place your tips
inside the mermaid tip jar.

1540
01:44:28,494 --> 01:44:30,696
- Got your drinks.
- Thanks.

1541
01:44:30,828 --> 01:44:31,963
Just the ice, thank you.

1542
01:44:32,097 --> 01:44:33,065
Here you go.
Here, honey.

1543
01:44:36,335 --> 01:44:37,969
Up next, our newest mermaid.

1544
01:44:38,103 --> 01:44:39,438
She's gotten tired
of living on land,

1545
01:44:39,571 --> 01:44:41,906
so she swapped her
legs out for a tail.

1546
01:44:42,041 --> 01:44:44,677
Let's hear it forLorelei!

1547
01:44:58,823 --> 01:45:00,892
That's Lola.

1548
01:45:01,025 --> 01:45:02,561
She's beautiful

1549
01:45:29,822 --> 01:45:32,558
Lola! Lola! Mom!

1550
01:45:52,745 --> 01:45:54,546
Where'd she go?

1551
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,015
It's okay, she just
went up to get some air.

1552
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:26,580
