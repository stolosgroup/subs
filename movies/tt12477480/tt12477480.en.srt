1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:01,296
.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,030
Murders were thick on the ground.

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,320
Is it because the weather
is good these days?

5
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm happy.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,160
We've got to catch one of them.

7
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,430
But the director and the team
pretended they didn't hear.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,170
What do we do?

9
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,360
We should do it.

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,289
- We?
- Yes.

11
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,110
You and me.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,660
Lee Ji-Goo came here alone

13
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,860
last year and asked for a
refund of the prepaid coupon?

14
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,890
Yeah, right?

15
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,229
It wasn't allowed.

16
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,455
I said I'd ask my boss

17
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,930
and then I texted you, Officer.

18
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,190
That's a great job.

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,400
I showed you pictures a long time ago.

20
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,289
It just popped into my mind.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
Did he say he will come again?

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,820
(OPPA INTERNET CAFE)

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,140
Are you happy to go home
without me on the weekend?

24
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,050
Are you staying with me now?

25
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,050
Then let's get married soon.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,780
- You dozed off again.
- I just stop talking.

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,910
Keep talking.

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,990
That's why you should sleep
a little more tonight.

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,760
What if it's dangerous?

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,260
You don't get enough sleep

31
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,805
because you spend all day
doing latent work.

32
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,110
It's not that I can't sleep.
It's just that I don't sleep.

33
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,686
I couldn't sleep, so I lurked there.

34
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,630
Why didn't you catch Lee Ji-Goo and
Hong San-Oh three years ago?

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,690
Are there many people staying
in the dormitory on weekends?

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,040
He's busy because of the
Olympic math competition.

37
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,891
Why does a junior high school
student competing like that?

38
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,670
He's a science major, so he take after me.

39
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,640
I totally understand him.

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
It'd be nice to order any sushi.

41
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,670
I don't want to eat that inauthentic sushi.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,140
I want to cook you something hot
when I'm around.

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,260
Can't you transfer to Lipo?

44
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,120
I want to have hot soup every day.

45
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,686
Our neighbor, Samantha.

46
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,180
Yeah.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,191
She's pretending to be worried about me,
but secretly embarrassing me.

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,286
She said,

49
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:21,120
Six of the couples were seriously considering
divorce over the weekend and asked me if I'm okay.

50
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,370
So what did you said?

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,720
I say 55% of sexless couples
get divorced and asked her if she's okay.

52
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,710
(DECISION TO LEAVE)

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,550
After grabbing the rope and
climbed to the top of the mountain,

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,570
I think it was when he fell off the
top of the mountain and hit it.

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Up there, over there, here, and here.

56
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,680
Wearing an expensive headphones.

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,690
Ten o'clock, Monday.

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,360
We'd better go up.

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,209
Is the helicopter coming?

60
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,660
I heard it's okay to walk.
Why do we have to go this way?

61
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,470
Because it's the way how the
dead have died, and we are the police.

62
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,326
Then, are we going to fall
when coming down?

63
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,670
Will we collide three times?

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Why does anyone need to
climb rock like this?

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,170
Shouldn't it be prohibited by law?

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,580
Oh, it really hurts.

67
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,530
Ah, I got it.

68
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,910
60-year-old Kim Do-Soo's belongings
are engraved with initials.

69
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,970
He drunk soju.

70
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,159
And whiskey.

71
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Please don't go near the cliff!

72
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,566
He retired after working as a civil servant
at the Immigration and Foreign Affairs Agency,

73
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,440
and until his death, he was
still there with the Minger interviewer.

74
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,790
It opened.

75
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,240
His daughter is charming.

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,760
Will you be able to open it that easily?

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,010
You dad's over here.

78
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm Song Seo-Rae, Ki Do-Soo's wife.

79
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,240
I can't speak Korean
enough because I'm Chinese.

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,580
You must be quite shocked.

81
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,640
I was worried

82
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,340
If he climb up the mountain
and don't come back.

83
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,190
I'm afraid he'll die. At last.

84
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,450
At last.

85
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,010
You speak Korean better than I do.

86
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
I want to know the pattern.

87
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,420
Her husband died and
said she wasn't shocked.

88
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,360
What an amazing wife.

89
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Go and tell her that an autopsy is required

90
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,290
for a dead person who has no witnesses.

91
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,640
Put it in a nutshell.

92
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
I don't think my wife will be scared.

93
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,040
She would say,
"I knew it would be like this",

94
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,640
"That's why I don't want to marry a cop".

95
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,700
A person who died for unknown reasons
in a place where no one saw him.

96
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,710
We need to open the body
and examine him.

97
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
That's the rule.

98
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,720
No, it is an order.

99
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,650
Is it easier if I say it like that?

100
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,980
More easily.

101
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,635
I told her to call the police.

102
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,116
I asked her if she could still laugh
when she saw the fracture.

103
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,850
And she still wanted to laugh.

104
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
This woman's body is very clean.

105
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,179
She's wounded in
places that are out of sight.

106
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Wait a minute. Give me the mouse.

107
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,510
What does my husband look
like in real life?

108
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:03,240
Should I tell you in words?
Or do you want to see in pictures?

109
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
Tell me.

110
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
No, pictures.

111
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,100
He was found with his eyes open,
do you want to see it?

112
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,770
Head laceration is the
immediate cause of death.

113
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,850
It's a crack in the head that killed him.

114
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,830
There should have been a lot of blood but
it was raining so it was washed away.

115
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,560
It's a blessing that he died
the way he wanted to.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Isn't it fate?

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you see her laugh?

118
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,490
He's a clean guy.

119
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,420
There's nowhere to go.

120
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,420
Just let me die like this.

121
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,660
That's cruel.

122
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,230
Am I that bad?

123
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,490
Am I so wicked?

124
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,830
We're good, right?

125
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Yeah.

126
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,760
We have been very happy for
16 years and 8 months.

127
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,430
How can you count that?

128
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,340
As expected of science major.

129
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,440
They say sex is good for high blood
pressure and heart disease.

130
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,940
I read the latest research that says
it's good for cognitive function too.

131
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,510
Oh, here we go again.

132
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,220
We're gonna do it every week.

133
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,710
Even when we hate each other.

134
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,960
So vicious.

135
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,900
You were just thinking
about that, weren't you?

136
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,880
The Gilgok-dong incident.

137
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,850
No.

138
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,236
It's the case incident

139
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,660
of a young Chinese woman
whose husband died in the mountains.

140
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,280
I feel bad for her husband.

141
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,160
Seo-Rae goes to different elderly people
that are living alone from Monday to Friday.

142
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
You asked Monday, right?

143
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,666
Our patients may not be
able to express themselves very well,

144
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,160
So the person in charge
will call one by one.

145
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,670
Yes, 9 a.m... come here.

146
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,490
I can check if the caretaker

147
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,200
is there or not.

148
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,540
Song Seo-Rae.

149
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,310
Monday... oh, it's
grandmother Lee Hae-Dong?

150
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,160
I also called to confirm that day.

151
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,200
I'm sorry but

152
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,860
Can someone who can't express
their feelings answer the phone?

153
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,650
Of course the caretaker picked it up.

154
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,180
How's Song Seo-Rae doing?

155
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,310
That's what our grandmothers said.

156
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,420
Is she a nurse or a granddaughter?

157
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,206
Because she is a nurse,
she is very good at injections.

158
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,300
It's our company's ace. It's our ace.

159
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,500
She's a horrible woman.

160
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
Look at her. She's taken the ring off.

161
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,706
Isn't it sadness hits people like waves?

162
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,760
Just like the ink spreads, there will also
be people who are slowly getting stained.

163
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,856
Let me know when you will
publish your book of poems.

164
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,060
I'll buy one.

165
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,190
Do you understand the bitterness of life?

166
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,176
Right?

167
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,550
You spend bitter weekends
with a beautiful wife.

168
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,556
After sitting for 12 hours all day,

169
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,410
Screening out illegal
immigrants is hard work.

170
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,056
But the thought of climbing a mountain

171
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,130
completely changes my mind.

172
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,370
- Then...
- Come on.

173
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,880
They found someone else's DNA
under Ki Do-Soo's fingernails.

174
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,700
We need to collect the epithelial cells
from her wife's mouth first.

175
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,560
Ah, this oral epithelial cells word.

176
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,070
How do we explain that to her?

177
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,656
When I think of something
that's giving me a headache,

178
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,710
All of a sudden, all of my
gastrointestinal cells started to hurt.

179
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,860
Go and eat. Don't buy expensive food.

180
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,030
Really...

181
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,256
They found

182
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,320
someone else's DNA
under Ki Do-Soo's fingernails.

183
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,090
Now, come to the police station
and give us some DNA.

184
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
I can't.

185
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,606
Why not?

186
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,020
I'm working.

187
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,460
Your husband's dead.

188
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,260
Looks like you're back at work.

189
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,646
My dead husband

190
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,380
must not get in the way of
caring for the living elderly.

191
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
Ah, I see.

192
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,646
Ah, tracking is my main specialty.

193
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,366
I heard that you grew up in the hands of grandma,
so I entrusted Monday grandmother to you.

194
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,390
Do it well.

195
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,880
What time did Song Seo-Rae come on Monday?

196
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,996
Siri, play a song.

197
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,860
Jung Hoon Hee's Mist.

198
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,640
The song is great.

199
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,110
I got it from Seo-Rae.

200
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:43,890
♫ I WALK ALONE ON THIS FOGGY STREET ♫

201
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,630
♫ ONE DAY ♫

202
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Open your mouth.

203
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,970
I thought you couldn't come.

204
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,569
Thank you.

205
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,030
What do you like about Seo-Rae?

206
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,190
Because she's beautiful?

207
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,550
Because she peeled apples skin
very thinly.

208
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,720
I've been praying since Friday night
to make Monday come faster.

209
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,740
That way, sometimes I think
Monday really comes soon.

210
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,820
Sidi, play a song.

211
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,430
Jung Hoon Hee's Mist.

212
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,530
Isn't the song good?

213
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,250
I got it from Seo-Rae.

214
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,070
We fought.

215
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,420
My husband wants to climb the mountains.

216
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,110
I hate mountains.

217
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,850
Did he scratch you

218
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,070
because you were against
your husband's climbing the mountain?

219
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,260
I'll call a policewoman.

220
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,680
It's okay.

221
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,950
I need to take a picture.

222
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,810
It's okay.

223
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,570
It's okay.

224
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,340
I did it.

225
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,600
Because he doesn't
understand my Korean.

226
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,190
After you hurt yourself,

227
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,330
did he understand?

228
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
At last.

229
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,590
What did your husband say
when he saw you hurt yourself?

230
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,380
So vicious.

231
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,920
Do-Soo is stopping me like this.

232
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,790
The DNA discovered under your
husband's fingernails is therefore yours.

233
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Is it?

234
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,206
Yes.

235
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,750
You hate mountains that much, Seo-Rae?

236
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:39,930
Confucius said, "The wise love the water,
the benevolence the mountains."

237
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,790
I am not benevolent.

238
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,510
I like the sea.

239
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
Yes, me too.

240
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Yes?

241
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,760
These are the dates you go to
the emergency room, right?

242
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,660
Is that because you don't want him
to go to the mountains and beat you up?

243
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,690
He is the only Korean

244
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,170
who shed tears after hearing my story.

245
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,750
What kind of Korean?

246
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,670
The only one...

247
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
Kor...

248
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,330
Ah, I'm sorry.

249
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,550
I shouldn't laugh.

250
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,500
Because you are too explicit.

251
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,100
When I'm not confident
in speaking Korean,

252
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,920
I laugh.

253
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,370
Have a sit.

254
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,950
I'll buy you a dinner.

255
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,150
How's it going? Everything alright?

256
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,330
Thank you.

257
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,580
Did you eat well?

258
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
No.

259
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,830
That...

260
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,570
Is that a sushi deluxe set meal?

261
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,550
Can it be reimbursed?

262
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,350
Please follow me.

263
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,660
We'll be back again.

264
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,360
It's waterproof.

265
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,520
Waterproof means even if it is wet,

266
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,450
the water can't get in.

267
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,490
Nurses use a lot of waterproof products.

268
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,600
I see.

269
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,456
Come back to that room by 6:50.

270
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,690
This way to the ladies'
restroom, to the right.

271
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,390
August 17, 2015.

272
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,460
The Coast Guard found a
Chinese illegal immigrants

273
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,870
on a cargo ship coming
from Pyeongtaek Port.

274
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,660
Thirty-seven others were deported.

275
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,530
You were the only one left here.

276
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,880
Because I'm not like everyone else.

277
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,820
My maternal grandfather...

278
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,660
is Gae Bong-Seok of the
Manchurian Korean Liberation Army.

279
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,270
What?

280
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,500
- Wh-what did she say?
- Hmm?

281
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,770
Thanks to Ki Do-Soo, he got the
Order of Merit for National Foundation.

282
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,976
(Nationality Certificate Presentation Ceremony for
Persons of Distinguished Service to Independence)

283
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This is me.

284
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,410
All right, we'll be there in ten minutes.

285
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,550
Lee Ji-Goo appeared
at Oppa Internet cafe.

286
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,196
Roger.

287
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,400
Release Song Seo-Rae.

288
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,400
Go and investigate Gae Bong-Seok that won
the Order of Merit for National Foundation.

289
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Yes, sir.

290
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,240
(OPPA INTERNET CAFE)

291
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,310
Goodness.

292
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,510
Even if you don't use it,
you'll feel safe with it.

293
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:08,930
Come here.

294
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:09,970
Lee Ji-Goo!

295
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,830
Fuck.

296
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,796
Gae Bong-Seok.

297
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,860
- Lee Ji-Goo!

298
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,250
In the mid-1930s,

299
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,760
he served as a company commander
of the Korean Liberation Army,

300
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,160
which actively engaged in
the anti-Japanese armed war.

301
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,810
More than 200 military
operations, large and small,

302
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,220
have been carried out
by wildcats known as Nammanju.

303
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,416
In Yanbian, China, the
legend of being beheaded

304
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,126
for biting the company
commander's neck

305
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,160
in a surprise attack on the
Japanese army has been handed down.

306
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,310
Lee Ji-Goo, you son of a bitch!

307
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,810
I'm done. I think I'm dying!

308
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Goddamn it.

309
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Let go.

310
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,870
I said let go.

311
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,810
Let go.

312
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,706
Oh? Why is it so dark in here?

313
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,730
What are you doing?

314
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,630
Come on, get up.

315
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,430
Why did you fall?

316
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,630
Get out.

317
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,530
It wasn't you, right?

318
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,830
Fighting with you,
I see that you can't kill a person.

319
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
Bo-Mi.

320
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,400
San-Oh killed him, right?

321
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,620
You guys won't catch San-Oh.

322
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,580
Why?

323
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,310
Because San-Oh's memories are so beautiful.

324
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,350
Rather than getting
caught and going to jail,

325
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,660
He would choose to kill the
police and then kill himself.

326
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,820
He have the urge to commit suicide.

327
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,140
Didn't I told you not to commit violence?

328
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,370
Didn't a policeman get injured? Policeman.

329
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,720
I injured myself because I beated him.

330
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,800
What's the use of running
around with a gun?

331
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,730
You're out of breath and unable to run.

332
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,830
Also,

333
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,726
you have to let the
suspect speak for himself.

334
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,010
Why are you keep on talking?

335
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,640
Aren't you listening too much
to the suspect?

336
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,906
- Take Song Seo-Rae for example.
- What?

337
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,876
We should've summoned the suspect,
and the warrant's issued.

338
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,060
The police officer who did the work, Mi-ji,
brought in the surveillance footage.

339
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,110
Song Seo-Rae was caught entering
and leaving in grandmother's house.

340
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,650
This alibi is the proof.

341
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,830
Hello, Mi-Ji.

342
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,190
Didn't you say that
Hong San-Oh has a lot of women?

343
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,840
Type up the list.

344
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,990
Like dates and special events.

345
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,510
We're tracking the address
and attaching it to it.

346
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,090
Why would such a beautiful woman
marry that old man and live in Korea?

347
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,310
Just because

348
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,420
you're young, beautiful, and foreign,
do you want to become a suspect?

349
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,700
So you admit she's pretty.

350
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,410
It's reverse discrimination.

351
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,796
If the other person is not a
woman or a foreigner,

352
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,960
If it's just a Korean guy, the team
leader would have go lurking right away.

353
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,490
Isn't you're interest in lurking?

354
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,540
What a chatterbox.

355
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,510
She didn't put ice cream in the fridge.

356
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,890
Sleep uncomfortably with the TV on.

357
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,110
Good morning.

358
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,720
Good morning.

359
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,576
Why are you saying
'good morning' all of a sudden?

360
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,030
You make people flustered.

361
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,460
Anyway, I have slept well. I slept well.

362
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Meow.

363
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,130
You gave me crow again
because I gave you food?

364
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,390
Forget it.

365
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,820
If you have to give me a present,

366
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,360
Bring me the heart of
that kind detective.

367
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,320
I kind of want to.

368
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,620
Eating ice cream again for dinner.

369
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,010
It's not okay to smoke after a meal.

370
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,370
Crying... at last.

371
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,320
Good morning!

372
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,300
Good morning.

373
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
The Geumjeongsan incident case,

374
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,139
Are you still chasing her?

375
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,070
Hurry up and get the case closed and
strive for greater victory,

376
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,659
like the Chilgok-dong incident.

377
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,126
Goodness.

378
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,050
- Please come back again.
- Goodbye.

379
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,960
I heard the Geumjeongsan
case is going to be closed.

380
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,920
What is this Chinese document?

381
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,670
Isn't the investigation over yet?

382
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,120
But there's nothing
suspicious of the suspect.

383
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,046
I want to catch a murderer

384
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,200
in Chilgok-dong area now.

385
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,570
It was Song Seo-Rae's murder suspect who
returned to China with at least a life sentence.

386
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:14,890
I even gave you the translation. See?

387
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,790
You.

388
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,220
Hong San-Oh met several girlfriends.

389
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,480
See the report within two days.

390
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,760
Ah, that's just now...

391
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,330
Hey.

392
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,830
Ah, look at it again.

393
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,320
She killed her mother.

394
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,070
It's so cold, what are you doing outside?

395
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,950
I like the idea of a foggy sea.

396
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,860
Even if I go to Busan, there's a sea.

397
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,386
Going to Lipo, there's a sea.

398
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,056
I am the man of the sea.

399
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,110
Your mouth is full of sea.
Isn't your hometown inland?

400
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
Ah, I want to smoke.

401
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,900
We need to get rid of that
before it's too late.

402
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,780
I'll go find dried bellflower.

403
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,810
Didn't you chew that to quit cigarette?

404
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,660
Hello, Lee Ju-rim. It's me.

405
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:22,600
Do you have dried bellflower there?

406
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,770
My husband wants to smoke again.

407
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,900
It's all used up when he quit.

408
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,106
Just this once.

409
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:35,000
(Seo-Rae)

410
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,990
(Detective Jang Hae-Joon
WHAT DO YOU THINK.)

411
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,872
(COME TO MY HOUSE.)

412
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,290
Ah, really.

413
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,240
Why are you calling a police
office to come to you house?

414
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,850
You come here often anyway, don't you?

415
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,070
It is said that you killed your mother.

416
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,740
Homi mountain is

417
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,970
you grandfather's hometown in Korea.

418
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,900
Your grandfather.

419
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,520
Go there and visit him on the mountain

420
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,660
Yes.

421
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,820
Kill me first

422
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,400
I want

423
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,780
to take care of my mom professionally

424
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,650
that's why I became a nurse.

425
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,480
Just because I'm a nurse

426
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,960
so you're asking me to
kill you professionally?

427
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,260
So I sent her off the
way she expected me to.

428
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,970
Four fentanyl capsules will do.

429
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,160
I got some for myself, too.

430
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,310
Where did you put it? Fentanyl.

431
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:30,390
If you're curious, open it.

432
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,660
Ki Do-Soo committed
suicide and gave this to me.

433
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,896
(I know that you took money and flesh by approaching
Chinese and Russians to help them stay in Korea.

434
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,666
I know that he manipulated the facts so that unqualified people can be naturalized,
and that he has often threatened to deport them if they do not give bribes.

435
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,580
You will lose your credentials and pension as an
interviewer if this becomes known to the world.

436
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:51,437
He will also lose his reputation as a
civil servant who has served 25 years.

437
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,916
(If you don't respond to this letter, I will report
you to the immigration office and the police.)

438
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Okay.

439
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Ki Do-Soo have been

440
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,840
staring at people's faces for more than
20 years and stamping your passport.

441
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,890
Without any expression and a friend.

442
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,440
Why are you with that kind of man...

443
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,400
In the middle of summer,
I was trapped in a barn of boat fish

444
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,230
and drifted at sea for ten days.

445
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,720
My face looks like a skeleton,
and I'm stained with shit and urine.

446
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,350
I stayed there like a crazy person.

447
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,676
He saw me,

448
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,160
smelled me,

449
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,730
and heard my story.

450
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
Does your wife know

451
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,900
that you stare at someone
else's house at night?

452
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,510
I can't live under the stigma
of a corrupt civil servant.

453
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,840
No matter what the cost,
sooner or later

454
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,710
I will prove my innocence.

455
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,450
The police must be responsible for
the suicide note and tell everyone.

456
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,480
Actually, It was my
boss when I was working.

457
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,090
- I see.
- I'm sorry.

458
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,190
Are you sure

459
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,796
it's a suicide note?

460
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,986
You haven't got a suicide note?

461
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,010
You too.

462
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,310
You're no different than any other cop!

463
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,856
How can you be the youngest
police officer in history?

464
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,490
If he's no different than any other cop,
I'm willing to dance.

465
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,550
Of course

466
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,340
the evidence that she killed her mother is
not the evidence that killed her husband.

467
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,420
But didn't you say that?

468
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,100
Killing is like smoking.

469
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,930
Only the first time is hard.

470
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,930
Hello?

471
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,310
I'm sorry.

472
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,270
Hey, Soo-Wan.

473
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,306
Soo-Wan, let's go.

474
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:16,330
Yes.

475
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,730
- Will you?
- Yeah.

476
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,750
Let's go home, rascal.

477
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,206
Hey, hyung.

478
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,230
Get up.

479
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,530
What's going on?

480
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Let's go.

481
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,710
Our group leader

482
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,496
Hey, let's go.

483
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,040
He looks a little wilted, but
he's actually a pretty scary guy.

484
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,666
I'll catch you next time.

485
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,240
Let's go, let's go.

486
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:41,850
The next time you kill your husband,
you have to take care.

487
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,890
Hey.

488
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,386
Hyung, I need to take my bag.

489
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,670
It's okay, it's okay. Let's go.

490
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,366
Go, go, go.

491
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,490
- I've made it simple enough, haven't I?
- Let's go.

492
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,256
I went all the way to come to
Busan because I respect you.

493
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
No, don't do it.

494
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,816
I have one question.

495
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,460
Don't ask.

496
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,380
Why did you treat that woman a sushi?

497
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Crazy.

498
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,320
Seo-Rae, can you move your feet?

499
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,860
The incident case is closed.

500
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,820
Seo-Rae, you're no longer

501
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,550
a suspect.

502
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,350
Are you happy?

503
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
What?

504
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,190
Why would I?

505
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,190
You're right. I'm happy.

506
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,600
Why?

507
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,540
I just think...

508
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,870
We're no longer...

509
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
We?

510
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,520
What?

511
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,580
Have you had dinner yet?

512
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:08,790
What?

513
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,900
Ah, yes.

514
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,940
Ice cream?

515
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,860
The only cuisine I know and I can cook

516
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,620
is a Chinese Cuisine.

517
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,600
I do all sorts of things at night

518
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,080
due to insomnia

519
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,840
Ah, insomnia means you can't sleep.

520
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,880
Oh my... God.

521
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,820
Those are the unsolved cases

522
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,000
but I don't know when
it'll be done so I just...

523
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,550
An unsolved case is a case
that has not been solved.

524
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,930
Unsolved case.

525
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,110
Do ants eat people?

526
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:24,790
Ah, that...

527
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,610
The first thing that comes out is flies

528
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,450
Sooner or later, they'll
be there in ten minutes.

529
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,870
After eating blood and secretions,

530
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:35,590
they'll lay eggs in wounds
or holes in the human body.

531
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,880
If maggots come out of there,

532
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,560
the ants will flock to eat the maggots.

533
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,150
And then the beetles, then wasps.
That's how they start eating humans.

534
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,810
But it tastes good.

535
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:06,640
I gave out a taste award

536
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,840
That's why you can't sleep.

537
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,550
Because of the bloodshot pictures
of the dead are screaming.

538
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,126
That man is Jeon Hyo-seok was found

539
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,450
on the mountain a month after his death.

540
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:24,880
The hand axe that smashed his
own head was next to him.

541
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:26,830
Hong San-Oh.

542
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:30,210
He is the real murderer of the Gilgok-dong
incident, but I can't catch him.

543
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,680
I look at these photos whenever I can.

544
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,550
After interviewing more than
a dozen of his ex-girlfriends,

545
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,090
Now I feel that I've
become very close to him.

546
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,540
Have he been in jail?

547
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,890
Yes, he have only lived for a month.

548
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,950
He mistakenly thought her girlfriend was
going to date another man, so he hit the man.

549
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,710
Is he more afraid of prison than death?

550
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,620
I know.

551
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,606
This guy actually beat someone
with the consciousness of being in jail.

552
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,830
So it's the woman he loves to death.

553
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,460
Oh Ga-In?

554
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,460
He run away.

555
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:33,270
Go after him!

556
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,450
Hyung!

557
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:41,290
The bullets has been rotated!

558
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,040
Oh Ga-In lives far away though.

559
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,520
She opened a beauty salon in Gyeonggi-do.

560
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,230
And she got married.

561
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,070
In South Korea,

562
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,920
Do you stop liking someone you like
when they get married?

563
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,520
Hey, Hong San-Oh!

564
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,340
Hong San-Oh!

565
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,910
Hong...

566
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,190
You.

567
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,620
You didn't kill Bo-Mi for money, did you?

568
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,370
Right? I've know everything.

569
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,480
When you're in jail for a month,

570
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,210
Bo-Mi touched Oh Ga-In, didn't he?

571
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
Actually I...

572
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,400
But her husband beats her.

573
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,410
But the husband beat the woman

574
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,100
I really want to kill her husband.

575
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,380
Why do girls sleep with those trash guys?

576
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,530
I'm a trash too though.

577
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,760
I know!

578
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,570
No, why are you a trash?

579
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,930
You really love Ga-In.

580
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Right?

581
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,240
Didn't you gave up everything
for the sake of Ga-In? Motherfucker.

582
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,260
You gave up...

583
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,960
Please tell Ga-In...

584
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,040
Although I have suffered
a lot because of her

585
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,450
Actually, without her,
my life would be empty.

586
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,520
Please tell her so.

587
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,120
Hong San-Oh!

588
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:41,290
Don't do this!

589
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,780
Looks like you don't need to tell her.

590
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,850
Are you okay?

591
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,990
Which cop will let someone like that
drive home right away?

592
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,786
Do you want me to go to Busan?

593
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,670
No, no, there's no need to come.

594
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,950
But still, whenever you cry, I...

595
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,176
I'm not crying.

596
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,086
Really?

597
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,680
I have to go to the restroom.

598
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,780
Oh, okay.

599
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,100
I'm hanging up.

600
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,590
After persistent inquiry,
they finally found him.

601
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,216
After killing her husband, Mr. Kang,

602
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,450
It has been confirmed that he and Oh
have been living together.

603
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,160
Who is it?

604
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,210
You...

605
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,300
Ah, I told you no need to come...

606
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,860
What's the matter?

607
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,010
Because I want to put you to sleep.

608
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,310
Do you think I'm an old
man who lives alone?

609
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,970
Are you going to squeeze
my arms and shoulders?

610
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
What are you doing?

611
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:54,470
Didn't you say these are unsolved cases?

612
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,760
I'll burn my husband's picture, too

613
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,930
This is too dark.

614
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,070
But still, you're pretty.

615
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,790
What did you say about me?

616
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,600
Try to say it in chinese.

617
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,740
You're pretty.

618
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,640
Then, you can have one.

619
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:50,190
I'll keep this.

620
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,150
This one too.

621
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:57,090
This one too.

622
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:01,410
This is better, isn't it?

623
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,060
Can you get a good night's sleep now?

624
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,060
I'm not sure.

625
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,980
I have a way.

626
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
Way?

627
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:30,380
I upgraded the U.S. Navy development.

628
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,070
I'm from the Navy though.

629
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,240
What has the U.S. Navy developed?

630
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,340
Close your eyes.

631
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:51,720
Do you really want my heart?

632
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,470
Heart?

633
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,160
What are you going to do with my heart?

634
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,840
I mean I'll put you in ease,

635
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,420
not to get your heart.

636
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,860
I see.

637
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,470
Sleep.

638
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,200
Listen to the sound of my breathing.

639
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,330
Align your breathing with my breathing

640
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,180
Now you're going to the sea.

641
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:40,700
You went underwater.

642
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,530
You're a jellyfish.

643
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:52,550
You have no eyes nor nose.

644
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,120
You're not thinking anything as well.

645
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,020
You're not happy

646
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,770
nor sad.

647
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,190
You're emotionless.

648
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,210
You're pushing the water away

649
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,920
Push away everything that happened today

650
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,950
Push it to me.

651
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
Wait.

652
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,740
Korean women have a lot of trouble
with their hands, don't they?

653
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,700
Don't caregivers not use gloves much?

654
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,080
The calluses on your hands are...

655
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,790
I felt good from the start.

656
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,020
Because the cop in
charge of me has a class.

657
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:54,970
Are you saying that being a cop is classy?

658
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,050
As a Korean?

659
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,660
What about boyfriend?

660
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,630
As a modern man.

661
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,400
Seo-Rae, what era are you from?

662
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:16,780
Tang Dynasty?

663
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:21,850
Why don't you ask me why I like you?

664
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,770
If you know, are you afraid of
always thinking about it?

665
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:29,240
I already knew that you and I
were of the same boat.

666
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,240
When I said I wanted to see
your husband's picture

667
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,920
You're saying no

668
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,980
and I always

669
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,580
I will try my best to look good.

670
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:56,230
If you look at the body in the crime scene,
half of the corpses were eyed-open.

671
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,410
I promise I'll catch the last one
they saw with those eyes.

672
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,420
What I'm afraid of is
a crime scene with a lot of blood.

673
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,380
Because of the smell.

674
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,980
That's why you always wear
good-smelling hand cream, isn't it?

675
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,100
Do you have anything else with you?

676
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:53,320
Seo-Rae, what are you afraid of?

677
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,610
Because you're a nurse,
it can't be blood.

678
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,950
Heights.

679
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:58,480
I see.

680
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:02,920
Your pockets...

681
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,160
I have 12 on the jacket and 6 on my pants.

682
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,396
It was made to order at the
store I always go to.

683
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,940
Because I've helped them with cases,
so they give me a discount.

684
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,456
Because I had to go directly to the scene,

685
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,780
I would wear this on my day off.

686
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:16,470
It's not like a person can't kill someone
even if it's a day off, right?

687
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,136
I don't always wear the same clothes,
don't get me wrong.

688
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,136
I have a lot of clothes.

689
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,160
I'm...

690
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,100
a neat person.

691
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,960
She unfold the book and
notebook side by side.

692
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,300
No matter how many hours
she spend, she keep writing.

693
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,270
Even though she's writing,

694
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,660
She often look at her phone.

695
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,170
Or maybe she's looking at a
dictionary for translation.

696
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,030
She's watching drama again.

697
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,560
Talking to herself while watching.

698
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,026
Is it because you watch historical drama

699
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,920
that you speak in an old-fashioned way?

700
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,880
She's eating ice cream again for dinner.

701
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,530
It's not okay to smoke after a meal.

702
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,710
She's crying... at last.

703
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,390
Oh, shit.

704
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,820
I know that's a swear word.

705
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,100
In front of the Buddha, it's really...

706
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,116
You'll delete the recordings

707
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,780
after you solve the incident case, right?

708
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,560
Of course.

709
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,910
You password is the day
your mother died, right?

710
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,430
If you memorize event-related numbers,

711
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,600
There are many times when it's helpful.

712
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,970
Because the case is closed

713
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,520
So I will also forget the case number.

714
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:30,240
♫ I WALK ALONE ON THIS FOGGY STREET ♫

715
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:35,320
On this foggy...

716
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,400
On this foggy street.

717
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,477
How did you know this old song

718
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,056
♫ ONE DAY ♫

719
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,536
Everyone who lives in
this neighborhood knows it.

720
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,967
It's the theme song here.

721
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:47,576
♫ YOUR GENTLE SHADOW ♫

722
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,290
Twin flames also sang it.

723
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,800
Is that so?

724
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,090
I smell cigarette.

725
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,460
You must have smoked.

726
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,200
Cigarette!

727
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,780
Ah Soo-Wan, that rascal really...

728
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:11,036
He's too comfortable.

729
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,620
Makes me feel like I have lung disease.

(YES)

751
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,846
If you go 250 miles east,

752
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,380
there is a mountain of oil.

753
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,660
The peaks of this mountain
are hidden in the depths.

754
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,470
Only those who reach the top can see...

755
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,440
Man's hand really are just...

756
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,010
softer than Seo-Rae's.

757
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,350
It's because Seo-Rae have
calluses on her hands.

758
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,470
It's been like this lately.

759
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,960
Originally the palm of her
hand looked like lips.

760
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,536
Sidi.

761
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,070
Play a song.

762
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,830
Who is it? Who is that who sing Mist?

763
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:25,670
This kid is being disobedient to me lately.

764
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,070
You have the same phone as Seo-Rae's.

765
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,700
Of course, because we bought it together.

766
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,210
You shouldn't open too many apps.

767

(138 STEPS
2020.10.26 MONDAY)

770
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,030
Seo-Rae came to your
house this Monday, right?

771
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,430
If it was Monday,
of course she would have come.

772
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,800
Looks like you two went somewhere.

773
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,310
I stayed at home for over ten years.

774
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,810
Grandma, what day is it today?

775
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,050
Where's the grandmother
you're talking about, oppa?

776
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,700
I'm not sure what day of the week today.

777
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,600
Our Hae-Dong, you're so smart, right?

778
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,530
Just in case,

779
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,290
Did Seo-Rae

780
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,030
came here today?

781
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,550
It's Monday today.

782
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,516
I set the time after
Song Seo-Rae was photographed

783
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,220
by the entrance
and exit surveillance.

784
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
Go.

785
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:16,510
It takes about 7 minutes to
exchange the phone and leave.

786
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,940
If you sneak out the back window

787
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,040
there will be no surveillance camera.

788
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,490
There are two routes.

789
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,700
Easy route and difficult route.

790
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,400
But it takes about the same amount
of time to reach the top.

791
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:39,410
Although I have been
climbing the difficult route

792
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,650
Today, especially for newbie friends,

793
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,910
I'll take the easy route.

794
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,400
Song Seo-Rae must have
chosen the easy route.

795
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,650
Because she can't be seen by her husband.

796
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:52,540
All right, Chief. I'm on my way to work.

797
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,520
Yes?

798
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:54,750
I'm okay.

799
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:55,950
Yes.

800
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,410
9:00 AM. Elderly Care calls
to confirm her whereabouts.

801
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,620
You don't have to be ashamed
to slip in a place like this.

802
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,050
Bird Peak was originally
known as Oil and Water Peak.

803
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,660
It's as smooth as oil. That's
why it's called oil peak.

804
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,460
Isn't the scenery is very pleasant?

805
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,486
If you start listening to
Mahler's Fifth Symphony

806
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,560
you will arrive at the end
of the fourth movement.

807
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,366
Sitting on the top of the
mountain and listening to

808
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,630
Mahler's Fifth Symphony and
then going down the mountain.

809
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:48,110
Isn't it perfect?

810
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,740
The perfect way to kill someone.

811
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,250
Song Seo-Rae must have been
hiding here and reached the top

812
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,590
before the end of the fifth movement
of Mahler's Fifth Symphony.

813
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,761
The final line of the fifth movement
will encounter some difficulties.

814
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,130
Anyway, you'll know.

815
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,310
Compared to the difficult route
I climbed the mountain

816
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:41,750
This one is...

817
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:46,180
It's like eating sushi with a dip.

818
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,540
If you grab the ladder and climb up,

819
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:53,240
you will not notice that your body
has already reached the top.

820
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:31,130
(138 STEPS)

821
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,460
Korean women have a lot of trouble
with their hands, don't they?

822
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,330
At 10 a.m,

823
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,040
I am currently at the summit of
my favorite mountain, Geumjeongsan.

824
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,010
The dirty world is far away.

825
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:18,410
It's good that I died like this.

826
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,450
Aren't you afraid of heights?

827
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,780
Why is he beaten like that?

828
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,430
And branded like a domestic animal

829
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:10,820
You didn't call the police.

830
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,270
Why don't you trust the police?

831
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,060
He said he would send me back

832
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,860
to China.

833
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:25,080
Is that why you sent threatening
letters to your husband?

834
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,000
That letter will never be strange
no matter when it is sent.

835
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,920
Because everything is true.

836
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,540
You wrote the letter that Ki Do-Soo
sent to the immigration office?

837
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:47,560
But the address and name on
the envelope are handwritten.

838
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
How did you do it?

839
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,620
I just revised the defense
written by the husband.

840
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,580
And changed it to look like a suicide note.

841
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:30,200
So it's not true that Soo-Wan
is violent to you, right?

842
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,840
Isn't it violent for the police

843
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:38,010
to go to a woman's house after drinking?

844
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,440
All the photos are burned.

845
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,080
I deleted all the files I recorded.

846
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,400
That must be easy for you.

847
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,430
You pretended to like me,

848
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,400
so that I'll take care
of everything for you.

849
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:06,190
Don't speak about
our time that way.

850
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Us?

851
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,470
What kind of time was that?

852
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:19,510
The time I spent outside
your home each night?

853
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,800
Listening to your breathing
and falling asleep?

854
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,710
Whispering happiness in your ear
while holding you?

855
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,320
You said I have a taste.

856
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,810
Do you know where is my taste comes from?

857
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,140
It comes from my pride.

858
01:13:57,700 --> 01:13:59,530
I'm a very confident cop.

859
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:06,010
But it's been crazy lately.

860
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:12,570
The investigation was sabotaged, right?

861
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,850
What about me?

862
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,060
I'm completely broken.

863
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:33,020
You changed my grandma's phone

864
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,510
and replaced it with the same model.

865
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,730
She didn't notice at all.

866
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,320
Throw that phone into the sea.

867
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,650
Throw it into the deep sea.

868
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,540
Don't let anyone find it.

869
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:31,500
(DICTIONARY)

870
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:34,130
(COLLAPSE)

871
01:15:35,530 --> 01:15:39,270
(1. COLLAPSED AND BROKEN
Risk of collapse.)

872
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:03,127
Stress factors such as
not catching a criminal

873
01:16:03,151 --> 01:16:03,626
(13 MONTHS LATER)

874
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,370
manifested as sleep disturbance.

875
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:07,720
Well, what you can do now is

876
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:11,760
Take a sunbath thirty minutes before lunch,

877
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:15,230
You can keep your clothes on
but keep your eyes open.

878
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:17,020
Doctor.

879
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:20,120
You just opened in
Lipo not long ago, right?

880
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,310
There is no sun here in the morning.

881
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:26,400
Because of the fog.

882
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,710
You have hot water at home, right?

883
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,890
There is.

884
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,390
Take a foot bath before going to bed,

885
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,690
and I'll prescribe dopamine for you.

886
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,990
Try it and if it doesn't work,

887
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:48,980
I have a equipment here that helps you
breathe through your nose while you sleep.

888
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:52,700
Oh, this.

889
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:57,400
I heard that pomegranate has
the effect of delaying amenorrhea

890
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:02,140
Wouldn't it be more
convenient to not do it?

891
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,170
I know, even so,

892
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,036
I've been eating at home
every day since you came back.

893
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:11,420
I eat home-cooked pomegranates
every day and feel healthier.

894
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:13,920
Why are you getting more
and more wilted?

895
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,110
What are you saying?

896
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,120
You think I'm a pomegranate?

897
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,710
Director Lee was taken aback
when he saw your photo.

898
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,350
How can such a handsome
person become like this?

899
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,610
56% of middle-aged men suffer from
depression and become a high-risk group.

900
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,636
I heard that a man Dr. Lee met
who drank turtle essence

901
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,630
had a particularly good
effect on male hormones.

902
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,410
I'm really happy

903
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,520
that you're back in Lipo.

904
01:17:57,190 --> 01:17:58,630
I am also very happy.

905
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:03,760
You're happy if you're with
murder and violence.

906
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,190
Do you want to die?

907
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,200
I said where is your husband!

908
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,850
He left me and ran away.

909
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:21,310
You're crazy!

910
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,410
What's all this?

911
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,060
How can you buy all of this
if you're husband is not around?

912
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,880
While you're living like this,

913
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,640
My mother cries every day

914
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:40,270
and begging me to kill her instead.

915
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:45,970
What did the doctor say?

916
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,160
He said she won't last a month.

917
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,530
If my mother die,

918
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:55,930
your bastard husband

919
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:09,190
I'm done holding it in for ten minutes

920
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,040
Look at your mother.

921
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,610
Does your mother know
you're beating women?

922
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,730
Does she know what your nickname is?

923
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,160
If my mother die,

924
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:27,530
I'll put her in the freezer

925
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,246
I'll kill your husband

926
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:31,990
and then start the funeral.

927
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:39,910
I've had a hard time raising them.

928
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:41,756
Don't worry.

929
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,116
Our team leader

930
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:45,126
is the youngest person to be
commissioned as superintendent

931
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,760
but he's also the best in Busan.

932
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:48,500
Team leader.

933
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,660
The stolen items were 58 native turtles.

934
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:54,380
How much is the approximate amount of loss?

935
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,070
More than 3 million won in market prize.

936
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:58,830
Oh my, how can it be so expensive?

937
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,640
They say it's good for
middle-aged men with depression.

938
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,226
As expected, our youngest person
to become a superintendent.

939
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,740
How can you even know that?

940
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:09,136
Go outside and tell them
to turn off the lights.

941
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,160
Yes, sir.

942
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,020
Hey, Dohyuk.

943
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:17,960
You're stupid.

944
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,370
Didn't I tell you not to come?

945
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,630
This way I can see you.

946
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:30,270
There's no way to get out.
What are you going to do?

947
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:38,670
Honey, we have to pack
our things quickly.

948
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,436
Did you changed your number again?

949
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,166
Ah, hurry up and pack.

950
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,940
Chul-Sung has found out
where we are.

951
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,626
And next week,

952
01:20:45,650 --> 01:20:47,070
you'll help me host the Chinese.

953
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,390
If they can't get through to
China, it'll be hard for me.

954
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,600
Oh? What did you send?

955
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,520
So he have already been there.

956
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,230
I don't think we'll be able to
see anyone for a while.

957
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:00,850
I love you.

958
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,370
We're good, right?

959
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,110
Let's forget about Chul-Sung.

960
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,400
Let's move first.

961
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,580
We have to.

962
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:09,500
Now that Chul-Sung have found you

963
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:11,760
Where do you want to move?

964
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,406
What's going on?

965
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:34,380
Is this a real fire?

966
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:36,140
Or just a fire drill.

967
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:39,770
If it's a fake fire this time,
nobody's coming out next time.

968
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:56,330
People say you're here
because of depression.

969
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,250
Because you failed to stop
criminals from committing suicide.

970
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,160
But now you're cured.

971
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,740
Do you think I'm still depressed?

972
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:10,870
That's because I can't sleep well,
that's the reason.

973
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,980
He's wearing shoes?

974
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:16,900
You're not even smoking,
why don't you go in?

975
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:19,790
Did you come to accompany me
because you saw me alone?

976
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,840
It's really quiet in the
remote mountain village.

977
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,770
If you want to smoke,
go outside and smoke.

978
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,120
I love you.

979
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:09,230
What are you doing here?

980
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:10,260
I just moved in.

981
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:11,640
Why?

982
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,380
There's nothing to see here.

983
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,370
I like the fog.

984
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,870
I'm Song Seo-Rae.

985
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,260
I'm Chinese so I don't speak
Korean very well.

986
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,120
Honey.

987
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:32,030
Honey, this is the detective
who suspected me.

988
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:35,720
Ah, I am her "next husband".

989
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:37,770
I'm Im Ho-Shin.

990
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,330
I'm Jang Hae-Joon.

991
01:23:42,530 --> 01:23:43,700
Why did you come to Lipo?

992
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,970
I just touched the fish.

993
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:00,570
Why did you come to Lipo?

994
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,860
I just moved in as well.

995
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,630
My wife works here.

996
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:10,830
I'm Ahn Jung-An.

997
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:14,310
I've only heard of people
leaving here because of fog.

998
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,460
I've never heard of people
coming here because of fog.

999
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,720
Wait until you've seen how
moldy this place is.

1000
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,480
Honey, really you are.

1001
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,050
Actually, we came here
because of the nuclear power plant.

1002
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,280
What? What's wrong?

1003
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,840
The red alert?

1004
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,250
Woo Bin starred in a drama about
solving the nuclear leakage accident.

1005
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:45,680
Chinese women travel great distances
just to see the filming location.

1006
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:48,040
Doesn't she need a tour guide?

1007
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,346
Now that you're making money
from that point of sale,

1008
01:24:51,370 --> 01:24:53,440
I shouldn't have said this but

1009
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,916
A TV drama featuring a
groundless nuclear crisis

1010
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,560
is really giving us a headache.

1011
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:01,350
Ah, she works at a nuclear power plant.

1012
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:03,670
She's quite sensitive to such issues.

1013
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,140
Actually,

1014
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:07,940
Nuclear power is completely safe.

1015
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:18,320
Ah, have you ever been on a
stock market show?

1016
01:25:18,730 --> 01:25:19,730
You've seen it.

1017
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:22,110
I am a stock market analyst.

1018
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:25,160
It's not an anal analyst in
korean word who likes the anus.

1019
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,310
You look younger than I saw you on TV.

1020
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,030
Swimming in morning is my
secret to staying young.

1021
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:45,340
If you want to know
the investment tips,

1022
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,920
Feel free to contact me anytime.

1023
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,106
Please give me your business card too.

1024
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,930
Your business card is gorgeous...

1025
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,990
You don't have to run here.

1026
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,920
What a beautiful woman.

1027
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,520
Well,

1028
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,800
the green coat is beautiful.

1029
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,230
Isn't it color blue?

1030
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,480
Whatever the color.

1031
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,770
She's a chinese woman who
has been widowed.

1032
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,160
Have I heard about that case?

1033
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,256
I remember hearing about a
case where a Chinese wife

1034
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:55,850
committed suicide and
became a widower.

1035
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,600
There was a case like that.

1036
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,390
Her last husband was a
criminal, wasn't he?

1037
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,440
No.

1038
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,560
I suspect the wrong person.

1039
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,080
Didn't you doubt that woman too?

1040
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:11,130
Yeah.

1041
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,490
But it turns out that her
husband died by suicide.

1042
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,620
Why do you always suspect
the wrong people?

1043
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,370
That's why people hate us.

1044
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,490
Us?

1045
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:25,350
Us, the police.

1046
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:49,226
(DETECTIVE YEO YEON-SOO)

1047
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:51,100
Honey, answer the phone for me.

1048
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:55,710
My hands are covered in blood.

1049
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:58,640
Hello?

1050
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,530
Honey.

1051
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:05,990
Congratulations.

1052
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:09,830
There's a murder.

1053
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,460
The estimated time of death is 11:00.

1054
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,280
Presumed to have been
stabbed 17 times.

1055
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,630
There are 13 stabs in the
stomach and chest.

1056
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,570
4 stabs on back.

1057
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:29,120
He must be stabbed in the
back when you ran away.

1058
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,150
Can someone run away with 13 stabbings?

1059
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:37,310
By the way, why is the corpse
in that position?

1060
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:40,050
The first person to find him
was his wife.

1061
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,820
Team leader, should I bring her here?

1062
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:23,660
The suspect is left-handed.

1063
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:28,630
Write down.

1064
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,490
That's why you came to Lipo?

1065
01:29:50,910 --> 01:29:52,220
Am I such a pushover?

1066
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:57,430
Am I so wicked?

1067
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:11,520
Song Seo-Rae, listen carefully.

1068
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,380
An alibi this time

1069
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:17,770
should be as hard as under the eaves.

1070
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,720
Do you think his wife is the murderer?

1071
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,220
Why?

1072
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:28,106
Because there's no sign of invasion,
no sign of theft,

1073
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:29,200
no sign of binding?

1074
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,140
Because of sudden frontal stabbing

1075
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,960
Do you think this is a
vengeful killing?

1076
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:38,080
Or maybe because his wife
wasn't shocked or sad?

1077
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:42,070
It varies from person to person,
some people grieve like waves...

1078
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:45,690
Why do you always ask me questions?

1079
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:47,610
Why didn't you ask to
anyone else like that?

1080
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:54,720
I met her in Busan last year
because of the incident case.

1081
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,530
It was also because her husband died.

1082
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,030
Did she kill him?

1083
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,960
I suddenly wondered if she
might be the killer.

1084
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:06,850
That case was classified as a suicide.

1085
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,881
And yet again, her husband died here,
and still under my jurisdiction.

1086
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,670
But she's right-handed.

1087
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:14,366
So think about it.

1088
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:16,060
How could she be a criminal?

1089
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,120
They want me to go
to the police station

1090
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,670
Can I take my handbag out?

1091
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,130
You went for a walk.

1092
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,146
And you don't have a cell phone with you,
so you have no way to track your location,

1093
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:35,680
Do you have way to prove your alibi?

1094
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:37,580
I know.

1095
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,200
It doesn't look like you're worried.

1096
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:45,400
Does your husband ever had
a grudge against anyone?

1097
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,146
I heard that he borrowed
other people's money

1098
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:49,970
to invest a lot and
still lost a lot of money.

1099
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,770
He have lost a lot of money lately.

1100
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:55,540
He lost money and still
live in a high-end villa.

1101
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:59,010
You have to see how much
money you spend to save money.

1102
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,820
Ah, why did you marry such a man?

1103
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,040
I married a man

1104
01:32:09,870 --> 01:32:13,880
to make up my mind about
breaking up with him.

1105
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:23,110
What did you come to Lipo for?

1106
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:26,890
We're here for no reason.

1107
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:30,550
If there's one, the creditors
will find us.

1108
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:44,500
You don't marry your husband
simply because you love him.

1109
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:47,590
Your husband is threatened everywhere.

1110
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:49,660
And later on, die.

1111
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,840
Same as last year.

1112
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:53,460
What?

1113
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:56,650
My previous husband
committed suicide.

1114
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,680
How can it be the same
to my recent husband?

1115
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,820
Okay.

1116
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,650
Your two husbands.

1117
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:10,070
And it's a very distant jurisdiction.

1118
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,360
In remote jurisdictions

1119
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,720
One committed suicide
and one was killed.

1120
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:19,330
If people hear something like this,

1121
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:20,890
I'm sure they thinks so too

1122
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,340
that's such a coincidence.

1123
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,390
What do you think would
people say to you?

1124
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:37,300
What a poor woman.

1125
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:26,580
It's not this one, it's a blue dress.

1126
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:27,950
There's no coat too.

1127
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,560
Are you sure it's blue?

1128
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:31,260
Not green?

1129
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:32,930
Thank you.

1130
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,660
She's right, it's blue.

1131
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:41,030
What was she doing?

1132
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:54,260
You really...

1133
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,360
Why did you come
to this neighborhood?

1134
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,450
Why do you keep asking?

1135
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,570
Does it matter to you why I'm here?

1136
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,660
Why is that important?

1137
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:19,240
This is the only way I can see you.
What can I do?

1138
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:29,500
What were you wearing for
a walk at Haenyeo Pier?

1139
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,930
This one.

1140
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,680
You're lying.

1141
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:36,940
Where is the green dress?

1142
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,060
The green one that looks blue.

1143
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:41,390
With shiny buttons.

1144
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:43,310
Did you take a closer look?

1145
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,360
I'm not going to turn
everything upside down.

1146
01:35:55,630 --> 01:35:56,910
Ah, sorry, sorry.

1147
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,290
You're here.

1148
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,220
Did you see that?

1149
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,510
Wow, there's also a murder
in our village.

1150
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,606
I'm already sleepy now.

FOUND DEAD IN LIPO WHILE ESCAPING)

1152
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:12,040
What should I do at night?

1153
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,470
After I came back from a walk,

1154
01:36:35,230 --> 01:36:36,780
The smell of blood is nauseating.

1155
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:41,930
I thought of you.

1156
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,290
You'll definitely come to see this.

1157
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,060
You must be scared.

1158
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,780
Song Seo-Rae.

1159
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,730
You just admitted that you annihilated
important evidence in the murder.

1160

As a suspect in the murder of Lin Ho-shin,

1161
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,940
I'm putting you under
emergency arrest right now.

1162
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,440
I don't like the police
following around my husband.

1163
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,850
We have this smartwatch, right?

1164
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:58,910
Extract the audio file.

1165
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:01,050
It must be recorded in Chinese,

1166
01:38:01,380 --> 01:38:02,466
so please find someone to translate it.

1167
01:38:02,490 --> 01:38:03,490
Yes, sir.

1168
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:08,280
Are you a male?

1169
01:38:08,710 --> 01:38:09,710
No.

1170

Have you ever killed someone?

1171
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:15,230
Yes.

1172
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:20,310
Did you kill your husband, Im Ho-Shin?

1173
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:27,770
I didn't.

1174
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,810
Team leader.

1175
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,770
What are you doing here?

1176
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,230
This is the recording of the smart watch.

1177
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:17,630
Aren't we checked the license plates around
the resort before and after the murder?

1178
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:20,790
Among them, there are victims
of Lim Ho-shin's fraud.

1179
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,980
He's the head of a gang.

1180
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,590
His name is Sa Chul-Sung.

1181
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,800
Is there anyone else with
the surname Sa?

1182
01:39:33,860 --> 01:39:35,230
Let go!

1183
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,170
Are you okay? What are you doing?

1184
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:44,850
Call her.

1185
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:49,826
Call her.

1186
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:50,850
Mom!

1187
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:55,130
He's left-handed.

1188
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,720
270 million won.

1189
01:39:59,740 --> 01:40:01,676
My mother has been running
a food stall for ten years,

1190
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:03,266
and she managed to
open a Chinese restaurant

1191
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:05,370
for eighteen hours a day in this island.

1192
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,170
I trusted Lin Ho-shin
with all that money.

1193
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,630
At first, I only put 10 million won.

1194
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,560
But it's always nice

1195
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:15,720
to pay dividends and
pin everything to the ground.

1196
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:18,570
Then he took a lot of money that I saved,

1197
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:20,780
and go to hotels all
over the country.

1198
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:22,550
He's just gambling

1199
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:24,530
and buy his wife an expensive
bags and clothes.

1200
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,650
He spend my money like a pig,
that son of a bitch.

1201
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:28,880
It's worth 10 billion won.

1202
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,770
My mom had severe diabetes.

1203
01:40:33,530 --> 01:40:35,186
But she had a nervous breakdown

1204
01:40:35,210 --> 01:40:36,606
after knowing that
the money was tricked.

1205
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,330
She collapsed due to kidney complications.

1206
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,840
Because she didn't get the
proper treatment,

1207
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,200
It lead her ten toes to be amputated.

1208
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:46,090
Do you know why my
nickname is Ironstone?

1209
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:49,006
'Cause I'm good at slapping people
on the face with this iron slap.

1210
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:50,390
That's why they call me Ironstone.

1211
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:53,820
Hitting someone with a slap is lighter than
hitting someone with a fist.

1212
01:40:54,050 --> 01:40:55,500
That's why I can keep slapping.

1213
01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:57,900
But I...

1214
01:40:58,180 --> 01:40:59,830
But I can't even kill Im Ho-Shin.

1215
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:01,250
Is that still a human being?

1216
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:02,830
Do you know Song Seo-Rae.

1217
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,950
Didn't you ask Song Seo-Rae to kill him?

1218
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,740
Really, I...

1219
01:41:10,590 --> 01:41:13,520
I'm not the type of person who can
simply tell others what to do.

1220
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,810
Song Seo-Rae, she really helped me.

1221
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:17,920
She'll never know.

1222
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,010
Why can't she escape from me

1223
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:21,970
no matter how hard she try?

1224
01:41:26,670 --> 01:41:29,260
I installed a location software

1225
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,910
on my phone.

1226
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,280
Wow, is this Im Ho-Shin?

1227
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,690
Why is he sitting like this?

1228
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,000
It's scary.

1229
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,380
You motherfucker.

1230
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,100
Do you want me to slap you hard today?

1231
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:52,500
Are you crazy?

1232
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,140
Team leader, aren't you happy?

1233
01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:04,770
Why would I?

1234
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:08,430
We solved the first murder
case in Lipo, didn't we?

1235
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,620
Where is the best place to have dinner?

1236
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,520
Case solved?

1237
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,640
Who said the case is solved?

1238
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:15,876
Now that the criminal has caught,

1239
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:18,240
They should be able to let
Song Seo-Rae go home.

1240
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:19,820
That's what I thought.

1241
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:22,766
The turtle thief is on the run
on a motorcycle

1242
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:24,700
in Greenstone Walls
3-way Village Hall bound.

1243
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,280
I repeat, in Greenstone Walls
3-way Village Hall bound.

1244
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:43,950
Hey, it's okay.
He won't be able to run again!

1245
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,710
Gather the turtles!

1246
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:50,590
Oppa, hurry up.

1247
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:52,170
Get up.

1248
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,666
Carry him on your back,
we need to catch him.

1249
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:54,170
Yes, sir.

1250
01:42:54,450 --> 01:42:56,260
Hey, hey. Hop on my back!

1251
01:42:56,850 --> 01:42:57,760
Grab the big one first.

1252
01:42:57,790 --> 01:42:59,230
They're vicious. Watch your fingers!

1253
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:18,240
We caught the turtle thief.

1254
01:43:22,610 --> 01:43:25,720
My husband and the husband
of a woman you know

1255
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:27,966
I missed his phone calls in
the middle of the night

1256
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:29,670
and he even called twice.

1257
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,160
Is it a wrong number?

1258
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,500
To a married woman you're meeting
for the first time for no reason?

1259
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:41,520
Although this can pass like this

1260
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:45,300
What if that man gets killed
a few days later?

1261
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,480
Honey.

1262
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:56,330
Did you kill him?

1263
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,400
Did the two of you
kill him together?

1264
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,200
Are your fingers all right?

1265
01:44:12,130 --> 01:44:13,970
This is Im Ho-Shin's illegal
cell phone number.

1266
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:15,720
Track where he was before he died.

1267
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:21,930

1269
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:25,810
Yes?

1270
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,620
Why was the phone here
when the owner died at home?

1271
01:44:34,870 --> 01:44:36,230
The owner's phone turn on and off.

1272
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:38,976
Put your arms around one more time.

1273
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,360
Put your hands up a little higher.

1274

Stop!

1276
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,860
She dropped the phone.

1277
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:56,180
Let's find the divers and
start searching the area.

1278
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:57,380
Is it deep there?

1279
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,330
Get yourself together.

1280
01:44:59,730 --> 01:45:01,250
We've already caught the criminal.

1281
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:03,220
There's evidence and we got a confession.

1282
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:06,270
Please stop clinging to that woman.

1283
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:08,300
Don't you feel sorry for her?

1284
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,720
He's wearing a shoes?

1285
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,160
I can see his beard.

1286
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:32,580
Is he lazy to shave

1287
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:33,970
in the morning and night?

1288
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:39,380
He looks no energy...
Is it because he haven't seen me?

1289
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:50,606
When he made me that
strange chinese food,

1290
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:52,280
I've been smoking next to him

1291
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:54,910
and he couldn't hold back the smoke.

1292
01:45:55,530 --> 01:45:58,010
All he can say is "I love you", my ass.

1293
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:03,670
I remember the nights
he peed at me.

1294
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:06,780
I felt like a trustworthy man,

01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:12,510
was protecting me.

1297
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:14,900
He's coming.

1298
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:16,706
As soon as he come,

1299
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:19,160
he'll ask me if I came
to Lipo to do this.

1300
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:21,030
What should I do?

1301
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,880
Why do you keep crying,

1302
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:26,030
Song Seo-Rae?

1303
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:30,840
Should I tell him the answer?

1304
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:34,280
No.

1305
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,270
He may

1306
01:46:38,710 --> 01:46:40,090
already know.

1307
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,210
I don't know if he'll ask me.

1308
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:49,670
Is that why you came to Lipo?

1309
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:00,720
Hello.

1310
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:02,750
What's on that phone?

1311
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:03,870
Answer me.

1312
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,490
Open the door, hurry.

1313
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:10,070
I'm not home.

1314
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:11,620
Then where are you?

1315
01:47:12,290 --> 01:47:13,290
Homi mountain.

1316
01:47:14,530 --> 01:47:17,570
There must be something in Im Ho-Shin's
phone that you threw it into the sea.

1317
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,220
Don't doze off.

1318
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,520
Hold it for a while.

1319
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:23,730
There's no fog here.

1320
01:47:25,870 --> 01:47:27,950
Why did Im Ho-Shin call my wife?

1321
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:33,580
Moms who like mountains

1322
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,050
often say this.

1323
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:37,270
Whenever I'm upset,

1324
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:42,830
If I go to Korea,
there will be this mountain.

1325
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,080
Tell me the truth.

1326
01:47:48,630 --> 01:47:50,740
You also knew that Im
Ho-sin is going to call

1327
01:47:51,230 --> 01:47:52,260
my wife, right?

1328
01:47:53,410 --> 01:47:54,586
Despite the fact that
the state has spared him

1329
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:56,240
even the most heinous sentence

1330
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,390
But no matter what people say,
in my heart

1331
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,030
Homi mountain is my mountain.

1332
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,990
Mom.

1333
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,360
Grandfather.

1334
01:48:19,510 --> 01:48:21,480
I've brought a man I can trust.

1335
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,750
Help me out.

1336
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:40,170
You know I'm afraid of heights.

1337
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:52,120
Why did I marry a man like that?

1338
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:58,470
Because an ideal man like
you wouldn't marry me.

1339
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,520
If you want to take a look,

1340
01:49:01,650 --> 01:49:03,650
atleast a murder has to happen.

1341
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:05,660
Is this the time to joke?

1342
01:49:18,900 --> 01:49:22,750
You've been unable to sleep
comfortably since I left you, right?

1343
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,920
Even if you close your eyes,
you've always see me, don't you?

1344
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:33,260
Aren't you?

1345
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:43,976
That night when you ran
into me in the marketplace,

1346
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,700
you suddenly felt like
you were alive again, right?

1347
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:49,380
At last.

1348
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:58,290
My hands are soft now, aren't they?

1349
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:14,530
In the past 400 days, you...

1350
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:20,250
You...

1351
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:29,576
But even then,

1352
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:32,990
the fact that I'm a police and you're
the suspect will not change.

1353
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:40,340
You're a person suspected by the police.

1354
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:44,000
I like that.

1355
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:49,840
Just be comfortable and
treat me like you always do.

1356
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:52,590
Treat me like a suspect.

1357
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:59,280
Aren't you wondering why
I like you, Seo-Rae?

1358
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,980
Or are you just not interested?

1359
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
What about you?

1360
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:13,630
My body is stiff.

1361
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:18,060
There are few people who are
not nervous but who are so honest.

1362
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:24,980
I think I've said that I like you a lot.

1363
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:46,360
What's with the four fentanyls here?

1364
01:52:06,450 --> 01:52:08,570
I've been taking it back
and forth for the whole time.

1365
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:10,770
It's too heavy.

1366
01:52:15,070 --> 01:52:16,560
Bye, grandpa.

1367
01:52:32,510 --> 01:52:34,730
Bye... Mom.

1368
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:06,276
Didn't I let you throw it away

1369
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:07,560
so that no one could find it!

1370
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:13,860
Use this to do re-investigation.

1371
01:53:15,220 --> 01:53:17,310
Let's go back to the old days.

1372
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:46,906
Looks like I want to unsloved your case,

1373
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,430
that's why I went to Lipo.

1374
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,920
Manager Lee!

1375
01:55:11,290 --> 01:55:12,290
Yes?

1376
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:15,880
You've never seen him before, have you?

1377
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,440
He said he recently got divorced.

1378
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:20,890
I'm Lee Joon. I've heard a lot about you.

1379
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:34,700
Isn't it snowing here?

1380
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:36,590
What?

1381
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:48,490
So how do we deal
with that problem?

1382
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:50,540
What problem?

1383
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,120
Even if I hate it,

1384
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,010
I promise to do it every week.

1385
01:55:55,880 --> 01:55:56,990
Would you excuse me?

1386
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:11,340
Can you sleep?

1387
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,850
I went to the hospital for an examination

1388
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:16,880
but I woke up 47 times in an hour.

1389
01:56:19,340 --> 01:56:20,340
Can you believe it?

1390
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:25,480
I wish I could give you
a piece of my sleep

1391
01:56:25,740 --> 01:56:26,740
Just like a battery.

1392
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,160
It's because of my deliberated breathing.

1393
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:40,810
I have to use a nose-assisted
breathing machine when I go to bed.

1394
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,080
It's weird.

1395
01:56:45,330 --> 01:56:46,970
When I'm awake,
I breathe through my nose.

1396
01:57:01,960 --> 01:57:04,170
But that doesn't mean
I snore when I sleep.

1397
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:10,030
I know.

1398
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:21,650
Sunbathing.

1399
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:23,280
Vitamin D.

1400
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,610
Isn't it good to do it
once after a long time?

1401
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:27,960
It's been 30 minutes.

1402
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:35,630
I told the haenyeo.

1403
01:57:36,230 --> 01:57:38,356
If they see a cell phone when
you're fishing for example,

1404
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:40,140
I told them to make sure
they bring it to us.

1405
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:44,920
Can this be restored?

On the morning of your mother's death,
did you saw Song Seo-Rae?

1428
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:09,940
She came early in the
morning to visit.

1429
01:59:12,810 --> 01:59:17,220
She said that she felt bad
for my mother left like that.

1430

After all, we're all Chinese

1431
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:23,360
Didn't she advise her to take any medicine?

Something that is good for diabetes.

It's a green capsule.

Compared to that,

1435
01:59:31,090 --> 01:59:33,930
That woman knows how to
take care her patients.

1436
01:59:34,590 --> 01:59:37,910
She rub her here and there,
and my mom was in such a good mood.

1437
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,790
So I went out for breakfast, too.

1438
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:44,030
Later, I found out that
Song Seo-Rae has already left.

1439
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:47,540
Mother lay off comfortably
with her eyes closed.

1440
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:50,940
It's weird but she feel
drowsy for no reason.

1441

And then...

1442
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:02,800
But what does my mother's death
have to do with Song's rub?

1443

Didn't Chul-Sung say he had
location software installed on his phone?

1444
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:21,700
Hello, Hae-Joon.

1445
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:24,040
I repaired Im Ho-Shin's phone privately.

1446

There are no voice recordings at all.

1447
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:29,846
It's true that the one who killed
your husband was Chung-Sung.

1448
02:00:29,870 --> 02:00:32,010
But you killed Chul-Sung's mother.

1449
02:00:32,990 --> 02:00:36,290
Because Chul-Sung said he'd
kill your husband if his mother died.

1450
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:41,480
Your husband and Chul-Sung's mother.

1451
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,680
Did you kill her because of me, isn't it?

1452
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,020
She's a dying person anyway

1453
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:58,070
but why are you so anxious
that you gave her fentanyl?

1454
02:00:59,690 --> 02:01:01,470
Because she said thank you.

1455
02:01:09,660 --> 02:01:12,260
What is the recording that Im Ho-Shin said
he was going to reveal?

1456
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:14,260
Don't worry about that.

1457
02:01:15,240 --> 02:01:17,200
I'm not asking that
because I'm worried.

1458
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,760
You've got the original, haven't you?

1459
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:21,370
What is it?

1460
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,450
It's your voice.

1461
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:26,290
What?

1462
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:30,740
The record of your voice
saying you love me.

1463
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:36,640
Did I?

1464
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,280
Because I like it so much,
I keep listening.

1465
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,020
My husband found out.

1466
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,680
When did I say I love you?

1467
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,080
When?

1468
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,270
The moment you said you loved me,

1469
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:15,950
Your love is over.

1470
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:21,890
The moment your love ends,

1471
02:02:23,290 --> 02:02:25,190
My love begins.

1472
02:02:26,100 --> 02:02:27,100
Please say it in Korean.

1473
02:02:29,850 --> 02:02:30,880
Seo-Rae.

1474
02:02:33,610 --> 02:02:34,610
Hae-Joon.

1475
02:02:37,450 --> 02:02:39,250
The cell phone that was
fished out of the sea,

1476
02:02:40,150 --> 02:02:41,480
Throw it away again.

1477
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:48,350
Throw it deeper into the sea.

1478
02:02:49,850 --> 02:02:51,716
Why do you keep saying
irrelevant things?

1479
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:53,500
Gosh, it's annoying, really...

1480
02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:57,290
Where are you going?

1481
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:02,160
Seo-Rae.

1482
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:04,050
Hello?

1483
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:06,320
Hello?

1484
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:34,270
Seo-Rae!

1485
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:13,760
(VOICE RECORD)

1486
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:18,010
(BREAKS DOWN AND WAKES UP)

1487
02:05:35,560 --> 02:05:36,720
You burnedall the photos.

1488
02:05:37,710 --> 02:05:38,710
I...

1489
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:12,300
It should be easy to delete
all the files I've recorded.

1490
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,860
You just pretend to show
that you like me

1491
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:17,150
so that I'll take care
of everything for you.

1492
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:18,320
Don't speak about our-

1493
02:06:21,220 --> 02:06:22,810
Throw that phone into the sea.

1494
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:28,480
Throw it into the deep sea.

1495
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:31,000
Don't let anyone find it.

1496
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:47,950
Throw that phone into the sea.

1497
02:06:48,310 --> 02:06:49,670
Throw it to the sea.

1498
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:54,440
- Throw it into the deep sea.
- Throw it into the deep sea.

1499
02:06:54,710 --> 02:06:56,050
Don't let anyone find it.

1500
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,890
Don't let anyone find it.

1501
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:25,950
I probably want to unsolve your case,

1502
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:27,670
That's why I went to Lipo.

1503
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:32,850
You put a picture of me on the wall

1504
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:35,480
and can't even sleep well,

1505
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,680
thinking about it a lot.

1506
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:01,950
Seo-Rae!

1507
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,870
Seo-Rae, where are you?

1508
02:09:37,890 --> 02:09:40,250
Hey, we're sending out a
wanted warrant to the headquarters.

1509
02:09:40,570 --> 02:09:41,570
Here...

1510
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:44,590
The tide began to rise
around the rocks of the sea.

1511
02:09:45,640 --> 02:09:47,320
Let all the people who can come along.

1512
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:49,500
Song Seo-Rae is gone!

1513
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,866
We can find her as soon as possible.

1514
02:09:51,890 --> 02:09:52,980
She hasn't gone far.

1515
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:57,490
If you have time to ask me,
why don't you come here quickly?

1516
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,760
In a little while,
we won't be able to see nothing!

1517
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:39,380
But it's been crazy lately.

1518
02:10:40,330 --> 02:10:41,890
The investigation was sabotaged, right?

1519
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:45,600
I'm...

1520
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:49,410
completely broken.

1521
02:10:53,680 --> 02:10:55,310
You changed my grandma's phone

1522
02:10:56,510 --> 02:10:57,950
and replaced it with the same model.

1523
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,100
She didn't notice at all.

1524
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:03,690
Throw that phone into the sea.

1525
02:11:06,160 --> 02:11:07,880
Throw it into the deep sea.

1526
02:11:08,730 --> 02:11:10,130
Don't let anyone find it.

1527
02:11:17,250 --> 02:11:18,650
"Throw that phone into the sea."

1528
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:21,670
It's your voice.

1529
02:11:23,180 --> 02:11:25,750
Your voice saying you love me.

1530
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:09,590
Seo-Rae!

1531
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:15,400
Seo-Rae!

1532
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:22,640
Seo-Rae!

1533
02:12:32,110 --> 02:12:33,110
Seo-Rae!

1534
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:40,440
Seo-Rae!

1535
02:12:57,670 --> 02:12:59,410
Seo-Rae!

1536
02:13:00,305 --> 02:14:00,356
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
