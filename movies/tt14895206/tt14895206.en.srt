1
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:08,313
(arrows whooshing)

2
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:18,056
(film reeling)

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

4
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:41,446
(wind howling)

5
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,651
(soft music)

6
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,518
(hooves clomping)

7
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:17,309
(slamming)
(man): Give it up, Frank!

8
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:18,945
(woman screaming)
(gunshots)

9
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:20,580
(glass shattering)

10
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:22,314
(dog barking)

11
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,685
(Old West music)

12
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:38,463
Joe Cribbens.

13
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:43,502
Joe Cribbens! Visitor!

14
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:50,810
Well, goddamn. Hard to figure
who I'd less rather see.

15
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,514
What brings a skunk
like you here?

16
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:57,717
I was in the neighborhood
collecting reward money.

17
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,484
Thought I'd pay you a visit.

18
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,288
Yeah. Heard you took down
Frank Ledbetter last week.

19
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:07,292
We get all the news in here.
You'd be surprised.

20
00:03:08,628 --> 00:03:10,897
How much you gonna collect
for old Frank?

21
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,266
(Max): Friend of yours?
- Never met the man,

22
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:15,902
but I was on his side.

23
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:21,908
Okay, bounty man. Did you give
him much of a chance?

24
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:23,810
Same chance he gave me.

25
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,678
(man breathing heavily)

26
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,748
Give it up, Frank!
(woman screaming)

27
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,718
(gunshots)
(glass shattering)

28
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,755
Right. Just another fella
dead for a dollar.

29
00:03:35,788 --> 00:03:39,859
I figure you know I'm getting
out of here next week.

30
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,429
Served my time. All five years.

31
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,264
I heard you've been
telling people

32
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:48,266
first thing you were gonna do
when you walk out of here

33
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,636
is get a gun and look me up.

34
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,471
Don't flatter yourself.

35
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:54,674
I'm not going out of my way
to find you.

36
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:58,376
I'm going to head down
to Mexico.

37
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,681
Just... play out the string.

38
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:04,784
Cards, tequila, señoritas...

39
00:04:04,817 --> 00:04:06,886
No matter where you're headed,

40
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,757
you'll still end up the same.
Horse thief.

41
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:14,527
- Guilty.
- Bank robber.

42
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:17,797
- Couldn't prove it.
- Killed a couple of men.

43
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,800
Couldn't prove it,
and I never killed nobody

44
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,301
that wasn't trying to kill me.

45
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:26,739
(gunshots)

46
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:34,747
When you took me down,
I was sleeping.

47
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,650
It wasn't a real fight.

48
00:04:37,683 --> 00:04:41,353
I just... woke up with a gun
in my face.

49
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:43,022
Stay clear of me, Joe.

50
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,725
You do the same!

51
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,530
Otherwise, most likely,
you're a dead man.

52
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:56,401
I don't usually tell a man
twice. Stay clear of me, Joe.

53
00:04:57,703 --> 00:04:59,371
(soft music)

54
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:04,510
Shit heel.

55
00:05:05,845 --> 00:05:07,345
(tense music)

56
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,848
(clock chiming)

57
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:20,560
(clock ticking)

58
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:21,861
(gun clicking)

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,704
Prisoner number 387,
Joe Cribbens.

60
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,776
Your paperwork came
in the afternoon mail.

61
00:05:36,809 --> 00:05:38,778
Tomorrow morning 10 o'clock,

62
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:40,847
you get your possessions back
and a government check

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,950
for 50 dollars.
Good luck to you, Joe.

64
00:05:43,983 --> 00:05:45,417
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:47,920
Yip!

66
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,956
(♪)

67
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,041
(insects buzzing)

68
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,679
Take a last look.

69
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,572
(man): Captain Brand.
Rider approaching, sir.

70
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:45,578
(horse neighing)

71
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:50,883
Good morning.
Let me take care of your horse.

72
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,692
Max Borlund, follow us.

73
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,970
Sir. Mr. Borlund, sir.

74
00:07:11,003 --> 00:07:12,705
As you were, corporal.

75
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,612
Mr. Borlund. It's good
to see you again.

76
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:21,914
It's been some time.
- It has.

77
00:07:21,948 --> 00:07:25,483
This is Martin Kidd. He could
stand to use your services.

78
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:27,787
Mr. Kidd is a prominent
businessman here

79
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,189
in the territory,
and a friend to the army.

80
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,994
Mr. Borlund, it seems your
reputation precedes you.

81
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:36,796
I'll accept that
as a compliment.

82
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,931
Gentlemen, this is
a clandestine moment

83
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:41,534
and a meeting
that never happened.

84
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,236
That's why I've convened it out
here in the middle of nowhere.

85
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,806
I'll let you two
get down to business.

86
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:50,776
Um, Mr. Borlund, I doubt
that you're familiar

87
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,012
with a Buffalo soldier
by the name of Elijah Jones?

88
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,847
Private Elijah Jones? No?

89
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,184
<i>Right, he's taken a white woman,
my wife, Rachel.</i>

90
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,720
<i>Abducted her three weeks ago,</i>

91
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:03,089
<i>took her across the border
down to Mexico.</i>

92
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:06,258
<i>I sent out patrols,
thought we could head 'em off,</i>

93
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:09,562
find 'em before they got
to the border. We missed 'em.

94
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,998
Alright, so, son of a bitch
is asking for $10,000

95
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,866
in ransom money,
which I will not pay.

96
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,570
I do not reward criminals,
but I am willing to offer you

97
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:21,941
$2,000 to bring Rachel back.
$500 advance.

98
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,213
(horse neighing)

99
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:30,583
This will help you
identify Rachel.

100
00:08:30,616 --> 00:08:33,552
Captain Brand there
has a document stating

101
00:08:33,586 --> 00:08:36,088
that you are a representative
of the United States government

102
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,591
and you're in pursuit of Elijah,
in case you run into any

103
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:41,093
legal problems down in Mexico.

104
00:08:41,127 --> 00:08:43,529
Well, three weeks head start...

105
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:47,933
I need supplies, a pack mule,
ammunition.

106
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:51,337
Discretion in this matter,
that's of paramount importance.

107
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,306
It's my wife's reputation
to consider.

108
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:57,276
As well as my own.

109
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,644
Sergeant Poe!

110
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:02,281
Off the books, we're sending
one soldier to accompany you.

111
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:08,154
Sir! Mr. Borlund,
as ordered by the captain,

112
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,689
Sergeant Alonzo Poe
reporting for duty, sir!

113
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:14,593
(Brand): Make sure
he dresses civilian.

114
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,629
Things need to look proper.

115
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:18,197
Don't want you two
to travel together

116
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,832
until you're both south
of the border.

117
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:22,334
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Sir, yes, sir!

118
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:26,605
(♪)

119
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:41,787
Well, well. Here comes
the bounty man.

120
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:43,122
(chuckles)

121
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:44,957
Captain say he the best shooter
in the territory,

122
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,592
rifle or pistol.

123
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,831
(chuckles)

124
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,700
(hooves clomping)

125
00:09:59,138 --> 00:10:00,306
Sergeant Poe.

126
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:02,374
Mr. Borlund, sir.

127
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,011
The captain tells me
you're gonna be a very

128
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:07,847
valuable man on this trip.

129
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,915
I just want to say
if things get tight,

130
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:12,418
I'm a damn good shot.
Best eye in the regiment.

131
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,987
(chuckles)
- Captain also says

132
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,724
you have an idea where Mrs. Kidd
and this Elijah Jones may be.

133
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,827
Oh, I know exactly where.
Got the map right here.

134
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,163
Can't do much better than that,

135
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:25,364
now can you?
(chuckles)

136
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:27,066
Shows you right to where
they're hiding out.

137
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:28,334
Now, this here map
was given to me

138
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:29,869
by Private Elijah Jones himself.

139
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:31,437
Private Jones
just hands out maps

140
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,806
of where he's gonna be
after he deserts the army

141
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,342
and abducts a white woman?
Let me see this map.

142
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,744
(paper rustling)

143
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:49,855
According to this,
they're deep into Chihuahua.

144
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,957
Mm-hmm.
That sounds about right.

145
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,926
Elijah said it was a fair piece.

146
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:58,197
Look, normally we'd head
straight to San Juanito.

147
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,999
It's the best road south.

148
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,769
Start asking if anyone's seen
a Black man travelling

149
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:06,071
with a white woman,
but if he abducted her,

150
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,174
he'd avoid showing up in cities.

151
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:12,344
No. He run off,
damn foolish. But...

152
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,948
Well, Elijah didn't
abduct nobody.

153
00:11:17,316 --> 00:11:18,951
That's not what I've been told.

154
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:21,887
Let me tell you about Elijah.

155
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:26,058
Like all of God's children,
he's got his faults.

156
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:28,093
But in a lot of ways,
he's a really good fella.

157
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,161
(chuckling)

158
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:33,766
I know these is delicate
matters, but I gotta say,

159
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,302
if she's with Elijah,
it's 'cause she wanna be.

160
00:11:36,969 --> 00:11:38,804
Sounds like
you're defending him.

161
00:11:40,472 --> 00:11:42,208
Private Elijah Jones
was expecting me

162
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,077
to join up with him. Gave me
the map so I could find the way.

163
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:48,981
Now I'm the one who's supposed
to deliver the ransom money.

164
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:52,084
That's why I truly do believe
they are holed up

165
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:54,987
in the middle of nowhere
at an American fella's place,

166
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,422
named Hannon.

167
00:11:56,455 --> 00:12:00,025
There's a Hannon
that's a wanted man in Texas.

168
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:02,127
The poster's been up
for five years.

169
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:05,397
Accomplice to murder.
Bank robbery in El Paso.

170
00:12:06,832 --> 00:12:08,200
Do you know this woman?
(Poe): Mm-hmm.

171
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:09,536
Ain't never met her.

172
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:12,171
She helped improve Elijah's
reading in the school.

173
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:13,839
At least that's what he told me.

174
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:18,110
Yeah, is this the face that
launched a thousand ships?

175
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,213
You wanna run that by me
one more time?

176
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:24,216
Ah, it's a line by Marlowe,
Shakespeare's time,

177
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,118
you know, about Helen of Troy.

178
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,153
All right, right, right, I was
just reading all about that

179
00:12:28,187 --> 00:12:29,221
just the other day.

180
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:32,324
- You trust that map?
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:34,860
And they're holed up down there

182
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,328
waiting for the money
that I ain't bringing.

183
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,935
Ooh! Yes, sir! I guess you wanna
know my story too, huh?

184
00:12:42,968 --> 00:12:45,170
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, now, Mr. Borlund.

185
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:47,006
A little friendly talk
to help the time pass by.

186
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,173
Ain't that true?

187
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:49,975
- Thanks.
- You want me to call you Max?

188
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:56,482
I think Mr. Borlund
will do just fine.

189
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:59,118
Mr. Borlund it is.

190
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:01,320
See now, the thing with Elijah
here is real simple.

191
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:03,222
He wasn't an army man.

192
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:06,358
See, where I come from,
a new bed,

193
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:09,828
clean clothes, a good horse,
and three square meals a day

194
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:11,363
sounded like a mighty fine deal.

195
00:13:11,397 --> 00:13:13,533
I joined up in the army
when I was 17.

196
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,436
The captain, he filled me in
about you too now, sir.

197
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:21,173
Captain say you either a
Dutchman, or a Swede, or a...

198
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:22,609
a German or something such.

199
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:25,077
Captain say you used to be
a soldier some time way back.

200
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,579
Ain't too sure about
which army, though.

201
00:13:26,613 --> 00:13:28,615
- Mm-hmm.
- Mind telling me?

202
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,251
Is you a Dutchman or a Swede?
Whatever?

203
00:13:32,284 --> 00:13:34,853
Not at all. I'm an American.

204
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:42,194
(insects buzzing)

205
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:50,869
(gunshot)

206
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,508
You know, uh...

207
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,244
You've been acting real jumpy
the last few days.

208
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:00,979
(axe striking)

209
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:04,517
I've come to realize...

210
00:14:06,485 --> 00:14:09,188
...my whole life, I've done
impulsive things.

211
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,992
They don't always work out.
(axe striking)

212
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:18,130
Got a reserve of 20 bullets.

213
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,100
I'm gonna use another five
to practice.

214
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,537
I keep being told this is
a dangerous country.

215
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,244
(gunshot)

216
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:33,412
(horse neighing)

217
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:39,985
I'll never give them the
pleasure of watching me cry.

218
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:43,590
Good. Yeah, I like that.

219
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,291
We did what we done.

220
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,961
And we just saying
to all of them,

221
00:14:48,994 --> 00:14:50,429
"Piss upon ya.

222
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:53,165
Go straight to hell."

223
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,608
(gunshot)
(glass breaking)

224
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:08,080
(insects chirping)

225
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:11,618
I was sent here by Tiberio
because my English is good.

226
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,485
Very good, as you can tell.

227
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:18,390
Let me begin saying I am honored
to meet you, Mrs. Kidd.

228
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:21,460
Obviously, a very kind and
beautiful woman.

229
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,264
I say thank you, Mr. Romero.

230
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,232
But maybe you should get
to the point.

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,268
Why are you here?

232
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:32,404
Oh. I'm here to represent
Tiberio Vargas,

233
00:15:32,438 --> 00:15:35,441
and to give response
to the financial offer

234
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,443
made to him by Señor Hannon.

235
00:15:37,476 --> 00:15:39,111
Let us review the facts.

236
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:41,346
We don't have to do
this business here and now,

237
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,682
in front of these people.

238
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,685
Mr. Hannon owes Tiberio Vargas

239
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,587
several thousand dollars
in gambling debt.

240
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,157
Hold on, goddamn it!
This is between me and Tiberio.

241
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:56,261
To retire the debt, Mr. Hannon
has offered Tiberio Vargas

242
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:59,732
$5,000 of Mrs. Kidd's
ransom money,

243
00:15:59,766 --> 00:16:03,135
in return for your safe passage
to Veracruz and then Cuba.

244
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,439
Goddamn it. You son
of a bitch, you sold us out.

245
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,008
All right...

246
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,411
I needed money.

247
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:16,616
The two of you, you eat up
my food, sleep all hours.

248
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,450
You don't pay shit for rent.

249
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:23,756
And worst of all, I gotta deal
with this hell cat of yours

250
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,726
complaining all the time
about how dirty it is

251
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:31,263
for her dainty self and that I
live like a goddamn bindlestiff!

252
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:33,666
I don't see why I gotta
put up with this shit

253
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,735
from this rich bitch whore

254
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:37,604
without getting paid
royal for it!

255
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,239
(sighing)

256
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:48,815
I've decided...
the price for room and board

257
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:52,451
for these two runaways
is $2,500.

258
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:56,455
Everybody in this deal
is guaranteed something.

259
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:58,457
Everybody benefits.

260
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:01,594
I'll tell you about guarantees.

261
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,228
I'll guarantee you this.

262
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:06,599
I am not a whore.

263
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,334
(tense music)

264
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:32,224
A message is sent
to Tiberio by Señor Hannon.

265
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,828
His offer proposes that Tiberio,
for $5,000,

266
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:40,567
will guarantee safe conduct for
you and Mrs. Kidd to Veracruz.

267
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,636
I have come here to
tell you that

268
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,506
Tiberio accepts your proposal.

269
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,440
(insects chirping)

270
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,744
Maybe this actually works.

271
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:56,248
Sure, we lose some money, but...
it gets us a clean getaway.

272
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:02,487
(♪)

273
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:10,362
(wolf howling)

274
00:18:19,906 --> 00:18:21,507
(grunting)

275
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:27,412
Mr. Borlund.

276
00:18:36,254 --> 00:18:39,157
Outlaws?
- Until proven differently.

277
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:50,903
(horse neighing)

278
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:00,580
Greetings.

279
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:03,716
This is Señor Tiberio Vargas,

280
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,418
I am Esteban Romero,
at your service.

281
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,253
I will translate.

282
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:12,190
Señor Vargas is a very important
and generous man.

283
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:15,360
Ten years ago, he sent me
to Monterrey to study law.

284
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:18,397
(Tiberio, in Spanish):

285
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,810
(in English): As you can see,
Tiberio is hunting,

286
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:32,779
entertaining his guest and
business associate,

287
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:34,479
Señor Palmer.

288
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:37,583
Señor Palmer has come
all the way from London

289
00:19:37,617 --> 00:19:39,585
to do business with Tiberio.

290
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,888
- Really?
- Uh, Tiberio says

291
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:43,756
that the land
you're travelling through,

292
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,759
the water you're helping
yourselves to is all his,

293
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:51,496
and as a result, there is a fee
to be paid for safe passage.

294
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:54,834
(in Spanish):

295
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:56,703
(in English):
Tiberio is not happy.

296
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,806
He says force
could possibly be used.

297
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,373
He has many guns.

298
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:04,811
So do we. Tiberio will be
the first one to be shot.

299
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:07,814
If you allow me, sir,
I don't mean to interfere,

300
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:10,883
but it might not be wise
to contest this issue.

301
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:14,286
Now, if you want my opinion...
- I don't.

302
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:19,424
Mr. Poe!
- That'll be me, sir.

303
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:21,359
(gun cocking)
Armed and ready.

304
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:24,262
(in Spanish):

305
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:27,600
(in English): Down here,
the gringos are not the boss.

306
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,603
- So you do speak English.
- Only when I want.

307
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,674
(tense music)

308
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,342
(horse neighing)

309
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:43,381
Who the hell are you?

310
00:20:44,584 --> 00:20:46,919
I'm the fella with the gun.
Who the hell is you?

311
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,888
I go by Jack Tyree.

312
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:51,023
Looks like you a long way
from home, Jack.

313
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,026
I'm giving you advice, amigo.

314
00:20:54,994 --> 00:20:59,297
Clear on out of here. Tiberio
don't kill you, I just might.

315
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:02,334
I don't much like me some damned
smart mouthed fucker.

316
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:10,308
So, what's it gonna be?

317
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,410
How do you want to play it?

318
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,916
(wind howling)

319
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:19,284
(insects buzzing)

320
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,626
(in Spanish):

321
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,697
(in English): Tiberio asks if
you, like so many others,

322
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,566
are here to seek gold.

323
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,467
We all work for money.

324
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,435
(in Spanish):

325
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:43,441
(neighing)

326
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:46,779
(in English): Well, sir,
my name is William Palmer.

327
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:49,381
I just wish to say that
your good fortune matches

328
00:21:49,414 --> 00:21:50,883
your obstinate stupidity.

329
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,485
<i>- Vamos, vamos!</i>
- Good day.

330
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:55,521
Yah!

331
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,359
You find gold,
you must share it with Tiberio.

332
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:04,664
Otherwise, I guarantee
the consequences will be

333
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:06,566
extremely unpleasant.

334
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:09,702
(♪)

335
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:17,710
(neighing)

336
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:19,946
(indistinct shouting)

337
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:24,382
I don't think we made
a new friend.

338
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:28,921
(insects buzzing)

339
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:38,030
(in Spanish):

340
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:48,406
(indistinct chatter)

341
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:54,747
(laughing)

342
00:22:55,514 --> 00:22:57,083
(bartender speaking Spanish)

343
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,589
(in English): Do you wish
for a meal or a room?

344
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:04,957
I reckon I need both.

345
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:07,159
Ah. How long are you
gonna stay, Señor?

346
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:10,529
Ah, a couple of weeks.
Maybe more, <i>quién sabe.</i>

347
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,665
Ah, we've got lots of rooms.

348
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,735
(speaking Spanish)

349
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,469
(in English): I give you
the best one.

350
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:20,172
Looks to be kind of quiet
around here.

351
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,807
You know, we have this town.

352
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:23,843
People still come here
to gamble.

353
00:23:24,476 --> 00:23:26,612
Tiberio Vargas y <i>sus hombres,</i>

354
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,514
they come here, they gamble.

355
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:31,183
We still have <i>rucas.</i>
<i>Buenas rucas.</i>

356
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:34,452
We have the house dealer,
Sylvio, an honest man.

357
00:23:35,087 --> 00:23:37,857
Right now, that's just
what the doctor ordered.

358
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,393
Gonna suit me right down
to the ground.

359
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,529
Joe Cribbens, at your service.

360
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:46,165
<i>Entonces...</i> What,
you are a businessman?

361
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:50,903
I retired. I just like
to play cards and...

362
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:52,605
stay out of trouble.

363
00:23:53,506 --> 00:23:55,608
(♪)

364
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:03,049
(insects chirping)

365
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:11,724
See them two horses down
there? Them is army horses.

366
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,693
The map worked out.

367
00:24:14,593 --> 00:24:16,095
We got 'em, Mr. Borlund.

368
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,064
We got 'em with the element
of surprise.

369
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:24,070
The map was correct.
Very good, Mr. Poe. Very good.

370
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,539
I aim to please.

371
00:24:27,606 --> 00:24:29,642
(soft music)

372
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:38,017
(cards rustling)

373
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:01,707
Don't seem
to be any luck. Shit.

374
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:05,177
You got a bad temper, Jack.

375
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:09,048
The other night,
you were way out of hand.

376
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,252
You ought a get it under control.

377
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:16,122
I still can't accept... (gasping)

378
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:19,158
(gasps)

379
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:25,131
Elijah, don't!
I wouldn't try anything foolish.

380
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:26,732
Walk away from that gun.

381
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:29,068
(Hannon): No, no, no, no!
This ain't part of the deal!

382
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:30,603
This is my private fucking...

383
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:33,205
Oh, Mr. Hannon, keep
your arms up and stay quiet!

384
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,807
- Who are you?
- Go easy now, ma'am,

385
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,043
a lot of guns in here.
- Damn you, I asked who are you.

386
00:25:37,076 --> 00:25:38,344
Just what do you think
you're doing?

387
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,046
We're here on full legal
authority, Mrs. Kidd.

388
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,981
That, and me and Elijah here
are old friends.

389
00:25:42,014 --> 00:25:44,850
Alonzo, you done gone over,
you done sold me out?

390
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:47,753
Yep! Turns out I'm just a good
old army man, ain't that right?

391
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:49,789
You're the only damn person
in the regiment I trusted!

392
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:51,957
You let me down, brother!
- You let yourself down

393
00:25:51,991 --> 00:25:54,060
with this dumb-ass plan.
That and getting caught up

394
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:55,728
with this silly-ass white woman.

395
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,597
One thing is for certain,
I ain't going back to Texas

396
00:25:58,631 --> 00:26:00,299
with some bounty man!

397
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:01,667
(breathing heavily)

398
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,035
I got a rope waiting for me.

399
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:05,304
Get the hell gone
or I'll kill her, sure as hell!

400
00:26:05,337 --> 00:26:07,139
He's not after you,
he's after us.

401
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,340
- Bullshit!
- Goddamn...

402
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:09,708
(gunshot)

403
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:11,010
(gasping)

404
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,615
(breathing heavily)

405
00:26:23,422 --> 00:26:24,690
You killed him.

406
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:26,125
Yes, I did.

407
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,261
You're gonna bury him,
Mr. Jones.

408
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:33,833
Max Borlund. Ma'am.

409
00:26:35,167 --> 00:26:37,937
I've been hired by your husband
to take you home.

410
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,074
(grunting)

411
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:53,886
(panting)

412
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,065
You see the mess
you done got yourself in?

413
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:08,934
You ain't nothing
but a damn stupid fool.

414
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:16,675
(grunting)

415
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:21,080
I'm not grateful
for your mission here.

416
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:25,050
But I should thank you
for possibly saving my life.

417
00:27:26,018 --> 00:27:27,887
Hannon was a foolish man.

418
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,189
Mr. Hannon was
a treacherous man.

419
00:27:32,024 --> 00:27:33,826
Get yourself together,
Mrs. Kidd,

420
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,295
and whatever you need,
we ride within the hour.

421
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:41,000
I suppose I need
to surrender my gun.

422
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,402
I keep a derringer in my valise.

423
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:51,810
I'm doing this because
Elijah might

424
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,879
try to do something foolish.

425
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,148
I wouldn't want
to see him killed.

426
00:27:57,449 --> 00:27:59,451
I'd feel more than
partially responsible

427
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:01,120
if he came to any harm.

428
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:05,257
Deserted the army,
attempted extortion.

429
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,092
He's coming in
for a lot of harm.

430
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:10,496
Maybe the easiest way out
of this mess is to shoot you.

431
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,998
And solve at least
some of my problems.

432
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:16,168
I don't think that's such
a good idea, Mrs. Kidd.

433
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:30,349
Mr. Borlund,
I have a question.

434
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:35,988
Are you under the impression
that you are rescuing me?

435
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:38,057
I was told
that you were abducted.

436
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:40,125
That was a lie.

437
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,128
I've also been told that
by Sergeant Poe.

438
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:47,833
(insects buzzing)

439
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:50,269
(♪)

440
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,789
(distant wolf howling)

441
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:16,996
(fire crackling)

442
00:29:28,608 --> 00:29:29,542
(clears throat)

443
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,245
When you killed Mr. Hannon
back at his cabin...

444
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,179
Mm-hmm.

445
00:29:35,347 --> 00:29:38,150
Your bullets missed
my head by inches.

446
00:29:38,183 --> 00:29:39,251
Mm-hmm.

447
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,322
You're that confident
in your marksmanship?

448
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,057
No.

449
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:51,163
Thought you was my friend.

450
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:54,567
You went and turned
your back on me.

451
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,407
Now, you listen to me, brother.

452
00:30:02,274 --> 00:30:03,576
This thing ain't over yet.

453
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,579
I might just be able
to get you out of this mess

454
00:30:06,613 --> 00:30:08,080
you done put yourself in.

455
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:10,883
Oh, and let me say this.

456
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:14,153
I still think it's a good idea
you and the army is finished.

457
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:17,256
You wasn't exactly
the soldier type of fella.

458
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:20,492
I go along with the notion
seeing it's a real good idea

459
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,329
that you end up in Cuba
some such. You hear me?

460
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,899
Maybe you ought a hear this.

461
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,902
I got me and Rachel
an insurance policy.

462
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,171
His name is Tiberio.

463
00:30:34,473 --> 00:30:36,041
You know I'm married.

464
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,547
Certainly, you know I've run off
with a man of color.

465
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,483
I expect you think you have me
pretty well figured out.

466
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,957
Your husband hired me to take
you back across the border.

467
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,226
Beyond that, I have no opinion.

468
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:57,597
Martin Kidd is not simply
a bad husband.

469
00:30:58,598 --> 00:31:00,966
He's also a very bad man.

470
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:05,270
Not everyone I work for
is a saint.

471
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,408
I took a job and I intend
to earn my money.

472
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:12,579
You live by a code?

473
00:31:13,145 --> 00:31:14,246
I try.

474
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,014
You ever question it?

475
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:18,016
Not often.

476
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:20,587
Got a wife?

477
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:29,629
I don't think I'm a good fit
for the whole idea.

478
00:31:29,662 --> 00:31:30,929
Yeah, well...

479
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:33,566
Excuse me, I gotta see
Mr. Poe.

480
00:31:38,971 --> 00:31:41,006
(distant wolf howling)

481
00:31:44,376 --> 00:31:46,613
Go get something to eat,
I'll relieve you.

482
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:49,415
You can spell me
in four hours, I'll wake you.

483
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:52,050
I got some information
about Elijah.

484
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:53,485
The goddamn fool done made
some type of deal

485
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,920
with that Tiberio fella.

486
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:58,558
Does... Does Mrs. Kidd
know that?

487
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:02,060
I don't know for sure,
but I expect so.

488
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:07,667
(soft music)

489
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,204
Very interesting game, poker.

490
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:14,507
Sometimes, it's hard to figure

491
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:18,177
when the man's bluffing
or when he's got the goods.

492
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,212
(William): So far,
you seem to be on your game.

493
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,552
You know, I like to know

494
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,453
the name of the people
I play cards with. That way,

495
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,087
when they take my money,
it makes it that little

496
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,389
bit more friendly.

497
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,424
You played here
for an hour and a half,

498
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,561
and not knowing my name
didn't seem to bother you

499
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,028
until I started winning.

500
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:37,597
Well, you do show some signs

501
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,264
of being a professional
card shark.

502
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:40,733
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:44,537
I'll take that
as a sign of respect.

504
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,539
Well, it wasn't meant
in that spirit.

505
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,273
Now, I'd like to have a name,

506
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:49,709
unless it's something
you're ashamed of.

507
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:51,511
(dealer speaking Spanish)
One card.

508
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:52,745
Sure thing, amigo.

509
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,015
But I want to be real polite.

510
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:58,250
You first.

511
00:32:58,651 --> 00:33:01,721
With pleasure.
William Palmer Esquire,

512
00:33:01,754 --> 00:33:03,155
firm purchase agent for the

513
00:33:03,188 --> 00:33:04,791
Turnbull Mining
Properties Limited.

514
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:07,192
Offices in London, Manchester,
and New Orleans.

515
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:09,995
Around here, they refer to me
as Guillermo Inglés.

516
00:33:10,362 --> 00:33:13,365
English Bill.
Long way from home.

517
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:14,500
Indeed.

518
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:17,503
And you are?

519
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,440
Joe Cribbens. I'm from Texas.

520
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:29,081
You seem to be a man of strong
opinions, English Bill.

521
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:31,416
Mr. Palmer, if you please.

522
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,186
Now, let me put you on notice,
Mr. Cribbens.

523
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:35,822
I'm a very, very good
card player.

524
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:38,423
I do not intend to be taken in
by any tricks of your trade

525
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:41,059
because I am not a man
to be taken advantage of.

526
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:44,062
I can defend myself adequately
here in this rough terrain.

527
00:33:44,096 --> 00:33:46,198
I'm also here on business
with Mr. Tiberio Vargas,

528
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:47,534
who, as you must certainly know,

529
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,536
is lord of all he surveys
in these parts.

530
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:55,808
Now, since I think you're just
another bullshit Englishman,

531
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:58,511
the kind of fella
we gringos have already

532
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:00,647
whipped twice in two wars...

533
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:04,483
Why don't we cut the blabber

534
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:07,152
and just concentrate
on playing cards?

535
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,358
Well, hell!

536
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,598
English Bill. Your luck's bound
to change sometime.

537
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,500
So, I guess I'll call.

538
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:24,837
With... two itty-bitty pairs.

539
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:29,374
Son of a bitch.

540
00:34:29,408 --> 00:34:31,476
Some fellas just can't get
away with a bluff.

541
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,478
They lack the character for it.

542
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,379
I'll tell you this
Mr. Cribbens,

543
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:36,248
you're damn lucky
I'm not wearing a gun.

544
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:38,116
And I'll tell you this,
English Bill.

545
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,319
You're damn lucky
I don't put a bullet up your ass

546
00:34:40,352 --> 00:34:41,888
just on general principle.

547
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:46,859
Now, if I was you,
I'd get out of my sight,

548
00:34:46,893 --> 00:34:49,461
before I run through
all my good humor.

549
00:34:50,195 --> 00:34:51,564
(sighing)

550
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:08,648
(♪)

551
00:35:24,564 --> 00:35:27,466
(soft Spanish song)

552
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:33,673
(in Spanish):

553
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:03,703
(in English): I have
a fugitive of the law,

554
00:36:03,736 --> 00:36:07,172
army deserter and extortionist.

555
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:15,515
I am Max Borlund representing
the United States army.

556
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,850
And I am Captain
Miguel A rag on.

557
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,886
Chief Magistrate
of Trinidad Maria.

558
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,453
At your service.

559
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:23,923
- Who's the woman?
- I have a name.

560
00:36:25,024 --> 00:36:27,225
Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

561
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:30,362
You can put the prisoner
in a cell and send a telegram

562
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:32,965
to the territorial deputy
in Santa Fe saying that you have

563
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,902
a Private Elijah Jones
in your custody.

564
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:38,336
You have no jurisdiction here.

565
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,606
Yes. But your country's law

566
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,809
doesn't permit deserters
of foreign armies

567
00:36:42,842 --> 00:36:44,610
to find safe haven.

568
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:47,947
There's an honorable tradition
of extraditing men

569
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,682
who come here
with bad intentions.

570
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:50,950
Maybe you ought a
hear this, Captain.

571
00:36:51,718 --> 00:36:55,353
You lock me up, Tiberio Vargas
might not like it one damn bit.

572
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:56,856
- Tiberio Vargas?
- Uh-huh. Me and him

573
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:59,826
were talking business before
this bounty man showed up.

574
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,963
By the way, he killed a man.
Jack Hannon.

575
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,268
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

576
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:15,007
American. Wanted criminal
who resisted arrest.

577
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:17,476
They're witnesses.
- Yes.

578
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,881
Mr. Borlund killed Mr. Hannon
after he put a gun to my head.

579
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,417
Mr. Borlund probably
saved my life.

580
00:37:27,754 --> 00:37:29,421
(in Spanish):

581
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:33,793
(in English): We are officers
of the law.

582
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,294
We will lock him up.

583
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,508
Can't say I didn't do nothing
for you, brother.

584
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,475
(grunts)

585
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,477
Yeah, real goddamn funny.
(chuckles)

586
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,346
Well, I'll check in on you
every now and then,

587
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:55,748
make sure they're
feeding you proper.

588
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:04,991
Mr. Borlund,
a word in private.

589
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,673
I'm sorry, Elijah.

590
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,776
None of this
is turning out right.

591
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:27,479
Yeah. Gotta admit,

592
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,749
Cuba's looking real far away.

593
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,789
My government expects me
to protect lives and property.

594
00:38:36,823 --> 00:38:39,025
If Tiberio Vargas becomes angry,

595
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:41,127
or attempts to profit
from this situation,

596
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,762
there could be trouble.

597
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:45,531
This town is under
my jurisdiction,

598
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:48,100
but out there, Tiberio is king.

599
00:38:49,101 --> 00:38:51,737
There are those who come here
and then break the law.

600
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:53,639
Two gringos.

601
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:56,075
They were robbing local farmers,
hiding up in the mountains.

602
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:58,744
Tiberio and his men
hunted them down.

603
00:38:58,778 --> 00:39:01,147
I let them hang
for two weeks after that.

604
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,082
The smell gets very bad.

605
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:04,951
Did you give them a trial?

606
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:08,521
It wasn't necessary.

607
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:18,931
(Max): You should go over to the
hotel and get yourself a room.

608
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:25,538
Unfortunately, I am without
sufficient funds.

609
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,873
Yeah, I'll take care of that

610
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,008
after I send a telegram
to your husband.

611
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:37,083
(Poe): See all this mess
you done caused?

612
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:39,151
Runaway woman,

613
00:39:39,185 --> 00:39:42,688
bounty hunter,
price on your head...

614
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:46,659
And believe me, for sure,
they'd rather see you dead.

615
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:48,828
Guess I was better off
in the army all those years

616
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,563
taking nothing but shit.

617
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,132
And knowing if I quit the army,

618
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:56,501
I ain't got much chance
of doing nothing else.

619
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:59,071
Except shining shoes
or serving food.

620
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,041
Well no, sir.

621
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,877
No thank you.

622
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:16,656
(in Spanish):

623
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:25,932
(♪)

624
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,875
(sighs)

625
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:49,055
(in English):
Do you speak English?

626
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:50,523
I do, Señor.

627
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,490
Mrs. Kidd will need a room

628
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:56,494
for a few days, maybe more.
I need a room as well.

629
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:00,700
Number four, at the top
of those stairs.

630
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:02,134
Thank you.

631
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,071
You have number two,
across the hallway.

632
00:41:05,104 --> 00:41:07,106
- Thanks.
- Señor.

633
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,080
I suppose I should say
thank you,

634
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:16,682
but then I remember
who you're working for.

635
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,086
It doesn't seem right,

636
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,188
Elijah being treated
like a criminal,

637
00:41:22,221 --> 00:41:24,023
and I'm put up in a nice hotel.

638
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:28,561
Elijah left the army,
that makes him a deserter.

639
00:41:28,594 --> 00:41:32,064
You left your marriage.
No one goes to jail for that.

640
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:43,209
(♪)

641
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,752
(door opens)

642
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,255
Ah, there he is.

643
00:41:56,288 --> 00:42:00,226
Joe Cribbens.
Professional card shark.

644
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,596
See, I've been considering
our card game,

645
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:05,031
and I believe you cheated me.

646
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,867
I don't need to cheat
to beat you, amigo.

647
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,870
Well, this time, I brought
my service revolver

648
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,173
and I fully intend on dealing
with the situation.

649
00:42:14,206 --> 00:42:17,176
Now, I suggest you give me
back my money

650
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:19,945
and throw in a few extra
shillings for good measure.

651
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:23,149
(gunfire)

652
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:25,117
(glass shattering)

653
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:33,025
(♪)

654
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:37,263
Goddamn Englishman
went and committed suicide.

655
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,947
(sighs)

656
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,283
(knocking on door)

657
00:42:57,316 --> 00:42:59,218
Esperanza, you can come in.

658
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:02,855
I thought I picked...
Oh, I'm sorry.

659
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,890
- No, come in.
- What I wanted to discuss...

660
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:06,358
I said come in.

661
00:43:11,664 --> 00:43:14,333
As you can see, I'm trying
to take a bath.

662
00:43:14,366 --> 00:43:16,669
My first real one in weeks.

663
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:21,340
What's the matter?

664
00:43:21,373 --> 00:43:22,908
You suspect I'm a whore,

665
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:24,810
I supposed I might
as well act like one.

666
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,781
Are you getting nervous?

667
00:43:30,116 --> 00:43:32,785
Maybe, like most men,

668
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,956
you're just scared to death of
really dealing with a woman.

669
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,691
Are you finished?

670
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,063
I came to let you know
that tomorrow

671
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:46,098
I'll start making arrangements

672
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:48,167
to have you taken back
across the border.

673
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:52,371
My life is done there.

674
00:43:52,404 --> 00:43:55,007
I have to move on, not go back.

675
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,309
I appreciate your concern,

676
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,311
but I will be the one
to figure out my life.

677
00:44:00,913 --> 00:44:01,947
Mm-hmm.

678
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,685
You refuse to go?

679
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,787
I refuse to go.

680
00:44:09,421 --> 00:44:11,690
Even at gun point.

681
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,164
If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

682
00:44:21,767 --> 00:44:22,868
(door closes)

683
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,405
(Alonzo): As you have been told,

684
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:28,307
I'm here representing
Tiberio Vargas.

685
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,143
He has already heard about this
unfortunate incident.

686
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:34,413
Look, this man tried
to kill me, came here to do it.

687
00:44:34,446 --> 00:44:37,716
Most likely a real shit heel
in general.

688
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:40,052
I figured I was doing
everybody a favor.

689
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:43,722
We need no favors,
but possibly you do.

690
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:46,258
This man you killed
was doing serious business

691
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:47,493
with Tiberio Vargas.

692
00:44:47,527 --> 00:44:50,129
Tiberio Vargas,
I keep hearing the name.

693
00:44:50,162 --> 00:44:52,831
Mmm, you do not want him
for an enemy.

694
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,276
Joe Cribbens.

695
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:10,349
Name's not Joseph.
Just Joe will cover the deal.

696
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,118
I was Texas, born and bred.

697
00:45:13,152 --> 00:45:15,522
Been knocking around
since I was 15.

698
00:45:15,555 --> 00:45:17,957
Worked Teamster, worked Trooper.

699
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,758
Drifted some.

700
00:45:19,792 --> 00:45:21,827
I always liked playing cards.

701
00:45:23,128 --> 00:45:26,098
Tell me why you shot
this Englishman.

702
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,537
I beat him at cards.
I beat him fair and square.

703
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,404
He didn't take it too good.

704
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,140
Guess I just turned out
to be the better man.

705
00:45:35,174 --> 00:45:38,277
Luis agrees the Englishman
shot first.

706
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:43,282
He's an honest man.
Tiberio will consider all this.

707
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:45,184
You must wait here in Guadalupe

708
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:47,453
while Tiberio makes
his decision.

709
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:51,524
Damn. My luck's run bad.

710
00:45:57,229 --> 00:45:59,398
(soft piano melody)

711
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:55,387
Mr. Borlund. We meet again.

712
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:58,891
This time, I'm happy to say
I'm not sitting in a bathtub.

713
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:00,560
Do you have news?

714
00:47:00,593 --> 00:47:03,028
I was just informed
a few minutes ago

715
00:47:03,062 --> 00:47:06,365
by Captain A rag on that
your husband is on his way here,

716
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:08,300
he's travelling by coach.

717
00:47:08,334 --> 00:47:11,837
I am to watch over you
until he arrives.

718
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,613
A very bad situation
now made worse.

719
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:24,016
(piano melody continues)

720
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:28,253
The last time we talked,

721
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:31,023
I was extremely short-tempered.
I apologize.

722
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,559
No apology necessary.

723
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:37,329
I've decided you need to be in
greater possession of the facts.

724
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:39,532
I believe you need
to know my story.

725
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:43,969
It begins with
a well-off family.

726
00:47:44,002 --> 00:47:46,506
I'm the youngest
of three sisters,

727
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:49,074
educated by a series
of governesses.

728
00:47:49,642 --> 00:47:53,112
Rebellious. Didn't get along
with anybody much,

729
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:55,481
including my parents
and my sisters.

730
00:47:56,716 --> 00:48:01,153
Fell in love at 17.
It was quite passionate.

731
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:06,024
I've always resisted
traditional morality.

732
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:11,096
My mother once told me,
"You only fall completely

733
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,234
in love once, and usually,
when you're very young."

734
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:19,572
She also told me,
"Almost no woman ends up

735
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:21,206
with her first choice."

736
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,143
Five years later,
I met Martin Kidd.

737
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:28,447
He was charming, ambitious,

738
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,551
seemed very rich,
and he was from the west.

739
00:48:32,752 --> 00:48:35,988
I desperately wanted to get away
from where I grew up.

740
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:39,158
We had a quick romance, and four
weeks later, we were married.

741
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:41,260
We went to live
in his home in Santa Fe.

742
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:46,031
Then, the horror started.

743
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:50,068
I discovered he's a crook,

744
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:55,207
a conniver, an extortionist,
a land cheat.

745
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,376
He constantly consorted
with other women,

746
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:59,144
usually prostitutes.

747
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:03,148
I was reduced to being
that which I most despise,

748
00:49:03,182 --> 00:49:05,451
a decoration wife.

749
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:12,224
To my shame, I took all of it
and more for five years.

750
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:16,161
There were endless fights
with Martin.

751
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:20,700
Finally, he condescendingly
allowed me to start a school.

752
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:25,037
I taught those who had very
little advantage in life, and...

753
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:30,042
And as time passed,
I eventually became

754
00:49:30,075 --> 00:49:33,378
more than a teacher
with one of my students.

755
00:49:33,412 --> 00:49:35,247
Elijah Jones.

756
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:39,051
Elijah Jones.

757
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:42,789
He had his own set of problems.

758
00:49:42,822 --> 00:49:46,659
I was sympathetic.
One thing led to another.

759
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:50,229
Eventually, we realized escape
was our only recourse.

760
00:49:50,262 --> 00:49:52,498
So we made a plan to run off.

761
00:49:53,298 --> 00:49:54,634
And did.

762
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:58,504
I suppose you know the rest.

763
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,375
He's a good person.

764
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,514
And often, a great comfort to
me, but we are very different.

765
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,414
We have no future together.

766
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:13,285
We've had some good times,
but eventually,

767
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:15,788
we will go our separate ways.
We both know it.

768
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:17,757
Probably sooner than later.

769
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:22,294
If I'm being completely honest,

770
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:26,164
Elijah was not the first
of my romantic adventures

771
00:50:26,198 --> 00:50:27,734
since I married Martin.

772
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:31,370
Most were in simple retaliation.

773
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,577
Well, I think I've done
enough confessing.

774
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,683
I want you to think of me
as an honest person.

775
00:50:44,684 --> 00:50:46,586
However, imperfect.

776
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,721
I want you to think of me
as an honest person,

777
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,089
because I believe
that matters to you.

778
00:50:51,123 --> 00:50:55,093
I just want to say this,
for the record.

779
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:02,735
When my husband gets here,
he intends to kill me.

780
00:51:07,507 --> 00:51:09,842
(snoring)

781
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:13,211
(barking in the distance)

782
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:16,583
I know you heard
Mrs. Kidd and the others

783
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:17,784
can't come visit you.

784
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:21,788
Anybody bother giving a reason?

785
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:23,856
Just when we're kicking
the balls for Elijah.

786
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,660
Captain A rag on said the bounty
man and me has jurisdiction.

787
00:51:27,694 --> 00:51:30,162
Ain't nobody else allowed.
- Yeah.

788
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:33,198
Just one more kick
in the balls, huh.

789
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:35,300
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

790
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:36,769
It don't help a damn thing.

791
00:51:37,704 --> 00:51:40,640
And you know Mr. Kidd himself
is on the way up here right now.

792
00:51:41,206 --> 00:51:42,341
(sighing)

793
00:51:42,374 --> 00:51:44,142
Yeah.

794
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,178
Oh yeah, I heard.

795
00:51:46,646 --> 00:51:49,147
Captain A rag on told me.

796
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:51,517
You know, I just figure
he's bringing the ransom money

797
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:53,586
in a... personal way.

798
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,154
More likely he coming up
to settle things with you.

799
00:51:56,188 --> 00:51:57,924
Now, I gotta figure out a way
how I'm a bust you up

800
00:51:57,957 --> 00:52:00,325
out of here and get you on your
way to some half-ass freedom.

801
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,294
Now first...

802
00:52:02,629 --> 00:52:04,262
And you gotta do this...

803
00:52:05,932 --> 00:52:07,800
Forget this white woman.

804
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:09,669
You travelling with her,
you get spotted

805
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:11,738
real easy and you finished.

806
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:14,306
Plus, I gotta figure out a way
how I'm gonna stay clean.

807
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:15,908
Because I plans to be
going back home,

808
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:17,844
- and I'm going back to the army.
- That's what it is.

809
00:52:17,877 --> 00:52:20,212
Don't let nothing interfere
with what's good for Alonzo Poe.

810
00:52:20,245 --> 00:52:21,480
You goddamn right!

811
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:22,749
Because I sure as shit
ain't finna go

812
00:52:22,782 --> 00:52:24,349
outlaw for a dumb-ass like you.

813
00:52:24,383 --> 00:52:26,318
You've already caused me
enough grief.

814
00:52:26,953 --> 00:52:28,387
(sighing)

815
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,690
Now, keep your mouth shut,
keep your eyes open,

816
00:52:30,723 --> 00:52:32,759
and boy, you better pray...

817
00:52:32,792 --> 00:52:34,861
that I can do you
some real good.

818
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:41,266
(♪)

819
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,771
(door closing)

820
00:52:46,572 --> 00:52:48,373
Mr. Borlund,

821
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:50,375
I figured I'd take
the horses out for exercise.

822
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,645
Wanna keep 'em fit.
(grunts)

823
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:54,580
Very good, Mr. Poe.

824
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:56,281
Yes, sir.

825
00:52:56,683 --> 00:52:57,984
(sighing)

826
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:00,452
Boots and saddle, slap leather
and ride.

827
00:53:00,485 --> 00:53:01,521
That's our motto.

828
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:02,655
(chuckling)

829
00:53:02,689 --> 00:53:05,591
I'm a cavalry man.
So I sticks to it.

830
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:09,194
- Sergeant Poe.
- Yes, sir.

831
00:53:10,697 --> 00:53:13,231
With the prisoner
Elijah Jones...

832
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,333
Yes, sir.

833
00:53:15,802 --> 00:53:17,436
Don't do anything stupid

834
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:19,906
like try to break him out
of jail and set him free.

835
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:22,207
Yes, sir.

836
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:24,342
Why would you think that?

837
00:53:24,376 --> 00:53:25,578
Because you're not as clever

838
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:27,880
and I'm not as stupid
as you imagine.

839
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,418
Yes, sir. I mean... No, sir.

840
00:53:37,623 --> 00:53:39,025
(sighing)

841
00:53:39,058 --> 00:53:42,227
The time to do it
is when step back to the border.

842
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:46,799
Now I'm a little
confused here. Uh...

843
00:53:49,702 --> 00:53:51,303
You mean...

844
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:53,873
I mean, this whole job is a lie

845
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:55,575
and it started as a lie.

846
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:58,745
I don't like being lied to
and I don't like being used.

847
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,615
You're gonna help me
let Elijah go?

848
00:54:02,648 --> 00:54:03,916
You have my word.

849
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,818
Well, sir...

850
00:54:07,385 --> 00:54:09,021
Sure is full of surprises.

851
00:54:09,055 --> 00:54:10,056
Yeah.

852
00:54:10,089 --> 00:54:11,791
(barking)

853
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:14,894
(gallops of horses)

854
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,495
Look who's coming.

855
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:28,508
Tiberio wants to start
negotiating about Elijah.

856
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,014
Yeah, I'll handle the diplomacy.

857
00:54:35,047 --> 00:54:36,883
You go and cause
a little trouble.

858
00:54:36,916 --> 00:54:39,919
I don't want Tiberio
to think we're pushover.

859
00:54:39,952 --> 00:54:41,721
(Poe): How about I go tell
Mr. Peckerwood

860
00:54:41,754 --> 00:54:42,955
over there a thing or two?

861
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:44,891
Seeing that he was
kind of insulting me...

862
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:47,459
Yeah, go ahead.

863
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,762
Try not to kill him.

864
00:54:49,796 --> 00:54:51,030
Yes, sir.

865
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:53,833
I'll go have a drink
and wait for Esteban.

866
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,340
(in Spanish):

867
00:55:23,696 --> 00:55:25,898
(in English): Well,
howdy, Tyree.

868
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:27,600
Say, you remember me, right?

869
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,135
The fellow with the gun?

870
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:31,771
Yeah. Out there
at the water hole.

871
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:33,039
That's right.

872
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:35,440
I see you still got
a real smart mouth.

873
00:55:35,808 --> 00:55:37,810
You need to learn some manners.

874
00:55:37,844 --> 00:55:41,047
Maybe I ought to bullwhip me
a real uppity fella.

875
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,448
Just might do you some good.

876
00:55:45,651 --> 00:55:48,821
Now, Jack, I know you ain't
the smartest man I ever met,

877
00:55:49,956 --> 00:55:53,926
but maybe you forgot that
I'm the one carrying the gun.

878
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,460
Yeah, well...

879
00:55:56,062 --> 00:55:58,097
Go ahead and shoot me.

880
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,497
And those fellows over there...

881
00:56:00,633 --> 00:56:02,835
...well, they'll shoot you.

882
00:56:05,503 --> 00:56:08,373
Señor Borlund,
we meet another time.

883
00:56:09,942 --> 00:56:14,013
I'm afraid Tiberio has now heard
you're a bounty man, yes?

884
00:56:15,114 --> 00:56:17,449
He thought you were
looking for gold.

885
00:56:18,217 --> 00:56:21,120
Well, he'll just have to learn
to live with the truth.

886
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,797
Thank you.

887
00:56:33,532 --> 00:56:35,768
Tiberio feels he was deceived.

888
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,770
You should know this...

889
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:40,940
Tiberio has made a business
arrangement with your prisoner.

890
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,011
I'm aware of that.

891
00:56:46,145 --> 00:56:50,182
But due to circumstances,
that deal is null and void.

892
00:56:58,257 --> 00:56:59,859
(scoffs)

893
00:56:59,892 --> 00:57:03,195
That... idea will be
unacceptable.

894
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:07,767
5,000 dollars American
is owed to him.

895
00:57:08,734 --> 00:57:10,536
You know what?

896
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:13,506
Goddammit, Jack, you're right.

897
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:14,840
You're right.

898
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:17,109
Because I occasionally
keep one of these handy

899
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,912
when I gotta bullwhip me
some damn yokel.

900
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:23,182
(whip crack)

901
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,818
(whip crack)

902
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:28,254
First five years in the army,
they had me working Teamster.

903
00:57:28,287 --> 00:57:31,257
And I was cracking one of these
every day of the week.

904
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:32,224
(whip crack)

905
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:33,960
(horse neighing)

906
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:37,697
(tense music)

907
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,098
(whip crack)

908
00:57:39,131 --> 00:57:40,232
(grunts)

909
00:57:45,905 --> 00:57:47,840
(grunts)

910
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,582
(grunts)

911
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,898
(screams)

912
00:58:16,302 --> 00:58:17,570
(grunts)

913
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:18,871
(panting)

914
00:58:18,904 --> 00:58:20,840
Lucky son of a bitch.

915
00:58:26,112 --> 00:58:27,613
Señor Borlund...

916
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:30,816
My advice is for you
and your companion

917
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,918
to go immediately
from this place.

918
00:58:32,952 --> 00:58:35,054
Leave Trinidad Maria at once,

919
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:37,656
but leave Mrs. Kidd
and Elijah behind.

920
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,892
That's good advice. No.

921
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:45,131
You can explain to Señor Tiberio
that I am a man of the law.

922
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:48,801
And Elijah is a criminal.

923
00:58:48,834 --> 00:58:50,102
(sighing)

924
00:59:05,618 --> 00:59:07,586
(horse neighing)

925
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:09,622
(indistinct chatter)

926
00:59:09,655 --> 00:59:11,657
(water flowing)

927
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,599
You don't much like me,
do you, Mr. Poe?

928
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:23,736
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

929
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,172
And Mr. Borlund told me that
I need to watch over you, now.

930
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:28,207
It's because of Elijah,
isn't it?

931
00:59:29,642 --> 00:59:31,710
You hold the trouble
he's in against me.

932
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,246
I understand that.

933
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,582
But I take it,
despite everything...

934
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:39,318
...you still like Elijah.

935
00:59:41,253 --> 00:59:43,155
He's awful mad at me.

936
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:44,757
Thinks I let him down.

937
00:59:46,826 --> 00:59:48,861
I still count him as a friend.

938
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:55,835
And now, we have these events
that really irritate Tiberio.

939
00:59:55,868 --> 00:59:59,738
The situation with this Señora
Kidd is <i>muy complicada.</i>

940
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:02,274
This man makes things difficult
for Tiberio,

941
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:06,312
he has little authority over
the situation in Trinidad Maria.

942
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:09,615
This legal fellow got a name?

943
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:12,818
He's called Señor Max Borlund.

944
01:00:14,353 --> 01:00:16,856
Uh, say that again.

945
01:00:16,889 --> 01:00:18,757
Señor Max Borlund.

946
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,026
He's a private investigator.

947
01:00:22,928 --> 01:00:24,864
I know the man.

948
01:00:28,134 --> 01:00:30,669
You see this, Esteban?

949
01:00:30,703 --> 01:00:33,038
You put a gun in it,

950
01:00:33,072 --> 01:00:35,674
and it's the devil's right hand.

951
01:00:45,784 --> 01:00:47,920
(knocking on door)

952
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:50,956
I would like to see Elijah.

953
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,192
You have him in that cell there.

954
01:00:53,225 --> 01:00:54,860
Not possible, Señora.

955
01:00:54,894 --> 01:00:56,295
The prisoner will have
no visitors

956
01:00:56,328 --> 01:00:58,364
until his legal status
is determined.

957
01:00:58,397 --> 01:01:00,032
He's in my custody, but...

958
01:01:00,065 --> 01:01:02,835
under the jurisdiction
of Mr. Borlund.

959
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,370
Mr...

960
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:16,148
I'll need my key, please.

961
01:01:16,182 --> 01:01:19,084
- Did you have a pleasant walk?
- I did not.

962
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:21,420
My friend is in jail and they
refuse to let me see him.

963
01:01:21,453 --> 01:01:23,155
Entirely because of Mr. Borlund.

964
01:01:23,189 --> 01:01:24,890
Señora.

965
01:01:24,924 --> 01:01:27,927
This was left for you
by Mr. Borlund.

966
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,702
Elijah's gun and mine.

967
01:01:39,371 --> 01:01:42,174
Mr. Borlund is a man
of surprises.

968
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:53,085
(♪)

969
01:02:12,404 --> 01:02:14,206
Hola, Tiberio.

970
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:17,142
You were expecting me.

971
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:18,410
Yes, sir.

972
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:20,412
After my friendly talk
with Esteban,

973
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:23,749
I figured you might wanna
get to know Joe Cribbens.

974
01:02:24,584 --> 01:02:26,418
I hear all the news and gossip

975
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:30,055
since I've been staying in this
near-ghost town of yours.

976
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,526
I even hear you're up against
Max Borlund.

977
01:02:34,326 --> 01:02:36,462
He's a man with a reputation.

978
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,098
And I owe him.

979
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:40,833
You owe him?

980
01:02:40,866 --> 01:02:42,134
A favor?

981
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:44,937
No, <i>jefe.</i>

982
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,872
He's not my amigo.

983
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,174
<i>Oy, hombre.</i>

984
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:56,382
Why don't you tell me about
this... Max Borlund?

985
01:02:56,415 --> 01:02:59,351
Then, afterwards, maybe I have
somebody shoot you.

986
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:03,122
Have I offended you, <i>jefe?</i>

987
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:04,591
You killed the Englishman.

988
01:03:04,624 --> 01:03:07,926
He was doing a land contract
with me for many pesos.

989
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,362
- He accused me of cheating.
- Were you guilty?

990
01:03:10,396 --> 01:03:12,398
I didn't need to cheat him.

991
01:03:13,299 --> 01:03:15,134
I'm a good card player.

992
01:03:16,235 --> 01:03:18,003
So am I, <i>hombre.</i>

993
01:03:18,037 --> 01:03:19,506
So am I.

994
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:28,881
(tense music)

995
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:34,286
Three cards.

996
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:49,034
(sighing)

997
01:03:50,402 --> 01:03:53,038
I wanna see what you have, <i>jefe.</i>

998
01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:56,075
I have the winner.

999
01:03:58,243 --> 01:04:00,547
Ah... Sorry, <i>jefe.</i>

1000
01:04:05,984 --> 01:04:08,220
Most men are afraid
to beat me at cards.

1001
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:10,356
To take my money.

1002
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:14,393
If I lost on purpose,
I'd be insulting you.

1003
01:04:15,294 --> 01:04:18,631
This way, I prove I respect
the way you honor a game

1004
01:04:18,665 --> 01:04:21,166
of skill and good fortune.

1005
01:04:22,368 --> 01:04:23,570
<i>America no?</i>

1006
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:26,740
<i>America no,</i> from Texas.

1007
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:33,178
I decide not to kill you.

1008
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:35,114
I decide to use you.

1009
01:04:35,147 --> 01:04:37,182
<i>Oy, hombre,</i>
I don't like to lose money.

1010
01:04:37,216 --> 01:04:38,551
Another game.

1011
01:04:38,585 --> 01:04:40,185
But understand this:

1012
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:42,121
Now, you work for me.

1013
01:04:42,988 --> 01:04:44,524
You will follow orders.

1014
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:52,565
(♪)

1015
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:14,554
Old man, go find the gringo
bounty man.

1016
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:18,090
Tell him to prepare
to go to hell.

1017
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:20,259
Tell him I intend to kill him.

1018
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,331
(in Spanish):

1019
01:05:59,699 --> 01:06:02,167
(whimpering)

1020
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,175
(in English): Joe Cribbens.

1021
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:11,611
What, you know him?

1022
01:06:11,644 --> 01:06:13,412
He's a dangerous man.

1023
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:16,583
You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

1024
01:06:16,616 --> 01:06:19,318
He kill you, I kill him.

1025
01:06:29,662 --> 01:06:32,064
I hear you're breaking
your promise.

1026
01:06:32,097 --> 01:06:33,600
You're looking for me,
after all.

1027
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:36,335
Yeah. Time and circumstance.

1028
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:39,004
Besides, it's a long
time coming.

1029
01:06:40,072 --> 01:06:42,542
I got lots of personal feelings
against you, Mr. Borlund,

1030
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:44,777
but that's not why I'm here.

1031
01:06:44,811 --> 01:06:47,312
Right now, I'm just getting
paid to do a job.

1032
01:06:48,548 --> 01:06:52,351
But first, since this
is a special occasion,

1033
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,287
I guess I'd...

1034
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,322
kind of like to have me a drink.

1035
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:07,299
(in Spanish):

1036
01:07:11,738 --> 01:07:13,472
(in English): Time to settle up.

1037
01:07:13,506 --> 01:07:16,141
I like to pay off what I owe.

1038
01:07:16,174 --> 01:07:18,410
You low-rate me, Mr. Borlund.

1039
01:07:18,443 --> 01:07:20,145
Always have.

1040
01:07:20,178 --> 01:07:22,815
So, before I lay you low,

1041
01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:26,385
I'm gonna teach you
how to show me a little respect.

1042
01:07:27,754 --> 01:07:28,821
Have one.

1043
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:31,591
Skip the bullshit.

1044
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:34,561
But you can tell me
who's paying you.

1045
01:07:35,193 --> 01:07:37,162
Figure you already
know the answer.

1046
01:07:37,195 --> 01:07:39,464
Oh, Tiberio's got you
doing the dirty work.

1047
01:07:39,498 --> 01:07:41,568
Tiberio's got me doing
the hard work.

1048
01:07:41,601 --> 01:07:43,402
See it as a compliment.

1049
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:44,604
I was expecting you was trying

1050
01:07:44,637 --> 01:07:46,739
to come in on Mr. Borlund's
bounty money.

1051
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:49,542
I don't make my pesos that way.

1052
01:07:50,877 --> 01:07:53,546
I've done a few things
not on the square.

1053
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:56,315
But I never sink that low.

1054
01:08:01,854 --> 01:08:03,155
Well...

1055
01:08:04,256 --> 01:08:06,224
(gasps)

1056
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:08,226
(chairs creaking)

1057
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:10,495
If you're not gonna
drink with me...

1058
01:08:11,731 --> 01:08:13,365
I guess it's time...

1059
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:16,401
...to see how good
you really are.

1060
01:08:16,435 --> 01:08:18,136
Gonna have to take us both.

1061
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:21,541
- Your move, Joe.
- Gentlemen.

1062
01:08:25,243 --> 01:08:28,380
My name is Rachel Kidd,
if it's of any interest.

1063
01:08:28,413 --> 01:08:29,916
Don't be getting in this, ma'am.

1064
01:08:29,949 --> 01:08:33,886
He's right, Mrs. Kidd.
You best back away.

1065
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,221
Mr. Borlund and I
have our differences.

1066
01:08:36,254 --> 01:08:37,857
But he doesn't deserve
to be gunned down

1067
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:39,692
by a common criminal.

1068
01:08:39,726 --> 01:08:42,361
Oh, I'm not so common, ma'am.

1069
01:08:42,394 --> 01:08:45,732
And even though you seem to
have a real unpleasant nature,

1070
01:08:45,765 --> 01:08:48,701
I'd still hate to put
the finish on a woman.

1071
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:52,437
It ain't my style.
(gun clicking)

1072
01:08:52,471 --> 01:08:54,907
At this distance,
I don't think I'm going to miss.

1073
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:58,645
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

1074
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:00,713
I will not lose my nerve.

1075
01:09:00,747 --> 01:09:02,582
I will pull the trigger.

1076
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:04,449
I promise.

1077
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:10,790
(sighing)

1078
01:09:13,325 --> 01:09:15,260
(chuckling)
- You proud?

1079
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:18,765
Hiding behind a backup gun
and a woman.

1080
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:20,933
Tell you what, Joe.

1081
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:23,468
I think I'd ride on out
before she gets nervous

1082
01:09:23,502 --> 01:09:25,805
and accidentally
pulls the trigger.

1083
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:28,875
Okay, amigo.

1084
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:32,411
(♪)

1085
01:09:32,444 --> 01:09:34,847
I guess this hand goes to you.

1086
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:38,518
But... this ain't over yet.

1087
01:09:52,497 --> 01:09:55,367
Told you. Ain't got
nothing to worry about.

1088
01:09:56,769 --> 01:09:59,237
Once again, Mr. Poe,
very good.

1089
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:02,642
Once good, I aim to please.

1090
01:10:13,653 --> 01:10:17,355
Guess it was a good thing
you gave me back my gun.

1091
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:19,926
Joe was right.
This isn't over.

1092
01:10:19,959 --> 01:10:24,329
But I appreciate what you did,
even though it was very foolish.

1093
01:10:24,362 --> 01:10:27,567
You probably saved my life
back in the cabin.

1094
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,401
I owed you.

1095
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,870
I try to pay my debts.

1096
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:34,707
I don't really drink,
but I think I need this.

1097
01:10:36,876 --> 01:10:38,778
(knocking on door)

1098
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:48,688
Come to check
on the deserter man.

1099
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:51,524
How long you figure
before Rachel's husband arrives?

1100
01:10:52,424 --> 01:10:53,960
About another day or two.

1101
01:10:56,062 --> 01:10:58,030
He better be bringing his money.

1102
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:03,502
(crickets chirping)

1103
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,906
(♪)

1104
01:11:48,514 --> 01:11:49,916
Driver!

1105
01:11:49,949 --> 01:11:51,383
Why in the hell are we stopping?

1106
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,985
It's the middle of nowhere.

1107
01:11:54,486 --> 01:11:55,988
(gasps)
- Hello, ladies.

1108
01:11:56,022 --> 01:11:57,857
Martin Kidd, right?

1109
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:00,860
You step on out
and come with me.

1110
01:12:00,893 --> 01:12:02,628
<i>Por favor.</i>

1111
01:12:02,662 --> 01:12:05,430
Mr. Tiberio Vargas would like
to have a talk with you.

1112
01:12:10,169 --> 01:12:12,538
(♪)

1113
01:12:20,913 --> 01:12:23,448
(in Spanish):

1114
01:12:24,517 --> 01:12:28,888
(in English): I... speak English
a little bit.

1115
01:12:29,755 --> 01:12:31,691
But only when I want to.

1116
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,736

1117
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:22,174
<i>Vamos.</i>

1118
01:13:26,245 --> 01:13:29,181
- Mr. Kidd.
- Mr. Borlund!

1119
01:13:29,215 --> 01:13:32,118
You're my welcoming party.
It's good to see you.

1120
01:13:32,151 --> 01:13:33,819
How's my wife?

1121
01:13:33,853 --> 01:13:36,188
She's in the hotel
down the road.

1122
01:13:36,222 --> 01:13:39,759
Oh, that's where she is,
but how is she?

1123
01:13:39,792 --> 01:13:43,495
The past few weeks have been
very difficult for her.

1124
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,765
And Elijah Jones?

1125
01:13:45,798 --> 01:13:48,100
He's in a jail cell
around the corner.

1126
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:51,904
Good. I'll go visit Rachel
in due course,

1127
01:13:51,938 --> 01:13:55,041
I'm in no hurry to deal
with her salacious conduct.

1128
01:13:56,275 --> 01:13:59,178
Have you met this
Tiberio Vargas?

1129
01:13:59,211 --> 01:14:02,048
- Only once.
- He's quite a fellow.

1130
01:14:03,282 --> 01:14:06,585
Well, I owe you a debt
of gratitude

1131
01:14:06,619 --> 01:14:08,521
for rounding up
these two runaways.

1132
01:14:08,554 --> 01:14:09,889
You owe me money.

1133
01:14:09,922 --> 01:14:12,457
Oh, I do. And you'll be paid.

1134
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:14,492
Paid in full.

1135
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:16,929
(dog barking)

1136
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:23,903
(♪)

1137
01:14:37,249 --> 01:14:39,986
(indistinct chatter)

1138
01:14:58,838 --> 01:15:01,107
If I may join you,
I wish to discuss with you

1139
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,509
the situation we find
ourselves in.

1140
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:05,611
Then...

1141
01:15:05,644 --> 01:15:08,314
I guess we ought a
discuss Tiberio,

1142
01:15:08,347 --> 01:15:10,649
since nobody around here
can take a piss

1143
01:15:10,683 --> 01:15:12,184
without him saying so.

1144
01:15:12,218 --> 01:15:14,620
Tiberio is of course
disappointed.

1145
01:15:14,653 --> 01:15:16,856
He feels your tactics
were too bold.

1146
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:19,191
You were foolish and arrogant.

1147
01:15:20,693 --> 01:15:22,962
I am here to tell you that

1148
01:15:22,995 --> 01:15:26,032
Tiberio has no further need
of your services.

1149
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:30,302
You are dismissed.

1150
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:33,606
You're free to go.

1151
01:15:46,185 --> 01:15:48,621
(♪)

1152
01:15:51,257 --> 01:15:52,858
(sighing)

1153
01:15:59,732 --> 01:16:01,133
(sighing)

1154
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:04,103
(indistinct chatter)

1155
01:16:15,748 --> 01:16:17,083
(sighing)

1156
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:32,331
One thing about you and
your kind, Mr. Cockroach,

1157
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:34,300
can't get rid of you, can we?

1158
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:38,771
Yes, sir, you sons of bitches

1159
01:16:38,804 --> 01:16:42,041
must be first cousin
with Mr. Boll Weevil.

1160
01:16:43,109 --> 01:16:45,277
And that means nothing much
good to be said.

1161
01:16:46,145 --> 01:16:48,114
Just a goddamn nuisance.

1162
01:16:56,822 --> 01:16:57,756
(gunshots)

1163
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,191
(screaming)

1164
01:16:59,225 --> 01:17:00,893
(glass breaking)

1165
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:13,339
Mr. Borlund.

1166
01:17:13,973 --> 01:17:16,408
Have you seen your husband yet?

1167
01:17:18,144 --> 01:17:21,914
I think he made some kind
of a deal with Tiberio Vargas,

1168
01:17:21,947 --> 01:17:23,349
probably about you.

1169
01:17:23,382 --> 01:17:25,818
I just wanted to make sure
you're alright.

1170
01:17:28,387 --> 01:17:31,123
I saw his arrival on
the overland from the parlor.

1171
01:17:32,324 --> 01:17:35,227
It cost me a difficult moment.

1172
01:17:35,261 --> 01:17:37,997
But I'm fine, Mr. Borlund.
Thank you for your concern.

1173
01:17:41,167 --> 01:17:42,668
Just a moment.

1174
01:17:51,944 --> 01:17:54,246
My last will and testament.

1175
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,949
My lawyer's name is on
the front of the envelope.

1176
01:17:56,982 --> 01:17:59,718
To be delivered
in the event of my death.

1177
01:18:09,228 --> 01:18:11,864
(in Spanish):

1178
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:17,469
(grunts)

1179
01:18:17,503 --> 01:18:19,104
(in English): Yeah.

1180
01:18:19,138 --> 01:18:20,739
Must be getting me out of here.

1181
01:18:20,773 --> 01:18:22,741
(chuckling)
You know, I figured Tiberio

1182
01:18:22,775 --> 01:18:26,745
would see the light.
Me and him, we got business.

1183
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:34,720
Hello, Elijah.

1184
01:18:36,055 --> 01:18:37,456
Mr. Kidd.

1185
01:18:39,892 --> 01:18:41,427
Now, uh...

1186
01:18:44,396 --> 01:18:46,966
I can't say I expected you
to come down here.

1187
01:18:46,999 --> 01:18:49,401
No small talk, Elijah.

1188
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:51,136
It's time to pay you off.

1189
01:18:52,037 --> 01:18:54,006
(in Spanish):

1190
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:55,841
(in English): You gonna shoot
an unarmed man?

1191
01:18:55,874 --> 01:18:57,776
(scoffs)
- Yeah.

1192
01:18:57,810 --> 01:19:00,045
(gunshots)

1193
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:01,247
(body thudding)

1194
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,983
(in Spanish):

1195
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:06,819
(in English): Put a gun
in his hand.

1196
01:19:06,852 --> 01:19:08,887
You open that cell door.

1197
01:19:09,589 --> 01:19:11,290
He was trying to escape.

1198
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:23,068
(in Spanish):

1199
01:19:36,115 --> 01:19:37,182
(in English): He was dead

1200
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:39,018
when he fell to the floor
of his cell.

1201
01:19:41,387 --> 01:19:42,921
Poor Elijah.

1202
01:19:57,369 --> 01:20:00,005
Ah, Mr. Borlund. I expect
you've heard the news.

1203
01:20:00,039 --> 01:20:03,909
US Army Private Elijah Jones
is no longer a problem.

1204
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,212
How much did it cost
Mr. Kidd to commit this murder?

1205
01:20:07,246 --> 01:20:09,315
I'm investigating
these circumstances.

1206
01:20:09,348 --> 01:20:11,518
I am confused, Mr. Borlund.

1207
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:13,319
Who do you think
you're working for?

1208
01:20:13,352 --> 01:20:16,121
I work for myself.
Always have.

1209
01:20:16,889 --> 01:20:18,424
I was dishonored.

1210
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:20,859
A wife is not supposed
to run away from her husband

1211
01:20:20,893 --> 01:20:22,361
with a common soldier.

1212
01:20:22,394 --> 01:20:24,430
You mean common Black soldiers?

1213
01:20:25,497 --> 01:20:27,567
Yeah, that's exactly
what I mean.

1214
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,203
Common... Black... soldiers.

1215
01:20:32,204 --> 01:20:34,006
I tell you again,
I'm investigating...

1216
01:20:34,039 --> 01:20:35,508
(gunshot)

1217
01:20:35,542 --> 01:20:37,009
(horse neighing)

1218
01:20:37,042 --> 01:20:38,545
(gunshots)

1219
01:20:39,646 --> 01:20:41,413
(whooping)

1220
01:20:52,692 --> 01:20:54,993
(in Spanish):

1221
01:21:33,132 --> 01:21:35,467
(in English): I'd like to see
my wife, Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

1222
01:21:35,501 --> 01:21:37,903
Can you tell me her room number?

1223
01:21:39,071 --> 01:21:40,939
She's in number 4.

1224
01:21:40,973 --> 01:21:42,542
Up the stairs.

1225
01:21:48,615 --> 01:21:50,617
(knocking on door)

1226
01:22:06,331 --> 01:22:07,933
Martin.

1227
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:15,240
I am, uh... a bit slow
on coming to see you.

1228
01:22:15,274 --> 01:22:17,242
Of course, there's no point
in pretending

1229
01:22:17,276 --> 01:22:20,513
that there's any affection
between us, is there?

1230
01:22:20,547 --> 01:22:23,115
No. None at all.

1231
01:22:25,217 --> 01:22:26,619
I take it you owe Mr. Borlund

1232
01:22:26,653 --> 01:22:29,021
a great deal of money
for finding me.

1233
01:22:29,054 --> 01:22:31,223
Mr. Borlund will receive
what he's earned.

1234
01:22:31,256 --> 01:22:34,460
Just like Elijah?
Did he receive what he earned?

1235
01:22:34,493 --> 01:22:37,229
Uh, no. I was too good to him.
He died a quick death.

1236
01:22:37,262 --> 01:22:39,431
You are despicable, Martin.

1237
01:22:40,098 --> 01:22:41,366
(scoffs)

1238
01:22:42,468 --> 01:22:44,002
You're breaking marriage vows.

1239
01:22:44,036 --> 01:22:46,171
You run away with
an army deserter

1240
01:22:46,205 --> 01:22:49,576
who's also a criminal low-life
demanding ransom money

1241
01:22:49,609 --> 01:22:51,443
for your services to him
as a whore.

1242
01:22:51,477 --> 01:22:54,279
You come very close
to jeopardizing my future

1243
01:22:54,313 --> 01:22:56,381
political career
with this lurid scandal,

1244
01:22:56,415 --> 01:22:59,318
and then you tell me
that I'm despicable?

1245
01:22:59,351 --> 01:23:00,486
I was stupid.

1246
01:23:01,386 --> 01:23:03,088
I made bad situations worse

1247
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:04,724
which caused terrible
things to happen.

1248
01:23:04,757 --> 01:23:06,526
I have no excuse.

1249
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:08,060
You just wanted legitimacy

1250
01:23:08,093 --> 01:23:09,762
and the security
of my future inheritance.

1251
01:23:09,796 --> 01:23:11,163
(scoffs)
We never loved each other.

1252
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,632
- Hmm.
- It was all just

1253
01:23:12,665 --> 01:23:14,266
mutual convenience.

1254
01:23:14,299 --> 01:23:16,636
I intend to return to Santa Fe

1255
01:23:16,669 --> 01:23:19,438
where the story'll be put out
in the newspapers

1256
01:23:19,471 --> 01:23:22,174
how I killed my wife's abductor
in a heroic act,

1257
01:23:22,207 --> 01:23:24,309
but that she was unfortunately
captured and killed

1258
01:23:24,343 --> 01:23:26,478
by a gang of Mexican outlaws,

1259
01:23:26,513 --> 01:23:29,281
killed after, you know,
being used by them

1260
01:23:29,314 --> 01:23:31,584
in the lowest possible ways.

1261
01:23:31,618 --> 01:23:32,585
Good story.

1262
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:34,186
Sad thing is a lot of people

1263
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:35,387
will probably believe it.

1264
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,789
It's gonna be quite close
to the truth.

1265
01:23:36,823 --> 01:23:39,358
Given your appetite,
you might enjoy being fucked

1266
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:43,696
up, down and sideways by those
<i>vaqueros</i> before they kill you.

1267
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:45,330
They will of course kill you.

1268
01:23:45,364 --> 01:23:49,669
No, it's part of my
understanding with Señor Vargas.

1269
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:53,338
- You think I'll go willingly?
- Oh no.

1270
01:23:54,172 --> 01:23:57,677
But these men are quite
happy to use force.

1271
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,812
And you have nowhere to hide.

1272
01:24:01,848 --> 01:24:06,251
I'll leave you now
to think about your future.

1273
01:24:08,487 --> 01:24:11,156
I don't think it's going
to work out the way you want.

1274
01:24:13,793 --> 01:24:15,762
You won't do it.

1275
01:24:15,795 --> 01:24:18,430
You don't actually
have the nerve to kill a man.

I've changed.

1277

1284
01:24:55,334 --> 01:24:57,302
I've killed my husband.

1285
01:25:00,272 --> 01:25:02,575
Well, you gave him
what he deserved.

1286
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:04,476
He killed Elijah.

1287
01:25:05,912 --> 01:25:07,379
Yes.

1288

Mrs. Kidd?

And I imagine you have

with Elijah Jones?

That was my mistake.

1314
01:28:57,677 --> 01:29:00,613
I should have realized Mr. Kidd
intended to kill Elijah.

1315
01:29:01,714 --> 01:29:03,381
He bribed my deputy.

I did you a favor, bounty man.

I've been shot,

don't cut my arm off.

Your husband's dead.

It's gonna take a few stitches.

1410
