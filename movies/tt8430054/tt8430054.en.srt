2
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,079
What does the word 'home' mean to you?

3
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,399
Home?

4
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,039
It's someplace safe.

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,679
Somewhere...

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,399
...you know you can stay, and
you don't have to move on.

7
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,519
It's not someplace temporary.

8
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,079
Scoot up a bit, just a little.

9
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,159
A bit down again.
Like that. Perfect.

10
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,999
I also have to do this.

11
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,879
So if you close your eyes...
- Yes.

12
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,919
...and try to take a deep breath.
Just relax completely.

13
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,919
Have you ever told your story before?

14
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,359
No.

15
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,199
But you're okay with telling me?

16
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,359
Yes.

17
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,799
Then I think that...

18
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,519
You don't have to tell me yet.
Just think back to your earliest memory.

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,919
What's the earliest thing
you remember?

20
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,959
I'm three or four years old.

21
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,399
Hey! Watch out!

22
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,719
Where are you?
- We're in Afghanistan, in Kabul.

23
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,079
Can you describe yourself?

24
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,319
I think I always had a tendency...

25
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,039
I think I always had a tendency...

26
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,599
I think I always had a tendency...

27
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,919
to be a little different.
Let's just put it like that.

28
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,319
to be a little different.
Let's just put it like t-hat.

29
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,839
to be a little different.
Let's just put it like that.

30
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,039
I wasn't afraid of wearing
my sister's dresses...

31
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,879
...my youngest sister's nightgown.

32
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,319
I liked the attention.

33
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,519
Where are you in Kabul?

34
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,839
In the house where I was born.

35
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,799
Where are your parents?
- My mom is inside.

36
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,479
I just know she is.

37
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,919
There you go, sweetie.
That should do the trick.

38
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,719
At night, I put my head on her lap,
and she strokes my hair.

39
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,199
No one can do it like her.

40
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,479
When I look at my mother, I wish I could
see what she looked like when she was young.

41
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,319
I've seen photos of her
with dark black hair,

42
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,639
but I only remember her with grey.

43
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,279
Go back and play.
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

44
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,399
Dad took me by the hand,
and we walked the airstrip together.

45
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,279
He lifted me up and
put me in the cockpit.

46
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,559
It didn't have a steering wheel. It was
like a joystick, with buttons everywhere.

47
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,639
My sister is telling us
stories about my father.

48
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,119
...and then we took off!
He said:

49
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,319
"It's important that you don't
touch any buttons."

50
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,039
"If you hit the wrong one,
it'll go kaboom!"

51
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,479
Then we flew off, into the clouds...

52
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,079
...and we could see
to the end of the world!

53
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,679
It was amazing!

54
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,279
Lots of it is true,
but she makes a lot up too.

55
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,639
My brother and I are completely in awe
of what she is telling us.

56
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,559
He said that as long as he was there,
nothing would ever happen to me.

57
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,519
I remember feeling jealous.

58
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,079
Why were you jealous?

59
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,399
Because she is telling us about
all these great things

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,919
that my brother and I never
got to experience...

61
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,799
...being together with our father.

62
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,879
Where is your father?

63
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,839
Can we just talk before we start?
- Yes, of course.

64
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,479
Some things are hard to talk
about. It's still tough,

65
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,079
but I need to come to terms with them.

66
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,439
It's my past, I can't run away
from it, and I don't want to.

67
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,679
I might be ready in
half a year, a year.

68
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,839
Of course.
We'll take it at your pace.

69
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,039
I'm just glad that you are
finally ready to tell your story.

70
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,159
I remember back in high school,
I had no clue.

71
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,719
There were so many stories
going around, like:

72
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,239
"Did you hear he walked
all the way from Afghanistan?"

73
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,959
Good one!
- I didn't know what to believe.

74
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
There were stories like that.

75
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,359
Wow!

76
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,959
I remember the first time I saw you.

77
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,039
There weren't a lot of immigrants back then.

78
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,399
You were wearing a black and white
checkered shirt. Remember?

79
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,279
Yes, I do.

80
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,719
And Buffalo shoes.
- That's me.

81
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,039
I thought, "He's cool."
- Fearless.

82
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,959
You kept staring straight ahead, like
you were trying not to attract attention.

83
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,719
You kept staring straight ahead, like
you were trying not to attract attention.

84
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,399
I don't think you noticed me. I was
surprised we got off at the same stop.

85
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:17,999
Look, I think it's from our Junior year?
- Yes, it's Junior prom.

86
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,639
Check out those fancy shoes!
Everything was tip top.

87
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,519
Here it is.

88
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,599
This is where my story begins.

89
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,239
I wrote it all down,
when I got to Denmark.

90
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,959
Can you try to read it?

91
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,999
It'll be hard. I'm not that good
at reading Dari anymore.

92
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,439
I can't even read my own handwriting.

93
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,199
After the Mujahideen...

94
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,479
The Mujahideen seized power
in Afghanistan...

95
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,479
They killed my father, kidnapped
my sister, and killed my mother and brother.

96
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:36,479
If I had stayed, they would likely
have killed me too.

97
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,679
It was pretty intense.

98
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,159
Have you told Kasper
any of these stories?

99
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,359
No.

100
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,239
Kasper, I'm going to start filming.

101
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,639
See if it needs more salt.

102
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,479
When are you getting married?

103
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,199
When we find a place to live.

104
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,559
First of all,
I want you to come home.

105
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,959
Secondly, I want a place
where we can have a party.

106
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,999
If we need to wait till we can have
a party, it'll take a while.

107
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,439
Maybe I'll just go buy us
a house while you're away.

108
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,479
You'll just have to
deal with it then.

109
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,039
When do you leave tomorrow?
- I have to be at the airport at 10.

110
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,839
How long this time?
- Till June.

111
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,759
I'll be back for a few months
and then leave again.

112
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,879
You leave again?
- I think so.

113
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,239
Kasper has no idea.

114
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,799
Where are you going?
- Back to the US.

115
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,719
Did you get an email from
your professor at Princeton?

116
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,959
No, a letter. He wants me
to do a post-doc.

117
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,479
To continue your research?
- Yes.

118
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,879
What does Kasper say about that?

119
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,759
We haven't really talked about it.

120
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,399
Last time we spoke,
we talked about your father.

121
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,599
Are you up to talking more about that?

122
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,399
Yes, it's just sad.

123
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,279
If we're back in Kabul
during your childhood,

124
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,679
where is your father?

125
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,479
We don't know.

126
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,039
He was taken away.
- Why?

127
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,799
Arise, you victims of oppression!

128
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,959
Arise, you prisoners of want!

129
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,519
Because the Afghan government
saw him as a threat

130
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,239
to communist rule,

131
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,919
after they overthrew
the monarchy in the late '70s...

132
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,519
...in 1979.

133
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,999
They rounded up about 3,000 people,
including my father.

134
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,719
My mother told me about the day
he was picked up.

135
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,839
She said that he expected it.

136
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,559
Akhtar Nawabi?
- Yes?

137
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,239
We have orders to bring you in.

138
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,799
Wait here. I'll get my coat.

139
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,039
Okay, but hurry up!

140
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,559
They've come for me.

141
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,959
You should keep this...

142
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,359
...just in case.

143
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,799
I'm not a threat to anyone.
I'll be back soon.

144
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,719
Then he was put in jail.

145
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,679
My mom told me that the family
was able to visit him quite often,

146
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,039
but three months later, he disappeared...

147
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,319
...just like that.

148
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,799
Amin, listen. You need to keep it high
and make sure the string is taut.

149
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,319
I spend a lot of time with my brother.

150
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,079
He's a real boy, the kind who gets his
hands dirty. He breeds pigeons on our roof.

151
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,919
Hold it tight! Be careful, Amin!
Give it to me! Give it to me!

152
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,599
Sorry.

153
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,119
I have 69 cards. How many do you have?
- 52.

154
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,279
I have 69 cards. How many do you have?
- 52.

155
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,759
How about I trade you Vivek Mushran
for Anil Kapoor?.

156
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,879
- Please, Sabia.

157
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,639
I said no. I'm not interested.
- But you have two Anil Kapoors!

158
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,039
I'll give you Vivek Mushran
and Mamik-Singfi for him.

159
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,319
I don't need either of them, and
it's always nice to have a spare Anil.

160
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,919
Look at him! He's so handsome.

161
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,439
Ugh! You really piss me off!

162
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,519
How do you want it?
- I don't care.

163
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,359
Actually, I'm not in the mood for this.

164
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,199
When did you first realize
that you were gay?

165
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,119
I wasn't very old.

166
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,359
I think I've had fantasies about men
ever since I was five or six years old.

167
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,999
I remember one of them very clearly.

168
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,199
I was enamored with
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

169
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,639
Seriously. I fantasized about him.

170
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,399
I also liked Jean-Claude Van Damme,
but for different reasons.

171
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,919
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the way
I "liked" him was ... different.

172
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,279
I kind of knew all along
that I was into men,

173
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,959
without actually knowing what it meant.

174
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:00,039
In Afghanistan, homosexuals didn't
exist. There wasn't even a word for them.

175
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,999
They brought shame on the family,

176
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,919
so it was hard to accept being gay.

177
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,519
We play volleyball everyday.

178
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,999
Come on!

179
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,359
My brother and I
we're quite the team.

180
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,119
My brother is very tall
and great at spiking.

181
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,599
Focus!

182
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,839
These days, terrorists are receiving

183
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,919
brand-new, long-range missiles
from the US government.

184
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,479
The US wants a Vietnam War for the USSR
in Afghanistan, but I'm telling you

185
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:14,119
that when the US supplies
the terrorists with aid

186
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,239
to destroy Afghanistan,

187
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,719
Afghanistan could well become
a second Vietnam for the US instead!

188
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,359
The civil war began when my father was
taken away. They fought the Mujahideen.

189
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,759
The war isn't fought
in Kabul proper,

190
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,199
so we don't notice it too much.

191
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,999
The only reason I notice it
is because of my brother.

192
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,479
He's a growing teenage boy.

193
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,999
He doesn't want to join the army,
but he has to.

194
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,159
Saif!

195
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,639
The police are coming!
- Stop!

196
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,559
Run!

197
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,079
Saif!

198
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,039
Saif!

199
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,279
Saif!

200
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,679
Mom!

201
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,559
Mom, they're here.
They caught him!

202
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,479
You can't stay here. You need to hide.
Run over to Uncle Mahdi! Go!

203
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,839
Come back when it's dark.
Be careful!

204
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,319
My brother is always on the run.
He isn't the only one either.

205
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,079
Thousands of Afghan boys
don't want to go to war,

206
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,799
and with good reason.
Most of them don't return.

207
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,799
They die.

208
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,359
Oh my country, you suffer,
because you were betrayed.

209
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,839
Oh my country,
you've lost your melody, your voice.

210
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,119
Oh my country,
you are in pain, and there is no cure.

211
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,319
Oh my country...

212
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,999
Mujahideen attacks are on the rise
in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal.

213
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,079
Yesterday, seven people were killed
near Kabul Airport.

214
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,959
...The last of the American embassy
personnel flew out of Kabul today

215
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,599
and went to India. Most other Western
embassies are either closed or closing.

216
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,879
The conventional wisdom is that when
the Soviets have completely withdrawn...

217
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,359
the Afghans will set on one another,

218
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,599
and the capital will be even more
dangerous than it is now.

219
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,799
The Soviet transport circles downward,
firing magnesium flares

220
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,679
to divert any heat-seeking missiles.

221
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,679
The American-armed Mujahideen guerrillas
are in the mountains around the city.

222
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,399
We know the Afghan army isn't
strong enough to fend off the Taliban,

223
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,599
so it's just a matter of time
before they invade Kabul.

224
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:47,239
We know they will seek revenge against
people they consider "non-believers."

225
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,799
Amin!

226
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,199
We need to get out right away.

227
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,079
We need to get out right away.

228
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,159
We pack a few things, but
we don't have time to sell anything.

229
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,479
Amin, come on.

230
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,039
So you barely made it out?
- Yes, at the very last minute.

231
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,759
I cry all the way to the airport
and then, on the plane.

232
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,599
Yeah...

233
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,959
We fled to Moscow.

234
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,039
Russia was the only country
that would grant us a tourist visa.

235
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,239
Russia was such a strange place
to be at the time.

236
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,959
We arrive a year
after the fall of communism.

237
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,399
People are starving,
and the supermarkets are empty.

238
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:55,479
The ruble keeps devaluating,
and they keep printing new notes.

239
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,199
There's a lot of crime,
and you can't trust the police.

240
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,679
Finally!
- Abbas! My son!

241
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,919
My big brother, who lives in Sweden,
meet us in Moscow when we arrive.

242
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,919
He rented an apartment for us.

243
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,679
Oh, my God! You've grown!

244
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,199
He fled in the '80s,
because he didn't want to go to war.

245
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,879
Go back!

246
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,959
Wow!

247
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,319
We need to get them to Sweden
as quickly as possible,

248
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,559
so that they can start school.
If we wait, they'll be too old.

249
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,039
I know. What about you, sweetheart?
Is Sweden treating you well?

250
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,279
Cleaning doesn't pay well,
but it's all right.

251
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,159
$4,600 dollars is all I could put together.
I'll get you more when I can.

252
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,559
Thank you.

253
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,279
When do you have to go back?
- Tomorrow. I only have two days off.

254
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,639
Come here, you two!

255
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,999
I bet it's boring hanging out with
mom and our sisters all the time.

256
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,719
I'll make real men out of you,
when you get to Sweden.

257
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,399
Just you wait!
The girls in Sweden are beautiful!

258
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,199
What's the plan?
- Getting out of Russia.

259
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,279
It costs a lot of money
to get smuggled to Sweden.

260
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,839
By traffickers?

261
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,199
Yes, human traffickers.
It's the cheapest way.

262
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,199
You can get to Sweden for $3,000.

263
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,399
It's $15-20,000 for all of us.

264
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,039
My big brother is under
enormous pressure because of it.

265
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,039
He doesn't make a lot of money.

266
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,879
Stop! Papers, please!

267
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,639
Papers!

268
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,639
Stay there.

269
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,159
Your visa is expired.

270
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,519
Thank you.

271
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,599
Go on.

272
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,999
Beat it!

273
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,839
We couldn't move about the city freely,

274
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,679
because we didn't have
the right papers,

275
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,479
so we stayed in Russia illegally.

276
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,839
I ran away from the police
whenever I saw them on the street.

277
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,239
So, I'd sit at home all day,
watching Mexican soap operas.

278
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,359
The whole family did.
It was the highlight of our day.

279
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,759
Let me help you with that suitcase.
- Oh, thank you!

280
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:11,039
Is this your first time in Mexico City?
- Yes! I've never seen anything like it.

281
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,399
And so we sit there for a year.

282
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,999
We just sit there, waiting to leave.

283
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,639
It's really hard for my brother
to put together all that money.

284
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,159
Then, there is only enough
to send my sisters.

285
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,439
Call me as soon as you get there.

286
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,959
Of course.

287
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,719
We're not told much about the journey.

288
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,239
Often, the traffickers
don't know themselves.

289
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:02,759
Then we just wait for
the call from Sweden,

290
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,839
hoping it's them,
saying they're safe.

291
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,639
Those traffickers are such bastards!

292
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,799
I think they're a bunch of psychopaths.

293
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,439
Get in!

294
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,239
You two! Get in!

295
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,959
They are put inside a freight
container, with lots of other people.

296
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,919
It's a bit warm in here...

297
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,639
Then it's loaded
onto a huge cargo ship,

298
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,919
and surrounded by other containers,

299
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,719
blocking it, so they can't get out.

300
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,279
My older brother called.

301
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,279
It was... I mean, it was...

302
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,879
Everything seemed normal

303
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,039
as the MS Estonia arrived in Stockholm
from Tallinn this morning.

304
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,679
The 1,100 passengers were unaware
of the drama happening below deck.

305
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:19,959
This is incredibly inhumane.
It's human trafficking at its worst.

306
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,519
Confined in a trailer were
64 refugees, fighting to get out.

307
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,839
It's unclear how long
they'd been inside.

308
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,639
Of the 64, 26 were children,
the youngest just 8 months old.

309
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:52,159
They nearly died on the way.

310
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,679
They're not well.

311
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,199
I think it's mainly the shock,
but they aren't saying much.

312
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,599
I know someone,
who can take a look at them.

313
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,479
I just need to get one thing straight:
Your two sisters survived, right?

314
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,199
Yes.
- They're not dead?

315
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,079
And you have an older brother,
and they all live in Sweden.

316
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,839
Yeah.

317
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,559
Because...I thought
your whole family was dead.

318
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,519
Yeah.
- And they're not.

319
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,479
No.

320
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,839
That's fantastic!
It's really great to hear that.

321
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,319
But in all these years, you never
told anyone about your family?

322
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,039
I think it was only
after I started university

323
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,199
that I began
to open up a bit...

324
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,159
...to an ex-boyfriend.
But that didn't go so well.

325
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,639
I told him a little about my family.

326
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,279
At first he seemed...

327
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,119
...very understanding,

328
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,519
but when we had a big argument,
he used it against me.

329
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,799
He said he would call the police
and inform them

330
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:36,119
that my asylum was based on a lie.

331
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:44,439
Even after I broke up with him,
I was terrified of it for years.

332
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,599
I think it's a great house.

333
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,879
It's nice.

334
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,039
The property is pretty big.
- It's enormous!

335
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,679
Is that also part of the property?
- Yes, all the way to the road.

336
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,239
It has a lot of potential.
- There's a cat!

337
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,439
It walks around like it owns the place.

338
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,119
If we bring our cat,
they'll have a big fight.

339
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,679
Try calling it.
- What do you say in Danish?

340
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,279
Here, kitty, kitty! Come here.

341
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,799
It wants to.
It's flirting.

342
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,359
Honey, look at all those
hazelnut trees!

343
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,439
I think they're hazelnut.
- Come.

344
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,519
Are they hazelnut?
- Yes.

345
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,359
He's so cute.

346
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,359
They're hazelnut, right?
- Kitty...

347
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,999
I'm not sure. They're not
hazelnut. They just look like it.

348
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,279
You really get into the summer mood
with the heat and...

349
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,799
But can you see yourself living there?
- Yes, I can. - Really?

350
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,799
What do you think?

351
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,119
Would you be able to live there, babe?
I don't want to be out there by myself.

352
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,199
Yes, of course.
- So you won't...

353
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,159
suddenly have all sorts
of commitments all the time.

354
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,199
The narrow roads
and big fields...

355
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,319
...They remind me of my time
at the asylum center.

356
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,719
I'm scared of feeling depressed
out there.

357
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,639

358
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,159
You'll never be a part of this family.
Leave! I never want to see you again!

359
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,559
But I'm carrying our child!
You can't just throw me out!

360
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,079
Police!

361
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,839
Police!

362
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:42,079
We heard a noise. Open the door!
We just want to talk to you.

363
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,039
We need to see your papers!
Open the door.

364
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,839
Fuck! I hate them.
They're the worst people in the world.

365
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,519
They stank of vodka.
It was so disgusting.

366
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,519
We know you're in there! Open up!

367
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,239
The nastiest people imaginable!

368
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,919
Even worse than the traffickers!

369
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,599
We have all day.

370
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,879
I don't remember the day we fled,
or how we got from Russia to...

371
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,799
I don't remember.

372
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,279
We drove for hours.

373
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,319
Now I remember.
We are in a big truck,

374
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,079
which normally carried wood.
They drive us.

375
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,799
We're dropped off in a forest
and have to sit there and wait.

376
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,199
It's really cold, and we
aren't dressed warmly enough.

377
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,919
There are two things I'll never
forget about that night.

378
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,399
Come on, Mother,
We need to keep up.

379
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,119
Faster!
No talking.

380
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,519
Wait!

381
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,279
Stop.

382
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,439
You there!
Keep moving. Go on!

383
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,839
He needs other shoes.
- We don't have any.

384
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,399
Are you kidding? You know we're
sneaking across the border, don't you?

385
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,879
What do you want me to do?
- Take them off!

386
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,559
He can't just take his shoes off!
- If you don't do it, I will!

387
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,359
What's going on? You can't stop.
You have to keep walking. Move!

388
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,119
No! Stop! I'll carry him.

389
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,839
I'll carry him.

390
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,759
We won't wait for you. Go!

391
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,319
You have to stay there, sweetie.
He's helping us...

392
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,279
Thank you.

393
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,039
Wait! Come help us!

394
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,519
She's holding us up.
- Why not shoot her in the head?

395
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:54,119
"We'll shoot her in the head
and leave her here." So cold-blooded.

396
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,839
I'll do it. It's easy.

397
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,959
No, I'll make sure she keeps up.
We'll hurry.

398
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,639
I think he said that to her son.

399
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,919
My mother was also old.

400
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,919
That woman... It's good
she didn't understand Russian.

401
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,159
They got this boat to take us to Sweden.

402
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,759
across the Baltic Sea to Sweden.

403
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,679
I know the boat can't...

404
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,599
My mother is terrified of water.

405
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,519
Are we all getting on this boat?
- I guess.

406
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,279
But there's not enough room?
- There has to be.

407
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,599
We'll never convince Mom
to get in that.

408
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,799
She has to. She can't stay here.

409
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:35,279
You need to stay below deck, so
the coast guard won't see you.

410
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,119
We stripped the inside,
so there's room down there.

411
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,079
It will take two days to get to Sweden.
Let's go!

412
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,559
No... No!

413
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,039
We sail for a couple of hours...
I think.

414
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,959
People start puking.

415
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,079
It's bad, real bad.

416
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,119
Water! Water is getting in!
Help! Help!

417
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,279
Open up!

418
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,079
So you're bailing out water
in the pouring rain.

419
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,079
We need to keep bailing it out,
because it keeps getting in.

420
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,999
The boat doesn't even have
a radio,

421
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,799
so we can't call for help.

422
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,599
No one knows how to swim either.

423
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,599
I think it would have been easier
if it was just me.

424
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,919
My mother was terrified.

425
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:24,239
Whenever she talked about death,
she always mentioned water.

426
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,399
Dying in water, drowning,
was her worst nightmare.

427
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,159
What's going through your head?

428
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,719
Who do I save first,
if the boat goes down?

429
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,239
Because you knew how to swim?

430
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,999
No.

431
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,839
I didn't really think about that.

432
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:14,959
Maybe I thought I could.
I have no clue.

433
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,159
I was more concerned...

434
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,799
...about who I would choose.

435
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,839
A few days pass.

436
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,719
Help! Over here!

437
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,879
Over here! Help!

438
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,559
It's from Norway!

439
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,359
I don't know why, but as I stand
there, looking at that ship,

440
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,439
I just can't feel the joy.

441
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,959
What's wrong?

442
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,239
I'm embarrassed...

443
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:16,519
...embarrassed and ashamed
of our situation.

444
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,639
People want to jump into the water
and swim to the ship.

445
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,559
I mean...

446
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,039
They think that if they jump
into the water and swim,

447
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,399
the ship will pick them up.

448
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,679
Everyone is so desperate...

449
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,959
It's a fantastic opportunity!

450
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,319
All of a sudden...

451
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:03,039
everything we want to achieve
is right there.

452
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:07,519
You could almost reach out and touch it.

453
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,079
We have called the Estonian
border police. They're on their way.

454
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,039
They will take you back.

455
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,079
We have called the Estonian
border police. They're on their way.

456
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,119
They will take you back.

457
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,879
Then the police come and take us:

458
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:07,679
men in camouflage, with
balaclavas and face paint.

459
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:13,159
They scream and shout like crazy.

460
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,439
I have no idea what's going on.

461
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,399
I'm crying and crying.
I can't stop.

462
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,439
I can see the fear in the
adults' eyes. They are terrified!

463
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,639
Even the big men... You can see it
in their eyes. They're petrified.

464
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,039
It really scared me.

465
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,679
If they are that afraid,
what will happen to us?

466
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,919
It must be serious.

467
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,239
It must be serious.

468
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,199
We are locked inside
an abandoned building.

469
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,399
There are guards,
and on that same day,

470
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,719
they run barbed wire
around the building.

471
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,359
People were in shock.

472
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,119
Based on how they treated us,

473
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,959
we thought we would
be there for the rest of our lives.

474
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,439
We have no idea what will happen to us.
No one tells us anything.

475
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,879
Journalists come and film us.
We hope something will happen, but no.

476
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,439
They get their footage of poor refugees
and go home to do their TV shows...

477
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:40,879
But nothing actually happens.
It's just us and the guards.

478
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,279
It felt like my life had ground to a halt.

479
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,439
Then, six months later,

480
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,839
they gave us two options:

481
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,519
Stay here to rot, or...

482
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,959
...go back to Moscow.

483
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,679
As soon as we arrive in Russia,
we are arrested by the Russian police.

484
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,159
They want to send us back
to Afghanistan,

485
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,159
but luckily... the Russian police
were so corrupt

486
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,279
that if we gave them the last
of our money, they would let us go.

487
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,759
Thanks for letting me crash here.

488
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,679
Do you want a snack with that?
- No.

489
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,079
What happened?

490
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,639
I just needed to get away.

491
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,559
I told Kasper that
I'm doing my postdoc at Princeton.

492
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,359
It didn't go well?
- No, it didn't.

493
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,119
He feels stupid because
we looked at al those houses.

494
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,919
He doesn't understand.

495
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:35,079
It seems as if
it's more Kasper's project than yours?

496
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,879
I don't know. It's his dream, but
I'd also like a place to settle down.

497
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,799
But?
- Nothing.

498
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,639
It makes me a little nervous.

499
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,439
Because...

500
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,279
Getting out of Russia
was a tremendous gift...

501
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,799
a tremendous gift.
I got a life.

502
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:10,479
I couldn't just
give that up or...

503
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,199
Yeah.

504
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:17,679
If it wasn't for my siblings,
I wouldn't be where I am today.

505
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:25,199
So, I bear a tremendous burden
on my shoulders...

506
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,679
...you could say.

507
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,159
For example, my brother had
a Finnish girlfriend for ten years.

508
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,759
They wanted children,
but he couldn't,

509
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,799
because he had to save
every penny to get us out of Russia.

510
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,839
His girlfriend left him.

511
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,559
How does not moving to the countryside
help your family?

512
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,439
Aren't you supposed to be on my side?

513
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,839
When are you leaving for the US?
- On Sunday.

514
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,919
Sunday?
- Yes.

515
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:19,279
How long will you be gone?
- I'm coming home for a few days.

516
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,039
So, three or four months from now?
- Yes.

517
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,799
Look at this place.
I can't believe it's ours!

518
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,239
Only the best for you, my love.

519
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:51,399
Something happened to my mom.
She started acting strange in Russia.

520
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,279
She got some kind of allergy.

521
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,519
I think she's homesick.
She misses Afghanistan.

522
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,559
It's boring just staying home

523
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:23,439
I'm a teenager, and I want
to experience something different,

524
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,079
so I go outside.

525
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:35,599
This is a restaurant of
Moscow-McDonald's joint venture.

526
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,839
This company is known around
the world for its prompt food service.

527
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,199
When we get out of Russia, we should
go to McDonald's to celebrate.

528
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,479
I'd like a Big Mac and a Coke,
thank you! It's going to be so nice.

529
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,799
Hey, you! Come with me!
- No! We didn't do anything!

530
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,199
Let me see your papers then.

531
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,799
Just as I thought.

532
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,879
Stop! Don't...
- Where's your money?

533
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,919
We don't have any!
We just wanted to see what's going on.

534
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,519
Can I see that watch for a second?
- Don't touch him!

535
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,079
Come here!

536
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,159
Look what I found.
- Nice! I'd like to have some fun with her.

537
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,919
Go on. Sit down!

538
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:46,999
What's with them?
- They need to be taught a lesson.

539
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,919
Sir!

540
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,559
Why are they here?
- These two? They're greedy. They won't pay.

541
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,359
What about her?
- She doesn't have any money either,

542
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,839
we thought she could pay us
in another way.

543
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,559
You two! Out!

544
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,639
I remember her face...
her black hair...

545
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,319
...big, dark eyes...

546
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,839
Fuck! Why didn't I protect her?
Say something? I just let it happen.

547
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:44,119
It's one of the most horrible
feelings I ever had.

548
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,839
I can't do this anymore.

549
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,719
My brother isn't very old,

550
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,079
but he assumed responsibility for us.

551
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,159
He wants to send my mother and I first.

552
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,599
This time, we're very careful.

553
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:28,479
We make arrangements with a
very expensive trafficker,

554
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,079
because we didn't want to go
through the same things again.

555
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,919
We insist on a safe, secure route,

556
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,519
which mean we only have enough
for one of us to leave.

557
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:48,199
In the end, my brother decides
that it should be me.

558
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:54,119
It was horrible, because I felt awful
about leaving him behind.

559
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:58,159
Each week, each month,
each year,

560
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:02,159
his chance of having a
decent future dwindles.

561
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,559
Okay. You have to learn
your name and date of birth by heart. V

562
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:38,399
You're Russian. Remember that. Speak
Russian if anyone asks you anything.

563
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:44,439
Destroy the passport as soon as
you reach your final destination.

564
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:50,319
If the police catch you with a fake
passport, they'll send you back to Russia.

565
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:53,759
Stick to the story we gave you. It's crucial.

566
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,559
From now on, you have no family.
They're dead.

567
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,759
You fled Afghanistan on your own,
without any help.

568
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,439
If you say anything else,
you'll be shipped back to Afghanistan.

569
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,959
What do you mean?
- Don't tell anyone about your family.

570
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,679
You have no family. Understand?

571
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,399
Good. Now get some sleep.
We have a long day tomorrow.

572
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,559
The traffickers had all this power
over my life.

573
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,279
You're left completely powerless.

574
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,919
I'm with another young guy,
also alone, just like like me.

575
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:10,799
He's nice and funny.
He makes me laugh.

576
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:16,599
He's a bit boyish, but there is
an age difference between us.

577
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,359
He's closer to becoming a man.

578
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,839
I think it's kind of sexy.

579
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,119
I think I have a little crush on him.

580
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,439
His gold necklace is so beautiful...

581
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:37,159
Do you want to try it on?
I'm sure it will look great on you.

582
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,039
Very nice!

583
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:09,879
Our flight to Istanbul will take
around two hours.

584
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,319
Thank you for flying
Ukrainian International Airlines.

585
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,359
Once you pass by
passport control on your right...

586
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,559
Don't stare! Once you pass it,
you're on your own.

587
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:50,399
You're going to different destinations.
You're going to Zurich, Gate D27.

588
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:52,759
You're going to Copenhagen, Gate A9.

589
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:58,639
You're going to Copenhagen, Gate A9.

590
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,879
I thought I was going to Sweden?
- No, you're going to Denmark.

591
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,559
Denmark? But...

592
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:10,759
It's the last trip, so you'll have
to manage on your own from now on.

593
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,719
Remember to eall home
as soon as you land. It's very important.

594
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,479
That way, I can get my money.

595
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,359
Okay. Now, go!

596
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,519
You're going to Zurich?
- Yes, it's in Switzerland.

597
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,119
Do you have family there?
- Is yours in Copenhagen?

598
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,759
Hey, thanks for letting me borrow it.
- No, keep it.

599
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:50,719
Are you sure?

600
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,479
Thank you.

601
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,559
Good luck.
- You too.

602
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,919
It's weird that I can't remember
his name, when he meant so much to me.

603
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:13,039
He was part of something
that had a huge influence on my life.

604
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:19,879
Then, all of a sudden, I'm flying
on my own, and landing in Copenhagen.

605
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:36,519
I sit there waiting for a while.

606
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:45,119
I see this big group of people,
so I start to follow them.

607
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,239
Move!

608
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,199
I think I just said "refugee."

609
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,879
What? Refugee?
- Refugee.

610
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,399
Where's your passport?

611
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,159
Karin is here because you're a minor,
who arrived without a guardian.

612
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,999
A guardian must be present at your interview.

613
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:52,799
The interpreter is Iranian and I'm
Afghani, so we miscommunicate.

614
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,919
Let's start with the formalities.
What's your name?

615
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:03,999
Amin.

616
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:08,319
We need to know
how you got here.

617
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:16,719
There's nothing to worry about.
Just tell us what happened.

618
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:23,359
I'm interrogated for hours.

619
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:26,359
I'm the only survivor from my family.

620
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:31,679
I have to stick to the story
the smuggler gave me.

621
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,719
I saw my mother and sisters
get killed.

622
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:41,119
I'm sobbing. The damn story really
hits me, even though it's not true.

623
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:48,759
I'm crying uncontrollably.
The tears just keep coming.

624
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:57,559
My father and I hid in the desert
for a year, before he was killed.

625
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,679
I'm surprised to be crying
over something that isn't true.

626
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,439
It took a month to get
from Afghanistan to Denmark.

627
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,399
As soon as I'm done,
I write everything down,

628
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,279
word for word, in Dari,
in my notebook.

629
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,399
I have no one. I'm all alone.

630
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,559
That's the story I told...

631
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,319
...everyone ... until now.

632
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:44,839
It is not until we're driving
through the town square,

633
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,559
and I see the neon lights...

634
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,879
that I realize...

635
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:00,999
I'm not being sent back.

636
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,999
Hello?
- Abbas?

637
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,799
Amin?
-Yes.

638
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,039
Finally! Are you okay?
-Yes.

639
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,959
Where are you?

640
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,999
In Denmark.
-Oh...

641
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:39,519
Why didn't you call earlier?
- I couldn't find a phone.

642
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,119
What? I can't hear you.

643
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:45,399
I couldn't find a phone.
- Okay.

644
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,959
I'll make the call to Moscow.

645
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:54,199
They told me to say
you're all dead...

646
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,199
...but you're not...

647
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,559
What do I tell people?

648
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:09,639
What do I say?

649
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:17,359
You have to do what
the trafficker said. Keep it secret.

650
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,519
But...
- I'll try to figure out a way to meet.

651
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,359
I'll let you know.
Take care of yourself.

652
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,359
Okay, bye.

653
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:58,159
It took years before
I could visit my siblings in Stockholm.

654
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,479
It was very lonely and frustrating.

655
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,959
The fear of getting caught
and being sent back was so strong...

656
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:18,959
...that I couldn't tell the truth.
There were lots of consequences:

657
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,359
I couldn't be myself.

658
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,559
It was really painful.

659
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,959
Most people can't even
begin to imagine

660
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,479
how fleeing like that affects you...

661
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,479
what it means for your relationships
with other people...

662
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:44,519
how much it destroys you...

663
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,999
There were things
I couldn't say about my family,

664
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:56,079
like that I had siblings in Sweden,
and that my mother was alive,

665
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,679
because it didn't fit
my background story.

666
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,399
There were always constraints.

667
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,079
things had to be adjusted,
retained, and suppressed.

668
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,319
So, what did you want to talk about?
- I'd like some medicine.

669
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:23,439
Okay, you'll have to see the doctor,
but I can make an appointment.

670
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:28,719
What's wrong?
- We spoke about it last time...

671
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,559
the thing about me
being attracted to men.

672
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:37,919
Oh... Oh, that, yes.
- I'd like some medicine.

673
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,359
What do you mean?

674
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,319
I want to get well.

675
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,599
I don't want to like men.

676
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:56,319
It's not that I considered it a disease,
but I thought it could be cured,

677
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,719
that it was something
that could be cured.

678
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,919
But she told me that
it wasn't that simple.

679
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,399
Okay, fuck... It's something
that I have to live with:

680
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:20,719
the fear of being rejected
by your family

681
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,879
for being gay,
because it wasn't acceptable.

682
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,679
Family meant a lot to me then,
since I was all alone in Denmark.

683
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,639
Little brother, you're finally here!

684
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:35,879
It was the only reference point
in our fucking, crazy lives.

685
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,839
The thought of losing that
was very scary.

686
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,239
When are you going to find a girlfriend?
Aren't the girls in Denmark pretty?

687
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:52,679
Maybe I should come help you out.
I'm sure I could find one for you.

688
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,799
I didn't dare tell my brother.
I was in Stockholm,

689
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,119
and I had no plans to tell him,
but it just happened.

690
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:08,679
He kept pestering me
about not having a girlfriend.

691
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,439
Finally, I felt so intimidated
that I said:

692
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:18,799
"I don't have a girlfriend because
I'm not interested in girls that way."

693
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:22,079
Everyone went completely quiet.

694
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:33,519
Are you sure?

695
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,639
Yes.

696
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,479
Have you ever been with a girl?

697
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,119
Amin, let's go.

698
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,799
Where are we going?
- Just come.

699
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,119
Come.

700
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:53,119
Tell me what's going on.
- You'll see.

701
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:05,399
Go on. Have fun.

702
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,039
There's nothing to worry about.
We always knew.

703
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:40,879
Thank you.

704
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,519
Can I help you?
What would you like?

705
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:08,039
There I was. My first time
at a gay club, all by myself...

706
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:11,359
and I didn't go home....

707
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,359
I always made my career a priority.

708
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,519
When forced to choose between a guy
or a career and an education,

709
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,999
I always chose an education.
Cold and cynical.

710
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,919
Please welcome our next speaker:
Amin Nawabi.

711
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,279
My siblings sacrificed so much for me.

712
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,159
I had to do well.
I felt I had a huge responsibility.

713
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,999
It was important to be tough.

714
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,679
Only now, that I'm telling you about it,

715
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,239
do I start to realize how hard it's been.

716
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,759
It hurts to think back on it.

717
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:26,959
Of course.

718
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,759
Being back in the US...

719
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:37,559
I'm starting to get really tired
of constantly being on the move.

720
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,199
It's good for my career,

721
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,719
but it's not that good for...
- It's not that good for you.

722
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,479
It's not that good for me.

723
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,399
The first time I interviewed you
back home, you mentioned

724
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,999
that there were some things
you needed to come to terms with.

725
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,519
You grow up.
You grow up too fast.

726
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,639
When you flee as a child, it...

727
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,839
it takes time to learn

728
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,159
to trust people.

729
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:39,679
You're constantly on your guard,
all the time...

730
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:41,759
all the time...

731
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:49,039
Even when you're in a safe place,
you're on your guard.

732
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,119
I can feel that
something needs to happen.

733
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,919
Ta-da!

734
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:56,279
I'm not going to carry you
over the threshold.

735
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:01,039
You'd rather carry a cactus instead?
- It's kind of the same.

736
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,439
I'm just going to put this away.

737
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,559
It's a little...
- Yeah.

738
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:18,319
Look at the view.
It's stunning.

739
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:23,599
Every time you look at it,
you're just like, "Wow!"

740
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,799
The garden is really beautiful
right now.

741
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:34,199
I wonder if we have enough stuff
to fill the place.

742
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:50,359
Honey, I think I saw a big
raspberry patch just outside the lot.

743
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,999
Look! That's all raspberries!
- Wow!

744
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,759
- It's so nice.
- We just need to look after it.

745
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,839
It's wet here.
- You can see it from here.

746
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,639
The view of the house
is better here.

746
01:24:13,305 --> 01:25:13,337
