1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,345
He's always
out for trouble, that one.

3
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,852
That's for my father.

4
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,833
Shows over.

5
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,959
What's going on here then?

6
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,658
Sir.

7
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,762
Was that young
Armand I saw you fighting with?

8
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:55,763
Aye sir.

9
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,098
Over what?

10
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,545
Over crazy red, that
painter guy he used to know.

11
00:05:01,546 --> 00:05:03,469
Really?

12
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,313
He dropped that, sir.

13
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,211
I'll take it in.

14
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,555
At ease, soldier.

15
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,858
Causing trouble again I see.

16
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,799
You dropped your letter outside.

17
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,956
It's not my letter.

18
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,791
It's Vincent's.

19
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,131
It's to Theo Van Gogh.

20
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:29,403
That's Vincent's
brother, isn't it?

21
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:31,998
Yeah, Vincent left it behind.

22
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,571
His old landlord Geno was
having a clear out and found it.

23
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,845
So he gave it to my
father and father told me

24
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,739
I have to deliver it.

25
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,707
Like it's my business.

26
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:45,815
My job is to bash metal into
shape not Deliver letters.

27
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,857
Help yourself why don't you?

28
00:05:53,858 --> 00:05:56,698
Well he doesn't
need it, does he?

29
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,538
I don't see the point in
delivering a dead man's letter.

30
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:11,671
Your father just wants
to pay his respects.

31
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:13,072
What for?

32
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,908
What did that nobody
ever do for us?

33
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,712
Making my family hated
when my old man refused

34
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,514
to sign that petition.

35
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,721
To throw him out of the town-

36
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:24,283
- I signed it.

37
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,019
And, that's well and
good, he was mad.

38
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,087
He wasn't.

39
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:30,456
He was an interesting man.

40
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,959
Things only got strange
when that friend of his

41
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Gauguin cams.

42
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,141
<i>Vincent was all enthusiastic
for his yellow house</i>

43
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,570
<i>to become this
hostel for painters.</i>

44
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,607
<i>And, Gauguin would
be the master.</i>

45
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:49,212
Where's the chair'?

46
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,116
Yeah, perfect.

47
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,720
<i>But, when he finally came,</i>

48
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:01,393
<i>they quickly went from
firm friends to being</i>

49
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,155
<i>at each other's throats.</i>

50
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,123
No, no, no you can't Go.

51
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,424
No, you can't got.

52
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:40,660
Calm down, Vincent.

53
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,527
Beverly.

54
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:09,523
Hello Vincent.

55
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,323
I brought you a gift.

56
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,226
Have you been fighting?

57
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,461
Take good care of it.

58
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,462
Oh sweet.

59
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,708
Are you alright?

60
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,182
Interesting man?

61
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,414
That's not how I remember him.

62
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,765
That nutcase has
cut off his ear.

63
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,834
Your dad sewing
it back on is he?

64
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:54,166
No, he's helping.

65
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,612
Well that figures
one drunk and crazy

66
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:56,613
helping another.

67
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,674
Go on say it!

68
00:08:58,675 --> 00:08:59,707
Say it again.

69
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,524
The trial's next week.

70
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,629
Did not
think there were any left

71
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,032
not after him losing.

72
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:23,097
Oh they're
back, crawling back in.

73
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:25,537
Evening
gents, have you seen my son?

74
00:09:25,538 --> 00:09:28,704
Ah Mr. Roulin, yes
you'll find him inside.

75
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,870
He's meant to
be on a train to Paris.

76
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,817
He don't look like
he's planning on going anywhere

77
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:33,818
right now.

78
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:35,975
We'll soon see about that.

79
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,276
He's in trouble.

80
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:38,153
The boy looks for

81
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:39,912
it.

82
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,257
Evening Joseph.

83
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,759
Why can't You just post it?

84
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,725
I did, the letter
got returned as undeliverable.

85
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,434
Well if your postal
service can't find him,

86
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:57,463
what makes you think I can?

87
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,065
Just use your initiative son.

88
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,802
An important man like
Mr. Theo Van Gogh

89
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,170
ask around.

90
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,673
But, what do I
say when I find him?

91
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,944
It's customary to start
with I'm sorry for your loss.

92
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,013
Let's got You sobered up.

93
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,961
I can't Go it's too late.

94
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,366
It's a nice night.

95
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,545
You're lo convey
deepest condolences

96
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:42,481
from myself, your
mother, and your brother.

97
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:45,711
Oh, and don't forget
Little Marcel.

98
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,214
She was his friend too.

99
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:51,016
She was 10 months old.

100
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,352
Babes are like animals son.

101
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:58,123
They can know the heart of a
man just by the size of 'em.

102
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,959
No, they can't.

103
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,895
They're less fickle
than grown-ups.

104
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:05,130
Just look at Geno.

105
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,839
He takes Vincent's money
with a smile for a whole year

106
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,703
and then signs a
petition condemning him.

107
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:14,139
Hey, mind you say that
Geno had the letter

108
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,841
for two years.

109
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,651
I don't want Mr. Theo thinking
that we been sitting on it.

110
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,680
Tell him how Geno
didn't even bother

111
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:21,249
handing it over to
me until he heard

112
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,591
that Vincent had.

113
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,553
Killed himself?

114
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,194
Why do you find that
so hard to believe?

115
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:31,996
You saw what happened here.

116
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:33,095
He had a breakdown.

117
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,436
It Happens to people.

118
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:35,872
If they're weak.

119
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,268
Live longer, you'll see.

120
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,614
Life can even bring
down the strong.

121
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:52,378
After the ear, nobody would
even give him a chance.

122
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,347
<i>Even kids were tormenting him.</i>

123
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,759
Get out of here!

124
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,256
Go on, get out of here!

125
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,463
We are the kings.

126
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,133
<i>I call it weak
letting kids chase him</i>

127
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,101
<i>into the nuthouse.</i>

128
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:20,209
And his neighbors, and
the police, and the mayor,

129
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,545
and the whole town!

130
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,047
Against an ill man!

131
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,989
He even checked himself into
Saint Remy to get better

132
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,091
and so he did.

133
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,057
He got discharged cured.

134
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,562
It doesn't mean he
stayed cured, does it?

135
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:49,735
I feel absolutely calm
and in a normal state.

136
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:53,809
This is what he writes me
six weeks before he's dead.

137
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:59,111
How does a man go from
being absolutely calm

138
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,615
to being suicidal in six weeks?

139
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,794
It's sad, I get that.

140
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:12,660
But, what good will
delivering that letter do now?

141
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,636
They were very close.

142
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:21,111
Vincent would write
his brother every day.

143
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:26,505
I know I'm the one who
collected the letters.

144
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,679
If it were me, I'd want it.

145
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,546
If it was you, heavens
forbid, if you had died

146
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,182
and there was a letter out
there that you had sent to me,

147
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,183
I'd want it.

148
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:44,464
Wouldn't you want
it if it was me?

149
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,367
Whoa, lunatic!

150
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,570
We could go to the Park.

151
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:02,968
Yeah, but
It's probably still muddy.

152
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,108
I heard you were
Vincent's paint supplier.

153
00:15:05,109 --> 00:15:07,106
So I thought you
might know Theo.

154
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,874
We need a drink I think.

155
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,042
It's brandy.

156
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,276
Do take a seat.

157
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,654
He wasn't at the
address we've got.

158
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:15,421
The guy there said
you might know.

159
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm afraid you'll
never deliver that Letter

160
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,953
to Theo Van Gogh.

161
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:22,154
Oh, I see.

162
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,259
Well how come?

163
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:29,164
Two hearts, one mind
that's what Vincent told me.

164
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:35,134
<i>Maybe that was
the case after all</i>

165
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,003
<i>because after Vincent
died, Theo went</i>

166
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,771
<i>into sharp decline.</i>

167
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,641
Can I get you something my love?

168
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,143
<i>He'd been poorly before,</i>

169
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,920
<i>but Vincent's death
destroyed him.</i>

170
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,031
<i>He had actually been
with him a whole day</i>

171
00:15:54,032 --> 00:15:57,823
<i>at the end, but Vincent
insisted they use the time</i>

172
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,861
<i>to discuss life not death.</i>

173
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,436
<i>And, no suicide note either,
so it stayed a mystery.</i>

174
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,952
<i>And, Theo 'just keep asking why'?</i>

175
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:22,217
Six months after we buried
Vincent, Theo was dead loo.

176
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,860
Wow, the two of them.

177
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,530
So how did Vincent die?

178
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:37,062
He shot himself in
the fields above Auvers

179
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:40,044
by his easel doing what he
loved painting to the end.

180
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:41,567
Do you know why?

181
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,568
No.

182
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:48,876
<i>Theo thought his unhappiness
went right back to childhood.</i>

183
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:58,057
<i>He tried so hard to
fit into his family.</i>

184
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,730
<i>But, he never succeeded in this.</i>

185
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:16,372
<i>Vincent told me he was the
oldest but Not The first.</i>

186
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,885
<i>There was another Vincent,
a stillborn older brother:.</i>

187
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,356
<i>He thought that boy
was the perfect Vincent</i>

188
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:41,430
<i>that he could never measure
up to in his mother's eyes.</i>

189
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:55,548
<i>He struggled to be what
they wanted him to be.</i>

190
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:04,883
<i>He joined his uncle's
art dealership</i>

191
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:07,452
<i>and was thrown out in disgrace.</i>

192
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,091
<i>He tried for his father's
profession, the church,</i>

193
00:18:10,092 --> 00:18:12,591
<i>but the pastor exams
were too hard for him,</i>

194
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,827
<i>so he took a job as
a lowly missionary.</i>

195
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,502
<i>He managed to get
sacked even from that.</i>

196
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:20,599
<i>Yet another dead end.</i>

197
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,282
But, Theo says he
believes in him

198
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,948
and that if Vincent
will fight for himself,

199
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,190
he will fight alongside him.

200
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,330
And, that was it.

201
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,361
<i>Vincent picks up a brush
for the first time at 28,</i>

202
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,137
<i>and with Theo's support,
there is no stopping him.</i>

203
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,683
So what happened then?

204
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:07,021
Paris happened.

205
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,494
<i>He came here of course.</i>

206
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:11,550
<i>They all do.</i>

207
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,151
<i>Everyone does.</i>

208
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:17,522
<i>Monet, Toulouse, Seingnac,
Bernard, Manet, everybody</i>

209
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:21,893
<i>because everything that
happens in art happens here.</i>

210
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,534
<i>And, where do they
all buy their paints?</i>

211
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:26,476
<i>Pare Tanguy's of course.</i>

212
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,969
Waitress a drink.

213
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,970
Make it pure.

214
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,017
Cheers.

215
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:36,675
We'll see if it's pure.

216
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,677
We'll keep that, thank you.

217
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,479
Pure is purer.

218
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,393
We must Be fine,
to the buyer an ego

219
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,185
like no other I grant you.

220
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,521
But, a weekend painter.

221
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,591
Look at him always drawing.

222
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,394
What is it you were
saying on entry?

223
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,237
Which way up is it?

224
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,729
Grow up Henri.

225
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,868
Lei me finish
it in a minute for him.

226
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,776
Oh I forgot You can't.

227
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,536
You're being vile.

228
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,239
The vile doth deny.

229
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,720
<i>For many artists,
Paris is a final destination</i>

230
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:11,243
<i>but not for him.</i>

231
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,282
<i>It was a stopover to learn
what he needed to learn,</i>

232
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:17,582
<i>and then he was off in
search of his own path.</i>

233
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,017
You've done it.

234
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,588
It Was in his sleep.

235
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,966
It's the kindest thing.

236
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,231
I saw him once
more after two years.

237
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,473
<i>He was calmer, more assured.</i>

238
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,075
Take good care.

239
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:44,709
<i>And, I thought this is a man
whose story will end well.</i>

240
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,283
<i>His star finally rising,
his revolution won.</i>

241
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,222
So think how shocking
it was to be standing

242
00:20:57,223 --> 00:21:00,670
over Vincent's coffin
just six weeks later.

243
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:03,662
So sad.

244
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,469
For many he died
a martyr for art,

245
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,270
but for me, it seems odd.

246
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,572
Why?

247
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:16,475
In only eight
years, he had traveled

248
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,583
from amateur to an artist
of influence, unbelievable.

249
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,750
<i>Monet declared him
the shining star</i>

250
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,425
<i>of the Independent
Artist's Fair.</i>

251
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,861
<i>And, he was cured
according to his doctor,</i>

252
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:39,969
<i>Dr. Gachet who had looked
after Vincent in Auvers.</i>

253
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,005
<i>I met him at the funeral.</i>

254
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:51,114
<i>There were just a few
artists from Paris and him.</i>

255
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,121
<i>I could've thought he
was Vincent's brother.</i>

256
00:21:56,122 --> 00:21:57,992
<i>He was the one who
made the speech,</i>

257
00:21:57,993 --> 00:22:00,652
<i>and he cried all
the way through it.</i>

258
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,395
<i>And, an hour later he was
running around taking Vincent's</i>

259
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:07,292
<i>best paintings off the
wall as if they were his.</i>

260
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,968
<i>And, they were, his fee,
for treating Vincent.</i>

261
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,904
<i>It seemed odd that the doctor
had Theo's full confidence.</i>

262
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,510
<i>I understand he's still
close to the Van Gogh family.</i>

263
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:27,746
<i>Maybe you should ask
him why Vincent did it.</i>

264
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,916
It's my father who
wanted to know why.

265
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,592
I just wanted to deliver
this letter for him.

266
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,367
The Van Gogh's are
only ghosts in Paris now.

267
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,429
I'm afraid you're
going to have to take

268
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,537
this letter back to your
father with my condolences.

269
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,424
Dear Father,
looks like I'm continuing

270
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,117
my journey.

271
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,054
I need to find a new recipient
as unfortunately Theo

272
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,055
is dead.

273
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,234
There is this doctor who
I believe is the person

274
00:23:14,235 --> 00:23:16,561
to entrust the letter lo.

275
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,697
So, I'm going to Auvers.

276
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:21,099
Make some excuse to my boss.

277
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,839
Morning mam.

278
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,140
Yes.

279
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,087
I'm here
to see Dr. Gachel.

280
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:05,310
Really?

281
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,289
Do you happen to
have an appointment?

282
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,579
No.

283
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,849
I have a letter from
Vincent Van Gogh,

284
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,954
a friend of my
father's from home.

285
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:13,955
Do you now?

286
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,490
You know he's
actually passed away?

287
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:19,367
Yes.

288
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,629
The doctor's in Paris.

289
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,606
He won't be back till tomorrow.

290
00:24:22,607 --> 00:24:25,597
I'll make sure the
doctor gets the letter.

291
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,966
I'd rather deliver it in person.

292
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,947
I want to ask the
doctor about Vincent.

293
00:24:29,948 --> 00:24:32,506
Well I can tell you about him.

294
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
He was evil.

295
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,043
Is that a medical opinion?

296
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:41,719
I could tell at first glance
it would end in trouble.

297
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,170
<i>He had these,</i>

298
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:00,332
- Hello?
- Hello mam.

299
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,803
<i>Bewildered eyes
in which there was</i>

300
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:06,306
<i>something insane, something
which you dare not look.</i>

301
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:10,310
Just straight through at the
back in the garden actually.

302
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:31,696
<i>Well nothing has been the
same since he came here.</i>

303
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,331
I'll get you a message.

304
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:34,868
Tell me when it's convenient
for the doctor to see you

305
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,210
where are you in residence?

306
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:39,204
Where did Vincent reside?

307
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:41,005
Oh at the Ravoux Inn.

308
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,576
Well you can find me there.

309
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:44,282
No, you don't
Want to stay there.

310
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:45,543
It's a hole.

311
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,246
Doctor booked him
somewhere proper.

312
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,249
But, probably suited
him better in a hole.

313
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:55,019
Well still that's
where you can send word.

314
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,690
You're not gonna stir
things up again are you?

315
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,864
I've had quite enough
weeping over that nutcase

316
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:02,227
in this household.

317
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,479
(rain pattering}.

318
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,423
You looking for something?

319
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,903
Looking for the owner.

320
00:26:33,904 --> 00:26:35,560
Speaking to her.

321
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,495
You're the owner'?

322
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,602
Well my parents are, but
they're visiting me auntie,

323
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:44,903
so I guess for the next two
days I'm the proprietress.

324
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,238
That's a fine dress.

325
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,741
Suitable attire
for a proprietress.

326
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,779
I don't get lo
wear it that often

327
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,311
when my father's hers.

328
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,113
Always got errands for ma.

329
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,981
Well that's life.

330
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,283
Fancy something?

331
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,958
I won't say no to a hot coffee.

332
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,934
So what brings you lo Auvers?

333
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:19,170
A friend of my father's
Vincent Van Gogh.

334
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:22,607
We just found out
he killed himself.

335
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,275
He stayed here.

336
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,276
I know.

337
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,148
Were you here when it happened?

338
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,822
It was so dreadful.

339
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,655
<i>I sewed the tenants
dinner at seven.</i>

340
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,024
<i>And, he wasn't there.</i>

341
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,698
<i>He came later though.</i>

342
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:47,232
<i>But, something was very wrong.</i>

343
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:52,839
Mr. Vincent?

344
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,146
Vincent, are you alright sir?

345
00:27:54,147 --> 00:27:57,143
My father went after him.

346
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,345
Vincent?

347
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,747
What's happened Vincent?

348
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,022
Are you alright?

349
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,251
Oh my God!

350
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,087
What have you done?

351
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,068
I tried to kill myself.

352
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,167
<i>And Dr.
Gachet was called.</i>

353
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,705
<i>He didn't even say
one word to Vincent.</i>

354
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:24,908
<i>The two of them just
looked at each other</i>

355
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:26,679
<i>like two angry wolves.</i>

356
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,848
<i>And, Vincent's lying on this bed</i>

357
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,515
<i>and a bulletin his belly.</i>

358
00:28:33,516 --> 00:28:35,852
<i>He's crying out in pain
asking when someone</i>

359
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:39,227
would remove it, and Dr.
Gachet, an ex military doctor,

360
00:28:39,228 --> 00:28:42,453
I mean he should know
how to remove a bullet.

361
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,088
He does nothing!

362
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,859
<i>He just decided the case
was hopeless and left.</i>

363
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,704
<i>The next morning rumors
about Vincent had spread</i>

364
00:28:50,705 --> 00:28:52,697
<i>all over town.</i>

365
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:54,735
<i>And, at eight o'clock,
Gendarme Rigaumon</i>

366
00:28:54,736 --> 00:28:55,939
<i>comes knocking.</i>

367
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,304
What are you doing?

368
00:28:59,305 --> 00:29:00,613
Can't you leave
the man in peace?

369
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,311
Can't you see he's not Well?

370
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:05,619
I'm just being thorough,
Mr. Ravoux, that's all.

371
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,885
Where's the gun?

372
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,148
No idea.

373
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,382
No idea.

374
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,319
<i>My father sent him away.</i>

375
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,163
<i>He said Rigaumon
is the last person</i>

376
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,635
<i>a dying man should have to see.</i>

377
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,401
Mr. Theo came in the
afternoon, and he comes in

378
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:24,931
yelling, "What happened?

379
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,564
"How?"

380
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:35,110
<i>That was the terrible thing
is that no one really knew.</i>

381
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:42,013
<i>And, then, you know,
it was normal and calm.</i>

382
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,182
<i>And, you know I honestly thought.</i>

383
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:46,317
<i>It was all gonna lo he fine.</i>

384
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,424
If only I could've
been one of them.

385
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:56,928
<i>But, as the
night came, a fever in him</i>

386
00:29:56,929 --> 00:29:59,597
<i>rose, and he was getting weaker.</i>

387
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:01,704
<i>And, about half past one,
Theo comes downstairs.</i>

388
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,741
<i>And, we all knew
that is was over,</i>

389
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,448
<i>and Vincent was dead.</i>

390
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,697
What do you think happened?

391
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,532
Did you see it coming?

392
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,568
He was happy here.

393
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,370
I honestly thought He was.

394
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:50,408
You know Dr. Gachet tried to
gel him to say somewhere else?

395
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,876
But, no.

396
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:54,145
<i>He liked our place.</i>

397
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:57,059
No, you're going
to ruin your dress.

398
00:31:58,217 --> 00:31:59,252
Well you're light.

399
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:00,559
You'll get messy.

400
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,286
Do you want a room?

401
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,163
It depends on the cost?

402
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:04,422
Come on you.

403
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,724
How much is the room?

404
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:09,494
It depends on the room.

405
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:11,395
Another foreigner.

406
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:14,932
<i>He liked us, and we liked him.</i>

407
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,668
He was a nice, quiet man.

408
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:18,736
Sure.

409
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,148
What you didn't like him?

410
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:21,739
It's not that I-

411
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,740
- He could do unusual things
because he was painting,

412
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,948
but otherwise he was normal.

413
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,578
Unusual how?

414
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,650
On his first day, I
remember because it was

415
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:32,350
a day like today.

416
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,458
This big storm broke, and
everyone's rushing for shelter.

417
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,690
<i>And, I saw him.</i>

418
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,363
<i>He's just standing there
in the rain, in his suit.</i>

419
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:45,274
<i>And, I thought, you know,
must be first day excitement.</i>

420
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:49,177
But, no he was always like that.

421
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,541
Always painting day in, day
out no matter what the weather.

422
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,548
I heard he was
close to the doctor.

423
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:00,778
What Dr. Gachet?

424
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,452
No, I wouldn't have said that.

425
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:05,149
He kept rather to himself.

426
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,785
He was definitely
close to his brother

427
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,891
judging by the
amount of letters.

428
00:33:09,892 --> 00:33:12,223
I know my dad was his postman.

429
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,328
So you know.

430
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,305
I was wondering when he
slept painting all day,

431
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:20,898
<i>writing these long
letters, always reading</i>

432
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:23,212
<i>these fat hooks.</i>

433
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,839
I guess you could say
he was well organized.

434
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,172
Vincent?

435
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,709
Yeah, you could set
your watch by him.

436
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,347
<i>Painting from eight until five.</i>

437
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:36,258
<i>You'd think he was going
off to a regular job.</i>

438
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:40,355
He went all over, Chaponval,
the fields, the woods,

439
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:43,554
the river.

440
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:46,991
He really liked the river.

441
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,326
Speak to the boatman,

442
00:33:48,327 --> 00:33:49,327
Watch your step.

443
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,830
He'll tell you.

444
00:33:50,831 --> 00:33:51,996
Oh dear.

445
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,067
I'm in.

446
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,736
Enjoy yourselves ladies.

447
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,201
Thank you so much.

448
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,202
Bye.

449
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:03,241
Armand Roulin friend of
the late Vincent Van Gogh.

450
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:04,742
Pleasure.

451
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,845
I heard he liked to
hang around the river.

452
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,380
Vincent, yeah.

453
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,682
Yeah, he used to come down here.

454
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:15,756
Even before dawn to catch
some special kind of light.

455
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,860
Now I don't know much
about light catching,

456
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:22,429
but I know you can set your
eyes on a lot of life down here

457
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,428
if you catch my drift?

458
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,730
Good lo know.

459
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,299
He didn't talk so much.

460
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,407
Mostly just sat around
watching, sometimes painting.

461
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,109
And, this one time
it was just us,

462
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,378
me fishing, him painting.

463
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:43,581
Now it wasn't as
peaceful as it sounds.

464
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,926
He made all sorts of
noises while he painted

465
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,952
puffing like a steam engine.

466
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,594
<i>And, then suddenly
it was all silent,</i>

467
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:00,097
<i>and he looked so happy
that This dirty crow</i>

468
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,441
<i>was coming close.</i>

469
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:07,772
<i>He didn't seem to care that
it ran off with his lunch.</i>

470
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:12,276
And, I thought to myself
how lonely is this guy

471
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:16,123
that even a thieving crow
brightens up his day?

472
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,529
Later that summer, he would
hang around these rich boys

473
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,626
who threw big boating parties.

474
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:32,697
<i>They always came with girls,
unruly ones if you know</i>

475
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:33,540
<i>what I mean?</i>

476
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,032
Hey!

477
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,473
Yeah we could
do with a bit of money.

478
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,135
Well is it paid?

479
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:38,876
<i>Vincent seems shy around them.</i>

480
00:35:38,877 --> 00:35:40,271
Come on.

481
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,809
He never did have
much luck with women.

482
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,342
You think?

483
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:47,545
And, then he comes here
with the Gachet girl.

484
00:35:47,546 --> 00:35:50,815
I saw her pretty in a
porcelain sort of way.

485
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,387
That's her, a real quiet type.

486
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,391
I've been working
in (his village

487
00:35:56,392 --> 00:35:58,126
since before the
Gachefs moved here,

488
00:35:58,127 --> 00:36:00,660
and I never got to
speak a word with her.

489
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:04,732
<i>Yet her and Vincent, they
were chatting in that way,</i>

490
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,903
<i>you know, like speaking
to each other was</i>

491
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:10,243
<i>the most exciting thing ever.</i>

492
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,577
<i>All I could see
was just your foot.</i>

493
00:36:13,578 --> 00:36:15,573
<i>God knows what she saw in him.</i>

494
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,386
Must've been twice her
age, and next to her,

495
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,579
he looked like a tramp.

496
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,015
What, you think there
was something going on?

497
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,893
They said they
were here to paint,

498
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:30,059
but they took a boat,
couples often do.

499
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,860
But, I will tell you this.

500
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:39,206
Vincent, he looked
like he was all right.

501
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,867
Then he comes here with
a girl who I reckon

502
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,541
was out of his league,
and the next thing I hear

503
00:36:44,542 --> 00:36:46,106
he's killed himself.

504
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,574
Maybe you should talk to her.

505
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,944
I'm not sure their
housekeeper would let me.

506
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:54,945
That one.

507
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,550
Spends her afternoons
at the church.

508
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,622
She's some kind of warden there.

509
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,793
She certainly wards me off.

510
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,595
Here you must be thirsty.

511
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:12,930
On the house.

512
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,398
How nice you are?

513
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,100
Won't your dad mind?

514
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,768
He's not here to mind.

515
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,113
I'll tell you what
I'll have this one

516
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,551
if you let me buy one for you.

517
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:33,918
I was wondering were Vincent
and Marguerite friends?

518
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,955
The boatman said
they were friendly.

519
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:37,831
Well that would
explain why she takes

520
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:39,957
flowers to his grave everyday.

521
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,335
Oh, and it might explain
that big argument

522
00:37:41,336 --> 00:37:43,394
between him and the doctor.

523
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,728
What argument?

524
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,140
More than one person
saw Vincent leave

525
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,004
the doctor's place
slamming the gale so hard

526
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:50,275
it's a wonder it didn't
come off its hinges.

527
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,270
But, the housekeeper,
she was going round

528
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,772
saying that Dr. Gachel
had stopped Vincent

529
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,974
from seeing his daughter.

530
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,818
Dr. Gachel is crazy
protective over his daughter.

531
00:37:58,819 --> 00:38:02,012
He doesn't want her talking,
where are you going?

532
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,013
To church.

533
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,326
God bless.

534
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:21,001
Oh glad to see you're honoring
God, not like your friend.

535
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,774
My father's friend.

536
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,447
You know Vincent actually
did his ungodly act

537
00:38:30,448 --> 00:38:31,448
on a Sunday?

538
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,346
That's not the half of it.

539
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:36,883
I saw him that Day.

540
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,387
<i>I was on my way to church.</i>

541
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,456
<i>Laughing and joking with
those Sacretain boys,</i>

542
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:48,993
<i>drinking they were
laughing at God,</i>

543
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:53,030
knowing what he was going
to be doing on God's day.

544
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:55,973
When I think what he put
the poor doctor through,

545
00:38:55,974 --> 00:38:58,408
marching in with his brother
like they were royally,

546
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:01,643
like it was his garden,
like they were his guests.

547
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:04,308
Well his brother might
have been dressed smart,

548
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:05,811
but it looked like
he'd dropped down dead

549
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:07,915
before he made it to table.

550
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:13,395
I could see the fever in
his eyes at first glance.

551
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,261
And, the great artist himself,
always skulking about,

552
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:28,365
gobbling our food, just
making messes in corners.

553
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:32,943
Oh well, mustn't keep
our Lord wailing.

554
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,309
I wondered how long it
would take you to come back.

555
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:20,885
He painted you didn't he?

556
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,130
So why are you here?

557
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,799
Where else would I be?

558
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,141
Oh, I don't know let's see.

559
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:41,305
Sailing around the
world, catching a thief,

560
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,808
chatting up a pretty girl.

561
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:46,482
Because I want to do
something for Vincent.

562
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,419
I'm sure there's a
lot you can do for him

563
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,919
now that he's dead.

564
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,361
I heard you take flowers
to his grave everyday.

565
00:40:58,362 --> 00:41:00,529
Isn't that doing
something for Vincent

566
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,292
even though he's dead?

567
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,293
Oh that.

568
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,831
I just do that out of respect.

569
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,867
He was a great artist.

570
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,201
He liked flowers.

571
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:14,271
Still seems real nice of you.

572
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,343
You must've been friendly.

573
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,710
I wouldn't say so.

574
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:21,281
<i>He was here to see father.</i>

575
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,356
<i>He was his doctor, and
he became his friend.</i>

576
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:33,836
<i>It's hardly surprising.</i>

577
00:41:33,837 --> 00:41:35,492
<i>They were both artists.</i>

578
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,494
<i>They liked the same painters.</i>

579
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,634
<i>They understood each other.</i>

580
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,334
<i>When father invited
Vincent's brother</i>

581
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,640
<i>and their family for
Sunday lunch, Vincent joked</i>

582
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,980
<i>about my father was
the third brother.</i>

583
00:41:46,981 --> 00:41:48,382
Cheers everyone.

584
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:53,883
So you were like
one big family than?

585
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,056
He painted here sometimes.

586
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,862
<i>It was part of the treatment
my father recommended.</i>

587
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,870
<i>But, we didn't socialize.</i>

588
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,941
So when you went to the river,

589
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:23,273
that wasn't socializing?

590
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,708
The river?

591
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:26,450
The boatman says you
took a boat together,

592
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:28,946
said it looked like you
knew each other pretty well.

593
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,620
Well people think they
see all sorts of things

594
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:31,889
in this village.

595
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:34,592
Must've been some other girl.

596
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,020
Hold you I barely knew him.

597
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:39,523
It was father he was here for.

598
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:40,764
They were like minds.

599
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:42,693
They agreed on everything.

600
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,264
Everything really?

601
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,032
Ravoux girl said Vincent
and Dr. Gachet argued.

602
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,802
My you really have
been slumming it.

603
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,704
I don't care for village gossip.

604
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,706
She said people saw
Vincent storming out of here

605
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,415
not long before his death,
and your dad was running

606
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:59,443
after him.

607
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:00,444
So what?

608
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,919
You think there was some
argument with my father

609
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,650
and that's why Vincent is dead?

610
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:09,063
You think it's my
father's fault do you?

611
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,587
I didn't say that.

612
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,161
I think it would be
best if you leave now.

613
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,336
Good day.

614
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,252
Thank you.

615
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:43,161
Busy night?

616
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:43,996
Not really.

617
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:45,522
There's your cheese.

618
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:46,763
And how is your father, Adeline?

619
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:48,260
He's well, thank you.

620
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,693
Can I get you anything else?

621
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:50,466
No, I'm fine thank you.

622
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:51,303
Thank you, no.

623
00:43:51,304 --> 00:43:52,763
Good.

624
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,800
Just busy enough not
to have to speak to me?

625
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,433
Well if I did sit
down for a drink,

626
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:57,811
I'd be wondering when
you'd be getting up

627
00:43:57,812 --> 00:44:00,976
and running off
somewhere more important.

628
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,542
Funny thing that.

629
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:08,820
You actually gave me an idea.

630
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,716
The idea to confront
Marguerite Gachet.

631
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:15,456
Oh so you ran off lo be
with the lady of the manor?

632
00:44:15,457 --> 00:44:17,057
How did that work out for you?

633
00:44:17,058 --> 00:44:19,823
She told me she
didn't know Vincent.

634
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:24,061
Hadn't barely exchanged a
few formal words with him.

635
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:28,365
I told you you can't believe
a word the Gachefs say.

636
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,134
<i>I remember when
Vincent moved in.</i>

637
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:34,673
<i>People were asking him if
he was a relative of Gachet.</i>

638
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:38,475
<i>Maybe they were
similar on the outside.</i>

639
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,486
This is incredible.

640
00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:43,480
<i>They had the same red hair,</i>

641
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:45,518
<i>and that same sad
look in his eyes.</i>

642
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:48,360
I've never seen
anything like it.

643
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,230
<i>But, on the inside,
they were chalk and cheese.</i>

644
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:21,051
<i>Vincent wasn't
snobbish like Gachet.</i>

645
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,464
<i>He was really polite and kind.</i>

646
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,600
Well hello, Jeuxmaine.

647
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:32,896
Up you go.

648
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,799
So what shall we draw tonight?

649
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,038
A chicken please.

650
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,275
I might be seeing something.

651
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:39,612
Okay a chicken.

652
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,372
Skinny legs like you.

653
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:43,645
Floppy tail please.

654
00:45:43,646 --> 00:45:44,551
Jomaine what are

655
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:46,810
you doing out of bed?

656
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,712
She's no trouble.

657
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:50,386
Come on off to bed with you.

658
00:45:50,387 --> 00:45:52,149
She's no trouble.

659
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,154
I want my chicken back.

660
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,324
Marguerite said the
brother came here.

661
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:02,392
Did you meet him?

662
00:46:02,393 --> 00:46:06,102
No, I heard he came
at Gachefs invitation.

663
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:10,770
Vincent was always saying
that they might come here.

664
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:13,749
Always checking if we
had rooms at weekends,

665
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,739
but they never did come.

666
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,911
So did Vincent visit them ever?

667
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:20,581
No, you know he'd
spend hours on hours

668
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:22,181
writing those letters
to his brother

669
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:24,786
when he could've just
hopped on a train.

670
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:26,850
Oh no, he did go once.

671
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:30,420
He said his brother's
baby was ill.

672
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,867
But, I don't think the
visit went that well.

673
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:34,291
. Why not?

674
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,193
The lea towels.

675
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,606
<i>He said that canvasses
were too expensive.</i>

676
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:39,830
More.

677
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:40,639
<i>And so now he's only gonna paint</i>

678
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,965
<i>on these old rags.</i>

679
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,307
He painted some pretty
flowers, but I don't think

680
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:49,873
my father was that pleased.

681
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:54,517
What has the brother
got to do with lea towels?

682
00:46:54,518 --> 00:46:57,152
I reckon they argued over money

683
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:05,122
because it was the
brother that bought

684
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:08,358
all Vincent's painting things.

685
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:12,062
<i>I know because of the
last letter Vincent sent.</i>

686
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:13,201
Adeline wait.

687
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,676
<i>The day before
he killed himself.</i>

688
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,909
<i>When he handed it to me,
he said it was urgent.</i>

689
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:24,578
<i>And, you know I asked if
there was anything wrong.</i>

690
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:26,645
<i>And, he said he'd run out
of paints and he placed</i>

691
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:29,056
<i>a big order for some
more 'cause he had lots</i>

692
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:30,881
<i>of paintings planned.</i>

693
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:32,986
Don't you think
that's odd to place

694
00:47:32,987 --> 00:47:35,828
an order with his brother
ii money was an issue

695
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:39,656
between them and then to
kill himself the next day?

696
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:42,893
It depends, you know,
on how balanced he was.

697
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,828
All seemed fine with him.

698
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:48,532
I mean something must've
happened pretty suddenly

699
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,834
for him to become unbalanced.

700
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,202
Like what?

701
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,444
I don't know exactly what.

702
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:59,409
I'm sure it's got something
to do with Gachet.

703
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:03,180
Do you remember his first
day that I told you about?

704
00:48:03,181 --> 00:48:05,092
This letter's from then.

705
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,124
No, I can't Read
someone else's letter.

706
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,859
If it's open, it's all right.

707
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,790
My dad's
posted me up some money.

708
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,258
I'll open a tab for you,

709
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,465
and you can settle up
when your money arrives.

710
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,566
That's very good of you.

711
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,978
This is where he lived?

712
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:33,549
And, where he died.

713
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:52,799
<i>Dear Theo and Jo,</i>

714
00:48:56,834 --> 00:49:00,003
<i>it is really very
beautiful here.</i>

715
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,280
<i>I feel I see the
North all the better</i>

716
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:04,275
<i>for my trip to the South.</i>

717
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:09,012
<i>I have settled down
to some canvasses</i>

718
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:11,014
<i>which I hope will go
some way lo recovering</i>

719
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:12,653
<i>the pasts of my slay.</i>

720
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:16,329
<i>Dr. Gachet is eccentric.</i>

721
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,364
<i>I don't Know how he
thinks he can cure me</i>

722
00:49:20,365 --> 00:49:24,161
<i>when he seems at
least as sick as I am.</i>

723
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:26,335
<i>However, I still
think that what I have</i>

724
00:49:26,336 --> 00:49:30,167
<i>is mostly a malady of the
South, and the the return here</i>

725
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:34,204
<i>will be enough to
dissipate the whole thing.</i>

726
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:36,811
<i>The thing is the days seem like,</i>

727
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:42,986
<i>seem like weeks.</i>

728
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,853
<i>The days seem like weeks to me.</i>

729
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,829
<i>I'll be glad is sometime from
now you were lo come here</i>

730
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,666
<i>one Sunday with your family.</i>

731
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:58,163
<i>Very hardy handshakes,
your loving Vincent.</i>

732
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,570
What the?

733
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:14,641
Oy, come here!

734
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:20,274
Dear
father, I'm still waiting to see

735
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:21,871
the doctor.

736
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:23,510
I could've just given the
letter to the housekeeper

737
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:27,310
or his daughter, but something
happened with Vincent

738
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,212
in that house.

739
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:30,714
I can tell.

740
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:33,491
I want to ask the
doctor about it.

741
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,128
I've decided to retrace
the path that Vincent took

742
00:52:39,129 --> 00:52:43,126
with his easel that Day
because what I've been told

743
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:44,299
doesn't add up.

744
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,375
And, strange things are
happening to me too,

745
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:52,535
but don't worry, nothing
that I can't handle.

746
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:55,472
People here are on
edge about Vincent,

747
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:57,374
about what happened to him.

748
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,043
Everyone has a different story.

749
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:01,751
Tanguy, the paint
supplier, said that Vincent

750
00:53:01,752 --> 00:53:04,381
shot himself in the
fields, so does the girl

751
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:05,383
from the inn.

752
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,761
It seems a very long way
for him to have walked

753
00:53:09,762 --> 00:53:13,757
with a mortal would, and
I wonder if he wanted

754
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:17,594
to kill himself, why didn't
He just pick up the gun

755
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,165
and finish the job?

756
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:22,874
Did he change his mind?

757
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,780
Did he want to live after all?

758
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,519
No, I can see you.

759
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:46,456
It was you last
night weren't it?

760
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,561
Oh, not again.

761
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,420
Can I help?

762
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,059
If you could tell me where
to find a funny looking boy

763
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,729
with hair all over the place,
I want to ring his neck.

764
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,794
Oh that'll be my nephew.

765
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:25,637
I'm sorry.

766
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:26,766
He's a bit simple.

767
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,641
Please don't pay him any mind.

768
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:29,999
He's harmless.

769
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,303
He was following me
yesterday and today.

770
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:35,138
That's not like him.

771
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,776
Did you do something to him?

772
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,651
No, I'm just delivering a letter

773
00:54:38,652 --> 00:54:41,744
for a friend of mine,
Vincent Van Gogh.

774
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,851
The Painter fella, yeah
foreigner, red fellow.

775
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:46,950
Yeah that's him.

776
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,252
That'll be it then.

777
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,130
That'll be what then?

778
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,991
Here cider'?

779
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:58,361
Don't mind if I do.

780
00:54:58,362 --> 00:55:00,638
Thatching is thirsty work.

781
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:10,340
On the day that the
painter fellow was wounded,

782
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:12,617
<i>we heard a shot
coming from that barn.</i>

783
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:20,683
<i>And, now my nephew, he
thinks it's haunted.</i>

784
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,853
But, Vincent shot
himself in the fields.

785
00:55:23,854 --> 00:55:26,189
That's what some folks say.

786
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:30,793
But, I never met a person
who actually saw him there.

787
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:35,064
The police looked for his
stuff, and they found nothing,

788
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:39,302
not the gun nor his painting
stuff, nor his paintings.

789
00:55:39,303 --> 00:55:41,249
And, who'd steal
that sort of thing?

790
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,311
So you think he shot
himself here in that barn?

791
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,712
I'm not saying nothing.

792
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,881
We just heard a shot.

793
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,055
Well why didn't
you go in and look?

794
00:55:54,056 --> 00:55:58,755
It could've been anything,
kids shooting rats.

795
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,702
No, it were only the
next day when I heard

796
00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:03,860
that he'd been shot
that I went and looked.

797
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,562
And, there was nothing.

798
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:08,703
Ii shot himself here, how
come you didn't see his stuff?

799
00:56:08,704 --> 00:56:10,733
That is the question.

800
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,504
It's not that he was in a
state to move it himself,

801
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:17,206
and why would
anyone else move it?

802
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,278
Oh afternoon Mr. Roulin.

803
00:56:22,613 --> 00:56:27,116
How nice of you to save
me the trip to that place.

804
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,724
Doctor sent me to tell you he
can see you tomorrow morning.

805
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:32,288
Slop in at any time.

806
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:35,028
Great, I was just
thinking what you said

807
00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:37,801
about Vincent laughing
around and drinking

808
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:40,930
with those lads on
the day of his death.

809
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,069
Where was that?

810
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:47,203
Well it was right
here, exactly here.

811
00:56:47,204 --> 00:56:49,980
Scribbling and scrawling
away he was as always.

812
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:53,977
So he must've already
had the gun on him then?

813
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:56,613
Yeah, I guess he must have.

814
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:59,286
Well he might've had it
amongst his paintings.

815
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:01,820
Wouldn't want to put
it on display would he?

816
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:04,125
Where do you think
he got it from?

817
00:57:04,126 --> 00:57:07,000
Ravoux girl said Gachet
was a military man.

818
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:08,925
Has a gun I guess.

819
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:11,598
You think he could've
taken it from your place?

820
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,665
- Not unless he
pill: it hack after.

821
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:15,431
The doctor does have
a gun in his study,

822
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:16,672
but I dust there
every afternoon.

823
00:57:16,673 --> 00:57:18,801
It's never been elsewhere.

824
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,438
Anyway, everyone knows
it was old Ravoux's gun.

825
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,642
He keeps it under the
counter, little pistol.

826
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,644
And, it's not there anymore.

827
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,488
Well, see you tomorrow.

828
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,934
You were out early.

829
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:47,363
Long day-

830
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,699
Thirsty work.

831
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:57,844
And, you've been quenching
that thirst I suppose.

832
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,291
Today I heard mention
of young lads Vincent

833
00:58:03,292 --> 00:58:05,048
would hang around with.

834
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,221
That would be the Sacretains,

835
00:58:06,222 --> 00:58:07,456
but you won't Find them here.

836
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:09,152
They're in Paris.

837
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:12,965
They would often joke around
with Vincent especially Rene.

838
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:21,043
<i>Rene could also take
it a little far.</i>

839
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,740
<i>Poor Vincent, he nearly fainted.</i>

840
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:34,510
But, then Rene would buy
him a drink to apologize.

841
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,752
He was like that always
picking up the tab,

842
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:39,023
always buying people drinks.

843
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:45,421
I was also told that Vincent
got the gun from your place.

844
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:46,422
What?

845
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:49,325
Who told you that?

846
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:50,993
We don't even have a gun.

847
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,564
Gachefs housekeeper
told me you did.

848
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:55,565
No.

849
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,608
Father used to own one
once, but he didn't reckon

850
00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:02,705
he'd need it here in
Auvers, so he sold it.

851
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,413
Before Vincent was shot?

852
00:59:04,414 --> 00:59:05,742
Yes.

853
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:07,780
We didn't have it
than, and don't you go

854
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:10,850
spreading that
squawking hen's gossip.

855
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,120
This came for you.

856
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:19,897
It says that you've
lost your job.

857
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:24,594
So you're not Good for credit.

858
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:27,196
Room for one more at your fire?

859
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:31,634
You look like
you've had a day of it.

860
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:35,638
The Ravoux girl deprived
me of my roof for the night.

861
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,585
Here that'll warm you.

862
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:47,617
Now that's something different.

863
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:48,892
My own recipe.

864
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,997
So why did the Ravoux
girl get the hump'!

865
00:59:56,998 --> 00:59:59,634
Cause I said that maybe
Vincent got the gun from them.

866
00:59:59,635 --> 01:00:03,009
No, no old Ravoux
sold his gun lo Rene.

867
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,902
Everyone knows that.

868
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,642
He wanted it for a
stupid cowboy costume.

869
01:00:08,643 --> 01:00:11,347
He was running around
waving it in people's faces

870
01:00:11,348 --> 01:00:14,254
pretending he was
in the Wild West.

871
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:22,224
Good customers, but bad sorts
especially the younger one.

872
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:27,461
<i>Vincent was being gentlemanly
towards the girls,</i>

873
01:00:27,462 --> 01:00:31,794
<i>and Rene barges in, "Girls,
don't Be bothering with him.</i>

874
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,263
<i>"He cutoff his dick
as well as his ear."</i>

875
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,264
And, his ear.

876
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:39,669
Let's go.

877
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,040
These ones are mine.

878
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,280
Gaston, come on.

879
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:50,690
I'd have smacked the
run! If he said that to me.

880
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:53,282
So why didn't you then?

881
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,194
It wasn't my business.

882
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:58,487
It wasn't my fight.

883
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,324
So why didn't you
make it your fight?

884
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,066
If I said what I
wanted to every lad,

885
01:01:03,067 --> 01:01:04,835
I'd have no customers.

886
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:11,706
Won't you just.

887
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,244
I could've used that.

888
01:01:15,245 --> 01:01:17,376
You could've said
something to the boys.

889
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:19,410
Couldn't you see they
were bullying him?

890
01:01:19,411 --> 01:01:22,311
I told you Vincent
was hanging around them.

891
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:23,914
If he didn't want to be
there, he could've stood up

892
01:01:23,915 --> 01:01:24,915
and left.

893
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,686
Maybe he was there because
Rene always picked up the tab.

894
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,393
Or, he just felt lonely and
liked being around young people

895
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:35,061
who were enjoying themselves.

896
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:36,401
How is it my business?

897
01:01:36,402 --> 01:01:38,168
No, you've had enough.

898
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,666
Very friendly oi
you, turning your hack

899
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,234
just like with Vincent.

900
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:47,340
What did you do for him?

901
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:51,040
I don't hear you
telling me that.

902
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,385
Were you such a great friend?

903
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,751
I never said I was.

904
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,132
There you go.

905
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:07,761
Thank you.

906
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:11,961
Hiya.

907
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:12,962
Who's he?

908
01:02:15,299 --> 01:02:16,778
Who's he think he is?

909
01:02:16,779 --> 01:02:18,768
Probably some bloody gypsy.

910
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,209
Seem like
a Nancy boy in that jacket.

911
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,540
Who's he looking at?

912
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:27,043
Head down, regular circus.

913
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,244
Look who else is coming in.

914
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,087
Where?

915
01:02:29,088 --> 01:02:30,579
Behind you.

916
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,415
Let's have some fun then.

917
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,616
Are you coming?

918
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:39,622
You are an idiot Sean.

919
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:41,933
Who gave birth to that?

920
01:02:41,934 --> 01:02:44,460
Watch me nanny boy's coming.

921
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,566
What's he want then?

922
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:48,064
. Hey Nancy boy.

923
01:02:48,065 --> 01:02:49,135
Maybe he wants to join me.

924
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,329
My head.

925
01:03:35,112 --> 01:03:36,489
I didn't do that.

926
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:41,886
No, it were me
that landed a punch.

927
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,296
I don't remember.

928
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:49,558
I think I was drunk.

929
01:03:50,627 --> 01:03:52,061
Oh you think.

930
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:53,729
If I caused any damage-

931
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,537
- You damaged the pride of
a couple of local laughs

932
01:03:55,538 --> 01:03:56,538
that's all.

933
01:03:58,068 --> 01:04:00,503
I hear you were
defending the honor

934
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,177
of our village idiot.

935
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:08,051
Yeah I think they
were picking on him.

936
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:11,647
Well they paid their dues.

937
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:14,483
But, you didn't
need to start on me

938
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:16,519
when I arrived to
restore the peace.

939
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,520
I'm sorry.

940
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,233
You're the lad that was
asking about the Dutch guy

941
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,859
that shot himself.

942
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,568
Yeah he's a friend of my dad's.

943
01:04:28,665 --> 01:04:31,500
You know my dad's a postmaster.

944
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:34,038
Strange company
for a respectable man

945
01:04:34,039 --> 01:04:36,572
like a postmaster to keep.

946
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,040
Not really.

947
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,415
Vincent generated more
letters than a town,

948
01:04:40,416 --> 01:04:42,947
so it was sort of a
business relationship.

949
01:04:42,948 --> 01:04:46,115
So what business
do you have here'!

950
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:48,117
I have an appointment
with Dr. Gachet

951
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:50,686
to talk about Vincent.

952
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,023
I had me eye on him
right from the start.

953
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:56,459
Don't worry it'll be all right.

954
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,727
I'll have a little look around.

955
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,538
<i>So when I come in on
Monday morning to hear</i>

956
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:04,600
<i>he'd shot himself,
I'm not surprised.</i>

957
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:05,705
You're here.

958
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:09,038
How is Mr. Vincent, any better?

959
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,878
<i>But, he told me
what I wanted to know.</i>

960
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:12,280
It's a bad do,
all this you know.

961
01:05:12,281 --> 01:05:13,878
<i>That he tried to kill himself</i>

962
01:05:13,879 --> 01:05:16,221
<i>and not to let anyone
else gel the blame.</i>

963
01:05:17,547 --> 01:05:20,289
<i>Like I'd blame anyone
else for his crime.</i>

964
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:25,621
I think we should
leave the man in peace.

965
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:28,228
Even caused me trouble
after he were dead.

966
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:31,627
Dr. Mazery kept pestering
me to file his report

967
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:34,897
even though he knew I
already had Gachefs.

968
01:05:34,898 --> 01:05:36,343
Who's Dr. Maury'?

969
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,006
Dr. Malay?

970
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:45,908
' Yes?

971
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:51,580
I would never send
a report normally.

972
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,649
I mean this was Gachefs case.

973
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,418
Then I read that the
patient died two days later

974
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,419
in his room.

975
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:01,636
So I felt that I
should for the record.

976
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:06,295
I asked the patient
how it happened?

977
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,330
He said he had shot himself.

978
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:10,199
But, I knew he hadn't.

979
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,801
<i>I could tell by his wound.</i>

980
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,503
<i>With suicides, people
shoot themselves</i>

981
01:06:14,504 --> 01:06:15,504
in the head.

982
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:20,509
Either in the temple
or through the mouth.

983
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:24,185
If not, then through the heart,
but not through the stomach.

984
01:06:24,186 --> 01:06:25,524
I was suspicious.

985
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:29,218
The bullet wound,
look, stand up.

986
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,286
Stand up.

987
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:31,390
Come on, let me show you.

988
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:32,828
There you are back and forth.

989
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:34,392
That's it, now back like that.

990
01:06:34,393 --> 01:06:36,225
Now you're down there like that,

991
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:37,136
and now look.

992
01:06:37,137 --> 01:06:38,360
You see there.

993
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,898
You see that's too low an angle.

994
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,667
For what?

995
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:45,668
He would've had to
have fired the gun

996
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,736
with his outstretched toe.

997
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,577
Go on you outstretch your toe.

998
01:06:49,578 --> 01:06:50,873
Just stretch your toe out.

999
01:06:50,874 --> 01:06:51,874
You see.

1000
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:57,553
And, in any case if you fire
a bullet point blank range,

1001
01:06:57,554 --> 01:06:59,652
it'll go through the body.

1002
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:03,895
Not always, but in
all probability.

1003
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,257
So if it didn't go
through, then the gun

1004
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,329
must've been further back.

1005
01:07:13,663 --> 01:07:15,006
Like there, bang!

1006
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:19,501
You see?

1007
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:20,502
I see.

1008
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,948
Most likely he was shot.

1009
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:18,494
If it isn't the
Provence pugilist.

1010
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:20,062
Should I be scared?

1011
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:22,765
I thought you didn't
go in for village gossip.

1012
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,766
I don't.

1013
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:26,648
That's why one employs servants.

1014
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:28,737
They get it for you.

1015
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,513
Did you also hear
that your friendly local

1016
01:08:30,514 --> 01:08:33,147
gendarme put me
up for the night?

1017
01:08:34,678 --> 01:08:38,751
So now you're up here
contemplating your future.

1018
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,986
No actually I was
thinking how come you lied

1019
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:46,789
if you've got nothing to hide?

1020
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,997
What makes you
think I have and duty

1021
01:08:48,998 --> 01:08:50,767
to tell you the truth.

1022
01:08:52,262 --> 01:08:54,535
Maybe I just thought my life
was none of your business.

1023
01:08:54,536 --> 01:08:56,477
I wasn't asking about your life.

1024
01:08:56,478 --> 01:08:58,967
I was asking about
Vincent's death.

1025
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:02,347
You thought that his death
and my life were linked?

1026
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:05,445
Yes, bull don't
think that anymore.

1027
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,474
The truth is I'm not important.

1028
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:38,207
He wasn't some
lovelorn teenager.

1029
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,208
I know.

1030
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,390
Did you know he was a genius?

1031
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,193
No, I can't Say that I did.

1032
01:09:52,155 --> 01:09:53,156
Well I did.

1033
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:10,773
It's not finished yet.

1034
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:12,583
Alright, I'll see it later.

1035
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,350
Thank you.

1036
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,088
Finished?

1037
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:18,947
He's still working.

1038
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,616
<i>And, so did my father.</i>

1039
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,857
<i>All his life he has tried
so hard to be an artist.</i>

1040
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:27,926
<i>And, then this gruff awkward
man without any proper training</i>

1041
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:33,201
<i>who'd only been painting a
few years comes barging in</i>

1042
01:10:33,202 --> 01:10:35,870
<i>and rushes off in a couple
of hours what poor father</i>

1043
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:39,438
<i>couldn't dream of
painting in two lifetimes.</i>

1044
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:44,646
My dad would lock himself
away and copy them for hours.

1045
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,247
Father told me I was
distracting Vincent

1046
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,818
from important work.

1047
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,888
Asked if I really
wanted to be responsible

1048
01:10:57,889 --> 01:11:01,460
for preventing masterpieces
from being born?

1049
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,160
And, of course I didn't.

1050
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:08,438
So I started lo not
be in or not he well

1051
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,770
when Vincent called.

1052
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,678
Soon after that,
they had an argument,

1053
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,449
<i>a terrible row.</i>

1054
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:27,156
<i>It wasn't about me, but...</i>

1055
01:11:29,254 --> 01:11:31,631
<i>maybe my withdrawal had soured things.</i>

1056
01:11:35,692 --> 01:11:37,672
The next time my father saw him,

1057
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:40,004
he had a bullet in his belly.

1058
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,439
Are you satisfied now?

1059
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:45,877
You can blame me.

1060
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:48,208
You can blame my father.

1061
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:49,979
You're not to blame.

1062
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,149
You've not part in it.

1063
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,314
He was shot by some boys.

1064
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:02,028
Some boy named Rene Sacretain.

1065
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,053
I'm serious.

1066
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:07,732
I can see that.

1067
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:12,399
Rene': an idiot for sure,
but he's not a murderer.

1068
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,330
An idiot who
drank, who had a gun,

1069
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,867
who walked around
all summer with it

1070
01:12:16,868 --> 01:12:20,369
waving it in people's
faces, who bullied Vincent,

1071
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,317
who was seen with Vincent
on the day of his death,

1072
01:12:23,318 --> 01:12:25,741
and his stuff disappears.

1073
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:30,646
He didn't disappear it himself,
so there must have been

1074
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,147
someone else.

1075
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,388
It must've been.

1076
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,660
So lonely Vincent
resorts to hanging around

1077
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:40,032
with drunken teenagers,
and he gets shot.

1078
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:45,405
Or, he shoots himself in
despair at his lonely life.

1079
01:12:47,597 --> 01:12:49,440
The result is the same.

1080
01:12:50,767 --> 01:12:53,714
Either way, instead
he could've been

1081
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:58,907
at our place painting if
I'd behaved differently,

1082
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,613
if him and my father
hadn't argued.

1083
01:13:00,614 --> 01:13:02,783
But, don't you care
that some bastard

1084
01:13:02,784 --> 01:13:05,453
may have gotten
away with murder?

1085
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:11,753
You want to know so
much about his death,

1086
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:14,462
but what do you
know of his life?

1087
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,705
I know that he
tried hard to prove

1088
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,134
he was good for something.

1089
01:13:24,467 --> 01:13:25,571
Yes, he did.

1090
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:33,642
That's why Hake
flowers to his grave.

1091
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,249
That's all I can do for him now.

1092
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:44,453
He would appreciate the
delicate beauty of their bloom

1093
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:47,560
even each blade of
their grassy stems.

1094
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:55,434
No detail of life was too
small or too humble for him.

1095
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:02,604
He appreciated and loved it all.

1096
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:32,474
Let you out of jail did they?

1097
01:14:32,475 --> 01:14:35,039
On account of my
winning personality.

1098
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,314
It's like trying to out
disgrace your friend Vincent.

1099
01:14:37,315 --> 01:14:38,876
I'm working on it.

1100
01:14:45,882 --> 01:14:48,726
You must be the young man
who's been waiting to see me.

1101
01:14:48,727 --> 01:14:50,318
Armand Roulin.

1102
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,856
Son of the great Joseph
Roulin, giant of the South

1103
01:14:52,857 --> 01:14:55,157
with Dostoevsky': soul.

1104
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,525
What?

1105
01:14:56,526 --> 01:14:58,331
That's what Vincent
called your father.

1106
01:14:58,332 --> 01:14:59,995
He told me all about him.

1107
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:00,872
He did?

1108
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:02,497
Yes, and your mother,

1109
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,069
whose lullaby

1110
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:08,870
could sooth even the souls
of Icelandic fisherman.

1111
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,873
Come now, Armand of the
Roulin clan, take a seat,

1112
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:12,874
be welcome.

1113
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:15,477
Louise, drinks.

1114
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:16,386
What'll you have, wine?

1115
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:17,357
No, thank you.

1116
01:15:17,358 --> 01:15:18,882
I had my fill last night.

1117
01:15:18,883 --> 01:15:20,082
Ah, tea then.

1118
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:21,850
I have just the recipe.

1119
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,764
Louise, you know
the one, chop-chop.

1120
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:28,664
So young man, I hear
you've been making

1121
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:32,728
something oi a name for
yourself these past two days.

1122
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:35,897
Believe me that
wasn't my intention.

1123
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,433
I just wanted to
deliver a letter.

1124
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:42,337
From a dead man lo a
dead man I understand.

1125
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:46,108
Yeah, well I didn't
Know that when I set out.

1126
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:47,679
A guy I met in Paris
thought you might have

1127
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,412
the address for Theo's widow.

1128
01:15:50,413 --> 01:15:52,723
Seems right the family
should have the letter.

1129
01:15:52,724 --> 01:15:55,417
That's what my father reckons.

1130
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,728
Your father sounds
like a responsible man.

1131
01:15:57,729 --> 01:15:59,254
I sympathize.

1132
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:01,633
I have to look after the
health of great artists.

1133
01:16:01,634 --> 01:16:02,958
It is a burden.

1134
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:04,926
They are not peaceful souls.

1135
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,963
I understand because
I am an artist too.

1136
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:10,298
That is why they trust me.

1137
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,768
And, Vincent (rusted you too?

1138
01:16:12,769 --> 01:16:13,873
Yes, he did.

1139
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:18,874
Does it mailer now?

1140
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:21,810
I was hoping you'd tell ma.

1141
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,945
Tell you what exactly?

1142
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:26,922
Vincent wrote to my father
six weeks before he died,

1143
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:28,953
and he said he fell
absolutely calm

1144
01:16:28,954 --> 01:16:31,253
and in a normal slate.

1145
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:33,127
So I came here hoping
you could explain

1146
01:16:33,128 --> 01:16:36,291
how he went from absolutely
calm and in a normal state

1147
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,292
to suicidal.

1148
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:41,299
But, I reckon I know
the answer to that.

1149
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,764
Oh do you now?

1150
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,801
You're familiar with
melancholia are you?

1151
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:47,469
I wouldn't say so.

1152
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,575
Sufferers can change
from feeling life

1153
01:16:49,576 --> 01:16:52,674
is a wondrous joy to
being stuck in a pit

1154
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:55,677
of despair within six hours.

1155
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:59,447
So think what changes are
possible within six weeks.

1156
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,950
But, I don't reckon that's it.

1157
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,486
Ravoux girl said
he was happy here.

1158
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:08,190
She's obviously qualified
to make such a diagnosis.

1159
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:10,501
She saw him everyday,
said he was calm

1160
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:12,027
and seemed normal.

1161
01:17:12,028 --> 01:17:14,702
Maybe he did seem that
way, maybe he was that way

1162
01:17:14,703 --> 01:17:16,198
in the beginning.

1163
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,109
There he is.

1164
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,533
He's arrived.

1165
01:17:18,534 --> 01:17:20,343
<i>Leaving the asylum had
given him fresh hope.</i>

1166
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,441
<i>He didn't want for
much just his work</i>

1167
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:23,872
<i>from day to day.</i>

1168
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:24,873
It's good to meet you.

1169
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:25,943
<i>Find a little friendship.</i>

1170
01:17:25,944 --> 01:17:27,649
I've heard so much about you.

1171
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,951
All will be well.

1172
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:33,348
And, did he find
a little friendship?

1173
01:17:33,349 --> 01:17:35,684
He had it from me.

1174
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:39,223
His friend Tanguy said
his star was finally rising.

1175
01:17:39,224 --> 01:17:40,822
And, it was.

1176
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:44,359
With each new canvass, he
painted a shining star.

1177
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,001
But, all of those stars were
surrounded by unfathomable,

1178
01:17:48,002 --> 01:17:49,831
empty loneliness.

1179
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:52,870
You said he had your friendship
and his brother's love.

1180
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:55,042
I mean it seems like
everything was all right.

1181
01:17:55,043 --> 01:17:59,040
Underneath he was deeply
afraid of the future.

1182
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:00,375
To the baby, yes.

1183
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:02,151
Of his own and Theo's.

1184
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:07,991
Time to meet you little boy.

1185
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:17,192
I don't think he's
responding to your medicine.

1186
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,264
<i>He knew that Theo had spent</i>

1187
01:18:19,265 --> 01:18:21,105
<i>a small fortune on him.</i>

1188
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:28,611
<i>The knowledge oi this
tore into Vincent.</i>

1189
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,373
Excuse me.

1190
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,683
<i>Theo could've
had a house like this</i>

1191
01:18:35,684 --> 01:18:38,682
<i>with all the money he'd spent
on Vincent over the years.</i>

1192
01:18:38,683 --> 01:18:43,418
<i>But, instead what did he have
for his new wife and baby'!</i>

1193
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:47,526
<i>Rooms full of paintings
that no one wanted to buy.</i>

1194
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:58,266
<i>Vincent's biggest fear
was that the burden of him</i>

1195
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,645
<i>would bring down his brother.</i>

1196
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:07,247
So Vincent worried
a little about money.

1197
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:10,779
It's not like they
were starving is it?

1198
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:14,284
Listen I don't reckon
he committed suicide.

1199
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:18,320
I reckon he was shot.

1200
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,895
Have you been talking to Mazery?

1201
01:19:21,896 --> 01:19:24,269
You heard his tale of how
the angle of the bullet

1202
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:28,563
was all wrong, that nobody shoots
themselves in the stomach?

1203
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:30,265
Well yeah.

1204
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:33,635
What's to stop Vincent from
doing something improbable?

1205
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:35,445
I mean cutting a piece of
your ear off and making

1206
01:19:35,446 --> 01:19:38,442
a present of it to a whore
is hardly probable now is it?

1207
01:19:38,443 --> 01:19:40,477
But, there was this
lad Rene who had a gun,

1208
01:19:40,478 --> 01:19:42,850
who bullied Vincent and was
seen with him on that day.

1209
01:19:42,851 --> 01:19:45,517
I was at Vincent's
bedside on that day,

1210
01:19:45,518 --> 01:19:48,016
and he said he had shot
himself and told me

1211
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:49,651
not to blame anyone.

1212
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:50,919
Not to blame anyone?

1213
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,422
Doesn't that sound
to you like he was

1214
01:19:52,423 --> 01:19:53,695
trying to cover for someone?

1215
01:19:53,696 --> 01:19:55,957
He wanted to die I know that.

1216
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,696
Why would he say
there's no one to blame

1217
01:19:57,697 --> 01:19:59,673
unless he thought
someone might be blamed?

1218
01:19:59,674 --> 01:20:03,371
He said that because
there was someone, me.

1219
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,333
I think he

1220
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,012
took his life to
try and save Theo

1221
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,289
because of something I'd said.

1222
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:22,183
You see there was an
argument, and I said

1223
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,355
<i>something to Vincent
that as his doctor</i>

1224
01:20:24,356 --> 01:20:25,798
<i>I should never have said.</i>

1225
01:20:25,799 --> 01:20:28,056
<i>But, he'd made me so angry.</i>

1226
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,524
You know nothing about art!

1227
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:30,970
<i>He called me an artistic fraud.</i>

1228
01:20:30,971 --> 01:20:32,337
And, you are lying
especially lo yourself.

1229
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,361
<i>In a way I am.</i>

1230
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:34,996
You are an artistic fraud.

1231
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,533
<i>I desperately wanted
to be an artist,</i>

1232
01:20:36,534 --> 01:20:38,068
<i>but my father made
me study medicine,</i>

1233
01:20:38,069 --> 01:20:40,502
<i>and I failed to stand up to him.</i>

1234
01:20:40,503 --> 01:20:43,872
<i>Vincent said I was living
a lie whilst he lived</i>

1235
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:46,908
and struggled for the truth.

1236
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:50,322
So I thought in the heat of
our argument, okay Vincent

1237
01:20:50,323 --> 01:20:53,681
I'll give you your
precious truth.

1238
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:57,425
I knew that Theo was in the
tertiary stages of syphilis,

1239
01:20:57,426 --> 01:21:00,688
any stress financial,
emotional or physical

1240
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,827
could kill him.

1241
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:09,030
I said to Vincent,
"What do you think

1242
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,704
"the burden of
worrying about you

1243
01:21:10,705 --> 01:21:12,734
"is doing to your brother?"

1244
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:15,036
It's quite likely killing him.

1245
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:17,210
That is the price of
your truth, the price

1246
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:19,240
of your path as an artist.

1247
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:20,447
Is it worth it?

1248
01:21:21,444 --> 01:21:23,947
<i>That stopped the argument dead.</i>

1249
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,115
Vincent?

1250
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,051
Vincent!

1251
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:33,265
Vincent come back!

1252
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,458
Vincent!

1253
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:42,870
Two weeks later, I am
sitting at his bedside,

1254
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,574
and he is dying.

1255
01:21:47,603 --> 01:21:52,474
The only words he said, "Maybe
it is better for everyone."

1256
01:23:14,056 --> 01:23:16,229
Here a letter for a letter.

1257
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,705
Theo's widow is collecting
all his letters.

1258
01:23:20,706 --> 01:23:22,463
She wants to publish them.

1259
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:24,740
I'll make sure she gets that.

1260
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,426
In reading through
Vincent's letters to Theo,

1261
01:23:41,427 --> 01:23:43,551
she came across this one.

1262
01:23:43,552 --> 01:23:45,691
It moved her so much,
she copied it out

1263
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:47,099
and sent it to me.

1264
01:23:50,326 --> 01:23:52,527
Why are you giving it to me?

1265
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:53,871
It is from when
he was starting out

1266
01:23:53,872 --> 01:23:56,698
on his journey as an artist.

1267
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,679
Take it for your journey.

1268
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,242
Thank you Dr. Gachet.

1269
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:10,452
Armand Roulin, good luck.

1270
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:20,555
Thanks a lot.

1271
01:24:20,556 --> 01:24:22,390
No bother sir.

1272
01:24:30,466 --> 01:24:34,573
<i>Who am
I in the eyes of most people?</i>

1273
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:39,546
<i>A nobody, a non entity,
an unpleasant person.</i>

1274
01:24:42,945 --> 01:24:46,648
<i>Someone who has not,
and never will have</i>

1275
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:49,150
<i>any position in society.</i>

1276
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:51,757
<i>In short, the lowest of the low.</i>

1277
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,106
<i>Well then even if that
were all absolutely true,</i>

1278
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:05,835
<i>then one day I will
have to show by my work</i>

1279
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:11,010
<i>what this nobody, this non
entity has in his heart.</i>

1280
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,589
I looked for you at the bar.

1281
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,661
Any luck on the job from?

1282
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:33,795
Nothing.

1283
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:37,767
Lieutenant Milliet
says I should enlist.

1284
01:25:37,768 --> 01:25:39,167
What for?

1285
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:42,274
Well I'm good at
fighting, aren't I?

1286
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,309
Roulin's have always been that.

1287
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:52,053
The trick is to know
what you're fighting for.

1288
01:25:54,817 --> 01:25:56,784
Would you look at it?

1289
01:25:56,785 --> 01:25:59,732
There's a whole
other world up there.

1290
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:05,067
Something we get to gaze upon
but don't fully understand.

1291
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:08,532
It reminds me of him.

1292
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,043
It feels wrong all
that life snuffed out

1293
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,382
because of a stupid accident.

1294
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:25,012
I'm still wondering why he
would cover for those boys.

1295
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,686
What I'm wondering is if people

1296
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:28,923
will appreciate what he did.

1297
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,102
You were looking for me?

1298
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,765
This arrived from
Holland this morning.

1299
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:45,939
It's from Jo, Theo's widow.

1300
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:50,745
It turns out Gachel
did send the letter.

1301
01:26:54,009 --> 01:26:57,752
And, she was terribly
touched by what you did.

1302
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,715
She thought it only right
that you should know

1303
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:04,852
what was in it, so she
copied it out for us.

1304
01:27:04,853 --> 01:27:08,022
She sends her, she
said something about-

1305
01:27:08,023 --> 01:27:09,934
Alright, give it here.

1306
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,738
<i>In the life of the painter,</i>

1307
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:22,603
<i>death may perhaps not be
the most difficult thing.</i>

1308
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:27,475
<i>For myself, I declare I
don't Know anything about it.</i>

1309
01:27:27,476 --> 01:27:32,213
<i>But, the sight of the stars
always makes me dream.</i>

1310
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:35,252
<i>Why I say to myself should
those spots of light</i>

1311
01:27:35,253 --> 01:27:38,619
<i>in the firmament bet
Inaccessible lo us?</i>

1312
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,794
<i>Maybe we can take
death to go to a star</i>

1313
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:45,927
<i>and lo die peacefully of
old age would be to go there</i>

1314
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:46,928
<i>on foot.</i>

1315
01:27:49,465 --> 01:27:51,638
<i>For the moment, I'm
going to go to bed</i>

1316
01:27:51,639 --> 01:27:56,637
<i>because it's late, and I wish
you goodnight and good luck</i>

1317
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:59,744
<i>with a handshake,
your loving Vincent.</i>
