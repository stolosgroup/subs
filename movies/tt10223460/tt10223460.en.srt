00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,592
-She had the idea for...
-Yeah.

631
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,719
What if we offered you $10,000?

632
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,096
No. No, no, no. Wrong approach.

633
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,932
Offer him, like, a fundraiser.

634
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,266
He'll go for that.

635
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,686
Oh... Hi. I'm sorry. Are you two...

636
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,063
Ew. Gross. No.

637
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,440
Parker Debs, guidance counselor.
Same school.

638
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,193
How about, uh,
we host a fundraiser for your math club?

639
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,986
Don't answer that. Okay.

640
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,782
What about if it's, like,
instead of three months, it's six months,

641
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,910
and it could be,
like, a whole math wing?

642
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,912
I'm thinking about the children.

643
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,622
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

644
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,251
I don't think anyone's gonna believe
that she's gonna go from Bastian to me.

645
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,836
-That's a good point.
-Well, the fact is

646
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,838
that she did go
from Bastian to you.

647
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:57,089
Counterpoint.

648
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,924
We're not pretending you're in love.

649
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,551
We're just gonna say
that you're getting

650
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,052
to know each other,
and if it goes further,

651
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,303
then great, and if it doesn't...

652
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,805
It won't. Come...

653
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,474
-Not with that attitude.
-Well, then it doesn't have to.

654
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,310
This is about this moment.

655
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:13,814
Managing the media
frenzy until things die down.

656
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,399
I have a daughter.

657
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,026
I don't want
to drag her into the middle of a circus.

658
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,155
I can assure you, we won't impinge
on your life whatsoever.

659
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,616
How does it feel
to not be a nobody?

660
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,910
How do you feel about her being so much
hotter than you, Charlie?

661
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,161
Hey, Charlie! Right here!

662
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,205
Hey, Charlie, are you gonna go through
with this? Where's the honeymoon?

663
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,957
Did you get
a good look at him?

664
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,584
Yeah. He's cute.

665
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,002
What?

666
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,753
-He's fine.
-COLLIN: Hey.

667
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,547
Charlie, come in.

668
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,425
Oh, she's right there. Jesus.

669
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,510
Come over, guys.

670
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,262
Charlie, Kat. Kat, Charlie.

671
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,680
-Hi. Oh.
-How are you? Oh.

672
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,056
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

673
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,851
-Okay. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-I'm Parker.

674
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,645
I'm... I am the one
who brought Charlie to the concert,

675
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,813
-so I'm...
-CHARLIE: Yep. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

676
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,274
Basically, I guess
I'm responsible for this whole thing.

677
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,193
Hi, Parker.

678
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:00,277
Hey, Kat.

679
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,486
Hi.

680
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,155
Would you do me a favor,

681
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,032
uh, just two seconds,
and just say,

682
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,617
"Roxy, you really blew it"?

683
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,161
<i>Today Show</i> is a go
at 10:00 on Tuesday.

684
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,038
-Sorry.
-They want...

685
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,164
Charlie.

686
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,751
Charlie in studio
and Kat remote from London.

687
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:16,835
-Kat.
-Excuse me one second.

688
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,504
-I just have to take a call.
-Okay.

689
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,130
-Bye, Kat.
-Everything's set up...

690
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:22,341
-She's like a real person.
-All right, so what's going on?

691
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,051
Oh, we're booking
interviews all week.

692
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,636
Uh-huh. I thought
that's what today was.

693
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,596
No, no. Today's more
of a press conference.

694
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,390
But throughout the next few weeks,
we're gonna have some sit-downs and B-roll

695
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,309
and news outlets following us,
charting the progress

696
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,936
as you two get to know each other.

697
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,062
It's all in your email.

698
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,313
I don't check my emails a lot.

699
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,774
How do you schedule your life
if you don't check your email?

700
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,734
Easy. I can't do anything

701
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,403
between 8:00 and 3:00
Monday through Friday,

702
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:44,988
and I have math club after school,

703
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,573
and three days a week,
I have my kid.

704
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,742
Beyond that,
I'm pretty much available.

705
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,078
-So, sorry...
-Melissa.

706
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,247
Melissa, you're gonna
have to move <i>The Today Show.</i>

707
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,414
What? Excuse me?

708
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,083
We don't move <i>The Today Show.</i>

709
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,585
We move for <i>The Today Show.</i>

710
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,170
-He's gonna have to shift his schedule.
-Okay, I'll handle it.

711
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,256
Okay, I can handle my own life.

712
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,007
I can help him handle it.

713
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,343
Uh, Melissa,
shouldn't you be posting Vitamix?

714
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,678
That's Tyra's job.

715
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,681
Oh. Right.

716
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:11,974
Morning, everybody.
I don't know about you guys,

717
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,101
but when I get up in the morning,
I like to meditate.

718
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,311
I also love to have fresh juice.

719
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:19,273
So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix.

720
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,359
I take my fresh greens, mix and go.

721
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,986
Okay, look, I hate
to interrupt an artist

722
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,113
while she's juicing,
but we're gonna have to draw

723
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,906
a hard line when it comes
to the students

724
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,117
-and the schedule, okay?
-Yeah.

725
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,451
You're a little shiny.

726
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,954
Awesome. Let's take a selfie.

727
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,623
I don't feel comfortable.

728
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,834
-I really don't feel this is my world.
-It's natural.

729
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:42,462
It just feels like everyone walking around
is, like, a sycophant.

730
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:45,174
Everything in her life is sponsored.

731
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,301
-I know, but don't ruin this for me.
-No, but listen to me.

732
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,303
-I...
-COLLIN: Hey.

733
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,263
-How we doing?
-I'm sorry.

734
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,348
I don't... I don't think
it's gonna work out.

735
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,433
It's just perspective.

736
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,809
No, it's not just perspective.

737
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,978
You see her as some pop star
with endorsement deals,

738
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,897
a narcissist who takes
meaningless selfies,

739
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,023
but that's not the full...

740
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,858
Well, I mean, is a selfie
ever meaningful? I mean...

741
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:03,942
Look up.

742
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,863
Look, I don't mean to be negative,
but I'm not a big social media person.

743
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,781
I feel it's kind of a distorted reality.

744
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,867
I'm so glad I came to your TED Talk.

745
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,703
No, come on. I see it
all the time in my students.

746
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,954
-It's...
-WOMAN: Kat's ready to walk.

747
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,039
Okay, she's ready.

748
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,750
COLLIN: Social media
can also reach people.

749
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,376
-No, I know. Yeah.
-It can be a tool.

750
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,794
You know what a tool is,
though, right, Charlie?

751
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:25,255
-Okay. Thank you, Melissa.
-PARKER: Burn.

752
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,842
I know this is a lot.

753
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,802
Just go out there
and be yourself.

754
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,180
Myself probably
wouldn't be here, but...

755
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,681
Listen, if you don't
want to do this...

756
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,392
Uh... What, then I leave?

757
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:39,603
I thought you said he was into this.

758
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,688
-COLLIN: He is.
-He can hear you.

759
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kat Valdez and her new husband,

760
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,318
Charlie Gilbert.

761
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:47,903
(APPLAUSE)

762
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,202
So, you think it's romantic
marrying a complete stranger?

763
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,121
Uh, impulsive, without a plan.

764
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,708
-But, hey, look where my plans got me.
-(LAUGHING)

765
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,210
So, you just

766
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:04,628
threw caution to the wind
and thought...

767
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,547
{\an8}I didn't think, actually.

768
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,965
It was a moment.

769
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,842
You're banking a lifetime on a moment?

770
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,302
No, I'm banking a moment on a moment.

771
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,471
Get enough of those,
and that's a lifetime.

772
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,348
You know nothing about each other.

773
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,891
Did you think twice?

774
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:18,976
Charlie?

775
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,811
People meet randomly
all the time.

776
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,896
At a... At a bar or...

777
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,981
Online.

778
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,315
Yeah, online, at 7-Eleven.

779
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,025
(LAUGHING)

780
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,862
I mean, why is this any crazier?

781
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,447
To state the obvious, you got married.

782
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,994
Yeah, and...

783
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,705
Now we get to know each other.

784
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:42,456
-But not as man and wife?
-KAT: No.

(ALL LAUGHING)

00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,844
Last night, I held up a friend's sign
asking a woman to marry me,

790
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:57,931
and she said, yes,
and I did, and...

00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,145
you know, I did it not, you know,
because she was beautiful...

-Well, maybe a little...

in the moment, the right thing to do.

00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,739
So, what, you just saw
each other and said, yes?

And that doesn't seem frivolous?

797
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,001
Historically, marriage was transactional.

798
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,378
It was about expanding your empire,

799
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:31,590
and a woman's value
was based on what she brought.

and I'll give you my daughter."

But it really was a business deal,

and it wasn't designed
to be about love,

00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,978
Get off the live, Mel.

941
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,313
All right.

942
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:22,191
So, we just need a little bit more
B-roll for <i>The Today Show.</i>

943
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,776
Well, I've got to get home to Tank.

944
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,361
-Is Tank his daughter?
-Stop.

945
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,071
-Okay.
-You have to go?

946
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,240
Yeah, if you guys are done with me.

947
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,701
Mm-hmm. We're going to a party.

948
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,286
You go.

949
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,164
Where's home?

950
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,171
KAT: Wow. Cool.

951
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,380
Thanks.

952
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,759
Yeah, it's a...

953
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,845
Kat, meet dog.

954
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:53,722
Wow, I never heard
that one before.

955
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:57,017
Sorry. That was pretty... ruff.

956
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,602
(LAUGHS)

957
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,772
You are so lucky
that Mel didn't hear you say that.

958
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,315
No, I'm lucky Mel isn't here.

959
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,484
I feel like you're never alone.

960
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,069
What? I'm alone now.

961
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,197
Well, I mean, yeah, other than Kofi.

962
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,782
KAT: Just ignore him.

963
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:14,368
CHARLIE: Is everything you do filmed?

964
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:16,662
-KAT: Banked.
-Banked?

965
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,121
For my channel.

966
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,415
Just little mini episodes of life.

967
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,169
Uh...

968
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,754
Can we skip an episode?

969
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,844
-Want me to go?
-KAT: Yeah, you can go.

970
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,762
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-KOFI: Goodnight. I'll see you.

971
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:35,097
Happy?

972
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,181
Relieved.

973
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:38,934
Is this your daughter?

974
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,477
CHARLIE: Yeah.
KAT: She's cute.

975
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,771
Thanks. Yeah, she's great.

976
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:46,233
Although she is
in that awkward in-between phase

977
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:47,943
where she's still my baby girl,

978
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:51,446
but she definitely
wants nothing to do with me.

979
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,407
And you can forget
about getting hugs,

980
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,826
'cause it's not happening anymore,

981
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,619
which kind of breaks my heart,

982
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,080
but that's the way it goes.

983
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,332
What happened with her mom?

984
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,794
I mean, I'm sorry, you don't...

985
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,045
You know, it's none of my business.

986
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,297
You don't have to tell me.

987
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,465
No, it's okay. Um...

988
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,261
We were married,
and we actually had a good marriage.

989
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,554
You know, then,

990
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,181
I don't know,
all of a sudden, I got the feeling

991
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,558
she didn't want it
or she didn't want me anymore,

992
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,102
and I had nothing
to do but let her go.

993
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:25,063
And, you know,
statistically, we're screwed,

994
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:29,067
'cause 48% of marriages
end in divorce, so...

995
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,944
That means 52% work.

996
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,654
Ah, an optimist.

997
00:43:32,738 --> 00:43:33,822
(KAT CHUCKLES)

998
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,991
-This is so cool. Can I?
-Yeah.

999
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,369
And then I think when you get up to,
like, second and third,

1000
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:41,538
then it jumps up to,
like, 67% failure rate.

1001
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,707
Even if it's one in a billion,

1002
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,043
what does it matter?
It's worth a shot.

1003
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,795
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1004
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,130
I believe in marriage.

1005
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,256
Jesus, still?

1006
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,592
Haven't you been
married like six times?

1007
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:54,843
Three times.

1008
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,054
Not including this. This is four.

1009
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,307
But the first time
was only 48 hours, so...

1010
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,184
doesn't count.

1011
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,311
But still, do you ever
feel like just kind of,

1012
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:07,314
"I'm waving the white flag
on marriage. That's it."

1013
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,941
No, it's like math.

1014
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,236
When you get a problem wrong,
you just don't give up on it.

1015
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,989
You keep trying till you get it right.

1016
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,366
CHARLIE: <i>And what about
you and Bastian?</i>

1017
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,992
How long were
you guys together?

1018
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:20,953
Mm. Year and a half.

1019
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,664
I'd just split
from my second husband.

1020
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,749
He was a music producer
who did, uh,

1021
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:29,086
my last two albums
and then sold a sex tape.

1022
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,296
-(SUCKING TEETH)
-That's not the worst part.

1023
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,882
The worst part is
I thought I could fix things.

1024
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:36,343
Pretty hard to fix a sex tape.

1025
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,053
Right.

1026
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,018
Sorry. Yeah,
it's just a little power nap.

1027
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,437
-Pacing himself.
-Hmm.

1028
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,607
If we give him a minute,
he'll... he'll restart.

1029
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,026
-Okay.
-But you were saying?

1030
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,611
Well, this business,
those type of guys,

1031
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,405
they build you up
to break you down.

1032
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:57,990
But you were
already famous, so...

1033
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,700
It's not about fame.

1034
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,619
You know, it's about credibility.

1035
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,747
It just didn't matter
how successful I was.

1036
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,500
They never gave it to me.

1037
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,670
You know, I've never been
nominated for anything?

1038
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,715
And then I met Bastian.

1039
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:16,758
And he...

1040
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:18,719
And he gave me this.

1041
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,932
"Sing." What does that mean?

1042
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:26,268
It means "Don't let them win."

1043
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:32,900
Nobody's all bad, Charlie.

1044
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,194
If they were, it would
make it so much easier.

1045
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,447
But cheating on you with
your assistant is pretty bad.

What was your old favorite song?

I don't know, this might be

a little too edgy for you to handle,

but when my mom was sick,
we watched a lot of musicals,

instead of saying,
"I want to be with you,"

some good times together.

questioned a few things.

1574
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,426

1575
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:39,763

with having help.

I'm helpless.

a lot of things on my plate.

as many people helping you

be alone right now.

not alone without me.

-I'm serious.

01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:31,009
I can't. Turn it off.

Are you at some point
gonna be fun again?

2032
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:34,304
I was never fun.

2033

That's true, and I love you anyway.

you're not always gonna feel this way.

2035
01:32:39,142 --> 01:32:41,353
You're lucky you made it.
We were gonna leave without you.

2040
01:32:51,947 --> 01:32:54,116
Is it okay if I ask you that?

2041
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:56,326
Yeah.

2042
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,619
Um, sure.

01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:00,122
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

He seems like the sweetest man.

2045
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,792
You know, I actually DMed him

2046
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:06,378
to wish him luck
on his Mathalon tomorrow.

2047

2058
01:33:30,527 --> 01:33:32,446
we should get right down to it.

2059
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:35,115
I mean, we all know
that you guys are not "together,"

2060

uh, yet you wrote

Uh, Bastian wrote <i>Segundo</i> for Kat.

01:46:46,281 --> 01:46:47,908
Who meets at 4:00 p.m.?

2336
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:50,869
When we met, he was in a unitard.

2337
01:46:51,578 --> 01:46:53,205
She liked what she saw.

2338
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:54,414
(LAUGHS)

2339
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:57,751
Eighty-one years ago,
we were born in the same hospital

2340
01:46:57,835 --> 01:47:00,754
two days apart, in diapers.

2341
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:03,173
Here it is 81 years later,

2342
01:47:03,257 --> 01:47:05,133
and we're back in diapers again.

2343
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:07,302
Oh, Charlie! (LAUGHS)

2344
01:47:07,427 --> 01:47:09,429
We met on a dating app, but then,

2345
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:11,431
uh, he invited me on the second date,

2346
01:47:11,515 --> 01:47:13,767
um, camping in the woods,
and I was like,

2347
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:15,894
"That seems unsafe...

2348
01:47:15,978 --> 01:47:17,271
-"so I'll go."
-Her friend told her not to go.

2349
01:47:17,354 --> 01:47:19,857
Yeah, but she did,
and it's been five years,

2350
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,401
-and she's still alive.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

2351
01:47:23,193 --> 01:47:24,236
BOTH: We met at a concert.

2352
