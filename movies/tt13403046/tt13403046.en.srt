3
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,544
What?

4
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,103
<i>Girl, fuck that. Just leave.</i>

5
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,521
I know. Like...

6
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,316
I obviously don't mind paying,

7
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,817
but what a weird way
to start off a date.

8
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,152
<i>That's what I'm sayin'.</i>

9
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>Is this what you tell your kids?</i>

10
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,615
<i>"Oh, it was so romantic
before our first date, y'all.</i>

11
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,993
<i>"He texted me, 'FYI,
this place is cash only.'"</i>

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,703
<i>No.</i>

13
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,664
I'm already here.

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,874
<i>Girl...</i>

15
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,667
I'm really fuckin' hungry.

16
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>Mmm.</i>

17
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,379
I don't know. Hopefully,
it'll make for a good story.

18
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,840
<i>Call me after.</i>

19
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,134
- <i>Love you.</i>
- Okay, I love you more.

20
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,302
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

21
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,803
Bye-bye.

22
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,263
<i>Bye!</i>

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,351
Okay, let's do this.

24
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,606
So I love hot sauce.

25
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,941
I literally just put it
on every single thing

26
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,735
I can find around the house sometimes.

27
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,196
From pizza to chicken wings.

28
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,240
Even though it gives me
terrible acid reflux.

29
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,909
- Mmm.
- It makes its way up to my throat

30
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,869
and I literally feel like
I'm gonna vomit.

31
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,164
- So...
- Oh, yeah. That, um, sucks.

32
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,208
- Mmm.
- But I love it, so...

33
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,126
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,088
Like, I love wasabi, but, um,

35
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,215
Mexican spices
would be too much for me.

36
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,301
- Mmm. Yeah. I get that.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,803
Yeah.

38
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,684
Mmm.

39
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,771
What?

40
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:10,440
I had this crazy thought. I...

41
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,150
I just feel like...

42
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,820
the women
in our parents' generation,

43
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,907
they just cared more
about how they dressed

44
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,076
and just, kind of, how they looked.

45
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,495
They were more into femininity.

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,080
- You know what I mean?
- Mmm.

47
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,416
Like, nowadays, I feel like girls,
they just wear

48
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,876
oversized everything,
like it's a blanket.

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,003
Do you know what I mean?
You know what I'm saying, right?

50
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,338
- Um...
- It's like...

51
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,216
'Cause I think you would
just look great in a dress.

52
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,052
Not that you don't look good
in a sweater,

53
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,721
- but I mean, if you were...
- You guys okay?

54
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,266
Uh, yeah. Um, pretty much
done, actually. Thank you.

55
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,018
Cool. Yeah, we'll just
get this wrapped up then.

56
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,354
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,565
Oh, did you bring cash?

58
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,317
Yeah. You reminded me, so...

59
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,529
My brother is coming into town.

60
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,906
If it's cool, I'm just gonna
snag these leftovers

61
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,033
and, uh, I guess
I'll just let you leave...

62
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,160
Cool. No. Yeah.

63
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,287
...a couple bucks less
on the tip.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,580
If that makes sense.

65
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,751
Your scarf is dipping
into the noodles.

66
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,627
Oh, fuck!

67
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,754
Shit!

68
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,340
I love this scarf. Um...

69
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,384
Excuse me? Excuse me.

70
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,802
Quick, come.

71
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,222
Hi, do you have sparkling water?

72
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,807
- Sparkling.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

73
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,768
- Bubble. You know bubbles?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,978
And a lemon, please?

75
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,564
I don't know if she understood
what I said.

76
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,732
I don't think she speaks English.

77
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,745
That was, uh, that was fun.

78
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,997
You're really cute.

79
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,957
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,585
We should do this again sometime.

81
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,505
Yeah, look, Chad, um...

82
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,632
Yeah.

83
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,592
Oh. I... I don't

84
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,553
think we're really a match.
You know?

85
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,805
Wow.

86
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,598
I was literally just being polite.

87
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,850
You're not even my type,
to be honest, so...

88
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,727
Okay.

89
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,772
Oh, that's funny?
"Ha-ha, it's hilarious"? Yeah.

90
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,733
Okay. Good luck finding a guy,
you stuck-up bitch.

91
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,403
Um...

92
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,786
What the fuck.

93
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,657
Oh, fuck.

94
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,166
Oh. Stupid idiot.

95
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,003
<i>Can you please
just text him and write,</i>

96
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,381
"Fuck you and your
ugly-ass scarf, bitch."

97
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,009
Oh, see, I wish I thought
of that in the moment.

98
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,177
Instead I just stood there like an idiot.

99
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,804
- Let's switch.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,806
I don't know how you do it, Mollie.

101
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,516
Do what?

102
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,934
Dating people.

103
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,770
And I always end up alone.

104
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,190
Which, by the way,
I'm very okay with.

105
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,776
No, no. What?

106
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,906
You do not need a man, okay?
Or anybody, for that matter.

107
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:50,076
It's just the way we've been raised
since fuckin' Disney movies.

108
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,287
- Yeah. Fuck Ariel.
- Fuck her.

109
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,497
Stupid bitch left the whole sea for a man.

110
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,707
Come on, now.

111
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,250
Like, fuck... Fuck Beauty.

112
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,294
Yeah, fuck the Beast.
I am the beast.

113
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,796
You are the beast! Get it!

114
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,134
Time, everyone!

115
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,137
Whoo! Great job today, huh?

116
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,639
I mean that.

117
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,891
Now give yourselves a round of applause.

118
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,935
Whoo!

119
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,061
Great job!

120
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,521
- Bam!
- Ah!

121
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,732
- You are powerful!
- You are powerful!

122
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,651
- Look at how strong you are.
- Look at this.

123
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,148
Oh, fuck.

124
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,063
Have you ever had these?

125
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,318
Grapes?

126
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,987
No. Cotton Candy grapes.

127
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,156
They taste just like them.
I'm not kiddin'.

128
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,783
- Really?
- Yeah.

129
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,367
I told my sister and niece.

130
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,660
They were like,
"No way, fuck you."

131
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,537
So now I'm getting them
on my way there.

132
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,122
Your niece said, "Fuck you"?

133
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,750
Yeah. Four-year-olds are crazy.

134
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,170
All right.

135
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,130
I can tell you don't believe me,

136
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,132
so you're gonna have to try one.

137
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,343
I don't want you leaving here
thinking I'm a weirdo.

138
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,348
Okay.

139
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,231
- Right?
- Holy shit. Mmm.

140
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,775
- Wow.
- Science.

141
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,653
Yeah. Go science.

142
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,446
Do you live around here?

143
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,699
'Cause I live on aisle six.

144
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,618
I just come to the fruit section

145
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,870
to talk to random,
very good-looking people

146
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,413
that stand near it.

147
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,458
That was terrible.

148
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,127
That was kinda terrible.

149
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,295
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

150
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,547
Have a good night.

151
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,423
Okay. You, too.

152
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,222
You know what? Fuck it.

153
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,142
I'm already ruining this,
so I'm just gonna keep goin'.

154
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,978
Do you think
I could have your number?

155
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,605
- Oh.
- It's really just so I have a story

156
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,357
for my sister and my niece
when I see them.

157
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,651
Because I think we're
gonna talk about the grapes.

158
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,319
Oh, of course. Yeah.

159
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,405
Then I can tell them
that I met someone else

160
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,657
who feels the same way.

161
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,242
Sure. Makes sense, yeah.

162
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,035
Okay.

163
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,166
We can meet here next week
to talk about the broccoli if you want.

164
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,667
Sounds good.

165
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,837
Oh.

166
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,381
- Mist.
- Rain forest.

167
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,093
Always good to have a little mist, Noa.

168
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,636
- Yes, mystery.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,305
I'm Steve.

170
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,057
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too.

171
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,768
I'm not gonna text you,
but I'll really want to.

172
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,938
Good night.

173
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,148
Good night.

174
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,069
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

175
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,487
- <i>Your number?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

176
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,198
- <i>In a grocery store?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

177
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,699
- <i>The other night?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

178
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,409
<i>And you're just now
telling me today?</i>

179
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,702
<i>Wow.</i>

180
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,078
When you think you had a friend.

181
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,164
No, I just think it was weird,
you know? He was...

182
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,251
He was cute and funny and...

183
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,336
Mmm. Okay.

184
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,631
I didn't think people met people
in real life anymore, you know?

185
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,091
He's probably married.

186
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,135
Thank you for that.
Yes, he's probably married.

187
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,386
Probably.

188
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,347
Like, I'm already thinking
about the fact

189
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,057
- he hasn't texted.
- Mmm.

190
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,768
That's one of the things
I love about dating women.

191
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,647
Less games, more emotional dependence,
you know?

192
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,025
So don't play the games,

193
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,402
just be you straight out the gate.
Fuck it.

194
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,487
Maybe.

195
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,073
Hey, do you want to come over later?

196
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,492
- I could use some emotional dependence.
- Aww.

197
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,328
Well, my emotional dependence
ain't cheap, boo.

198
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,038
Let me tell you.

199
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,101
- Hi.
- Hey!

200
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,937
How you doin'?

201
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,690
- Good, thanks. How are you?
- Good. Good.

202
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,692
This place is really nice.

203
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,568
- Yeah.
- The bears are, you know...

204
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,572
Yeah. It's like the perfect amount
of, you know, grimy, but hip.

205
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,657
Exactly.

206
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,619
- You guys know what you want?
- Hi. Um...

207
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,332
Can I get a Manhattan with, like,
as many cherries as you can spare, please?

208
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,960
- Cherries. I like that.
- I love cherries.

209
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,837
Yeah. I'll do
one more of these, thank you.

210
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,005
Copy.

211
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,756
Here you go. Here.

212
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,383
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

213
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,759
Ay-yo.

214
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,430
- Hi.
- Hey.

215
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,556
- I'm Steve.
- Oh.

216
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,932
Noa.

217
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,058
Um...

218
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,687
All right, so, uh...
Here come the dumb questions.

219
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,105
Where are you from?

220
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,025
Um,
I'm from the East Coast originally,

221
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,151
- yeah.
- Nice.

222
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,402
What about you?

223
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,487
- I'm from Texas. Yeah.
- Oh. Cool.

224
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,864
What brought you out here?

225
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,490
My second residency.

226
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,492
- Oh! Residency.
- Yeah.

227
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,869
Are you a doc...

228
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,370
- A doctor?
- I'm a doctor. Yeah.

229
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,538
Oh! Wow!

230
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,041
- Yeah. Yeah. Um...
- That's impressive.

231
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:57,253
I just... I work
in reconstructive surgery.

232
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,797
You mean, um, plastic surgery.

233
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,382
- Yup. That's the one.
- Right.

234
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,884
- There's only one.
- Okay.

235
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,553
But it's not all nose jobs.

236
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,180
No, of course.
You got, you know...

237
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,639
- Boob jobs.
- Boob jobs.

238
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,309
- You got your butt lifts.
- Implants.

239
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,227
- Face-lifts
- Face-lifts.

240
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,354
But you know, once in a while

241
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,105
I get to help somebody,
which is nice though.

242
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,858
There was this kid
the other day who came in,

243
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,194
who had an accident
and he was badly burned.

244
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,988
So there's that, too.

245
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,490
I was just kidding. Sorry.

246
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,824
- There you go.
- Thank you.

247
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,619
- That is amazing.
- Don't worry.

248
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,037
That work for you?

249
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,331
- Wow. Yes.
- That do the trick?

250
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,500
- 'Cause that's all we got.
- I'm sorry. That's...

251
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,709
Perfect.

252
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,544
I only meant, like, a couple.
Thank you.

253
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,629
Cheers.

254
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,175
So, what about your family?

255
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,388
Uh... Well, I, um,
I don't have any siblings

256
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,015
and my dad died a while back, so...

257
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,061
I'm not sure where my mom is anymore
because we don't talk.

258
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,105
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

259
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,232
It's fine. Um...

260
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,526
- What about your family?
- Oh...

261
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,863
My dad is in Texas
and my mom passed away, actually.

262
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,490
- Sorry.
- So... But it's...

263
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,409
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

264
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,078
Well, we have something
in common, I guess.

265
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,996
- Yeah, dead parents.
- Yeah.

266
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,123
- Perfect.
- Great.

267
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:19,419
Let's cheers to that.

268
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,897
...coordinated like that.

269
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,482
- So you don't have Instagram.
- Nope.

270
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,609
Wow. What about, um, Twitter?

271
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
- Definitely not.
- No?

272
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,322
Does anyone say anything smart
on Twitter ever?

273
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,407
That's true.

274
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,826
No way. Come on.
It's the worst.

275
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,329
I mean, how am I supposed
to stalk you now?

276
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,666
You're just gonna
have to do it in person.

277
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,919
You know. Show up at my house,
the old-fashioned way.

278
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,045
Send me a letter!

279
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,422
- That would be nice.
- That would be nice.

280
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,631
"Dearest..."

281
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,592
"Yours truly."
Okay, I'll do that.

282
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,093
I'd love that.
That'd touch my heart.

283
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,553
That sounds nice.

284
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:19,937
What?

285
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,649
No, you just have a nice smile.

286
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,320
- Okay.
- You do.

287
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,948
All right, okay. Let's play a game.

288
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,910
Um... Tell me something
you don't want me to know.

289
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,787
- Hmm... Fun game. Okay.
- Yeah.

290
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,748
Ooh. It's risky.

291
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,417
Mmm...

292
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,377
Yes. Um...

293
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,047
I...

294
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,466
hate this.

295
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,220
I mean, um...

296
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,347
Okay. I'm sorry.

297
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,184
Not you, 'cause you seem cool,
but... No, I...

298
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,729
I hate, like, dating.

299
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,231
Mmm.

300
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,483
You know? Everything about it.

301
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,151
The, like...

302
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,738
The awkward preamble.

303
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,741
The, like, questions
and stuff. The, like...

304
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,827
You know, texting.

305
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,206
- The perfect projection.
- Yeah.

306
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,667
Everything about it. Honestly.

307
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,212
I don't know, I just think that, um...

308
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,344
people who, like, believe in true love
are fucking idiots.

309
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,305
So dumb.

310
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,015
- <i>They are.</i>
- <i>They're so dumb.</i>

311
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:43,229
<i>Like, we put all our hopes of, like,
finding happiness through someone else.</i>

312
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>And I just think that, like,</i>

313
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,985
<i>I don't know,
maybe it's not meant for me,</i>

314
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,322
<i>'cause I've, like, been alone so long,</i>

315
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>I'm actually pretty good at it.</i>

316
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,661
Fuck it.

317
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,563
What?

318
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:29,358
No, it's just...
Maybe it's a little too much.

319
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,485
A little too fast.

320
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,821
Oh, wow.

321
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,034
I don't think I've ever heard a guy
say that before.

322
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,329
Um, can I, uh...

323
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:44,373
Can I get you something
to, like, drink?

324
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,417
Or eat?

325
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,295
No, just...

326
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,964
Just you.

327
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,141
Mmm.

328
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,185
- Morning.
- Good morning.

329
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,855
Hello.

330
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,609
Coffee?

331
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,945
Yeah, yeah, please.

332
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,448
Just to, like, hide that morning breath.

333
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,284
Oh, God. Is it that bad?

334
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,660
Oh, no.

335
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,122
I'm not letting go of your hand.

336
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,791
Get off. Get off.

337
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,319
<i>Oh, we had sex.</i>

338
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,196
Get that D!

339
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,617
<i>Somewhere between the second
and the third drink I was like,</i>

340
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,160
"Fuck it."

341
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,621
And it was actually very freeing.

342
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,999
My "Fuck it" advice
always works. Damn.

343
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,543
Like, I wasn't even worrying
about how I looked

344
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:37,338
or like, if I was taking too long.

345
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,798
<i>Okay!</i>

346
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,133
What's his Instagram?
I wanna stalk a little bit.

347
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>Oh, he doesn't have one.</i>

348
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,345
- Say what?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

349
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,513
Whatcha mean?

350
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,390
Oh, no, see,
that's, that's shady.

351
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,975
I'm sorry. Red flag.

352
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,145
Okay. Whatever.
Stop raining on my sex parade.

353
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,772
Please?

354
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,608
Oh, by the way, um, do you remember Paul?

355
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,027
- Paul?
- <i>He was our bartender.</i>

356
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,280
Oh, yeah. Aw, Paul!

357
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,658
You know, I don't remember
why we stopped hooking up.

358
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,201
He was a good guy.

359
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,911
And a good kisser, too.

360
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,247
<i>Probably because you can't be tamed.</i>

361
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,915
<i>You need to roam free.</i>

362
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,208
That is true.

363
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,378
<i>All right, well, I gotta get back to work.
I love you.</i>

364
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,797
- Okay, love you more. Bye!
- <i>Bye!</i>

365
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,391
You have to try these short ribs,
they're insane.

366
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,061
Yeah, they look really good,
but I, um...

367
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,523
I just don't eat animals.

368
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,941
Oh!

369
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,027
But... But keep eating.
Don't... Don't stop.

370
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,321
In fact, I actually
want you to finish that plate.

371
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,532
I dare you to finish that plate.

372
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,871
- No!
- No, no... Why?

373
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,664
- This is my favorite...
- But it does...

374
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,291
...fucking short ribs.

375
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,085
- Hey, listen, you have to eat the...
- I can't. You've ruined it for me now.

376
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,253
Yeah.

377
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,964
I'm gonna wash my hands,
I think.

378
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,261
So have you, uh,
have you told anyone about me?

379
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,680
Maybe.

380
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,725
My best friend, Mollie.

381
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:16,937
What did you tell
your best friend, Mollie?

382
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,525
Um, that I met a cool guy.

383
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,153
And I might kind of like him.

384
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,405
- Just, like, a little bit.
- Uh-huh.

385
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,199
- Tell me more about Mollie.
- Um...

386
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:34,496
Well, we met, like, I think
it was like seven years ago,

387
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,417
um, when I first moved here.
We worked together for a bit.

388
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,171
Think you'd really get along.

389
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,297
Hmm.

390
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,928
I don't know about you,
but I am stuffed.

391
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,431
I think we should dance.

392
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,974
What?

393
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,226
Let's go. Come on.

394
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,021
Yes. Yes, yes,
let's go, let's go.

395
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,648
- I wanna see those moves.
- Okay.

396
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,608
I wanna see those moves.
Get in the center here.

397
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,860
Let me turn this up.

398
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,028
Here we go.

399
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,741
Okay.

400
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,117
Just a little sway.

401
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,204
It's just a little two-step
for now.

402
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,790
- It's all in the little moves.
- It's all in the face.

403
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,792
It's in the shoulders.

404
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,043
I mean, I can hop.

405
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,170
Oh, the hip thrust!
Oh, my God.

406
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,047
Nah, you don't have...

407
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,091
This. That.

408
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,346
- Yeah. To me.
- Oh, no, no. Okay.

409
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,056
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

410
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,016
Looks like we're salsa-ing.

411
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,893
It's a salsa.

412
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,731
- You are... moves.
- Oh, my God.

413
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,404
I have to. I have to.

414
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,281
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
It was a really good picture.

415
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,742
- You need to delete that.
- I will never delete that.

416
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,124
We should go away somewhere.

417
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:04,878
Do you want to?

418
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,299
Uh, yeah.

419
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,093
- Yeah?
- Yeah, um...

420
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,720
Fuck it. Why not?

421
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,305
I mean, where?

422
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,849
Wherever.

423
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,393
Somewhere... Somewhere nice.

424
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,396
Somewhere... fun.

425
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,986
Maybe it'll be a surprise.

426
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,489
Fuck it.

427
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:33,574
Yeah.

428
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,493
Yeah.

429
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:40,080
<i>Um, I'm going away
with Steve for the weekend.</i>

430
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:42,082
What? Where?

431
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,001
- <i>It's a surprise.</i>
- Hold on, Noa.

432
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:49,173
Uh-uh. A surprise?
I don't like that.

433
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,801
I'm just gonna go for it.
You said, "Fuck it," remember?

434
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,013
Girl, you all dickmatized.
I haven't even seen this dude.

435
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,098
Oh, shit, I totally forgot. Hold on.

436
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,391
I'm sending you a picture of him.

437
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,355
I mean, he looks cute,

438
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,233
but I can barely even tell, you creep.

439
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,778
Um, he is ridiculously cute.

440
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:14,406
I'll, um, I'll text you once we get there
and let you know everything, okay?

441
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,491
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

442
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,327
Um, I'm excited for you.

443
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,080
It's a straight girl's fantasy
come true, right?

444
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,623
<i>Right?</i>

445
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,750
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you more.

446
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,210
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

447
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,092
- Hey.
- Hi.

448
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,636
Sorry. My day ran long.

449
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:38,347
Uh, listen, we're gonna have
to leave in the morning.

450
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,016
I just checked the traffic
and it's a nightmare.

451
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,893
So I figured maybe we go to my place

452
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,978
and then, you know,
we leave first thing tomorrow.

453
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,814
- Is that cool?
- Yeah. Okay.

454
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,524
Look at you.

455
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,734
All right.

456
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,611
I'm excited.

457
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,385
How you doing?

458
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,512
- You all right?
- Yeah. Good.

459
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,935
Fuck. I'm just gonna tell you.

460
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,147
We're going to Cottage Grove.
That's the surprise.

461
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:29,940
That's it.

462
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

463
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,193
- That's the surprise?
- Yeah.

464
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,987
What?
I've always wanted to go.

465
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,155
You're not just saying that?

466
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,948
I'm not just saying that.
No, I really have.

467
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:42,077
I mean, I hate surprises,
so I'm kinda glad you told me.

468
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,412
Yeah, it's gonna be good.

469
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,915
Ugh. My cell isn't working.

470
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,168
Yeah, the service is, um,

471
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,503
shitty, but it's gonna
get better at my place.

472
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,380
Cool.

473
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,807
Fresh air, right?

474
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:47,100
Yeah.

475
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,727
It's amazing.

476
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,062
Who knew?

477
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,881
Oh.

478
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,969
Kinda disappointing.

479
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,204
Sizing me up?

480
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,622
Oh. Yeah.

481
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,040
Smells good.

482
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,711
My sister got me that.

483
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,672
Apparently she thinks I like sandalwood.

484
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,966
Okay.

485
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,346
Do you have, um...

486
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,764
Do you have Wi-Fi?

487
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,392
Still no service.

488
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,227
Fuck, must've gone out again.

489
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,937
By the way,

490
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,940
um, I'm making my own version

491
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,942
of an old-fashioned with a twist.

492
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,029
And, um, it's gonna have
some cherries in it.

493
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,448
Very thoughtful.

494
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:47,929
Cheers.

495
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,474
Cheers.

496
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,772
- Mmm.
- Mmm?

497
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,648
That's really good.

498
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,941
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

499
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,069
Notice any interesting flavors
in there?

500
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,653
Um...

501
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,909
- Peach?
- No.

502
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,744
Close, very close.

503
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,995
Um...

504
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,084
- Apricot?
- Oh.

505
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,795
- No.
- No?

506
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,546
- What? Fuck.
- So close.

507
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,757
So close. Come on.

508
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,261
Hmm.

509
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,349
- Nectarine?
- Yes!

510
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,184
- Really?
- Yeah, you got it.

511
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,271
Nectarine.

512
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,067
Um...

513
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:47,114
Your, uh, your house is intimidating.

514
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,325
You're all, like, you know,

515
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,956
fancy cocktails, and I'm like
pancakes out of a bag.

516
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,001
Yeah, but that's what I like about you.

517
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,129
No pretending.

518
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,048
Hmm.

519
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,848
By the way, that, um...
The house in Cottage Grove,

520
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,391
it has a hot tub.

521
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,727
I don't know what you packed
in that big bag of yours,

522
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,564
but adjustable jets,

523
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,983
multiple lights, the whole ordeal.

524
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,193
It's gonna be like
New Year's Eve in there.

525
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,740
What? Sorry.

526
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:35,203
You're gonna need a bathing suit.

527
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,584
Noa. Noa, look at me.

528
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,504
Why are you sitting so far away?

529
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:47,632
Come here.

530
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:48,503
Hey.

531
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,796
Hi.

532
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,216
How did you sleep?

533
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,553
Yeah, good. Um...

534
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,264
What...

535
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,058
What happened?

536
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,606
I drugged you.

537
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,876
What, um...

538
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,797
What's going on, Steve?

539
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,844
I'm gonna tell you,
but you're gonna freak out.

540
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,980
No, no. No, no, no, no.

541
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,691
Hmm. Hmm...

542
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,235
Mmm-mmm.

543
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,615
Steve, can you
take these off, please?

544
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,408
Can't do that.

545
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,454
Can you take these off?

546
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,414
- Can't do that.
- Steve.

547
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,462
Take this off.

548
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,424
I can't do that.

549
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,559
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

550
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,812
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

551
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,440
- No. No. This isn't happening.
- Yeah, it's happening.

552
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,025
This isn't happening.
This isn't happening.

553
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,110
Yes, it is.

554
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,197
Please, please, please, please.
This is a joke.

555
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,533
Isn't it, Steve?

556
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,243
Look,
why don't you just try to...

557
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,787
- Noa.
- Don't! Don't! Don't!

558
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,331
- I'm gonna stay right here.
- Don't come near me.

559
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,167
- Do not come near me.
- I'm staying right here.

560
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,545
Steve!

561
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,464
Noa.

562
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,638
Come on, Noa, think. What...

563
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,059
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

564
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,108
Steve...

565
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,862
are you gonna rape me?

566
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,576
I'm not gonna rape you.

567
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,582
I like you, Noa. I like you.

568
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,709
All right?

569
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,628
Now, I want you to listen to me
very carefully, okay?

570
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,047
Are you listening to me?

571
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,799
Noa!

572
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,053
There you are.

573
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,850
I'm gonna tell you now.

574
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,563
I'm gonna sell your meat.

575
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,984
People pay me a lot of money for it.

576
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,527
And your hair.

577
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,029
And weird shit like that.

578
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,239
It's a thing.

579
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:04,783
So...

580
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,368
I'm not...
I'm not gonna kill you...

581
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,413
...uh, right away...

582
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,708
Because the fresher the meat,
the better.

583
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,336
So I'm gonna keep you alive
for as long as I can.

584
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,173
Unless you act up.

585
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,551
All right? But listen, until then,

586
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,761
I'm gonna take care of you.

587
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:25,929
I'm gonna cook for you.

588
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,180
I'm actually a really good cook.

589
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,389
You don't know it yet.

590
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,101
As long as you don't act up,
nothing bad has to happen, all right?

591
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,062
And look. This isn't bad, right?

592
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,563
By the way, look at the sunset. Look...

593
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,776
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

594
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,195
- Come here. Come here.
- No! No! No!

595
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,074
It's okay. It's okay.

596
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,117
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

597
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,994
No! No!

598
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,553
Be quiet. Calm down.

599
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:13,810
Stop being so dramatic.

600
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,522
It's okay.

601
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,731
It's okay.

602
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,944
There you go.

603
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,170
<i>Hi,
where the fuck are you?</i>

604
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,089
<i>You're getting me all freaked out.</i>

605
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,426
Call me or text me.

606
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,887
<i>And I wanna hear where he took you.</i>

607
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,945
Trippin'.

608
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:16,372
Help me!

609
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,918
He's not here.

610
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,670
Help me!

611
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,716
Help me, please! Please!
Please, I'll do anything!

612
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,177
I can't...
I can't help you.

613
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,762
We're in the same boat.

614
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,641
Fuck!

615
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,397
Tell me your name.

616
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,945
Noa.

617
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,365
I'm Penny.

618
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,035
I was in town visiting.

619
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,621
Met Steve.

620
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,877
Now I'm slowly...

621
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,129
being eaten.

622
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,716
How long have you been here?

623
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,927
I've lost track.

624
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:15,014
I'm not even sure what time of day it is,
to be honest.

625
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,937
People have to be looking for you.

626
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,355
Your... Your...

627
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,357
Your friends, your family, the police.

628
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,401
People have to be searching by now.

629
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,320
The problem is,

630
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,531
I don't have much family.

631
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,743
Me neither.

632
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,746
Makes sense.

633
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,047
Are there others?

634
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:53,761
Just one other
besides us, I think.

635
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,724
Hey, Melissa, can you hear me?

636
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,818
She's lost her mind.

637
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,030
But I get it.

638
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,283
No judgment here.

639
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,585
We have to get out of here.

640
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,275
Hmm...

641
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,871
Motherfucking...

642
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:15,676
Okay.

643
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,746
Fuck.

644
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,776
Hey.

645
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,236
How are you?

646
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,491
Still angry.

647
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,703
At least try the cake.

648
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,038
I need to shower.

649
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:39,588
Alone?

650
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,094
It's a joke.
It was a stupid joke.

651
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:47,179
I'm trying, you know?
I'm trying to...

652
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,640
I'm trying to make you laugh
and it's not working.

653
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,144
Can't you just give me one smile, please?

654
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:54,729
Just one?

655
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,111
Is that a yes?

656
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,950
Okay.

657
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,662
God, I mean,

658
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,956
you're gonna have to
loosen up a little bit.

659
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,125
I know things are a little different,

660
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,878
but it's still me, you know?

661
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,504
Still the guy I was at the bar that night.

662
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,964
I meant everything I said to you.

663
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,257
Just...

664
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,927
no games, right?
No projections?

665
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:28,763
Isn't that what you wanted?

666
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,109
Are you gonna be good?

667
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,569
Bad girl.

668
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,394
<i>I don't wanna lose you</i>

669
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,981
<i>I don't want you walking away</i>

670
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,820
<i>We're so good together</i>

671
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,697
I can't move.

672
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,073
I know.

673
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,827
I gave you an epidural,
so you won't feel much.

674
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,414
What are you doing?

675
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,625
Hmm...

676
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,044
I'm taking your ass.

677
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:08,631
No.

678
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,841
- Yes.
- No.

679
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,635
You lost my trust, Noa.

680
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,888
So there are gonna have to be
consequences.

681
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,476
<i>Don't leave me here
with my restless heart</i>

682
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:23,270
Please.

683
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:26,649
I'm cauterizing your ass
so you won't be a bloody mess.

684
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,944
- Please stop.
- Noa, it's gonna be okay.

685
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,862
Hey, I'm a doctor, remember?

686
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,125
Hey.

687
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,170
Yo.

688
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,838
Thanks for letting me stop by.

689
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,133
Yeah, well, you didn't
really give me a choice, so...

690
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,844
Boy, stop acting like
you didn't wanna see me.

691
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,472
And I wanted
to see your face again.

692
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,433
- You wanted to see my face?
- Yeah.

693
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:02,601
You wanted
to see my face.

694
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:03,686
I did.

695
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,730
Mollie, you ain't never gonna change.
I still can't give you his info.

696
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,399
If I even had it.

697
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,900
Come on, please?

698
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,111
It's the only connection
that I have right now.

699
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:13,404
Why don't you just go to the police?

700
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,613
- The police.
- Yeah.

701
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:15,906
And say what?

702
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,908
That my best friend went away with a guy

703
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,952
and extended her trip
and she's texting me,

704
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,203
but I don't think it's her?

705
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:22,871
Why not? She white, right?

706
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:24,790
Don't do that.

707
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,418
No, I'm playin', I'm playin'.
Listen, I get it.

708
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,254
I get it. But I could
lose my job, Mollie.

709
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,756
Look, she wouldn't just
disappear like this, okay?

710
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,259
Look, I can tell you
when they were here.

711
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,343
Mollie.

712
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,137
She told me
that you were their bartender

713
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:40,097
and he must have used
a credit card, right?

714
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,809
Look, even just his last name
would be a huge help.

715
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,853
Please?

716
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,063
What are you doing?

717
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,440
She's doing the pouty lip.

718
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,150
Don't do the pouty lip.
Don't do that.

719
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,861
Just think about it. For me?

720
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,030
I'll think about it.

721
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,699
- Can we shake on it?
- You remember that?

722
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,534
- Do you remember it?
- Do I...

723
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,994
Shit.

724
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:04,663
- Hey.
- Get outta here.

725
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,249
You lookin' good, by the way.

726
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

727
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,627
- It's the beard.
- Mmm.

728
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,295
Yeah, it's connecting now.

729
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,005
Got this new beard oil.

730
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,020
<i>Noa.</i>

731
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,939
<i>How's your ass?</i>

732
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,067
<i>Still gone.</i>

733
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,904
<i>The pain meds are helping me
not care as much.</i>

734
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,409
He's so sweet, right?

735
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,583
I just wanna hurt him, Penny.

736
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,380
It's all I think about.

737
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,844
I can't believe I slept with him.

738
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,429
Wait,

739
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,223
you fucked him?

740
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,309
I never did.

741
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,814
I don't think
any of the others did either.

742
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,734
I am not slut-shaming you,
by the way.

743
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,488
I'd say it's a compliment.

744
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,533
I'm so fucking stupid.

745
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,954
No. You're not.

746
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,460
It is not our fault, Noa.

747
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:40,175
It's...

748
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,136
always...

749
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,846
theirs.

750
00:54:26,722 --> 00:54:29,475
What...

751
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:33,896
The fuck?

752
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,647
Get the fuck off me.

753
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,106
Fuck.

754
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,812
Wow, you did it.

755
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,064
Mom, I made it!

756
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,755
Extra cherries.

757
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:25,716
You've earned it.

758
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,262
Oh, fuck.

759
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,556
I'm so tired.

760
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,602
Woke up at 2:00 a. m. last night
going, "Really? Now?"

761
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,396
I had to be up at 6:00.

762
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:40,772
Then you know you're not
going back to sleep.

763
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:43,609
You're up fuckin' three hours later.
How are the meds?

764
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,696
Great, great, great.

765
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,239
Still in denial?

766
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,117
Yeah. Well...

767
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,913
Look, it's gonna take a little time,

768
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,249
but eventually,
you're gonna learn to accept

769
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:03,170
that things don't always turn out
the way you thought they would.

770
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,380
You know, we all die.

771
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,633
But it's really just how
we decide to go out.

772
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,844
Why did you sleep with me, Steve?

773
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,812
I told you, I, um...

774
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:24,942
I told you, I liked you.

775
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,154
Anyway, it was a mistake.

776
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,537
All right, try to relax.

777
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,457
Fear and stress isn't good for the meat.

778
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,541
<i>Penny?</i>

779
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,712
Penny, please, just answer already.

780
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:31,591
Please, Penny.

781
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,220
Penny!

782
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,847
What do you want?

783
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,181
Oh, fuck.

784
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,600
Jesus.

785
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,061
Now, was that so hard?

786
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,525
I'm done, Noa.

787
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,030
No, you're not.

788
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,787
I don't even know who I am anymore.

789
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,713
I hope he fucking chokes.

790
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,761
<i>And then he gets a fucking tapeworm.</i>

791
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:21,558
And it just eats him
from the inside, slowly.

792
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,228
And that all his weirdo friends

793
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:30,692
shit and puke out of their eyes

794
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,821
<i>till they all fucking die.</i>

795
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,119
You're such a sweetheart, Penny.

796
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,375
Just...

797
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:50,921
stay strong.

798
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:52,964
Okay?

799
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,676
- I'll get you those nuts.
- Thanks.

800
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,245
<i>Whatever you're selling,</i>

801
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,329
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

802
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:27,165
Oh, no. I'm not
selling anything. Sorry.

803
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,668
My name is Mollie, and...

804
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,044
<i>Do I know you?</i>

805
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:32,546
No.

806
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,881
But I'm looking
for my friend, Noa,

807
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,675
and I was hoping you could help me.

808
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,136
I think your husband might know her.

809
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:41,388
It really should only take a minute.

810
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,439
You do realize how strange
that sounds, right?

811
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,567
Yes, I do, and, um...

812
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,070
I don't really know
how to say this, but, um...

813
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,324
I think she may have been
seeing your husband.

814
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,453
What are you talking about?

815
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:15,714
Hi.

816
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,259
Hi.

817
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,519
Do you need anything?

818
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,771
No. Thank you.

819
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,109
Okay.

820
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,073
What does it taste like?

821
01:01:50,165 --> 01:01:51,166
Well...

822
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:56,963
It depends on where it comes from
and how it's prepared.

823
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,426
But...

824
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,308
if it's done right...

825
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:14,022
it's fucking exquisite.

826
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,901
It's like nothing you've ever had before.

827
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:22,989
Hmm.

828
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,251
That's it?

829
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,944
Go up to the playroom
while I make dinner, okay?

830
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,446
Yeah! I got here first!

831
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,740
Listen, um...

832
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:10,745
I'm not even positive
that's my husband in the picture.

833
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,998
You can't really see the face.

834
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,502
Plus I saw him this morning
before he went to work, so...

835
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,381
- Here.
- Thanks.

836
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,592
Honestly, this is...
This is crazy.

837
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,056
You should go to the police
if you're so worried about your friend.

838
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:33,643
Um...

839
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,062
Does he ever go out of town

840
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,398
- for work or anything?
- No.

841
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:42,110
Well, they went away to Cottage Grove,
like, a week ago,

842
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:45,989
and I haven't heard from her
since then and I'm just...

843
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,699
I don't know where that is.

844
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:52,871
- I'm just worried, okay?
- Yeah, I understand.

845
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,041
I'm really sorry.

846
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:58,376
Um...

847
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,838
That's my husband right now.
You need to leave, okay?

848
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,842
I'm just desperate. Woman-to-woman,
maybe your husband has more information.

849
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,136
I'm not trying to mess
anything up for anybody here.

850
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,220
I'm just trying to find my friend.

851
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:10,305
- Hey.
- Hey.

852
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,892
- Hello. Hi.
- Hey.

853
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,357
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

854
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,442
Nothing. This woman was just leaving.

855
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,486
You're Steve, right?

856
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,196
No, I'm Brendan.

857
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,365
But you go by Steve, right?

858
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,327
No. Just Brendan. Who are you?

859
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,996
I'm Mollie. Um...

860
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:39,417
My friend Noa, uh, I think
you know her, she's missing.

861
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,878
Noa. Um...

862
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:44,297
No, I'm sorry, I... I don't.

863
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,382
Um...

864
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,884
- Do you, honey?
- No, of course not.

865
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:52,555
That's terrible. Yeah, I don't know,
I think you have the wrong house.

866
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,812
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.

867
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,481
Okay.

868
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,691
- I'm sorry. Sorry about that.
- No.

869
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:04,984
We're sorry
we couldn't help you.

870
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,653
Sorry about your friend.

871
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,201
I'm just thinking, when's
the last time you saw her?

872
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,421
Oh, it's you.

873
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,507
Mollie, right?

874
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,427
Really shouldn't have done that.

875
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,494
<i>Noa said we'd get along.</i>

876
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:57,579
Fuck!

877
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:03,585
Let's see.

878
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:11,926
So...

879
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,597
why did you ask me what it tasted like?

880
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,935
Um...

881
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:22,353
I don't know.

882
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:28,109
I guess I was... curious.

883
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,196
You were curious?

884
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,407
You expect me to believe that?

885
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,828
You can believe what you want.

886
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,627
Okay.

887
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,469
Let's have dinner
and we'll see how curious you are.

888
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:58,890
Brought you some stuff.
Figured you might wanna...

889
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,392
change.

890
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,368
Mmm.

891
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,970
Fuck.

892
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,647
The boys go down okay?

893
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,775
Mmm-hmm. They asked for you.

894
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,540
How was work?

895
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:48,708
Good.

896
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,128
Actually, I'm gonna be late
tomorrow night.

897
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,340
Lots to do now with the new product.

898
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,259
Got some big clients expecting deliveries.

899
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,859
I'm gonna take a shower.

900
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:16,527
Good teamwork today.

901
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,083
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna drug you.

902
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,085
Again.

903
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:03,796
You better not.

904
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:08,426
Cheers.

905
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:12,179
Cheers.

906
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,731
So you mentioned
you were curious.

907
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:25,318
Yeah.

908
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,446
All right,
what do you wanna know?

909
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,158
Well...

910
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,328
Um...

911
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,582
When did you first try it?

912
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,167
Um...

913
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,587
I was, um, 18 or 19.

914
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,381
Nineteen, yeah.

915
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:48,799
And, look...

916
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,637
it wasn't an overnight thing,
you know?

917
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,305
First, I was actually horrified.

918
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:58,184
I mean, how could possibly be
capable of doing something like this?

919
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:02,480
You know, I was a normal kid,
I had friends, I had a normal life,

920
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,192
and now I gotta deal with this thing

921
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,570
that I couldn't share with anybody.

922
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:10,821
And that killed me.

923
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,783
But I couldn't stop thinking about it.

924
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:18,120
I couldn't get the, um,
taste out of my mouth.

925
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:19,997
The texture.

926
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,627
I liked it. I liked the way
it made me feel.

927
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:28,714
So I thought, "I gotta find out
if there's more out there," you know.

928
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,968
"I can't possibly be the only person
that feels this way."

929
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,387
And I wasn't.

930
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,057
There's a whole community
of people that are devoted to this.

931
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:44,397
And that's when my life
started making sense.

932
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,400
I mean, it's...

933
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:51,153
It's a very powerful thing.

934
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:55,408
This whole world,
if you only knew. It's, um...

935
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,578
It's about giving.

936
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:04,709
Giving yourself over to somebody.

937
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:09,547
Becoming one
with somebody else, forever.

938
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:11,924
And that's...

939
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,511
That's a beautiful thing.

940
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,223
That's surrender.

941
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,976
That's love.

942
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,820
And how many people
are in this community?

943
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,613
Not many.

944
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,075
The one percent of the one percent.

945
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:42,204
You know, there's nothing
these people can't afford, right?

946
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,123
They want the one thing

947
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,459
that no one else has

948
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,544
or can get.

949
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,630
And that's where I come in.

950
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:54,967
I can get it for them.

951
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,638
I made a name for myself.

952
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,852
Is it only women that you eat?

953
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:07,772
Yeah.

954
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,357
Why?

955
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,069
That's where the market is.

956
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,072
Plus, women just taste better.

957
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,116
So...

958
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,080
I cooked us something.

959
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,208
If you're open to trying it.

960
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:34,090
Is it...

961
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,384
Is it me?

962
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,138
No.

963
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,518
We'll have a bite together.

964
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:44,451
This meal is about $30,000.

965
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:47,872
That's crazy.

966
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,583
Be a lot more if she was still alive.

967
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,418
Hope.

968
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:55,254
That was her name.

969
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:57,840
Kinda funny.

970
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,427
It's kinda funny.

971
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,012
Stupid.

972
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,101
It's not what I expected.

973
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:12,771
It's, um...

974
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:16,984
It's indescribable.

975
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,844
Thank you, Steve.

976
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:46,805
You're welcome, Noa.

977
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,354
You know how I knew
you were special?

978
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,609
'Cause you're fucked up, too.

979
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,161
All right. Let's go.

980
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:29,283
Noa!

981
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:33,787
Penny. Yeah?

982
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:37,916
That definitely
didn't sound like Melissa.

983
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,544
Yeah.

984
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,047
Sounds like someone new.

985
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,934
<i>You know, the other night,</i>

986
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,354
<i>I was thinking</i>

987
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:02,066
<i>about how nice</i>

988
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,651
<i>it's been to talk to you.</i>

989
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:10,574
<i>But then I was like,
what if you're not real...</i>

990
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:16,497
<i>...and I'm just going crazy?</i>

991
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,125
Like Melissa.

992
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:28,384
But I feel like if I had
an imaginary friend,

993
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,054
I wouldn't name her Noa.

994
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:34,932
It'd be, like...

995
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,559
Sean Connery.

996
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:53,075
I wish I could see you.

997
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,543
Me, too.

998
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,262
<i>I have something for you.</i>

999
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:17,391
Go ahead.

1000
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:19,685
Open it.

1001
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:46,962
Do you like it?

1002
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:53,427
It's pink.

1003
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,805
I love it.

1004
01:22:57,848 --> 01:22:58,849
Thank you.

1005
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:01,894
Maybe you can wear it
tonight and, uh,

1006
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,147
we can have dinner again.

1007
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,942
Yeah. Okay.

1008
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:14,156
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

1009
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,993
I have no idea what time it is.

1010
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:19,077
I know.

1011
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:21,788
Sure.

1012
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:33,550
Maybe you can freshen up.

1013
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,106
Well, hello.

1014
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:13,275
Hi.

1015
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,709
I see we've made it
to the dinner table.

1016
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,253
Yes, we have.

1017
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,716
Is, um...?

1018
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,218
Is this a date, Steve?

1019
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,015
Maybe it is.

1020
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,412
- Ooh.
- Well...

1021
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:09,706
All right.

1022
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,126
It's gonna be an interesting night.

1023
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,586
Yeah.

1024
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:15,754
It is.

1025
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:17,464
Great.

1026
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:20,717
Let's get drunk.

1027
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,096
I was thinking about
what you said that night.

1028
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,223
About growing up alone and all.

1029
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:32,604
Made me realize nobody's
ever really cooked for you.

1030
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,232
And that made me sad.

1031
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,654
Everyone has to have
someone cook for them once.

1032
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,198
Pate.

1033
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,784
Liver.

1034
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,494
And garlic and rosemary.

1035
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,382
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1036
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:02,300
I do taste the garlic.

1037
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:04,928
Definitely. Whoa.

1038
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,432
You can make it next time.
Just the way you like it.

1039
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:16,773
Who's this?

1040
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,944
- This?
- Mmm.

1041
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:25,949
This is Melissa.

1042
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:33,665
Melissa.

1043
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,799
I mean, that's so boring.

1044
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,843
Isn't it?

1045
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:46,970
Like, she...

1046
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:51,683
She tastes so, you know, decadent...

1047
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,686
and her name's Melissa.

1048
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:56,229
Well...

1049
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,525
Thought you were gonna
say something, you know, like,

1050
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:02,778
Joy.

1051
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:07,699
Guess we finished all of Hope.

1052
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:10,368
Oh, no,
there's more Hope left.

1053
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:20,420
Did Melissa ever get a candlelit dinner?

1054
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,069
Welcome to my world.

1055
01:28:46,446 --> 01:28:48,532
The clients wanna
feel closer to the women.

1056
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,746
They become a part of you in some way.

1057
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:02,712
There's Melissa.

1058
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:07,843
And no, she never had
a candlelight dinner.

1059
01:29:25,986 --> 01:29:27,612
Where is my stuff?

1060
01:29:35,287 --> 01:29:36,997
With me, I guess.

1061
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,347
All right, come on.

1062
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,474
There's more to eat.

1063
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:02,898
We never did make it

1064
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,524
to Cottage Grove, did we?

1065
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,319
That's too bad.

1066
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,240
It's really serene out there.

1067
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:16,119
Really makes me wanna hug a tree.

1068
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:21,666
Anyway, who knows?
Maybe we could still go.

1069
01:30:24,294 --> 01:30:27,255
Okay, so this is, uh,

1070
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,257
breast meat.

1071
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:32,928
And it's, um, it's really nice.

1072
01:30:33,136 --> 01:30:35,889
It's fatty and subtle.

1073
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,265
I don't know.

1074
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,351
It might even be familiar.

1075
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,271
What?

1076
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:44,856
- No, it's...
- Is it...?

1077
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:46,399
No, it's, uh...

1078
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:49,069
It's just stupid.

1079
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:51,279
- No, no, no, go ahead.
- No, I can't.

1080
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:52,364
Come on.

1081
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:54,407
You gotta tell me.

1082
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:56,534
No, it's just, um...

1083
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,163
You saved the breast till last.

1084
01:31:08,004 --> 01:31:09,506
Oh, my God.

1085
01:31:09,589 --> 01:31:10,590
That was, um...

1086
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,592
That's good.

1087
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:16,846
This is really nice, Steve. You know?

1088
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:23,186
You're right, no one has ever
cooked for me, so...

1089
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:27,315
It's not quite
how I pictured it,

1090
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:29,901
but, you know, it's... It is nice.

1091
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:30,986
Yeah.

1092
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:33,697
She's got better tits than me.

1093
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,492
You're not disagreeing?

1094
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:40,704
- No, it's not...
- Thanks, Steve.

1095
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:42,706
- I wasn't saying that.
- Thanks a lot, Steve.

1096
01:31:49,212 --> 01:31:50,463
What's...?

1097
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:02,851
Um...

1098
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:11,359
Sorry.

1099
01:32:12,235 --> 01:32:13,653
Sorry, it's just...

1100
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:18,158
Um, it's just...

1101
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,328
It is really nice.

1102
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:25,915
And it's...

1103
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:28,209
It's...

1104
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:31,713
all just so confusing.

1105
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,385
And I can't quite process...

1106
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,685
...'cause I feel awful.

1107
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:51,483
I feel...

1108
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:54,694
awful.

1109
01:32:57,864 --> 01:32:58,865
'Cause...

1110
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:03,578
'Cause I don't... I don't feel awful.

1111
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:09,667
Fuck.

1112
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,252
Hey, come here.

1113
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:14,964
Noa.

1114
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:17,383
Hey.

1115
01:33:19,094 --> 01:33:20,345
It's okay.

1116
01:33:23,348 --> 01:33:25,433
It's okay.

1117
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,903
It's all gonna be okay.

1118
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,577
You're just different.

1119
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:49,874
And I knew it
from the moment I met you.

1120
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,492
I forgot to handcuff you.

1121
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,246
Yeah.

1122
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,040
You did.

1123
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,840
Do you wanna dance?

1124
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:48,016
Yeah.

1125
01:34:52,562 --> 01:34:53,730
Yeah, I do.

1126
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,796
Fuck!

1127
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:33,723
You fuck!

1128
01:37:35,016 --> 01:37:36,309
Oh, God!

1129
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,816
Come on, come on.

1130
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:47,987
You fucking bitch.

1131
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:56,829
Hurry.

1132
01:37:56,913 --> 01:38:00,041
Goddamn it, Noa!

1133
01:38:01,918 --> 01:38:04,295
You fucking bitch!

1134
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:06,381
I'm gonna cut your heart out!

1135
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:12,929
Oh, my God, Mollie.

1136
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:16,140
Are you okay? Are you okay?

1137
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:20,395
I'm so sorry.
Hey, come on, come on. Okay.

1138
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,313
- Oh, fuck.
- Give me your hand.

1139
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,564
What is wrong with you?

1140
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,858
I can't tell you right now, but I will.

1141
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:27,693
Put those on. I'll be right back!

1142
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:28,778
Where are you going?

1143
01:38:31,656 --> 01:38:34,033
Penny? Oh, my God, Penny!
Are you okay?

1144
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,327
It's so good to finally see you.
Are you okay?

1145
01:38:36,452 --> 01:38:37,662
Mollie! Mollie!

1146
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,122
- Noa?
- Mollie, come help!

1147
01:38:39,288 --> 01:38:41,541
- Noa? Oh, my God.
- Come on, we gotta go.

1148
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:51,050
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1149
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:52,176
You good?

1150
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:01,394
Oh, shit!

1151
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:02,854
Oh, fuck.

1152
01:39:53,488 --> 01:39:55,490
Mollie. Mollie.

1153
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:01,496
Mollie.

1154
01:40:08,586 --> 01:40:10,129
- Come here.
- No. No!

1155
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,089
Where do you think
you're going, Noa, huh?

1156
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:13,382
Where do you think you're going?

1157
01:40:13,549 --> 01:40:15,009
Think you're going somewhere?

1158
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,469
You're not gonna fucking leave.

1159
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:20,348
Fuck.

1160
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,414
No!

1161
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:51,712
We gotta get
the fuck outta here.

1162
01:41:03,516 --> 01:41:04,684
Fuck.

1163
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:15,528
Naw, son, this shit is creepy as fuck.

1164
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,156
I must've taken a wrong turn back there.

1165
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:22,451
This some bullshit.

1166
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:26,163
Whoa.

1167
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,875
Come on, Mollie.

1168
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,336
Where you at?

1169
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:33,921
How the fuck did he get you?

1170
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:37,675
I was trying to find you,
but I found him.

1171
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,260
I knew shit was off.

1172
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:42,555
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.

1173
01:41:42,722 --> 01:41:44,515
You guys are so cute.

1174
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:46,642
Oh, fuck! Oh, shit.

1175
01:41:46,726 --> 01:41:48,519
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1176
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:51,063
We gotta get up.
I'm gonna pick you up.

1177
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:57,862
Noa!

1178
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,697
Oh, fuck.

01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,793
You lied to me!

1183
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,298
I'm gonna kill all you fucking bitches!

1184
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:19,884
Watch out! He has a gun!

1185
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:24,513
Naw, fuck this shit.

1186
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:28,100
We gotta split up.
We gotta zigzag.

1187
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,395
Fuck.

1188
01:42:34,607 --> 01:42:36,025
Come on, man, we seen this movie.

1189
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:38,527
We don't make it out this bitch alive,

1190
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,364
GPS got me twisted and shit.

1191
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:44,200
Noa!

1192

I'm sorry!

1193
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,872
Okay? I'm sorry!

1194
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:52,249
I'm sorry.

1195
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:56,128
Is that what you want me to say?

1196
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,339
Huh?

1197
01:43:15,815 --> 01:43:17,400
Get a flashlight.

1198
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:45,010
Go ahead,
you keep on fucking hiding.

1199
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:46,595
You keep on fucking hiding!

1200
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:53,853
Stupid fucking weak

That's what you are.

1203
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:02,570
Fucking bitches.

1204

01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:07,468
Fuck.

1211
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:19,063
We did it, okay? We're safe.

1212
01:45:21,398 --> 01:45:23,150
Penny, are you okay?

1213
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:30,241
Fuck!

Fuck!

1215
01:45:32,827 --> 01:45:34,495
I don't have any signal.

1216
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:36,747
Oh, shit.

1217
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:39,166
I left my phone.

1218
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:42,086
- Okay, you stay with Penny.
- What?

1219
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:45,714
- You goin' back out there?
- I gotta get my phone.

1220
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:48,425
Look, come right the fuck back, okay?

1221
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:49,510
Okay.

1222
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:51,428

1223
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,390
Come here.

1224
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,337
Hmm.

1225
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:32,011
We need to clean this up.

1226
01:46:33,137 --> 01:46:34,555
Yes, ma'am.

1227
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:36,473
Let's get his body on ice.

1228
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:37,808
Yes, ma'am.

1229
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:51,488
Come on, come on.

1230

Yes. Yes.

1231
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:08,088
- Oh, my God, you got him.
- What?

1232
01:47:08,213 --> 01:47:10,215
I thought this would never end.

1233
01:47:10,299 --> 01:47:11,300
You got him.

1234
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:12,509
Who are you?

1235
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:14,720
Thank you.
We're free now, right?

1236
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:18,182
- What?
- Thank you. Thank you.

1237
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:22,937
Anything?

1238
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,521
Nothing.

1239
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:26,023
Oh, fuck.

1240
01:47:33,322 --> 01:47:34,990
What the hell is that?

1241
01:47:51,382 --> 01:47:54,468
I wanna watch your life slip away.

1242
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,984
You fucking cunt!

1243
01:48:11,402 --> 01:48:14,405
Mollie! Mollie!

1244

I asked you for help!

1245
01:48:23,288 --> 01:48:27,459
Bitches like you are the fucking problem!

1246
01:48:44,435 --> 01:48:45,519
Who the...

1247
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,522
Who the hell is that?

1248
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:51,859
Steve's wife.

1249
01:48:54,695 --> 01:48:55,863
What?

1250
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,701
He's married?

1251
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,247
Was... Was married.

1252
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:15,424
I fucking love you, Mollie.

1253
