2
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,834
A son?

3
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,978
I have a son?

4
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,045
Eight pounds.

5
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:40,286
And Sunny? Is she all right?

6
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,317
Shall I make the announcement?

7
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:55,596
It's incredible.

8
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,676
I have a son.

9
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:18,751
He's not the first boy
ever born, you know.

10
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,396
Does he have to be Alexis?
Can't we call him something else?

11
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,926
Alexis was a gentle czar.

12
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,430
Perhaps the only one.

13
00:04:26,635 --> 00:04:28,296
Not counting you.

14
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:31,704
I thought we'd go on
having girls forever.

15
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:34,239
I still can't believe...
Oh, you're dribbling.

16
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,433
Let me.

17
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:40,238
I prayed so hard.

18
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm sure that's how it happened.

19
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:45,352
You heard him cry.

20
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:47,784
Not much.
I'll pinch him, shall I?

21
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,116
He's going to be enormous.

22
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:52,691
Even bigger than your father was.

23
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:56,456
We couldn't call him Alexander,
could we?

24
00:04:56,832 --> 00:05:00,063
He's asleep.
Undoubtedly, we've bored him.

25
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,094
Do you want him for a minute?

26
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:04,932
Not particularly.

27
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,212
I've had a son.

28
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:18,242
For years, I've daydreamed
how I'd feel.

29
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:20,978
And all that time,
I never dreamed...

30
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,992
I'm filled with...
I don't know.

31
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:29,493
It isn't joy or anything like that.
It's more.

32
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:31,666
It's terribly important.

33
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:34,935
And I don't know why you're smiling.

34
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:36,468
<i>Du bist ein Dummkopf.</i>

35
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,538
<i>Du auch.</i>

36
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:47,210
Tegleva, if he wakes up hungry,
bring him back.

37
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,042
Yes, Majesty.

38
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:52,576
At once, no matter what the time is.

39
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:55,750
The dispatches from Port Arthur.
They've been in for hours.

40
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,948
Can't that wait?

41
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,684
I wish it could.

42
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:02,353
The boy will bring us luck.

43
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:06,193
We'll smash the Japanese
and drive them from Korea.

44
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,891
I have a son to fight for now.

45
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:10,496
We have a son.

46
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,438
If you don't get some rest,
he'll starve.

47
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:17,075
Have I made you happy?

48
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:20,608
No, not much.

49
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:26,343
I think I like your gentle czar.

50
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,620
Let's call him Alexis.

51
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,623
I don't like entertaining
with a war on.

52
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,233
Not right somehow.

53
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:44,234
So we've kept it small.
Just family.

54
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:46,171
I can't wait.

55
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,440
Good girl!

56
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:49,809
You'll make a partygoer yet.

57
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:52,275
See you in
Saint Petersburg tonight.

58
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,707
Come on now, Nicky.

59
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:57,475
All right, Uncle.

60
00:06:58,186 --> 00:07:00,086
Who's the sober-looking fellow?

61
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:02,518
Gilliard, the new French tutor.

62
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:03,951
Can't you stay?

63
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,956
- We're seeing Witte.
- That man!

64
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:08,129
- He's a brilliant prime minister.
- I never liked him.

65
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,264
I'm the one he bellows at.

66
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:11,830
You shouldn't let him.

67
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,968
He's your servant.
Everyone's your servant.

68
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:16,927
You're too gentle.

69
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:20,039
You should slam your fist down
as your father always did.

70
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:23,505
It's no use.

71
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,207
Frowning helps.

72
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:28,576
It's baby.

73
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:33,314
Did he have a good night?
Did he miss me?

74
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,054
Come look.

75
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:37,384
I haven't seen him
since last night.

76
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,389
I think he's aged.

77
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:41,721
What's this?

78
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,363
Nothing.

79
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,467
Pull out or I'll
not answer for it!

80
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,070
You must show me
how you do that.

81
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,043
Have I Your Majesty's permission
to review the facts again?

82
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,045
If Port Arthur falls...

83
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,015
No fact begins with "if."

84
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:12,118
Port Arthur has been
under siege for six months.

85
00:08:12,394 --> 00:08:14,624
It has cost us 30,000 dead.

86
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,129
A student stopped me
in the street the other day.

87
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:23,498
"Excuse me, sir, but why
are we at war?"

88
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,605
"Because, my boy, we want Korea...

89
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,866
...but the Japanese will
insist on fighting us for it."

90
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:31,136
"Thank you, sir. But what does
Russia need Korea for?"

91
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:35,510
"Because, my boy, we have
no ice-free port on the Pacific."

92
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:38,117
"I see. In that case, sir,
it isn't good enough."

93
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,753
He's right, sir.

94
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:41,888
It's not good enough at all.

95
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:45,088
Imagine, sire.

96
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,788
Imagine that you
are a factory worker.

97
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:51,898
You're really poor.
Your belly is never full.

98
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,193
You freeze eight months
of the year.

99
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:57,565
Your children have
no school, no doctor.

100
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:00,805
Your country taxes you...

101
00:09:01,576 --> 00:09:03,544
...and sends your sons
a continent away...

102
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:06,805
...to die on a piece of land
on the Pacific.

103
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:11,145
Now, sir, Japan is
a third-rate power.

104
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,688
If she defeats us...

105
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,283
...if Port Arthur falls...

106
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:19,985
...we shall be disgraced
in the eyes of the world...

107
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,720
...and here at home we'll have
an insurrection.

108
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,899
My people love me,
Sergei Julievitch.

109
00:09:25,467 --> 00:09:27,731
They want a constitution...

110
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:31,303
...and the right to vote
for an elected <i>Duma.</i>

111
00:09:31,806 --> 00:09:32,932
They're angry...

112
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:34,608
...and they're serious.

113
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:36,708
Are you advising me to
give my rights away?

114
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:40,340
I am advising you to
stop a hopeless war.

115
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,747
Is it so hopeless, Nikolasha?

116
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:45,544
Well, Nicky...

117
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:47,654
...let me put it this way.

118
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:51,383
Here's a bullet, a bullet
made in St. Petersburg.

119
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:53,353
I send it off to war.

120
00:09:53,561 --> 00:09:54,960
How does it get there?

121
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:57,188
On a single spur of track...

122
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,492
...4000 miles long.

123
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,794
And in the middle,
no track at all.

124
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:07,036
God help it, it spends
three days packed on sleds.

125
00:10:08,076 --> 00:10:11,534
And every boot, shell or
pound of tea we send.

126
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:14,376
Get out now, Nicky...

127
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:16,880
...while there's time.

128
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,951
The Russia my father
gave me never lost a war.

129
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,682
What shall I say to my son
when the time comes?

130
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,522
That I had no pride?

131
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:28,195
That I was weak?

132
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,620
I've always thought...

133
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,360
...God meant me to rule.

134
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:36,528
He put me here.

135
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:40,340
He chose me, and whatever
happens is His will.

136
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:43,469
We shall fight on to victory.

137
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:45,145
There will be no victory.

138
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,371
Only strikes and riots.

139
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:52,316
You must give your people
a little of what they want, sir.

140
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:53,846
Not all...

141
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:55,588
...just a taste.

142
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,519
The English have a parliament.

143
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,319
Our British cousins
gave their rights away.

144
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,689
The Habsburgs and
the Hohenzollerns too.

145
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,660
The Romanovs will not.

146
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,131
What I was given...

147
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:09,269
...I will give my son.

148
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:16,401
These comrades want a larger movement
that will embrace...

149
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:20,741
...all politically-minded people
who can subscribe to a wider dogma.

150
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:22,473
They wish to join hands...

151
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:23,844
Excuse me.

152
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:30,384
May I?

153
00:11:42,837 --> 00:11:45,101
This is my first conference.

154
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,709
- I've been in Siberia.
- So was I.

155
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:53,280
How long?

156
00:11:53,481 --> 00:11:55,711
- I was sentenced to three years.
- So was I.

157
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,545
I only stayed for a month.
I made a run for it.

158
00:12:00,522 --> 00:12:02,956
He wants to introduce himself.

159
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,951
Stalin.

160
00:12:06,127 --> 00:12:07,890
I've inquired about you.

161
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:15,597
Trotsky.

162
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,900
You've been avoiding me.

163
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:21,268
How are you going to vote?

164
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,003
- Against your motion.
- You're a fool!

165
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,236
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:28,013
I can't always do what you tell me.

167
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:33,050
The Romanovs are crowing over
their new heir and the Party's a mess.

168
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,786
- I'll win in spite of you.
- You'll split the Party.

169
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,150
I intend to.

170
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,050
It needs it.

171
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,129
Martov, will you vote for me?

172
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,594
No, against.

173
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:46,762
Come on, Martov.

174
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,168
He doesn't realize what you're doing.
I'm sure you're right.

175
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:55,736
Good.

176
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,377
So you're going to vote for me?

177
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,546
I would, but I'm not a delegate.
I can't vote.

178
00:13:07,155 --> 00:13:08,452
Mr. Lenin.

179
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:14,656
Excuse me, Mr. Lenin.
I'm from the "Socialist Worker."

180
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,990
What do you think of
the Socialist movement in England?

181
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,295
The English cut their meat wrong.
Their tea is terrible.

182
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:25,597
And the weather was better
in Siberia.

183
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:28,298
But you keep your policemen
under control.

184
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:32,603
The vote will now be taken.

185
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,312
Pay attention.

186
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,410
You're about to see
the birth of the Bolshevik Party.

187
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,211
How do you spell that?

188
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,217
I'm going to vote.

189
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,322
Come on, Pankratov.

190
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:47,557
B-O-L-S...

191
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:58,771
Good night, Papa.

192
00:13:58,973 --> 00:13:59,837
Good night, Mama.

193
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,565
Good night, darlings.

194
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,639
I wish we didn't have to go.

195
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,976
- It's Mama's birthday.
- Can't we say I have a headache?

196
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,119
You're just shy.
You're too old for that now.

197
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,792
You enjoy yourself at parties.

198
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,532
I get headaches.

199
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:06,138
If you sat there knowing everyone
disliked you, feeling like a foreigner...

200
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,672
- No one dislikes you.
- Yes, they do.

201
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:12,072
You never see unpleasant things.

202
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,941
You drift away.

203
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,983
I wonder if you
hear me half the time.

204
00:15:17,185 --> 00:15:19,745
Just now I find you
all too audible.

205
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,516
Guess what?

206
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:27,160
You've got your headache.

207
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:43,869
Mother, dear.

208
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:59,785
Not even London on a Sunday is as boring
as a room full of Romanovs.

209
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,928
We see them rarely, Mama.

210
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:04,622
You see everyone rarely.

211
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,562
We'd see more of you
if you traveled less.

212
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:15,636
Witte had tea with me today.

213
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:22,615
He talked about the war,
like everyone else.

214
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:26,810
He ate all my sturgeon, but he
never stopped talking, clever man!

215
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,447
- He thinks...
- I know what he thinks.

216
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,283
He thinks we can't afford wars.

217
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:31,753
It's too ambitious.

218
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,918
We're an 18th century country
in a 20th century world.

219
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,065
We need all our strength and money
to look after Russia.

220
00:16:39,267 --> 00:16:42,202
Don't waste it on those little
yellow Buddhists, or whatever they are.

221
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:47,235
It's a great mistake to get involved
in all these strikes and wars.

222
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:50,076
You only encourage them
by taking them seriously.

223
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:53,008
- Your father always said...
- Thank you for your kind advice.

224
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:54,704
I haven't finished yet, Nicky.

225
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,017
I know I'm not as clever as I
pretend to be, but I'm sure of this:

226
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,347
Get out of Korea
and forget about Japan.

227
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:02,784
I'm 36.

228
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,149
You must let me
look after this war.

229
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:10,687
I'm going to see
if Sunny is all right.

230
00:17:13,434 --> 00:17:16,892
And I suppose everyone
will be expecting me to dance.

231
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,231
Well, I mustn’t disappoint them.

232
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:24,837
I hope it's not too cold for you.

233
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:29,110
Can I get you some champagne?

234
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:30,682
Thank you.

235
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:38,757
Look. There's this fantastic
holy fellow just arrived.

236
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,618
You must meet him.

237
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:43,422
He's a live, authentic <i>starets,</i>
straight from the fields.

238
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:46,456
Cures diseases by
the laying on of hands.

239
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:48,134
I've seen him do it.

240
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,864
Saw this fellow wheeled in...

241
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,302
...legs like pretzels.

242
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,565
Then the <i>starets...</i>

243
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,702
...Gregory Rasputin is his name...

244
00:17:58,045 --> 00:18:00,070
...gave him a deep look...

245
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,406
...touched him...

246
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:03,243
...prayed a bit...

247
00:18:03,684 --> 00:18:07,586
...and up the pretzel popped
and skipped about the room.

248
00:18:08,322 --> 00:18:10,290
A bit grotesquely, I admit...

249
00:18:10,491 --> 00:18:12,550
...but you could tell
he was skipping.

250
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,496
I'll send for him.

251
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:18,858
Must you?

252
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:41,881
<i>Batushka Tsar.</i>

253
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:48,859
<i>Matushka.</i>

254
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,690
Why are you afraid?

255
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:55,469
Why am I what?

256
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,301
I think you're frightened.

257
00:18:57,738 --> 00:19:00,138
Strangers frighten you.

258
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,781
I knew a woman in Prokorvskoe...

259
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:11,376
...that's my home,
a little village in Siberia.

260
00:19:11,852 --> 00:19:13,183
And this woman...

261
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,719
...she was so afraid of strangers...

262
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:19,154
...that she bought herself
a pinewood box and lived in it.

263
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:21,756
Then one day...

264
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,222
...her husband nailed the lid on...

265
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,762
...dug a hole...

266
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:27,400
...and dropped her into it.

267
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,626
"Ivan, don't!" she cried.

268
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:32,904
"But I only want to
make you happy," he said.

269
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:37,373
"I know. But Heavers
full of strangers. Let me out!"

270
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:59,198
Damned barn of a place.

271
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,095
Like an icehouse.

272
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:04,034
Never could stand marble.

273
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:05,930
It gives you rheumatism.

274
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:08,336
Have a drink.

275
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,802
Quite right.

276
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,647
Have some of this vodka.

277
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,710
Keep you warm.

278
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,914
You know, I want to sell
this place or give it away.

279
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:25,558
But no one will be
fool enough to take it.

280
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:29,888
God bless.

281
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:36,795
I started late to be a <i>starets.</i>

282
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:39,139
I was 20 when
this vision came.

283
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:41,600
We peasants get
them all the time.

284
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:44,974
The Virgin comes and tells them...

285
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,613
...when to sell their sheep
if they want to make a profit.

286
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,847
She told me to become a pilgrim.

287
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:52,710
So I started to walk.

288
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:56,949
I waited for her to tell me
when to stop, but she didn't.

289
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,550
I walked 2000 miles...

290
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,585
...and when I got to Greece...

291
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,661
...I couldn't walk any further.
So I stopped.

292
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:07,591
I spent two years
in a monastery...

293
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,531
...and then I walked home again.

294
00:21:09,737 --> 00:21:12,103
Sometimes people say to me...

295
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:15,164
..."What do I need
to become a <i>starets</i>?"

296
00:21:15,376 --> 00:21:17,071
And I say, "Good feet."

297
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,510
Father Gregory...

298
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,449
...do you have visions?

299
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,713
Sometimes.

300
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,348
Why does God send them to you?

301
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,851
God knows. I don't.

302
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,190
I used to be a Lutheran.

303
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:36,158
They take God very seriously.

304
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,388
I take Him as
He comes, <i>Matushka.</i>

305
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,328
When it pleases Him, He uses me.

306
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:43,096
You mean He actually appears?

307
00:21:43,304 --> 00:21:44,202
You see Him?

308
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,202
What's a vision like?

309
00:21:46,774 --> 00:21:48,935
Sometimes it's voices.

310
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,106
Other times, I'm not sure
what I see.

311
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,678
I know exactly what you mean.

312
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:00,114
It happens to me sometimes
when I pray...

313
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:02,488
...especially late at night.

314
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,059
The candles flicker
and it's dark...

315
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,455
...and out of the corner
of my eye, I think I see...

316
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:13,328
I don't know what.

317
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:17,070
And when I turn
to look, it's gone.

318
00:22:22,943 --> 00:22:25,173
You missed the ballet.
It was lovely.

319
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,441
We can leave now, if you like.

320
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:28,876
Already?

321
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,707
But we haven't danced yet.

322
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,080
May I say something intimate?

323
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,144
In public?

324
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,578
I'll whisper it.

325
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,782
Well, if you must.

326
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,814
I adore you.

327
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:29,875
I had such a lovely time.

328
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:33,079
And Father Gregory, I thought
he was delightful, didn't you?

329
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,111
An interesting fellow, I suppose.

330
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:37,876
They tell me in Siberia
the woods are full of them.

331
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:10,574
The Tsarevitch's bruise
worried me.

332
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:12,445
I made some tests.

333
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,180
I wasn't sure.
I'm not a specialist.

334
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,949
But I'm afraid
these gentleman concur.

335
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:20,922
There is no doubt of it?

336
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:23,920
No doubt of any kind?

337
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:25,959
It is unquestionably hemophilia.

338
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:28,733
I see.

339
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:34,140
Excuse me, but it
takes a moment to absorb.

340
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,067
And what's the treatment?

341
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:39,776
Nothing, sire.

342
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,617
That's not possible.
There must be medicines.

343
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,008
There are no medicines.

344
00:24:47,021 --> 00:24:48,283
Nothing at all?

345
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:50,445
I see.

346
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,820
The female is the carrier.

347
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,790
The mother gives
it to the son.

348
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:57,190
Your mother got it
from her mother, Queen Victoria...

349
00:24:57,564 --> 00:24:59,259
...and passed it on to you.

350
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,295
It strikes some males
and misses others.

351
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:04,664
Of Victoria's four sons,
just one had hemophilia.

352
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,070
And just one of mine.

353
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,166
Some hemophiliacs grow up to lead...

354
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,033
...quite long and normal lives.

355
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:12,337
And some do not.

356
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:15,181
The chemical that makes
the blood clot is missing.

357
00:25:15,382 --> 00:25:17,782
When he cuts himself,
he bleeds extensively.

358
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:20,283
Then we'll see to it that Alexis
does not cut himself.

359
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,352
It's more than that.
A surface wound...

360
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:23,614
Let me.

361
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,356
They tell me cuts
don't matter much.

362
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:32,257
They tell me if Alexis cuts
his hand, they tie it very tight...

363
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,900
...and after a little while
the bleeding stops.

364
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:36,228
It's when he bleeds inside...

365
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:37,267
Inside?

366
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:39,905
They tell me any bump
can make him bleed inside.

367
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,096
One never knows.

368
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,473
An awful blow may
do no harm at all...

369
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,168
...and then again,
a tiny tap and it begins.

370
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:50,210
They tell me the blood seeps slowly,
sometimes going on for days.

371
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,580
They tell me the area begins to swell,
fills up like a balloon...

372
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:56,445
...until the pressure is
so great the bleeding stops.

373
00:25:56,657 --> 00:25:59,387
Then, while the swelling lasts,
the blood attacks the bone...

374
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:02,187
It can leave a limb
all bent and twisted.

375
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:04,931
While this is going on,
there's nothing they can do.

376
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,226
That's what they tell me.

377
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,566
Tell them...

378
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:14,637
Tell them they are mistaken.

379
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:18,200
Tell them we shall
go to other doctors.

380
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,210
Tell them to get out.

381
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,475
My son is perfect.

382
00:26:25,185 --> 00:26:27,085
He will have a long life...

383
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,619
...and grow up
to be a great Tsar...

384
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:31,222
...like his father.

385
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:36,927
More troops! He's going to
send more men to die!

386
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,495
Port Arthur falls and
Nicholas is sending more men!

387
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,200
I say we students...

388
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:45,936
...lead the way!

389
00:26:46,673 --> 00:26:50,074
I say we give him
a Port Arthur here!

390
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:52,076
I say we mobilize...

391
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,072
They're coming for us!

392
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,278
Now, do we run or do we fight?

393
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,844
We fight!

394
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,528
This way, Father! Hurry!

395
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,907
It's all over, Petya.

396
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,406
She's dead.

397
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:43,021
She lived her life
here in this place.

398
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,557
She got married.

399
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,759
I was born. Father died.

400
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,562
My eldest son is playing...

401
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,407
...here in this place...

402
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,704
...and they go on working.

403
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,669
Why not? They have to live.

404
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,378
I work when they die.

405
00:28:01,949 --> 00:28:03,382
Let me hold him.

406
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,952
I want to kill somebody.

407
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:19,589
They come here sometimes...

408
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,264
...the other factory workers...

409
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,534
...and they tell us...

410
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,373
...that we should
burn things down.

411
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:29,705
Make bombs.

412
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:34,614
Well, I want to fight back...

413
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:35,876
...once!

414
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:40,351
All violence begets is violence.
They'll beat you.

415
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,715
There's a better way.

416
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,282
We are going to see the Tsar.

417
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,827
You know what they say, Father:

418
00:28:48,262 --> 00:28:50,890
God is too high
and the Tsar's too far away.

419
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:53,899
The Tsar is here in Petersburg
to bless the troops.

420
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,997
He's staying at the Winter Palace.

421
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,895
Thousands of us will march
there on Sunday morning.

422
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,464
I'll go to him on the balcony...

423
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,900
...and read this:

424
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:05,309
"Sire...

425
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,239
...we working men and
inhabitants of St. Petersburg...

426
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:10,207
...come to you, sire,
to seek...

427
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,348
...for truth, justice
and protection.

428
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:16,253
Only you can
hear our prayers.

429
00:29:16,623 --> 00:29:18,022
And if you do not...

430
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:19,450
...we shall die...

431
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,028
...here on this square...

432
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,261
...before your palace."

433
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:41,444
God is with you.

434
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,842
St. George will guard you.

435
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,226
St. George will guard you.

436
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:56,528
<i>Batushka Tsar.</i>

437
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,564
Come on, my friend.

438
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:03,027
Stand up.

439
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:17,477
It's beautiful to watch them.

440
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:18,646
Bless you.

441
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:33,361
We must get back
to Tsarkoe Selo.

442
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:38,365
I've ordered the train already
and I'll cancel all the engagements.

443
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:39,706
Vladimir, what is it?

444
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,569
A message from Botkin.

445
00:30:43,644 --> 00:30:45,168
The Tsarevitch is bleeding.

446
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:46,546
Oh, my God!

447
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,109
How long before
our train comes?

448
00:30:52,786 --> 00:30:53,912
I don't know.

449
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:55,385
Perhaps half an hour.

450
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:56,786
I want to go.

451
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:58,588
We will. We will.

452
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,517
Now! Nicky, take me home.

453
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,384
The train's the fastest way.
We must wait.

454
00:31:02,763 --> 00:31:05,527
I can't! My baby's bleeding.
I'm in Petersburg.

455
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,457
He needs me. Half an hour!

456
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,128
God, save my little boy!

457
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,470
Sunny, stop!

458
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:13,271
Take me away.
I want my baby. Let me go!

459
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,068
You bless them.

460
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,535
Think of the soldiers.
Think of the war, the weather.

461
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:19,469
Think of anything,
but not baby.

462
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,040
I can't!

463
00:31:22,616 --> 00:31:23,446
Do it.

464
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:30,382
God is good.

465
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,024
Believe in His mercy.

466
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:36,792
He will not punish
the pure in heart.

467
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:38,496
Believe in His mercy.

468
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,089
Well...

469
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,566
What if the bleeding
doesn't stop?

470
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:25,596
It must.

471
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,535
Botkin doesn't
think Alexis will...

472
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:31,707
Die.

473
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:33,104
Thank God.

474
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,777
It isn't much to
thank Him for.

475
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:35,842
Botkin said...

476
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:38,707
What do doctors know?
They're useless.

477
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,652
It's in God's hands.

478
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,217
Submit, submit!

479
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:45,819
You should have been a monk.

480
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,182
Won't you ever fight?

481
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,585
I can't fight you.

482
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,255
My baby's dying.

483
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,928
There are no medicines.
Christ Jesus!

484
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,093
Don't come near me.

485
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,262
<i>Matushka.</i>

486
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,198
I can't seem to
get them right.

487
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,336
<i>Matushka,</i> tell me what it is.

488
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,005
I keep thinking
the arrangement matters.

489
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,904
I can't even remember
which saints they are.

490
00:34:42,282 --> 00:34:44,750
It doesn't matter.
They know you.

491
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,420
I knew all their names once.

492
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:48,818
I had to.

493
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:52,553
To marry Nicky,
I had to change my faith.

494
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,917
That was a great sin,
don't you think?

495
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:56,592
God thinks so.

496
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:58,624
He won't hear me when I pray.

497
00:34:58,999 --> 00:34:59,829
I've sinned...

498
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,599
...and he won't listen.

499
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:03,902
All saints were sinners once.

500
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:06,239
God loves sinners.

501
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:09,671
Then why is he killing my baby?

502
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:13,505
We had a man in Prokorvskoe.

503
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,814
He didn't wash or work.

504
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:19,549
He lied, stole, cheated, drank...

505
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,353
...chased all the women.

506
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,120
He was a sinner.

507
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,721
Why, out of all men,
did the Virgin come to him?

508
00:35:28,695 --> 00:35:30,287
Perhaps he lied.

509
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,222
You said he was a liar.

510
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:35,066
She came.

511
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,168
I saw her.

512
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:40,637
I know all there is
to know about sin.

513
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,666
Pray with me, <i>Matushka.</i>

514
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,677
God is here.

515
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,246
I can't.

516
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,152
That's my punishment.

517
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:56,813
I shouldn't have sent for you.

518
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,953
I don't know you at all.

519
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,617
If baby wakes, he'll need me.

520
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:02,960
Goodbye.

521
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:07,359
The child will die...

522
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:11,368
...if you don't get down on
your knees and beg for his life...

523
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:15,071
...like a peasant begging
for crusts at your door.

524
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:17,906
You will be taken
back to St. Petersburg.

525
00:36:18,278 --> 00:36:19,370
Wait outside.

526
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,805
I knew you were
going to send for me.

527
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:25,413
I knew the child was sick.
I know what's the matter with him.

528
00:36:27,787 --> 00:36:28,776
You can't!

529
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:32,022
I see blood when
I shut my eyes.

530
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:34,318
A lot of blood.

531
00:36:35,996 --> 00:36:37,463
I saw blood once before...

532
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:39,560
...when I was in Jerusalem.

533
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,059
And then my father died.

534
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:47,436
In Kazan, there's an
ivory Christ, and the wounds bleed.

535
00:36:48,008 --> 00:36:52,672
Someone told me there's a Madonna
in Kharkov that sheds real tears.

536
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,709
<i>Matushka.</i>

537
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,609
I see things.

538
00:36:58,184 --> 00:36:59,549
I have power!

539
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:02,150
I cure the sick.

540
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:06,554
Holy men kneel to me
and kiss my hands.

541
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,986
I am a vessel of the Lord.

542
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,055
I have spoken with God.

543
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,132
It must be so.

544
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,435
How else can I
do these things?

545
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:19,101
I save souls and bring peace.

546
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:21,464
God leads me.

547
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,170
He brought me here.

548
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:25,135
He speaks through me.

549
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:27,673
I am the voice of God.

550
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,447
It is His will.

551
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:33,013
<i>I have been sent</i>
<i>to do great things.</i>

552
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:50,796
Your Majesty.

553
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:52,323
Baby's better.

554
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:56,455
Go back!

555
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,293
Stop!

556
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:00,997
We come in peace!

557
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,560
We come to see our Tsar!

558
00:40:04,504 --> 00:40:06,802
We come in peace!

559
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:08,867
Go back!

560
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:12,541
We come to see our father!
Peace! Peace!

561
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,581
High angle!

562
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:20,744
Fire!

563
00:40:57,824 --> 00:41:00,019
Slaughtered like cattle!

564
00:41:01,694 --> 00:41:02,626
He didn't come.

565
00:41:04,664 --> 00:41:05,892
He never came.

566
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,435
Nicholas, the murderer.

567
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,773
The bloody, bloody murderer.

568
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:26,617
Mama!

569
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:44,565
- Why wasn't I told?
- Your Majesty.

570
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:47,137
Who gave the order?
How did it happen?

571
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,171
- Why wasn't I told?
- As I understand it...

572
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:50,740
How many dead?
Who ordered the shooting?

573
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:54,238
Hundreds of bodies.
Nobody ordered it.

574
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,013
Someone's responsible.
You run this government.

575
00:41:59,118 --> 00:42:01,211
This came last night.

576
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,352
It reads:

577
00:42:03,556 --> 00:42:05,114
"Sire, we working men..."

578
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,987
Answer me!
How many were killed?

579
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,355
I don't know yet,
certainly hundreds.

580
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:12,087
Why wasn't I told
they were marching?

581
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:15,194
- Would you have met them?
- How could I?

582
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:16,959
Would you have
given them a Duma?

583
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,364
Elections? Schools?

584
00:42:18,805 --> 00:42:20,898
Why bother to inform you?
You wouldn't have done anything!

585
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:23,468
- I want a good life for my people.
- On your terms.

586
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:25,644
I know what will
make them happy.

587
00:42:25,845 --> 00:42:29,076
They're children and they need a Tsar.
They need tradition, not this.

588
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:31,506
They're the victims of agitators.

589
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:34,915
A Duma would make them
bewildered and discontented.

590
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:37,118
And don't tell me
about London and Berlin!

591
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:38,517
God save us from
the mess they're in.

592
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:40,256
I see.

593
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:44,192
So, they talk, pray, march, plead...

594
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:48,493
...petition and what do they get?
Cossacks, prison, flogging, police!

595
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:50,896
And now, after today,
they will be shot!

596
00:42:51,104 --> 00:42:52,935
Is this God's will?

597
00:42:53,373 --> 00:42:54,965
Are these His methods?

598
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:56,998
Make war on
your own people.

599
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,236
How long do you think they'll
stand and let you shoot them?

600
00:43:00,446 --> 00:43:02,778
You ask me who's responsible!

601
00:43:02,982 --> 00:43:04,779
You ask!

602
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:08,284
Russia will explode!
A massacre in Petersburg!

603
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:11,485
Now the Japanese have forced Nicholas
to accept peace on their terms.

604
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:13,414
He's lost the war!

605
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:16,253
Thousands of soldiers killed,
and all for nothing.

606
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:19,124
This time Nicholas
has destroyed himself.

607
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:21,129
I'm going to Petersburg!

608
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:24,235
But you'll need bombs
and explosives and ammunition.

609
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:25,665
They can be smuggled in, Leon.

610
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:27,806
For God's sake, don't
discuss that with her!

611
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:30,305
She probably thinks you can
wheel machine guns...

612
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,603
...across the frontier
in a baby carriage.

613
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:35,313
Who wrote this
extraordinary rubbish?

614
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,474
You're not going to print it?

615
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,211
I was going to speak
to you about it first.

616
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,513
This must be some of
your nonsense, Trotsky.

617
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:44,889
"Lenin's theory comes to this:

618
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,025
The Party decides
what the people think.

619
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:49,194
An elite decides
what the Party thinks.

620
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:51,522
The Central Committee decides
what the elite thinks.

621
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:54,489
And Lenin decides
what they all think."

622
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:57,233
You will print it?

623
00:43:57,603 --> 00:43:58,695
I can't.

624
00:43:59,505 --> 00:44:01,268
The style's atrocious.

625
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,840
I'll never understand you.

626
00:44:05,044 --> 00:44:07,012
You hate anyone who's not your
kind of Bolshevik...

627
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:08,475
...more than you hate the Tsar.

628
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:10,672
No wonder they
call you Robespierre.

629
00:44:10,883 --> 00:44:13,181
Everybody's got to think
like you or they're out.

630
00:44:13,386 --> 00:44:16,844
He thinks freedom is something you
write on a wall but don't practice.

631
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:17,988
That's not true.

632
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:21,726
Of course I agree you're
free to say what you like.

633
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:24,325
You must agree I'm free
to shoot you for saying it.

634
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,825
Murder, arson, terror.

635
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,962
I'll agree to anything
that gives us power.

636
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:31,295
Power!

637
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,671
And we can't have power
if we compromise.

638
00:44:35,241 --> 00:44:36,469
Even though it takes years.

639
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:39,104
Terror and power!

640
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:24,356
Be careful!

641
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:25,854
Are you all right, Alexei?

642
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:29,121
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run
and mustn’t play!

643
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:30,659
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.

644
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:32,421
Must be careful all the time.

645
00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:37,833
You must try to understand.

646
00:45:38,471 --> 00:45:39,995
Your mother worries.

647
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:41,673
We both do.

648
00:45:43,276 --> 00:45:45,107
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run...

649
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:47,374
...and mustn’t play!
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.

650
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,241
Must be careful all the time.

651
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:50,910
I found some mushrooms.

652
00:45:51,117 --> 00:45:54,575
Father wouldn't let me pick them.
He said they were poisonous.

653
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:57,751
They were green.
I'm hungry.

654
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:01,953
All you ever serve
is bread and butter.

655
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,389
It's tradition.

656
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:05,693
I'll do better in the kitchen.

657
00:46:05,898 --> 00:46:08,958
Nagorny, don't let him
run too fast!

658
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:12,067
He's always happy here at Livadia.

659
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:13,568
The Crimea's good for him.

660
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:15,104
It's good for all of us.

661
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:17,469
- Some tea?
- One cup.

662
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,008
Before Stolypin comes,
I'd like to play a little tennis.

663
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:22,771
We have so few days here.

664
00:46:22,982 --> 00:46:24,779
Can't your ministers
leave us alone?

665
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:25,951
You used to like him.

666
00:46:26,385 --> 00:46:28,148
For my sake, be as
gracious as you can.

667
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:30,853
He's not a good man.
He's against us.

668
00:46:31,624 --> 00:46:34,320
Nonsense.
He's a great prime minister.

669
00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:38,262
I sent Father Gregory
to see him.

670
00:46:39,732 --> 00:46:41,427
You sent Rasputin?

671
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:43,527
What in God's name for?

672
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:46,597
Our friend reads
people's hearts.

673
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,330
He knows who loves us
and who doesn't.

674
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:50,372
He can tell.

675
00:46:50,843 --> 00:46:53,073
Stolypin is a bad man.

676
00:46:53,512 --> 00:46:56,276
In future, may I ask you, please...

677
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,680
I don't care if he
talks to God or not...

678
00:47:00,886 --> 00:47:02,114
...Rasputin is a peasant!

679
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:05,686
Is my judgment so inadequate?

680
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:08,552
Am I too dense to tell
a statesman when I see one?

681
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:09,693
What on earth...

682
00:47:19,372 --> 00:47:22,170
Stolypin, you look terrible.
Here's what we'll do.

683
00:47:33,653 --> 00:47:35,086
Peter Arkadiavitch!

684
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:37,686
Only you could wear a briefcase
with a bathing suit.

685
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:40,359
I think I'd feel
naked without it.

686
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,993
Besides, I must have
somewhere to put my lifebelt.

687
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:59,844
What you've done for Russia since
Witte's retirement is a miracle.

688
00:48:00,046 --> 00:48:03,140
Or a mirage.
Russia's too large.

689
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:05,283
It's impossible to govern.

690
00:48:05,584 --> 00:48:07,176
I'm not what holds it
all together.

691
00:48:07,386 --> 00:48:08,478
You are.

692
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:11,851
Which is why the Tercentenary
next month is so important to us.

693
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,384
Final schedule is pending
your approval.

694
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:17,261
I'm afraid the tour
is long and taxing.

695
00:48:17,463 --> 00:48:19,260
But it's critical
that people...

696
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:21,797
...feel the dynasty is
permanent and strong.

697
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:24,699
Three hundred years of Romanovs.

698
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:27,032
That fact is vital to us.

699
00:48:27,473 --> 00:48:29,373
- It implies, first of all...
- Come on, Peter.

700
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:30,906
Out with it.

701
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:33,469
We leave for Petersburg tomorrow.

702
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,409
What's so urgent that it
brings you all this way?

703
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:40,442
One finds these everywhere.

704
00:48:41,287 --> 00:48:43,118
All over Petersburg.

705
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,513
The printing is poor...

706
00:48:45,725 --> 00:48:47,158
...but the thought is clear.

707
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:50,789
What's wrong with the Okrana?

708
00:48:51,163 --> 00:48:54,655
Can't 10,000 secret agents
find a printing press?

709
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:57,396
They can't find all of them.

710
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,164
I want it stopped.

711
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:01,805
It's too late. They plan to
debate it in the <i>Duma.</i>

712
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:03,268
Damn the <i>Duma</i>!

713
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:04,602
Witte's work.

714
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,675
He made me give it
to the people.

715
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,209
Close it. Shut it down.

716
00:49:09,415 --> 00:49:11,747
I don't like the <i>Duma</i>
any more than you do.

717
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:15,316
But I'd rather they talk
than riot, strike and march.

718
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:17,489
Better to give them
more power than face that.

719
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,588
I am the Tsar.

720
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:21,854
And I would never accept that.

721
00:49:24,864 --> 00:49:26,388
Police reports...

722
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:29,032
...on Gregory Efimovitch Rasputin.

723
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:30,830
Drunk half the time.

724
00:49:31,036 --> 00:49:32,663
Whores, generals' wives...

725
00:49:32,872 --> 00:49:34,669
He's generous with himself.
I'll say that.

726
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:36,904
That's his only Christian virtue.

727
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:40,340
He'll sleep with anyone.
It's no secret, everybody knows it.

728
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,872
He came to see me.

729
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:44,777
Apparently with
Her Majesty's blessing.

730
00:49:45,151 --> 00:49:46,948
He even tried to hypnotize me.

731
00:49:47,153 --> 00:49:48,814
Why is such a man
admitted to the palace?

732
00:49:49,021 --> 00:49:51,148
- You know why.
- Your people don't.

733
00:49:51,357 --> 00:49:52,847
I'll tell them, shall I?

734
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:56,994
Citizens, your Tsarevitch could
get a bloody nose and die from it.

735
00:49:57,296 --> 00:49:59,230
You must send him
away from Petersburg.

736
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:00,363
How can I?

737
00:50:00,566 --> 00:50:02,363
People think he violates
your daughters and wife!

738
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:06,070
Get him out! I can't control
the situation if you don't.

739
00:50:06,272 --> 00:50:07,671
And if I do?

740
00:50:07,873 --> 00:50:08,703
What happens if...

741
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:36,927
Your Highness!

742
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:39,070
It's all right, Nagorny.

743
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:40,861
You'll always save me.

744
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,274
It's all Nagorny's fault.

745
00:50:51,517 --> 00:50:54,281
Botkin warned us Alexis
would behave like this.

746
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:57,046
It's a typical reaction.
It's even got a name.

747
00:50:57,256 --> 00:50:58,814
I don't care.

748
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:01,425
A sailor for a nurse.

749
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,489
It's an absurd idea.

750
00:51:03,762 --> 00:51:05,024
It's mine.

751
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:19,275
I still say Alexei needs a nurse.

752
00:51:19,478 --> 00:51:21,207
He needs the company of men.

753
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:22,380
Does he?

754
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,880
He's with you all day long.
You hardly ever come to meals.

755
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:28,646
I never seem to see you anymore.

756
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:32,914
My place is where I'm needed most.

757
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:36,753
It must be hard to have
so many people need you.

758
00:51:37,363 --> 00:51:38,728
I'll be patient.

759
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:40,860
If I wait, my turn will come.

760
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:47,805
What a mess I make of things.

761
00:51:49,008 --> 00:51:51,203
I meant to look so nice for you.

762
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:54,679
I meant our last night in Livadia
to be beautiful.

763
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:12,162
Sometimes I wonder
how you live with me.

764
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:14,091
I wonder too.

765
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,198
Only I know I could never
live without you.

766
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:32,783
My decision stands.

767
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:35,915
I've seen you out of courtesy.

768
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:39,917
- If you've come here to plead...
- I came to say goodbye.

769
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,751
I'm going home.

770
00:52:43,796 --> 00:52:46,060
I don't like St. Petersburg.

771
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:48,762
It makes me drink too much.

772
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:50,663
And when I drink...

773
00:52:51,904 --> 00:52:53,371
...the women come.

774
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:58,074
The women here are worse
than the peasants in my village.

775
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:00,275
They've no restraint.

776
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:04,777
Is <i>Matushka</i> angry with me?

777
00:53:06,118 --> 00:53:09,246
She won't admit you even
take a drink, much less...

778
00:53:10,556 --> 00:53:11,386
No.

779
00:53:12,324 --> 00:53:14,121
She believes in you completely.

780
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:15,816
She is a saint.

781
00:53:17,796 --> 00:53:19,058
<i>Matushka...</i>

782
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:21,159
...if you need me
while I am gone...

783
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,130
...pretend I'm with you.

784
00:53:23,335 --> 00:53:26,827
Say the things that trouble you,
as you always do, and it will help.

785
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:29,637
I only sit and listen anyway.

786
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:33,042
The voice of God is in you...

787
00:53:33,479 --> 00:53:35,538
...and no harm will come.

788
00:53:50,496 --> 00:53:52,020
It was necessary.

789
00:53:52,598 --> 00:53:53,496
Why?

790
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:55,599
Stolypin recommended it.

791
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:57,598
Our friend warned me he was bad.

792
00:53:57,803 --> 00:54:01,102
Rasputin drinks, takes bribes.
He is an adulterer.

793
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:02,364
He is a saint.

794
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:03,802
Little men always abuse them.

795
00:54:04,009 --> 00:54:05,408
I can show you
the police reports.

796
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:06,475
More little men.

797
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,168
People say he sleeps with you.

798
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:09,745
What do I care
what people think?

799
00:54:09,948 --> 00:54:11,176
I have to care!

800
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:12,748
I want him.

801
00:54:12,985 --> 00:54:14,350
- Bring him back.
- I can't.

802
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:16,282
- Can't you do anything?
- I am.

803
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,456
I'm standing up to you for once.

804
00:54:18,657 --> 00:54:20,147
Who's going to save Alexei?

805
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:21,348
We have doctors.

806
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,084
Damn your doctors!
What about my son?

807
00:54:23,295 --> 00:54:24,728
I've other important things
to answer for.

808
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:27,091
I don't.
Give me Rasputin back!

809
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,529
No, I will not.

810
00:54:28,867 --> 00:54:30,027
If baby dies, you murdered him!

811
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:31,528
I didn't give him hemophilia.

812
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:32,996
Murderer!

813
00:54:33,305 --> 00:54:36,069
- I'll never forgive you.
- You gave it to him! It was you!

814
00:54:36,442 --> 00:54:38,672
Don't you think I know it?

815
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,883
When I see him bleed...

816
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:48,778
...I think I did it...

817
00:54:49,588 --> 00:54:51,818
...as if I'd put a knife in him.

818
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:55,487
I've tried to make up for it.

819
00:54:56,862 --> 00:55:00,855
I've seen so many specialists
and doctors and surgeons.

820
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,559
Sometimes I did not tell you.

821
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:06,900
I know most of them
were quacks...

822
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:10,099
...but I still tried.

823
00:55:12,244 --> 00:55:14,974
I have spent nights
on my knees...

824
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,247
...praying.

825
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:20,547
And Rasputin's the only one...

826
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:23,548
...who has helped me
bear my punishment.

827
00:55:25,724 --> 00:55:29,854
That's why I cling to this
common peasant from Siberia.

828
00:55:32,564 --> 00:55:34,725
They laugh at me
in the streets.

829
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,599
You have turned against me.

830
00:55:39,338 --> 00:55:41,272
But I cannot help it.

831
00:55:42,174 --> 00:55:43,334
It's me.

832
00:55:44,143 --> 00:55:46,839
Whatever happens, I deserve it.

833
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:49,143
It's my punishment.

834
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:51,310
It's mine.

835
00:55:56,955 --> 00:55:59,753
Stalin's been sentenced
to Siberia again.

836
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:00,992
What else?

837
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:05,822
The Okrana's infiltrated
our cells in Moscow.

838
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:10,664
They found all our
explosives in Minsk.

839
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:12,166
Perhaps I should
go back to Petersburg.

840
00:56:12,905 --> 00:56:14,532
You didn't do
much good last time.

841
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:16,806
What else is happening?

842
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:20,604
Not much. Not since Rasputin
went back to Siberia.

843
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:21,904
Yes, it's a pity.

844
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:23,877
He can't cause
much trouble there.

845
00:56:24,216 --> 00:56:27,617
He was worth more than an army
of Bolsheviks in Petersburg.

846
00:56:28,487 --> 00:56:31,183
They've arrested
Sverdilov in Kiev.

847
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,716
Spies everywhere.

848
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:37,222
No one trusts anyone.

849
00:56:39,364 --> 00:56:43,061
Some of our party leaders
work for the Okrana.

850
00:56:49,074 --> 00:56:52,532
I see you were in the Minsk group
when it was raided.

851
00:56:53,812 --> 00:56:55,006
You got away?

852
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:57,404
I managed to hide.

853
00:56:57,683 --> 00:56:59,548
And all the others
were caught?

854
00:57:02,287 --> 00:57:04,152
You got somewhere to live?

855
00:57:04,523 --> 00:57:06,320
Not five minutes away from here.

856
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,626
Good.

857
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,919
Thank you for bringing the message.

858
00:57:11,363 --> 00:57:13,126
Come and see us again soon.

859
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,657
And don't drink.

860
00:57:14,866 --> 00:57:17,528
Too many of our men
take to drink in Paris.

861
00:57:20,038 --> 00:57:22,165
If Sverdilov's been arrested...

862
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:24,633
He's a double agent.

863
00:57:25,277 --> 00:57:26,539
He works for the Okrana.

864
00:57:32,618 --> 00:57:33,550
Go home.

865
00:57:33,752 --> 00:57:35,344
I don't feel like
talking tonight.

866
00:57:35,554 --> 00:57:37,078
I've got nothing to say.

867
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,889
We've got old.

868
00:57:51,303 --> 00:57:52,361
They've gone?

869
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:54,138
I'll get your supper.

870
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:56,705
That's all right.
There's no hurry.

871
00:57:58,076 --> 00:58:00,806
In the last ten years,
I've spent...

872
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:03,842
...three months in Russia.

873
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:09,143
I'm out of fashion.

874
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:12,616
No one's wearing me this year.

875
00:58:13,892 --> 00:58:14,950
I talk...

876
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,551
...and no one listens.
I write...

877
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,691
...and no one reads.

878
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:25,059
Think what we'll be like
in 10 or 15 years.

879
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:28,935
Emigrés go off their heads
in the end, you know.

880
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:35,537
Mad, old cranks with no money,
no country...

881
00:58:35,747 --> 00:58:38,011
...always worrying
about the laundry...

882
00:58:38,216 --> 00:58:40,616
...complaining when
the mail's late.

883
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:44,013
Being ill in charity hospitals
and buried with the paupers.

884
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:45,849
No, Ilyich.

885
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:48,083
It won't be like that.

886
00:58:48,293 --> 00:58:50,625
Three hundred years
of Romanovs?

887
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:54,926
Why not 300 more?

888
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:22,349
Long live the Romanovs!

889
00:59:26,064 --> 00:59:28,624
Three hundred years!

890
00:59:44,616 --> 00:59:46,413
Come on! Come on!

891
01:00:10,175 --> 01:00:13,941
I didn't want to come on this
Tercentenary tour, Peter Arkadiavitch.

892
01:00:15,313 --> 01:00:18,680
But, God help me, I do love it
when they stand and wave.

893
01:01:15,407 --> 01:01:16,237
He's shot!

894
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:24,849
Guards! Guards!
For God's sake, hurry!

895
01:01:45,504 --> 01:01:46,835
What's to be done?

896
01:01:51,576 --> 01:01:52,736
Is he dead?

897
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:53,841
No.

898
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:56,672
There's a lot of blood, pain.

899
01:01:57,616 --> 01:01:59,243
The doctors are with him.

900
01:02:00,118 --> 01:02:01,107
Good.

901
01:02:03,955 --> 01:02:05,252
He's a good man.

902
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:09,022
They always kill the good men.

903
01:02:09,694 --> 01:02:11,685
The ones who help them most.

904
01:02:12,998 --> 01:02:14,829
They killed my grandfather.

905
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,334
He freed the serfs, you know.

906
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:20,335
He helped them.
So they threw a bomb.

907
01:02:22,707 --> 01:02:24,368
Stolypin's a good man.

908
01:02:28,313 --> 01:02:29,746
I can't find a match.

909
01:02:31,116 --> 01:02:33,107
They've got the man
who shot him.

910
01:02:33,318 --> 01:02:34,307
The man?

911
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:37,179
Some kind of revolutionary.

912
01:02:39,791 --> 01:02:41,258
Damn them all.

913
01:02:42,494 --> 01:02:44,826
You help them and they
kill you for it.

914
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,894
Give them <i>Dumas</i>
and they give you bombs.

915
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:51,662
I want them paid in kind.

916
01:02:52,771 --> 01:02:54,238
You understand me?

917
01:02:54,873 --> 01:02:56,534
I want something done!

918
01:02:59,544 --> 01:03:01,671
You bastard!

919
01:03:02,814 --> 01:03:03,644
This is our home!

920
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:04,780
Not anymore!

921
01:03:04,983 --> 01:03:05,847
We live here!

922
01:03:10,155 --> 01:03:11,383
Arrest him.

923
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:29,634
Tell the Tsar that
he can close this building...

924
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:32,401
...but the <i>Duma</i> won't be closed.

925
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:38,972
That's enough, Mr. Kerensky.

926
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:41,675
No, it's not, Mr. Prime Minister.

927
01:03:41,886 --> 01:03:45,652
You cannot repress this body
and you cannot repress the people.

928
01:03:45,857 --> 01:03:48,325
That's the road to revolution.

929
01:03:48,793 --> 01:03:51,523
We're not revolutionaries here.

930
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,056
Most of us want a system
like the British.

931
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:56,961
Let there be a Tsar...

932
01:03:57,168 --> 01:04:00,296
...but let there be a parliament
with rights and powers.

933
01:04:00,505 --> 01:04:02,564
We won't be denied,
Mr. Kokovtsov.

934
01:04:02,774 --> 01:04:05,937
This government deplores
brutality and violence.

935
01:04:06,144 --> 01:04:08,009
But when dissent
gets out of hand...

936
01:04:08,213 --> 01:04:10,738
...when opposition ceases
to be peaceful...

937
01:04:10,949 --> 01:04:13,782
...law and order
must and will be kept.

938
01:04:14,019 --> 01:04:16,249
Not at this price!

939
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:18,920
The <i>Duma</i> is not a street corner.

940
01:04:19,157 --> 01:04:21,318
There is no violence here.

941
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,552
But even we are not free to speak.

942
01:04:23,762 --> 01:04:25,286
Where is the Tsar?

943
01:04:25,997 --> 01:04:28,124
The Tsar is at the
hunting lodge in Poland.

944
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:31,734
I don't care if he's
in Scotland shooting grouse!

945
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:35,504
Find him and tell him he's
bringing ruin on his head!

946
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:37,675
Tell him while there's
still a Tsar to tell!

947
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:53,788
You all right?

948
01:04:55,427 --> 01:04:58,191
Alexei, Alexei, mustn’t run
and mustn’t play!

949
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,996
Mustn’t jump and mustn’t climb.

950
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:05,399
- You must be more careful.
- It was nothing.

951
01:05:05,837 --> 01:05:08,499
I will run away and
be an actress when I grow up.

952
01:05:08,707 --> 01:05:09,799
It's my destiny.

953
01:05:10,175 --> 01:05:13,872
Once you've felt the call
of the stage, you know.

954
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,478
It's in your blood.

955
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:21,616
A princess can't be an actress.

956
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,118
You may well say
you want to be a trollop.

957
01:05:24,322 --> 01:05:25,983
What's a trollop?

958
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:28,290
Trollop.
Yes, that sounds nice.

959
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:30,324
Perhaps I'll be a trollop instead.

960
01:05:30,528 --> 01:05:33,429
Monsieur Gilliard,
what's French for trollop?

961
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,801
I'll marry a prince
and have eight children.

962
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:41,995
Ten, if he's really nice.

963
01:05:42,574 --> 01:05:44,337
How many will you have, Olga?

964
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,237
What's the use in daydreaming?

965
01:05:47,145 --> 01:05:50,171
I should like to be a teacher
when I grow up.

966
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:53,350
Teaching is such a noble profession.

967
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:56,916
That's Monsieur Gilliard!

968
01:05:57,989 --> 01:06:00,082
Do you think I've caught his eyes?

969
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:01,690
Monsieur Gilliard...

970
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,087
...how do you say smouldering
in French?

971
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:11,793
You silly, stupid child!

972
01:06:30,388 --> 01:06:31,446
Think of it.

973
01:06:32,857 --> 01:06:35,451
Russian princesses performing
an English play in French...

974
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,685
...for an audience
of Polish nobles.

975
01:06:38,396 --> 01:06:40,421
I hope somebody understands it.

976
01:06:41,766 --> 01:06:43,734
At least we have
the day to ourselves.

977
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:45,067
Mother...

978
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,667
...I'm bleeding.

979
01:06:47,138 --> 01:06:48,298
Dear God!

980
01:06:51,709 --> 01:06:53,233
How far is it back to Spala?

981
01:06:53,578 --> 01:06:54,545
Two or three miles.

982
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,043
As fast as you can go!

983
01:07:27,579 --> 01:07:28,477
Well?

984
01:07:29,948 --> 01:07:32,416
It's a most severe attack.

985
01:07:32,817 --> 01:07:35,149
The hemorrhaging
may last for days.

986
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:38,422
I cabled the specialists
in Petersburg.

987
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,557
They won't reach here
until tomorrow night.

988
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:41,986
And the pain?

989
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:43,854
It comes in waves.

990
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:47,759
His fever's high.
There may be complications.

991
01:07:49,968 --> 01:07:51,936
All we can do
is watch and wait.

992
01:07:54,339 --> 01:07:56,136
He will recover, won't he?

993
01:07:57,108 --> 01:07:58,666
He's a strong boy.

994
01:08:03,615 --> 01:08:05,207
He really is, you know.

995
01:08:05,783 --> 01:08:07,375
The swelling...

996
01:08:07,886 --> 01:08:09,251
Did you see?

997
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:12,312
I hate this house.

998
01:08:12,757 --> 01:08:15,021
Of all the godforsaken places.

999
01:08:18,529 --> 01:08:20,224
Our guests.

1000
01:08:20,999 --> 01:08:22,762
What shall I say?

1001
01:08:23,701 --> 01:08:25,635
God. I'd forgotten.

1002
01:08:33,177 --> 01:08:35,168
I'm not sure I can manage.

1003
01:08:36,147 --> 01:08:39,947
As long as we are here,
no one will ever know about Alexis.

1004
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:35,200
I think it's best to wait.

1005
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:39,140
But if you wait, he may die.

1006
01:09:40,611 --> 01:09:42,704
This is the heir
to all the Russians.

1007
01:09:43,247 --> 01:09:46,114
Would you want his body
on your operating table?

1008
01:09:50,388 --> 01:09:52,913
You could not have chosen
a worse time.

1009
01:09:53,124 --> 01:09:55,251
My son, as we sit here,
is with the doctors.

1010
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:58,122
I didn't choose it, sire.
It was forced on me.

1011
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:00,820
I beg Your Majesty
to understand.

1012
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:03,257
Get on with it.

1013
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:06,231
There must, in my opinion,
be a change in policy.

1014
01:10:06,604 --> 01:10:09,164
Two hundred strikers
have been shot at Lena.

1015
01:10:09,374 --> 01:10:12,537
At this rate, we'll soon
have a million workers on strike.

1016
01:10:12,744 --> 01:10:14,439
We can't shoot them all.

1017
01:10:14,946 --> 01:10:17,574
The <i>Duma</i> must be reconvened.

1018
01:10:17,782 --> 01:10:20,478
Just leave your papers.
I'll read them when I can.

1019
01:10:20,685 --> 01:10:22,380
I need some answers now.

1020
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:23,781
I haven't any now.

1021
01:10:23,988 --> 01:10:25,182
Your Majesty, I must insist!

1022
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,755
Stay here, go back to Petersburg.

1023
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:28,516
I don't care what you do!

1024
01:10:29,527 --> 01:10:31,825
They want their <i>Duma...</i>

1025
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:34,087
...give it back to them!

1026
01:10:34,298 --> 01:10:36,289
I hope to God they rot in it!

1027
01:10:36,501 --> 01:10:37,365
As for...

1028
01:10:51,249 --> 01:10:53,046
They think it best to wait.

1029
01:10:54,252 --> 01:10:55,378
That's all?

1030
01:10:57,288 --> 01:10:58,414
What for?

1031
01:10:59,357 --> 01:11:00,517
What are they waiting for?

1032
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:02,791
Developments.

1033
01:11:04,128 --> 01:11:04,992
I see.

1034
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,827
And how long will the wait be?

1035
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:45,033
I want our friend.

1036
01:11:47,672 --> 01:11:49,469
The prime minister's been here.

1037
01:11:51,309 --> 01:11:53,072
He says they've shot more strikers.

1038
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:56,110
I can't even remember
how many this time.

1039
01:11:57,215 --> 01:11:59,445
We decided something important.

1040
01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:02,212
Oh, yes.

1041
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:04,011
The <i>Duma.</i>

1042
01:12:05,456 --> 01:12:07,720
I want this message sent now.

1043
01:12:08,059 --> 01:12:09,890
I want Father Gregory.

1044
01:12:10,128 --> 01:12:12,358
I was too young
when Father died.

1045
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:15,659
You were 26.

1046
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:23,400
I want our friend.

1047
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:28,809
If he's at home and starts tonight,
the trip will take a week.

1048
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:30,446
It's senseless.

1049
01:12:30,715 --> 01:12:32,012
Send it.

1050
01:12:33,084 --> 01:12:34,415
A funny thing.

1051
01:12:35,186 --> 01:12:36,676
My son is dying...

1052
01:12:37,922 --> 01:12:39,913
...and I can't cry.

1053
01:12:41,993 --> 01:12:43,824
When your father died...

1054
01:12:44,495 --> 01:12:46,554
...you wept for days.

1055
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,531
You never knew.

1056
01:12:51,802 --> 01:12:53,463
I never said...

1057
01:12:54,138 --> 01:12:56,800
...how I felt listening
to you sobbing...

1058
01:12:58,242 --> 01:13:00,904
...telling everyone
how afraid you were.

1059
01:13:02,113 --> 01:13:04,547
Most men are men at 21.

1060
01:13:06,651 --> 01:13:08,983
You made me so ashamed.

1061
01:13:10,388 --> 01:13:11,946
All right.

1062
01:13:23,834 --> 01:13:25,825
In the name of the Father...

1063
01:13:26,337 --> 01:13:27,827
...and of the Son...

1064
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:30,698
...and of the Holy Ghost...

1065
01:13:31,142 --> 01:13:32,234
...amen.

1066
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:41,750
"The Tsarevitch has been taken ill.

1067
01:13:41,953 --> 01:13:46,117
The heir's condition
is considered to be grave.

1068
01:13:46,324 --> 01:13:49,350
His response to treatment
so far..."

1069
01:13:50,528 --> 01:13:53,497
This one for midday
to announce...

1070
01:13:53,698 --> 01:13:54,892
...a severe relapse.

1071
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,726
And one...

1072
01:13:56,968 --> 01:13:58,959
...for tomorrow night.

1073
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,531
The final bulletin.

1074
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,332
I see.

1075
01:14:05,076 --> 01:14:06,407
As to the funeral plans...

1076
01:14:06,811 --> 01:14:08,142
For God's sake, Vladimir!

1077
01:14:09,247 --> 01:14:10,874
But you need to know.

1078
01:14:13,417 --> 01:14:15,612
The funeral train...

1079
01:14:16,053 --> 01:14:18,385
...will consist of 11...

1080
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:19,553
...cars.

1081
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:23,090
You should try to sleep.

1082
01:14:23,294 --> 01:14:24,124
No.

1083
01:14:25,296 --> 01:14:27,059
Some tea, at least.

1084
01:14:29,567 --> 01:14:30,591
It's come!

1085
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:31,995
He's answered.

1086
01:14:32,403 --> 01:14:33,233
Listen.

1087
01:14:34,071 --> 01:14:37,040
"God has seen your tears
and heard your prayers.

1088
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:38,299
Do not grieve.

1089
01:14:38,509 --> 01:14:40,272
The little one will not die.

1090
01:14:41,078 --> 01:14:42,409
Do not let the doctors
bother him.

1091
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:44,072
Be at peace.

1092
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:47,877
I am leaving immediately
and will be at your side soon."

1093
01:14:49,086 --> 01:14:50,576
He's not to be disturbed.

1094
01:14:50,788 --> 01:14:51,755
I want your promise.

1095
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:52,786
But, Your Majesty...

1096
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:54,582
No more doctors.

1097
01:14:54,992 --> 01:14:56,983
I can bar the door if need be.

1098
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:01,692
I can sleep now.

1099
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:11,404
All is well, my darling.

1100
01:15:21,686 --> 01:15:24,177
Will it make any difference
if Alexis is left alone?

1101
01:15:25,956 --> 01:15:27,480
No, I suppose not.

1102
01:15:51,682 --> 01:15:53,650
Alexei likes me best in rubies.

1103
01:15:53,851 --> 01:15:55,842
Come. We'll see him now.

1104
01:16:11,035 --> 01:16:12,468
Good morning, my darling.

1105
01:16:17,108 --> 01:16:18,700
Good morning, Mother.

1106
01:16:47,071 --> 01:16:49,301
Good day, and the Lord be with you.

1107
01:16:54,145 --> 01:16:56,113
And the Lord be with you!

1108
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,787
It's all right, baby.
We're here. It's all right.

1109
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:15,424
- Blood!
- Why do you have such nasty dreams?

1110
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:18,060
I heard a gun.
There was blood everywhere.

1111
01:18:20,231 --> 01:18:22,927
You were dreaming about
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

1112
01:18:23,501 --> 01:18:26,334
It was nothing.
I had a dream.

1113
01:18:27,638 --> 01:18:31,005
If you had a dream,
let's talk about it.

1114
01:18:35,513 --> 01:18:37,743
Are you all right now, Alexei?

1115
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:43,281
Franz Ferdinand's assassination
is bad for Austria and the Serbs...

1116
01:18:43,654 --> 01:18:46,316
...and for the assassin
and his family.

1117
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,058
But politics is like that
in the Balkans.

1118
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,352
The English vote
and the Serbs assassinate.

1119
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,030
You see, Serbia wants its freedom.

1120
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:57,757
Austria won't give it to them
and so this happens.

1121
01:18:58,035 --> 01:18:59,559
It has happened here.

1122
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:02,204
- They threw a bomb...
- Nicky, it's so late.

1123
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:04,440
They're not children anymore.

1124
01:19:04,642 --> 01:19:06,940
They must accept these things.

1125
01:19:07,778 --> 01:19:11,305
Grandfather was killed by a bomb.
So was Uncle Sergei.

1126
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:14,113
But Serbia is a long way off.

1127
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:18,418
And we don't need
to have bad dreams about Archdukes.

1128
01:19:18,822 --> 01:19:20,881
The diplomats will send
some angry notes.

1129
01:19:21,091 --> 01:19:25,619
A few generals will go on exercises
and everyone will be sensible again.

1130
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:30,523
All over Europe, kings and queens
are sleeping safely in their beds.

1131
01:19:30,734 --> 01:19:32,759
And that's what we're going to do.

1132
01:19:48,252 --> 01:19:49,981
Your Majesty must not.

1133
01:19:50,187 --> 01:19:52,519
This is only a partial mobilization.

1134
01:19:52,723 --> 01:19:55,214
It is against Austria,
not Germany, nor anyone else.

1135
01:19:55,993 --> 01:19:58,860
If Russia mobilizes,
there will be a war.

1136
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:00,724
The Austrians are shelling Belgrade.

1137
01:20:00,931 --> 01:20:02,592
We must be ready to defend ourselves.

1138
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:06,030
I'm ordering prayers for peace
to be said in all the churches.

1139
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:09,103
But now I must see my ministers
for armaments and recruitment.

1140
01:20:09,306 --> 01:20:11,069
It is in our hands, not God's.

1141
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,402
He gave us minds to reason.

1142
01:20:13,777 --> 01:20:16,678
We can talk sanity to lunatics.
We can calm mad dogs.

1143
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:19,405
God help us if we
have to start praying!

1144
01:20:19,617 --> 01:20:21,642
We can pray when we bury the dead!

1145
01:20:37,868 --> 01:20:40,632
Here is some wonderful news.
A telegram from the Kaiser.

1146
01:20:40,838 --> 01:20:42,169
Just what we wanted.

1147
01:20:42,373 --> 01:20:44,933
Offering to mediate
between us and Austria.

1148
01:20:45,142 --> 01:20:47,133
I knew I could count on Willy.

1149
01:20:48,078 --> 01:20:49,067
You see?

1150
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:53,148
He's signed it, "Your sincere and
devoted friend and cousin, Willy."

1151
01:20:54,118 --> 01:20:56,643
With due respect
to your cousin, sire...

1152
01:20:56,854 --> 01:20:58,879
...the Kaiser is a deceitful...

1153
01:20:59,423 --> 01:21:00,754
...megalomaniac.

1154
01:21:00,958 --> 01:21:02,721
If he is offering to help...

1155
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:04,894
...then it is time to pray.

1156
01:21:05,195 --> 01:21:06,457
They won't last a week.

1157
01:21:06,664 --> 01:21:09,292
We'll bury the German army and
that pansy of a Kaiser...

1158
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,127
...and be home for Christmas.

1159
01:21:13,837 --> 01:21:15,134
Colonel Volkov.

1160
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:18,975
Inform the staff that the situation
has improved greatly.

1161
01:21:19,176 --> 01:21:20,575
I'll brief them fully
in half an hour.

1162
01:21:20,778 --> 01:21:23,975
But shall we continue to prepare
for the general mobilization?

1163
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:25,614
In case?

1164
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,014
I'll brief you fully
in half an hour.

1165
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:32,120
We can't run a modern war, sir.

1166
01:21:32,456 --> 01:21:34,924
We're not fighting
Napoleon this time.

1167
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:38,253
Germany has ten miles
of railway to every one of ours.

1168
01:21:38,462 --> 01:21:40,828
They have 100 factories
to every one of ours.

1169
01:21:41,031 --> 01:21:42,726
All we have is men.

1170
01:21:42,933 --> 01:21:44,867
They'll be slaughtered like flies.

1171
01:21:45,335 --> 01:21:48,304
We have 11/2 million
men in uniform.

1172
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:52,004
Next week we'll have
41/2 million men in uniform.

1173
01:21:52,276 --> 01:21:55,973
At a casualty rate of 20%
wounded and 10% killed...

1174
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:58,307
...we can maintain an army
of five million men.

1175
01:21:58,515 --> 01:22:00,278
The Kaiser can't beat that.

1176
01:22:00,584 --> 01:22:02,745
Austria wants to humiliate us.

1177
01:22:02,953 --> 01:22:05,012
We must show her we'll be firm.

1178
01:22:05,322 --> 01:22:08,450
We need the mobilization or your
government will be outmaneuvered.

1179
01:22:09,126 --> 01:22:12,459
But if we mobilize,
the Kaiser will have to.

1180
01:22:12,663 --> 01:22:14,654
And France, and England.

1181
01:22:14,865 --> 01:22:16,389
Nobody will be able to stop.

1182
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:23,065
Send a telegram to the Kaiser
with a message from me.

1183
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:26,606
Say that though we've both mobilized,
it doesn't mean we'll fight.

1184
01:22:26,877 --> 01:22:28,344
And nothing will break
our old friendship.

1185
01:22:28,545 --> 01:22:29,842
Sign it "Nicky."

1186
01:22:35,953 --> 01:22:37,818
Order the general mobilization.

1187
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:41,651
Madness.

1188
01:22:47,798 --> 01:22:50,926
This one can't get to the colors
soon enough, can you?

1189
01:22:57,508 --> 01:22:58,998
I'm old, sir.

1190
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:02,238
I've seen so many wars.

1191
01:23:03,113 --> 01:23:06,173
They all seemed so
important at the time.

1192
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:07,882
Now...

1193
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,347
...I don't even remember
what they were called.

1194
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:13,483
Millions...

1195
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:15,424
...of dead men.

1196
01:23:17,461 --> 01:23:19,122
I don't know why.

1197
01:23:19,596 --> 01:23:20,893
Nobody knows.

1198
01:23:26,503 --> 01:23:29,233
You could so easily
stop this war, sir.

1199
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,035
All you have to do
is to get up...

1200
01:23:32,242 --> 01:23:33,436
...now...

1201
01:23:33,744 --> 01:23:34,870
...quietly...

1202
01:23:35,078 --> 01:23:36,943
...go home to your family.

1203
01:23:38,816 --> 01:23:41,979
You'd be the greatest
of all the Tsars.

1204
01:23:51,295 --> 01:23:54,128
Your Majesty's foreign minister,
Mr. Sazanov...

1205
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:56,993
...has received a note
from the German Ambassador.

1206
01:24:00,437 --> 01:24:01,461
Your Majesty...

1207
01:24:01,672 --> 01:24:03,833
...at ten minutes past seven
this evening...

1208
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:05,906
...Germany declared war on Russia.

1209
01:24:25,963 --> 01:24:27,089
Gentlemen...

1210
01:24:28,665 --> 01:24:30,860
...Germany has declared war on Russia.

1211
01:24:33,136 --> 01:24:34,398
God save Russia!

1212
01:24:35,873 --> 01:24:37,966
God save the Tsar.

1213
01:24:38,275 --> 01:24:40,505
God save the Tsar!

1214
01:25:06,236 --> 01:25:08,136
None of you will be here...

1215
01:25:08,338 --> 01:25:10,101
...when this war ends.

1216
01:25:10,307 --> 01:25:13,504
Everything we fought for
will be lost.

1217
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:17,009
Everything we loved
will be broken.

1218
01:25:17,481 --> 01:25:21,417
The victors will be as cursed
as the defeated.

1219
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:24,212
The world will grow old.

1220
01:25:24,421 --> 01:25:27,288
And men will wander about,
lost in the ruins...

1221
01:25:27,491 --> 01:25:28,958
...and go mad.

1222
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:30,656
Tradition.

1223
01:25:31,094 --> 01:25:32,391
Virtue.

1224
01:25:32,829 --> 01:25:34,160
Restraint.

1225
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:35,759
They all go!

1226
01:25:35,933 --> 01:25:39,369
I'm not mourning for myself,
but for the people who come after me.

1227
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:42,060
They will live without hope.

1228
01:25:43,006 --> 01:25:44,530
And all they will have...

1229
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:46,208
...will be guilt...

1230
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,741
...revenge...

1231
01:25:48,111 --> 01:25:49,408
...and terror.

1232
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,875
And the world will
be full of fanatics...

1233
01:25:54,151 --> 01:25:57,052
...and trivial fools.

1234
01:25:59,523 --> 01:26:02,048
Set all differences aside!

1235
01:26:02,426 --> 01:26:04,519
We are Russians first of all!

1236
01:26:04,728 --> 01:26:07,094
And until the day of victory dawns...

1237
01:26:07,297 --> 01:26:09,060
...we stand united...

1238
01:26:09,266 --> 01:26:11,393
...in the defense of Holy Russia!

1239
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:18,664
God save the Tsar!

1240
01:32:46,529 --> 01:32:49,554
- There's no transport. Can they walk?
- Yes, sir.

1241
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:52,862
They're needed at the front tonight.
See to it.

1242
01:32:55,572 --> 01:32:57,039
Right face!

1243
01:32:58,341 --> 01:33:00,104
Forward march!

1244
01:34:08,545 --> 01:34:10,274
Bitch! German bitch!

1245
01:34:10,647 --> 01:34:11,739
Shut up!

1246
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:26,255
Have you seen them?
What happened?

1247
01:34:26,463 --> 01:34:27,930
Would you like some tea?

1248
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:32,049
I've always hated this time of year.
It gets dark so early.

1249
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:34,932
Oh, Niki!
You gave in again.

1250
01:34:35,138 --> 01:34:36,435
You look so tired.

1251
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,368
Did you even see the ministers?

1252
01:34:38,575 --> 01:34:40,270
You want the minutes
of the meeting?

1253
01:34:40,477 --> 01:34:41,876
Just the gist of it.

1254
01:34:42,078 --> 01:34:44,876
I told them I proposed replacing
Nikolasha with myself...

1255
01:34:45,081 --> 01:34:47,379
...and was leaving for headquarters
to take command.

1256
01:34:47,584 --> 01:34:49,074
Go on. They said...?

1257
01:34:49,285 --> 01:34:51,810
Nothing much.
They said they'd all resign.

1258
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:54,452
They said the government would fall,
that it was madness.

1259
01:34:54,657 --> 01:34:55,487
And you took it?

1260
01:34:55,859 --> 01:34:57,349
- You gave in?
- They're my advisors.

1261
01:34:57,727 --> 01:34:58,591
You're their Tsar.

1262
01:34:58,962 --> 01:35:02,398
But what if they're right?
They might be. How can I be sure?

1263
01:35:02,599 --> 01:35:03,759
You must go.

1264
01:35:04,133 --> 01:35:07,432
Nikolasha is a bad man.
Father Gregory has said so.

1265
01:35:08,071 --> 01:35:09,971
I'm sick to death of Father Gregory.

1266
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,300
All my life...

1267
01:35:13,243 --> 01:35:15,404
...my whole life, I've
done what you want.

1268
01:35:15,612 --> 01:35:16,636
I gave Mother up.

1269
01:35:16,846 --> 01:35:19,212
You hated her, so we don't
see her anymore.

1270
01:35:19,415 --> 01:35:21,042
I gave my friends up.

1271
01:35:21,384 --> 01:35:23,249
Do you know I haven't a single friend?

1272
01:35:23,987 --> 01:35:25,545
I've got my family.

1273
01:35:26,055 --> 01:35:27,989
Four girls, one sick boy...

1274
01:35:29,392 --> 01:35:30,518
...and you.

1275
01:35:31,728 --> 01:35:32,558
I ask...

1276
01:35:32,896 --> 01:35:36,798
...before I eat or sleep
or change my clothes:

1277
01:35:37,066 --> 01:35:38,499
"Is this what Sunny wants?"

1278
01:35:39,235 --> 01:35:40,463
And it never is.

1279
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,137
There's always more!

1280
01:35:42,705 --> 01:35:44,400
Sweet Jesus! How much
do you want of me?

1281
01:35:45,642 --> 01:35:46,506
I want this.

1282
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:47,869
Don't you know I want to go?

1283
01:35:48,511 --> 01:35:50,672
For months there's
been no ammunition.

1284
01:35:51,381 --> 01:35:53,941
In Galicia, they ration bullets.
Three a day.

1285
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:57,313
My soldiers get three shots a day!
What can I do?

1286
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,181
I can't make shells.

1287
01:35:59,389 --> 01:36:00,515
I fire ministers...

1288
01:36:00,723 --> 01:36:03,089
...I hire ministers,
and nothing happens.

1289
01:36:03,293 --> 01:36:05,693
I'm no use here.
I belong at Stavka with my men!

1290
01:36:05,895 --> 01:36:08,762
Don't tell me.
Tell your ministers.

1291
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:12,727
You know people want me
to divorce you?

1292
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:16,061
Father Gregory warned me of that.

1293
01:36:17,006 --> 01:36:19,531
If I thought it would help,
I would go away.

1294
01:36:20,109 --> 01:36:21,337
But it would be disastrous.

1295
01:36:22,946 --> 01:36:25,244
Has Father Gregory told you that too?

1296
01:36:26,516 --> 01:36:29,542
I don't need anyone to tell me about us.

1297
01:36:33,323 --> 01:36:35,848
This is the beginning
of the glory of your reign.

1298
01:36:36,059 --> 01:36:37,686
Our friend told me so.

1299
01:36:37,994 --> 01:36:40,428
It will be the greatest page
in Russian history...

1300
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:43,121
...the story of these weeks and days.

1301
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:44,561
And when you go...

1302
01:36:44,767 --> 01:36:47,600
...don't worry over what
you've left behind. I'm here.

1303
01:36:48,237 --> 01:36:49,602
Lean on me.

1304
01:36:49,839 --> 01:36:50,999
Use me.

1305
01:36:52,308 --> 01:36:54,799
I'm not wise or strong...

1306
01:36:55,111 --> 01:36:57,306
...but God will show me what to do.

1307
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:00,906
With our armies in retreat,
you must not take command.

1308
01:37:01,117 --> 01:37:03,881
You could not have chosen
a more unfortunate time.

1309
01:37:04,087 --> 01:37:05,213
Faith in Your Majesty...

1310
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:08,083
...is the one thing that keeps
the whole country together.

1311
01:37:10,493 --> 01:37:11,892
Have I heard it all?

1312
01:37:12,095 --> 01:37:15,758
One thing. The headquarters
at Stavka is 500 miles from here.

1313
01:37:16,165 --> 01:37:17,291
Go on.

1314
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,730
While you're away,
who will run the government?

1315
01:37:20,136 --> 01:37:22,832
When the Tsar is with the Army,
the Tsaritza takes his place.

1316
01:37:23,806 --> 01:37:24,670
Sire!

1317
01:37:25,308 --> 01:37:28,709
With all respects, the Tsaritza's
lack of experience...

1318
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:32,642
...and limited understanding of the
Russian people, gracious though she...

1319
01:37:32,849 --> 01:37:34,680
I shall continue to make
the decisions...

1320
01:37:34,884 --> 01:37:37,079
...but you'll have to make
your reports to her.

1321
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:43,122
Thank you for your advice, gentlemen.

1322
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,825
I have thought about this.

1323
01:37:46,896 --> 01:37:49,194
And I know that God is with me.

1324
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:52,563
I leave for Stavka in the morning.

1325
01:37:57,607 --> 01:37:59,734
<i>My very own darling...</i>

1326
01:38:00,076 --> 01:38:02,772
<i>...remember last night</i>
<i>when we were together.</i>

1327
01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:05,443
<i>I yearn for your caresses.</i>

1328
01:38:05,648 --> 01:38:07,775
<i>I can never have enough of them.</i>

1329
01:38:08,418 --> 01:38:10,079
<i>I kiss you, caress you...</i>

1330
01:38:10,286 --> 01:38:12,686
<i>...love you, long for you...</i>

1331
01:38:12,889 --> 01:38:14,686
<i>...can't sleep without you.</i>

1332
01:38:14,891 --> 01:38:16,222
<i>Bless you...</i>

1333
01:38:16,693 --> 01:38:17,625
<i>...Sunny.</i>

1334
01:38:35,078 --> 01:38:36,636
Get up. We're moving out.

1335
01:38:37,847 --> 01:38:39,474
I said get up!

1336
01:39:16,552 --> 01:39:17,780
Your Majesty.

1337
01:39:29,999 --> 01:39:31,933
You can't be glad to see me.

1338
01:39:33,069 --> 01:39:34,934
You understand my reasons?

1339
01:39:36,672 --> 01:39:38,037
You think I'm wrong.

1340
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:40,270
The Tsar comes second after God.

1341
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:42,034
I would die for him.

1342
01:39:42,245 --> 01:39:43,439
I'm sorry, Nikolasha.

1343
01:39:43,646 --> 01:39:46,547
Don't be.
It's a great relief.

1344
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:49,675
Can't get away
from here soon enough.

1345
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:53,351
I've appointed General Alexeiev
Chief of Staff.

1346
01:39:53,556 --> 01:39:55,717
Good man, first class.

1347
01:39:55,925 --> 01:39:57,517
Listen to him.
Let him run things.

1348
01:39:57,727 --> 01:39:58,955
I intend to.

1349
01:39:59,695 --> 01:40:01,629
Can't do worse than I did.

1350
01:40:05,401 --> 01:40:06,459
You know...

1351
01:40:08,638 --> 01:40:11,732
...I've got a million corpses
on my hands.

1352
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:17,471
I weep too easily these days.
Getting old.

1353
01:40:18,047 --> 01:40:20,709
It's bitter, Nicky. Bitter.

1354
01:40:23,085 --> 01:40:24,985
I don't envy you.

1355
01:40:26,656 --> 01:40:28,089
What do you think I should do?

1356
01:40:28,291 --> 01:40:31,260
Retreat. Preserve the Army.
That's the only thing.

1357
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:32,654
And what else?

1358
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:34,659
Wear socks to bed.

1359
01:40:34,864 --> 01:40:36,229
Floors freeze in the winter.

1360
01:40:36,432 --> 01:40:38,525
I'll ask Sunny to knit me some.

1361
01:40:38,734 --> 01:40:40,599
She sends her love.

1362
01:40:40,803 --> 01:40:42,634
The devil she does!

1363
01:40:43,206 --> 01:40:46,573
I could have won this war if
I were only fighting on one front.

1364
01:40:46,776 --> 01:40:48,835
But I had two enemies at my back:

1365
01:40:49,045 --> 01:40:51,309
Your Sunny and her monk!

1366
01:40:51,814 --> 01:40:53,145
Not long ago he wrote to me...

1367
01:40:53,349 --> 01:40:55,613
...could he come
and bless the troops?

1368
01:40:55,818 --> 01:40:57,945
I told him if he came, I'd hang him.

1369
01:40:58,154 --> 01:40:59,746
Should have let him come.

1370
01:40:59,956 --> 01:41:01,981
Hung the bastard when he got here.

1371
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:18,901
God help you, Nicky.

1372
01:41:24,981 --> 01:41:26,881
God save the Tsar!

1373
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:29,878
God save the Tsar!

1374
01:41:32,822 --> 01:41:35,188
So, you'd like to be an opera singer?

1375
01:41:35,391 --> 01:41:37,518
Yes, you have the chest for it.

1376
01:41:42,198 --> 01:41:44,496
Have you ever sung in public before?

1377
01:41:47,637 --> 01:41:49,264
Go to the Imperial Theater...

1378
01:41:49,472 --> 01:41:50,439
...give them this.

1379
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,971
It's an introduction.

1380
01:41:52,174 --> 01:41:54,768
I have them printed up
now to save time.

1381
01:41:56,746 --> 01:41:58,077
Father Gregory.

1382
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:04,845
There's a gentleman arrived,
says he's the Minister of something.

1383
01:42:05,087 --> 01:42:06,645
Foreign Minister.

1384
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:08,855
He's early.

1385
01:42:09,725 --> 01:42:10,851
Send him in.

1386
01:42:11,093 --> 01:42:12,583
He might enjoy this.

1387
01:42:14,997 --> 01:42:17,557
Now let's hear you sing a little.

1388
01:42:18,567 --> 01:42:19,829
Don't worry.

1389
01:42:20,202 --> 01:42:21,567
I'm no judge.

1390
01:42:22,939 --> 01:42:25,066
Father Gregory says come in.

1391
01:42:29,178 --> 01:42:32,944
Has the Empress now made him
responsible for the arts?

1392
01:42:36,686 --> 01:42:38,381
My dear man!

1393
01:42:38,754 --> 01:42:40,722
Isn't she delightful?

1394
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:47,825
Absolutely charming.

1395
01:42:48,497 --> 01:42:50,795
I had no idea you had
asked me here for a recital.

1396
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,433
She wants to sing.

1397
01:42:52,702 --> 01:42:54,567
I like to help people.

1398
01:42:55,671 --> 01:42:56,729
You don't mind?

1399
01:42:56,939 --> 01:43:00,272
You've placed 3 men in my Ministry
who can neither read nor write.

1400
01:43:00,476 --> 01:43:02,376
Why should I mind?

1401
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:05,644
I don't hate anyone...

1402
01:43:05,948 --> 01:43:08,246
...and yet so many enemies.

1403
01:43:08,784 --> 01:43:09,978
I'm not rich.

1404
01:43:10,186 --> 01:43:12,086
What I get, I give away.

1405
01:43:13,089 --> 01:43:16,183
I take no vengeance on the men
I've removed from office.

1406
01:43:16,392 --> 01:43:19,384
When you fall, I won't abuse you.

1407
01:43:19,662 --> 01:43:21,857
We are appointed and
dismissed by the Tsar.

1408
01:43:22,064 --> 01:43:23,588
You're his enemy!

1409
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,436
You and all the other ministers.
You're all against him.

1410
01:43:27,636 --> 01:43:31,595
Can it be your dream to
have us all removed from office?

1411
01:43:32,108 --> 01:43:32,938
Every one.

1412
01:43:35,044 --> 01:43:37,512
You are destroying Russia!

1413
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:39,146
Don't you know it?

1414
01:43:39,348 --> 01:43:40,280
What's your price?

1415
01:43:40,483 --> 01:43:42,280
Do you want to be
made a pope or...

1416
01:43:42,485 --> 01:43:45,045
Grishka! How are
the miracles going today?

1417
01:43:45,955 --> 01:43:47,013
My God!

1418
01:43:47,623 --> 01:43:49,853
They're elevating
Grishka to the Cabinet.

1419
01:43:50,059 --> 01:43:52,653
Grand Duke Dmitry.
Prince Yussoupov.

1420
01:43:52,862 --> 01:43:53,794
Pray excuse me.

1421
01:43:53,996 --> 01:43:56,464
He tells me
I'm destroying Russia.

1422
01:43:57,433 --> 01:43:58,866
What, single-handed?

1423
01:43:59,068 --> 01:44:02,504
If you're friends of his, take him away.
Get him out of Petersburg.

1424
01:44:03,172 --> 01:44:05,606
Take your girls, or your boys.

1425
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:07,206
Frolic in the provinces...

1426
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:08,843
...but get him out of here!

1427
01:44:09,045 --> 01:44:11,343
Your Excellency sounds hysterical.

1428
01:44:11,547 --> 01:44:13,242
Your Highness ought to be.

1429
01:44:13,449 --> 01:44:14,939
Whatever happens, I'll survive.

1430
01:44:15,151 --> 01:44:17,642
There's always room
for one more bureaucrat.

1431
01:44:17,853 --> 01:44:19,320
I'll survive...

1432
01:44:19,855 --> 01:44:21,584
...but will you princes?

1433
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:22,780
No.

1434
01:44:23,793 --> 01:44:25,920
We're going to be
torn to pieces.

1435
01:44:26,328 --> 01:44:28,057
You politicians think
you're in control...

1436
01:44:28,264 --> 01:44:30,289
...but you'll be swept away
like the rest of us.

1437
01:44:30,499 --> 01:44:32,023
Rome, Athens...

1438
01:44:32,234 --> 01:44:33,997
...Petersburg.
You can't stop it.

1439
01:44:34,637 --> 01:44:36,969
In the meantime,
I shall enjoy myself.

1440
01:44:38,607 --> 01:44:40,472
Come to my place on Thursday.

1441
01:44:41,343 --> 01:44:43,334
I'm having a special little party.

1442
01:44:44,213 --> 01:44:45,043
Look.

1443
01:44:46,882 --> 01:44:48,611
This beautiful scarf.

1444
01:44:50,419 --> 01:44:51,386
Have it.

1445
01:44:56,358 --> 01:44:58,189
I can't stop the revolution.

1446
01:44:58,794 --> 01:45:01,422
But until it comes,
let's have some fun.

1447
01:45:02,264 --> 01:45:03,663
Even if it's only
for a few more days.

1448
01:45:03,866 --> 01:45:04,890
For God's sake!

1449
01:45:06,202 --> 01:45:08,033
Look, if I brought you money...

1450
01:45:08,237 --> 01:45:10,728
...if it were enough,
would you leave Petersburg?

1451
01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:12,601
I can't leave.

1452
01:45:13,642 --> 01:45:16,805
I want to serve
<i>Batushka</i> and <i>Matushka.</i>

1453
01:45:17,012 --> 01:45:18,172
I want peace...

1454
01:45:18,447 --> 01:45:20,972
...and food for
peasants everywhere.

1455
01:45:21,450 --> 01:45:23,281
I want that girl you saw...

1456
01:45:23,486 --> 01:45:25,681
...and all the girls
I haven't seen.

1457
01:45:25,888 --> 01:45:27,378
I want to sleep...

1458
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,956
...but can't sleep
unless I'm drunk.

1459
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,218
I want to die and go to Heaven.

1460
01:45:32,428 --> 01:45:33,554
I want music.

1461
01:45:33,762 --> 01:45:37,163
I want God to love me
and I want to see you dance!

1462
01:45:52,681 --> 01:45:53,841
Hello, Mama.

1463
01:45:59,155 --> 01:46:01,988
This is my Commander in Chief,
General Alexeiev.

1464
01:46:06,762 --> 01:46:08,559
How are Sunny and the children?

1465
01:46:09,598 --> 01:46:12,294
This is the first Christmas
I've spent away from the family.

1466
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:13,729
You look well.

1467
01:46:14,603 --> 01:46:16,867
I came to congratulate you, Nicky.

1468
01:46:17,072 --> 01:46:18,130
What for?

1469
01:46:18,574 --> 01:46:21,839
For finding from all Russia's
countless cretins...

1470
01:46:22,044 --> 01:46:23,636
...idiots and incompetents...

1471
01:46:23,846 --> 01:46:27,441
...the men least qualified
to run your government.

1472
01:46:32,354 --> 01:46:35,118
- Would you like some tea?
- I've taken tea.

1473
01:46:38,794 --> 01:46:41,786
I've tried to understand you,
but I can't.

1474
01:46:42,398 --> 01:46:44,229
I sometimes fail to judge men well.

1475
01:46:44,433 --> 01:46:47,402
Sometimes? How can one man
make so many mistakes?

1476
01:46:47,903 --> 01:46:50,064
Why did you stop
our Austrian campaign?

1477
01:46:50,272 --> 01:46:51,364
Our casualties were terrible.

1478
01:46:51,574 --> 01:46:53,599
You knew they would be
before you started.

1479
01:46:53,809 --> 01:46:55,504
Theirs were larger.

1480
01:46:56,011 --> 01:46:58,104
Mother, what do you
know about strategy?

1481
01:46:58,314 --> 01:46:59,508
What do you?

1482
01:47:00,015 --> 01:47:01,573
What are you
doing here, anyway?

1483
01:47:01,784 --> 01:47:03,615
There isn't a battlefield
within 500 miles.

1484
01:47:03,819 --> 01:47:05,753
It's important that I'm here.

1485
01:47:05,955 --> 01:47:07,422
Your place is in Petersburg.

1486
01:47:07,623 --> 01:47:11,389
Don't you know about the riots
and scandals and starvation?

1487
01:47:12,261 --> 01:47:15,560
They hate your wife.
They think she's a German spy.

1488
01:47:15,764 --> 01:47:18,392
How can you let that
foolish woman ruin your country?

1489
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:19,761
Leave Sunny out of this.

1490
01:47:20,803 --> 01:47:23,067
Someone has to make you
see sense about her.

1491
01:47:23,272 --> 01:47:24,671
Can't you think of anyone else?

1492
01:47:24,873 --> 01:47:26,807
Can't you think of
the rest of your family?

1493
01:47:27,276 --> 01:47:28,971
Can't you think of Russia?

1494
01:47:29,845 --> 01:47:31,142
I wish your father were alive.

1495
01:47:31,347 --> 01:47:32,507
Don't throw him at me!

1496
01:47:32,715 --> 01:47:33,773
He knew how to be a Tsar.

1497
01:47:33,983 --> 01:47:36,679
He'd have burnt Vienna down,
stamped on the Germans...

1498
01:47:36,885 --> 01:47:38,375
...and shot the strikers.

1499
01:47:39,021 --> 01:47:41,046
Anything to give Russia peace.

1500
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:45,055
And he'd certainly have known
how to deal with Rasputin.

1501
01:47:45,261 --> 01:47:46,319
He is a man of God.

1502
01:47:47,062 --> 01:47:48,222
Do you believe that?

1503
01:47:48,430 --> 01:47:50,898
He works miracles.
He keeps my son alive.

1504
01:47:51,367 --> 01:47:53,062
Do you believe that, Nicky?

1505
01:47:53,702 --> 01:47:55,499
Sunny does. She needs him.

1506
01:47:55,738 --> 01:47:57,035
Hang him!

1507
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:58,900
I don't wish any man harm...

1508
01:47:59,108 --> 01:48:01,941
...but so many Russians
will die if you don't.

1509
01:48:02,211 --> 01:48:03,178
I can't.

1510
01:48:03,379 --> 01:48:05,244
At least send him to Siberia.

1511
01:48:05,447 --> 01:48:06,345
I can't!

1512
01:48:06,548 --> 01:48:08,812
He's going to destroy us.

1513
01:48:09,018 --> 01:48:13,648
Millions will suffer. And all because
you can't say no to your wife.

1514
01:48:14,523 --> 01:48:15,353
It's in God's hands.

1515
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:17,149
That's no answer!

1516
01:48:17,693 --> 01:48:18,887
I see what's happening!

1517
01:48:19,094 --> 01:48:20,026
Then act!

1518
01:48:20,296 --> 01:48:21,786
Come back home.

1519
01:48:21,997 --> 01:48:24,625
Hang this man,
send Alexandra to Livadia...

1520
01:48:24,833 --> 01:48:26,164
...and deal with the real problems.

1521
01:48:26,535 --> 01:48:27,365
I can't!

1522
01:48:28,437 --> 01:48:30,803
In Heavers name, Nicholas,
what can you do?

1523
01:48:31,307 --> 01:48:33,502
Just what I'm doing, Mama.

1524
01:48:34,143 --> 01:48:35,804
There's nothing else
that can be done.

1525
01:49:19,955 --> 01:49:22,515
I hope you are not
on a diet, Father Gregory.

1526
01:49:35,404 --> 01:49:37,463
To <i>Batushka</i> and <i>Matushka.</i>

1527
01:49:46,682 --> 01:49:47,979
I'll die soon, my friends.

1528
01:49:50,085 --> 01:49:51,712
I've made my will.

1529
01:49:52,988 --> 01:49:55,183
I won't live to see the New Year.

1530
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:56,858
And it makes me angry.

1531
01:49:58,494 --> 01:50:01,429
It's good to enjoy yourself
with your friends.

1532
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:04,859
I don't want to die.

1533
01:50:12,241 --> 01:50:13,367
Russia!

1534
01:50:19,915 --> 01:50:20,973
Father Gregory...

1535
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:22,808
...needs a woman...

1536
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:25,310
...to cheer him up!

1537
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:59,843
I've been poisoned.

1538
01:52:01,083 --> 01:52:02,948
You've tried to kill me.

1539
01:52:05,454 --> 01:52:06,921
You all have.

1540
01:52:14,029 --> 01:52:15,428
You silly fools.

1541
01:52:15,631 --> 01:52:17,622
I thought I could trust you.

1542
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:19,829
You silly little fools.

1543
01:52:20,068 --> 01:52:22,662
You can't even kill properly.

1544
01:52:23,505 --> 01:52:25,939
You're too small to destroy me.

1545
01:52:29,278 --> 01:52:30,142
Look.

1546
01:52:35,651 --> 01:52:37,084
Cyanide!

1547
01:52:42,891 --> 01:52:44,825
Now get up, Prince!
Get up!

1548
01:52:45,027 --> 01:52:45,925
Try!

1549
01:52:46,161 --> 01:52:48,152
Let's see you try to kill me.

1550
01:52:48,363 --> 01:52:49,796
Cyanide!

1551
01:52:51,033 --> 01:52:53,160
I begged <i>Batushka</i> not
to start this war.

1552
01:52:53,435 --> 01:52:54,663
I know who dies.

1553
01:52:54,870 --> 01:52:56,667
You don't die.
The people die.

1554
01:52:56,872 --> 01:52:58,635
The wise old men,
the generals, the ministers...

1555
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,398
...the ones who say,
"Do this, go there!"

1556
01:53:00,609 --> 01:53:04,045
No mud on their boots!
No bullets in their brains!

1557
01:53:05,414 --> 01:53:07,405
Where's your rifle, Prince?

1558
01:53:07,816 --> 01:53:09,977
Why aren't you at the front,
where the blood is?

1559
01:53:10,185 --> 01:53:11,743
I'm not a German!

1560
01:53:12,521 --> 01:53:14,250
I come from the Russian soil...

1561
01:53:14,456 --> 01:53:16,447
...and you fools
will never destroy me!

1562
01:53:17,759 --> 01:53:19,056
Thank God...

1563
01:53:19,294 --> 01:53:21,592
...Russia has sons like me...

1564
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:25,163
...and isn't at the mercy
of scums like you!

1565
01:53:46,021 --> 01:53:47,545
Let's have the other side.

1566
01:53:52,527 --> 01:53:54,427
We must get rid of his body.

1567
01:55:26,054 --> 01:55:28,545
God bless the Tsar.

1568
01:55:48,043 --> 01:55:49,340
Your Majesty...

1569
01:55:49,611 --> 01:55:52,045
...the Cabinet has been
waiting for over an hour.

1570
01:55:52,247 --> 01:55:53,305
I can't see them today.

1571
01:55:53,515 --> 01:55:55,949
But we need you
to sign the decrees.

1572
01:55:56,151 --> 01:55:57,311
Petersburg is starving!

1573
01:55:57,519 --> 01:55:58,747
I can't.

1574
01:55:59,254 --> 01:56:01,586
You're glad he's dead!
You wanted him to die.

1575
01:56:04,226 --> 01:56:07,821
Please tell the ministers
my mother cannot see them today.

1576
01:56:08,363 --> 01:56:10,923
They will be informed of
a convenient time to come again.

1577
01:56:15,103 --> 01:56:18,095
Have Grand Duke Dmitry
and Prince Yussoupov arrested.

1578
01:56:18,740 --> 01:56:23,040
Only the Tsar can order the arrest
of one of his own family.

1579
01:56:23,245 --> 01:56:25,679
It's his monarchical privilege.

1580
01:56:33,688 --> 01:56:34,780
Please try.

1581
01:56:35,690 --> 01:56:36,952
His will.

1582
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:42,293
"I feel that I shall leave life
before January the first.

1583
01:56:45,667 --> 01:56:49,103
If any of your relatives
have wrought my death...

1584
01:56:49,671 --> 01:56:51,696
...then no one of your family...

1585
01:56:52,240 --> 01:56:56,142
...none of your children
or relatives will remain alive.

1586
01:56:56,545 --> 01:56:58,740
They will be killed
by the Russian people.

1587
01:56:59,948 --> 01:57:01,609
Brother will kill brother...

1588
01:57:03,351 --> 01:57:06,218
...and there will be
no nobles left in the country."

1589
01:57:13,595 --> 01:57:15,722
The beast is dead!

1590
01:57:16,298 --> 01:57:18,357
His killers are heroes!

1591
01:57:19,467 --> 01:57:20,729
Russia is saved!

1592
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:23,569
Mr. President.

1593
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,034
Mr. President!

1594
01:57:27,175 --> 01:57:28,836
Mr. President!

1595
01:57:29,044 --> 01:57:31,171
I have the floor,
Mr. Kerensky.

1596
01:57:31,379 --> 01:57:35,213
One madman has been murdered
and you are celebrating.

1597
01:57:35,417 --> 01:57:37,851
There is no food, no fuel.

1598
01:57:38,653 --> 01:57:41,417
A third of our army
is still unarmed...

1599
01:57:41,623 --> 01:57:44,820
...and they are surrendering
in tens of thousands.

1600
01:57:45,026 --> 01:57:47,187
Nothing is changed.

1601
01:57:47,395 --> 01:57:50,762
The German Tsaritza is
still running the country.

1602
01:57:50,966 --> 01:57:53,298
The Tsar must stop hiding
with his soldiers...

1603
01:57:53,501 --> 01:57:55,492
...and come back to Petersburg!

1604
01:57:55,804 --> 01:57:57,533
Chaos is coming to Russia...

1605
01:57:57,739 --> 01:58:00,105
...and he should be
here to deal with it!

1606
01:59:14,182 --> 01:59:15,376
Your Majesty?

1607
01:59:17,819 --> 01:59:19,343
What is it, Alexeiev?

1608
01:59:19,554 --> 01:59:22,182
There is a general strike
in St. Petersburg.

1609
01:59:22,657 --> 01:59:24,522
The city is in chaos.

1610
01:59:24,793 --> 01:59:26,226
It can't be.

1611
01:59:27,062 --> 01:59:28,086
We're at war.

1612
01:59:28,296 --> 01:59:30,764
There are demonstrations
in the streets.

1613
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:34,259
The Army refuses to fire on them.

1614
01:59:38,707 --> 01:59:41,107
Telegraph this to the
Military Governor:

1615
01:59:42,410 --> 01:59:45,277
All riots are to be
stopped at once.

1616
01:59:46,214 --> 01:59:48,114
The <i>Duma</i> is to be dissolved.

1617
01:59:48,917 --> 01:59:51,408
I return immediately
to Petersburg.

1618
01:59:51,953 --> 01:59:53,887
And sign it Nicholas.

1619
01:59:54,689 --> 01:59:58,785
Sire, I hope there is someone
in Petersburg to take our orders.

1620
02:00:13,875 --> 02:00:16,173
Madame, his fever is still the same.

1621
02:00:17,712 --> 02:00:19,373
If only it would break.

1622
02:00:20,515 --> 02:00:23,075
Why did they have to
go and get measles now?

1623
02:00:27,055 --> 02:00:28,386
Lie down, darling.

1624
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:29,882
I heard it again.

1625
02:00:30,091 --> 02:00:31,991
It's nothing.
You must keep warm.

1626
02:00:35,330 --> 02:00:37,230
When you've finished,
get some rest.

1627
02:00:44,406 --> 02:00:45,964
Still no news from the Tsar.

1628
02:00:46,174 --> 02:00:48,039
They don't answer our telegrams.

1629
02:00:48,243 --> 02:00:49,801
We must reach him.

1630
02:00:50,011 --> 02:00:51,774
He must come back.

1631
02:00:52,747 --> 02:00:54,647
God knows what'll happen.

1632
02:00:55,216 --> 02:00:56,444
I heard some more firing.

1633
02:01:32,587 --> 02:01:35,351
We're cut off. Soldiers on
the track ahead, Your Majesty.

1634
02:01:35,557 --> 02:01:36,489
They've got artillery.

1635
02:01:36,691 --> 02:01:39,319
I must get through to Tsarkoe Selo.
My family's there.

1636
02:01:39,527 --> 02:01:40,391
We can't.

1637
02:01:40,595 --> 02:01:43,792
There's open track to Moscow
or to northern headquarters at Pskov.

1638
02:01:44,065 --> 02:01:45,089
I see.

1639
02:01:48,069 --> 02:01:49,161
Where should we go?

1640
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:51,235
They're rioting in Moscow.

1641
02:01:55,110 --> 02:01:57,305
Well, then. To Pskov.

1642
02:02:22,637 --> 02:02:24,605
Thank God you're here.
Prepare an order...

1643
02:02:24,806 --> 02:02:27,036
Your Majesty, I'm afraid
it's too late.

1644
02:02:27,709 --> 02:02:31,042
The <i>Duma</i> has appointed
a provisional government.

1645
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:34,239
And all your ministers
have been arrested.

1646
02:02:36,885 --> 02:02:38,750
Order your troops...

1647
02:02:39,554 --> 02:02:40,578
...to march...

1648
02:02:40,788 --> 02:02:43,154
At this moment, Your Majesty...

1649
02:02:43,358 --> 02:02:45,690
...if my troops knew
the Tsar was here...

1650
02:02:45,894 --> 02:02:47,691
...there's every chance
they would turn on you.

1651
02:02:47,896 --> 02:02:49,659
Whole garrisons are going over.

1652
02:02:51,533 --> 02:02:54,764
Sire, the <i>Duma</i> also insists...

1653
02:02:56,304 --> 02:02:57,498
...on your abdication.

1654
02:03:23,331 --> 02:03:26,027
Surely my generals
stand with me?

1655
02:03:26,234 --> 02:03:27,758
I have already...

1656
02:03:28,236 --> 02:03:30,602
...been in touch
with the Commanders.

1657
02:03:31,506 --> 02:03:33,030
General Kornilov:

1658
02:03:34,242 --> 02:03:37,370
"I cannot order
an attack on Petersburg."

1659
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,211
Admiral of the Baltic Fleet...

1660
02:03:41,482 --> 02:03:42,414
...Nepenin:

1661
02:03:43,918 --> 02:03:45,977
"It is with greatest difficulty...

1662
02:03:46,187 --> 02:03:48,621
...I keep my troops
and the fleet in check.

1663
02:03:49,023 --> 02:03:51,890
I urge the Tsar to abdicate."

1664
02:03:53,995 --> 02:03:55,087
General Ruzsky:

1665
02:03:56,064 --> 02:03:58,328
"I cannot answer for my troops.

1666
02:03:58,900 --> 02:04:00,561
I implore His Majesty...

1667
02:04:00,835 --> 02:04:01,859
...to abdicate."

1668
02:04:02,704 --> 02:04:04,535
His Imperial Highness,
General Nicolaievich...

1669
02:04:04,739 --> 02:04:06,468
What does Nikolasha say?

1670
02:04:07,242 --> 02:04:08,607
"On my knees...

1671
02:04:09,444 --> 02:04:11,503
...I beg you to abdicate...

1672
02:04:11,946 --> 02:04:13,846
...and save the dynasty."

1673
02:05:29,691 --> 02:05:31,682
Nicky, please come home.

1674
02:05:33,094 --> 02:05:34,721
Tell me, Dr. Federov.

1675
02:05:34,929 --> 02:05:35,987
If my son...

1676
02:05:36,197 --> 02:05:37,755
...as the future Tsar...

1677
02:05:37,965 --> 02:05:40,934
...would remain behind
to be educated in Russia...

1678
02:05:41,135 --> 02:05:43,433
...while I and my family
went abroad...

1679
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:48,265
...how long would he
be likely to live?

1680
02:05:48,843 --> 02:05:50,367
Deprived of your love and care...

1681
02:05:50,578 --> 02:05:53,877
...and what I call "customary
surroundings," it's hard to say.

1682
02:05:54,082 --> 02:05:56,550
It's a matter of
luck and chance, Your Majesty.

1683
02:05:56,751 --> 02:05:58,184
There are no real statistics.

1684
02:05:58,653 --> 02:06:01,918
One would hope that he could
live a normal span of life, but...

1685
02:06:02,123 --> 02:06:03,021
Well...

1686
02:06:03,958 --> 02:06:04,982
...twenty...

1687
02:06:05,259 --> 02:06:06,749
...would be a good age.

1688
02:06:19,273 --> 02:06:22,436
"Accordingly, in agreement
with the Imperial <i>Duma...</i>

1689
02:06:22,643 --> 02:06:25,476
...we have thought it right to
abdicate from the Russian throne...

1690
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,807
...and to lay down
the supreme power.

1691
02:06:28,015 --> 02:06:28,845
Therefore..."

1692
02:06:29,050 --> 02:06:30,608
It seems in order.

1693
02:06:30,918 --> 02:06:31,850
May I?

1694
02:06:33,488 --> 02:06:35,979
- "Therefore, in the name..."
- I won't tear it up.

1695
02:06:38,926 --> 02:06:40,553
Shall I sign it in your lap?

1696
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:52,297
I wish to add one thing more.

1697
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:54,999
I shall abdicate for myself...

1698
02:06:55,209 --> 02:06:56,870
...and also for my son.

1699
02:06:58,146 --> 02:06:59,943
But, Your Majesty...

1700
02:07:00,281 --> 02:07:01,748
...the <i>Duma</i> thought that...

1701
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:04,877
Everyone expected
that your son would...

1702
02:07:05,086 --> 02:07:06,678
May I know the reasons?

1703
02:07:07,321 --> 02:07:09,346
My reasons are personal.

1704
02:07:10,224 --> 02:07:13,091
In that case, I shall
add the appropriate clause.

1705
02:07:16,531 --> 02:07:18,965
It will be spring soon at Livadia.

1706
02:07:20,835 --> 02:07:22,097
Is that where you'll send us?

1707
02:07:23,905 --> 02:07:25,770
Yes, if you like.

1708
02:07:26,007 --> 02:07:28,373
We've had no time
to plan ahead.

1709
02:07:29,377 --> 02:07:32,175
I've often thought I'd
like to be a country gentleman.

1710
02:07:32,814 --> 02:07:35,112
I've always liked
to watch things grow.

1711
02:07:35,783 --> 02:07:37,045
It's lovely there.

1712
02:07:38,352 --> 02:07:39,876
The sun is warm.

1713
02:07:41,189 --> 02:07:43,350
And they say the soil
is very good.

1714
02:07:44,392 --> 02:07:47,122
Much of the happiness
I've known I've had there.

1715
02:07:47,495 --> 02:07:48,792
It's now in order.

1716
02:08:06,047 --> 02:08:07,036
March...

1717
02:08:09,116 --> 02:08:09,980
...the 15th...

1718
02:08:10,184 --> 02:08:12,379
...1917.

1719
02:08:15,623 --> 02:08:17,250
The Ides of March.

1720
02:08:37,812 --> 02:08:41,043
If only you had acted sooner, sir.

1721
02:08:42,650 --> 02:08:45,244
You think this
could have been avoided?

1722
02:09:05,206 --> 02:09:06,070
Who is there?

1723
02:09:06,674 --> 02:09:08,335
Nicholas Romanov.

1724
02:09:09,043 --> 02:09:10,067
Let him pass.

1725
02:11:14,669 --> 02:11:15,693
I'm sorry.

1726
02:11:17,104 --> 02:11:18,298
Please...

1727
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:19,870
...don't...

1728
02:11:21,075 --> 02:11:22,872
Please!

1729
02:11:28,115 --> 02:11:29,104
Please!

1730
02:11:29,717 --> 02:11:31,981
I didn't mean to.

1731
02:11:33,154 --> 02:11:34,212
Please!

1732
02:11:35,890 --> 02:11:37,517
I'm so ashamed.

1733
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:41,821
I didn't mean to do it.

1734
02:11:42,697 --> 02:11:44,324
Please don't!

1735
02:11:45,066 --> 02:11:47,466
Please don't!

1736
02:11:47,802 --> 02:11:49,326
Please!

1737
02:12:08,489 --> 02:12:10,787
Graduated at Kazan University...

1738
02:12:10,991 --> 02:12:12,686
...with a degree in law.

1739
02:12:14,061 --> 02:12:14,891
Brother...

1740
02:12:15,496 --> 02:12:18,795
...hanged for terrorism
in 1887...

1741
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:21,900
...by the present Tsar's father.

1742
02:12:23,370 --> 02:12:24,302
Married.

1743
02:12:25,706 --> 02:12:26,832
No children.

1744
02:12:27,708 --> 02:12:28,970
Doesn't smoke.

1745
02:12:30,911 --> 02:12:33,072
And won't let his comrades...

1746
02:12:33,581 --> 02:12:34,570
...smoke.

1747
02:12:37,318 --> 02:12:39,183
Grandson of a serf.

1748
02:12:40,621 --> 02:12:42,179
Well-traveled, I see.

1749
02:12:42,389 --> 02:12:44,914
The Tsar should have had
your secret police.

1750
02:12:45,159 --> 02:12:47,627
My party will make
a study of your methods.

1751
02:12:48,295 --> 02:12:50,661
They fail to mention
your sense of humor.

1752
02:12:50,865 --> 02:12:52,332
It gets even funnier.

1753
02:12:52,533 --> 02:12:55,866
I want to get to Petersburg.
You want to get to Paris.

1754
02:12:56,070 --> 02:12:57,731
It's outrageous.

1755
02:12:57,938 --> 02:13:00,168
We are here in Zurich,
and if I understand you...

1756
02:13:00,374 --> 02:13:03,741
...you want the German government,
which is at war with Russia...

1757
02:13:03,944 --> 02:13:06,344
...to take you across
Germany to Sweden...

1758
02:13:06,547 --> 02:13:08,538
...because you can get
to Russia from there.

1759
02:13:08,916 --> 02:13:10,645
I'm offering to stop the war.

1760
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:14,850
I didn't know you had
so much authority.

1761
02:13:15,756 --> 02:13:17,621
If we had a Bolshevik government...

1762
02:13:17,825 --> 02:13:19,952
...we'd immediately
make peace with Germany.

1763
02:13:20,161 --> 02:13:23,187
Then how many German divisions could
you transfer to the western front?

1764
02:13:23,664 --> 02:13:27,395
And now you are asking me
for classified information.

1765
02:13:27,701 --> 02:13:31,728
Do you know my government locked up
more Bolsheviks than anyone else?

1766
02:13:32,039 --> 02:13:33,802
How can you expect us...

1767
02:13:34,008 --> 02:13:35,873
...to help you make a revolution?

1768
02:13:36,076 --> 02:13:37,668
You have no sense of proportion.

1769
02:13:37,878 --> 02:13:40,438
All I'm interested in
is power in Russia.

1770
02:13:40,648 --> 02:13:43,208
It's lying on the streets
waiting to be picked up.

1771
02:13:43,651 --> 02:13:45,915
Kerensky won't last.
He's still fighting the war...

1772
02:13:46,120 --> 02:13:48,680
...and the people are
desperate for peace.

1773
02:13:48,923 --> 02:13:50,584
I shall offer them peace.

1774
02:13:51,325 --> 02:13:53,953
Then you'll see
the real revolution.

1775
02:13:54,295 --> 02:13:57,196
I see your jokes
are very subtle.

1776
02:13:57,398 --> 02:14:00,424
A Marxist wants to use the Kaiser.

1777
02:14:01,702 --> 02:14:04,227
And perhaps the Kaiser...

1778
02:14:04,438 --> 02:14:06,599
...can use a Marxist.

1779
02:14:22,656 --> 02:14:23,623
There.

1780
02:14:25,259 --> 02:14:27,352
In a few months,
these will be turnips.

1781
02:14:27,962 --> 02:14:29,293
They're carrots.

1782
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:31,395
And when they grow...

1783
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:33,760
...will we still be here to eat them?

1784
02:14:35,135 --> 02:14:36,693
Nicholas Romanov!

1785
02:15:08,736 --> 02:15:10,533
My name is Kerensky.

1786
02:15:11,739 --> 02:15:14,833
I always used to offer
sherry in this room.

1787
02:15:15,609 --> 02:15:16,974
There's none left.

1788
02:15:17,177 --> 02:15:19,475
I haven't much time.
We must talk.

1789
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:21,511
What's happening to the war?

1790
02:15:21,715 --> 02:15:23,910
We hear the soldiers talking.
One hears of...

1791
02:15:24,118 --> 02:15:25,745
...terrible defeats.

1792
02:15:25,953 --> 02:15:27,318
Will we fight on?

1793
02:15:27,521 --> 02:15:28,681
Certainly.

1794
02:15:28,889 --> 02:15:31,221
The future of my government
depends on it.

1795
02:15:31,425 --> 02:15:33,791
We stand pledged to victory.

1796
02:15:33,994 --> 02:15:37,760
What all of us have been through
has some meaning after all.

1797
02:15:39,333 --> 02:15:41,358
Will we be staying
here much longer?

1798
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:43,900
You will be leaving here
in a few days.

1799
02:15:45,406 --> 02:15:47,499
All we do is dream of England.

1800
02:15:47,975 --> 02:15:49,909
We've been very happy there.

1801
02:15:50,611 --> 02:15:52,806
- May I sit down?
- I'm sorry.

1802
02:15:55,182 --> 02:15:56,740
England won't accept you.

1803
02:15:59,386 --> 02:16:00,717
Won't accept?

1804
02:16:01,989 --> 02:16:03,354
King George is my cousin.

1805
02:16:03,557 --> 02:16:05,548
He doesn't seem to want you, either.

1806
02:16:05,926 --> 02:16:08,087
He has to think of his own position.

1807
02:16:08,395 --> 02:16:09,726
Of course.

1808
02:16:10,631 --> 02:16:13,293
I must not make difficulties for...

1809
02:16:13,901 --> 02:16:15,562
Nor will the French.

1810
02:16:15,903 --> 02:16:18,337
None of our allies want to risk it.

1811
02:16:18,973 --> 02:16:20,804
They are at war to save democracy...

1812
02:16:21,008 --> 02:16:22,202
...and you were a tyrant.

1813
02:16:22,676 --> 02:16:23,904
I'm a prisoner.

1814
02:16:24,912 --> 02:16:26,846
Damn them, I'm a father
with a family!

1815
02:16:27,047 --> 02:16:28,241
You will be safe.

1816
02:16:28,449 --> 02:16:30,041
I'll see to that.

1817
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:33,845
There's blood enough on everybody's
hands. I won't have yours on mine.

1818
02:16:34,355 --> 02:16:35,652
Just as soon as possible...

1819
02:16:35,856 --> 02:16:37,323
...you'll be leaving for Siberia...

1820
02:16:37,524 --> 02:16:38,889
...to a village near Tobolsk.

1821
02:16:39,093 --> 02:16:40,082
Siberia?

1822
02:16:40,494 --> 02:16:42,189
You will be staying there
for a week or so...

1823
02:16:42,396 --> 02:16:45,388
...until I can organize some way
for you to leave the country.

1824
02:16:45,599 --> 02:16:46,861
From there on...

1825
02:16:47,067 --> 02:16:48,932
...I wash my hands of you.

1826
02:16:51,638 --> 02:16:53,435
Why not send us out to Finland?

1827
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:55,198
It's just 30 miles away.

1828
02:16:55,409 --> 02:16:57,707
I'd never get you through
St. Petersburg alive.

1829
02:16:58,312 --> 02:17:01,372
Do you realize I'm all that stands
between you and the block?

1830
02:17:02,483 --> 02:17:03,381
No munitions.

1831
02:17:04,218 --> 02:17:05,685
No supplies.

1832
02:17:06,487 --> 02:17:08,955
I don't know where the Army stands.

1833
02:17:10,024 --> 02:17:11,719
Treasury is bankrupt.

1834
02:17:11,959 --> 02:17:13,756
The students riot.

1835
02:17:14,361 --> 02:17:16,261
Workers carry arms.

1836
02:17:16,463 --> 02:17:18,931
The Socialists want this.
The Menshiviks want that.

1837
02:17:19,133 --> 02:17:22,193
The radicals, the centrists,
the cadets.

1838
02:17:22,636 --> 02:17:24,035
The Bolsheviks.

1839
02:17:25,072 --> 02:17:27,666
I can't arrest them
even if I wanted to.

1840
02:17:27,975 --> 02:17:30,273
We have rights and laws now.

1841
02:17:30,811 --> 02:17:33,177
You had power and no laws.

1842
02:17:33,380 --> 02:17:35,405
I have laws and no power.

1843
02:17:36,917 --> 02:17:38,248
I wish I could help you.

1844
02:17:38,986 --> 02:17:40,817
You had your chances.

1845
02:17:41,655 --> 02:17:42,917
I wish I had mine.

1846
02:18:45,052 --> 02:18:46,485
Revolution!

1847
02:18:49,523 --> 02:18:51,787
Revolution, now!

1848
02:18:53,961 --> 02:18:55,019
Land!

1849
02:18:55,829 --> 02:18:56,818
Peace!

1850
02:18:58,465 --> 02:18:59,762
All power...

1851
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:01,761
...to the Soviets!

1852
02:19:08,308 --> 02:19:12,244
Not quite like your Parliament.
We haven't English manners yet.

1853
02:19:12,513 --> 02:19:16,040
My government is more concerned
with content than style.

1854
02:19:16,416 --> 02:19:19,317
One detects a sentiment for peace.
That worries us.

1855
02:19:19,686 --> 02:19:20,983
It's mostly the Bolsheviks.

1856
02:19:21,188 --> 02:19:23,019
Nobody pays any attention to them.

1857
02:19:23,223 --> 02:19:25,088
They only have 6 members
in the <i>Duma.</i>

1858
02:19:25,392 --> 02:19:28,361
In your position, I'd put
this Lenin quietly in jail.

1859
02:19:28,562 --> 02:19:29,494
On what pretext?

1860
02:19:29,696 --> 02:19:31,823
I've read his speeches.
Surely you have too.

1861
02:19:32,065 --> 02:19:35,262
I cannot put a man in jail
for what he thinks.

1862
02:19:35,469 --> 02:19:36,595
It's in your Bill of Rights.

1863
02:19:36,803 --> 02:19:38,794
He wants to overthrow
the government by force.

1864
02:19:39,006 --> 02:19:40,598
We Americans call that treason.

1865
02:19:40,807 --> 02:19:42,240
In Russia, it's always been...

1866
02:19:42,643 --> 02:19:45,806
...too easy to lock a man up
because he disagrees with you.

1867
02:19:46,113 --> 02:19:47,603
It's a bad habit.

1868
02:19:47,915 --> 02:19:48,939
If the people want Lenin...

1869
02:19:49,316 --> 02:19:51,546
...they can vote him into power
in December.

1870
02:19:51,752 --> 02:19:53,185
Until that time...

1871
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:56,311
Rodzianko has finished.
I must speak now.

1872
02:19:56,523 --> 02:19:59,424
I trust I've made my government's
position clear.

1873
02:19:59,626 --> 02:20:02,322
America wants Russia in the war.

1874
02:20:02,529 --> 02:20:04,019
The British government is equally...

1875
02:20:04,364 --> 02:20:06,025
...worried about the
peace demonstrations.

1876
02:20:06,233 --> 02:20:07,598
No more than France.

1877
02:20:07,801 --> 02:20:10,668
Russia's contribution is vital
to the Allied cause.

1878
02:20:10,871 --> 02:20:12,236
Let me be blunt, Mr. Kerensky.

1879
02:20:12,606 --> 02:20:16,167
We're offering you 300
million dollars if you fight.

1880
02:20:16,610 --> 02:20:17,907
No war, no loan.

1881
02:20:18,445 --> 02:20:20,640
You cannot buy Russia.

1882
02:20:21,548 --> 02:20:22,845
We will fight...

1883
02:20:23,050 --> 02:20:25,712
...because we've already
sacrificed too much.

1884
02:20:26,086 --> 02:20:28,577
We owe it to the dead!

1885
02:20:28,789 --> 02:20:31,257
They must count for something!

1886
02:20:31,625 --> 02:20:32,922
Victory!

1887
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,455
Nothing less than victory!

1888
02:20:53,013 --> 02:20:54,037
Look! Look!

1889
02:20:54,615 --> 02:20:56,378
I've found Tobolsk on the map.

1890
02:20:56,583 --> 02:20:58,016
It's further away than London.

1891
02:20:58,385 --> 02:20:59,943
Yes, <i>ma chère.</i>

1892
02:21:01,054 --> 02:21:03,852
Now remember, you are princesses.

1893
02:21:04,224 --> 02:21:06,715
If I hear of any misbehavior...

1894
02:21:07,427 --> 02:21:09,759
...I shall be very angry.

1895
02:21:10,297 --> 02:21:11,491
We'll be good.

1896
02:21:14,201 --> 02:21:16,499
You're all so big now.

1897
02:21:19,539 --> 02:21:21,439
Help Mama and Papa.

1898
02:21:22,142 --> 02:21:23,632
Yes, we will.

1899
02:21:28,949 --> 02:21:30,507
Goodbye, Alexis.

1900
02:21:35,656 --> 02:21:37,180
I'm glad we're going.

1901
02:21:37,624 --> 02:21:38,784
I hate this place.

1902
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:45,425
Let me come with you.

1903
02:21:47,801 --> 02:21:49,928
You're too old for Siberia.

1904
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:51,532
You'll be all right.

1905
02:21:51,738 --> 02:21:53,365
But who will look after you?

1906
02:21:53,573 --> 02:21:56,565
You've never been
anywhere without me.

1907
02:22:05,485 --> 02:22:07,043
Take care of yourself.

1908
02:22:11,358 --> 02:22:12,825
The train is ready.

1909
02:22:13,026 --> 02:22:14,550
This is Colonel Kobylinsky.

1910
02:22:14,761 --> 02:22:17,696
You will be under his command
until you leave the country.

1911
02:22:17,898 --> 02:22:20,389
His orders carry my authority
at all times.

1912
02:22:20,634 --> 02:22:22,898
Nicholas, I want my things.

1913
02:22:24,471 --> 02:22:26,496
I want my pictures and scrapbooks.
I want...

1914
02:22:26,707 --> 02:22:28,106
<i>Frau</i> Romanov.

1915
02:22:28,475 --> 02:22:30,136
You have kept your head.

1916
02:22:30,344 --> 02:22:31,868
You should be grateful.

1917
02:22:35,515 --> 02:22:37,506
Come along. It doesn't matter.

1918
02:22:37,984 --> 02:22:41,511
No, Vladimir. One goodbye
was enough, please.

1919
02:22:44,424 --> 02:22:45,652
Things.

1920
02:22:46,393 --> 02:22:48,156
Things one can do without.

1921
02:22:48,362 --> 02:22:50,523
They break, get lost.

1922
02:22:51,365 --> 02:22:52,992
One buys and sells them.

1923
02:22:54,167 --> 02:22:56,658
The main thing is we are together.

1924
02:23:55,796 --> 02:23:57,195
Power stations.

1925
02:23:57,697 --> 02:23:59,289
All railway stations.

1926
02:23:59,699 --> 02:24:00,961
State bank.

1927
02:24:01,701 --> 02:24:02,998
Central telephone exchange.

1928
02:24:16,483 --> 02:24:19,611
The Bolsheviks have taken over
the station...

1929
02:24:19,820 --> 02:24:21,219
...the telegraphs...

1930
02:24:21,655 --> 02:24:22,917
...the banks.

1931
02:24:24,357 --> 02:24:26,552
How strong are they?

1932
02:24:27,093 --> 02:24:29,288
If we had loyal troops...

1933
02:24:29,496 --> 02:24:31,691
...how many would it take
to dislodge them?

1934
02:24:31,898 --> 02:24:34,162
One regiment would be enough.

1935
02:24:35,669 --> 02:24:37,466
But I haven't got a regiment.

1936
02:24:38,004 --> 02:24:39,028
Not one I can trust.

1937
02:24:40,774 --> 02:24:44,210
Yes, but there's only
a handful of them, surely!

1938
02:24:44,678 --> 02:24:47,772
We could smash them
if we acted now!

1939
02:24:48,482 --> 02:24:51,246
We told the people
to go on with the war.

1940
02:24:51,451 --> 02:24:53,214
Lenin offered peace.

1941
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,681
That's where we went wrong.

1942
02:24:56,490 --> 02:24:57,821
Look at this.

1943
02:25:02,329 --> 02:25:03,921
The cruiser <i>Aurora.</i>

1944
02:25:05,065 --> 02:25:07,465
And every gun is trained on us.

1945
02:25:13,874 --> 02:25:15,535
The government has fallen.

1946
02:25:30,090 --> 02:25:32,558
We shall now begin to construct...

1947
02:25:32,759 --> 02:25:34,021
...the Socialist order.

1948
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:09,558
What's it say?

1949
02:26:10,330 --> 02:26:11,854
It's twenty-one below.

1950
02:26:12,499 --> 02:26:13,830
It feels like it.

1951
02:26:15,068 --> 02:26:17,229
How can you go out
in this weather?

1952
02:26:17,437 --> 02:26:18,836
Gilliard's waiting.

1953
02:26:19,072 --> 02:26:21,540
And besides, I quite enjoy it.

1954
02:26:31,217 --> 02:26:33,651
That's the second time
this morning.

1955
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:37,146
There's so little else to do.
I keep forgetting.

1956
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:39,185
Aren’t you bored, Madame?

1957
02:26:41,027 --> 02:26:42,927
At times, I actually like it.

1958
02:26:43,129 --> 02:26:46,724
Mending clothes and teaching class
and quiet afternoons.

1959
02:26:47,167 --> 02:26:50,466
I doze and daydream
and I think about my life.

1960
02:26:52,806 --> 02:26:54,865
I don't know what I did wrong.

1961
02:26:56,543 --> 02:26:58,340
I'd feel better if I did.

1962
02:27:00,714 --> 02:27:02,477
Here, take it if it helps.

1963
02:27:22,002 --> 02:27:23,333
Christ!

1964
02:27:24,771 --> 02:27:26,329
I can't trust my own men.

1965
02:27:26,539 --> 02:27:28,302
Anything could set them off.

1966
02:27:28,808 --> 02:27:31,971
I don't give orders anymore.
I make suggestions.

1967
02:27:32,212 --> 02:27:33,839
They go and vote.

1968
02:27:34,848 --> 02:27:37,339
Tomorrow they could vote to hang me.

1969
02:27:37,751 --> 02:27:39,116
It's absurd.

1970
02:27:40,053 --> 02:27:41,020
They're decent boys.

1971
02:27:41,221 --> 02:27:43,121
They were once, but they're
lonely now.

1972
02:27:43,323 --> 02:27:45,757
Cold and scared to death.

1973
02:27:47,927 --> 02:27:49,360
Have you got any money?

1974
02:27:49,696 --> 02:27:50,754
Not much.

1975
02:27:51,164 --> 02:27:52,062
Why?

1976
02:27:52,432 --> 02:27:55,333
Has it crossed your mind I represent
a nonexistent government?

1977
02:27:55,535 --> 02:27:57,503
Who put me in this post,
gave me authority?

1978
02:27:57,704 --> 02:28:00,468
Whose money pays the troops?
Kerensky's gone.

1979
02:28:00,707 --> 02:28:02,902
The money's gone.
I haven't paid them in a month.

1980
02:28:03,109 --> 02:28:04,940
You think I should pay them?

1981
02:28:05,512 --> 02:28:07,571
The prisoners keep the guard.

1982
02:28:07,947 --> 02:28:10,211
I wish I'd had you
for my finance minister.

1983
02:28:10,417 --> 02:28:12,009
You'd have revolutionized
the penal system.

1984
02:28:12,218 --> 02:28:13,276
Don't laugh.

1985
02:28:13,486 --> 02:28:15,147
Shall I take the collection?

1986
02:28:15,588 --> 02:28:18,056
In Tobolsk, there
are rumors of civil war.

1987
02:28:18,258 --> 02:28:20,453
God only knows what's going on!

1988
02:28:21,294 --> 02:28:23,990
Out here, exposed like this.

1989
02:28:26,433 --> 02:28:28,731
That's not to keep you in here.

1990
02:28:29,069 --> 02:28:31,196
It's to keep them out.

1991
02:28:31,638 --> 02:28:32,468
Them?

1992
02:28:33,306 --> 02:28:35,831
- Who are you expecting?
- I don't know.

1993
02:28:37,043 --> 02:28:39,341
I hate this damned assignment!

1994
02:28:41,481 --> 02:28:43,506
I can't answer for your safety.

1995
02:28:44,117 --> 02:28:45,948
I can't do my job.

1996
02:28:47,887 --> 02:28:50,287
You care what happens to us,
don't you?

1997
02:28:51,791 --> 02:28:53,349
It's my job to.

1998
02:28:57,230 --> 02:28:58,788
What was that about?

1999
02:29:00,066 --> 02:29:02,125
Apparently there's a civil war.

2000
02:29:04,170 --> 02:29:05,762
I'm not surprised.

2001
02:29:06,573 --> 02:29:09,201
Too many people had too much to lose.

2002
02:29:09,609 --> 02:29:10,735
He's worried.

2003
02:29:11,678 --> 02:29:12,872
We all are.

2004
02:30:04,197 --> 02:30:05,528
Put it down, Vollinski.

2005
02:30:05,865 --> 02:30:06,854
Go to hell!

2006
02:30:08,368 --> 02:30:09,232
I'll shoot.

2007
02:30:16,376 --> 02:30:18,776
Monsieur Gilliard wants you
for your history lesson.

2008
02:30:18,978 --> 02:30:20,673
Don't keep him waiting.

2009
02:30:24,651 --> 02:30:26,175
You too, young man.

2010
02:30:26,653 --> 02:30:28,484
I'm fine. I'm fine.

2011
02:30:31,991 --> 02:30:33,458
- You're cut.
- Hands off!

2012
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:34,854
You'd better see the doctor.

2013
02:30:35,061 --> 02:30:36,585
I said, hands off!

2014
02:30:36,796 --> 02:30:39,026
Dr. Botkin hasn't had a thing
to do for weeks.

2015
02:30:39,232 --> 02:30:41,029
It's making him difficult
to live with.

2016
02:30:41,234 --> 02:30:42,929
You'd be doing us all a favor.

2017
02:30:44,103 --> 02:30:45,092
You dizzy?

2018
02:30:45,305 --> 02:30:46,897
I'm all right.

2019
02:30:47,106 --> 02:30:48,471
Come on, then.

2020
02:30:48,675 --> 02:30:50,165
My wife's a nurse.

2021
02:30:50,777 --> 02:30:52,642
They'll fix you up between them.

2022
02:31:25,311 --> 02:31:26,903
So that's how it's done.

2023
02:31:27,113 --> 02:31:29,138
I've never celebrated Easter
with real eggs.

2024
02:31:29,349 --> 02:31:32,147
When they dry, rub them with bacon fat
to make them shine.

2025
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:34,786
- I want to do the next one.
- I used to dread Easter.

2026
02:31:34,988 --> 02:31:38,947
I had to kiss the whole court
three times. Sixteen hundred people!

2027
02:31:39,192 --> 02:31:42,559
They used to line up to be kissed.
It puts you off kissing.

2028
02:31:44,998 --> 02:31:46,329
Christ has risen.

2029
02:31:46,532 --> 02:31:47,692
Christ has risen.

2030
02:31:52,906 --> 02:31:54,237
They've started to dance.

2031
02:31:54,440 --> 02:31:56,101
Can we see? Please!

2032
02:31:56,309 --> 02:31:57,503
- Come on.
- Let's!

2033
02:31:58,711 --> 02:32:00,144
Open the door.

2034
02:32:06,352 --> 02:32:08,149
They look so happy.

2035
02:32:08,421 --> 02:32:10,116
Let's go out to them.

2036
02:32:10,390 --> 02:32:11,652
I don't think we should.

2037
02:32:11,858 --> 02:32:13,052
Mother, please! Let's!

2038
02:32:57,603 --> 02:32:59,298
Go and join your sisters.

2039
02:33:00,573 --> 02:33:01,505
No.

2040
02:33:26,499 --> 02:33:29,866
- And authorizing transfer
of command to me.

2041
02:33:30,370 --> 02:33:32,736
By order of the Central
Committee in Moscow.

2042
02:33:33,339 --> 02:33:35,034
It seems in order, Commissar.

2043
02:33:36,009 --> 02:33:38,443
Are you at liberty to say
what Moscow wants them for?

2044
02:33:38,644 --> 02:33:40,271
No, Colonel, I can't tell you.

2045
02:33:40,646 --> 02:33:42,011
I don't know.

2046
02:33:42,982 --> 02:33:45,280
How soon can transport
for the prisoners be organized?

2047
02:33:45,485 --> 02:33:47,578
- What kind of transport?
- Anything that moves.

2048
02:33:47,787 --> 02:33:50,347
- Tomorrow sometime.
- Good. We leave tomorrow night.

2049
02:33:50,556 --> 02:33:51,818
May I know why?

2050
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,489
The civil war.

2051
02:33:55,962 --> 02:33:57,827
The Whites, they call themselves.

2052
02:33:58,031 --> 02:34:00,761
Conservatives and Monarchists
and Tsarist generals.

2053
02:34:00,967 --> 02:34:02,229
All our enemies.

2054
02:34:02,602 --> 02:34:04,502
They're moving towards Siberia.

2055
02:34:05,104 --> 02:34:06,469
They're powerful.

2056
02:34:06,672 --> 02:34:08,572
Our troops have yielded
half the Ukraine.

2057
02:34:08,775 --> 02:34:11,073
On all fronts, the revolution
is in danger.

2058
02:34:11,277 --> 02:34:12,801
And out here...

2059
02:34:13,112 --> 02:34:15,012
...it's open season
on your Romanovs.

2060
02:34:15,982 --> 02:34:17,279
I'll see them now.

2061
02:34:19,719 --> 02:34:21,687
Can't your government
protect us here?

2062
02:34:21,888 --> 02:34:23,412
We're so out of touch.

2063
02:34:23,623 --> 02:34:25,557
Has your government lost it...?

2064
02:34:36,202 --> 02:34:37,829
Has your government lost
its authority too?

2065
02:34:38,037 --> 02:34:41,268
My government is 3000 miles away.

2066
02:34:41,974 --> 02:34:44,408
Out here, they listen when they like.
When they don't...

2067
02:34:44,610 --> 02:34:45,872
...the lines go dead.

2068
02:34:47,046 --> 02:34:49,981
The Ural Soviet has ordered
your arrest.

2069
02:34:50,183 --> 02:34:53,744
They have a prison, just for you,
in Ekaterinburg.

2070
02:34:53,953 --> 02:34:55,853
You're less than
popular out here.

2071
02:34:56,322 --> 02:34:59,120
Am I beloved in Moscow?

2072
02:34:59,692 --> 02:35:02,684
Do they want me for a
public trial? Is that it?

2073
02:35:03,362 --> 02:35:05,956
And when they find me
guilty, what then?

2074
02:35:06,432 --> 02:35:09,458
They can roast you on a spit
for all I care.

2075
02:35:10,303 --> 02:35:13,136
My duty is to
get you there intact.

2076
02:35:13,806 --> 02:35:15,899
From now on, strict security
will be observed.

2077
02:35:16,109 --> 02:35:18,077
You're confined to this house
until we leave.

2078
02:35:18,311 --> 02:35:19,869
I'll have him first.

2079
02:35:42,535 --> 02:35:43,729
I'm sorry.

2080
02:35:44,670 --> 02:35:46,900
He's an educated man,
at any rate.

2081
02:35:47,406 --> 02:35:49,567
They could have sent an executioner.

2082
02:35:49,909 --> 02:35:50,807
Father?

2083
02:35:51,711 --> 02:35:53,338
There's no hope, is there?

2084
02:35:56,516 --> 02:35:57,380
Nonsense.

2085
02:35:58,217 --> 02:35:59,616
None at all.

2086
02:36:04,457 --> 02:36:05,287
Sit.

2087
02:36:05,925 --> 02:36:07,483
May I ask why?

2088
02:36:08,728 --> 02:36:10,491
Surely my features are familiar?

2089
02:36:10,730 --> 02:36:12,630
Front face and profile.

2090
02:36:13,533 --> 02:36:14,761
Sit down!

2091
02:36:24,143 --> 02:36:25,610
Look at me! It's just awful.

2092
02:36:25,811 --> 02:36:26,937
You look like a thief.

2093
02:36:27,146 --> 02:36:28,443
You look like a trollop.

2094
02:36:28,648 --> 02:36:30,912
I don't. What's a trollop?

2095
02:36:31,617 --> 02:36:33,482
Dear Lord, so she does!

2096
02:36:33,953 --> 02:36:35,784
- I don't find that amusing.
- Just look.

2097
02:36:35,988 --> 02:36:37,683
It's not amusing at all.

2098
02:37:35,581 --> 02:37:37,344
The girls won't stop crying.

2099
02:37:37,550 --> 02:37:38,642
How is he?

2100
02:37:39,852 --> 02:37:41,080
I don't know.

2101
02:37:41,721 --> 02:37:43,086
It's not as bad as some.

2102
02:37:43,289 --> 02:37:45,553
The knee will go on swelling
for a bit.

2103
02:37:45,758 --> 02:37:48,352
It may be weeks before
he walks again.

2104
02:37:48,861 --> 02:37:50,089
But he'll mend.

2105
02:37:50,997 --> 02:37:52,089
Mend!

2106
02:37:57,837 --> 02:37:59,304
I'm all right, Father.

2107
02:38:00,006 --> 02:38:03,237
- Botkin tells me you'll be fine.
- I tripped.

2108
02:38:03,542 --> 02:38:05,442
I don't believe you.

2109
02:38:06,212 --> 02:38:09,181
I ought to sleep.
They told me to get some rest.

2110
02:38:09,382 --> 02:38:12,442
We are going God knows why
to God knows where...

2111
02:38:12,652 --> 02:38:14,119
...and you do this!

2112
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:16,413
I have a family to protect.

2113
02:38:18,491 --> 02:38:20,220
What are you doing for them?

2114
02:38:20,459 --> 02:38:22,188
What did you ever do?

2115
02:38:22,862 --> 02:38:25,831
You abdicated, you gave in!
I thought Tsars had to die!

2116
02:38:26,065 --> 02:38:26,963
I did it for you.

2117
02:38:27,166 --> 02:38:28,963
- You could have fought.
- For you?

2118
02:38:29,268 --> 02:38:30,462
I'm so ashamed of you.

2119
02:38:31,304 --> 02:38:34,239
Look at us!
Look where you've put us.

2120
02:38:36,642 --> 02:38:37,973
Thinking back...

2121
02:38:40,446 --> 02:38:43,609
When I think back, I can see
them so clearly now...

2122
02:38:44,283 --> 02:38:46,410
...corners that I didn't turn.

2123
02:38:48,521 --> 02:38:50,284
You've had no life.

2124
02:38:51,557 --> 02:38:53,821
The girls have had no life.

2125
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:56,418
I wasted you.

2126
02:38:57,263 --> 02:39:00,096
I had your future in my hands
and spent it.

2127
02:39:01,567 --> 02:39:03,034
Look at you.

2128
02:39:03,903 --> 02:39:05,768
You're all I see.

2129
02:39:05,971 --> 02:39:07,268
Your faces.

2130
02:39:08,074 --> 02:39:10,634
Why did you abdicate for me?

2131
02:39:10,843 --> 02:39:13,641
Why?
You didn't even ask.

2132
02:39:14,046 --> 02:39:15,673
I didn't want you to pay
for my mistakes.

2133
02:39:16,248 --> 02:39:18,216
Am I not paying for them now?

2134
02:39:18,417 --> 02:39:19,884
Aren’t all of us?

2135
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:23,218
I should have had a chance...

2136
02:39:23,422 --> 02:39:27,415
...the right to live my own life,
make my own decisions.

2137
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:29,894
I could have tried to help Russia...

2138
02:39:30,596 --> 02:39:33,929
...help Mother and my sisters,
and perhaps, even you.

2139
02:39:34,734 --> 02:39:37,066
I could have been a Romanov...

2140
02:39:37,269 --> 02:39:38,395
...a Tsar.

2141
02:39:39,772 --> 02:39:41,831
It all went wrong.

2142
02:39:43,008 --> 02:39:45,238
I hardly know why or how.

2143
02:39:46,846 --> 02:39:49,007
Instead, I just bleed.

2144
02:39:49,548 --> 02:39:51,038
It's my fate.

2145
02:39:51,250 --> 02:39:52,376
I bleed.

2146
02:39:54,420 --> 02:39:55,887
I love you.

2147
02:39:57,456 --> 02:39:59,321
Please understand.

2148
02:40:01,160 --> 02:40:02,855
I do, Father.

2149
02:40:04,797 --> 02:40:06,731
But does it really matter?

2150
02:40:13,105 --> 02:40:14,129
Goodbye.

2151
02:40:15,408 --> 02:40:16,898
What will you do now?

2152
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:18,738
What can I do?

2153
02:40:18,944 --> 02:40:21,378
Whatever side I join,
I kill Russians.

2154
02:40:22,047 --> 02:40:23,674
I don't know what
to do anymore.

2155
02:40:23,883 --> 02:40:25,009
We're ready.

2156
02:40:29,121 --> 02:40:31,089
What a world this is.

2157
02:40:32,458 --> 02:40:33,288
God bless you.

2158
02:40:34,460 --> 02:40:36,018
It's too late for that.

2159
02:40:37,897 --> 02:40:38,864
But thank you.

2160
02:40:54,747 --> 02:40:56,772
Are you all right?
Does it hurt?

2161
02:40:56,982 --> 02:40:57,880
Would you like it to?

2162
02:40:58,083 --> 02:40:59,072
Not at all.

2163
02:40:59,285 --> 02:41:01,276
Why are you moving a sick boy?
It's inhuman.

2164
02:41:01,487 --> 02:41:03,580
I am just taking you to Moscow,
that's all.

2165
02:41:03,789 --> 02:41:05,154
And what happens to us there?

2166
02:41:05,357 --> 02:41:06,187
Get in.

2167
02:41:06,392 --> 02:41:09,293
And pray that when we get out of here,
there'll be a train.

2168
02:42:12,625 --> 02:42:14,320
How long till Moscow?

2169
02:42:14,627 --> 02:42:16,094
Five or six days.

2170
02:42:18,297 --> 02:42:19,662
What are our chances?

2171
02:42:19,865 --> 02:42:20,695
Of what?

2172
02:42:21,233 --> 02:42:22,825
Living till Christmas?

2173
02:42:23,035 --> 02:42:24,798
I haven't thought about it.

2174
02:42:25,971 --> 02:42:27,404
You puzzle me.

2175
02:42:28,073 --> 02:42:31,008
You'd be happy to see us dead,
and yet you help us get away.

2176
02:42:31,210 --> 02:42:33,644
I haven't your taste for murder,
Bloody Nicholas.

2177
02:42:33,846 --> 02:42:35,871
I've never had a chance
to get used to it.

2178
02:42:36,482 --> 02:42:39,940
How many men have you killed?
Have you the least idea?

2179
02:42:40,853 --> 02:42:43,287
God knows how many peasants died!

2180
02:42:43,989 --> 02:42:46,014
Nobody counted children.

2181
02:42:46,592 --> 02:42:50,551
You only know the number of soldiers
because somebody counted them for you.

2182
02:42:50,829 --> 02:42:52,660
Seven million!

2183
02:42:54,366 --> 02:42:57,301
Six quarts a man
times seven million.

2184
02:42:58,203 --> 02:42:59,670
It's an ocean.

2185
02:43:02,274 --> 02:43:04,242
You ever seen a battle?

2186
02:43:07,046 --> 02:43:09,571
I'm wrong. You're not
Bloody Nicholas.

2187
02:43:10,783 --> 02:43:13,377
You're a man of no imagination.

2188
02:43:26,832 --> 02:43:28,424
Fit for a king.

2189
02:43:47,052 --> 02:43:49,077
Comrade Commissar!

2190
02:43:49,722 --> 02:43:51,815
Comrade Commissar!

2191
02:44:07,239 --> 02:44:10,936
Greetings from the Ural Soviet
at Ekaterinburg, comrade.

2192
02:44:11,143 --> 02:44:14,601
I have an order authorizing me
to take charge of your prisoners.

2193
02:44:16,281 --> 02:44:17,248
From the Ural Soviet.

2194
02:44:17,783 --> 02:44:20,183
My orders come from
the Central Committee in Moscow.

2195
02:44:20,386 --> 02:44:22,445
I'm not in your jurisdiction.
Move your train.

2196
02:44:22,821 --> 02:44:25,585
I want the Romanovs.
I have a legal order for them.

2197
02:44:25,791 --> 02:44:28,919
There's only one legal government
in Soviet Russia.

2198
02:44:29,128 --> 02:44:31,187
One government? Where is it?

2199
02:44:31,964 --> 02:44:33,431
What's it doing?

2200
02:44:33,866 --> 02:44:35,731
They're losing to the Whites!

2201
02:44:36,068 --> 02:44:37,695
They've taken Omsk.

2202
02:44:37,903 --> 02:44:40,098
And they're coming here
to save your Tsar!

2203
02:44:40,305 --> 02:44:42,102
Can your Central Committee
stop them?

2204
02:44:42,307 --> 02:44:44,707
He's not my Tsar.
He's my responsibility.

2205
02:44:45,010 --> 02:44:47,535
I'm not saving him,
I'm taking him to trial.

2206
02:44:47,746 --> 02:44:50,476
We must stay inside the law!
We're not the Okrana.

2207
02:44:50,683 --> 02:44:53,174
That's why we had
a revolution, comrade.

2208
02:44:54,753 --> 02:44:55,947
We're going through.

2209
02:44:56,522 --> 02:44:57,352
Try.

2210
02:44:59,391 --> 02:45:01,018
I'll shoot you.

2211
02:45:02,795 --> 02:45:04,854
And I'll get a medal for it.

2212
02:45:14,406 --> 02:45:16,306
Mine or Moscow's, Commissar?

2213
02:45:17,376 --> 02:45:19,674
Whose legal orders do you take?

2214
02:46:36,889 --> 02:46:37,947
Get away!

2215
02:46:47,266 --> 02:46:48,198
Get in!

2216
02:46:53,872 --> 02:46:54,998
What are you doing?

2217
02:46:55,207 --> 02:46:57,402
Only Russians in the truck.
You're Swiss neutrals.

2218
02:46:57,609 --> 02:46:59,668
- They're with us.
- I've got my orders.

2219
02:46:59,878 --> 02:47:00,970
Get in!

2220
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:03,078
<i>Monsieur</i> Gilliard!

2221
02:47:03,282 --> 02:47:04,408
I'll write!

2222
02:47:04,783 --> 02:47:07,047
I'll try to see you!

2223
02:47:10,522 --> 02:47:11,454
Come on.

2224
02:47:12,324 --> 02:47:13,689
Get out! Come on!

2225
02:47:15,494 --> 02:47:17,052
Hurry up! Come on!

2226
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:33,202
You must be very tired.

2227
02:47:33,478 --> 02:47:34,911
Come inside...

2228
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:36,947
...and get dry.

2229
02:48:23,028 --> 02:48:24,655
Is today your birthday?

2230
02:48:26,131 --> 02:48:27,792
That was weeks ago.

2231
02:48:28,467 --> 02:48:29,934
Of course it was.

2232
02:48:30,402 --> 02:48:31,869
And mine too.

2233
02:48:32,471 --> 02:48:33,563
I was 46.

2234
02:48:34,106 --> 02:48:35,334
Imagine that.

2235
02:48:35,908 --> 02:48:36,875
Breakfast?

2236
02:48:37,676 --> 02:48:40,042
I'm not hungry. You eat it.

2237
02:48:40,646 --> 02:48:41,670
Nor am I.

2238
02:48:43,282 --> 02:48:44,715
What's the day like?

2239
02:48:45,017 --> 02:48:46,484
I don't know now.

2240
02:48:48,153 --> 02:48:49,677
It doesn't matter.

2241
02:48:50,923 --> 02:48:52,481
It goes on and on.

2242
02:48:54,526 --> 02:48:56,153
I don't know anymore.

2243
02:48:57,763 --> 02:49:00,027
What can God have in mind for us?

2244
02:49:02,134 --> 02:49:03,396
They've left a crack!

2245
02:49:03,602 --> 02:49:04,626
What difference does it make?

2246
02:49:04,836 --> 02:49:07,805
- Look. Something might happen.
- What?

2247
02:49:08,006 --> 02:49:09,598
Something might.

2248
02:49:18,317 --> 02:49:19,841
Go away!

2249
02:49:22,387 --> 02:49:23,979
What do you want?

2250
02:49:25,891 --> 02:49:27,552
Do you want to see me?

2251
02:49:28,827 --> 02:49:30,021
Is that it?

2252
02:49:44,142 --> 02:49:48,476
I'm 21 and I'm pretty.
Everyone says I'm pretty.

2253
02:49:48,814 --> 02:49:52,306
- That's the only man who's seen me!
- I know, it's all right.

2254
02:49:52,517 --> 02:49:54,417
He's gone, he's gone.

2255
02:49:56,154 --> 02:49:57,781
You know what's funny?

2256
02:49:59,324 --> 02:50:01,383
I wanted to ask him in.

2257
02:50:03,495 --> 02:50:05,053
Just once...

2258
02:50:06,665 --> 02:50:08,690
...I wanted somebody.

2259
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:27,975
What is the Ural Soviet up to?

2260
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:30,688
The Whites are three days away.

2261
02:50:30,889 --> 02:50:33,517
- Can't you make up your minds?
- All right, comrade.

2262
02:50:33,725 --> 02:50:36,091
We've had fresh instructions
from the Kremlin.

2263
02:50:36,294 --> 02:50:39,752
They express confidence in our
ability to handle this difficult...

2264
02:50:39,965 --> 02:50:42,490
What exactly did they say?

2265
02:50:42,701 --> 02:50:43,861
Let me see.

2266
02:50:44,336 --> 02:50:45,633
I've committed it to memory.

2267
02:50:45,837 --> 02:50:49,068
The cable read: "We leave
the matter in your hands."

2268
02:50:49,408 --> 02:50:52,036
Well, that's taking a position,
isn't it?

2269
02:50:52,878 --> 02:50:54,675
Now, what are my orders?

2270
02:50:54,880 --> 02:50:58,782
It's my duty as a member of the
Ural Presidium to act as an observer...

2271
02:50:58,984 --> 02:51:00,815
Observer? Of what?

2272
02:51:01,019 --> 02:51:01,951
The execution.

2273
02:51:02,154 --> 02:51:03,587
That's already decided.

2274
02:51:03,789 --> 02:51:05,347
The question now is, how many?

2275
02:51:05,557 --> 02:51:07,548
You're having a debate on it?

2276
02:51:07,759 --> 02:51:09,989
Everything must be above reproach.

2277
02:51:10,195 --> 02:51:12,254
We hope to bring it
to a vote this afternoon.

2278
02:51:12,464 --> 02:51:16,161
There's a division of opinion about
the children. But as for the Tsar...

2279
02:51:20,505 --> 02:51:22,370
Was it necessary to remove the view?

2280
02:51:22,574 --> 02:51:23,700
Security.

2281
02:51:27,179 --> 02:51:28,237
Good day.

2282
02:51:28,480 --> 02:51:29,447
Good day.

2283
02:51:46,898 --> 02:51:48,365
No sun today?

2284
02:51:49,534 --> 02:51:50,865
What a shame.

2285
02:51:51,636 --> 02:51:53,797
I suppose you're not well enough.

2286
02:51:54,639 --> 02:51:56,470
What's it like being ill?

2287
02:51:58,110 --> 02:52:00,340
What's it like having gray eyes?

2288
02:52:00,946 --> 02:52:02,277
It can't be nice...

2289
02:52:02,681 --> 02:52:05,275
...being an invalid at your age.

2290
02:52:05,617 --> 02:52:08,643
And they can't do anything
to help one.

2291
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:10,850
What a pity.

2292
02:53:11,783 --> 02:53:12,613
It's gold!

2293
02:53:12,817 --> 02:53:14,216
Let it go!

2294
02:53:40,612 --> 02:53:41,601
You're dead!

2295
02:53:42,113 --> 02:53:43,705
That's all you know about.

2296
02:53:43,915 --> 02:53:45,177
You murder everything!

2297
02:53:45,383 --> 02:53:47,146
You hurt him, and by God...

2298
02:53:48,220 --> 02:53:49,619
You struck the Tsar!

2299
02:54:01,433 --> 02:54:02,900
Bring him outside!

2300
02:54:04,502 --> 02:54:06,493
First thing each morning...

2301
02:54:06,805 --> 02:54:07,999
...put Alexis' brace on.

2302
02:54:08,206 --> 02:54:09,468
I won't let them hurt you!

2303
02:54:09,674 --> 02:54:11,266
Strap it on tight,
Your Majesty.

2304
02:54:11,476 --> 02:54:14,639
He doesn't like it,
but it's good for him.

2305
02:54:15,046 --> 02:54:16,240
Dear God!

2306
02:54:20,552 --> 02:54:22,019
I won't let them.

2307
02:54:45,410 --> 02:54:47,002
You can save him.

2308
02:54:47,445 --> 02:54:48,537
You can stop it.

2309
02:54:48,913 --> 02:54:49,880
Certainly.

2310
02:54:50,115 --> 02:54:53,050
Your man started it.
He should be punished.

2311
02:54:53,251 --> 02:54:54,343
He will be.

2312
02:54:54,552 --> 02:54:55,610
And Nagorny?

2313
02:54:57,622 --> 02:54:59,283
Taking someone's life.

2314
02:55:00,325 --> 02:55:01,656
No man should have that power.

2315
02:55:02,460 --> 02:55:03,859
You had it.

2316
02:55:04,129 --> 02:55:04,993
Yes.

2317
02:55:06,998 --> 02:55:10,798
And I have learned that a strong man
has no need of power.

2318
02:55:11,002 --> 02:55:13,436
And a weak man is destroyed by it.

2319
02:55:14,739 --> 02:55:17,503
I am being punished
for what I have done.

2320
02:55:18,176 --> 02:55:20,110
Nagorny is innocent.

2321
02:55:20,312 --> 02:55:21,745
He's like a child.

2322
02:55:22,047 --> 02:55:24,140
You don't shoot children, do you?

2323
02:55:24,416 --> 02:55:27,010
In your new world,
are there penalties for innocence?

2324
02:55:27,385 --> 02:55:28,511
Sometimes.

2325
02:55:31,690 --> 02:55:34,921
It takes a wise judge
to know who is innocent...

2326
02:55:35,727 --> 02:55:37,251
...and who is guilty.

2327
02:55:38,630 --> 02:55:40,222
I wish I knew.

2328
02:55:43,735 --> 02:55:45,202
I'll do what I can.

2329
02:55:46,504 --> 02:55:47,368
Thank you.

2330
02:55:54,546 --> 02:55:56,741
I'd like to kill him.

2331
02:55:57,549 --> 02:55:59,016
Wait and see.

2332
02:56:00,085 --> 02:56:01,279
He'll do what's right.

2333
02:56:01,553 --> 02:56:02,952
I know him. He's a murderer.

2334
02:56:03,154 --> 02:56:04,519
He's a thoughtful man.

2335
02:56:04,723 --> 02:56:06,554
He'll send Nagorny back to us.

2336
02:56:06,758 --> 02:56:08,089
He's not a monster.

2337
02:56:09,294 --> 02:56:12,127
I've never known a heart
without some murder in it.

2338
02:56:13,565 --> 02:56:15,157
I made these men.

2339
02:56:16,067 --> 02:56:17,898
They are our Russians.

2340
02:56:18,303 --> 02:56:20,464
I am responsible for what they are.

2341
02:56:20,939 --> 02:56:22,406
I let them starve.

2342
02:56:22,674 --> 02:56:25,234
I put them in prisons
and I shot them.

2343
02:56:26,378 --> 02:56:28,209
If there's hatred in them now...

2344
02:56:28,413 --> 02:56:30,108
...I put it there.

2345
02:56:31,616 --> 02:56:34,642
But they are filled with love.

2346
02:56:35,086 --> 02:56:36,553
And with mercy too.

2347
02:56:37,455 --> 02:56:39,047
You must remember that.

2348
02:56:39,257 --> 02:56:41,521
They are all murderers.

2349
02:56:47,465 --> 02:56:49,831
I'd like to kill them all.

2350
02:57:00,779 --> 02:57:02,576
Acid? Gasoline?

2351
02:57:02,847 --> 02:57:04,974
Can't you just throw them
down the mineshaft?

2352
02:57:05,183 --> 02:57:07,549
You don't approve of this, comrade?

2353
02:57:07,752 --> 02:57:09,515
No, I quite approve...

2354
02:57:09,721 --> 02:57:13,122
...of terror, arson, murder.
Any tool that serves the revolution.

2355
02:57:13,324 --> 02:57:17,192
As a member of the Ural Presidium,
it's my duty to see that...

2356
02:57:36,481 --> 02:57:38,278
They must hurt very much.

2357
02:57:38,917 --> 02:57:40,077
My fingers.

2358
02:57:41,419 --> 02:57:43,512
They work well enough for this.

2359
02:57:44,389 --> 02:57:46,186
I couldn't play the piano now.

2360
02:57:47,058 --> 02:57:49,458
I used to hear you practicing
when I was in my office.

2361
02:57:49,661 --> 02:57:50,559
Did you?

2362
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:53,695
Schumann and Schubert.

2363
02:57:54,632 --> 02:57:56,497
I never thought much
of your voice.

2364
02:57:56,734 --> 02:57:57,758
Didn’t you?

2365
02:57:59,771 --> 02:58:01,636
Never told me that before.

2366
02:58:02,507 --> 02:58:05,169
I suddenly thought of
the yacht this morning.

2367
02:58:05,844 --> 02:58:08,506
Remember how the band
used to play all the time?

2368
02:58:09,547 --> 02:58:11,037
And out of tune.

2369
02:58:11,549 --> 02:58:12,880
Do you think they drank?

2370
02:58:13,084 --> 02:58:14,711
How did that waltz go?

2371
02:58:22,727 --> 02:58:24,592
You're no better than the band.

2372
02:58:54,259 --> 02:58:55,886
Your beautiful hands.

2373
02:59:00,298 --> 02:59:01,492
The girls.

2374
02:59:03,101 --> 02:59:04,568
They won't come in.

2375
02:59:05,236 --> 02:59:06,362
We're alone.

2376
02:59:08,072 --> 02:59:09,835
I still want you so much.

2377
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:13,574
Nothing can change that, Sunny.

2378
02:59:15,079 --> 02:59:16,410
I do love you.

2379
02:59:33,164 --> 02:59:34,893
I'm sure it's getting nearer.

2380
02:59:35,099 --> 02:59:36,293
How far now?

2381
02:59:38,436 --> 02:59:40,028
It's hard to tell.

2382
02:59:41,606 --> 02:59:43,096
Perhaps thirty miles.

2383
02:59:43,942 --> 02:59:45,239
Thirty miles.

2384
02:59:52,350 --> 02:59:54,341
They've been here all morning.

2385
02:59:54,752 --> 02:59:56,310
Why don't they go away?

2386
03:00:10,935 --> 03:00:12,630
Can't they make up their minds?

2387
03:00:14,339 --> 03:00:15,931
I'm sure it's getting nearer.

2388
03:00:18,343 --> 03:00:19,742
I'm going to phone again.

2389
03:00:30,455 --> 03:00:31,285
Go on.

2390
03:00:39,430 --> 03:00:40,294
It's all of them.

2391
03:00:40,665 --> 03:00:42,462
I could have told you that.

2392
03:00:43,668 --> 03:00:44,965
It's about time.

2393
03:00:47,372 --> 03:00:48,862
I kept their mail.

2394
03:00:49,073 --> 03:00:51,507
I didn't know whether
they ought to have it.

2395
03:00:51,743 --> 03:00:53,677
Shall I give it to them now?

2396
03:00:53,878 --> 03:00:55,743
Would it be cruel...

2397
03:00:56,147 --> 03:00:57,910
...or kind?

2398
03:00:58,149 --> 03:01:01,016
I don't know how to judge
these things.

2399
03:01:01,886 --> 03:01:04,116
I don't think anyone knows.

2400
03:01:11,062 --> 03:01:12,029
Listen.

2401
03:01:12,230 --> 03:01:13,595
Nikolasha writes:

2402
03:01:13,798 --> 03:01:16,358
"Saw Vladimir walking in
the Nevsky Prospect.

2403
03:01:16,567 --> 03:01:19,764
Old fool, all dressed up
in his Imperial gold uniform.

2404
03:01:20,405 --> 03:01:22,032
Nobody seems to mind."

2405
03:01:23,675 --> 03:01:25,074
Listen to Grandmama:

2406
03:01:25,276 --> 03:01:26,743
"Remember to dress for dinner.

2407
03:01:26,944 --> 03:01:30,505
It keeps up one's dignity
and impresses the people."

2408
03:01:30,715 --> 03:01:32,182
Dress for dinner?

2409
03:01:32,383 --> 03:01:34,977
Nikolasha says he'll
join her soon in the Crimea.

2410
03:01:35,186 --> 03:01:36,175
Vladimir.

2411
03:01:36,387 --> 03:01:38,855
He says:
"<i>Ma chère</i>, I've seen this Lenin.

2412
03:01:39,057 --> 03:01:41,048
His suit is wrinkled
and he wears a worker's cap.

2413
03:01:41,259 --> 03:01:43,193
The man will never make a Tsar."

2414
03:01:43,628 --> 03:01:45,528
<i>Monsieur</i> Gilliard's still
in Ekaterinburg.

2415
03:01:45,730 --> 03:01:47,459
He's trying to come and see us.

2416
03:01:47,665 --> 03:01:50,259
Mama's off to England
in a month or so.

2417
03:01:50,635 --> 03:01:52,660
She says the spring
was late this year...

2418
03:01:53,004 --> 03:01:54,301
...but very beautiful.

2419
03:01:57,075 --> 03:01:59,305
Lord, but it's good to be alive!

2420
03:02:01,546 --> 03:02:04,106
The world is like a field in summer...

2421
03:02:04,315 --> 03:02:06,215
...bursting with good things.

2422
03:02:06,584 --> 03:02:07,414
One day...

2423
03:02:08,419 --> 03:02:10,319
...when all the wars are over...

2424
03:02:10,955 --> 03:02:13,480
...someone young will
lead us to the harvest.

2425
03:02:14,592 --> 03:02:16,287
As long as there are children...

2426
03:02:16,561 --> 03:02:18,529
...anything is possible.

2427
03:02:49,060 --> 03:02:49,958
What's happened?

2428
03:02:50,194 --> 03:02:52,321
Get your family dressed.

2429
03:02:52,530 --> 03:02:54,225
- Why?
- We're leaving.

2430
03:02:59,937 --> 03:03:01,063
Don't be afraid.

2431
03:03:01,272 --> 03:03:03,536
The White Army
must have broken through.

2432
03:03:03,741 --> 03:03:05,231
Help Anastasia.

2433
03:04:02,433 --> 03:04:04,060
Wait in here, please.

2434
03:04:05,305 --> 03:05:05,422
