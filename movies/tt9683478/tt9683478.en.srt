00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:47,416
It's nice...

468
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,458
to make a new friend, though.

469
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:51,416
Oh.

470
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:52,458
A friend.

471
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,583
Good.

472
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,583
They use Reddi-wip.

473
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,458
Oh.

474
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,958
It's, uh... from a can.

475
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,416
Uh... but it's okay.

476
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,041
[sighs heavily]

477
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,875
[Paul] <i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

478
00:27:22,958 --> 00:27:26,000
What about that date wasn't bad?
You have nothing in common.

479
00:27:26,083 --> 00:27:27,000
Not yet, but...

480
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,166
Game over.

481
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,541
[Paul panting] I can't give up.

482
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:32,041
[Ellie] Look, you and Aster Flores,
not gonna happen.

483
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:40,250
- [boy] Chugga chugga Chu Chu!
- [Paul] Hey!

484
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,470
- Who are you calling "Chu Chu"?
- [boy] Shit, let's get out of here!

485
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,916
[Paul] What kind of wusses say dumb shit
and then drive away?

486
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,500
Yeah, you'd better run!

487
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,291
What?

488
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,000
[Ellie] Aster Flores thinks
you're into abstract art

489
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:02,708
and repressed British literature.

490
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,375
- Yeah.
- None of that is you.

491
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:07,416
It could be. I started reading
that <i>Remains Of The Day </i>book.

492
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,041
- Really?
- Yeah. I fell asleep a few times,

493
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,541
but I'm still reading it.

494
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,291
That's gotta count for something.

495
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,375
There are no points for effort.

496
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:20,083
Isn't that what love is? How much effort
you put into loving someone?

497
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,000
[thunder rumbles]

498
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,083
Well, whatever love is,

499
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,246
- we just blew it with Aster Flores.
- [phone chimes]

500
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:37,791
Yes!

501
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:42,166
No, I can do this.

502
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:44,333
We can do this.

503
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,875
[rain pattering on roof]

504
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,250
Okay.

505
00:28:52,583 --> 00:28:53,583
I'll pay you double.

506
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,208
You don't have to pay me.

507
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,666
Don't be weird, dude.
Why else would you do this?

508
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,458
No, I've got savings.

509
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:03,333
[Ellie] Next date is three weeks away.

510
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,059
- Three weeks?
- You told her you're slammed

511
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,916
- with football training.
- I... I did?

512
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,267
Yes. Also, you're in a debate
on who's the better Hepburn.

513
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,291
[Mr. Chu] Who there?

514
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,250
[in Mandarin] Ba, did we wake you?

515
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:15,875
School project.

516
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:17,666
Hi, Ellie Chu's dad.

517
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,184
We don't have time to school you
on everything Aster thinks you are,

518
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,625
so we have to be selective.
Deep versus broad-based learning.

519
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,083
- Huh?
<i>- </i>We spy on her,

520
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,750
then cram you on her greatest hits.

521
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh, cool.

522
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,833
- Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

523
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,083
[hushed] Are you ready for this?

524
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,083
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

525
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:37,000
Shh!

526
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:39,416
So, in <i>No Exit,</i>
three people are trapped in hell.

527
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,041
A door opens, but nobody leaves.

528
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,083
[Paul]
That's nuts. He can't stand these people.

529
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,750
A door opens and he doesn't leave?

530
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:48,184
[Ellie] He's trapped in hell.
It's a metaphor for existence.

531
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,041
[Paul] My nana hated Minnesota. She left.

532
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,767
[Ellie] Your nana wasn't one of
the great thinkers of the 20th century.

533
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,333
- [Paul] Nana's not trapped in hell either.
- [Ellie groans]

534
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:57,625
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

535
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:03,333
The hell's got into Munsky?

536
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:09,750
<i>You're like some marvelous, distant,
well, queen, I guess.</i>

537
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:11,791
<i>You're so cool and fine.</i>

538
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:14,875
[Hepburn] <i>I don't want to be worshiped,
I want to be loved.</i>

539
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:17,666
Key thing about <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>
is it's a plea for tolerance.

540
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,270
Check this out. I'm calling it
taco sausage. Do you want a bite?

541
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,916
No. So tolerance...

542
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,291
Two hand foods, one great taste.

543
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,916
Conversation is like ping-pong.

544
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,666
I hit one and then you...

545
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
What the...

546
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:32,625
Oops.

547
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,291
[crowd groans]

548
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,041
- [screaming]
- [giggling]

549
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,291
[crowd gasps]

550
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,958
- [crowd groans, shrieks]
- [Aster continues giggling]

551
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:48,041
[instrumental spy music playing]

552
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,958
We're writing a profile
on the student we most admire.

553
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:27,500
Oh, cool, cool.

554
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:30,103
- Views on women in the workplace?
- Does Aster like lean meats?

555
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,583
[both] What are you doing?

556
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:33,791
- I'm good cop.
- Then how come you aren't smiling?

557
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,041
I'll smile when you follow the plan
that I carefully...

558
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,208
I'm surprised more kids
haven't asked to interview me. Huh.

559
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,916
I'm going in.
I'm going in with my smile.

560
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,833
[announcer]
<i>Looks like The Moose have a man open.</i>

561
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,083
<i>Oh!</i>

562
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,583
[Paul] You're not hungry?

563
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,916
Not if it's not time to eat.

564
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,208
Now that's weird.

565
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,958
Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

566
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,541
I don't want to try a taco sausage.

567
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,375
Why Squahamish?

568
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:35,083
Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy.

569
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,583
- I gotta go.
- No, no, no, wait.

570
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:40,833
No, you're not taking this seriously.
I have a ton of work I have to do.

571
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,333
No, just, you're so smart.
Like, too smart to, like...

572
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:45,976
Waste my time trying to win you a girl
who'll never look your way?

573
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,666
- No, it just seems weird.
- You're weird!

574
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,750
No... Yes.

575
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,750
- Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish.
- No, no...

576
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:56,083
The thing about <i>No Exit </i>is it's like how
what I really want is to run my own shop,

577
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,916
with new recipes. And... And FYI,
taco sausage is really effing good.

578
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,458
Okay, but I'm the fourth son

579
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,833
and my family's been making
the same sausage for 49 years

580
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,356
and it doesn't matter
if they're going broke, or out of style,

581
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,333
they're Nana's recipes.

582
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,684
If Ma can't have Nana,
at least she can make her sausages.

583
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:12,628
If I break away, it'll break her heart.
And it's either her heart or mine.

584
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,333
[panting]

585
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:15,416
So I stay.

586
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,666
[Ellie scoffs]

587
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,208
[sighs heavily]

588
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,208
We had to go
where my dad could get a job.

589
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,500
He studied trains?

590
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,083
Engineering.

591
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,333
PhD, no less.

592
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,041
So, uh,

593
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,625
he became the station manager
at Squahamish.

594
00:33:53,708 --> 00:33:54,708
To start.

595
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,250
The plan was to be promoted
to system engineer.

596
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,541
Or anything engineer.

597
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,166
Squahamish was a jumping-off point.

598
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,000
It turns out speaking good English
trumps having a PhD.

599
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,583
Or one from China anyway.

600
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,875
And my dad, he...

601
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:15,291
Doesn't speak very good.

602
00:34:15,833 --> 00:34:18,666
- He's not bad.
- I don't speak very good either.

603
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:22,875
True.

604
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:25,708
What's your excuse?

605
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,375
How do you feel about pot roast?

606
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,791
I should get back to the station.

607
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:40,458
I know, but we've gotta eat.

608
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,291
[sighs]

609
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,684
- [engine starts]
- [boy] <i>Mom!</i>

610
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,375
[girl] Tommy, stop friending my friends!

611
00:34:47,458 --> 00:34:51,000
Would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal?

612
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,916
I'll deal with the dog wrestling.

613
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,708
- Mom!
- It's your fault!

614
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,791
[overlapping shouts]

615
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,458
[Paul] Or we could go to your place?

and just say one thing.

620
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:34,625
Where were you born?

621
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:35,958
In Squahamish.

622
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,166
What about you?

623
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,375
Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard.
