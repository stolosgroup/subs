2
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,788
I must admit,

3
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:26,376
I've been seeing another shrink
while consulting you, I confess.

4
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,725
I would like to know,
when my life started to crack.

5
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,143
Mr.Adelaoui, stop harassing me.

6
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:28,855
I need to work on the file, do you understand? Thank you.

7
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:31,192
Hi girls.
Hello.

8
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:32,301
Are you well?

9
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,477
I quit.
What?

10
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,654
It's a pigsty here.

11
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:38,323
That arrogance is cute.

12
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,075
You are gone all the time.

13
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,953
In theory, you work because I'm away. Right?

14
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:46,665
We just met twice this week, and I'm your babysitter.

15
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:49,626
Don't lower yourself,
you're much more than that for me.

16
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:52,462
It's a dredge plan, isn't it?

17
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,506
I can go to court for harassment.

18
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:56,224
OK.

19
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:58,135
I'm a lawyer.

20
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,438
All I do is look after your
daughters in your absence.

21
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:01,638
Eliott,

22
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:05,142
We cannot limit ourselves to
confined roles for existence.

23
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,145
I gave you so much freedom.

24
00:02:08,353 --> 00:02:10,981
It's normal, you emancipate yourself.

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,733
What?
Well, yes,

26
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,818
you want to show you have character,

27
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:17,654
that you are someone free, self-employed.

28
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:20,357
I see that in you, don't be deceived.

29
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,784
I see you.
Your daughters are unhappy.

30
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,302
Get out.

31
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,538
I quit.
Here,

32
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,916
I propose something. You go to take a break,

33
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,793
and to come back in one hour.
No.

34
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,045
I'll increase your pay by 5%.

35
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:37,549
20%? Do you want to ruin me?

36
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,635
OK! You take the food out of
the mouths of my sweethearts.

37
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:41,219
No problem.

38
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:44,181
OK. Get out of here.

39
00:02:44,973 --> 00:02:46,099
OK, get out. That's fine.

40
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,277
You're saving me, Sophie. I owe you.

41
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,991
Girls, this is Sophie.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,160
She will be baby-sitting you. Behave yourselves.

43
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,913
I'm glad it's you, they adore you.

44
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:13,251
I prefer authority over obsequiousness.

45
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,342
Hey! Axel, congratulations!

46
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,194
My photo, my...Photo!

47
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:23,595
It's not done yet.

48
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,972
Let's not re-shoot that for the 500th time.
Yes. Yes.

49
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,432
Let's just get on with it. More enthusiasm.

50
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,601
I understand, more enthusiasm.

51
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:30,960
Yes.

52
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,979
Hey! Wow!

53
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,107
Axel!

54
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:36,692
Well, this is it!

55
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,362
What's going on, what?
A wedding and everything is...

56
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,322
Axel! You are...

57
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:45,409
one of the four pillars of my existence.

58
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:48,829
Even though I don't understand what it means.

59
00:03:49,037 --> 00:03:50,747
But it's just that...

60
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:54,334
We didn't always much know in friendship...pardon!

61
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:55,602
Make it simple.

62
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,004
Yeah, more concise, more...
Yes.

63
00:03:58,755 --> 00:03:59,923
Punchy, maybe.

64
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,593
Hey! Axel! Uh...

65
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,805
What a wonderful day, uh...

66
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:08,682
My photo, what?

67
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:13,145
Life isn't a local phenomenon.

68
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,021
It is a miracle of life.

69
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,773
The enabling conditions

70
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:21,027
that made life possible on Earth.
Yes.

71
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:25,615
If you take the Big Bang and
not a trick, a separate point,

72
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:30,287
if we take the planar satellite which
observes the astronomical radiation,

73
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,539
Yes.
...we are surrounded by the Big Bang.

74
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:36,251
We are surrounded, suddenly,
we get the feeling of being in a phew.

75
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,129
Extrapolating this idea that the universe is an egg,

76
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:41,673
we consider Him creating life.

77
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,301
We have a surprise alongside Vincent,

78
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:46,511
a little thing has been prepared for you.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,879
Vincent!

(SUSANNA BY ADRIANO CELENTANO)

81
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:08,723
* Seven days in Portofino *
* More than a month in Saint Tropez *

82
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:14,523
* Then you told me... *
* "Honey" *

83
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,459
Maybe we are on the shelf of a mad scientist

84
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,586
who reflects on the concept of life.
Mm.

85
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:23,298
We are at an advanced stage of
civilization which unites people.

86
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:24,457
Everybody!

87
00:05:24,547 --> 00:05:27,661
* Susanna, Susanna *

88
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,221
Come on, sing everyone!

89
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:33,081
* Susanna, Susanna my love*

90
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:44,001
* Me, a tourist from Ticino *
* I, the queen of Pigalle *

91
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:54,001
* I said to you "come away with me" *
* And a triangle of Rhinestones *

92
00:05:55,051 --> 00:06:03,051
* I told you, "I'll come back" *
* I told you "yes" *

93
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:14,182
* "But no! Mister, don't worry. Go!" *

94
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:21,923
* Susanna, Susanna...*

95
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:24,901
And even on the question of species barrier,

96
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,070
between ape and man for example,

97
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:31,241
it's very artificial, because the base is the same.

98
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:33,285
So this would not have been evolved

99
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:37,247
at the base, to make entities so diverse.

100
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:46,067
* Susanna, Susanna, Susanna, Susanna my love*

101
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:55,109
* ...and you shall return to Juorno *

102
00:06:57,809 --> 00:06:59,269
To you, Suzanna.

103
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,247
I spend my days with morons

104
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:22,918
who think of starting "The day today",

105
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:24,377
and will be acquitted.

106
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:27,213
You okay?

107
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:30,133
This girl is completely crazy,

108
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:33,637
We're going to separate. I saw her in bad shape.

109
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:35,597
Shit, but...

110
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,143
but you're going bad all the time.
No, no.

111
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,062
That was different.

112
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,361
Is that all you have to say?

113
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:50,912
Mr.Mallet?

114
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,405
Yeah!
Hey?

115
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,282
No, he's a guy I know.

116
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,025
What are you doing there?

117
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,068
Good evening.

118
00:07:57,202 --> 00:08:00,580
Good evening, I am a distant cousin of the witness.

119
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,542
Okay, let me introduce a friend,
he is a former client.

120
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,836
What were you accused of?
Stoups.

121
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,129
Narcotics.

122
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:13,969
And by the way, I wanted to thank you
for getting me out of the business.

123
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:17,263
You never had the head of a dealer, anyway.

124
00:08:17,472 --> 00:08:19,224
That's nice of you.
It's true.

125
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,435
Oh bah! He was listening, he's a bit...

126
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,396
it's not going very well.

127
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:28,984
In any case, you look very content.

128
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,486
It's a lot of work, you know.

129
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,867
Besides, I wanted to take advantage of it.

130
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:42,163
Actually, I'm looking for a job...
Yes.

131
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:45,000
I have nothing more to see in the middle, and all that.
Mm.

132
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,335
So if you hear about

133
00:08:47,544 --> 00:08:49,629
an internship somewhere or something,

134
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,256
it would help me.
Okay.

135
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:55,218
Personally, I'm looking for a trainee, but...

136
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,887
No.
I'm already having trouble, you see...to pay,

137
00:08:58,096 --> 00:09:00,557
so I haven't committed to anyone.

138
00:09:00,765 --> 00:09:01,766
If I hear...

139
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,269
I can work for free, for you.

140
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,104
Uh...yeah, well...

141
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:08,982
It seems strange to me, but...

142
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,110
But you never did it right!
No. No...

143
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,529
I have the motivation, however, it's already...

144
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:16,197
Yes that's good.

145
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,825
I am worried about my future.
Me as well.

146
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,493
Oh good.
What do you mean?

147
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,412
I meant...mine.

148
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,747
Oh OK.
Yes. Yes.

149
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:27,208
It will be fine.

00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:50,226
Did people see you go out?

165
00:11:50,435 --> 00:11:51,603
I don't know.

166
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:52,979
Oh, sure.

167
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:57,192
At the same time, when you want to
sleep with a woman,

168
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,152
you put yourself in a tight spot.

169
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,654
You're not in the midst of this world.

170
00:12:04,532 --> 00:12:06,075
You got Jamal.
He is bad.

171
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,828
No! He is a brilliant lawyer.

172
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,113
No, Victoria.

173
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:13,541
I swear, I'm ready for anything,
but a 'no' from you.

174
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,795
Well, I see that, but...
I'm not joking, seriously.

175
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,424
How can I prove she did it alone?

176
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:21,991
She's a tart...

177
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,219
She's a tart, she wants my skin,

178
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,221
she wants to destroy me.

179
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,351
Maybe you don't remember,

180
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,603
you took out a knife

181
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:35,855
to threaten her.
No, I didn't do that.

182
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:38,483
I didn't want to kill her, I'm innocent, okay?

183
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,153
She is obsessed with knives. She dreams of it.

184
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:44,656
She has plenty of knives,
she threatens me with it.

185
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,658
What's the point of accusing you?

186
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,326
She wants me to pay up.

187
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,745
Well, dammit, you know me!

188
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:52,705
I'm not capable of that.

189
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:54,707
I can't be your lawyer.

190
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,920
It's been five minutes and
you bring up our friendship.

191
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,506
Ethically, it's not right.

192
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:05,802
I was at the your wedding, I can be called to testify. No.

193
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,679
Get Jamal, he's the best.

194
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:10,098
He does not believe me.
Yes, that's good!

195
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,475
If we accept all clients speak the truth,

196
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,018
we would be unemployed.

197
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,603
But you believe me.

198
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,649
Doesn't matter! I can't defend you
because you are a friend.

199
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:23,152
I would never measure up to this case.

200
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:25,863
You've won big trials.
I lost them!

201
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,131
A lot of them.

202
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,910
The ones I won were not
when the customer was at stake.

203
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,328
This is different.

204
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,540
Usually I don't care whether
they are guilty or innocent.

205
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,750
Don't you want to defend an innocent man?

206
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,420
No, I prefer to defend a guilty person.

207
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:44,215
If you are innocent, what I would wish think is that
"you are my friend",

208
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,010
I would be afraid, I would not have the right to make mistakes.

209
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,345
I don't care about that! That's all in theory.

210
00:13:50,054 --> 00:13:52,056
I'm in deep shit and I need help.

211
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,975
It's your job, I'll pay you.

212
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:55,893
It's impossible.

213
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,602
You must be open to the world.

214
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,564
I already feel very open,
very explosive out in the world.

215
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:44,859
I'm talking about a world of sex.

216
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:50,615
It's not for lack of trying, but...

217
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:54,619
I don't feel very concerned by sex, right now.

218
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,662
I don't want to hear your story.

219
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:57,955
And stop the drugs.

220
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,457
I don't take drugs.

221
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,751
I don't want anything happening to you.

222
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,128
I prefer not to talk about my health.

223
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,255
I prefer to talk about love, money.

224
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:10,093
I say everything and not necessarily
what you come to hear.

225
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,056
I see someone spies on you.

226
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,017
But I can't seem to see

227
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,936
who, nor how.

228
00:15:20,395 --> 00:15:22,146
Someone is watching you.

229
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,733
Hello. What are you doing here?

230
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:27,568
I was on the way to school.

231
00:15:27,944 --> 00:15:30,279
No just kidding, I brought you your purse.

232
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:32,407
Thank you.
Girls!

233
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,910
I wanted to talk about something else...
Uh...

234
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:39,288
Come with me. Hold that for me, please. Thank you.

235
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:41,457
Hold on. Come, come.

236
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,002
Since my separation, I've lived with a friend.

237
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,464
And in fact, I've stopped dealing,

238
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:51,717
so that I may pay more for the apartment
and I resume my studies.

239
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,470
But my dream is to be a lawyer.
Okay.

240
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,516
But in between drugs, bakery and avocado, it's a bit...

241
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,101
Yes...no, no...

242
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,437
I would like to take up law studies,

243
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,314
and help you on the side...
Excuse me. Hello?

244
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,141
In the next call,

245
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,570
I'll let go of your cousin,
he'll have trouble finding a lawyer,

246
00:16:10,778 --> 00:16:12,029
24 hours before the hearing. OK?

247
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,243
What do you want?
Be your apprentice,

248
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,662
and eventually your personal assistant.

249
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:22,457
I'm looking for a babysitter.

250
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:26,210
Yes, that would includes this as well.
I could be your "Au pair".

251
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,588
And you have room for this?
No, it's true.

252
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:30,923
Among other things, it's not just that.

253
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:35,051
And I don't judge your way of life,
you can leave dragging your panties.

254
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:36,554
I could re-arrange with pleasure.

255
00:16:37,972 --> 00:16:40,057
Well, no, not in that sense!

256
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,477
I misspoke.
Mm. Yes.

257
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:44,228
I could be...

258
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,730
your man from the shadows.

259
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:49,525
I could solve your problems and then, if you like,

260
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:50,860
become your assistant.

261
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:56,866
We could try out for a week.

262
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,284
Yes.
Okay?

263
00:16:58,493 --> 00:17:00,786
If it doesn't work out, we could stop there. OK?

264
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,247
Yeah.
Good. Okay.

265
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:05,708
Okay. Great.
One week.

266
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,712
Yeah, I can...
Where do I sleep?

267
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:12,089
Well, here. In fact, this is your bed.

268
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,218
There are only two rooms.
Oh OK! This is fine.

269
00:17:15,927 --> 00:17:18,679
On a side note, no drugs here.

270
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,349
Oh yes, I'm in the clean phase of my life.

271
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,851
No worries there.
OK perfect.

272
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:28,439
Well, I'm going to wash myself.
I'm going to get ready.

273
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:30,107
Are you going out tonight?

274
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,444
No, I have an appointment with a guy from work.

275
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:36,447
Okay. Well, I didn't think so.
Could I cook?

276
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,909
Great! Grab that card from my purse for groceries.

277
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:41,661
Yeah OK!
Cool!

278
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:44,705
What's the code?
3668,

279
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,042
Girls, this is Sam who will take care of you.

280
00:18:06,978 --> 00:18:08,104
It's beautiful!

281
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:12,483
It's very beautiful!

282
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,448
Don't you want to lie down?

283
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,469
Is it okay?
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:43,681
Finally, Doc. I'm asking a lot of
questions about my life.

285
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,474
You're smiling. Is this a joke?

286
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,926
No.

287
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:48,394
No, I meant...

288
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,105
I'm talking about what you would like to discuss.

289
00:18:51,397 --> 00:18:54,734
Bah! We could discuss that two seconds later, right?

290
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,945
Yes.
You see, I...

291
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,032
I have a friend who asked me for help.

292
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:06,078
And if I did help, puts me in a complicated situation.

293
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:07,663
But I have to reassure him.

294
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:11,000
I introduce people who I consider professionally,

295
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,002
and I hope it does.

296
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:14,411
But...

297
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,382
In the hindsight, I feel guilty
not being able to help him.

298
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:21,510
I'm wondering,

299
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,846
I don't know how to go about it.

300
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:25,181
You see?
Yeah.

301
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,147
It bothers me to let him down.

302
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,399
I understand.

303
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,820
It's complicated, he's a friend.

304
00:19:40,029 --> 00:19:43,908
Finally we got together. He counts on me.

305
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:49,872
I can't read your mind, there.
Oh yeah.

306
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:51,123
Oh no.

307
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:56,212
OK, I'll be quiet. Let's start again.
OK.

308
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,513
But as his lawyer if I defend badly...

309
00:20:07,431 --> 00:20:09,850
If he loses, I will not recover.

310
00:20:10,768 --> 00:20:15,106
It will torture me. I'll have to ask myself
if I could have done better.

311
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,524
Well, come on, that's enough.

312
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:18,609
This isn't serious.
No.

313
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,902
Come on, it's okay.

314
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:22,905
This could evolve positively.

315
00:20:23,114 --> 00:20:25,282
In any case, don't worry, I won't judge.

316
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:26,867
I was more in it, there.

317
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:30,121
Was it okay?

318
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:35,626
If you want to talk, I'm here.

319
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:45,636
You know, Sam,

320
00:20:45,886 --> 00:20:48,472
I have imperfections which hides enormous qualities.

321
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:50,891
I don't doubt it.

322
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:57,565
Our proximity is a handicap,
this case must be made strong.

323
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:00,234
If I accept, I need to understand why

324
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,696
Eve decided to stab herself, to accuse you.

325
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,197
I need to know everything.

326
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,782
How was it, sexually?

327
00:21:06,991 --> 00:21:09,243
She wants me to pay for her ex.

328
00:21:09,452 --> 00:21:11,996
Did she sleep with a lot of guys?
Yes.

329
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:16,459
We were two molecules that attracted but
one was full of gangrenous atoms.

330
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,878
Not too many metaphors with the judge.

331
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:21,255
I'm paying all this for her ex-psychopaths,

332
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,340
and she doesn't give in to sex.

333
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:27,094
I didn't force her to live with me, I didn't tie her up.

334
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:29,388
I'm successful with women

335
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,640
and not wanting to stab one.

336
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:34,852
Stick to the question, Mr.Kossarski.

337
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,147
Yes. I never struck, offered resistance,

338
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:39,431
and vice versa.

339
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,735
No! She says you snatched her panties violently.

340
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,779
No! I may have done it,

341
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:47,323
but in an act of sexual riches and fantasy.

342
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,408
In a playful way, not violence.

343
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:53,412
But no. Even if I wanted, that's impossible.
She did not wear it.

344
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:55,790
Let's come back to the seriousness of facts.

345
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:58,000
We don't solve a couple's disputes.

346
00:21:58,209 --> 00:21:59,335
Of course.
Good.

347
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,129
During the act, did you see

348
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:05,341
anyone or a witness watch you?
No.

349
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:08,427
No human witness, but Jacques, her dog.

350
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:10,262
He was there and it bothered me.

351
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:11,889
Miss Scorr's dog?
Yes.

352
00:22:13,224 --> 00:22:15,601
And you saw him during the act?

353
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:21,649
No, he was looking at me. And it disrupted me.

354
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:29,698
Are we putting him in jail?
Yes, we put him in jail.

355
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:31,826
Hello!
Hello.

356
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,619
What are you doing here?

357
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,746
I can see my daughters, right?

358
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:38,999
Are you okay?

359
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:42,378
I'm part of a writers blog.

360
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:45,381
You have a central place in my story.

361
00:22:45,923 --> 00:22:47,383
You inspired me a lot.

362
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,263
Girls, stop playing, we're going to eat.

363
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,306
David, say goodbye to the girls.

364
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:56,725
OK, OK.

365
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,854
Don't underestimate my authority.

366
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,398
Don't underestimate my indifference.

367
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:05,526
I'm worried, I was a no-go with the judge.

368
00:23:05,734 --> 00:23:09,154
I thought she was going to throw out the complaint.
I'm anxious...

369
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:11,824
Vincent! Calm down, I'll get you out of there.

370
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:14,577
I have not done anything, believe me. Talk to her.

371
00:23:14,785 --> 00:23:16,078
The Convaincs,

372
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,873
it's unjust, irrational.

373
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,250
I can't talk to her.
Please.

374
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,668
No!
This trial...

375
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:24,670
I don't have the right to do that.

376
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:26,630
Do you understand?
I'm on my knees.

377
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,883
Really, calm down. Get some rest.

378
00:23:29,091 --> 00:23:30,259
Rest?
Ciao.

379
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,184
The judge advised me not to take this case.

380
00:23:39,393 --> 00:23:40,895
Why do you have that phone?

381
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:42,730
It's unbreakable.

382
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:44,982
It's designed for the military.

383
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,236
Oh damn, that guy!

384
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:53,073
Good evening.
Good evening.

385
00:23:53,741 --> 00:23:55,701
I'm IntelloBG75,

386
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,995
Oh no, I don't think so.
Yes, yes.

387
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,623
Oh? I didn't recognize you. Ah yes.

388
00:24:01,665 --> 00:24:03,250
Good evening.
Good evening.

389
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:06,170
Over there.

390
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,096
Oh no, that's not what I thought I would do.

391
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:17,806
Sorry. No it's me.

392
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:21,101
I don't want to. I prefer to get to know one other.

393
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,604
Why did you bring me to your room, then?

394
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:26,690
This is the only room where we can talk quietly.

395
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,654
Can I sit on the bed?
Yes.

396
00:24:32,112 --> 00:24:33,280
Yes of course.

397
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:38,827
We mustn't feel compelled, if we don't feel

398
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,288
any attraction for each other.

399
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:43,415
For you and for me.

400
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,059
We're still...

401
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,920
I find you very desirable.

402
00:24:50,673 --> 00:24:52,091
Did you want to drink something?

403
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,009
Do you have whiskey?
Yes.

404
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:55,970
I love whiskey with sugar.

405
00:24:56,178 --> 00:24:58,555
Me too! I like it the same way.
Is that true?

406
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,808
No, that was to find something common.

407
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,560
I don't know what's going on, it's difficult.

408
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:48,105
I don't see the emergency exit.

409
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:49,732
Yeah.

410
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,316
Well, it's not far off.

411
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,293
What?

412
00:25:53,402 --> 00:25:54,436
The exit.

413
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:57,281
We all look for it,

414
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,824
somewhere, right?

415
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,003
I wanted to drown myself in sex.

416
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:16,717
Yes.

417
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,927
That happen to you?

418
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,473
Perhaps, you need a vacation?

419
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,560
Shall I accompany you?

420
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:32,357
Good and bad news.

421
00:26:32,566 --> 00:26:34,276
The maid?
Look.

422
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,030
I created an account and
asked the guests to be friends.

423
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:40,824
And they accepted?
Look at my picture.

424
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:42,993
They don't know who I am. You get the idea!

425
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,661
That's good. It's awesome.

426
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:49,083
And the bad news?
You know your ex's blog?

427
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:51,627
No why?
He wrote about you.

428
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,047
Oh yes, no, I know. But I'm not interested.

429
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:56,340
Look at it anyway.

430
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,718
Your name is Vicky Spock, you defend psychopaths.

431
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:01,053
You are unstable.

432
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:03,680
He's talking about cases you've pleaded.

433
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,727
He has a reading tomorrow with the
"Crazy Blogger Club".

434
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:11,688
They meet up every Wednesday morning in a bar.

435
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,358
They talk about literature in general.

436
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,902
If not, their books, scenarios...

437
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:20,572
She didn't care what would
happen to this low level dealer.

438
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:23,450
The important thing was, to feel the €3,000,

439
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:27,037
the guy was paying in €10 bills,
to this shameless lawyer.

440
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:31,333
Vicky S. splurged drug money.

441
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:35,379
In addition, she slept with senior judicial officials.

442
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,714
She had a relationship with a famous judge

443
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:40,342
and contacted the press, nourishing hope

444
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,719
to entrust important business.

445
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:44,721
She represents the incompatibility

446
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,975
between a feminist stature to a humanist.

447
00:27:48,183 --> 00:27:51,194
And her fascination for money and power.

448
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,981
I watched as a hummingbird caught in the storm.

449
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,983
I was only a pawn, invisible,

450
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:58,360
but I could see everything in secret.

451
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,354
Thank you very much, David.

452
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:02,406
It's great, there's everything...

453
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:06,076
the intimate life that mixes with professional life,

454
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,328
the bumpy side of legal affairs.

455
00:28:08,537 --> 00:28:13,792
Makes great material to feed the blog.

456
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:15,919
Don't hesitate to be interactive,

457
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:18,964
this must be on the trans-media.

458
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:20,632
Today,

459
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:23,010
so, offer your ideas, what not.

460
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:26,180
Go ahead, nurture the workshop with these ideas.

461
00:28:26,388 --> 00:28:29,725
Yes. Flood the blogs and social networks.

462
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,019
Facebook, Twitter.

463
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,563
How could you write these rumors about me?

464
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:37,774
This is dangerous for me, for our children.

465
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,027
Is it because I didn't give you any money?

466
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:43,197
I regained the trust that I had lost.

467
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:46,116
I have a recognized talent, it's my job.

468
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,118
I'm sorry you didn't notice.

469
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,997
I am inspired by my experience.
I always wanted to do that.

470
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,625
You were in my life. This is auto-fiction.

471
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,710
You barely masked the names!

472
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:00,380
You mess about with my reputation without
even thinking about the consequence.

473
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,966
You reveal things that I confided in you.

474
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:04,927
Do you realize the gravity of the situation?

475
00:29:05,135 --> 00:29:07,262
You put out confidential details.

476
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:10,599
It's just a bloody blog!
Just a bloody blog?

477
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:13,227
Stop holding back information.

478
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:15,896
You embalm a reality, I lived with.

479
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:19,441
Now this reality belongs to me and I want to share it.

480
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:33,789
Hi Suzanna, I can't talk to you.

481
00:29:33,997 --> 00:29:35,031
Just 30 seconds.

482
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,417
I can't talk to you, you are a witness.

483
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:40,295
You are aware that you defend a monster?

484
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:44,341
This asshole broke-up my marriage.
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,843
I have pictures when it was happened.

486
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,554
I spent 10 months for this day.

487
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:52,641
My parents took out a loan for €20,000,

488
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:54,476
I understand that.

489
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:58,272
The investment of it, of course. And the work that went in.

490
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,190
But I have nothing to do with that.

491
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,025
The guy is a psychopath.

492
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:06,196
Listen, we'll talk about it, in a year's time. Sorry.

493
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:07,531
In a year?

494
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,283
This chapter is over,

495
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:12,327
Vincent risks great pain, he deserves a defense.

496
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:15,622
The guy is a misogynist. I would, would you?

497
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,040
No, this has nothing to do with it.

498
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,082
What has misogynist got to do,
with women as victims by nature.

499
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,072
I'm sorry! I've to go.

500
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:26,508
Hello.

501
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,053
How's it going, girls?

502
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:32,973
Did you have a good day?
Yeah.

503
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:40,063
Did you know the judge arranged for

504
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,649
an expert on Eve's dog?
Oh yeah?

505
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,110
Ouch.
Careful.

506
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,070
David showed me his script.

507
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,296
What?

508
00:30:49,323 --> 00:30:52,576
He's a neurotic blogger riding my back.

509
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,994
I'm going to sue him.

510
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,347
Is it true your slept 497 times with a judge?

511
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,115
No, of course not.

512
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:03,545
When I hear we had sexual intercourse, it's all fiction.

513
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:08,133
Girls, enough of the iPad, now.
Oh yes, no more.

514
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:11,219
Girls, stop the iPad.

515
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:13,388
No, it's not good for you.

516
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:17,059
Come on, listen to me a little. Come on.

517
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:19,353
Stop the iPad, give it to me.

518
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:23,273
Come on! Well, listen to me, here!

519
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,109
Come on, give me that.

520
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:27,694
No.

521
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,823
Let go, it's mine.

522
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,677
The dog expert says, the smell is stressing him.

523
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:55,180
This dog is jealous.
Eve keeps him for protection,

524
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,932
He never corroborated my version.

525
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,643
Sexual?
No, not even a touch.

526
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:03,438
Maybe you scared him by striking her.

527
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:06,024
No and of what value would that be, scientifically?

528
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:08,944
Doesn't prove anything, she doesn't love me.

529
00:32:09,152 --> 00:32:11,780
Who would seriously take the testimony of a pet?

530
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:18,078
Hello.
Hello, this is it.

531
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:20,705
I acknowledge the theft,

532
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:23,208
there was a lot of money. But not aggression,

533
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:27,129
It's not true, I did nothing. Security had a vengeance.

534
00:32:27,337 --> 00:32:30,090
He wanted to humiliate me in front of all customers.

535
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:31,925
He hit me with a belt.

536
00:32:32,134 --> 00:32:34,469
He inflicted a cut, but the blow is gone.

537
00:32:34,678 --> 00:32:36,888
David comes from a bourgeois family, supposedly.

538
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,099
He does not give a damn about money.

539
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,810
He has time for purists.

540
00:32:42,018 --> 00:32:44,729
For purists?
Yes, it's a luxury anyway.

541
00:32:44,938 --> 00:32:48,024
To be able to play the moralists, it's naive.

542
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,361
I made-up bull, I had no choice.

543
00:32:51,695 --> 00:32:53,780
So why does he reveal it all?

544
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,202
He suffers from a lack of of personality. He's a slacker.

545
00:33:00,162 --> 00:33:04,040
He is obsessed with the idea that
information must flow.

546
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,544
He loves the idea of ​​transparency.

547
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,755
He sees himself in righteousness. And I, in evil.

548
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,300
Did you sleep with magistrates?

549
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,509
Yes, much earlier though,

550
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:17,304
I was a little obsessed with sex.

551
00:33:18,889 --> 00:33:21,558
I liked this almost regressive state

552
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:23,685
and self-sterilizing.

553
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,862
Would it bother you?

554
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,355
No.

555
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,158
Excuse me, I'm a little stressed,

556
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:40,702
I myself have troubles...
As for the blow I am...

557
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,287
Do you mind if you talk about it?

558
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:44,130
No, no...

559
00:33:44,139 --> 00:33:46,508
I'm in a situation...that's troublesome.

560
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,337
I confided in someone,

561
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,897
and now he wants to use it against me.

562
00:33:53,673 --> 00:33:55,133
I wonder...

563
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:59,095
do I attack it, out maneuver or crush him?

564
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,348
Don't cave in, defend yourself.

565
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,016
So do I attack him? Is that it?

566
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:04,643
Obviously, that's your job.

567
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:07,479
Yes, yes, I know how to do that. Yes.

568
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,568
Is everything alright?

569
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:16,613
All good. It's you who is the accused.

570
00:34:17,072 --> 00:34:18,156
Excuse me,

571
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:20,200
I just wanted an external point of view.

572
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:31,753
I love sex.

573
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:36,091
I feel how you feel, thousand times over.

574
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:39,010
How do you know how I feel?

575
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,428
I know that's all.

576
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,765
I feel everything exponentially.

577
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:46,476
Have you been sensitive for a long time?

578
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:47,894
Always.

579
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:50,397
I learned to live with it.

580
00:34:51,106 --> 00:34:53,733
I love myself more than most people love each other.

581
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:55,569
I work on it every day.

582
00:34:57,654 --> 00:35:00,657
I love myself to give more pleasure to the other.

583
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,454
I have a body, I respect it.

584
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,165
I don't pretend, I don't cheat.

585
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,711
I embrace the one who spends a few hours with me.

586
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:19,759
Sex isn't a priority, at the moment.

587
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:27,601
I wonder why wallow in with such pleasure,
without asking questions.

588
00:35:28,602 --> 00:35:30,395
Sex, sex, sex. I'm into a short cut.

589
00:35:31,605 --> 00:35:33,273
It's like coming back to...

590
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:37,110
the state of an infant.

591
00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:38,378
Do you understand?

592
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:41,990
Stop asking me this, otherwise
you will continue on that couch.

593
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:44,075
Suddenly...

594
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,077
I was panic-stricken.

595
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:49,789
Everything I've experienced in the week has re-emerged.

596
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:52,709
And his body seemed heavy on me.

597
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,714
So heavy that I had to get rid of him.

598
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,966
As if I had committed a crime and...

599
00:36:00,175 --> 00:36:02,719
I had to get rid of him, at once.

600
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:04,721
I pretended to do something,

601
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,599
I went out, he stayed in the room.

602
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,809
And then I panicked.

603
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,701
Sam.

604
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,946
What's the matter?

605
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:24,616
What's going on?

606
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:26,117
What's the matter?

607
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:29,287
What's happening?

608
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:33,166
Calm down, everything is fine, breathes calmly. Breathe.

609
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,425
OK?

610
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:36,044
I'm going to ask you a few questions.

611
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:37,629
Where are you? Where are you?

612
00:36:37,837 --> 00:36:39,172
You hear me?

613
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:40,799
Have you ever had these attacks?

614
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,193
Did he rape you?

615
00:36:43,843 --> 00:36:45,220
A dangerous position?

616
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:48,682
It's good, I know that, think of something pleasant.

617
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,768
Think of little dwarfs, small rabbits to the sea.

618
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:52,977
Lexo...
Everything is fine.

619
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:54,771
Shut up.
You want Lexomil?

620
00:36:54,979 --> 00:36:56,147
Yes. Where are they?

621
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:00,735
On the book shelf.

622
00:37:00,944 --> 00:37:02,445
In the book shelf? OK.

623
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,116
I got them.

624
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:08,493
All right, open your mouth.

625
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:12,038
Here. Here, swallow it.

626
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:16,042
Here, lie down to circulate blood.

627
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,370
Breathe calmly.

628
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,049
Here, breath.

629
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,759
Breathe.

630
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,139
OK. Do you feel better?
Yes.

631
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,598
Thank you.

632
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:32,892
Were you a nurse?

633
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:36,855
No, I helped guys who felt sick after crack.

634
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,942
I need a vanishing point.
Look at the sky.

635
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:42,226
Okay?

636
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,088
I need space.

637
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,281
You got some space.

638
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:47,749
Everything is fine.

639
00:37:47,757 --> 00:37:49,284
I need to see in front of me.

640
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:51,453
Everything is fine.
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

641
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:53,538
Oh no, it's okay, she's better now.

642
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:54,814
Sorry.

643
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:56,124
Well, I'm leaving.

644
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:57,917
I'm not sure to go three-way.

645
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:59,961
That's not what you think.

646
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,838
I look after the children.
Children?

647
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:03,840
Well, it was nice seeing you.

648
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,592
I'm leaving.
No stay.

649
00:38:07,343 --> 00:38:08,511
Hey guy!

650
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,139
Is he stupid, or what?

651
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:12,724
It's not serious or anything.

652
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:15,310
Deep breaths.

653
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:18,897
I'm going to bed.

654
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,026
Could you come with me, please?
What?

655
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:24,819
Just two seconds.
Yeah.

656
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:27,071
In my room.
Yeah, okay.

657
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:28,948
Come.

658
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:34,287
Let's go slow.

659
00:38:35,975 --> 00:38:39,287
(WITHOUT HER BY HARRY NILSSON)

660
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:47,687
* I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there *
* But she never comes *

661
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:52,957
* And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes *
* And I rise to face another day without her *

662
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:59,987
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

663
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:04,987
* It's just no good anymore *
* When you walk through the door of an empty room *

664
00:39:05,087 --> 00:39:13,687
* And then you go inside and set a table for one *
* It's no fun when you spend a day without her *

665
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:16,887
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

666
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:21,687
* We burst the pretty balloon *
* Took us to the moon *

667
00:39:21,787 --> 00:39:24,987
* Such a beautiful thing *
* But it's ended now *

668
00:39:25,087 --> 00:39:31,027
* And it sounds like a lie *
* If I say I'd rather die than live without her *

669
00:39:31,117 --> 00:39:35,017
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *
* Without her, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

670
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:38,217
Miss Spick, I regret to inform you that you are being
summoned by the 'The Order of Lawyers' for contacting

671
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,217
one of the witnesses in the Scorr-Kossarski case.

672
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:42,217
Article 183 of Decree No 91-1197 dated 27 November 1991,
Organization Of Advocate Profession states that:

673
00:39:42,317 --> 00:39:43,974
Any contravention of laws and regulations,
any violation of the professional rules, any ...

674
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:47,777
In 12 years of practice,

675
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:50,321
Victoria Spick has never committed a mistake.

676
00:39:50,738 --> 00:39:52,073
I call into question

677
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:54,993
the accusation of this woman who sued her.

678
00:39:55,368 --> 00:39:58,288
I would say "pursued to her home",

679
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,622
and even harassed her.

680
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,209
My colleague did not go voluntarily to meet her.

681
00:40:03,418 --> 00:40:06,462
She even explained that she could
possibly influence the case.

682
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,717
Should she be remanded for addressing that woman,

683
00:40:10,925 --> 00:40:13,636
to say that she can't even talk to her?

684
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:14,879
I don't believe that,

685
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:15,897
Your Honor.

686
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:18,057
Blocking her from this case would have consequences

687
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:19,267
for my colleague.

688
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:23,146
May I state, she has two dependent
children she raises by herself.

689
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,023
The father of the children...

690
00:40:25,231 --> 00:40:29,903
a fantastic artist, has not paid her in 7 months.

691
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,863
My dear colleagues,

692
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:34,115
do not impose a suspension

693
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:38,703
that would aggravate her situation
more than it is already.

694
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,542
Please.

695
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:51,132
We have decided to suspend you for 6 months.

696
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:54,093
Till then, you are not to practice.

697
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:56,846
You knew it yourself, colleague.

698
00:40:57,263 --> 00:41:01,017
It is forbidden to discuss the case with a witness.

699
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,895
You accepted to defend someone you knew,

700
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:07,982
you should have been more vigilant.

701
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:11,110
I'm aware this will be hard on you.

702
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:14,864
But I never familiarized my clients or witnesses.

703
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:18,117
One must be very careful!
I don't eat with my client,

704
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,745
when on trial in the province.

705
00:41:20,954 --> 00:41:23,957
But I don't dine with a client, or drink.

706
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:27,001
No one has my number, they go through cabinets,

707
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,920
by the Secretary, there is a filter.

708
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,589
If you leave them no power, it's good.

709
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:35,551
If they understand,
you can stop defending them at any time,

710
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,222
the guy will respect you.
We must remain in control of the situation.

711
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:54,612
You okay?

712
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:04,163
You look completely groggy. Is that a side effect?

713
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:06,290
No, the desired effect.

714
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,168
Why don't you stop taking that medication?

715
00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:11,212
I need to go down.

716
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,007
I'm here to help.

717
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:19,262
Sam, you are really great,
thank you very much for everything you done.

718
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:21,055
But I will have more

719
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:23,224
to talk to you, with what is happening to me.

720
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:27,645
No, no, but I...

721
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:29,856
I'd rather you go.

722
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:33,693
Take away from this and you should rebound.

723
00:42:33,901 --> 00:42:35,778
I can still help you on the case.

724
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:37,363
No, you can't.

725
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:39,407
Jamal took over the case.

726
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,870
I have no control on anything there.

727
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:49,459
But it's good.

728
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:51,269
You're very nice.

729
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:52,462
I'm not nice.

730
00:42:57,717 --> 00:42:58,843
Victoria, this is Vincent.

731
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:00,845
I don't know if you spoke to Jamal,

732
00:43:01,137 --> 00:43:04,348
in any case, this should be between Eve and me.

733
00:43:04,557 --> 00:43:06,392
He will surely withdraw the complaint.

734
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:10,563
Thank you for what you did.Thank you very much.

735
00:43:11,898 --> 00:43:16,861
Victoria, this is Jamal.
I convinced Eve not to withdraw her complaint,

736
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,281
I explained to her, what she risked doing that.

737
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,117
We'll play it soft so that it ends in dismissal.

738
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:25,745
Apart from that, they got back together.

739
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:27,246
Kisses, later.

740
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,835
You did a crappy job, Victoria.

741
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:38,549
You could have gotten into business law,
social law, public law, Real estate law...

742
00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:40,301
Yes, yes, I know my options...

743
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:42,512
You could have been much more fulfilled.

744
00:43:43,846 --> 00:43:46,599
To blossom, that's a trick for a relative treat.

745
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:51,312
You never made a professional mistake and
then you go talking to a witness.

746
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:53,606
That's the most you did.

747
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:55,608
I didn't know it would end bad.

748
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:57,944
Sorry, can we talk about this later?

749
00:43:58,486 --> 00:44:00,863
You see, you're passive aggressive.

750
00:44:02,198 --> 00:44:04,283
Your actions speak for themselves.

751
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:06,369
You're a fake person.

752
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:10,581
If you had assumed your aggressive side,
you would have lived better.

753
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,460
And you would not have been the victim of the impact,
rather you would have dominated it.

754
00:44:16,546 --> 00:44:18,297
I feel I'm not a victim of the impact.

755
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:21,717
I feel flexible. I bounced on impact.

756
00:44:22,677 --> 00:44:26,514
Sorry, but I prefer to be an ally than your friend.

757
00:44:29,016 --> 00:44:32,145
I love you very much, Victoria, hence my frankness.

758
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:37,984
What do you see?

759
00:44:38,985 --> 00:44:40,035
It's the same.

760
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,029
Not much.
What do you mean?

761
00:44:42,655 --> 00:44:45,241
It's always the same thing, we go around

762
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,243
with the drug history, with you.

763
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:50,371
What do you mean, drug history with me?

764
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,206
Why do you still see that?

765
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:53,958
There's always drugs.

766
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:57,128
I don't do drugs. There must be some interference.

767
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,688
No, no.

768
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,507
You may see me with an ex-dealer at my house.

769
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:04,510
This isn't at all what you believe, I fired him.

770
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,181
I see...

771
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:10,349
a professional breakdown.

772
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:11,817
What!?

773
00:45:11,826 --> 00:45:13,936
I don't pay you to tell me what I already know.

774
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:16,230
Tell me about the future, not the past.

775
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:19,108
Normally, I am impressed by your visions,

776
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,351
but this...

777
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:23,112
I'm not a shrink! I say what I see.

778
00:45:24,447 --> 00:45:26,949
I see drugs, I see some malice.

779
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,869
So, is there anything good in those cards?

780
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:32,455
Nothing at all, not even a thin one?

781
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,040
Always the same thing?

782
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,844
Your needles have a great effect on me.

783
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,889
These aren't needles.

784
00:45:50,097 --> 00:45:51,682
You are thinking nonsense.

785
00:45:52,475 --> 00:45:55,394
Do you talk fantasies with your colleagues?

786
00:45:56,145 --> 00:45:57,263
No.

787
00:45:57,897 --> 00:46:00,107
How's the sex going?

788
00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:06,072
I mainly enjoy in my work.

789
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:13,746
Pleasure, has nothing to do with enjoyment.

790
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:15,164
Do we agree?

791
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:26,092
I did not grasp the nuance...
Finally, I did not understand.

792
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:29,929
The pleasure you take to your work

793
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:33,015
has nothing to do with enjoyment.

794
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,976
Do you agree?
Mm

795
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:38,437
Good.
Probably, yes.

796
00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:40,398
Great.

797
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,067
We've started to close the vacuum.

798
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,489
Where are you? With your friend, Vincent?

799
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:55,746
We got together, I don't understand.

800
00:46:56,372 --> 00:46:58,040
Whether he did it or not, for that matter,

801
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,167
was completely masochist.

802
00:47:01,043 --> 00:47:03,671
Looks like I've bet on all the bad horses.

803
00:47:04,297 --> 00:47:06,757
Or that the eggs are all in the same basket,

804
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:08,718
And I am afar from the basket.

805
00:47:17,685 --> 00:47:18,978
I love you.

806
00:50:08,844 --> 00:50:10,444
Six months later...

807
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:14,778
Hello?
Hi Victoria, this is David.

808
00:50:14,987 --> 00:50:17,031
I have a great announcement to make,

809
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:19,408
I got the "Tumblr Award for Talent 2016"

810
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:22,369
for Vicky Spock, I have an important proposal.

811
00:50:22,603 -​​-> 00:50:24,897
I'm restless. Falling apart.

812
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,541
If you'd like to get back together, feel free.

813
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:29,793
I feel strongly at the moment.

814
00:50:30,002 --> 00:50:33,547
Otherwise I hope you are fine with the girls. Kisses, ciao.

815
00:50:42,097 --> 00:50:44,725
You've reached the answering machine of Samuel and Mal.

816
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:46,685
Sam, it's Victoria.

817
00:50:47,561 --> 00:50:49,104
I'm not very good...

818
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,856
I need to see you.

819
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,316
Excuse me?

820
00:51:13,254 --> 00:51:14,547
It's good to see you.

821
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,939
Me too.

822
00:51:20,302 --> 00:51:21,595
Did you change something?

823
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:23,597
Well no.

824
00:51:23,806 --> 00:51:24,807
Change what?

825
00:51:25,307 --> 00:51:26,308
I don't know.

826
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:30,729
You look good, you look good.

827
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:33,232
Oh good! Thanks, that's nice.

828
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:35,985
So, what do you do?

829
00:51:37,278 --> 00:51:40,739
I got into law books and took courses.

830
00:51:42,074 --> 00:51:43,117
This a joke?

831
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:44,868
Not at all.

832
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:48,289
You told me to bounce back. I did.

833
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:52,618
And you?

834
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:54,878
Me, uh...

835
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,214
Every hour weighs a ton.

836
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:02,094
I've the impression you hit rock bottom.

837
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,546
Yeah.

838
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:07,850
And know that in the abyss, there is nothing.

839
00:52:10,811 --> 00:52:12,104
You missed the girls.

840
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:14,315
I also missed them.

841
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:22,197
You could come back here, some time,

842
00:52:22,406 --> 00:52:24,450
past, I head out of the water.

843
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:27,369
OK, let me help you in your job.

844
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,456
When does you suspension end?

845
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:32,499
It's been over 10 days.

846
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:37,838
I need work. I can't live like this.

847
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,550
I need to reconnect with community.

848
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:35,789
You are beautiful.

849
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,553
Victoria, this is Vincent.
Wanted to remind you,

850
00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:53,932
One of my ex, Leslie Chevalier,
accuses me of harassment.

851
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,811
I don't know how she knew about the case.

852
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:01,356
She pit Eve against me,
as a result, she is railed.

853
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,942
I know you're mad at me, but call me.

854
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:09,239
This is Jamal,

855
00:55:09,448 --> 00:55:11,325
speaks to Vincent, he fights the doorman,

856
00:55:11,533 --> 00:55:14,286
comes in a bathrobe to my office, he is unmanageable.

857
00:55:15,788 --> 00:55:18,332
I need to know the whole case,

858
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,250
why did you send these messages?

859
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:23,086
Leslie treats me like a psychopath without reason.

860
00:55:23,295 --> 00:55:26,590
She was ultra-violent, so I clarified things.

861
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,177
Clarified things?
It's a thin gap between clarification and harassment.

862
00:55:30,385 --> 00:55:32,262
Why did you not tell me?

863
00:55:32,554 --> 00:55:35,224
Might have helped you a little yourself!

864
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,976
Oh, don't take me on a ride with your moral codes.

865
00:55:38,185 --> 00:55:41,313
This is exactly why I need to be defended, not judged.

866
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:43,106
I left 6 months of hell.

867
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:44,900
I am the victim,

868
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,778
it was me who got tossed in a cell for 15 days,

869
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:50,572
while who filed a complaint against me,

870
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:51,907
loved me 10 days earlier.

871
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,166
Calm down.

872
00:55:53,492 --> 00:55:55,202
You're the only one who can help you.

873
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,412
You will hurt yourself if you're worried.

874
00:55:58,247 --> 00:55:59,665
Vincent must assert himself

875
00:55:59,873 --> 00:56:01,041
as...

876
00:56:02,376 --> 00:56:03,493
a victim.

877
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:06,171
Thanks Sam, that was very enlightening.

878
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,258
I don't think of your relationship with women,

879
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,426
I need to understand things.

880
00:56:11,718 --> 00:56:13,846
And you harass me so I may defend you?

881
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:16,849
Don't talk to me about that,
I'm dangling on a camisole.

882
00:56:17,224 --> 00:56:20,143
Why did you get back with Eve?
It's complicated.

883
00:56:20,352 --> 00:56:22,688
The bullshit, for sure.
Sex, mainly.

884
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:25,566
I thought it might work, but she wants to be God,

885
00:56:25,774 --> 00:56:26,808
from what I understand.

886
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:29,695
Jamal is right, you're both crazy.

887
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:31,572
I don't follow you anymore.

888
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,365
Don't judge me, I beg you.

889
00:56:33,574 --> 00:56:34,649
Vincent,

890
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,869
Victoria touched the limits of her profession.

891
00:56:37,077 --> 00:56:39,538
She must learn to separate work and emotions.

892
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:46,511
Promise me,

893
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,854
that you will resume your practice.

894
00:56:49,464 --> 00:56:51,133
You know what that means?

895
00:56:51,758 --> 00:56:53,051
That's 15 days!

896
00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:16,700
Looks like you're doing a puzzle.

897
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,410
Let me do it.

898
00:57:18,952 --> 00:57:20,370
Don't underestimate my commitment.

899
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:23,290
I didn't underestimate it, I was just wondering.

900
00:57:31,256 --> 00:57:32,591
Listen, Sam. I...

901
00:57:33,008 --> 00:57:35,302
I think in my head? That...

902
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:37,846
When I think about what we did the other night,

903
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:40,682
it was very good. Absolutely.

904
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:43,685
But, I think it's not good for us to...

905
00:57:44,186 --> 00:57:46,813
'mix' everything together, in our lives,

906
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:49,149
business and everything.

907
00:57:49,524 --> 00:57:50,984
It's too much to...

908
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,694
Mm.

909
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,374
Come see. Your recidivist, here,

910
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:08,210
Nicolas Santos, has damaged everything in your office.

911
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,087
Everyone is shocked.

912
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:12,756
Look, he tossed your files in the air,

913
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:14,549
he threw the table, smashed it up!

914
00:58:14,758 --> 00:58:16,885
Smashed the chairs.

915
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,388
There's more to it than buying them.

916
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:22,265
Look, everything is damaged.
That's the only patch

917
00:58:22,474 --> 00:58:25,018
I was able to save!
That guy was in some state!

918
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:26,812
What did he want?

919
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,814
I don't know! He was furious you weren't here,

920
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:34,027
I was here! Fuck, I'm going to smash her, that fat whore,

921
00:58:34,236 --> 00:58:35,946
She let my life on the Internet.

922
00:58:36,405 --> 00:58:38,490
There! That's the other con with his blog.

923
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:45,038
Well, I called the cops, they will mobilize
someone in close proximity, just in case.

924
00:58:45,664 --> 00:58:48,417
Do you think that would be useful?
He's not that dangerous.

925
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,336
Be polite, and not asshole.

926
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:54,506
It could be annoying. Be the cool guy.

927
00:58:54,715 --> 00:58:56,800
Since you have neither have a wife or child,

928
00:58:57,009 --> 00:59:00,303
we'll put everything on your case.
You're unemployed...

929
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:02,764
but an unemployed researcher.

930
00:59:02,973 --> 00:59:04,049
OK.

931
00:59:04,158 --> 00:59:06,935
They must feel that you have a healthy life,

932
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,478
with responsibilities,

933
00:59:08,687 --> 00:59:11,023
professional.
I am unstable.

934
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:16,820
Know that you always start with disgust.

935
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:18,121
What do you mean?

936
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,740
Some avoid the dumplings,

937
00:59:19,948 --> 00:59:22,242
you go into it. You face the disorderly.

938
00:59:22,451 --> 00:59:25,245
And in your case, it would be Leslie Chevalier.

939
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:28,081
OK. How do I dress?

940
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,792
Not too chic. They would see a strategy.

941
00:59:31,793 --> 00:59:34,421
Is it okay?
Yes, I am fine. No, I'm afraid.

942
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:37,257
Say that your strength is your mind.

943
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,843
Is this a joke?
No.

944
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,294
For two reasons:

945
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:43,638
They wouldn't believe a nice guy would want to kill,

946
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:46,433
and statistically good looking ones
win more than the ugly.

947
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:50,854
And they are also more indulgent
with an intelligent guy.

948
00:59:51,063 --> 00:59:52,105
They would identify with the same.

949
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:54,608
Don't hesitate to come out of words...

950
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:57,152
visible, ostensible.

951
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,654
Obviously, incontestable.

952
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,239
Yes, assured.

953
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,375
Are you going to follow me everywhere?

954
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:13,668
Yes, everywhere.

955
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,670
Finally, it's time for work.

956
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:20,634
But I know how to keep a certain distance

957
01:00:20,842 --> 01:00:22,552
while ensuring your protection.

958
01:00:24,012 --> 01:00:25,071
OK.

959
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:30,977
You tricked me, I will destroy you psyche.

960
01:00:31,186 --> 01:00:34,106
You will die by yourself on the inside.

961
01:00:34,314 --> 01:00:36,483
You're a human waste in this cosmos.

962
01:00:36,691 --> 01:00:39,194
Your cowardice left me an indelible trace,

963
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,612
I will be angry with you for life.

964
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:45,909
Or, remind me, my love,
you don't see how I suffer, it's inhumane.

965
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:47,152
Or...

966
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,746
You big pile of shit, you will swallow your arrogance.

967
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:52,916
Sociopath shit, reality will blow you up.

968
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:54,876
I dreamed I was taking your head

969
01:00:55,085 --> 01:00:56,837
to smash it against a wall.

970
01:00:57,045 --> 01:00:59,673
Again, I dream of skinning you alive, in bits,

971
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:03,635
very slowly, with a Swiss knife.
The joy in thinking of you,

972
01:01:03,844 --> 01:01:06,972
your deeds, I weep for you.
Finally peace, I love you

973
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,765
and still shit on your grave.

974
01:01:08,974 --> 01:01:12,269
I don't have time to continue to
read this collection of poetry.

975
01:01:12,894 --> 01:01:16,148
Miss Chevalier, explain to us
the context of these emails.

976
01:01:16,356 --> 01:01:19,693
Yes, I lived 6 months with Vincent, in 2008,

977
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:24,447
He was someone perfect, until I decided to breakup.

978
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:27,492
He became violent, he did not accept my decision.

979
01:01:28,702 --> 01:01:31,163
I fled for months, I was afraid of him.

980
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:33,573
Miss Spick?

981
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:36,418
You speak of violence.

982
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:39,254
Did he physically assault you?

983
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:41,047
He tried.

984
01:01:41,144 --> 01:01:43,967
But I managed to escape.

985
01:01:44,759 --> 01:01:46,845
He sexually assaulted you?
No.

986
01:01:46,945 --> 01:01:50,557
Why wait so long to report it?

987
01:01:50,765 --> 01:01:52,601
I recognized myself in her.

988
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,352
That it should not happen again.

989
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:58,940
Did you experience violence from other partners?

990
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:05,530
Don't you have several complaints filed
against five of them for similar acts?

991
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,840
Yes.

992
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,327
And yet you did not you come forward
on three of them with your testimonials?

993
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:13,288
That has nothing to do with this! Vincent was violent.

994
01:02:13,872 --> 01:02:16,708
I may read my testimony.
You may? Very good.

995
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:18,460
I have no further questions.

996
01:02:18,793 --> 01:02:20,670
I greatly respect Miss Spick,

997
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:22,631
but I like the idea of ​​transparency.

998
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,341
I am on the side of justice,

999
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:28,553
that's why that I did not ask for a lawyer.

1000
01:02:28,762 --> 01:02:31,431
This would have created a barrier
between myself and my defense.

1001
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,099
Thank you, Mr.Gonzalez.

1002
01:02:35,894 --> 01:02:37,938
Mr.Mazetti.
Miss Scorr,

1003
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:40,607
Did he snatch your panties violently?

1004
01:02:40,815 --> 01:02:42,150
Yes, very violently.

1005
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:45,862
He rushed at me.

1006
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:50,325
I was frightened, under those conditions.

1007
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,077
What happened to your panties?

1008
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:54,120
Maybe he kept it.

1009
01:02:54,329 --> 01:02:57,791
I never saw her panties. She did not wear them.
Quiet!

1010
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,626
Quiet please!

1011
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:00,919
I couldn't have done anything,

1012
01:03:01,127 --> 01:03:04,005
had Victoria respected the confidentiality clause.

1013
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:06,049
With regards to the blog, that is an auto-fiction.

1014
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:10,345
I mixed elements of my personal life
with imagination, fantasy.

1015
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,805
The problem is that, Mr.Gonzales,

1016
01:03:12,013 --> 01:03:15,517
your heroine bears the same name as my client.

1017
01:03:16,143 --> 01:03:18,895
She is a lawyer, like my client.

1018
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:21,147
You talk about clients who exist

1019
01:03:21,356 --> 01:03:27,279
in her life, who she defended.
And worse, you talk of an liaison with a magistrate.

1020
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,616
This constitutes to my client a similarity

1021
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:35,578
and you tell us, you mix truth and fantasy etc?

1022
01:03:35,787 --> 01:03:40,166
But the reader, is unable to
totally comprehend all this.

1023
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:42,168
So! What will the reader believe in?

1024
01:03:42,377 --> 01:03:44,754
He will believe in the worst,
the most seedy...

1025
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:48,383
that my client had sexual relations with judges.

1026
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:52,595
So you mess up her reputation, her work,

1027
01:03:52,804 --> 01:03:55,974
her credibility and you splash the whole profession

1028
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:59,686
with your infamous remarks, and that,
Your honor, is intolerable.

1029
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:03,148
Your Honor, I see the deceit in
the remarks made by the Counsel,

1030
01:04:03,356 --> 01:04:05,650
I trust the intellect of the readers.

1031
01:04:06,401 --> 01:04:07,944
And speaking of literature,

1032
01:04:08,153 --> 01:04:11,239
I quote Flaubert, who said, "I am Madame Bovary".

1033
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,159
Well I would say, "I'm Vicky Spock".

1034
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,995
Unfortunately, you are Mr.Gonzalez

1035
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:18,663
and you have no imagination.

1036
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:20,457
That was for you.

1037
01:04:20,665 --> 01:04:21,733
I was designated

1038
01:04:21,741 --> 01:04:24,794
a whore while sexually, it isn't sexual.

1039
01:04:25,003 --> 01:04:27,756
Then Why did this client destroy your office?

1040
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:32,385
He thinks I slept with the judge
who sentenced him, it was anything but.

1041
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:34,095
He felt throughly betrayed.

1042
01:04:34,554 --> 01:04:37,974
You could have slept with the judge to help your client?

1043
01:04:38,266 --> 01:04:41,519
No, I was wrong, but not at that point.

1044
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:46,066
But you were fairly well to sleep with a judge, out of envy.

1045
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:47,400
Yes, yes.

1046
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:50,153
I laid with desire, not by calculation.

1047
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:54,449
In a sense, I think that

1048
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:55,658
you would be flattered.

1049
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:56,868
Flattered?

1050
01:04:57,077 --> 01:04:58,286
Yes, he writes about your life.

1051
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:02,415
Which means somewhere, there's interest and admiration.

1052
01:05:02,624 --> 01:05:06,378
He don't write about something
which does not interest readers.

1053
01:05:06,586 --> 01:05:07,879
It's almost a statement.

1054
01:05:09,798 --> 01:05:11,049
You kidding?

1055
01:05:11,633 --> 01:05:12,684
Nevertheless,

1056
01:05:12,692 --> 01:05:15,053
be fascinated to someone for having written that.

1057
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:16,888
Be it looting, stealing...

1058
01:05:17,305 --> 01:05:20,183
Usually, people send others shabby text.

1059
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:23,061
He transformed your failure in a sublime trick.

1060
01:05:27,232 --> 01:05:30,276
Yes, yes. It's beautiful just
as you believe in humanity.

1061
01:05:34,272 --> 01:05:37,325
Eve, pet the dog.
Miss Scorr, for BFM TV.

1062
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:39,869
What...? No comments.

1063
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:41,955
Please, Miss Scorr.

1064
01:05:42,163 --> 01:05:44,541
When the animal finds itself confronting a person

1065
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:46,209
who hurt his owner,

1066
01:05:46,418 --> 01:05:50,004
it has a backward reaction, out of fear. It is a body language.

1067
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:57,387
A set of fairly readable signals, the look,
finally the position of the eyes, ears, body,

1068
01:05:57,595 --> 01:05:59,389
The tail, is very important.

1069
01:05:59,597 --> 01:06:01,933
The study wag clearly shows a stressed dog,

1070
01:06:02,142 --> 01:06:04,978
the frightened will wag the tail towards the left,

1071
01:06:05,353 --> 01:06:09,065
while a confident and happy dog
will wag to the right.

1072
01:06:09,274 --> 01:06:12,777
What did you observe from the tests on the dog?

1073
01:06:12,986 --> 01:06:14,779
Yes! I'm starting the video.

1074
01:06:15,655 --> 01:06:16,722
Here,

1075
01:06:16,731 --> 01:06:20,243
in the first test, when one presents the dog, Jacques,

1076
01:06:20,452 --> 01:06:24,122
a lambda shirt, it wags the tail to the right.

1077
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,583
While in the second test,

1078
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:31,045
when presented with a shirt of the accused,
it acts differently.

1079
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:34,007
It seems worried and wags the tail to the left.

1080
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,177
This is a statistical study,

1081
01:06:37,385 --> 01:06:39,804
It is an approximation.
Mr.Mazetti?

1082
01:06:40,013 --> 01:06:42,182
Defense has no comment.
Miss Spick?

1083
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:44,893
How long have you been practicing

1084
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,562
your profession as an expert on justice?

1085
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,821
11 years.

1086
01:06:48,830 --> 01:06:49,906
Very good.

1087
01:06:49,914 --> 01:06:53,485
During these 11 years,
have you come across cases of possessive dogs?

1088
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:57,947
Can you confirm that the animals

1089
01:06:58,156 --> 01:06:59,741
may have be dissatisfied

1090
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,160
if their masters had not a tender relationship?

1091
01:07:02,827 --> 01:07:04,704
Yes, I do.

1092
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:08,833
It can therefore react negatively
to the presence of the accused,

1093
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,585
not because it had

1094
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:14,047
aggression towards the victim, but due to

1095
01:07:14,255 --> 01:07:15,965
tenderness or sexual issues?

1096
01:07:16,174 --> 01:07:17,467
It's not that simple.

1097
01:07:17,675 --> 01:07:18,718
Answer "yes" or "no".

1098
01:07:19,385 --> 01:07:20,545
So...yes.

1099
01:07:20,678 --> 01:07:22,639
Very good. I have no further questions.

1100
01:07:23,056 --> 01:07:25,266
Good, bring in the dog, please.

1101
01:07:26,017 --> 01:07:28,228
Given the exceptional nature of his testimony,

1102
01:07:28,436 --> 01:07:31,648
I ask you not to laugh or make sudden gestures.

1103
01:07:31,856 --> 01:07:35,944
Mr.Verban, will interpret what the dog expresses.

1104
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:37,862
Miss Scorr,

1105
01:07:38,488 --> 01:07:41,299
if you could get closer to the dog.

1106
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:44,577
And stand straight before him, for a moment.

1107
01:07:53,545 --> 01:08:02,554
Good. Mr.Kossarski, approach and touch
Miss Scorr's arm for example.

1108
01:08:16,651 --> 01:08:18,194
Counsel, anything to add?

1109
01:08:18,403 --> 01:08:20,280
May I come forward?
Yes.

1110
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,465
Thank you.

1111
01:08:36,379 --> 01:08:37,446
Please.

1112
01:08:37,672 --> 01:08:38,756
Mr.Verban?

1113
01:08:39,257 --> 01:08:42,677
The animal seems very disturbed.

1114
01:08:47,807 --> 01:08:53,313
He was born at a Buddhist sect which made him,
misanthropic by the age of 13,

1115
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:57,275
The mystery remained as to the possibility

1116
01:08:57,483 --> 01:09:00,069
that this community advocating serenity

1117
01:09:00,278 --> 01:09:03,156
could have nurtured a tortured mind, hysterical,

1118
01:09:03,364 --> 01:09:05,617
an Apostle of liberalism than his own.

1119
01:09:05,825 --> 01:09:08,953
It left traces in her relation to men.

1120
01:09:09,162 --> 01:09:12,040
She had an especially sexual cerebral,

1121
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,417
a simple vision of a beautiful pleading.

1122
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:18,880
An avocado sown could make her happy at once.

1123
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:22,050
I felt useless,

1124
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:27,055
She had become a potential monster,
a being totally devoid of emotions.

1125
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,433
Her existence than to his desire for mastery.

1126
01:09:30,642 --> 01:09:31,851
Before this phallic woman,

1127
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:34,354
I was invisible, but I recorded everything.

1128
01:09:34,562 --> 01:09:35,938
Mr.Gonzalez.

1129
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,867
What are you looking for us believe?

1130
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:42,612
That this is a novel of pure imagination?

1131
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:46,407
If I may assert the opposite,
I shall be accused of slander.

1132
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,910
I, therefore reply this is fiction.

1133
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,328
OK, it's fiction.

1134
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:53,456
The portrait you make of your heroine

1135
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:54,832
is of a prospective character.

1136
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,293
Yes, but that's the freedom of the novelist.

1137
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:59,837
Who would believe that you didn't

1138
01:10:00,046 --> 01:10:02,840
knowingly include objective elements

1139
01:10:03,049 --> 01:10:05,718
for everyone to realize the fiction in hindsight,

1140
01:10:05,927 --> 01:10:07,887
the defamatory portrayal of Miss Spick?

1141
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,018
I have a virile sexuality?

1142
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:18,106
No. It's not like we had practiced a lot.

1143
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,736
Am I a cold monster and calculator?

1144
01:10:24,987 --> 01:10:28,282
Everyone is a little bit.
No not You. You, you...

1145
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,119
not malicious. You're a good person.

1146
01:10:31,327 --> 01:10:32,412
Not at all.

1147
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:35,039
You're wrong, I'm not a good person.

1148
01:10:35,248 --> 01:10:38,000
I own nothing, maybe that's what makes me

1149
01:10:38,209 --> 01:10:39,919
sympathetic or harmless.

1150
01:10:40,294 --> 01:10:44,090
I don't appreciate you for these reasons,
that's not what I feel.

1151
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:47,427
It isn't because I feel superior to you.

1152
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:50,530
I don't know.

1153
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:52,974
Even if that were the case,

1154
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:54,242
it is always that.

1155
01:10:54,976 --> 01:10:56,602
I appreciate you for your...

1156
01:10:57,061 --> 01:10:58,730
human qualities.

1157
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:05,945
You represent an area of non-danger for me.

1158
01:11:06,154 --> 01:11:07,697
You have become a priority.

1159
01:11:09,824 --> 01:11:11,826
I don't know how I should take it.

1160
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:13,594
Good.

1161
01:11:30,984 --> 01:11:32,094
Nantes: Witness has 4 legs

1162
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:35,894
Never seen before in the court of Nantes.
A dog witness to an attempted murder...by Estelle Comillac

1163
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:37,994
Canine trial to the limit of it's power.

1164
01:11:40,271 --> 01:11:42,023
Bring in Daisy and her handler, please.

1165
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,461
Come here.

1166
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,946
This trial is turning out to be ridiculous.

1167
01:11:49,155 --> 01:11:51,574
Mr.Mazetti, I would ask you to remain silent.

1168
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:55,161
Monsieur.
Hello.

1169
01:11:56,954 --> 01:11:59,207
Are you related or an allied party?

1170
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,250
I am a friend of the bride.

1171
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:03,169
Do you have a statement to make?

1172
01:12:03,377 --> 01:12:05,046
No.
Miss Spick?

1173
01:12:05,136 --> 01:12:06,246
Yes.

1174
01:12:07,715 --> 01:12:08,883
Mr Kleinberg,

1175
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:12,470
do you rent your monkey for tricks, is that correct?

1176
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:13,738
Yes, that's right.

1177
01:12:14,305 --> 01:12:18,017
What were you doing at the wedding?
We had to put up a small number,

1178
01:12:18,226 --> 01:12:19,685
so we came up to do that.

1179
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,729
And after the show?

1180
01:12:22,688 --> 01:12:24,816
We stayed up, until 3:00 in the morning.

1181
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:26,984
And what did you do with Daisy?

1182
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:29,821
She was with me, she was in the mood,

1183
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:32,406
so we danced and she took pictures.

1184
01:12:32,698 --> 01:12:33,908
She took pictures?
Yes.

1185
01:12:34,492 --> 01:12:36,118
Can you show us the pictures?
Yes.

1186
01:12:37,245 --> 01:12:38,496
We'll take a picture? OK?

1187
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:40,957
Here. With the finger.

1188
01:12:41,165 --> 01:12:42,375
Like I showed you.

1189
01:12:48,089 --> 01:12:49,131
Just like that.

1190
01:12:51,384 --> 01:12:52,593
Please!

1191
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:57,682
Here, like that. Go ahead.

1192
01:12:58,516 --> 01:12:59,575
Photo.

1193
01:13:00,893 --> 01:13:03,271
What did you do with the pictures taken?

1194
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,481
I have...Ah no, no.

1195
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,149
Silence!
Stay here.

1196
01:13:07,942 --> 01:13:10,987
I transferred them on to my computer.
Good. Thank you.

1197
01:13:12,697 --> 01:13:13,948
Continue, Counsel.
Yes.

1198
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:18,870
Look at these images taken during the marriage.

1199
01:13:19,078 --> 01:13:22,790
These are people who danced on the track with desserts

1200
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:25,334
served an hour before the event.

1201
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:27,545
On your left, recognizable in her dress,

1202
01:13:27,753 --> 01:13:30,840
Eve Scorr dancing back and forth.
Zooming in,

1203
01:13:31,257 --> 01:13:34,844
we see details appearing, thanks to the flash.

1204
01:13:35,928 --> 01:13:38,806
We see transparently that Miss Scorr
isn't wearing any panties.

1205
01:13:39,223 --> 01:13:40,516
Now, Miss Scorr says that

1206
01:13:40,725 --> 01:13:42,435
her panties were snatched from her.

1207
01:13:42,643 --> 01:13:44,854
Therein lies 3 possibilities:

1208
01:13:45,062 --> 01:13:46,564
Either my client snatched

1209
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:49,066
her panties an hour before the event.

1210
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:50,318
Miss Scorr

1211
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:53,237
handed over panties between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM

1212
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:55,990
for an impossible reason to imagine

1213
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:58,200
which does not figure on her testimony.

1214
01:13:58,409 --> 01:14:01,704
Or perhaps, or perhaps, simply lied.

1215
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:04,398
(DAT DERE BY TONY BENNETT)

1216
01:14:04,498 --> 01:14:08,486
* Daddy! Hey daddy!

1217
01:14:08,586 --> 01:14:09,687
Miss Spick.

1218
01:14:10,296 --> 01:14:11,964
Could we get a picture, please.

1219
01:14:12,064 --> 01:14:13,282
* What's that there? *

1220
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,759
A photo with the monkey.

1221
01:14:16,869 --> 01:14:20,969
* Hey daddy, that's him *
* Hey look at that over there! *

1222
01:14:21,069 --> 01:14:23,969
* Daddy O hey, daddy O ho *
* Look over there! *

1223
01:14:25,069 --> 01:14:27,999
* Hey why they go in there? *
* And what they doing there? *

1224
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:30,999
* And daddy can I have that big elephant over there? *

1225
01:14:32,099 --> 01:14:34,999
* And who's that in my chair? *
* And what's she doing there?

1226
01:14:35,099 --> 01:14:37,899
* Daddy, O hey, can I go over there? *

1227
01:14:37,999 --> 01:14:42,186
* Hey daddy, what's a square? *
* And where do we get air? *

1228
01:14:42,286 --> 01:14:43,294
Hello.

1229
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,382
* And daddy can I have that big elephant over there? *

1230
01:14:46,332 --> 01:14:49,210
Damn, the computer! I damaged it.

1231
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:50,420
You did?

1232
01:14:52,338 --> 01:14:53,547
Are you fine?

1233
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:55,466
No, I'm not, actually...

1234
01:14:55,675 --> 01:14:59,553
Wait, I'll open door and come back listen to you.

1235
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:02,740
What are you doing here?

1236
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:05,226
I have ideas to improve my character.

1237
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:06,936
What are you talking about?

1238
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:09,397
I feel completely useless.

1239
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,900
You have nothing to do with that, that's my job.

1240
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,820
Vincent, don't change your attitude facing the jury.

1241
01:15:17,071 --> 01:15:19,198
You have a bodyguard now?

1242
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:23,369
What is it?
Sorry, I met him in the street.

1243
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:25,079
OK, that's okay.

1244
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:27,540
What's the matter?

1245
01:15:27,832 --> 01:15:28,891
Oh, Vincent!

1246
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,418
I'm having a panic attack.

1247
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,586
No! Everything will be alright.

1248
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:34,630
Statistically, it is proven,

1249
01:15:34,839 --> 01:15:37,508
that if you survive a crash,
you will not get through another crash.

1250
01:15:37,717 --> 01:15:39,051
Mom!
Two seconds!

1251
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:42,054
It's going to be fine, just get some rest. OK?

1252
01:15:42,722 --> 01:15:44,473
Sam, I'm going with him to talk.

1253
01:15:45,433 --> 01:15:46,508
Come on.

1254
01:15:46,517 --> 01:15:47,676
It will be fine.

1255
01:15:47,685 --> 01:15:49,562
Victoria, my life is completely...

1256
01:15:50,855 --> 01:15:52,940
I'll take rest tomorrow.
What?

1257
01:15:53,691 --> 01:15:54,942
I have become more invisible.

1258
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:56,218
I exist more.

1259
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:57,302
I dream...

1260
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,370
Are you taking notes?

1261
01:15:58,462 --> 01:15:59,739
No, I'm writing a text message.

1262
01:15:59,947 --> 01:16:01,449
No this is not possible.

1263
01:16:03,576 --> 01:16:05,953
Étienne, can you get him out of here?

1264
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,221
Thank you.
Out now, Monsieur.

1265
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:09,331
There you see your true face.

1266
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,750
I don't count on you.

1267
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:14,070
No! Don't underestimate yourself.

1268
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,715
I don't underestimate myself,
I am leaving because I have esteem.

1269
01:16:18,924 --> 01:16:21,927
I have known you all your life,
and you, you know nothing about me.

1270
01:16:22,136 --> 01:16:24,346
You don't know why I wanted to live here.

1271
01:16:25,431 --> 01:16:28,517
Yes Yes. Of course yes.
Well no.

1272
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:30,853
I did all this to save me from my life.

1273
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:33,189
Good...in English.

1274
01:16:33,397 --> 01:16:35,524
Listen.
English? When I...

1275
01:16:35,733 --> 01:16:37,777
arrived here, I realized that...

1276
01:16:37,985 --> 01:16:39,570
I liked you more than I was thinking

1277
01:16:39,779 --> 01:16:41,155
And it surprised me.

1278
01:16:41,614 --> 01:16:42,990
I like you very much.

1279
01:16:43,741 --> 01:16:46,452
Even when you "tremble" on the floor "in drool",

1280
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:50,122
when you slept with all these guys in night, I like you.

1281
01:16:50,498 --> 01:16:51,582
But I was thinking "that"...

1282
01:16:51,791 --> 01:16:53,667
that the situation would change.

1283
01:16:54,168 --> 01:16:55,711
I was thinking "that"...

1284
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,880
you will give me a...

1285
01:16:58,089 --> 01:17:01,092
a better place in your life, in your work...

1286
01:17:02,593 --> 01:17:03,886
And in fact, nothing at all.

1287
01:17:07,431 --> 01:17:09,308
You've enjoyed it without realizing it.

1288
01:17:09,517 --> 01:17:11,227
You're the one who underestimates yourself.

1289
01:17:11,435 --> 01:17:12,520
I stole money from you.

1290
01:17:12,937 --> 01:17:15,648
What?
I stole a bit, at first,

1291
01:17:15,856 --> 01:17:19,401
I found it moving that you trusted me, confided in me.

1292
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:23,155
You would've never known had I had not told you,

1293
01:17:23,364 --> 01:17:25,991
and you would've never known I exist, had I not left.

1294
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,786
No, Sam! Don't go. Not on the day before my pleading.

1295
01:17:28,994 --> 01:17:30,329
Sam?
I will not change my mind.

1296
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:32,414
Please stay.
No.

1297
01:17:36,544 --> 01:17:37,628
Is everything all right, ma'am?

1298
01:17:39,505 --> 01:17:40,714
Do you need help?

1299
01:17:43,509 --> 01:17:46,387
Yes, you may enter. I don't feel very well.

1300
01:17:59,441 --> 01:18:02,361
Can you stay tonight? I don't feel assured.

1301
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,863
Okay.
Thank you very much.

1302
01:18:04,071 --> 01:18:06,073
I'll install the sofa bed.

1303
01:18:06,323 --> 01:18:08,442
Girls, we are going to sleep.

1304
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:14,290
Can I use your shower?
Yes, it's over there.

1305
01:18:14,582 --> 01:18:15,583
Okay.

1306
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:55,706
Where is she?
In the bedroom.

1307
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,214
What did you do?

1308
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:05,132
Let's take her to the bathroom.

1309
01:19:21,065 --> 01:19:22,358
How much did you take?

1310
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:24,777
I don't know, a few of them.

1311
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,571
It was to sleep, but...

1312
01:19:29,323 --> 01:19:31,200
Good, mademoiselle, you are young,

1313
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:34,161
You have a whole life in front of you.

1314
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,038
Don't let go like that.

1315
01:19:36,747 --> 01:19:38,832
Drink lots of water and rest.

1316
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,960
Your body will recover slowly.

1317
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,753
Thank you, how much do you owe?

1318
01:19:42,962 --> 01:19:44,088
€47, please.

1319
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:48,092
Contractually, I'm done with work, but I could stay.

1320
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:51,553
No, it's good, thank you very much.
Thanks for everything, Étienne.

1321
01:19:51,762 --> 01:19:54,807
You helped us. Thank you very much. Goodbye.

1322
01:19:55,808 --> 01:19:57,184
Quick, we're in a hurry.

1323
01:19:59,144 --> 01:20:01,480
I can't go.
Get up.

1324
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:02,698
I...

1325
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:05,192
Will call...
You will have to go plead on all fours.

1326
01:20:06,986 --> 01:20:08,404
Take some sugar.

1327
01:20:08,612 --> 01:20:10,447
I will not plead sitting.

1328
01:20:10,656 --> 01:20:11,748
I'm very good,

1329
01:20:11,757 --> 01:20:13,867
You are a force of nature.
No, your aren't a force of nature.

1330
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,369
Did you see my eyes?

1331
01:20:15,577 --> 01:20:18,122
They are beautiful. We'll put on some makeup.

1332
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,957
I'm gonna get out of the bar.
I can't do this.

1333
01:20:20,165 --> 01:20:21,917
Get up and get dressed.

1334
01:20:22,126 --> 01:20:24,753
Please don't argue with me.
Stop, come on.

1335
01:20:24,962 --> 01:20:27,339
You are going.
Slowly. I am going to vomit.

1336
01:20:27,548 --> 01:20:28,841
We'll vomit together.

1337
01:20:32,636 --> 01:20:35,848
You wouldn't have a thing, amphetamines,
a trick for...?

1338
01:20:36,515 --> 01:20:38,392
Are you crazy?
It's for work.

1339
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:41,678
Good.

1340
01:20:44,398 --> 01:20:45,774
I'll be replaced...

1341
01:20:45,983 --> 01:20:47,860
This is for your once a lifetime plead.

1342
01:20:50,029 --> 01:20:51,071
Here, inhale.

1343
01:20:53,574 --> 01:20:54,616
Again.

1344
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:57,819
Are we good?

1345
01:21:23,771 --> 01:21:25,105
You frighten me, Victoria.
No...

1346
01:21:26,357 --> 01:21:29,109
Deep down, I believe in you.

1347
01:21:32,196 --> 01:21:33,197
Why is he there?

1348
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:35,265
Why?

1349
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:36,367
Why are you here?

1350
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:40,496
I saved her life for the girl
who will try to save yours.

1351
01:21:40,704 --> 01:21:43,165
Basically, I saved your life. So fuck you.

1352
01:21:48,921 --> 01:21:50,297
How's Victoria doing?
Yes.

1353
01:21:50,506 --> 01:21:52,466
Leave me alone for half hour.

1354
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,226
OK?

1355
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,366
Miss.Spick, your turn to speak.

1356
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,464
Could a dog be heard as a witness?

1357
01:23:14,339 --> 01:23:16,008
The question was raised, today,

1358
01:23:16,216 --> 01:23:18,969
in a case of attempted murder.

1359
01:23:20,345 --> 01:23:24,099
I ask you to be vigilant to these experiments.

1360
01:23:32,357 --> 01:23:33,901
I would like to add

1361
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:35,986
that the intelligence of a dog

1362
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:38,780
is 51% genetic.

1363
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:42,576
And that according to the top dog breeds,

1364
01:23:44,036 --> 01:23:46,246
the dalmatian ranks at the bottom of the list,

1365
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,457
behind the poodle,

1366
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:50,876
the Doberman,

1367
01:23:52,294 --> 01:23:55,172
the German Shepherd and about thirty other breeds.

1368
01:24:19,696 --> 01:24:20,906
In other words,

1369
01:24:21,365 --> 01:24:22,482
If we

1370
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:24,576
were to trust the word of a dog,

1371
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:29,915
the dalmatian isn't the brightest to
communicate something to us.

1372
01:25:00,904 --> 01:25:02,030
How can we...

1373
01:25:04,157 --> 01:25:05,367
how can we

1374
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:09,371
accuse someone of attempted murder?

1375
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,254
How can we...

1376
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:23,135
And getting back to him...

1377
01:25:26,597 --> 01:25:28,056
He's my client.

1378
01:25:28,807 --> 01:25:30,267
He's supposed to be the aggressor.

1379
01:25:30,475 --> 01:25:32,269
While continuing to pursue her,

1380
01:25:32,477 --> 01:25:35,647
which seems irrational given the circumstances,

1381
01:25:37,149 --> 01:25:38,817
and leave home again?

1382
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:51,096
You can accuse

1383
01:25:51,204 --> 01:25:52,581
my client of softness,

1384
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:55,934
cowardice,

1385
01:25:57,544 --> 01:25:58,603
weakness.

1386
01:25:59,796 --> 01:26:02,382
It isn't a model of virtue.
Oh no!

1387
01:26:05,135 --> 01:26:06,845
But it does not make him a criminal.

1388
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:28,533
Miss Spick, was that a victory?

1389
01:26:28,742 --> 01:26:30,494
Much has been said about animals,

1390
01:26:30,702 --> 01:26:33,372
what was the role of the judge in this case?

1391
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:37,626
The truth prevailed, which is essential.

1392
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:38,960
Mr.Kossarski?

1393
01:26:39,169 --> 01:26:41,380
It is possible that the truth
may have been sad,

1394
01:26:41,588 --> 01:26:43,048
but...
Thank you, we're in a hurry.

1395
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:45,342
Mr.Kossarski, please. Monsieur?

1396
01:26:46,718 --> 01:26:47,886
Miss Spick?

1397
01:26:51,932 --> 01:26:54,351
You were brilliant! It's incredible!

1398
01:26:54,559 --> 01:26:55,686
What did you do?

1399
01:26:56,895 --> 01:26:58,230
I feel revived.

1400
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,649
Thank Sam, really.

1401
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:02,567
You gave a lot.

1402
01:27:05,737 --> 01:27:08,031
Did you not you see him after the verdict?
Who? Sam?

1403
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,533
Sam.
No.

1404
01:27:11,284 --> 01:27:12,369
This is like, as it was before,

1405
01:27:13,453 --> 01:27:16,581
I did not realize I was happy and there I realize...

1406
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,002
Fuck, I feel so relieved.

1407
01:27:23,046 --> 01:27:24,339
Me too.

1408
01:27:25,924 --> 01:27:27,592
I can't believe it's over.

1409
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,182
You look tired, you need to rest.

1410
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,228
Do you know what would give me peace?

1411
01:27:39,146 --> 01:27:40,689
Let's see that one more time.

1412
01:27:44,776 --> 01:27:46,027
Yeah, I would...

1413
01:27:46,236 --> 01:27:48,196
I should not have involved you in my stories.

1414
01:27:51,158 --> 01:27:53,493
It's certain, you'll get back together.

1415
01:27:54,244 --> 01:27:56,955
That, really, I think I could not.

1416
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:19,019
In her absence, the judge rejected the charges against me

1417
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:22,564
and ordered me to pay her €90 in damages.

1418
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:25,567
The trial brought me advertising in...

1419
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:30,113
No. Given the publicity that
the trial had brought me,

1420
01:28:30,322 --> 01:28:33,825
I was also ordered to change
the names of the characters.

1421
01:28:34,034 --> 01:28:37,412
I won, in exchange, the undisputed right

1422
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:41,082
to continue the blog and the film
gathered an unexpected publicity.

1423
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:45,462
I was proud that justice gave me back
my freedom of authorship.

1424
01:29:06,983 --> 01:29:09,653
You've reached the answering machine of Samuel and Mal.

1425
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:43,570
Sam?

1426
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:45,939
I kept calling you.

1427
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:48,483
I did not know where you were. We won the trial.

1428
01:29:49,192 --> 01:29:51,069
Thank you, because I'm thankful to you.

1429
01:29:51,278 --> 01:29:53,613
And also, the fact that, ah...

1430
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:55,740
you count on me,

1431
01:29:55,949 --> 01:29:57,033
very much.

1432
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:58,568
I understand

1433
01:29:58,577 --> 01:30:02,455
why you stole money from me,
you wanted to show me your interest.

1434
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,627
I want to prove to you my gratitude.

1435
01:30:08,712 --> 01:30:10,005
It's a bit too late.

1436
01:30:10,922 --> 01:30:13,216
It works well, chemically, between us?

1437
01:30:13,425 --> 01:30:14,509
Chemically?

1438
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:17,679
There's good chemistry in the works, don't you think?

1439
01:30:18,096 --> 01:30:20,390
I dunno, I don't understand what you are saying.

1440
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:23,810
I want to live with you.

1441
01:30:25,437 --> 01:30:27,647
Without paying me? I'm lost.

1442
01:30:27,856 --> 01:30:30,734
Oh yes, no. Of course, I'll pay you.

1443
01:30:30,942 --> 01:30:33,403
I'm joking, I'm not a whore.

1444
01:30:33,612 --> 01:30:36,615
I think that would be a good thing.

1445
01:30:36,823 --> 01:30:38,408
Finally, any relationship

1446
01:30:38,783 --> 01:30:39,951
deserves an exchange.

1447
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,078
No relationship is balanced.

1448
01:30:42,287 --> 01:30:43,538
The very notion of balance

1449
01:30:43,747 --> 01:30:46,207
ruins any possible form of connection.

1450
01:30:46,917 --> 01:30:48,460
The fact is, I'm afraid of you.

1451
01:30:49,461 --> 01:30:51,671
You have the sense of drama abnormally developed.

1452
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:53,340
Sam, I have...

1453
01:30:54,132 --> 01:30:56,801
I just understood that...

1454
01:31:00,013 --> 01:31:01,848
these last months...

1455
01:31:02,724 --> 01:31:05,352
I did not have time to realize that...

1456
01:31:06,603 --> 01:31:08,563
that I was in love with you.

1457
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:14,653
I understood this when you were gone,

1458
01:31:15,946 --> 01:31:17,530
I realized that...

1459
01:31:18,114 --> 01:31:20,742
I was happy with you. I wasn't aware,

1460
01:31:20,951 --> 01:31:22,118
but I was happy.

1461
01:31:22,327 --> 01:31:24,704
I said nothing, I had my head in the trial.

1462
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:26,122
Now I know.

1463
01:31:32,045 --> 01:31:33,104
I could

1464
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:34,881
give you courses in law,

1465
01:31:35,548 --> 01:31:37,842
to introduce you to all the lawyers of Paris...

1466
01:31:38,051 --> 01:31:40,095
Why did you wait so long?

1467
01:31:42,555 --> 01:31:43,640
I don't know.

1468
01:31:44,683 --> 01:31:47,227
I rarely have 2 seconds of inner peace.

1469
01:31:55,827 --> 01:32:04,027
* I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there *
* But she never comes and then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes *

1470
01:32:04,127 --> 01:32:12,827
* And I rise to face another day without her *
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1471
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:17,927
* It's just no good anymore *
* When you walk through the door of an empty room *

1472
01:32:18,027 --> 01:32:26,827
* And then you go inside and set a table for one *
* It's no fun when you spend a day without her *

1473
01:32:26,927 --> 01:32:31,927
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1474
01:32:32,027 --> 01:32:35,027
* We burst the pretty balloon *
* Took us to the moon *

1475
01:32:35,127 --> 01:32:37,927
* Such a beautiful thing *
* But it's ended now *

1476
01:32:38,027 --> 01:32:44,927
* And it sounds like a lie *
* If I say I'd rather die than live without her *

1477
01:32:45,027 --> 01:32:49,827
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1478
01:32:49,927 --> 01:32:52,927
* Love is a beautiful thing *
* When it knows how to swing *

1479
01:32:53,027 --> 01:32:57,027
* And it grooves like a clock *
* But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part *

1480
01:32:57,127 --> 01:33:06,027
* And it's breaking my heart to have to spend a day without her *
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *

1481
01:33:24,827 --> 01:33:29,927
* I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there *
* But she never comes *

1482
01:33:30,027 --> 01:33:36,927
* And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes *
* And I rise to face another day without her *

1483
01:33:37,027 --> 01:33:42,977
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do, do-do-do *
* Can't go on without her *

1484
01:33:43,077 --> 01:33:48,977
* Do-do-do, do-do-do-do *
* There's no song without her *

1485
01:33:49,077 --> 01:34:01,047
* It's all wrong without her *
* Can't go on without her *

1486
01:34:02,305 --> 01:35:02,294
