00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,879
<i>When ships are
in the middle of the ocean...</i>

3
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,299
<i>...where problems occur...</i>

4
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,178
<i>they can throw you overboard</i>

5
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,261
<i>into the sea.</i>

6
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:59,267
<i>It is dangerous for you
to make this documentary.</i>

7
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>There are many risks.</i>

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,155
If you're scared of dying, go home.

9
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,722
<i>My name is Ali.</i>

10
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,223
<i>That's me.</i>

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,559
<i>And for as long as I can remember,</i>

12
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,063
<i>I've been fascinated
with dolphins and whales.</i>

13
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,483
<i>My obsession with the ocean, though,</i>

14
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,111
<i>was really born
out of watching documentaries</i>

15
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,696
<i>from people like Jacques Cousteau,</i>

16
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>David Attenborough, and Sylvia Earle.</i>

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,662
<i>Watching their films opened up
a whole new world for me,</i>

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,581
<i>filled with an abundance of beauty,</i>

19
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,416
<i>color, and life.</i>

20
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,879
<i>I would dream of one day exploring
our thriving seas</i>

21
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>just like they did.</i>

22
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,175
<i>Capturing images
of all the extraordinary wildlife</i>

23
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,969
<i>that lived beneath the waves.</i>

24
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,474
<i>After finishing college,
I'd been working on other documentaries,</i>

25
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,018
<i>but at 22, I was ready
to embark on making my own film</i>

26
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,354
<i>on just how incredible the oceans were.</i>

27
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:35,113
<i>It's home for up to 80%
of all life on Earth.</i>

28
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,409
<i>And with the vast majority of our seas
still unexplored till this day,</i>

29
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>for me, the oceans were
an indestructible source of inspiration.</i>

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,376
<i>But not long into starting the project,</i>

31
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,755
<i>this romantic vision that I always had
of the ocean completely changed.</i>

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,527
<i>...beached whale found
off the country's coast earlier this week</i>

33
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,721
<i>had more than 30 plastic bags
inside its stomach.</i>

34
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,474
<i>It's the 29th whale of this
species to become stranded across Europe</i>

35
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,684
<i>in the last two weeks.</i>

36
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,645
<i>This represents the largest
stranding episode in the last 100 years.</i>

37
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,749
- <i>...washed up on a beach...
- In the UK, 4 others died</i>

38
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,027
<i>in a number of beachings nearby
in recent days...</i>

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>When news started coming in
of whales washing up on beaches,</i>

40
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,200
<i>even along the Southeast coast
of England where I lived,</i>

41
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,203
<i>I was forced to confront
a side of the story I never knew.</i>

42
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:28,041
<i>A story of just how huge our impact
on the seas had become.</i>

43
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,836
<i>These animals washing up
with their stomachs filled with plastic</i>

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>was devastating not only
because of their incredible intelligence,</i>

45
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,553
<i>but because they even help
keep the entire ocean alive.</i>

46
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,765
<i>When dolphins and whales
return to the surface to breathe,</i>

47
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>they fertilize tiny marine plants
in the ocean called phytoplankton,</i>

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,231
<i>which every year absorb four times
the amount of carbon dioxide</i>

49
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,107
<i>than the Amazon rain forest does,</i>

50
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,945
<i>and generates up to 85%
of the oxygen we breathe.</i>

51
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,950
<i>So in a world concerned with carbon
and climate change,</i>

52
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,662
<i>protecting these animals
meant protecting the entire planet.</i>

53
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,165
<i>The way I saw it was
if dolphins and whales die,</i>

54
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,625
<i>the ocean dies.</i>

55
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,877
<i>And if the ocean dies, so do we.</i>

56
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,422
<i>But with so many whales washing up dead,
the future looked bleak.</i>

57
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,134
<i>Plastic was invading every last corner
of the world's seas,</i>

58
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,597
<i>with huge floating garbage patches
accumulating in the middle of the ocean,</i>

59
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,267
<i>like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</i>

60
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,434
<i>In fact, today,</i>

61
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,396
<i>the equivalent
of a garbage truckload of plastic</i>

62
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,190
<i>is dumped in the sea every single minute,</i>

63
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,737
<i>joining the over 150 million tons
already floating there.</i>

64
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,409
<i>But this plastic breaks down into smaller
and smaller pieces known as microplastics,</i>

65
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,412
<i>which now outnumber the stars
in the Milky Way galaxy</i>

66
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,664
<i>by at least 500 times,</i>

67
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,875
<i>and is seeping into every living creature
in the ocean.</i>

68
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>Essentially, our oceans
have turned into a toxic plastic soup.</i>

69
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>And worst of all,
I was a massive part of the problem.</i>

70
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,430
<i>Although I signed petitions
and subscribed to ocean newsletters,</i>

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,141
<i>I did nothing to actually protect
what I loved.</i>

72
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,517
<i>So from then on,</i>

73
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,895
<i>I did what any self-respecting
Jacques Cousteau wannabe would do.</i>

74
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,523
<i>I became the plastic police.</i>

75
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>I donated to every ocean charity I could.</i>

76
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,113
<i>Attended beach cleanups,</i>

77
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,992
<i>and carried reusable cutlery
and a drink bottle wherever I went.</i>

78
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,327
<i>My mission was simple.</i>

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,912
<i>Stop the world from using
plastic toothbrushes,</i>

80
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,165
<i>straws, cutlery, bottles, bags,</i>

81
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,292
<i>or anything single-use plastic.</i>

82
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,378
<i>And I was gonna stop at nothing
until my message was heard.</i>

83
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,464
<i>Seaside Fish and Chips.</i>

84
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,132
Yeah, hi. My name's Ali.

85
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,885
I'm just wondering
if you'd swap out your plastic straws

86
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,095
'cause it's killing whales
and baby sea turtles.

87
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,473
Hello?

88
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,392
<i>But that didn't stop me
from tackling this plague of plastic.</i>

89
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,771
So, this is my first beach.
In just one hour,

90
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,774
I've been able to collect
three whole bags full of plastic trash.

91
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,901
There's takeaway food packaging,

92
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,403
there's cutlery, there's straws,
there's everything.

93
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,030
I even found Nemo.

94
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,948
Onto the next beach.

95
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,035
<i>But no matter what beach I went to</i>

96
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,661
<i>or how much I collected,</i>

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>there was always more plastic,
and more animals washing up.</i>

98
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,292
<i>After months of this,</i>

99
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,837
<i>and as I began to wonder if this really
was the best way to save marine life,</i>

100
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,672
<i>I came across this.</i>

101
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:26,135
Japan has confirmed it will resume
commercial whale hunting,

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,180
and is withdrawing from
the International Whaling Commission.

103
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:32,975
The country's whaling fleet
set sail for the Antarctic last Tuesday.

104
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,771
Tokyo says it plans to kill
despite a worldwide ban.

105
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,441
So, this is the news
I woke up to today.

106
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,861
The Japanese government want to
resume whaling in the Antarctic again.

107
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,906
I knew that dolphins and whales
were dying accidentally from plastic,

108
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,867
but I never dreamed
that they'd be targeted on purpose

109
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,246
by an industry I thought
only existed in the history books.

110
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:58,084
I did some research and found there's been
an international whaling ban since 1986.

111
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,587
However, several countries have operated
under the radar for years,

112
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,923
most notoriously<i>,</i> though, is Japan.

113
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,302
<i>Logistically, it was extremely challenging
to film or do anything</i>

114
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>about the whaling in Antarctica.</i>

115
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:13,099
<i>But I found there was one place
in the south of Japan</i>

116
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,185
<i>where this industry could still be seen
operating from the coast,</i>

117
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>in a place called Taiji,</i>

118
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:23,317
<i>where each year over 700 dolphins
and small whales are herded into a cove</i>

119
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,444
<i>for slaughter.</i>

120
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,653
<i>I wanted to find out</i>

121
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,364
<i>just how big of a threat
Japan's whaling practices were</i>

122
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,740
<i>compared to plastic.</i>

123
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,619
<i>So I set up a meeting
with one of the few activists</i>

124
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,999
<i>who'd been involved in this issue
for years, a guy named Ric O'Barry.</i>

125
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,751
The Japanese government
go through a lot of trouble

126
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,963
to make sure
that people don't know about this.

127
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,091
If you went there,
and you didn't know what you were doing,

128
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,344
you could get arrested,
and you could be in jail a very long time.

129
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,305
Because they're trying
to get rid of people

130
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,475
who are opposed to their war on dolphins.

131
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,393
When you first show up in Taiji,

132
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,104
immediately, the police are on you.

133
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,065
They're at your hotel.
They're following you everywhere you go.

134
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,526
You got the Yakuza,
you got the right wing,

135
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,113
you got the government, the fishermen,
you got everybody against you.

136
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,032
The room is bugged,
the telephone is bugged.

137
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,659
The television
is actually photographing you

138
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,036
while you're in your room.

139
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,706
So you ask what, how...
What happens when you go to Taiji?

140
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,501
Just know that all of those people
are watching you,

141
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,127
and they are trying to figure out,

142
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,171
"How do we take these people out?"

143
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,465
But if it's so risky to go,

144
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,259
and there are other issues
affecting the entire ocean,

145
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,888
like plastic washing up everywhere,
then why go to Taiji?

146
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,641
Showing up in Taiji with a camera
is extremely important.

147
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,059
If we can't fix this,

148
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,229
what are you talking about,
saving the ocean?

149
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,314
How can you do that?
You can't even fix this.

150
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,441
This is the size of a football field.

151
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,570
<i>My head was still
filled with questions,</i>

152
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,254
<i>but with the dolphin hunt just starting,</i>

153
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,699
<i>I knew that figuring out
what was going on in Taiji</i>

154
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,369
<i>would give me a better understanding
of the bigger picture</i>

155
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,620
<i>of how to save the ocean.</i>

156
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,790
<i>Either I stayed home picking up trash
on beaches all day,</i>

157
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,002
<i>or take a risk and find out
if there was a bigger threat to the sea.</i>

158
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,380
<i>So I dropped all my other projects,</i>

159
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:11,050
<i>packed my camera bags,
convinced my partner Lucy to join me,</i>

160
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,012
<i>and with the mission to expose
what was truly happening to our oceans,</i>

161
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,223
<i>got the next flight out to Japan.</i>

162
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,232
Where are you going today?

163
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,629
Oh, we just arrived.
We're just visiting the area.

164
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,097
- Holiday?
- Holiday. Yeah.

165
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,056
Drive safe.

166
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Thank you.

167
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,976
What the hell?

168
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,231
<i>From that point on,
we had an entourage of police,</i>

169
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,692
<i>secret service, undercover cops,</i>

170
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,320
<i>and the coast guard
following us everywhere.</i>

171
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,537
Is it the police?

172
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,457
Yeah, they're out there.
Let's go out the back.

173
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,928
So, arrived in Taiji,

174
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,931
and first thing in the morning,
decided to head to the harbor.

175
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,267
Pretty quickly,
boats start heading out to sea.

176
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,813
There was about 13 of them in total,
and they were gone for several hours.

177
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,066
When they returned,
they returned in formation

178
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,485
and were billowing black smoke
from their exhaust pipes.

179
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,363
And banging on poles in the water

180
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,532
to try and scare a huge pod of dolphins
closer to land,

181
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,119
and then maneuver them into a cove
where I'm standing above right now.

182
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,288
It's impossible to see exactly
what's going on.

183
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,831
There's a lot of splashing.

184
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,958
There's people down there
wrestling these dolphins.

185
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,962
Whatever is going on,
they don't want us filming.

186
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,712
Police are trying to search for us.

187
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,508
It's really tough conditions
to try and film this stuff.

188
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,954
The Taiji dolphin drives
continue to be supported,

189
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,500
underwritten, funded by
the marine park entertainment industry.

190
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,003
A live dolphin really is very expensive.

191
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,130
And so,

192
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:58,884
the big ticket is catching
young dolphins and whales,

193
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,512
and selling them to marine parks.

194
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,682
What captivity in concrete tanks does

195
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,978
is it takes away everything
that makes life worth living for them.

196
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,690
Everything they need to do, they can't do.

197
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:16,193
And everything they don't want to do,
they're forced to do.

198
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,780
<i>I had enjoyed going to these
marine parks my whole life,</i>

199
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,534
<i>but never even questioned how the animals
got there in the first place.</i>

200
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,996
<i>But now, knowing it was connected
to industries like whaling</i>

201
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,498
<i>made me pledge
to never go to these parks again.</i>

202
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,835
<i>But every day in Taiji
was like Groundhog Day,</i>

203
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,421
<i>witnessing boats go out,
dolphins driven in,</i>

204
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,507
<i>and the inevitable capture
and mass slaughter of the pod</i>

205
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,010
<i>again, and again, and again.</i>

206
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,810
<i>Before we knew it,
we'd been in Taiji for over a week,</i>

207
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,272
<i>but still couldn't figure out
why on Earth they were killing them,</i>

208
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,150
<i>since dead dolphins don't perform tricks.</i>

209
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,237
Lucy, show me again
what you just found out.

210
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,740
I've just been doing the maths
from the data online,

211
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,368
and from 2000 to 2015,
for every one dolphin captured,

212
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,996
at least 12 more were killed.
It doesn't make any sense.

213
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,332
I don't know why they're killing
all these dolphins.

214
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,796
So, if the annual Taiji dolphin drive
is fueled by the captivity industry,

215
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,130
it begs the question,

216
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,883
"Why kill the dolphins
that aren't selected for captivity?"

217
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,010
There's very little reason
to slaughter them.

218
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,012
There's no market for dolphin meat.

219
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,264
Why not just release them
back into the sea?

220
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,768
And the answer to that question
is pest control.

221
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,355
The fishermen view the dolphins
as competition.

222
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,190
They feel that they eat too many fish,

223
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,150
and if they get rid of the dolphins,

224
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,694
there will be more fish available
for them to catch.

225
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,324
Essentially, the slaughter
of these dolphins is a reaction

226
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,410
to the overfishing
that's happening here in Taiji.

227
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,249
<i>If this was true, that dolphins were
being blamed for the overfishing,</i>

228
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,335
<i>then boycotting marine parks
wasn't gonna stop this.</i>

229
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,171
<i>So to find out more,
we decided to visit a local fishing port</i>

230
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,965
<i>just a stone's throw from Taiji.</i>

231
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,388
<i>However, upon arrival, we quickly learned</i>

232
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,473
<i>this wasn't just any fishing port.</i>

233
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,105
Ali. Ali, what is it?

234
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,357
This is just tuna.

235
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,526
This is the tuna industry.

236
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,739
<i>We had just stumbled across one
of the largest tuna ports in the world,</i>

237
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,825
<i>which landed bluefin tuna,</i>

238
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,286
<i>the most expensive fish on the planet.</i>

239
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,539
<i>Just one of these fish sold
in Tokyo's fish market</i>

240
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,916
<i>for over three million dollars.</i>

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,376
<i>I had read about these fish.</i>

242
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,169
<i>They were like the cheetahs of the ocean,</i>

243
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,548
<i>warm-blooded,
and can accelerate faster than a Ferrari.</i>

244
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:46,760
<i>But due to high prices, the only direction
they were accelerating in</i>

245
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,095
<i>was into extinction.</i>

246
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,141
<i>Today, less than 3%
of the species remain.</i>

247
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,643
<i>They were once thriving just decades ago.</i>

248
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,067
It's not just bluefin though,
it's all tuna.

249
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,362
There's everything here.
This is sold around the world.

250
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,617
This is a $42-billion-a-year industry.
And it's at threat from overfishing.

251
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,702
Of course they're gonna
blame the dolphins.

252
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,579
<i>The excuse of killing dolphins</i>

253
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,790
<i>for the crime of eating too many fish
was a lie.</i>

254
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,418
<i>In reality,
what they were doing was killing dolphins</i>

255
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,170
<i>as a scapegoat for the overfishing.</i>

256
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,839
<i>That way,
they can continue participating</i>

257
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,091
<i>in the multibillion-dollar tuna industry,</i>

258
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,136
<i>and wash off
any ecological responsibility.</i>

259
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,764
<i>I learned one of
the world's largest tuna companies</i>

260
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>belonged to Mitsubishi,</i>

261
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,769
<i>who control 40%
of the world's endangered bluefin.</i>

262
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,687
<i>Since they were based in Japan,</i>

263
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,398
<i>we surprised them
by showing up at their head office.</i>

264
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,401
I was wondering
if we could do a quick interview.

265
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,988
We have questions about why your company
is wiping out an endangered species,

266
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,157
and how that's connected
to killing dolphins.

267
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,786
- Our company refused, so...
- Yeah.

268
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,663
Your company refuses all interviews?

269
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,039
Yes, all interviews.

270
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,834
<i>We're asked to turn our cameras off,
and leave immediately.</i>

271
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,420
<i>Back at the fishing port,</i>

272
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,716
<i>I noticed that tuna weren't the only
highly-prized species they were landing.</i>

273
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,847
<i>Sharks were everywhere,</i>

274
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,850
<i>and they were all having their fins
sliced off.</i>

275
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,855
Turn off the video!

276
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,067
Shut!

277
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,445
- Camera shut!
- Why don't you want me filming?

278
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,159
The shark-finning industry
is a multi-billion dollar industry

279
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,955
and is oftentimes
heavily criminally involved

280
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:40,082
and Mafia-esque run.

281
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,793
They don't want people
with cameras sniffing around

282
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,628
because they don't wanna get exposed

283
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,214
for all of the shady things that they do.

284
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,217
So sharks around the world
are being killed for their fins.

285
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,554
These fins are being shipped to Asia,
and predominantly China,

286
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,680
for shark fin soup,

287
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,390
which is held as a status symbol.

288
00:16:56,473 --> 00:17:00,019
It has no nutritional benefits,
it really doesn't taste like much,

289
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,855
and it can cost anywhere upwards
of $100 a bowl.

290
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,190
<i>Seeing so many sharks finned,</i>

291
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,901
<i>and being kicked out of the port
just for filming</i>,

292
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,403
<i>only made me want to learn more.</i>

293
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,948
<i>Since we had discovered all we could
about dolphin hunting in Taiji,</i>

294
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,702
<i>we decided to follow the shark story
to try and understand what impact</i>

295
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,121
<i>this industry was having
on the world's oceans.</i>

296
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,836
<i>Just a hop over the ocean from Japan
is Hong Kong,</i>

297
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,130
<i>otherwise known as Shark Fin City.</i>

298
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>We arrived to find streets
filled with shark fins,</i>

299
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,386
<i>and huge quantities being offloaded
from trucks on every corner.</i>

300
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,557
<i>We tried to film the fins up close,</i>

301
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,934
<i>but were met
with the same response as before.</i>

302
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,978
Go, go! No, no!

303
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,733
We can't film?

304
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,903
Are you gonna hit me with a chair?

305
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,155
All right, we're going.

306
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,241
- No photography?
- No.

307
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,368
- Why? Why you are filming?
- Huh?

308
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,953
Why you are taking the photo?

309
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,663
You didn't get any permission.

310
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,664
Delete the photo.

311
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,748
Delete first.

312
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,125
Hey, hey, hey!

313
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>Filming in Shark Fin City
was proving harder than we thought.</i>

314
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,551
<i>So in order to see these fins up close,
we got ourselves some spy cameras.</i>

315
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,560
Wow.

316
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,359
I used to be scared of sharks as a kid.

317
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,155
People should not be afraid
of having sharks in the ocean.

318
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,991
They should be afraid
of <i>not</i> having sharks in the ocean.

319
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,202
The sharks keep the oceans healthy.

320
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,247
They keep the fish stocks healthy.
They keep the ecosystems alive.

321
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,957
They keep the coral reefs alive.

322
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,542
If we don't have these sharks,

323
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,128
if these sharks
get finned into extinction,

324
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,796
the ocean's gonna turn into a swamp.

325
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,506
And guess who's gonna die next?

326
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:53,423
Us.

327
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,010
And a lot of people would think I'd
be the last person to stand up for sharks.

328
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,722
I was attacked by a shark
after serving 12 years in the military.

329
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,891
I was on a counter-terrorism exercise

330
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,269
in Sydney Harbor,
and a bull shark attacked me.

331
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,187
But knowledge dispels fear.

332
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,982
And through necessity,
I learned about the plight of sharks

333
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,068
through working
within the shark filming industry

334
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,236
over the last decade.

335
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,656
<i>It turned out sharks
were just as important</i>

336
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:18,907
<i>as dolphins and whales</i>

337
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,659
<i>in keeping the ocean alive.</i>

338
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,246
<i>But for the first time ever,</i>

339
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,541
<i>sharks were in danger of going extinct
because of us.</i>

340
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,171
<i>Like bluefin tuna,
shark populations were crashing,</i>

341
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,257
<i>with species like thresher, bull,
and hammerhead sharks</i>

342
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,011
<i>losing up to 80 to 99%
of their populations</i>

343
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,721
<i>in just the last few decades.</i>

344
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:44,474
<i>And it was causing other unlikely species
to die out with them.</i>

345
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,853
Over the period
that we've been monitoring seabirds,

346
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,938
since about 1950,

347
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,692
the abundance of seabirds
has declined by about 70%.

348
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,653
And if you look at how they feed,
you can understand why.

349
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,948
And what they do is
they kind of lightly dip down to the sea,

350
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,534
and they pick little fish off the surface.

351
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,536
And where seabirds are doing their best

352
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,122
is where predatory fish are driving shoals

353
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,167
of tiny bait fish to the surface,
where the terns can get them.

354
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,127
When you overfish the predators,

355
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,504
they no longer drive the shoals

356
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,965
to the surface,
so there's not enough food for the birds.

357
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,385
So the loss of fish
across the world's oceans is bringing us

358
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:25,682
into direct competition with whales,
dolphins, seabirds, for prey,

359
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,019
and that's causing their populations
to decline even further.

360
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,396
Sharks are apex predators.

361
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,815
So they're at the very, very top
of the food chain.

362
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,734
They are what I call level one.

363
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,819
They eat level two.

364
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,239
They eat the poor,
the sick, the weak of level two.

365
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,032
But when you take away level one,

366
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,701
level two then overpopulates.

367
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,703
And level two eats level three.

368
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,580
So they'll actually overpopulate.

369
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,959
They'll wipe out their food supply,
which is level three.

370
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,752
And then, level two's got nothing to eat.

371
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,213
So level two then disappears,
and they go extinct.

372
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,632
And it carries on down the food chain,

373
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,550
down to the smallest organisms.

374
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,804
So when we talk about saving sharks
and how important they are,

375
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,223
even though people
don't necessarily like them,

376
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,642
they are that key
to the survival of our oceans.

377
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,560
Around the world, on average,

378
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,355
sharks kill about ten people per year.

379
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,232
Now, comparatively speaking,

380
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:20,487
we kill 11,000 to 30,000 sharks per hour.

381
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,533
The crazy thing is,
almost half of those sharks killed

382
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,494
are killed as bycatch
from commercial fishing fleets.

383
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,789
And they're discarded as waste
back into the ocean.

384
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,166
<i>Bycatch was
all the other marine life</i>

385
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,585
<i>caught while trying to catch
a target species.</i>

386
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,171
<i>And I was shocked to learn
that every year,</i>

387
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,341
<i>at least 50 million sharks
are caught in nets this way,</i>

388
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,177
<i>side by side with our favorite seafood.</i>

389
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,932
<i>Studies estimate that up to 40%
of all marine life caught</i>

390
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,727
<i>gets thrown right back overboard
as bycatch,</i>

391
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,855
<i>and most of them die
before they even hit the water.</i>

392
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,776
So stopping shark fin soup
is only half the picture.

393
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,447
The problem is
that eating fish is just as bad,

394
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,158
if not worse
than the shark finning industry,

395
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,995
because the shark finning industry
is strictly held in Asia,

396
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,373
whereas everyone around the world
is eating fish.

397
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,085
I refer to bycatch
as the invisible victims

398
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,670
of the fishing industry.

399
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,381
The industry will call bycatch
"accidental take,"

400
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,259
but there's nothing accidental
about bycatch.

401
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,637
It's factored into the economics
of fishing.

402
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,350
In those fisheries where we have
a better understanding of bycatch,

403
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,727
the numbers can be alarming.

404
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,771
And so to give you one example,

405
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,690
in Iceland, in a one-month fishery,

406
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:42,319
that fishery caught
269 harbor porpoises,

407
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,572
something like 900 seals
of four different species,

408
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,949
and 5,000 seabirds.

409
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,953
And that's just one little fishery
in one little part of Iceland.

410
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,789
Taken across the world's oceans,

411
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,958
the amount of bycatch is huge.

412
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,546
<i>What made matters worse
was that this destructive fishery</i>

413
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,509
<i>had been awarded for its
sustainable fishing practices for years</i>

414
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:08,762
<i>by the very label I had trusted
whenever I bought seafood,</i>

415
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,472
<i>the MSC blue tick.</i>

416
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,768
<i>I contacted the charity who hand out
the labels about doing an interview,</i>

417
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,478
<i>but I received no reply.</i>

418
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,021
<i>In the meantime,</i>

419
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,525
<i>I discovered there were already over
a hundred different fishing regulations</i>

420
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,027
<i>on paper
for reducing this kind of bycatch.</i>

421
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,570
<i>The problem was,</i>

422
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,199
<i>with over four and a half million
commercial fishing vessels at sea,</i>

423
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,411
<i>it was a problem governments
had practically given up on enforcing.</i>

424
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,246
<i>Apparently, though,</i>

425
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,415
<i>there was one vigilante organization</i>

426
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,417
<i>who are filling this law enforcement void.</i>

427
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,586
<i>A volunteer-run group
who sail around the world</i>

428
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,671
<i>and into harm's way</i>

429
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:46,466
<i>in order to protect marine life
and bring ocean criminals to justice.</i>

430
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,177
<i>The marine conservation group
Sea Shepherd,</i>

431
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,806
<i>who have even sunk 13 whaling
and illegal fishing ships,</i>

432
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,643
<i>and rammed a further five,
all without harming a single person.</i>

433
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,063
<i>And by getting up close and personal</i>

434
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,107
<i>with the industries that are
destroying the ocean,</i>

435
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,943
<i>they have made some shocking discoveries.</i>

436
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,071
One of the recent discoveries
that Sea Shepherd has made

437
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,656
is that on the Atlantic French coast

438
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,994
up to 10,000 dolphins
are being killed every year by bycatch.

439
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,706
So this is ten times more
than dolphins being killed in Taiji,

440
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,999
and no one knew about it.

441
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,085
This has been going on
for at least 30 years

442
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,423
because the French government has been
very effective in hiding the problem.

443
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,966
People love dolphins,

444
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,219
and most of them have no idea
that when they eat fish,

445
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:35,223
they're actually putting a death sentence
on the dolphin population in France.

446
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,815
One of the most shocking things
that most people don't realize

447
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:48,320
is that the greatest threat to whales
and dolphins is commercial fishing.

448
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,615
Over 300,000 whales and dolphins
are killed every single year

449
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,159
as bycatch of industrial fishing.

450
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:58,497
Well, what about sustainable labels,
things like Dolphin Safe tuna?

451
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,375
For those of us who spend as much time
at sea as I do,

452
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:07,047
uh, we realized that labels often obscure
what's really happening at sea.

453
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,551
We caught tuna fishing vessels
who had slaughtered 45 dolphins

454
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,094
to catch eight tunas.

455
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:18,642
And that fishing vessel was
working for Dolphin Safe canned tuna.

456
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,938
<i>I had learned
some shocking things so far,</i>

457
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,315
<i>but this was just unbelievable.</i>

458
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,192
<i>I couldn't verify these numbers online,</i>

459
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,194
<i>and I was skeptical
to Sea Shepherd's claim</i>

460
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,612
<i>against the organization.</i>

461
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,533
<i>To find out for sure, I decided to meet
with the organization behind the label,</i>

462
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,326
<i>the Earth Island Institute.</i>

463
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,371
What's the maximum number of dolphins
that can be killed in a net

464
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,957
before the tuna is no longer Dolphin Safe?

465
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,167
Zero. One.

466
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,380
So, one dolphin and, you know, you're out.

467
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,175
So can you guarantee
that every can is dolphin-safe?

468
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,343
Nope. Hm-mm.

469
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,344
Nobody can.

470
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,847
Once you're out there in the ocean,
how do you know what they're doing?

471
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,684
Uh, we have observers on board.

472
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,644
Uh, the observers can be bribed.

473
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,356
Wait, um...
Are your observers out at sea often?

474
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,817
On a regular basis, no. Mm-mm.

475
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,654
There's nobody out there witnessing
whether they kill dolphins or not.

476
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,739
So how do you know it's dolphin-safe,

477
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:19,202
especially when they're paying you
to license your Dolphin Safe label?

478
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,163
What they're doing
is taking the captain's word for it.

479
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,166
They look at the captain's log.
He says, "I didn't kill any dolphins."

480
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,835
"Oh, okay. Here's your label."

481
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,545
"That'll cost you blah-blah-blah."

482
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,006
So just...
just so I get my head around this,

483
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,592
um, you have observers,
but they're rarely there,

484
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,843
and they can be bribed.

485
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,887
And so you can't guarantee
that Dolphin Safe tuna is dolphin-safe?

486
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:42,142
That's certainly true
in terms of, uh, how the system works.

487
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,437
So, what are people meant to do now
if they want to protect dolphins?

488
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,772
What we tell them is
to buy Dolphin Safe tuna,

489
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,191
tuna that's verified
by Earth Island Institute

490
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,526
to be dolphin-safe.

491
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,862
But it's not guaranteed
to be dolphin-safe.

492
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,989
Uh, nothing can guarantee
it's dolphin-safe.

493
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,950
Um, but if it's not guaranteed
to be dolphin-safe,

494
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,702
why is it called Dolphin Safe?

495
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,371
We can pretty well guarantee
it's dolphin-safe, yeah.

496
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,707
But you just told me
it's not guaranteed.

497
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,418
It's not guaranteed
in the same way that, uh...

498
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,173
The world is a difficult place sometimes.

499
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,801
Conflict of interest?

500
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,180
Yeah, I think it's a conflict of interest.
I also think it's fraud.

501
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:23,642
So, I was working for them,
and I walked away from that.

502
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,810
I was making more than $100,000 a year.

503
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,772
Free life insurance.
Something I can't even buy.

504
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,483
I left that because of their phony...

505
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,820
Dolphin Safe tuna label.
I don't wanna be associated with that.

506
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,114
<i>I couldn't believe
what I was hearing.</i>

507
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,617
<i>The internationally recognized
seafood label</i>

508
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,287
<i>was a complete fabrication
since it guaranteed nothing.</i>

509
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,999
<i>At this point, I began to wonder
what else was being covered up.</i>

510
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,711
Even the groups
that are talking about marine plastic

511
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:55,173
are highly reluctant to talk about
what a lot of that plastic is,

512
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,259
which is fishing nets and fishing gear.

513
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,762
We hear a lot
about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,

514
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,599
and say, "Oh, isn't it terrible?
All our cotton buds and plastic bags

515
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,644
are swirling around
in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch."

516
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,063
Forty-six percent of it is fishing nets,

517
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,149
discarded fishing nets,
which are far more dangerous

518
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,944
for marine life than our plastic straws.

519
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,446
Because, of course,
they're designed to kill.

520
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,368
Now, this is so crashingly obvious,
why aren't we talking about it?

521
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:28,081
Why aren't even the plastics campaigns
talking about fishing?

522
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,168
<i>How had I not
heard about this before?</i>

523
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,213
<i>Fishing vessels discard
a massive amount of ropes and lines,</i>

524
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,798
<i>and this was a major problem.</i>

525
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:41,428
<i>Today, even some of the most remote places
on Earth were awash with fishing gear.</i>

526
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,014
<i>Like Henderson Island
in the Pacific Ocean,</i>

527
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,935
<i>and Svalbard in the Arctic Circle.</i>

528
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,231
<i>In fact, looking closer at some of
the whales that washed up in the UK</i>

529
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,482
<i>when my journey began,</i>

530
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,694
<i>I discovered fishing gear
was the main trash in their stomachs.</i>

531
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,657
<i>This was the whale in the room
that no one was talking about.</i>

532
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,744
<i>I even found that longline fishing</i>

533
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,080
<i>sets enough fishing lines
to wrap around the entire planet</i>

534
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,333
<i>500 times every single day.</i>

535
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,379
Although there isn't
a single fishery in the world

536
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,506
that deliberately targets sea turtles,

537
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,219
six out of seven species of sea turtle
are either threatened or endangered.

538
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,598
Not because of climate change,
not because of ocean pollution,

539
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,684
not because of plastics in the ocean,
but because of fishing.

540
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,187
But this is an issue
that nobody wants to talk about.

541
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,982
<i>Again, if this was true,
how come I'd never heard about it?</i>

542
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:39,402
<i>All the headlines I'd ever seen
focused on plastic straws.</i>

543
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,696
<i>So I decided to look into the research.</i>

544
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,533
<i>A global study estimated
a conservative 1,000 sea turtle deaths</i>

545
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,243
<i>from plastic per year.</i>

546
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,121
<i>However, in the United States alone,</i>

547
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:54,334
<i>250,000 sea turtles are captured, injured,</i>

548
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,712
<i>or killed every year by fishing vessels.</i>

549
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,965
<i>If a single sea turtle
with a straw in its nose went viral,</i>

550
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,301
<i>then why wasn't this front page news?</i>

551
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,930
<i>When I went on the websites
of leading marine organizations</i>

552
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,640
<i>who tackle plastic pollution,</i>

553
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,601
<i>I found pages and pages encouraging people</i>

554
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,020
<i>to stop using everything from tea bags</i>

555
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,146
<i>to chewing gum.</i>

556
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,940
<i>But no mention whatsoever</i>

557
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,775
<i>of what to do about fishing gear,</i>

558
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,860
<i>that is if they even mentioned it.</i>

559
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:24,322
<i>Instead, plastic straws
seemed to take up 99%</i>

560
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,742
<i>of what these groups were talking about,
which became even more shocking</i>

561
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,914
<i>when I found out plastic straws
only accounted for 0.03%</i>

562
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,083
<i>of plastic entering the ocean.</i>

563
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,295
<i>This was like trying to save
the Amazon rain forest and stop logging</i>

564
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,422
<i>by boycotting toothpicks.</i>

565
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,258
<i>It was barely a drop in the ocean.</i>

566
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,343
<i>If fishing gear was such a huge problem,</i>

567
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,179
<i>I wanted to know why
my favorite plastic organization</i>

568
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,389
<i>wasn't talking about it.</i>

569
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,350
So, according to
the Plastic Pollution Coalition,

570
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,645
what is the main source of plastic
in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch?

571
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,813
Microplastics.

572
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,733
Uh, for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,
I'm mostly finding microplastics.

573
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,610
Well, the latest study
actually showed

574
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,988
that 46%
of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

575
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,739
is fishing nets alone,

576
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,159
and the majority of the other garbage
were other types of fishing gear.

577
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,579
So wouldn't that be the majority?

578
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,914
No, I wouldn't say...
I won't say the majority

579
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,458
of the plastic in the jar is fishing nets.

580
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,919
Um, it's... it's a lot.
It's a... it's a mix of things.

581
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,046
But a majority means over 50%,

582
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,673
and fishing-related garbage

583
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,717
in the patch is over 50%.

584
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,969
So wouldn't that make it the majority?

585
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,512
Yeah. So if the... if the...

586
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,390
If it's close to 50%, that's, um, uh...

587
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,559
Yes, plastic fishing nets.

588
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,854
There is nothing that would compare
to that ratio as far as one item,

589
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,771
you know.

590
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,816
Uh, but the overwhelming, uh, thing is

591
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,861
that it's... it's plastic fishing nets.

592
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,656
Is there something that people
can do to stop this fishing net trash?

593
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,578
Uh, one thing that you could do
is... is, uh, eliminate,

594
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,582
or really, really reduce
your intake of... of fish,

595
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,627
and to really let those...
those populations rebound.

596
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,339
But also, that will eliminate
as much materials being used

597
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,506
to... to get those fish.

598
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,841
Well, do you know why

599
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,385
this important message
isn't on your website?

600
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,138
I... I don't... I don't know.
I don't make the website.

601
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,474
I mean, it'd be great for you
to talk to Dianna about it.

602
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,893
She's the founder,
she's been in it, she's got the...

603
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,770
She could probably
give you better answers.

604
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,401
So, Jackie was saying
that one of the ways

605
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,443
to tackle the massive problem
of fishing nets in the ocean

606
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,445
is to say no to eating fish.

607
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:31,282
I was wondering why you haven't put
that important message on your website.

608
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,535
A consumer message to eat less fish?

609
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,663
Yeah, it's not my area.

610
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,207
- It's not my area of focus. I hear you.
- Yeah.

611
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,084
I don't have time. We have an event.

612
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,252
Can you turn off the cameras? Thanks.

613
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,137
I'm not interested
in focusing there.

614
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,466
I don't have an opinion about that.

615
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,844
I was talking about
what people can do to make a difference

616
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,638
about fishing net trash in the ocean,

617
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,224
and Jackie said to eliminate
or reduce fish consumption.

618
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,977
- I asked if that was...
- She didn't say eliminate fish.

619
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,788
- She did.
- I know she didn't.

620
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:05,608
...is, uh, eliminate or really,
really reduce your intake of... of fish.

621
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,695
- She did. She...
- She didn't say eliminate fish.

622
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,738
<i>I had no idea what was going on.</i>

623
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,615
<i>Why was such a simple question</i>

624
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,575
<i>receiving such backlash?</i>

625
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,828
<i>My only option was to follow the money.</i>

626
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,371
<i>So I did.</i>

627
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,541
<i>And sure enough, there it was.</i>

628
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,045
Of course they're not gonna
talk about fishing nets.

629
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,006
The Plastic Pollution Coalition

630
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,467
is the same organization
as the Earth Island Institute.

631
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,595
These are the same ones who are
behind the Dolphin Safe tuna label,

632
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,432
who work with the fishing industry
to sell more seafood.

633
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,601
No wonder why they don't talk about
the leading cause of plastic pollution

634
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,061
in many parts of the world.

635
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,398
Now, it's entirely right to say

636
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,525
that we must use far less plastic.

637
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:53,072
But even if not a single gram of plastic
entered the oceans

638
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,949
from today onwards,

639
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,244
we would still be ripping
those ecosystems apart

640
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:01,831
because the biggest issue by far
is commercial fishing.

641
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,208
It's not just far more damaging

642
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,835
than plastic pollution,

643
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:09,130
it's far more damaging than oil pollution
from oil spills.

644
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,633
The Deepwater Horizon oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico

645
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,177
was the biggest in history.

646
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,679
It gushed huge quantities of oil

647
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,307
into the deep sea for a period of months.

648
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:23,102
And everyone was appalled
at the death of wildlife on the beaches

649
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,771
as the oil slopped ashore.

650
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,857
But in fact,
the fishing industry in the Gulf of Mexico

651
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,319
destroyed more animals in a day

652
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,322
than that oil spill did in months.

653
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,533
Because large areas were closed to fishing

654
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,411
because of the possibility
of being tainted by oil,

655
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,288
marine life actually benefited

656
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,665
from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill

657
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,001
because it got a respite from fishing.

658
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,297
I have a hard time accepting that
a fisherman on his little fishing boat

659
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,216
- could be causing all this damage.
- Yeah.

660
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,884
So, what's the deal?

661
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,386
There's this image
of the fishing industry,

662
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,473
which is deeply implanted in our minds
from childhood.

663
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,891
It's a little red boat

664
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:04,102
chugging across a sparkling sea

665
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,229
with Captain Birdseye at the wheel,

666
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,648
with his white beard,
and his twinkly blue eyes,

667
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,024
and his fisherman's cap.

668
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:14,070
And of course, what it really is,
is a death machine.

669
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:19,242
This is a highly effective,
technological machine.

670
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:23,830
You've got these massively powerful boats,
huge fishing ships,

671
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:27,166
whose purpose is to mop up the animals

672
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,045
which are at the basis
of the whole marine food chain,

673
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,129
the fish.

674
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,425
<i>Although I finally felt like I was
on the right track,</i>

675
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,302
<i>I couldn't help but feel frustrated</i>

676
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,346
<i>that the constant media
and global attention</i>

677
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,098
<i>on plastics and fossil fuels</i>

678
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,309
<i>were distracting from an industry
we hear almost nothing about,</i>

679
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,812
<i>with a much, much greater impact
on the sea.</i>

680
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,980
<i>Digging deeper,</i>

681
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,441
<i>I discovered this was also true
when it came to coral reefs.</i>

682
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:56,529
<i>With scientists predicting the loss
of 90% of reefs by the year 2050,</i>

683
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,949
<i>the only mainstream narrative on why
reefs were dying was climate change.</i>

684
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:03,619
<i>But hardly anyone was talking about
the fact fish were vital</i>

685
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,204
<i>to keep corals alive.</i>

686
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:11,043
The ecosystem on coral reefs
is heavily based on recycling.

687
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,463
When these animals excrete,
that is food for the corals.

688
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,926
As fishermen come in and catch the fish,
not only is the fish suffering,

689
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,306
but the products that the fish release
into the water is food for the corals,

690
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:27,435
and the nutrients to replace them
and grow them up again will be lost.

691
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:31,772
<i>Fishing has become the major threat
on many reefs around the world.</i>

692
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,941
<i>From the Middle East to the Caribbean,</i>

693
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,778
<i>where 90% of the large fish
which prospered there for millennia</i>

694
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,238
<i>have now disappeared.</i>

695
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,909
<i>So our oceans were clearly
at a turning point,</i>

696
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,369
<i>and I needed definitive answers.</i>

697
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,246
<i>I wanted to speak to conservationists</i>

698
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,370
<i>who had spent their lives
trying to protect the sea,</i>

699
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,417
<i>starting with meeting a living legend,</i>

700
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,295
<i>and one of my all-time favorite heroes,
to tell me more.</i>

701
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,339
I'm Sylvia Earle, an oceanographer,

702
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,008
explorer-in-residence
at the National Geographic,

703
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,218
founder of Mission Blue,

704
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,971
founder of Deep Ocean Exploration
and Research.

705
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,390
So over the years, I've seen changes.

706
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,475
I've been a witness

707
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:11,896
to perhaps the greatest era
of discovery about the ocean.

708
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,941
But at the same time,
the greatest era of loss.

709
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,151
Since the middle of the 20th century,

710
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:20,738
humans have succeeded
in extracting from the ocean,

711
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,949
immense quantities of wildlife.

712
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,993
The estimate is by the middle
of the 21st century,

713
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,330
if we keep taking wild fish at the level
that we are today,

714
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,998
there'll be no commercial fishing,

715
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,834
because there won't be
enough fish tocatch.

716
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,504
In the middle of the North Sea
in the 1830s,

717
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,923
a typical fishing boat
would be able to catch

718
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,759
one or two tons of halibut every day.

719
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,387
But today, the entire fishing fleet there

720
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,765
catches about two tons of halibut
across the entire year,

721
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,559
which means that halibut
is more than a thousand times

722
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,645
less abundant today than it was then.

723
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,064
We are at war with the oceans.

724
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,109
And if we win this war,
we're going to lose it all,

725
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,737
because mankind is not able
to live on this planet with a dead sea.

726
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:06,701
It's the total industrialization
of fishing that is the problem here.

727
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,328
We are pretty much destroying everything
at rapid speed.

728
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,540
<i>Commercial fishing was essentially</i>

729
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,167
<i>wildlife poaching on a mass scale,</i>

730
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:19,422
<i>catching up to 2.7 trillion fish
every year,</i>

731
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,134
<i>or up to five million
killed every single minute.</i>

732
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,429
<i>No other industry on Earth</i>

733
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,098
<i>killed anywhere near
as many animals as this trade,</i>

734
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,226
<i>let alone wild species
that we barely understand.</i>

735
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,437
<i>This has led to global fish populations,</i>

736
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,189
<i>in some cases,
plummeting to near extinction.</i>

737
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,193
<i>But perhaps one of the
most shocking facts of all</i>

738
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,194
<i>came from one of the world's
leading fisheries experts</i>

739
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,323
<i>estimating that if
current fishing trends continue,</i>

740
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,867
<i>we will see virtually empty oceans</i>

741
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,119
<i>by the year 2048.</i>

742
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,501
<i>The more I learned,
the more devastating this fact became,</i>

743
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,837
<i>as I began to understand
just how interconnected</i>

744
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,839
<i>each species were with each other</i>,

745
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,967
<i>and even the role they play
in maintaining the chemistry of the ocean</i>

746
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,428
<i>and our planet's atmosphere.</i>

747
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,222
It sounds just mind-blowing,

748
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,517
but the power
of animals moving up and down

749
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,021
through the water column,
in terms of mixing,

750
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:21,025
is as great as all the wind, waves,

751
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,403
tides, and currents in the seas combined.

752
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,656
And this has a huge impact

753
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,244
on the, the physics, the chemistry,
and the biology of the seas.

754
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,288
<i>All this churning of the sea</i>

755
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,875
<i>may be one of the ways the oceans
help absorb heat from the atmosphere.</i>

756
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,169
<i>As animals swim through the water column,</i>

757
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,339
<i>it creates a powerful down-welling
of the warmer surface waters</i>

758
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,216
<i>to mix with the colder waters below.</i>

759
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,301
<i>And although more research
needs to be done,</i>

760
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,888
<i>the decimation of marine life
may be interfering with this process,</i>

761
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,349
<i>and contributing
to warmer sea temperatures.</i>

762
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,060
<i>The bottom line,
the oceans and the life within it</i>

763
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,146
<i>play a much bigger role
in climate than we ever expected.</i>

764
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,650
And it turns out
that the life in the oceans

765
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,237
is absolutely crucial
for holding on to carbon

766
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,990
and preventing it
from being released to the atmosphere.

767
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,494
We understand that leaving trees
or planting trees

768
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,746
really helps the carbon equation,

769
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,248
but nothing matters more

770
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:20,960
than maintaining the integrity
of ocean systems.

771
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,670
I mean, these big animals,

772
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,088
even the little ones,

773
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,798
they take up carbon.

774
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,176
They sequester carbon
when they sink to the bottom of the ocean.

775
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,887
The ocean is the biggest carbon sink
on the planet.

776
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,351
If you want to address climate change,
the first thing you do

777
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,103
is protect the ocean.

778
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,022
And the solution to that is very simple:
leave it alone.

779
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,442
I always equate it to
this being a spaceship.

780
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,236
The Earth is a spaceship.
It's on a trip around the galaxy.

781
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,572
It takes 250 million years
just to make one orbit.

782
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,491
And every spaceship
has a life-support system,

783
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,702
provides us with the food we eat,
the air we breathe,

784
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,745
and regulates the climate,
the temperatures.

785
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,374
That life support system is run by a crew
of earthlings,

786
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,501
and there's only so many crew members
you can kill

787
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,629
before the machinery begins to break down,
you run out of engineers.

788
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,215
And that's what's happening,
we're killing off the crew.

789
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,517
<i>I discovered that one of
the most important crew members</i>

790
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,019
<i>on this spaceship Earth</i>

791
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:22,146
<i>were actually marine plants.</i>

792
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,523
<i>Per acre, these coastal plants can store</i>

793
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,194
<i>up to 20 times more carbon
than forests on land.</i>

794
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,781
<i>In fact, 93% of all the world's CO2
is stored in the ocean</i>

795
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,910
<i>with the help of marine vegetation,
algae, and coral.</i>

796
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,579
<i>And losing just 1% of this ecosystem</i>

797
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:42,875
<i>was equivalent to releasing
the emissions of 97 million cars.</i>

798
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,962
By, uh, continued extraction
of fish out of our oceans,

799
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:48,964
you're essentially deforesting our oceans

800
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,133
by not only removing the fish,

801
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,593
but the act of removal,

802
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:56,472
the methods of removal
are devastating to habitat, to ecosystems.

803
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,975
And it's even more so there
because it's out of sight, out of mind.

804
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,854
<i>Trawling was by far
the most destructive form of fishing.</i>

805
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,981
<i>The largest trawl nets are so big</i>

806
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,691
<i>they could swallow whole cathedrals</i>

807
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,236
<i>or up to 13 jumbo jet planes.</i>

808
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,321
<i>The nets drag heavy weights at the bottom,</i>

809
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,199
<i>scarring the sea floor
that were once abundant with life</i>,

810
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,952
<i>leaving nothing
but a barren wasteland behind.</i>

811
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,830
<i>This was just like bulldozing
pristine Amazonian rain forest,</i>

812
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,291
<i>except it was much, much worse.</i>

813
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,796
<i>Every year, approximately 25 million
acres of forest are lost.</i>

814
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,633
<i>This was equivalent to losing
about 27 soccer fields per minute.</i>

815
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,760
<i>However, bottom trawling wipes out</i>

816
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:39,223
<i>an estimated 3.9 billion acres every year.</i>

817
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:46,355
<i>This was equivalent to losing
4,316 soccer fields every single minute.</i>

818
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,107
<i>Tallied up across the year,</i>

819
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,651
<i>this was equivalent
to wiping out the land area</i>

820
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,571
<i>of Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Finland,</i>

821
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,157
<i>Denmark, the UK, Germany, France, Spain,</i>

822
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,995
<i>Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Iran, Thailand,</i>

823
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,539
<i>and Australia combined.</i>

824
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,208
Where are the big environment groups?

825
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,586
Why aren't they all over this like a rash?

826
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,920
It's so obvious.

827
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,672
It's just shouting in our faces.

828
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,175
It is the fishing industry
that is destroying the fish

829
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,303
and the rest of the life of the seas.

830
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,306
How much more obvious does it need to be?

831
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,100
And yet, for the most part,
they are silent.

832
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,477
They're not speaking out against it.

833
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,023
They are deliberately not engaging

834
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,650
with the most important issue of all.

835
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,444
Many, uh, researchers feel

836
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,488
that we should be at about 30%
of our oceans being protected.

837
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:41,160
But, in reality, we're at 5% now
of marine protected areas.

838
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,412
But that's misleading because over 90%

839
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,998
of those marine protected areas
still allow fishing.

840
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,249
So in reality,

841
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,877
less than 1% of all of our oceans
are being regulated.

842
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,462
We hear a lot from governments

843
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,297
about these marine protected areas.

844
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,425
And one of the government ministers
was interviewed and asked,

845
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,260
"In this particular protected area,

846
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,096
what is the additional protection
you're actually giving it?"

847
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,300
"Are you gonna protect it
against industrial fishing?"

848
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,266
"No."

849
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,230
"Are you gonna protect it
against oil drilling?"

850
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,102
"No."

851
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,271
"So, what are you actually
protecting it against?"

852
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,774
"Well, we're going
to put some more restrictions

853
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,983
on sea kayaking."

854
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,068
Seriously?

855
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,027
Kayaking?

856
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,821
This was the only thing
she could come up with?

857
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,823
It's an utter disgrace.

858
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,911
<i>With virtually no marine protected
areas that didn't allow fishing,</i>

859
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,830
<i>and global fish populations
on the brink of collapse,</i>

860
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,290
<i>I began to question</i>

861
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,085
<i>whether sustainable seafood
could even exist.</i>

862
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,004
I have looked long and hard,

863
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,548
seriously, at trying to find an example

864
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:41,512
of where a large-scale extraction
of wildlife is sustainable.

865
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,267
It just doesn't exist.

866
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,144
It's hard to say,

867
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,355
"In some areas, fishing is okay,

868
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,648
and in others, it's not."

869
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,192
Because who will draw the line?

870
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:59,488
How would you know if a fish is,
like, caught illegal,

871
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:04,159
or is coming out of
a sustainable fishing method?

872
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,662
Well, first of all, there's no such thing.
It's impossible.

873
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,831
There's no such thing
as a sustainable fishery.

874
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,749
There's not enough fish to justify that.

875
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,459
Everything is now sustainable.

876
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,878
It's not sustainable.
Just a marketing phrase, that's all.

877
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,464
So don't you agree
with organizations

878
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,842
that recommend people
eat more sustainable seafood

879
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,343
as a way to protect the ocean?

880
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,303
No, I disagree with it completely.

881
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,472
You know,
basically what they're trying to do

882
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,891
is to appeal to the big tent.

883
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,018
They want the people who eat fish
to support them.

884
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,272
And this was a problem when I was
National Director for the Sierra Club,

885
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,523
that was their problem.

886
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:37,025
They didn't wanna come out
against hunting, against fishing,

887
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,360
or against meat-eating.

888
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:42,281
Because they thought they would
lose membership support if they did.

889
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,075
A lot of these groups aren't interested
in solving the problem,

890
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,453
they're interested
in exploiting the problem.

891
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,873
There's a lot of groups out there,
climate change, conservation, whatever.

892
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,917
It's a business.
It's a feel-good business.

893
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,753
<i>I looked on Oceana's website.</i>

894
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,380
<i>They were the world's largest
marine conservation group,</i>

895
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,174
<i>but there wasn't a single mention</i>

896
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,634
<i>of reducing or eliminating
seafood consumption.</i>

897
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,970
<i>Instead, the organization recommends</i>

898
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,139
<i>one of the best ways to save fish</i>

899
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,557
<i>was to eat fish.</i>

900
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,351
<i>Oceana were advocating
for sustainable fishing,</i>

901
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,396
<i>so I decided to meet with the group
so they could explain what that meant.</i>

902
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,733
What does sustainable fishing
actually mean? Who defines it?

903
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,027
That's a really thoughtful question.

904
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,361
Uh, sustainable...

905
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,739
Sustainability is not defined as such.

906
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:27,034
There is not a definition
of sustainability,

907
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,077
as a whole, for fisheries.

908
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,288
Isn't it confusing, then, to say,

909
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,790
"Eat sustainable fish,"

910
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,792
if there's no universal definition for it?

911
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,293
Uh, absolutely.

912
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,254
No, the consumer can't
assess right now, uh, properly

913
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,173
what fish is sustainable, what is not.

914
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,342
Uh, there is full of advices,

915
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:47,095
but it's true that the consumer can't
make an informed decision right now.

916
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,056
So if no one really knows
what it means,

917
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,141
wouldn't a more effective strategy be

918
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,102
to, say, reduce or eliminate
seafood consumption?

919
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,355
Wouldn't that be the best for the ocean?

920
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,066
That's...

921
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,568
I mean, it's difficult
to answer a question

922
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,571
with such a deep reflection

923
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,907
with, uh, so little time
to think about, right?

924
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,118
Um, because we don't have a position
in that respect.

925
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,954
We're never asked that question.

926
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,789
Oh, it would just be on the website.

927
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,876
You know, "Number one thing you can do
for the ocean, reduce fish consumption."

928
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,795
- Something like that.
- Um...

929
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:24,174
<i>I left the Oceana office with less
faith in the group than when I walked in.</i>

930
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,302
<i>Disappointed that they were unable
to answer such a simple question</i>

931
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,720
<i>about sustainable fishing.</i>

932
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,848
<i>Perhaps contacting
governmental authorities</i>

933
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,211
<i>would better answer my question.</i>

934
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:36,144
<i>After all, it was the second-best
thing to do on Oceana's website.</i>

935
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,855
<i>So I went straight to the top</i>

936
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,606
<i>and managed to secure a rare meeting</i>

937
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,210
<i>with the European Commissioner
of Fisheries and the Environment,</i>

938
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,237
<i>who was recently passing laws
to ban single-use plastic.</i>

939
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,323
What is the definition
of sustainable fishing?

940
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,285
Imagine that you have money in a bank,

941
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:55,706
you have capital, you put, I don't know,
€100 in the bank.

942
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,292
That €100, which is the capital,

943
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,252
is giving you interest.

944
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:04,214
As long as you are taking the interest,
and spending the interest

945
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,633
without touching the capital,

946
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,261
then that is sustainability.

947
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,681
As soon as you start taking away
the capital as well,

948
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,976
then you've entered
the unsustainable cycle.

949
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,437
Well, using your economic analogy,

950
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,940
today's oceans aren't only in debt,
but they're in a major depression.

951
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,651
Shouldn't we just stop spending
what we can't afford?

952
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,363
Obviously, we cannot go
to the other extreme, and say,

953
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,700
"The only solution is not to fish at all."

954
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,952
We cannot... I don't think we can do that.

955
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,663
But your government
are taking extreme measures

956
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,582
to ban single-use plastic,

957
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,376
when fishing causes far more destruction.

958
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,546
So why is the fishing industry
getting special treatment from this?

959
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,966
Yes. For me,
the idea is not to stop fishing.

960
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,512
For me, the idea is
to do more sustainable fishing.

961
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,806
To do more sustainable fishing.

962
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,433
<i>More sustainable fishing</i>

963
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,727
<i>meant doing more of something
that isn't working,</i>

964
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,520
<i>and can't even be defined.</i>

965
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,065
<i>I wondered though,
with no clear definition,</i>

966
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,944
<i>where did that leave sustainable
certification groups, like the MSC,</i>

967
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,029
<i>who still haven't got back to me?</i>

968
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,198
Oh, you mean
the Marine Stewardship Council?

969
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,075
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

970
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,998
Getting me onto the subject of the
Marine Stewardship Council, you know.

971
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,036
Uh...

972
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,625
How much do I want to say?

973
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,627
Well, they have certified fisheries

974
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,630
that produce astonishing levels
of bycatch.

975
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:29,007
And those are ignored
because the level of kill

976
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,802
is considered to be "sustainable"
in itself.

977
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:34,179
But that's not what a consumer
is looking for.

978
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,974
They want to know that
no marine mammals are being killed,

979
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,600
no seabirds are being slaughtered,

980
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,061
in order to put that fish on their plate.

981
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:45,190
The label on the tin
isn't worth a damn in some cases.

982
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,819
They make it appear on paper
as if, uh, eating,

983
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,780
on one hand, uh,
sustainably-produced salmon

984
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,199
is, uh, better than killing
a bluefin tuna,

985
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,077
and therefore creates a justification
in the eyes of the consumer.

986
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,080
But that's like essentially saying
that it's more sustainable

987
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,249
to shoot a polar bear
than shooting a panda.

988
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,375
When in reality,

989
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,086
uh, neither one is sustainable,
and neither one is right to do.

990
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,921
So, do you think it's gonna be possible

991
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,465
to do an interview with the MSC
at any point?

992
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,777
<i>Um, I don't think that's gonna work out.</i>

993
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,053
<i>Um, there's nobody in the office
at the moment.</i>

994
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,596
<i>There's loads of conferences on.</i>

995
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,267
<i>After having our interview request
turned down countless times over phone,</i>

996
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,686
<i>we decided to visit
their head office instead.</i>

997
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,312
Hi, my name's Ali.

998
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,524
I've been trying to organize an interview
with someone at MSC for months now,

999
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,110
and I just had some questions
about sustainable fishing.

1000
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,071
Would there be anyone around
I could speak to really quickly?

1001
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:36,783
<i>We were told to wait in the waiting room
while they found someone to speak to us.</i>

1002
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,911
<i>But after half an hour of panicked looks
between the members of staff,</i>

1003
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,204
<i>we were asked to leave.</i>

1004
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:46,251
Just got palmed off again by the MSC.

1005
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,004
The world's largest
sustainable seafood organization

1006
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,798
doesn't wanna talk to me
about sustainable seafood.

1007
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,970
<i>The only thing left to do
was to try and follow the money.</i>

1008
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,474
<i>And it didn't take long
to find the massive conflict of interest.</i>

1009
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,142
<i>One of the founders of the MSC</i>

1010
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,894
<i>was the Unilever corporation,</i>

1011
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,188
<i>who at the time
were a major seafood retailer.</i>

1012
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:10,317
<i>And despite countless fisheries
clearly being depleted and destructive</i>,

1013
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,735
<i>I could only find a couple</i>

1014
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,780
<i>that had ever been denied certification
in over 20 years.</i>

1015
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,531
<i>But most shocking of all</i>

1016
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:21,536
<i>was learning that over 80%
of the almost £30-million-a-year income</i>

1017
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,081
<i>was from licensing their logo on seafood.</i>

1018
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:27,542
<i>Basically, the more blue ticks they
handed out, the more money they made.</i>

1019
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,294
<i>So as far as I was concerned,</i>

1020
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,963
<i>there was no way I was gonna
trust these labels again.</i>

1021
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:36,426
<i>In fact, other attempts to
regulate the industry were also failing,</i>

1022
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,844
<i>with government observers</i>

1023
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,889
<i>who are given the task
of monitoring fishing activity on ships</i>

1024
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:44,267
<i>being murdered at sea,
thrown overboard,</i>

1025
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:48,021
<i>like Keith Davis,
a 41-year-old American observer,</i>

1026
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,982
<i>who in recent years
went missing off the coast of Peru,</i>

1027
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,526
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

1028
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,027
<i>In Papua New Guinea,</i>

1029
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:57,197
<i>18 observers went missing
in the space of just five years.</i>

1030
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,991
<i>And in the Philippines, in 2015,</i>

1031
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:02,702
<i>an observer by the name
of Ms. Gerlie Alpajora</i>

1032
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,247
<i>received death threats
from the family of a tuna fisherman</i>

1033
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,957
<i>who was arrested for illegal fishing.</i>

1034
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,502
<i>Soon after, armed men entered her home,</i>

1035
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:14,047
<i>and she was assassinated in cold blood
with a gunshot to the head</i>

1036
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,633
<i>in front of her two young boys.</i>

1037
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,386
When we look at fisheries crime,

1038
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,932
we have to look at it within the context
of transnational organized crime.

1039
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:27,018
And the same syndicates
that are behind illegal fishing

1040
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:30,897
are the same criminal groups
that are behind drug trafficking,

1041
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,191
human trafficking, and other crimes.

1042
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:37,571
If you get in the way of their business,
you are risking your own life.

1043
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:41,158
But also don't be surprised at the extent
at which governments will go

1044
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,160
to prevent you from exposing

1045
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:46,913
the economic activities
that they subsidize at sea.

1046
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,750
<i>A subsidy is taxpayer money
given to an industry</i>

1047
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,920
<i>to keep the price of a product or service
artificially low.</i>

1048
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,881
<i>And in an increasing number of countries,</i>

1049
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,426
<i>more money was going out
than the value of fish coming back in.</i>

1050
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,761
So if you don't eat fish,

1051
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,014
you're still sustaining fisheries

1052
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,433
because you're paying for it
in your taxes.

1053
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,186
So if you think about it,
it's really shocking

1054
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,646
that we subsidize the fishing industry

1055
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:15,525
somewhere in the region of $35 billion,

1056
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,612
which is the same amount that,
according to United Nations,

1057
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,947
we'd need to combat world hunger.

1058
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:26,453
<i>Subsidies were originally started
as a means to ensure food security.</i>

1059
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,621
<i>But ironically,</i>

1060
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,207
<i>they are now the cause of food insecurity</i>

1061
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,917
<i>in many developing regions.</i>

1062
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,545
Fishing by the
European Union in places like West Africa

1063
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,924
is driven by European Union subsidies.

1064
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,885
And that means
that local businesses can't compete

1065
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:45,347
with the economic might
of the European Union.

1066
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,599
Really it's just a continuation

1067
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,186
of a history
of plundering the African continent.

1068
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,191
<i>These intensive fishing operations
weren't only wiping out the fish,</i>

1069
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,818
<i>they were also destroying economies.</i>

1070
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,362
<i>In the United States,</i>

1071
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,782
<i>up to one in every three
wild-caught fish imported</i>

1072
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,285
<i>had been caught illegally,
and therefore sold illegally.</i>

1073
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,247
<i>Stolen, often from countries in most need,</i>

1074
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,207
<i>where there are now wars over the fish.</i>

1075
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,252
<i>One of the causes
for the infamous pirates of Somalia,</i>

1076
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,254
<i>now feared across the world,</i>

1077
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,214
<i>was actually illegal fishing.</i>

1078
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:23,093
<i>They were once humble fisherman
working to feed their families.</i>

1079
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,220
<i>But when Somalia fell to civil war,</i>

1080
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,557
<i>foreign illegal fishing vessels,
the real pirates of today's oceans,</i>

1081
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,143
<i>invaded their waters
and began taking the fish,</i>

1082
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,146
<i>effectively pulling food
from their mouths,</i>

1083
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,276
<i>giving Somali fishermen no choice
but to move into another line of work.</i>

1084
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,778
<i>This plundering
of the African Coast, though,</i>

1085
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,530
<i>was happening across the continent.</i>

1086
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,783
<i>And Sea Shepherd was on
a daring mission to end this,</i>

1087
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,159
<i>working with governments</i>

1088
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,829
<i>to track down and arrest
illegal fishing vessels</i>

1089
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,747
<i>in places like Liberia.</i>

1090
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,255
<i>Despite the warnings of traveling
to this region of the world,</i>

1091
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,090
<i>we decided to join Sea Shepherd</i>

1092
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,509
<i>to get up close to the front line
of this problem.</i>

1093
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,973
We have mostly international fleets
coming from countries

1094
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:12,767
where they've already depleted
their own local stocks,

1095
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,646
and they're pushing further and further
away to try and make up for that.

1096
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,774
And using more and more
sophisticated technology

1097
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,443
to increase their catch numbers.

1098
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,028
When we look at international fleets,

1099
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,322
they come here,
and they either fish illegally...

1100
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,782
And what they're catching
is worth huge, huge amounts,

1101
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,576
so it's like a gold rush.

1102
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,787
Our coastal waters had now become
a free-for-all,

1103
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:36,291
until, quite recently,
when we decided to pay attention to that,

1104
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,876
and try to police it.

1105
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:40,587
For us, with the military,
when we go on these operations,

1106
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,630
we assume the highest alert.

1107
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,716
We know that it's piracy going on.

1108
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,093
So indeed, it's a dangerous operation.

1109
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,185
<i>Upon arrival,</i>

1110
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:58,355
<i>it became clear
why the ocean around West Africa</i>

1111
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,814
<i>was so worth protecting.</i>

1112
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,863
<i>It was home to one of the last strongholds
of life in our oceans.</i>

1113
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,619
<i>Teeming with rare and wonderful wildlife
of all kinds.</i>

1114
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,917
<i>Countless species journeyed across
the Atlantic Ocean</i>

1115
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,211
<i>to find themselves in these waters.</i>

1116
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,963
<i>A refuge for mating and feeding.</i>

1117
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,592
<i>Living in as close to harmony and balance
as I'd ever seen.</i>

1118
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,553
<i>But there was another species,</i>

1119
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,140
<i>journeying to these waters
for a very different purpose.</i>

1120
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,812
<i>It didn't take long to witness
how Sea Shepherd</i>

1121
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,856
<i>and the Liberian Coast Guard
tracked down and boarded fishing vessels.</i>

1122
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,998
<i>Species I had never seen
in my entire life</i>

1123
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,960
<i>were dying in the nets
before I could even appreciate them.</i>

1124
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,254
<i>But the scenes continued below deck,</i>

1125
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:08,967
<i>where it became clear that these vessels
were more like floating slaughterhouses.</i>

1126
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,012
This is the hold
of just one purse seiner ship.

1127
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:17,183
And this is just the tip of the iceberg,
it goes down the whole size of the ship.

1128
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,060
There could be
hundreds of thousands of fish.

1129
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:23,106
Seeing how hard it is to get on this ship,
you need pretty much a military operation.

1130
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,950
Plus, they could be fishing unsustainably,
and no one would ever know.

1131
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,194
They could sell this
as sustainably certified.

1132
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:32,365
So I just don't see how you could possibly
enforce sustainable fishing laws

1133
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,576
with all these boats this far out at sea.

1134
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,954
I just don't see how it's possible.

1135
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,129
<i>It's at nighttime</i>

1136
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:49,048
<i>that illegal fishing thrives
under the cloak of darkness.</i>

1137
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,218
<i>Vessels entering the waters
of other countries without detection</i>

1138
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,928
<i>and stealing the fish.</i>

1139
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:57,891
<i>But that was also prime time
for Sea Shepherd to do their work.</i>

1140
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,269
Yeah, we gonna board the vessel,
we have to do it as soon as possible.

1141
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,479
<i>Copy that.</i>

1142
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,982
So, Sea Shepherd have just spotted
a boat on the horizon.

1143
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,233
It's on the radars.

1144
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,902
Could be an illegal fishing vessel.

1145
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,528
We're about to go and find out.

1146
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,991
<i>The ship was a Chinese trawler.</i>

1147
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,828
<i>In its hold were huge quantities
of illegally-caught fish.</i>

1148
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,623
<i>The vessel was detained and fined.</i>

1149
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:05,250
<i>It was only one victory,</i>

1150
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,294
<i>but it sent a clear message
to the other ships in the area,</i>

1151
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,339
<i>that there were now real consequences
to their illegal actions.</i>

1152
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,551
<i>Still on the illegal fishing vessel
after sunrise,</i>

1153
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,928
<i>as the ship was getting ready
to be taken back to port,</i>

1154
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,305
<i>I saw some men rowing up to the ship.</i>

1155
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,101
<i>I remembered the piracy warning
from the Minister of Defense,</i>

1156
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,311
<i>but these men didn't look like pirates.</i>

1157
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,232
<i>Why were they risking their lives
in open waters on a small canoe?</i>

1158
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,151
<i>Suddenly, I saw this.</i>

1159
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,280
<i>They were hungry.</i>

1160
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,994
If you look along the coast,
these are people who've lived here

1161
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,829
from time immemorial.

1162
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:45,290
That's their livelihood,
that's their way of life.

1163
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:49,085
But when we allow the industrial fishing
to come so close into their zone,

1164
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,963
it doesn't give them a chance
to get a good catch out of there.

1165
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,632
'Cause if he cannot catch
what he's supposed to catch

1166
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,261
because a commercial vessel has come up
and scoop up everything from here,

1167
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,846
he's destined to go further out.

1168
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,806
These guys are out here
without life vests.

1169
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,516
It's dangerous. Anything can happen.

1170
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,436
You get kicked out of your boat,
or your canoe, that's it.

1171
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,980
<i>Fisheries workers at sea</i>

1172
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,357
<i>have some of the most dangerous jobs
on Earth.</i>

1173
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,317
<i>In context,</i>

1174
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,820
<i>over 4,500 US soldiers were killed</i>

1175
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:18,698
<i>in the Iraq War
over the course of 15 years.</i>

1176
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,366
<i>But during that same time,</i>

1177
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,787
<i>360,000 fisheries workers died
doing their job,</i>

1178
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:29,042
<i>as an estimated 24,000 workers
die every year.</i>

1179
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,127
<i>And West African canoe fishermen</i>

1180
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,338
<i>happened to have
the highest mortality rates</i>

1181
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,590
<i>of any fisheries job on the planet.</i>

1182
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,218
Huge numbers of people
depended on the fish,

1183
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,887
which is now mostly gone.

1184
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,805
That's caused a great deal of hunger,

1185
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:47,101
not just on the coast,
but up to a thousand miles inland.

1186
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,270
So, what do people do
for fishing instead?

1187
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:51,773
They'll hunt wild animals on land.

1188
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,276
And that has not only had
devastating impacts

1189
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,362
on animal life on land,

1190
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,823
it also seems to have had
a very major impact on human life,

1191
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,867
because it's the bushmeat trade

1192
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,454
which is responsible
for the Ebola epidemics.

1193
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,666
You can actually stand this up,
it's in the scientific literature.

1194
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,002
The theft of fish stocks is enhancing

1195
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,923
or causing Ebola outbreaks of West Africa.

1196
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,427
<i>As our trip in Liberia
drew to a close,</i>

1197
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,472
<i>I questioned whether there was
any alternative fishing method</i>

1198
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,432
<i>that could provide some kind of solution</i>

1199
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,850
<i>to both the environmental</i>

1200
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,687
<i>and humanitarian ramifications
of this industry.</i>

1201
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,857
<i>And a glimmer of hope presented itself
in the form of fish farming,</i>

1202
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,567
<i>an industry with the reputation</i>

1203
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:39,070
<i>of being an eco-friendly way
to feed the world</i>

1204
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,572
<i>without all the problems
of wild-caught fish.</i>

1205
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:44,867
<i>With no bycatch, no illegal fishing,</i>

1206
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,285
<i>no sea-floor damage,</i>

1207
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,329
<i>no killing of endangered species,</i>

1208
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,081
<i>and no dangerous working conditions,</i>

1209
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,958
<i>it was exactly what I was looking for.</i>

1210
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,168
Yeah, so a lot of people
jump to the conclusion

1211
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,796
that sustainable seafood
comes from farming fish

1212
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,339
and not high seas fishing,

1213
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,425
but it's really not the case.

1214
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:04,011
Uh, there's so many issues involved
with farming fish,

1215
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,098
uh, being pollution, disease,
and we have to ask the question,

1216
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,891
"What are these fish being fed?"

1217
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,215
<i>What were they being fed?</i>

1218
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,604
<i>The industry claim that to produce
one kilogram of farmed salmon,</i>

1219
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:16,441
<i>only 1.2 kilograms of feed is needed.</i>

1220
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:20,403
<i>But when I looked further,
I found the feed is heavily processed,</i>

1221
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,238
<i>and is made of dried fish meal</i>

1222
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,865
<i>and extracted fish oil,</i>

1223
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,993
<i>which requires a massive amount
of fish to produce.</i>

1224
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,620
<i>So in reality,
you need many times more fish</i>

1225
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,372
<i>going into the farmer's feed</i>

1226
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,790
<i>than will ever come out.</i>

1227
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,459
<i>So fish farming</i>

1228
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,461
<i>was just wild fishing in disguise.</i>

1229
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,213
<i>And what made this even more shocking</i>

1230
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,467
<i>was the scale fish farming
already operates at.</i>

1231
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,595
<i>Today, around 50% of the world's seafood</i>

1232
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,805
<i>is coming from farms like these.</i>

1233
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:53,060
<i>Huge cages in the ocean
containing tens of thousands of fish.</i>

1234
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,773
<i>So we decided to leave Liberia</i>

1235
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,358
<i>and journey back to the UK, for Scotland,</i>

1236
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,195
<i>one of the world's leading producers
of farmed salmon.</i>

1237
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,947
<i>Since none of the major companies
wanted to speak to us,</i>

1238
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,242
<i>we decided to meet with some of
the industry's whistleblowers instead.</i>

1239
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,329
The salmon farming industry
in Scotland is extremely powerful.

1240
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:14,332
And we're talking about
billion-dollar multinationals,

1241
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:17,668
which have the resources and the skills
to dominate the narrative,

1242
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,922
and ensure that the only information
that gets out

1243
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,725
is the information
they're comfortable with.

1244
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,550
So when I went to document the issues,

1245
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,261
ended up making my way out
to one of the farms.

1246
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,390
And there, I filmed some of
the most severe sea lice infestations

1247
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:32,809
that's ever been recorded.

1248
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,772
<i>Corin was able to capture footage
of salmon being eaten alive</i>

1249
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:40,358
<i>by an infestation of sea lice parasites.</i>

1250
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:43,611
<i>A common reality of fish farming
across the world.</i>

1251
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,656
<i>It was sad to think
that this incredible species,</i>

1252
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:48,866
<i>which had evolved for millions of years</i>

1253
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,744
<i>to migrate across entire oceans
and navigate up rivers</i>

1254
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,247
<i>to reach the exact same spawning grounds
they were born in,</i>

1255
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,959
<i>were now confined to swim in circles
in their own filth.</i>

1256
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,671
So, it's estimated
that each salmon farm in Scotland

1257
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:06,425
produces organic waste equivalent
to a town of 10 to 20,000 people.

1258
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,928
And taken together,
it's estimated that

1259
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,889
the Scottish salmon farming industry
produces organic waste

1260
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,851
equivalent to the entire population
of Scotland each year.

1261
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:23,109
<i>The next activist I wanted to meet
was Don Staniford,</i>

1262
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:27,905
<i>who'd been going undercover to expose
the reality of fish farms for years.</i>

1263
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,032
<i>And we agreed to go undercover with him.</i>

1264
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:34,495
So, we're here
at Marine Harvest Salmon Farm,

1265
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,705
and it's disgusting.

1266
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,374
This is the...
this is the stench of Scottish salmon.

1267
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,544
This is where salmon go to die
from the farms.

1268
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:45,965
Maybe 50% of the salmon are dying
from egg to plate, from hatch to catch.

1269
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,050
And this is the Mortality Mountain.

1270
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,262
This is a symptom
of factory battery salmon farming.

1271
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,431
These fish are dying from anemia,

1272
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:54,849
lice infestation,

1273
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,350
infectious diseases,

1274
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,019
chlamydia, heart disease.

1275
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,270
This is welfare abuse.

1276
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:02,315
So, far from being a panacea
for the world food problem,

1277
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,609
salmon farming is a waste of resources.

1278
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,527
It's biological nonsense.

1279
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,155
<i>The stench was horrifying.</i>

1280
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:11,365
<i>These weren't the bright orange
and pink salmon</i>

1281
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,117
<i>I'd seen in the commercials.</i>

1282
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,286
So, farmed salmon,

1283
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,706
without colorants being added to its feed,
would be completely gray,

1284
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:23,044
to the extent that salmon farmers
can actually select from a color chart,

1285
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,879
much like you get
when painting your house.

1286
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:28,382
You can select the pinkness of the salmon
that you're gonna produce.

1287
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,426
So it wouldn't be for me to say,

1288
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,846
but it does seem like people are eating
gray fish that's painted pink.

1289
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,517
<i>This was the real monster
in the lochs of Scotland.</i>

1290
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,062
<i>But the environmental impact
of farming marine life</i>

1291
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,438
<i>didn't end with fish.</i>

1292
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:46,817
One of the world's most important habitats
is mangroves.

1293
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:50,780
Now, mangrove forests
are absolutely crucial storm barriers.

1294
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:55,368
They protect communities
from storm surges, even from tsunamis.

1295
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:59,664
And yet, 38% of the world's mangroves
have been destroyed

1296
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,999
by shrimp and prawn farming.

1297
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:06,253
However, it's the shrimp feed which is
having the greatest humanitarian impact,

1298
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,756
because it depends on slavery.

1299
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,258
We hear a lot about blood diamonds.

1300
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,094
This is blood shrimp.

1301
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:18,349
<i>This recent aerial footage
shows a fisherman in Southeast Asia</i>

1302
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,726
<i>writing a secret message to the drone,</i>

1303
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,478
<i>out of sight of the captain.</i>

1304
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:30,152
Slavery at sea is a massive problem.

1305
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,739
I think it's very hard
to give precise figures,

1306
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,867
precisely because it operates
under the radar.

1307
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:40,162
Those people
who are driving these abuses,

1308
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,373
for obvious reasons,
don't want to get found out.

1309
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,834
In that regard, I would point to Thailand.

1310
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:49,046
So there are now somewhere in the region
of about 51,000 boats fishing

1311
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,048
in Thai waters under the Thai flag.

1312
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:56,804
They had to find a way of fishing
ever more cheaply to catch fewer fish.

1313
01:06:56,887 --> 01:07:00,349
And that's where
the inherent vulnerability begins.

1314
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:05,730
Most of those boats would not be economic
without this free, cheap labor.

1315
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,360
<i>I had no idea when I started
my journey that it would lead me here,</i>

1316
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:14,405
<i>but it was hard to believe the
fishing industry could be this corrupt.</i>

1317
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:17,158
<i>The information I was finding online
was conflicting,</i>

1318
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:21,370
<i>so I wanted to ask the industry myself,
at an international seafood expo</i>

1319
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,664
<i>open only to industry insiders.</i>

1320
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:25,499
<i>We created fake business cards</i>

1321
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,710
<i>for a fake seafood company to sneak in,</i>

1322
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,795
<i>which actually worked,</i>

1323
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,089
<i>and secretly filmed my interaction</i>

1324
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,341
<i>with a representative from Thai seafood.</i>

1325
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,843
I was doing some research...

1326
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:36,761
Research?

1327
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:41,057
Research. And I found out
that a lot of, uh, Thai shrimp and prawns

1328
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,434
are coming from slave labor.
People kidnapped...

1329
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:45,186
- Oh, no, no!
- It's not true?

1330
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,270
No, not true!

1331
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:48,593
- Whoa! So they're lying?
- Lying.

1332
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:51,734
- So there's no slavery going on?
- No, no.

1333
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,179
So why would they say that?

1334
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:56,530
I don't know. You ask them that.

1335
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,200
- Yeah. So it's...
- Business, huh? It's business.

1336
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,118
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, it's business.

1337
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:06,415
<i>I was so fed up by all these
companies and NGOs bluewashing the truth,</i>

1338
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,834
<i>but honestly, I didn't know what to think.</i>

1339
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,878
<i>The only way I could find out for sure</i>

1340
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:13,380
<i>if fishing slavery
was still going on today</i>

1341
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,300
<i>was by actually speaking
to these fishing slaves ourselves.</i>

1342
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:20,471
Would you say there's any
safety concerns for me making this film?

1343
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:22,765
The safety concerns are serious.

1344
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:27,061
And I think,
ignore them at your risk.

1345
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,688
You can see people are being murdered.

1346
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,650
So some of those involved are murderers.

1347
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,111
Somebody might kill you,
and that is possible

1348
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,405
if you're foolish, and if you're
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1349
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:43,119
You can be victim of unfair
or unreasonable actions by the law

1350
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,788
who have been paid,
i.e. a victim of corruption.

1351
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,873
So you have to be extremely careful,

1352
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,377
and the security protocols that you apply

1353
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:54,755
may well mean the difference
between life and death.

1354
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:03,889
<i>We arrived in Bangkok</i>

1355
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:07,101
<i>with the details of a halfway home
for escaped slaves.</i>

1356
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,603
<i>We knew that
just by filming these interviews</i>

1357
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,648
<i>and shining a light on the
criminal activities in the country,</i>

1358
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,192
<i>we were putting ourselves
and those around us at risk.</i>

1359
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,279
Don't film my face.

1360
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:20,364
I can be hunted down for helping you.

1361
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,367
<i>All we could do
was cross our fingers,</i>

1362
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,330
<i>and hope we got the answers
we were looking for.</i>

1363
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:35,212
Could you start off by telling me
how long you were on these ships for?

1364
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,465
I was at sea
for 10 years, 2 months, and 2 days.

1365
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:45,806
I was scared, let me be straight with you.

1366
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:51,729
Nobody could get off the ship,
there were guards that kept eyes on us.

1367
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:56,400
I was at sea for six years.

1368
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:02,406
I was so depressed
I tried to take my own life three times.

1369
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,452
<i>When I first met the captain on land,
we drank and had a good time.</i>

1370
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,330
<i>But once I was on the ship
and the ship left the shore,</i>

1371
01:10:09,413 --> 01:10:11,874
<i>the captain changed from white to red.</i>

1372
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,752
<i>He changed,
like we didn't know each other.</i>

1373
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,838
<i>He bullied and abused me
like we didn't know each other.</i>

1374
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:21,675
<i>He splashed us with boiling water
when we were sick and tired,</i>

1375
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:25,930
<i>hit us whenever he wasn't happy
by using an iron bar,</i>

1376
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:29,350
<i>and threatened us with a gun.</i>

1377
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,355
<i>On the ship I was on,</i>

1378
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:38,776
<i>sometimes they kept dead human bodies
in the freezers after killing them.</i>

1379
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,988
On my ship, boys dropped
into the sea and drowned.

1380
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:50,788
<i>I saw their dead bodies floating
on the water surface days later.</i>

1381
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,791
<i>I felt sorry for their parents,</i>

1382
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:55,918
<i>they would never know
of their son's death.</i>

1383
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:01,048
When ships are in the
middle of the ocean, where problems occur,

1384
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:05,886
they can throw you overboard
into the sea.

1385
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,932
They can just say to the authorities

1386
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:13,560
that you were sick and fell into the sea.

1387
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:18,315
People don't see how we catch seafood,

1388
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,859
they only care for consumption.

1389
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:26,740
A lot of the seafood we're consuming today
is from slavery,

1390
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,410
from forced labor.

1391
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:33,497
I would like to see everyone
stop supporting them

1392
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,708
if that's possible.

1393
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,352
Would you be able
to take us to the slave ships,

1394
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,422
or is it too dangerous to film?

1395
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:43,007
Oh...

1396
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:50,055
It's dangerous for you to make
this documentary, and film these ships.

1397
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,517
If you're scared of dying,
go home.

1398
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,439
<i>At this point, off-camera,</i>

1399
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:01,358
<i>we were notified that we had to end
the interview right then and there</i>

1400
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:02,943
<i>as police were on their way.</i>

1401
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,030
<i>Someone had reported us
for filming without permits,</i>

1402
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,240
<i>and we needed to get out of there
immediately.</i>

1403
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,925
<i>I was sad to be leaving Thailand
so suddenly,</i>

1404
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:30,012
<i>knowing there were young men just like me
trapped on fishing boats</i>

1405
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,638
<i>who'd never be able to go home.</i>

1406
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:35,351
<i>But after risking our safety,
I felt powerless to do anything about it.</i>

1407
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:38,812
<i>Especially knowing the authorities
were involved in covering it up.</i>

1408
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:50,115
<i>Back home, it'd been weeks
since I picked up a camera.</i>

1409
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,160
<i>The gravity of everything
had caught up with me,</i>

1410
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,912
<i>and frankly, I was overwhelmed.</i>

1411
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,914
<i>However, months earlier,</i>

1412
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:59,124
<i>we had booked a trip to the Faroe Islands,</i>

1413
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:03,045
<i>a small archipelago in the North Atlantic
that practiced an old form of whaling.</i>

1414
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,422
<i>We'd booked the trip
back when I thought whaling</i>

1415
01:13:05,506 --> 01:13:07,758
<i>was one of the biggest threats
facing the ocean.</i>

1416
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:11,637
<i>But after witnessing much greater impacts
and the human rights abuses that followed,</i>

1417
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,847
<i>it seemed like a step backwards.</i>

1418
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:17,059
<i>However, this particular form of whaling,
called a "Grind,"</i>

1419
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:21,105
<i>had recently received attention in the
media as a sustainable form of whaling,</i>

1420
01:13:21,188 --> 01:13:24,525
<i>claiming the species of whale aren't
endangered and that hunting them</i>

1421
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,819
<i>caused no environmental damage.</i>

1422
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:30,322
<i>Whales were the whole reason I set out
on this journey in the first place,</i>

1423
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:33,409
<i>and I was skeptical about how sustainable
it could possibly be.</i>

1424
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:37,287
<i>So we decided to make one final trip
to the Faroe Islands,</i>

1425
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,498
<i>in the hopes of
witnessing one of these hunts</i>

1426
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,125
<i>and speaking to a whaler.</i>

1427
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,502
<i>Some years on the islands,</i>

1428
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,088
<i>a whale hunt may only occur
a handful of times.</i>

1429
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,674
<i>Other years, none at all.</i>

1430
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:52,344
<i>We patiently awaited
news of a hunt for ten days,</i>

1431
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,972
<i>until finally, we received the call.</i>

1432
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:01,687
There's a Grind? How far?

1433
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:04,689
Okay.

1434
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:06,733
Hvannasund?

1435
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,985
How do you spell that?

1436
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:10,571
H-V... yeah.

1437
01:14:10,654 --> 01:14:11,947
S-U-N-D.

1438
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,742
Yeah, I know where it is. Okay, okay.
See you later.

1439
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,873
<i>In the chaos
of everything that happened,</i>

1440
01:17:49,956 --> 01:17:52,376
<i>I finally understood sustainability.</i>

1441
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:56,588
<i>It just meant that something
could continu</i> e <i>on and on forever</i>

1442
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,175
<i>regardless of how much
suffering it caused.</i>

1443
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,176
<i>In reality,</i>

1444
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:03,970
<i>the Grind was about as sustainable
as you could get.</i>

1445
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,473
<i>But I began to wonder
whether sustainability</i>

1446
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:09,601
<i>was truly the right goal
for how we took care of the ocean.</i>

1447
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,857
So, I don't feel like I'm a bad person.

1448
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:20,237
If somebody want to say, "Yeah,
you're a bad person for killing a whale."

1449
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:24,449
Uh, I would rather kill one whale
than 2,000 chickens.

1450
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:26,952
That's about the same amount of meat.

1451
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,372
Uh, so if the world
wants to take 2,000 lives,

1452
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:32,708
and we are taking one, you're welcome.

1453
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,626
And at that point,

1454
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,047
I feel like I'm a better person
than many other people

1455
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:41,466
that are thinking about,

1456
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:44,594
"Yeah, we had salmon
for dinner last night."

1457
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:45,678
Yeah?

1458
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:47,723
Four people, salmon,

1459
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:51,017
that means two, three salmons killed.

1460
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:55,689
Do you really feel good about yourself
killing two salmons

1461
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,357
for eating dinner?

1462
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,861
Uh, I can follow the thoughts
that people are saying,

1463
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,197
"If you want to eat, don't kill anything."

1464
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:07,951
Like, just eating vegetables, and fruits,
and stuff like that.

1465
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,202
I can go along with that,

1466
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:13,081
but I really can't go along with people
that are saying,

1467
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,000
Uh, "You must not kill Grind."

1468
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,129
And then, they are killing
or eating other animals.

1469
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:22,340
For me, a fish, a chicken, a whale,

1470
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,801
exactly the same value.

1471
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,261
It has one life.

1472
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:28,095
And...

1473
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,433
some say it doesn't need to be taken
for getting food,

1474
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:33,310
but that's what we are doing.

1475
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:42,652
<i>Although I didn't agree
with everything he said,</i>

1476
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:44,196
<i>the whaler had a point.</i>

1477
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,239
<i>All this time, I had only looked at fish</i>

1478
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:49,576
<i>and other marine life in terms
of sustainability and ecological impact,</i>

1479
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:52,704
<i>but I never considered the lives
of these animals in their own right,</i>

1480
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,039
<i>or whether they could feel.</i>

1481
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:59,669
To me, it's remarkable
that the question is even asked that,

1482
01:19:59,753 --> 01:20:02,255
"Do fish feel pain?"

1483
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:07,052
As a scientist, it's common sense.

1484
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,137
They have a nervous system, fish do.

1485
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:13,266
They have the basic elements
that all vertebrates have.

1486
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:17,646
They have the capacity to feel on a level

1487
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:19,856
that I almost can't imagine we can.

1488
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,400
We feel pain, we feel touch.

1489
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:25,862
But fish have a lateral line
down their sides

1490
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,699
that senses the most exquisite
little movements in the water.

1491
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,285
So you see a thousand fish
moving like one fish.

1492
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:36,039
Those who say, "Doesn't matter what you
do to a fish, they can't feel anything."

1493
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:40,043
Or that they... Their consciousness,
they can't relate to pain,

1494
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:42,254
or they can't sense danger in the future.

1495
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,465
Well, they haven't really observed fish.

1496
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,926
I think it's a justification

1497
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:51,721
for doing dastardly things
to innocent creatures.

1498
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,810
It's the only explanation I can think of
for treating fish

1499
01:20:56,893 --> 01:20:59,187
with such a barbaric attitude.

1500
01:20:59,771 --> 01:21:01,356
So you don't eat fish?

1501
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,526
Oh, I don't eat fish now, or any animal.

1502
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,737
<i>A scientific panel
for the European Union</i>

1503
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:11,491
<i>concluded that fish do in fact feel pain
and experience fear.</i>

1504
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,077
<i>Just like dolphins and whales,</i>

1505
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,329
<i>fish can also have complex social lives,</i>

1506
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:19,791
<i>even teaming up with other species
to find food.</i>

1507
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,587
<i>With research proving, once and for all,
the intelligence, memory capabilities,</i>

1508
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,213
<i>and sentience of these animals,</i>

1509
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:28,258
<i>fish, and even crustaceans,
were more like us</i>

1510
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,843
<i>than we ever expected.</i>

1511
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:33,305
Fishes probably invented all
of the familiar senses to us.

1512
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,265
Uh, they've been around a long time.

1513
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:38,018
So they have excellent vision, hearing,

1514
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:40,395
sense of touch, sense of smell and taste.

1515
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,606
They have the right kind of pain receptors

1516
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,901
for physical, chemical,
and heat types of pain,

1517
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,736
the same three kinds that we have.

1518
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:51,698
And also, there's evidence
that fishes show, uh, curiosity,

1519
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:53,742
perhaps concern, perhaps, uh, fear,

1520
01:21:53,825 --> 01:21:56,536
when they can see other fishes
being taken out of their tanks,

1521
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,164
and chopped up on a block
right outside the tank.

1522
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:01,124
It could be family members,
or relatives,

1523
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:04,502
or just individuals
who they've gotten to like over time.

1524
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:08,798
There's emerging science on how animals
do use democratic decision-making.

1525
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:12,552
One example is herrings, they have
a very curious way of communicating.

1526
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,387
They actually fart to communicate.

1527
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,641
So, if 60% of the herrings
in the school are farting,

1528
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:20,602
then that means it's time to leave,
maybe not surprisingly.

1529
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:23,813
But they actually use that
as a communication tool.

1530
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,651
I can't keep a straight face.

1531
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,557
<i>As hilarious as that was,</i>

1532
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:34,032
<i>I'd always been taught that seafood
was an important part of a healthy diet,</i>

1533
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,450
<i>and I still had some questions.</i>

1534
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:38,745
What am I going to miss out on
if I stopped eating seafood?

1535
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,456
Well, what you're gonna miss out on,

1536
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,124
if you stopped eating seafood,

1537
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,710
is you're gonna miss out on
all that toxic heavy metal.

1538
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:46,795
Mercury, right?

1539
01:22:46,878 --> 01:22:50,340
You're gonna decrease your intake
of dioxins and PCBs,

1540
01:22:50,423 --> 01:22:52,801
these other, you know,
persistent organic pollutants.

1541
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:54,844
The aquatic food chain

1542
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:59,099
is the most concentrated source
of industrial pollutants.

1543
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:00,725
The thought of clean fish?

1544
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,770
There's just dirty fish
and then dirtier fish.

1545
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:06,690
And so if you look at the number one
source of dioxin exposure,

1546
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:09,234
of toxic heavy metal exposure,
PCB exposure,

1547
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,860
of hexachlorobenzene,

1548
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,655
plastics compounds,
flame-retardant chemicals...

1549
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:15,532
I mean,
you name your industrial pollutant,

1550
01:23:15,615 --> 01:23:17,325
it's found most concentrated in fish.

1551
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:22,122
Again, because that's just where
the pollutants eventually end up.

1552
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:25,250
Mercury is totally a toxicant
to the body.

1553
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,795
Let's say mercury from some industry
pollutes the air or the water.

1554
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:32,549
Small bacteria, plankton,
they start picking up on the mercury.

1555
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:34,968
And then, small creatures eat those.

1556
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:38,388
Then you've got the smaller fish
eaten by the bigger fish, and so on.

1557
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:41,516
In essence,
this is called bioaccumulation.

1558
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:45,103
So there's other things in fish,
it's not just omega-3 fatty acids.

1559
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:50,025
Those contaminants oftentimes
outweigh the benefits of the nutrients.

1560
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:52,902
A common belief is
that fish are the best source

1561
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,530
of these essential omega-3 fatty acids,

1562
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:59,909
but people don't realize
that fish don't make omega-3 fatty acids.

1563
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,288
It's the algae cells
that are making the omega-3 fats,

1564
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,999
and the fish swallow the algae cells.

1565
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:10,045
And the algal DHA is what winds up
in the fish's flesh,

1566
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,714
that when we kill the fish,
and crush its flesh,

1567
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:15,842
and squeeze out the "fish oil"
for the omega-3s,

1568
01:24:15,925 --> 01:24:18,470
it was really algae oil
in there all the time.

1569
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:22,515
So why not just eat the algae that has
those great benefits we're looking for?

1570
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,726
Why even mess with the middleman,

1571
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,436
and just eat the direct source.

1572
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:29,606
We started New Wave Foods
with the mission to disrupt seafood,

1573
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:32,901
not oceans,
by creating seafood from sea plants.

1574
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:36,112
So you're not gonna miss out on taste,
it's there for you. It's delicious.

1575
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:39,449
But you will miss the cholesterol,
there's no PCBs,

1576
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:42,535
no mercury, no heavy antibiotics.

1577
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,955
You get the things you want from seafood,
but none of the negative things.

1578
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,499
Plant-based solutions, I think,

1579
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:50,794
is definitely one of the best options
that we have to go forward.

1580
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:55,006
Traditional animal agriculture,
raising cows and chickens on land,

1581
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,382
have huge impacts in the ocean.

1582
01:24:56,466 --> 01:24:59,677
The runoff from those procedures
create dead zones in the environment.

1583
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,388
And fishing and fish farming, too.
So if we can find alternatives

1584
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:05,016
that are just as delicious,
just as healthy for you,

1585
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,061
but better for the environment,
why wouldn't we do it?

1586
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,647
<i>My journey had taken me far.</i>

1587
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:13,525
<i>And despite witnessing
catastrophic destruction,</i>

1588
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:16,528
<i>I had more admiration for the ocean
than ever before.</i>

1589
01:25:17,028 --> 01:25:19,197
<i>I felt empowered by what I'd learned,</i>

1590
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,908
<i>and couldn't wait to put it into practice.</i>

1591
01:25:21,991 --> 01:25:24,410
<i>Although I still pick up trash on beaches,</i>

1592
01:25:24,494 --> 01:25:27,580
<i>and have embarked on a project
to continue investigating</i>

1593
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:30,041
<i>and reporting on environmental issues,</i>

1594
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,293
<i>with so many plant-based alternatives</i>

1595
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:35,630
<i>emerging for almost every seafood product
I could imagine...</i>

1596
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:41,302
<i>I realized the single best thing
I could do every single day</i>

1597
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,556
<i>to protect the ocean
and the marine life I loved,</i>

1598
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:45,639
<i>was to simply...</i>

1599
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:47,308
<i>not eat them.</i>

1600
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:50,895
If we protect more
and fish less,

1601
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,939
and restore that kind of balance

1602
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:54,649
and healthy ecosystem,

1603
01:25:54,732 --> 01:25:57,986
they've got a good chance of making it
through the tough times ahead.

1604
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,320
There is real hope here

1605
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:03,491
because marine ecosystems
bounce back so quickly

1606
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:04,575
if they're allowed to.

1607
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:07,287
You would see the reefs coming back,

1608
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:11,624
you would see
these incredible shoals of fish returning,

1609
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,586
you would see the whales
returning to our coast.

1610
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:17,046
This is within our grasp.

1611
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,506
We can do this.

1612
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,176
The prospects for marine recovery,

1613
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,928
for rewilding, are incredibly exciting,

1614
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:27,765
but it can only happen
if very large areas of sea

1615
01:26:28,349 --> 01:26:30,935
are closed to commercial fishing.

1616
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,147
And while governments
are not prepared to take action,

1617
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:37,442
and while the industry
is basically unregulated,

1618
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:39,485
the only ethical thing to do

1619
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,696
is to stop eating fish.

1620
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:47,785
It isn't too late to take the best hope
we will ever have

1621
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,913
of having a home in this universe.

1622
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:53,333
To respect what we've got,
to protect what remains,

1623
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,335
don't let any of the pieces escape.

1624
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:58,338
Most of the positive and negative things

1625
01:26:58,421 --> 01:27:01,257
that bring about change
in human civilization

1626
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:02,800
start with someone.

1627
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:04,677
Some "one."

1628
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:08,097
And no <i>one</i> can do <i>everything,</i>

1629
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:11,893
but every <i>one</i> can do <i>something.</i>

1630
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:13,770
And sometimes,

1631
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:16,773
big ideas make a big difference.

1632
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:18,816
That's what we can do.

1633
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,569
That's what you can do right now.

1634
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:24,489
Look in the mirror, figure it out.

1635
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:25,572
Go for it.
