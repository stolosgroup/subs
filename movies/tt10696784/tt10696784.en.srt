2
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,083
Not at the table, son.

3
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,541
Come on.

4
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,125
Mmm-mmm.

5
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,458
Grace first.

6
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:56,958
You know better.

7
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:04,791
Father, we are gathered here
to share this food in your name.

8
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,083
Bless this food into our bodies, O Lord.

9
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:13,000
Bless our hearts
and all that we do, O Lord,

10
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,000
so that we may walk in your name...

11
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,375
Who will that be at this time?

12
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,583
I have no idea.

13
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,625
No.

14
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,583
Leave my family alone.

15
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,333
Theodore.

16
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,500
It's okay.

17
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,666
It's okay.

18
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,916
Leave them out of this.

19
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,083
Your quarrel is with me.

20
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,833
Let's go outside, take a walk,

21
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,250
and handle our business.

22
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,833
- Please.
- No.

23
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,416
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,583
Please, I'm begging you.

25
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,833
No!

26
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,458
No! No! No! No!

27
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:15,083
No! No! No!

28
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,791
No! No! Please!

29
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,750
No!

30
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:28,958
No! No, no, no, no, no! No!

31
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,916
Father Esparza?

32
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,875
I'm here for confession…

33
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,416
And the collection.

34
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,083
You know what happens
when you're late with my coins.

35
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,416
What possesses a man

36
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,375
to paint a scorpion on his hand?

37
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:33,125
Excuse me?

38
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,208
A snake,

39
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,291
I understand that.

40
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,333
The Garden of Eden, the Bible, etcetera.

41
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,500
But a scorpion?

42
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,541
Well, that puzzles me.

43
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:49,875
Who are you?

44
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,750
Just a man.

45
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,041
Here to kill the Scorpion.

46
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:56,500
Jesus Cortez.

47
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:07,083
Those were, uh, different times.

48
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,791
Whatever happened between you and I

49
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,791
must have been a long, long time ago.

50
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,125
No.

51
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,375
No.

52
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,291
Please.

53
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:39,416
Please.

54
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:42,750
I…

55
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:45,541
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:53,708
I'm sorry.

57
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:29,416
Is it over?

58
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,583
This is a wanted man.

59
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,708
Turn his body in,
you'll get $5,000 for your church.

60
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,666
Why aren't you
taking him in yourself?

61
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,291
I'm worth ten.

62
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,416
Yeah!

63
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,958
It's the Nat Love Gang!

64
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,000
Stop firing! Stop firing!

65
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,958
It's one man! We got him pinned!

66
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,166
Wait for his head to show,
then blow the naps off that motherfucker.

67
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,958
Be patient.

68
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,916
I hear patience is a virtue.

69
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,083
But I ain't never been able to wait
to see if the motherfucker true.

70
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,708
- Jim Beckwourth.
- Brothers Grime.

71
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,458
It's Grimes with an "S,"
you egotistical piece of shit.

72
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,208
I remember a time
y'all hoods used to be crimson.

73
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,791
Known as the Crimson Hood Gang.

74
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
Them motherfuckers pink now.

75
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,791
You know, Mama used to say, "Jim is
such a sweet boy." You know what I said?

76
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,958
"Mama, fuck Jim!
Look what he did to my fucking eye!"

77
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,208
- I <i>am </i>sweet.
- You're not sweet.

78
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,708
- I'm sweet.
- You're not sweet.

79
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,125
- I'm sweet.
- You're not.

80
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,333
- Bitch, I'm sweet.
- You know what?

81
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,708
I'd rather be dead
than hear this motherfucker keep talking.

82
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,791
Whoo.

83
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,333
Much obliged, motherfuckers.

84
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
What the hell is that shit,

85
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,916
playing quick-draw games
when my ass is getting shot at?

86
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,458
Hey, hey.
You got your lucky coin, don't you?

87
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,375
Grow up, Jim.
This is real grown-men shit. We can die.

88
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,000
But we not gonna die.

89
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,041
'Cause I'm lightnin'
with the blam-blams. Admit it.

90
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,125
You know, you might could be,
but I hearsay there's a quick draw

91
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,625
more lightnin' than you,
go by the name of Cherokee Bill.

92
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,875
"Cherokee Bill."

93
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,541
You hearsay.

94
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,208
You don't see-say.

95
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,708
So I say fuck Cherokee Bill.

96
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,583
You know, rather than complaining,
you should be applauding my performance.

97
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,541
The only words that should be
coming out your Black-ass lips…

98
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,208
- "Black-ass lips"?
- …should be…

99
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,875
- <i>…gracias.</i>
- That was smooth.

100
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,708
- I know.
- Black lips are beautiful lips.

101
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,333
- Would you stop reaching, negro?
- God damn.

102
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,041
You just killed my brother.

103
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,625
Your half-brother, calm down.
Look like your day going a little bad.

104
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,416
Better than you sons of bitches

105
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,458
when you find out
whose money you done fucked with.

106
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,458
Correction. Who <i>you</i> done fucked with.

107
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,083
Y'all rob banks. We rob y'all.

108
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,500
And ain't a negro from here to Africa
gonna know we even exist.

109
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,458
You think I'm talking about a bank?

110
00:15:08,291 --> 00:15:12,250
Evening, gent. Kindly check your weapon
and enjoy the festivities.

111
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,541
This is Stagecoach Mary's place
and ain't no guns allowed?

112
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,291
'Cept for Mary's, naturally.

113
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,000
Naturally.

114
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,916
Naturally, she put a fresh-faced pup
like yourself here to see to it.

115
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,791
Oh, I got to see
to a lot of things, Mr. Love.

116
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,958
People see me and they don't feel
too intimidated by what they see. See?

117
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,875
We familiar?

118
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,250
No, but you right famous
around these parts.

119
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,416
Folks say you once cut down
three men with one bullet.

120
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,625
Now, I ain't met a man
who can do that yet. Excuse me.

121
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,833
Evening, gents. Kindly check your weapons
and enjoy your evening.

122
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,791
I'd sooner check my right arm, boy.

123
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,666
Then you can head on over
to Jourdon Anderson's.

124
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,875
You can hold your weapon
and drink over there.

125
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
We drinking here, you puny little fuck.

126
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,333
Hey!

127
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,666
Some folk tend to feel a way, regardless.

128
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,541
Get 'em over to Doc Brown's.

129
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,000
Take they guns to the sheriff.

130
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,958
They can get 'em back
when they leave town.

131
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,916
What they call you?

132
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,208
They call me Cuffee.

133
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,666
This why I'm here!

134
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,291
Don't hurt nobody!

135
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:14,375
Come again.

136
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:36,666
Not again.

137
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,666
You still ain't talking to me?

138
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,458
Get out.

139
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,625
What?

140
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,458
I said leave.

141
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,541
What was that kiss for, then?

142
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,958
To remind you of what it was.

143
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,250
That's to remind you of what it is.

144
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,916
Excuse me.

145
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,125
Cuff, clean this man up.

146
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,041
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

147
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,708
Second floor. Third room on the left.

148
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:44,958
Mary.

149
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,458
The only thing I need to hear
coming out your mouth is "Goodbye, Mary."

150
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,958
The one thing
you'll never hear me say again.

151
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,833
Till the next time you hear tell

152
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,041
of the whereabouts
of some man that done you dirt.

153
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,916
Ain't none of them left.

154
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,833
So you found the Scorpion?

155
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,291
Mary, the only thing that mean anything
to me in this world now

156
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,000
is you.

157
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,541
And what about the Nat Love Gang?

158
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,166
Ain't been much of a gang since you left.

159
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,500
Just me, Jim, Bill.

160
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,875
Next time they come around, I'll sort it.

161
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,375
Mmm.

162
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,458
You know, I can almost believe that.

163
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,041
Almost, 'cause you didn't get
the last one, did you?

164
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,875
You can say his name, Mary.

165
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,375
What about Rufus Buck?

166
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,833
Rufus in Yuma
for the rest of his natural life.

167
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,708
For a man like him,
that's worse than death.

168
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,333
As long as that man draw breath,

169
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,208
your spirit is gonna be cursed
and wild as it ever was.

170
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,125
Hmm.

171
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,833
I made things,

172
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,916
I built things,
and I ain't gonna risk all that

173
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
just because you decide
to come trottin' back.

174
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,583
- "Trottin'"?
- Yeah.

175
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,250
- Okay, well.
- Mmm-hmm.

176
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,625
I guess I came to the wrong saloon

177
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,666
'cause I ain't talking
to the Mary Fields I thought I knew.

178
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
- Yep. Things have changed.
- I see that.

179
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,541
Mmm-hmm.

180
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,333
'Cause that Mary…

181
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,166
That Mary…

182
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,541
…don't shy away from nothin'.

183
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,125
What was it the Apache called you?

184
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,333
Wolf Lady?

185
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,166
No. That's some bullshit
Pickett used to say.

186
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,083
That's bullshit Pickett used to say.

187
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,875
- Apache called me Coyote Woman.
- Hmm.

188
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,500
Yeah, Wolf Lady more like it.

189
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,875
My hat.

190
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,416
There.

191
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,666
I'm coming in.

192
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,125
Now, Wolf Lady,
don't blow the head off my neck.

193
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
- Nat.
- Pickett.

194
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,333
You got the worst timing
in the history of timing.

195
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,583
Oh, y'all was makin' sex?

196
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,125
I apologize.

197
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,125
But what I got to show you can't wait.

198
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,875
Well, well, well.

199
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,916
If it ain't the debonair dipshit himself.

200
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,291
Whoa, easy, Nat.
Listen to what the man got to say first.

201
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,375
So he can tell me
the same stories he been tellin' you?

202
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,000
Why the fuck would I lie?

203
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:27,083
Rufus Buck is behind bars
for the rest of his life.

204
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,916
- He gettin' out.
- How?

205
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,583
Damned if I know.

206
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,416
I just know it's so.

207
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,041
All the gangs are gettin' set
to ride for him again.

208
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,500
Half that take was his.

209
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:47,958
And you fools took <i>his </i>money.

210
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,666
You think Rufus Buck
was gonna let you keep half that money,

211
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,333
and you callin' me a fool?

212
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,708
I guess I am.

213
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,750
On your feet.

214
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,083
Exhale.

215
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:37,958
Now get out of here.

216
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,666
Leave.

217
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,666
What you doin'? We coulda killed
the last of the Crimson Hoods.

218
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,208
It's called the Crimson Hood Gang.
You think that's the last one?

219
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:57,958
Yeah.

220
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,416
I woulda bet my left six-shooter
he was about to kill that boy.

221
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,125
If that man telling the truth,
Nat just did him a whole lot worse.

222
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,541
What the hell
are you doin' out here?

223
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,500
That ain't no way to board a train,
you damn stupid ni...

224
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,458
You know, he might coulda said nincompoop.

225
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,791
We ain't no nincompoop.

226
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,166
If they say something
that even start with "N,"

227
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,083
they gonna meet the same fate.

228
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,166
Let 'em see your faces.

229
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,375
All right, stay calm, everybody.
Don't… Hey, don't touch nothin'.

230
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,833
My name is Cherokee Bill.

231
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,041
Now let it be known
that I don't particularly enjoy violence.

232
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,708
That being said,

233
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,166
you are currently in the company
of extremely violent individuals.

234
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,833
Try some of that.

235
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,166
Ugh. Shit.

236
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,416
So, don't do no stupid shit. All right?

237
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,291
Get off this train now,
you motherless scum.

238
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,500
You must be the hero.

239
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,958
Great Spirit, why is there always one?

240
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,916
You're rude.

241
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,875
I might actually enjoy
inflicting violence on you.

242
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,166
But who knows?

243
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
Maybe you'll win.

244
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:08,875
Let's see.

245
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,416
See my point?

246
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,750
Now, step aside so that we may conclude
our business here without further ado.

247
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,958
All right, everybody...

248
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,416
Stop right there.

249
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,333
No.

250
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,916
I said stop.

251
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,750
Put the weapon down, boy.

252
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,583
Or we kill everybody on this train.

253
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,041
I said put the gun down.

254
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,125
It's okay.

255
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,791
Are there any more soldiers on that car?

256
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,875
There are.

257
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,583
Exactly how many?

258
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,708
Thirty.

259
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,208
Ten!

260
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,958
See, that's all you had to say.

261
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,291
Open the door.

262
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,125
I said open the damn door.

263
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,041
Here we are.

264
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:50,833
My dear battalion.

265
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,750
I imagine you have
all your artillery aimed at the door.

266
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,375
I'd like to inform you
that in front of that door

267
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,666
lies one of your very own troops.

268
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,416
Any bullets coming through that door
will hit him first, okay?

269
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,375
State your name, criminal.

270
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:13,250
Oh, I'm not a criminal, sir, um,
but my name is Cherokee Bill.

271
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,458
What's your name?

272
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,875
My name is Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

273
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,500
You let that soldier go immediately.

274
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,875
Leave this train now
and no one will be hurt.

275
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:26,083
Oh, that sounds like fear talking,
Mr. Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

276
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,916
And we done already hurt a couple people.

277
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,833
You're just going to let us
get away Dred Scott free?

278
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,833
State your purpose, bastard.

279
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,750
Also, I'm not a bastard.

280
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,666
But you've got something we want.
We've got a soldier that you want.

281
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,083
Now, I suggest we make a peaceful trade
and everybody lives to see another day.

282
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,791
- Sound dandy?
- Just let the boy go.

283
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:46,750
Jake!

284
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,083
I'm okay, Pa!

285
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,333
That's just a flesh wound, sir.

286
00:30:56,416 --> 00:31:00,125
You got ten seconds to put your guns down
and open up this damn door,

287
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,916
or your little kin here shall perish.

288
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,125
Harm him further and I will kill every
last one of you godless sons of bitches.

289
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,083
Goddamn, Trudy.
You know I like my countdowns.

290
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,000
My apologies, sir.
My friend here doesn't like arithmetic.

291
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,958
Be that as it may, seven seconds.

292
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,541
Six.

293
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,458
- Lay down your rifles.
- Five.

294
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,625
I said lay them down.

295
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,541
Four.

296
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,916
Three.

297
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:46,333
Well, all right. Thank you kindly.
Go ahead and walk, boy.

298
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:52,041
Keep walkin'. Just keep moving.
No one do anything stupid.

299
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,500
Just walk like you been taught.

300
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:58,041
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.

301
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,083
Left, right, left.

302
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,750
- Open it.
- I can't.

303
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,708
The key is back in Yuma. And the next...

304
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,166
One more time.

305
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,958
You will be hounded
to the ends of the earth for this.

306
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:54,375
I don't like long distances,
Lieutenant General Abbott.

307
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,666
Ever cross your mind
why you was given the task

308
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,750
of transporting a lone outlaw
from one prison to another?

309
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:12,208
Full pardon for Mr. Buck
and all his associates for all misdeeds.

310
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,500
Signed General George Pryce.

311
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,833
What's this about?

312
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,708
Well, he came to us with a proposition.

313
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:28,333
Kill a particular
Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

314
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:34,291
A man so crooked that even the government
is embarrassed by his misdeeds.

315
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:39,166
Apparently, you and your men
wiped out an entire town,

316
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,833
women and children included,

317
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,791
to steal silver.

318
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,083
- Now, that's some unscrupulous shit.
- Unscrupulous shit.

319
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,333
Please. I'll dis...

320
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,375
Shh.

321
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,333
No!

322
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:57,833
Pa! No, no, no, no, no.

323
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,458
Pa.

324
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:00,791
No.

325
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,750
Who here can drive a train?

326
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,666
I said...

327
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,458
Everybody but him.

328
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,791
Evening, sir. Check your weapon with me
and enjoy what's left of the night.

329
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,750
Oh, no need to show me that star.
I know who you is.

330
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:40,958
In here, though, I be the sheriff,
and that make Ms. Mary the marshal.

331
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,666
And the marshal say,
"Don't nobody come in here gunned up,

332
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,458
or they might could get gunned down."

333
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,000
My badge begs to differ.

334
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,208
Check your gun-belt.

335
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,291
Excuse me.

336
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,375
So how you plan on taking me in, Marshal?

337
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:18,875
Staring me to death?

338
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,208
How about just death?

339
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,833
Just a pipe.

340
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,625
You mind?

341
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,000
Never known you to touch it.

342
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,708
Only after I kill a man.

343
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,000
Or before.

344
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,208
I was on the trail
of the Crimson Hood Gang

345
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,958
on account of a bank robbery
in Kansas City.

346
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,791
Turned out somebody got to 'em before me.

347
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,000
You know I don't rob banks, Marshal.

348
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,000
But you rob them that do,
which is all the same to me.

349
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,625
- Texas.
- What?

350
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,750
I was in Texas
at the time of that robbery.

351
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,125
How you know when it took place?

352
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,291
Whenever any bank robbery took place,
I was in Texas.

353
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,208
Unless, of course,
the robbery took place in Texas.

354
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,875
Way I hear it, some of them boys
with the Crimson Hoods

355
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:21,208
are part of a new Rufus Buck Gang, Nat.

356
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,208
Rufus in Yuma.

357
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,833
He out. But you knew that already,
didn't you?

358
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,125
Why you sitting here monologuing,
drinking up my whiskey,

359
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,541
when you should be out
rounding up your little deputies?

360
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,875
'Cause he been pardoned, Nat.

361
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,000
Rufus Buck been absolved
of his countless depredations.

362
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:44,833
Seeing as I've been scouring the terrain
looking for bank robbers and such,

363
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:50,250
that particular piece of news
failed to reach me.

364
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,375
What they sayin'?

365
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,833
Something about guns, killin'.

366
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,791
Why you let that kid take my gun?
What kinda stupid rule is that?

367
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,333
- Should be four guns pointing at...
- Shut up, Pickett.

368
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,000
You shoot, he dead.

369
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,500
You miss,

370
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,416
all y'all die.

371
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,791
You, come here.

372
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,583
Take these cuffs. Cuff this man.

373
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,875
Or I put three in his chest right now,
lessen the trouble.

374
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,166
Go on.

375
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,250
Tell this young buck to back up.

376
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,875
Easy, Jim.

377
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,708
Everybody in here know who I am.

378
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,541
I'm taking Nat Love
to Fort Smith to be tried.

379
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,083
Anybody try to follow me,

380
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,458
y'all know what I do.

381
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,416
Come on.

382
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,250
Y'all enjoy the rest of the evening.

383
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:17,750
Rufus.

384
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:24,916
Cherokee Bill, Ms. Smith,
top of the morning to you both.

385
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,583
Mr. Buck, glad to have you
back in Redwood, sir.

386
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,125
Any word on the take
from the Kansas City bank?

387
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:39,250
The Crimson Hoods took it for $25,000.

388
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,666
But they were ambushed
before they got here.

389
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,791
Everybody knows
it's suicide to take from us.

390
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,833
Someone obviously disagrees.

391
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,583
Goddamn it. That just put us
right back where we started.

392
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,833
How we supposed to build a Mecca
without any bricks?

393
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:59,083
We gonna have to
take it out of our own bank.

394
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,583
We don't have
that type of money, Trudy.

395
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,625
We only got a few pennies over $2,500.

396
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,750
What did he say?

397
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,541
- 2,500...
- I heard you.

398
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,958
- Wiley.
- Yeah.

399
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,166
Sure is hot, ain't it?

400
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,583
What's up, little man?

401
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,875
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah.

402
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,666
Watch this now.
Don't take your eyes off it.

403
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,708
Oh, it's still there!

404
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,583
Rufus Buck.

405
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,208
Look at you.

406
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:09,125
Relic of yesteryear with nothin'.

407
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,541
And you think you can roll into my town
and take what belong to me?

408
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,083
Who the fuck you think I am, huh?

409
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,166
Ain't nobody scared of you
and ain't nobody runnin'.

410
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,083
I'm a sinister motherfucker too.

411
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,958
One click of my finger and you disappear.

412
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,000
So I suggest you leave…

413
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,625
Before I finish my steak.

414
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:43,125
And if you even think about sticking...

415
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,916
Come in.

416
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,916
What is it, Carson?

417
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Sheriff, Mr. Buck wants
to see you out front.

418
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,041
Tell that man
I ain't got nothing to say to him.

419
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,291
It wasn't a request.

420
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:12,708
Wiley Escoe.

421
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,791
Rufus.

422
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,250
You wanna sell this town
while I rot in prison?

423
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,083
The world you knew is gone.

424
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,750
There's a flood comin'.

425
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,458
Do you think
you can hold onto this place when it hit?

426
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,500
At least I know enough
to get mine and get out.

427
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:36,416
Kill me…

428
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,208
And you'll have nothing.

429
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,958
You know, a man like you
will have us all subservient

430
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,875
till the end of our days

431
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,833
so's long as you can buy yourself a house,

432
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,000
a badge,

433
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,708
and them goddamn gold teeth.

434
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,666
You want to do this here?

435
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,750
There you go.
That's what you want, right?

436
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,916
That's what you came here for?

437
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,041
I won't disappoint you. Come on.

438
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,916
That's what you want. Want some more?

439
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,583
You want some more, right?
You want some more?

440
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,875
Come here, motherfucker.

441
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,333
Here you go.

442
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,083
Oh shit. I done hit gold.

443
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,916
Hey, boy. Come here.
Come, get that gold. Get that gold.

444
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,833
All right. Tell your mama
you rich now! Go ahead!

445
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,500
Now,
I ain't gonna kill you, Wiley.

446
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,791
You and I were friends once.

447
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,500
But know this.

448
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,750
Redwood will never be yours, never.

449
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,375
Never.

450
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,041
Matter of fact,
you ain't welcome here no more.

451
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,208
Now…

452
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:30,000
I want you to vacate immediately
or die where you lay.

453
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:33,833
Say what?

454
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:44,958
That's right.

455
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,833
You coulda taken these off a while back.

456
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,791
Yep.

457
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,916
Tell me something.
How you know Rufus will be in Redwood?

458
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,041
He's taking that money
from them Crimson Hoods.

459
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,541
That's where he'll be.

460
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:21,166
Now you teaming up
with a marshal to bring him in.

461
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,916
I ain't bringing him in.
I'm bringing him down.

462
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,666
And we ain't teaming up, old man.

463
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,333
Your life's expendable, Marshal.
My gang's ain't.

464
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:32,458
Shit, since we're out here,
I oughta tell you…

465
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,125
I was fixin' to kill you…

466
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,333
When you and your fellas brought in Rufus.

467
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,208
A lot of men be fixin', son.

468
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,166
They always seem to die
before they get the job done.

469
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,041
Just for the record…

470
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,291
I took Rufus in alone.

471
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,291
Mary.

472
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,000
I figured you'd be halfway
to Fort Smith by now.

473
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,500
You can put that gun down, Marshal.
This ain't a ambush.

474
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,791
You, on the other hand,
might wanna keep yours handy.

475
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,791
Do you think I'm stupid enough

476
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:32,583
to fall for that bullshit
y'all pulled in my saloon?

477
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,458
I don't want you mixed up in this no more.

478
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,750
Then you shoulda told me so.

479
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,125
I must confess
to some raw feelings myself.

480
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,500
This ain't no road
to ask a friend to travel.

481
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,583
Now you take that money
we took off them Crimson Hoods

482
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,958
and you buy that ranch
you always blabbing about. Hmm?

483
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,541
That's mighty generous of you,
but that ain't how this gang work.

484
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:56,000
Take stays in the usual place, ready
to be shared three ways when we come back.

485
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,958
Ain't no coming back from this.

486
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,875
Now get out of here.

487
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,375
All of you. This ain't your fight.

488
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:06,416
You take on the Devil himself, you gonna
need more than you and the marshal.

489
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,458
I seen the Devil,
and Rufus Buck ain't him.

490
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:11,583
Devil's white.

491
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,125
You got a reason you wanna die, Jim?

492
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,041
Outside of you saving me from this?

493
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:23,416
Besides, Monroe said
Cherokee Bill run with Rufus.

494
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:25,541
Every time I speak on my speed,

495
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:28,333
a motherfucker wanna pull
Cherokee Bill out they ass.

496
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,666
I'ma put a end to that argument
once and for all.

497
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,166
Like they say in the <i>Book of Clarence,</i>
"No man out-speed me."

498
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,291
Out-speed ain't a word,
and Clarence ain't no book.

499
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,916
I'm hopin' Cherokee put a bullet
in your ass just to shut you up.

500
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,125
- Hey.
- You left these on my wall, Mr. Love.

501
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,708
Figured we going after villains,
you'll need 'em.

502
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:44,750
Obliged.

503
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,458
What y'all waiting around for?

504
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,958
You think destiny is comin' to you?

505
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,916
Hyup! Go!

506
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,875
Yeah. I know.

507
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,458
Go ahead.

508
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,541
How do I look?

509
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,541
All right.

510
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,625
Everybody out there?

511
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,166
Just about.

512
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,250
How could you do it?

513
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,166
Leave all of this to Wiley?

514
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,208
If you were runnin' Redwood,

515
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,416
who woulda kept the operation goin'?

516
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,166
Who else woulda kept
all them gangs in line?

517
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:54,250
Look, I know that Wiley got his ways,
but he was loyal once.

518
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,083
Loyalty is a virtue, Rufus.

519
00:54:59,041 --> 00:54:59,958
Till it ain't.

520
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,875
You loyal to me?

521
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,500
See these folk here?

522
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,458
Either they can't see it
or they don't want to.

523
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,416
But I believe in what you're doing.

524
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,833
This place can be
the promised land for us.

525
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,125
And as long as that so, ain't nothing
I won't do to see it through.

526
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,041
You tell them.

527
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,916
Citizens of Redwood.

528
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,166
A new day is dawning.

529
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,416
As by now you have doubtless learned,

530
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,291
the territory will officially
open up for settlement.

531
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,625
Now they say everything we own
is gonna stay our own.

532
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,000
But you know as well as I do
how much that's worth.

533
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,375
See, your land,
your businesses, your homes

534
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,333
has all been promised
to the highest bidders

535
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,875
by your one-time sheriff, Wiley Escoe.

536
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,333
Now, Mr. Buck can prevent this
from happening.

537
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,958
But in order for us to do that,
it's necessary that we levy a tax.

538
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,708
At what cost to us?

539
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,916
- $50,000.
- Ooh.

540
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,583
You could scrape every penny
from every living soul in this town,

541
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,416
and it wouldn't come near to that.

542
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,250
You got us between a rock
and a hard place.

543
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,958
How long you been alive in this country?

544
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,750
A rock and a hard place
is what we call Monday.

545
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,166
I've heard of Rufus Buck.

546
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,458
How bad a man he is.

547
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,583
But he got himself
thrown in jail once before,

548
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,041
and I reckon
he'll be back there again soon enough.

549
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:21,375
When he is,
maybe I'll come back to this town.

550
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,583
'Cause I ain't paying shit.

551
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,458
You think I made Redwood for myself?

552
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,250
To what end?

553
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,791
Redwood ain't a hiding place,
'cause I don't hide.

554
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,291
It ain't a dream.

555
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:40,875
I don't dream.

556
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,500
You know what it is?

557
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,125
It's an example.

558
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,666
It's an example…

559
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,291
For others to follow.

560
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,250
And you…

561
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:01,125
You are an enemy of progress.

562
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,875
Please. Please.

563
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,916
- I got a family.
- What's your name?

564
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,708
James.

565
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,041
Rest in peace, James.

566
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,708
Now, how much?

567
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:30,625
How much can be gathered?

568
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,708
Ten thousand.

569
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,666
Maybe 15,
if every last cent can be squeezed.

570
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,625
Mmm-hmm.

571
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,541
Ain't nobody leave town
until we collect it all.

572
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,333
And if you fail to comply,

573
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,833
you and everything you love will burn.

574
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,500
I ain't got nothin' to rob.

575
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,958
But I got somebody to shoot.

576
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,333
Step down.

577
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,208
Wiley Escoe.

578
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,083
Bass Reeves.

579
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:28,708
Fuck.

580
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,166
Redwood crawling with gunmen.

581
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,916
Rufus came with 12 and took six of mine.

582
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,708
Who knows how many he got by now.

583
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:38,166
I don't believe a thing this man sayin'.

584
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,500
He a scout.

585
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:41,625
I say we kill him.

586
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,250
And we take the rest of them teeth.

587
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,583
You ever shot a sheriff, boy?

588
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,333
A mayor?

589
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,708
Little harder than shootin' regular folk.

590
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
And I'm both.

591
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:57,708
You both alive and dead
'cause Rufus don't like loose ends.

592
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:02,291
Law don't find a man like Rufus Buck
unless you got inside information.

593
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,583
Ain't that right, Wiley?

594
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,166
If I had my way, you'd be right up
under the jail next to Rufus.

595
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,666
But you cut yourself a deal,
wound up wearing a badge instead.

596
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,291
You got your reasons
you want Rufus gone, and I got mine.

597
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,041
Ain't the enemy of my enemy my friend?

598
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,541
Rufus tryin' to save Redwood.
But for that, he need money.

599
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,791
And that's one thing he ain't have.

600
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:27,541
All right, look here.
You made a deal with the Devil.

601
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,583
Now he come to collect.

602
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,583
You rest up,

603
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,500
but be gone before sunup.

604
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,666
Or it's gonna go from bad to badder.
You hear?

605
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:58,708
Ooh.

606
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,458
Marshal.

607
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,500
Marshal. Marshal.

608
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,416
All them tricks'll get you killed, son.

609
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,375
Listen, Marshal.

610
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:16,125
I'm faster than any weapon.
You can trust in that.

611
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,375
I seen faster.

612
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:21,083
All right. Where?

613
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:22,916
In the mirror.

614
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,541
Negro said, "In the mirror."

615
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:29,791
I'm so… I'm sorry.

616
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:33,791
I rather ride into a gun battle
on a dark horse over a golden stallion.

617
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,625
- Fuck that mean?
- Shiny shit get shot.

618
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:40,750
You gonna shoot me?

619
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,625
What you think about that, lawman?

620
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,125
I think y'all gonna die.

621
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,791
I'll be back with information by sunup.

622
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,583
Information from where?

623
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:37,916
Redwood.

624
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,500
You know we can't trust Wiley's word.

625
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,250
Someone's got to get the lay of the land
before we make our next move.

626
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,500
Yeah, Mary, but that somebody
ain't got to be you.

627
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,708
Every gunhand
in the territory's gonna recognize you

628
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,375
the second you hop off your horse.

629
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:53,958
Same with Bill and Beckwourth.

630
01:02:54,041 --> 01:02:55,875
In case you forgot,

631
01:02:55,958 --> 01:03:00,166
your face more famous than all of ours
put together, Stagecoach Mary.

632
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,833
Got it up on advertisements
for that saloon of yours

633
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:03,958
from here to Texas.

634
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,416
Which is why I can
ride into town in plain sight.

635
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,666
Everybody knows I'm buying saloons.

636
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,583
Rufus need money. I'ma make him an offer
on Trudy Smith's place...

637
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:16,416
Mary, what in my character
makes you think I'll allow that?

638
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,666
I'm not asking for your permission.

639
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,000
All right.

640
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,708
Then I… I guess
I'll just be asking you for yours.

641
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,750
Since you'll never let
a man give you away,

642
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,291
I just have to ask you direct.

643
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,875
That's the ring my father gave my mother.

644
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,125
I was gonna give it to you
back in Douglas.

645
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,041
But you didn't.

646
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:00,250
I am now.

647
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,958
I used to hate feeling helpless over you.

648
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,625
Those days are over now.

649
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,583
Mary…

650
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,333
When the dust settles,
we gonna go our separate ways, for good.

651
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:25,000
But not till the dust settles.
I'm here till then.

652
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,208
See you sunup.

653
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,208
Whoa.

654
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,375
Are you a resident of Redwood, ma'am?

655
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,958
You don't own a gun
confident enough to ask where I reside.

656
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:51,291
{\an8}Well, this gun say
answer the damn question.

657
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,208
Well, this gun don't talk.

658
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:05,416
Stagecoach Mary.

659
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,833
Ghastly Gertrude Smith.

660
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,375
I prefer Treacherous Trudy myself,
but I'll take it.

661
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,541
What brings you to my town?

662
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,708
I heard Rufus Buck was back.

663
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,291
News travels fast.

664
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,541
I have an offer he might wanna hear about.

665
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,375
Well, any offer you got,

666
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,375
you can make it to me.

667
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,166
I don't do business with the help.

668
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,541
Give me that shit.

669
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:51,708
Lead the way, Treacherous Trudy.

670
01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,291
Speak your piece.

671
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,375
I assume you know who I am.

672
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,458
I assume you know who I used to run with.

673
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:47,166
Those days are over for me anyhow,

674
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,583
but I didn't get to be
Stagecoach Mary Fields

675
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:54,166
without having my ears to the ground

676
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:58,333
and my ears tell me you just lost
25 thou that was coming your way.

677
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,583
I hope your proposal
rivals your nerve...

678
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,250
Allow me the latitude of completion.

679
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,166
My saloon in Douglas is boomin'.

680
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:14,875
Bought me another one in the Elks,
and I got a restaurant in Cascade too.

681
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:18,083
For the sum of all that,
I could take this one off your hands.

682
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,958
The mere mention of my name
brings forth good business

683
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,833
to any establishment attached, whereas,

684
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:32,833
with all due respect,
but the name Rufus Buck instils fear.

685
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,041
We know who you are.

686
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:48,666
You walkin' into my town
with that proposal is risky.

687
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:54,083
The kind of risk a woman such as yourself
wouldn't tie herself to

688
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,291
unless there was
a whole lot more at stake.

689
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:00,958
See, I don't believe in coincidence,

690
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,083
like you just gonna walk in here

691
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,708
right after the Crimson Hoods
get ambushed with my money.

692
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,208
What are you thinking?

693
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:16,666
Oops.

694
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,416
You must have forgot
whose name is on the door.

695
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:22,875
Another round.

696
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,916
We havin' a party, y'all. Come on.

697
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:13,541
All right, Mary.

698
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:16,541
All right.

699
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,958
So you still sayin'
you don't know nothin' about that money

700
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,500
and you done come here alone?

701
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,916
That's right.

702
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:31,041
You done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed.

703
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:32,875
And for what?

704
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:34,708
For love?

705
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,166
Love is the only thing worth dying for.

706
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,125
But you wouldn't know anything about that.

707
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,083
You know,

708
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:52,166
I had a sister named Mary.

709
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:03,291
She was pretty, strong-willed, like you.

710
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,375
She died of polio when I was 11.

711
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,958
Always was in pain,
but she'd never let me see her cry.

712
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:14,750
Mmm.

713
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,750
There's this girl called Hope lived by us.

714
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,083
Big fat kid,
always picking on the smaller kids.

715
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,625
Obviously out of jealousy.

716
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,666
But she ain't never fuck with me though.

717
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,416
She hated Mary with a passion,

718
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,583
always teasing her
about how thin and frail she was.

719
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,083
Then one day,

720
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,583
Hope walkin' by our house,

721
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,000
apple in one hand, blade in the other.

722
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:54,083
She decided to throw the apple
across the street at Mary,

723
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:59,208
and it hit my sister in the head
and knocked her out of balance.

724
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,875
She fell down the steps.

725
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,291
Broke her ankle.

726
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
And now that…

727
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:11,666
That was the first and only time
I physically seen my sister cry.

728
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:17,791
And there was Hope standing there
laughin' her ugly fuckin' face off.

729
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:22,833
My daddy…

730
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,333
He got home,

731
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:34,041
he took off his belt, and he beat <i>me</i>
for not protecting my sister.

732
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,208
He lashed me
until my whole body went numb.

733
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,083
Then

734
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:47,125
he went to Hope house
to do the same thing to her.

735
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:54,166
When he got there, he saw her whole family
standin' on the side of the house,

736
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,583
all of 'em screamin' and cryin',

737
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,958
and there was Hope…

738
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,458
Iyin' on the floor in a pool of blood.

739
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,208
Somebody had slit her throat.

740
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,125
Killed her with her own knife.

741
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:19,041
Daddy was speechless.

742
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:22,708
He ain't said a word to me
when he came home.

743
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,458
The next day,

744
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,791
he sent me to live with my grandparents.

745
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,875
And then the next time I seen my sister,

746
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,208
she was laying in a coffin.

747
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,875
Disease had killed her.

748
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,458
I'm sorry your sister had to suffer.

749
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,666
I admire her bravery.

750
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,625
But you get no words from me.

751
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,541
You know,

752
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,958
I actually admire <i>your</i> bravery.

753
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,666
But I'm afraid the outcome
is still the outcome.

754
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:17,625
Hope

755
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,875
must die.

756
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,166
But not yet.

757
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,541
Leave her out here in the street
so everybody can see her.

758
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:55,833
No one come to collect her 'fore sunup,
put a bullet in her head.

759
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,916
Yes, ma'am.

760
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,458
Looks like we don't
have to wait that long.

761
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,541
Whoever die first, right?

762
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,125
- Whoever die first.
- Mmm-hmm.

763
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:43,916
Get her up.

764
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,500
"Whoever die first"?

765
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,291
Now, what kind of dumb-ass saying is that?

766
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,666
You two trying to get shot out here?

767
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,166
Nat Love. How predictable.

768
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:02,708
You predict my friend Bill Pickett
aiming at your bowler cap?

769
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,333
You'll be dead
before your boys get their aim.

770
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,000
And you die right after.

771
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,375
But your boss won't see
one red cent of that money.

772
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,208
My boss?

773
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,250
Where is he?

774
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,000
Where is who?

775
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,375
Marshal.

776
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,375
I'm speakin' English, yeah?

777
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,541
- Sound like English to me.
- Mmm-hmm.

778
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,208
Where's Rufus Buck?

779
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:29,875
Oh.

780
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:31,583
Ooh-hoo.

781
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,708
Bass.

782
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,333
Trudy.

783
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:40,958
If I'd known you were switchin' sides,
I'da asked you to come join us.

784
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,500
You here for your damsel in distress?

785
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,958
You don't look hard of hearing.

786
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,583
So I'ma ask you again.

787
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,666
Where's Rufus Buck?

788
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,333
Well, clearly, you don't know me.

789
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,125
Tell your men to go,

790
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,625
but you stay,

791
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,541
and maybe your damsel
will live a little longer.

792
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,708
Marshal.

793
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:37,500
Oh.

794
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,458
You're pretty though.

795
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,500
- Ah, take her ass back in there.
- Yes, ma'am.

796
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,083
Gonna get me a drink.

797
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,000
Hey.

798
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,875
That the quick draw
I hear tell about, Cherokee Bill?

799
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,041
I hear you so fast
that your opponents ain't got time to draw

800
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,666
before you put two in they back.

801
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,583
No, that ain't me.

802
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,083
I'm the Cherokee Bill that shoots men
in the mouth that talk too much.

803
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,500
I'll make it easy for you, then.

804
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,791
You draw first.

805
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,750
That what you think this is?
"Who the quickest draw in the West?"

806
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,750
All comes down
to who fast and who ain't, right?

807
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,333
No, it all comes down
to who's alive and who's dead.

808
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,208
Trudy, I'm gonna get me
something to drink.

809
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,708
Good night.

810
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:31,708
Hey, hey, drink, my ass, man.

811
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,750
- I practiced that standoff all night.
- Jim.

812
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:36,208
- You're not about to walk away.
- Get out of here.

813
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,916
- No, nobody...
- Get out of here, Jim.

814
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
- That chicken...
- It ain't the time.

815
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,541
Okay. Okay.

816
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,083
March, boy.

817
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,833
- I said march!
- March.

818
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,750
Hup, two, three, four.

819
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,416
That's enough.

820
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:43,750
They beat you bad?

821
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,791
I'ma kill 'em all.

822
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,416
You familiar with Napoleon?

823
01:21:56,583 --> 01:22:00,166
He said, "I am driven towards an end
that I do not know."

824
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,625
"As I reach it,

825
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:05,416
as I shall become unnecessary,

826
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:09,625
an atom shall suffice to shatter me."

827
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:15,708
"Until then, all forces of humankind
can do nothing to stop me."

828
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,333
That's a man who knew exactly who he was.

829
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,083
Most importantly,

830
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,750
he knew that
his time would come to an end.

831
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:31,541
Cut him down.

832
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,208
You know why…

833
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,791
I gave you that scar?

834
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,291
So I'd remember you.

835
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,250
No.

836
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:59,833
No, I gave you that scar so I can know
your face when you come back to me.

837
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,000
Nat Love,

838
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,500
the outlaw who robs outlaws,

839
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:14,500
the angel of death who hunts down those
who trespass against him with no mercy.

840
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,041
I know who you are.

841
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,000
And I see the line that you won't cross.

842
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,375
See, I know what's on the other side.

843
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,166
Apologize for the beating.

844
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,958
It was more of an indication
for what Ms. Fields might see

845
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,333
if we fail to come to terms.

846
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,291
What terms?

847
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:47,250
You will return the money
you stole from me by Friday noon.

848
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,625
Not a moment later.

849
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,083
And you will add $10,000 on top of that.
We'll call that interest.

850
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,166
Somethin' funny?

851
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,291
Ooh, shit, how…
how you reckon I'ma get that?

852
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,125
You're gonna rob a bank.

853
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,125
Nat Love is gonna rob a bank.

854
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:12,083
In the meantime, here's a little token
of my appreciation in advance.

855
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,083
Go ahead, open it.

856
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,125
I expect my money on Friday.

857
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,166
All of it.

858
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,416
You know I can't let you do that.

859
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,666
If that money ain't in Rufus' hands
in three days, Mary'll die.

860
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,791
What bank
we talking about anyway?

861
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,708
Maysville.

862
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,875
Maysville?

863
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,000
That's a white town.

864
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,416
Yeah, which is why
they gonna have $10,000 in their bank.

865
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,041
It's crazy.

866
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,041
My emotions
are all types of confused.

867
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,291
I mean, Pickett, I agree. That's crazy.

868
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,916
But, Nat, I also agree with you
telling the marshal

869
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,791
that we gonna do that shit anyways.

870
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,916
That's some true outlaw shit.

871
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,083
- We outlaws, ain't we?
- Ain't no "we," Jim.

872
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,666
Not after that shit you pulled in town
nearly got us all killed.

873
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,583
I had that.

874
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,750
Fetch that money
you took from the Crimson Hoods.

875
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,250
Pickett, kid, you comin' with me.

876
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,875
If Rufus Buck want that bank took,
why don't he send his own men?

877
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,625
This way he clean, see?

878
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,291
I gotta go in barefaced as day,

879
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:02,791
a freshly minted bank robber, face up
on wanted posters all over the territory.

880
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,458
They'll be on you like flies on shit
before you open the door.

881
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,625
Yep.

882
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,833
I said <i>I</i> had to be recognized.

883
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:14,041
Go ahead.

884
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,958
Hell no.

885
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,083
For Mary.

886
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:02,375
Whoo! Hoo!

887
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,291
Close shave.

888
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:05,708
Close fucking shave!

889
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:07,958
I thought I was
falling for a fella for a little bit.

890
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,500
That's why I didn't say nothing.

891
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,916
Well, I ain't the only one. I can't…

892
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,250
I can't… It wasn't just me.
It wasn't just me.

893
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:15,791
It was just you, Jim.

894
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,000
Giddup now.

895
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:19,166
Allow me.

896
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,583
What's your real name?

897
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,750
Cuffee my real name.

898
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,625
Name I was born with?

899
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,875
Cathay Williams.

900
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:51,166
You walk worse than you ride, Cathay.

901
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,750
Mr. Love, my momma always told me
to respect my elders,

902
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,583
so I'm not gonna say what I'm thinking.

903
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,583
That's all right. I can read your mind.

904
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,166
Then I'm sorry you had to hear that.

905
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,458
Go ahead.

906
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,333
Go ahead, honey.

907
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:38,750
Yes?

908
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,375
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

909
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:51,250
Ooh.

910
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:57,375
What…

911
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,541
You have to have an account, ma'am.

912
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:07,208
And, well, I'd recommend a bank
in Jericho or maybe Redwood for that.

913
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:08,375
Oh.

914
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,666
I'm not talking about
that kinda withdrawal.

915
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,375
I'm talk...

916
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:16,166
I'm talking about…

917
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,333
Talking about that kind.

918
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,375
Hey, blue eyes.

919
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,416
You scared.

920
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:45,791
Your hand is shaking. You'll miss.

921
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:47,958
I won't.

922
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:54,500
Exhale.

923
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,916
Attaboy.

924
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:12,875
I ain't like my partner.

925
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:16,833
He don't wanna shoot nobody,
but all of a sudden, I'm of a mind to.

926
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:19,541
Now open the fuckin' gate.

927
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,541
Think I'm funny now?

928
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,208
What you lookin' at?

929
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:30,666
Get all the customers over there.

930
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,375
- Get 'em over there!
- Okay, okay.

931
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:35,083
- Everyone, please, this way quickly.
- You too. Move!

932
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:42,625
Times have changed, ain't they?

933
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:53,375
They say robbing banks is hard work.

934
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,833
That's a lie. Robbing banks is easy.

935
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:01,333
The hard part is doing it without killing.

936
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:04,416
So, what'll it be…

937
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:08,416
Mr. Manager?

938
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:17,000
Good man.

939
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,625
Come on. Let's go.

940
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,791
Come on. Giddyap. Go.

941
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,375
Come on, come on.

942
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:37,958
- Pleasure banking with you.
- Okay, sir.

943
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,875
Nat Love.

944
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,125
Don't even look like much.

945
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:16,000
Ain't what it look like.
It's what it can buy you.

946
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:19,416
Rufus won't let Mary go
once he gets that money.

947
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:21,416
Yeah, I know it.

948
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:25,791
He'll kill her,
let me go, so's I carry that hurt with me.

949
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,208
So what, we just went through
all that trouble for nothin'?

950
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,791
Now we got something he want.

951
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:34,583
And that's it?

952
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,958
Gonna have to be.

953
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:43,000
You can be all hasty
and shoot me now if you want,

954
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:46,208
or you can wait to see
what I brought with me first.

955
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,791
Ooh.

956
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,791
Rufus got stashes like this
all across these hills.

957
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,916
Enough for a small army.

958
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,000
Don't nobody take what I got coming to me.

959
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,083
Not even the Devil himself.

960
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,791
Rufus Buck is a man.

961
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,208
Y'all best reconcile yourselves
with that fact.

962
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,125
Man or devil,

963
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,208
this gonna be
Buck's last day amongst the living.

964
01:35:43,416 --> 01:35:45,666
Whoa there, whoa there. Whoa.

965
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:20,666
Afternoon.

966
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:24,166
I would ask you to run
go fetch your superior,

967
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:27,125
but that'd be like asking you
to run go fetch your daddy.

968
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,375
It could be anybody, right?

969
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,375
Hmm.

970
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:31,791
You know,

971
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:34,875
I'm willing to bet my right arm

972
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,125
I've got a higher body count than yours.

973
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,875
That'd be a bad bet, son.

974
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:46,833
I fancy that song or whatever it was
you was whistling there.

975
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,958
Go, Jerry. Go.

976
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,583
That our money?

977
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:57,500
Uh…

978
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,333
Walk with me.

979
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:03,208
Hey, just… just walk with me.

980
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:06,000
- Keep an eye on this, Angel.
- Mmm-hmm.

981
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:30,500
You know they call your boss
the Devil hisself?

982
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,750
Even the Devil needed money, right?

983
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:40,625
So being as how we are
in possession of that money…

984
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:46,166
let me dictate the terms of engagement.

985
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:02,333
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that, old man?

986
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:05,250
Is that the right arm or the left?

987
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:09,041
Oh man.

988
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,208
Well, now there's us…

989
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,166
And there's y'all.

990
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,416
Whoa.

991
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

992
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,291
You get a hold of your feisty buddy here.

993
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:35,250
You got a little rowdy rascal.

994
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,375
- Mary.
- Yeah, we'll get to that.

995
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,833
- We gonna count this first.
- Now, Cherokee.

996
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:45,333
Or your boss gonna be
one quick draw and $35,000 short.

997
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,333
All right.

998
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,041
Unhitch this horse so's Mary can ride out.

999
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:32,291
- You always move so slow?
- You always talk so much?

1000
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,500
Really?

1001
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,625
In the back?

1002
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:54,875
What you think, Beckwourth?

1003
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:58,000
Nah, he wouldn't do that

1004
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:01,333
'cause then I would have to put
a bullet in his cranium.

1005
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:04,250
And we'll never know
who the fastest really is now, will we?

1006
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:11,166
I gotta hand it to you, boy.

1007
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,833
You do know how to make a grand entrance.

1008
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,958
Shit, I didn't even rehearse that one.

1009
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:21,083
You know, quick draw,

1010
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,708
Nat Love is a dead man walking.

1011
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,000
But you don't have to be.

1012
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Why don't you get on your horse,
get your shit,

1013
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,583
and go back to
whatever it is you call home?

1014
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,833
You know that's impossible.

1015
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,125
Count down from five?

1016
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:56,708
Five…

1017
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:15,375
Four…

1018
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:30,291
Three…

1019
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:41,083
Why do they always have to count so slow?

1020
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,458
Jim!

1021
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,083
Blow that bitch, Bill!

1022
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:47,625
Kill her.

1023
01:45:41,208 --> 01:45:42,333
Mary!

1024
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:56,125
Push!

1025
01:46:02,166 --> 01:46:03,041
Trudy's mine.

1026
01:46:22,291 --> 01:46:26,000
<i>We gonna play for you
our first tune tonight.</i>

1027
01:46:27,083 --> 01:46:29,708
<i>And the first tune is called…</i>

1028
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:34,375
<i>O I'oun t'awa se n'yara. Je k'abere</i>

1029
01:46:35,625 --> 01:46:36,666
<i>Which means,</i>

1030
01:46:38,541 --> 01:46:42,458
<i>"Let's start what we have come
into the room to do."</i>

1031
01:46:42,541 --> 01:46:43,416
Let's go.

1032
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:05,666
Son of a bitch!

1033
01:50:22,416 --> 01:50:24,541
Exhale, motherfucker.

1034
01:50:33,625 --> 01:50:34,458
Come on.

1035
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:58,958
- Where'd they get you?
- Shoulder. Get down!

1036
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:05,541
Matches.

1037
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:07,375
You wanna smoke now?

1038
01:51:08,166 --> 01:51:09,000
Matches, Bass.

1039
01:51:13,166 --> 01:51:14,458
Okay.

1040
01:51:25,666 --> 01:51:27,708
Jump, motherfuckers.

1041
01:51:35,333 --> 01:51:36,208
Fuck it.

1042
01:51:52,333 --> 01:51:54,041
I always knew it was you

1043
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:55,916
who gave me up.

1044
01:51:59,875 --> 01:52:01,041
God knew my heart.

1045
01:52:09,625 --> 01:52:10,666
Goodbye, old friend.

1046
01:52:11,708 --> 01:52:13,250
Rufus, I didn't have a choice...

1047
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:28,208
I told that kid.

1048
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:31,500
Them damn tricks…

1049
01:53:52,541 --> 01:53:54,416
Sorry, ladies.

1050
01:53:56,083 --> 01:53:58,291
- You all right, Cuffee?
- Just need to reload.

1051
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,333
You look hurt, Mr. Pickett.

1052
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:03,916
Ain't nothing but a flesh wound.
Maggie ain't ready for me today.

1053
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,125
Huh?

1054
01:54:05,708 --> 01:54:06,833
What the fuck?

1055
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,375
I'll be damned.

1056
01:54:15,333 --> 01:54:16,583
Pickett!

1057
01:54:28,041 --> 01:54:30,291
Now, why you got
that look on your face?

1058
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:36,166
No. No, no, no, brother, no, no, no.

1059
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:38,333
Stop that. Don't do that.

1060
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:41,708
You had a choice.

1061
01:54:43,375 --> 01:54:44,875
You always got a choice.

1062
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:52,000
Being scared will only
give you bad karma in the afterlife.

1063
01:55:01,916 --> 01:55:04,250
He didn't even have a chance,
you son of a bitch!

1064
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:18,875
You gonna shoot me in the back too?
Or cheat the count?

1065
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:06,625
Beckwourth was faster.

1066
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:08,958
Look after my friend.

1067
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:23,541
Nat.

1068
01:57:26,958 --> 01:57:27,958
Don't miss.

1069
01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,666
Pick up your guns.

1070
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:22,416
I know what it is now.

1071
01:58:24,416 --> 01:58:25,708
It's the eyes.

1072
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,625
Pick 'em up, I said.

1073
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:32,166
Your father,

1074
01:58:34,458 --> 01:58:35,458
he was a good man?

1075
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:39,625
He was.

1076
01:58:42,333 --> 01:58:45,666
And my mother was a good woman
before you cut 'em down.

1077
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:50,000
Seems we had a different upbringing.

1078
01:58:52,166 --> 01:58:53,791
I don't care how you was raised.

1079
01:58:55,333 --> 01:58:57,541
Now pick up your guns and turn around.

1080
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:03,375
I used to watch my father
beat my mother to a pulp

1081
01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:05,208
if she overcooked his food.

1082
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:08,708
He cut her up real good
if she undercooked it too.

1083
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:15,708
One day, I decided to intervene,

1084
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:19,166
and he turned his wrath on me.

1085
01:59:23,541 --> 01:59:25,916
My father was not a good man.

1086
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,958
Not a good man. He was an outlaw.

1087
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,041
Robbin' banks…

1088
01:59:35,583 --> 01:59:36,750
He liked to drink.

1089
01:59:43,416 --> 01:59:46,583
My mother took a bottle
and cut him to protect me.

1090
01:59:49,625 --> 01:59:53,041
He lashed back at her,
and just like that, she was gone.

1091
01:59:56,333 --> 01:59:59,625
Then, like the coward he is,

1092
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,208
he took everything we had and left,

1093
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,791
leaving me with my…

1094
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:09,791
My mother.

1095
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:17,583
I was ten years old, you know…

1096
02:00:19,916 --> 02:00:21,833
About the same age you was…

1097
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:26,500
When I gave you that scar.

1098
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:33,041
I had to fend for myself,
but I became who I am,

1099
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:35,375
just like you.

1100
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:46,375
As I did, all I could ever think about is
wanting my father to pay for what he did.

1101
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:52,833
I searched for him for years and years,
and I could never find him.

1102
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:58,125
It's like he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

1103
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:03,416
I ain't stop though. I kept looking…

1104
02:01:07,208 --> 02:01:08,916
Until I did find him.

1105
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,541
One day…

1106
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:21,000
Io and behold,

1107
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:24,333
there he was,

1108
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:26,000
my father,

1109
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:28,458
a new man.

1110
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:31,291
He was clean now.

1111
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:34,333
Sober.

1112
02:01:37,291 --> 02:01:38,375
Man of God.

1113
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,625
Had a church.

1114
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:47,750
He had a pretty little wife.

1115
02:01:51,708 --> 02:01:53,125
And he had a son,

1116
02:01:55,166 --> 02:01:57,208
about the age of ten years old,

1117
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:01,125
whose eyes blazed like mine.

1118
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:03,541
You're lyin'.

1119
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,916
You're lyin'!

1120
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,541
Killing our father was retribution, but...

1121
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:14,791
<i>My</i> father!

1122
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:17,875
<i>My</i> mother!

1123
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:21,791
But it weren't enough.

1124
02:02:23,625 --> 02:02:24,750
Letting you live,

1125
02:02:25,583 --> 02:02:27,291
that was the true revenge.

1126
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:34,250
Every sin you made, every bank you robbed,
everybody you killed.

1127
02:02:35,291 --> 02:02:36,625
I mean, look at you.

1128
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:40,208
You everything he tried to run away from.

1129
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:43,250
Buck.

1130
02:02:47,083 --> 02:02:48,583
Changed his name to "Love."

1131
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:54,750
You a Buck.

1132
02:02:55,625 --> 02:02:56,500
You lyin'.

1133
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,583
Just like me.

1134
02:03:00,041 --> 02:03:01,208
Just like him.

1135
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:06,666
But you better.
You gonna surpass even me because…

1136
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:10,458
I couldn't kill my brother.

1137
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:14,541
Yet here you are about to kill yours.

1138
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:19,083
It's time to take your revenge,
Nathaniel Buck.

1139
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:25,166
Go on.

1140
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:31,416
- Nathaniel Buck.
- No.

1141
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:37,166
Take your revenge.

1142
02:03:40,208 --> 02:03:41,416
Nathaniel Buck.

1143
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,958
Take your goddamn revenge!

1144
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,791
You a Buck.

1145
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:52,125
Nathaniel Buck.

1146
02:03:55,833 --> 02:03:57,083
Nathaniel...

1147
02:06:17,541 --> 02:06:18,958
Is the Devil dead?

1148
02:06:23,625 --> 02:06:24,625
I don't know.

1149
02:07:01,666 --> 02:07:02,708
All right, fellas.

1150
02:07:09,083 --> 02:07:11,375
You sure the law gonna believe he's dead?

1151
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:13,416
I'm the law, Ms. Mary.

1152
02:07:15,333 --> 02:07:17,000
If I say a man dead, he dead.

1153
02:07:19,708 --> 02:07:20,541
And you?

1154
02:07:22,041 --> 02:07:23,500
You sure this what you want?

1155
02:07:25,708 --> 02:07:31,416
I always kinda wanted to be
a deputy, sheriff, marshal person.

1156
02:07:53,958 --> 02:07:55,416
What you lookin' at?

1157
02:07:57,666 --> 02:07:59,541
We got work to do, Mr. Love.

1158
02:08:00,625 --> 02:08:01,541
Hup.

1159
02:08:05,375 --> 02:08:06,208
Let's go.

1160
02:08:21,541 --> 02:08:22,541
All right.

1160
02:08:23,305 --> 02:09:23,547
