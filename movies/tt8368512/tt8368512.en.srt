3
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,260
The time of the imperialists

4
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,544
will soon come to an end.

5
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:33,060
They speak...

6
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:38,983
...speak as if they want to frighten us.

7
00:01:40,943 --> 00:01:44,363
But they only scare themselves.

8
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:47,199
They know...

9
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,452
...They know that our nuclear arsenal

10
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:54,623
is only getting stronger every day.

11
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,211
And I have already said...

12
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:04,508
And I will say it again,

13
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,469
We... Will...

14
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:10,389
...bury them!

15
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,635
- Yeah, sure.
- Then what?

16
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:57,502
We can get tickets for something to see?

17
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,539
- We can see the symphony.
- Huh?

18
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,074
It'll finish really late.

19
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,076
We can catch the last train, huh?

20
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,492
Daddy, I got my pin.

21
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,244
I'm a Little Octobrist.

22
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:26,757
Wear it here...

23
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:29,927
by your heart.

24
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,572
I have to go out for a little while.

25
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:54,243
I won't wake you.

26
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,579
You can wake me.

27
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,746
Excuse me. Could you give me a light?

28
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,614
Yeah, sure.

29
00:04:16,782 --> 00:04:18,184
You're Americans, yes?

30
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,119
Yes, sir. We're on a summer trip.

31
00:04:22,688 --> 00:04:25,858
Please, take this to your embassy.

32
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,761
It is vital. I have no other way.

33
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:30,062
Come on. Let's get out of here.

34
00:04:30,096 --> 00:04:32,765
Do not go back to your hotel,
straight to the embassy.

35
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:35,134
Give this only to Deputy Chief of Mission.

36
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,936
Understand?

37
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,968
I'm an American citizen.

38
00:05:28,154 --> 00:05:29,587
- Thank you.
- Mm.

39
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,692
- Emily. Lovely as ever.
- Ah!

40
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,526
You do brighten up the old place.

41
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,493
Oh, thank you.

42
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:36,796
- Emily?
- Sir.

43
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:37,964
- Please sit down.
- Ah.

44
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,968
I've brought you boys a present.

45
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,712
Ah, thank you.

46
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,115
Rachel, step out.

47
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:04,790
I fear a nuclear war is coming

48
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:06,859
and I want to help you prevent it.

49
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,261
It's got my attention.

50
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:11,964
He's smart.

51
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:14,000
Gave us a photo only we'd have copies of

52
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,802
from a few years ago in
our embassy in Turkey.

53
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:22,742
Say hello to Colonel Oleg
Vladimirovich Penkovsky.

54
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,744
Code name "Ironbark".

55
00:06:24,777 --> 00:06:26,645
Artillery officer during the war,

56
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,546
decorated 13 times.

57
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:29,547
Now he's back in Moscow

58
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,917
running the State Committee
for Scientific Research.

59
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:33,618
But that's just a cover.

60
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:36,655
He's GRU.

61
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:43,095
Why they toss him?

62
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,898
Hand like this I keep place to my chest.

63
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,867
Because they have no way to make contact.

64
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,803
The CIA is weak in Moscow after that...

65
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,040
disaster with Popov. Am I right?

66
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:58,244
We're thin on the
ground. We need your help.

67
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:01,347
Let's get him out.

68
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:03,849
We've got a number of good
officers in our embassy.

69
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:05,985
I'll have one make contact with Penkovsky,

70
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:08,120
- get this sorted out.
- I did have a thought.

71
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,758
This is a GRU Colonel. He's so visible.

72
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,026
I'm worried we could blow Penkovsky

73
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,294
just by making an approach.

74
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:19,198
That's always a risk. What
would the CIA have us do instead?

75
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,200
I don't know.

76
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,071
Maybe use someone outside the embassy

77
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:28,007
who the KGB won't suspect?

78
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:31,877
Say a businessman who travels
to that part of the world.

79
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:35,948
Do we know of someone
who could fit the bill?

80
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:37,383
I have to warn you,

81
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,853
I have a pretty good feeling about this.

82
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:44,190
Oh, hell.

83
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,993
And Greville, that is the saddest thing

84
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:49,695
I've ever seen.

85
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,864
Well, serves me right,

86
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:53,966
I should keep my mouth shut.

87
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:56,235
Now we have to make it up.

88
00:07:57,736 --> 00:07:59,705
We probably have some brochures.

89
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:00,840
Of what?

90
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,374
A drink first, I think.

91
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,213
You know my reputation.

92
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:09,348
Parts I want you to know anyway.

93
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:12,084
I represent the top manufacturers

94
00:08:12,118 --> 00:08:14,186
who sell the best products on the market.

95
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,389
So in combination with you
gentlemen knowing your business,

96
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:18,791
I think it'd be much better if

97
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:20,159
instead of my usual song and dance.

98
00:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,162
I just listen. You tell
me what your problems are,

99
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,298
and if I think I have a client
that may have a solution,

100
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:30,136
let's talk it through. If
not, let's keep drinking.

101
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,905
So tell me, what do you need?

102
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:35,741
- Thanks, Greville.
- Bye.

103
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:08,941
It still doesn't add up.

104
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:11,243
Well, did you miss something maybe?

105
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,980
- Like carrying the four?
- Oh, yes.

106
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,782
- Oh, yes.
- How are you?

107
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:19,852
Oh, very well. Except
our son keeps confusing me

108
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:22,087
helping with his homework
with me doing it for him.

109
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:22,821
Oh.

110
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:25,090
- How was your day?
- Oh, the usual.

111
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:27,459
Some empty flatteries
and blatant sucking up.

112
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,128
No, really, you should have seen me.

113
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:32,031
I sold a dozen lace by
throwing the easiest putt

114
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:33,332
in the history of putting.

115
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,167
- I feel filthy.
- No. No.

116
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:36,702
You have to play golf badly.

117
00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:39,104
- But aren't you used to that?
- Uh-huh!

118
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:41,440
Well, just think another 23 years of this

119
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,942
and then we're off to the good life.

120
00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:45,211
Or I could retire early.

121
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,880
Andrew, you don't want to
go to university, do you?

122
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,315
Not really.

123
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,849
- Perfect.
- Well, I'm not feeding

124
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,051
either of you.

125
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,485
Then what you're smiling at?

126
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,454
Be at least 50 years until you can retire.

127
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,990
- <i>Greville Wynne, please?</i>
- Yeah. Let me see if he's home.

128
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:02,194
- Sounds like work.
- No. Tell them I'm in my chair.

129
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,830
Yes. He's just walked in.

130
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,440
- Greville Wynne.
- <i>Greville, this is James Dobie</i>

131
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,809
<i>from the Board of
Trade. We met last year.</i>

132
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,777
Yes. Yes. At the reception of Whitehall.

133
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,846
James. How good to hear from you.

134
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,948
- James, hello.
- Greville.

135
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:24,850
I hope you don't mind.

136
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:27,886
My friend Helen is a
consultant in from the States.

137
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,255
I thought, "Why not?"

138
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,457
Greville Wynne. A real pleasure.

139
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,259
Helen Talbot, likewise.

140
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:38,030
James tells me you've been
working in Eastern Europe.

141
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:40,833
Hmm. More and more,
tremendous opportunities.

142
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,102
Plenty of demand, no local supplies.

143
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:46,238
Czechoslovakia, Hungary.

144
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:49,108
Ghastly food.

145
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:51,277
What about the Soviet Union?

146
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,945
Oh, not just yet. Someday.

147
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,281
I'd like to see temperatures
cool off a bit first.

148
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:57,049
Actually now might be the perfect time.

149
00:10:57,249 --> 00:10:59,018
Oh, really? Why? What did you hear?

150
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,053
Well, Helen and I have associates

151
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:03,289
who would be interested to
see what might come of it.

152
00:11:05,524 --> 00:11:07,493
It would be a real
service to Great Britain.

153
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:09,862
And the world.

154
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,080
Forgive me. I'm just a bit...

155
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,185
Sorry. James, I know you said you had

156
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:35,054
an office in Board of Trade.

157
00:11:36,088 --> 00:11:37,189
But...

158
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,958
Is it possible that you actually work...

159
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:43,329
at a different branch of
Her Majesty's government?

160
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:48,534
Oh, my.

161
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:52,838
This is unexpected.

162
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,975
Sorry, I... I don't understand.

163
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,945
Why, I'm... I'm... I'm just a salesman.

164
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:02,581
Exactly. An ordinary salesman

165
00:12:02,614 --> 00:12:04,450
with no connection to the government.

166
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,585
Look, this is all fascinating.
I mean, I really can't believe

167
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:10,122
I'm actually having lunch with spies.

168
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,224
But...

169
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,161
...I couldn't possibly...

170
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:24,103
- What would you want me to do?
- Nothing dodgy, nothing illegal,

171
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,871
just what you would naturally do.

172
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:27,373
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

173
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,174
Someone in your field

174
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:31,644
hoping to do business in the Soviet Union,

175
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,379
how would you get started?

176
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,148
Well, I suppose I'd set up

177
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:37,950
a meeting with the State Committee

178
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:40,018
for Scientific Research in Moscow.

179
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:42,054
That sounds fine.

180
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:46,325
So you want me to go to Moscow and then...

181
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,261
Do business.

182
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:55,100
All this secrecy must seem absurd

183
00:12:55,134 --> 00:12:56,502
but I promise, it's to help you.

184
00:12:56,535 --> 00:12:58,137
We want you to act exactly like

185
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,071
the ordinary businessman you are.

186
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:01,507
That'll be much easier if
you don't know any details.

187
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,375
Right. But would I be
putting myself in danger?

188
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,043
That detail, I... I have to know.

189
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,146
Greville, let me put this delicately,

190
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:08,347
you're a middle-aged businessman

191
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,651
who drinks a bit too much and
isn't exactly in top shape.

192
00:13:11,684 --> 00:13:13,118
During the war, you were a private,

193
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:14,687
never even saw combat.

194
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:18,524
My point is, if this mission
was the least bit dangerous,

195
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:21,093
you really are the last man we'd send.

196
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:24,363
Well, thank you for
putting it so delicately.

197
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:31,336
Make sure you wear it
while you're in Moscow.

198
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,940
What does this do? Shoot poison dart?

199
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,209
Thank you so much,
Greville. You're a good man.

200
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,511
And I know we can count
on you to be discreet.

201
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:46,285
<i>How's your day?</i>

202
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:50,322
<i>Oh, it was fine.</i>

203
00:13:52,591 --> 00:13:55,127
Mine was wonderful. Thank
you so much for asking.

204
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,463
So sorry, I've got a
head full of contracts.

205
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:02,000
Uh. You out with, uh, Tomado, weren't you?

206
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,737
Yes, we were at the club,
planning the charity dinner.

207
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:06,472
- That was amusing.
- Huh!

208
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,142
Before you ask if you have to
come, yes, you have to come.

209
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:15,380
- I've had an interesting lead.
- Really?

210
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:17,784
Might look at doing a little
bit of work in the Soviet Union.

211
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:20,986
Hmm. Do stay out of The Gulag, darling.

212
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:43,642
I wish moments like
this were not necessary.

213
00:14:44,268 --> 00:14:46,520
But it seems they are.

214
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,940
As you all know, Major Popov

215
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:52,568
was caught spying for the Americans.

216
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:55,237
We must all remember...

217
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:57,364
...the consequences of treason.

218
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,736
<i>How do you do? Greville
Wynne, pleasure.</i>

219
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:51,403
How do you do? Greville Wynne, pleasure.

220
00:16:51,904 --> 00:16:53,472
How do you do? How do you do?

221
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:55,207
And this is the head of our committee,

222
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,375
Oleg Penkovsky.

223
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,243
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

224
00:16:58,645 --> 00:16:59,712
Thank you for coming.

225
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:02,682
I'm not here to tell you

226
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:04,616
what is best for Soviet industry.

227
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:12,357
You gentlemen know that
far better than I ever will.

228
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:18,530
I'm here simply to open a door...

229
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,470
...to the top manufacturers in the West.

230
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,353
Your proposal is interesting.

231
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:45,323
- Would you like to have lunch?
- Of course...

232
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:47,526
after you.

233
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,763
<i>It is good you have dealt</i>

234
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,397
<i>with other communist governments</i>

235
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:53,666
but so far from home.

236
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:56,268
Do you not prefer to work in England?

237
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,638
I do what I can to keep things interesting.

238
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,743
But then, there's the political situation.

239
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,979
This is not good time for East and West.

240
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:09,949
Well, what I like to say is no matter what

241
00:18:09,982 --> 00:18:11,150
the politicians are doing,

242
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:16,421
factories still need machines,
machines still need parts.

243
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:19,659
I'm a businessman, so I stick to business.

244
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:27,265
Hmm!

245
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:35,007
- Do you have a family?
- I do, a boy, he's ten.

246
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:38,276
I wanted a boy very much,
then we had a girl...

247
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:39,679
now she's my world.

248
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,782
Mm. Likely not destroying
your home like our son.

249
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:52,624
Now... most important question.

250
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,527
If you want to do business in Moscow,

251
00:18:55,862 --> 00:18:56,996
I need to know...

252
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:58,865
Yes?

253
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,267
...can you hold your alcohol?

254
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:10,308
It's my one true gift.

255
00:19:22,722 --> 00:19:25,057
I want to show you another side of Russia.

256
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:26,993
- Are you free this evening?
- Certainly.

257
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,628
Where are we off to?

258
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:48,948
Do you know Cinderella?

259
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:54,419
Embarrassed to say, I've
never been to the ballet.

260
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:57,924
Then your trip is already worth it.

261
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,393
If you will, mister.

262
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:15,407
Shh!

263
00:21:21,007 --> 00:21:22,942
Your tie clip, I like it.

264
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:24,777
Where did you get it?

265
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:30,448
It was a gift from a friend.

266
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:34,519
- Is your friend American?
- Yes.

267
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:39,491
We can talk here.

268
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:41,593
It is safe.

269
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,932
I sent word to your friend, you're, um...

270
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,869
- I think the word is "amateur".
- Yes, exactly. Amateur.

271
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:56,008
I've dreamt of this moment for
a very long time. Thank you.

272
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:58,110
I wish I could tell
you how much this means.

273
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,680
I think I'd rather that you didn't tell me.

274
00:22:02,815 --> 00:22:03,950
What happens now?

275
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:06,886
I don't need to do anything, do I?

276
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,120
No, you go home.

277
00:22:08,154 --> 00:22:10,022
Then you invite me to visit London

278
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:12,792
with a trade delegation
to meet your clients.

279
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:14,794
Your government would allow you?

280
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,195
They would be thrilled.

281
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:19,198
Part of my job is to steal technology

282
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,702
from the West. Your friend is clever.

283
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,839
Well, Oleg. May I call you Oleg?

284
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:29,075
In English, my name doesn't sound good.

285
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,743
Call me Alex.

286
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:33,079
Alex.

287
00:22:39,051 --> 00:22:40,585
You're a good amateur.

288
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:00,538
Since you took me to the Bolshoi,

289
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:02,041
I suppose I should take all of you

290
00:23:02,074 --> 00:23:03,608
to the West End.

291
00:23:04,143 --> 00:23:06,078
Some of the finest theater in the world.

292
00:23:06,112 --> 00:23:07,579
That would be good.

293
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:23,528
Decadent Westerners.

294
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:25,296
This is why they are weak.

295
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:31,170
Eh, comrade Penkovsky?

296
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:38,744
And this is my wife, Sheila.

297
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:40,146
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

298
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:43,249
- <i>Nostrovia!</i>
- <i>Nostrovia!</i>

299
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:44,817
Cheers!

300
00:23:45,284 --> 00:23:46,919
Up yours, as well. That's another one.

301
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,788
- Up yours!
- Up yours!

302
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:49,855
- Up yours!
- Up yours!

303
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:31,063
- Off you go.
- Hello.

304
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,665
Hello, goodbye.

305
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,357
<i>We know you're a patriot.</i>

306
00:26:05,724 --> 00:26:08,194
We know how hard this must be for you.

307
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,431
Colonel, whatever brought you here...

308
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:17,203
it must frighten you more
than the danger of being here.

309
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:24,276
Khrushchev.

310
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:27,446
Khrushchev frightens me.

311
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:31,784
He is impulsive, chaotic,

312
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:34,420
a man like him should
have no clear command.

313
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:37,856
The West has fallen for his lie.

314
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:41,427
A lie that Soviet regime
is growing soft, it is not.

315
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:45,197
Khrushchev wants
confrontation with America.

316
00:26:45,497 --> 00:26:47,233
He's looking for one.

317
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,202
Do you have anything
you could share with us,

318
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:51,337
documents, perhaps?

319
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:54,473
Would you like to read the new edition

320
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:55,975
of <i>Military Thought?</i>

321
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,982
I need assurances from you.

322
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,519
If it becomes necessary...

323
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:10,789
I must able to defect with my family.

324
00:27:10,823 --> 00:27:12,992
Absolutely. Whenever you want.

325
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,262
I will remain in place...

326
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:19,265
and keep you updated on
the Kremlin's thinking.

327
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:21,967
But tell your government...

328
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,372
they must use my information wisely.

329
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,040
Not as a weapon...

330
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,910
but as a tool to bring peace.

331
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:52,264
Despite what Khrushchev claims,

332
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:57,870
America's nuclear arsenal is
still far superior to ours.

333
00:27:58,404 --> 00:28:01,173
We do not yet have first strike capacity.

334
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,243
You can annihilate us but
we cannot annihilate you.

335
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:07,179
But that won't worry the Politburo.

336
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:10,282
Do you think in the end
that'll keep Khrushchev

337
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:11,850
from going too far?

338
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:16,322
You have to be up in a few hours.

339
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:18,590
- I'm fine.
- No, he's right.

340
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:20,459
We can finish this up tomorrow night.

341
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:24,129
And one last thing...

342
00:28:25,431 --> 00:28:26,999
we need to talk about Greville.

343
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,102
Don't worry. You won't have
to deal with him anymore.

344
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,343
- No.
- It was Penkovsky's idea.

345
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:38,911
You're perfect, you're a civilian,

346
00:28:38,944 --> 00:28:39,813
so the KGB won't be watching you.

347
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,948
You'll be in and out of Moscow
anyway to setup contracts.

348
00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:45,117
You still won't know any specifics,

349
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,185
you'll just be a courier.

350
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:48,220
Just a courier for Russian sea...

351
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:53,359
My God, I can't believe
you're bloody serious.

352
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:55,427
We've gone over it with Penkovsky.

353
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,496
We believe the risk to you is minimal.

354
00:28:57,731 --> 00:28:59,064
And we'll pay you.

355
00:28:59,098 --> 00:29:01,266
I make my own money, thank you very much.

356
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:04,036
I have a wife and a child.

357
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,238
Either of you have a family?

358
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:08,974
Oh, no.

359
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,643
Don't suppose you could tell me about that,

360
00:29:10,677 --> 00:29:14,279
not a lot you can tell me
about, is there? Helen, James.

361
00:29:14,313 --> 00:29:16,949
I can tell you we'd both
put ourselves in harm's way

362
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:20,219
when necessary and this is
terribly necessary, Greville.

363
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:22,054
Then might I suggest you find someone

364
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,489
who's suited for it.

365
00:29:24,056 --> 00:29:26,392
Sorry. I really have
done all I can for you.

366
00:29:26,425 --> 00:29:27,493
Greville, listen.

367
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,263
The four-minute warning,
it won't do you any good.

368
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,098
- What?
- The four-minute warning

369
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,668
before a Soviet nuclear
missile hits the UK.

370
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:38,270
No, I know what that...
what are you talking about?

371
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:40,105
That... that's what
this has all been about?

372
00:29:40,139 --> 00:29:42,141
Nuclear war? Come on.

373
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,579
See, here's the problem for you.

374
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:51,450
Your house is a 12-minute
drive from your office,

375
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:53,552
ten minutes if you really push, right?

376
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:55,521
And you're usually out
on a sales call anyway,

377
00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:58,056
so you're not getting
back to Sheila in time.

378
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,125
And Andrew's school, that's nine minutes

379
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,661
from your house, 15 from your office,

380
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:03,128
and no one's getting to him either.

381
00:30:03,162 --> 00:30:05,030
He'll get herded into the school basement.

382
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,667
I looked up the building plans.

383
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,003
That's a sorry excuse
for a fallout shelter.

384
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:12,705
Same with your basement, actually.

385
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:15,240
Only the government has decent shelters.

386
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:19,646
What do you do?

387
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,548
Hmm?

388
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:24,983
You can spend those four minutes

389
00:30:25,017 --> 00:30:26,118
trying to get Sheila on the phone

390
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:27,553
but you won't be able to get through.

391
00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:32,291
Or you can think about
how you might have helped

392
00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:34,059
stop this from happening...

393
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:36,629
but you didn't.

394
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,266
And then, that's it.

395
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:46,038
How dare you.

396
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:02,187
Truly, we'll be better
off if he doesn't do it.

397
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:04,122
He'll do it.

398
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:08,260
No, I got it.

399
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:10,028
All right.

400
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,533
- Hello.
- Welcome. Do come in.

401
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:16,368
- Oh! Hello.
- Hello.

402
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,638
Oh, vodka, lovely.

403
00:31:18,972 --> 00:31:20,506
I was just saying to
Greville we didn't drink

404
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,140
nearly enough last night.

405
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:25,778
- Thank you. Uh, do come in.
- Thank you.

406
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:28,380
This is for Andrew.

407
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:31,617
Very kind, thank you.

408
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,385
This way.

409
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,803
Dad told me about Moscow.

410
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,372
What's it like in the rest of Russia?

411
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,141
It is very beautiful.

412
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:58,143
Especially where I come from.

413
00:31:58,544 --> 00:32:01,681
A lot of trees, a lot of sky.

414
00:32:02,815 --> 00:32:04,116
You feel...

415
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,120
very alone but in a good way.

416
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,822
I'd like to see that.

417
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:11,658
But then of course your government

418
00:32:11,691 --> 00:32:13,392
isn't all that keen on foreigners

419
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,227
just wandering around.

420
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,832
Do the Russians really hate us that much?

421
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:22,568
I think they'd like our children
to be a little more polite,

422
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:23,836
Andrew.

423
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:27,272
Our politicians hate your politicians.

424
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,709
And yours hate ours, do not forget that.

425
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:34,446
But the people, your father
and I, we do business.

426
00:32:34,948 --> 00:32:38,183
We spend time together, I meet his family.

427
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:41,654
Maybe we're only two people...

428
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,356
but this is how things change.

429
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:47,492
Hmm.

430
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:53,298
- What if I get caught?
- You won't.

431
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,100
You don't know that.

432
00:32:56,736 --> 00:32:58,437
They'd execute me, correct?

433
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:01,340
Not if they thought you're just
a courier that you took packages

434
00:33:01,373 --> 00:33:02,875
but didn't know what was in them.

435
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:04,677
They would hold you to
trade for one of theirs.

436
00:33:04,711 --> 00:33:06,144
For how long?

437
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,480
- A couple of years.
- Oh, just a couple of years

438
00:33:08,513 --> 00:33:10,215
rotting in some Russian Gulag.

439
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:14,286
They will not catch us.
The KGB will have no idea.

440
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:17,657
Listen, I'm better at this than they are.

441
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,759
Fine. But I'm not.

442
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:22,494
Look, your work...

443
00:33:22,962 --> 00:33:26,699
it is only deception.
Controlling your emotion.

444
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:29,836
I watched you do it in
Moscow, you did it tonight.

445
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,603
It's really not the same thing.

446
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,373
If we're caught, they
would definitely execute me.

447
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:36,241
Well, I'm very sorry
but that's your choice.

448
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,377
That is how sure I am that you can do this.

449
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:40,647
I'm betting my life on it.

450
00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:45,818
How can I explain this to Sheila?

451
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:47,386
She cannot know the truth.

452
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:49,756
For her own safety, for yours.

453
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:51,490
I can't tell her any of it?

454
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:52,524
No.

455
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,393
Well, what have you told your wife?

456
00:33:56,929 --> 00:33:59,564
Because you know what
she'd say, "Don't do it."

457
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:00,733
I'm right, aren't I?

458
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:05,170
Sheila's no fool. And in the past, I've...

459
00:34:05,738 --> 00:34:08,540
given her reason not to trust me dully.

460
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:12,611
Then you have to lie better.

461
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:15,547
There are good lies.

462
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:18,583
Sometimes a lie is gift...

463
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:20,853
an act of love.

464
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,823
I'm sorry it has to be you.

465
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,694
But, Greville...

466
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,395
it has to be you.

467
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:38,270
<i>In Moscow, you must at all times</i>

468
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,906
<i>follow the rules of the art.</i>

469
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,606
In English, there's a word.

470
00:34:41,974 --> 00:34:43,710
- Tradecraft.
- Yes.

471
00:34:43,976 --> 00:34:45,845
You must follow tradecraft.

472
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:48,547
<i>Everyone you meet,
assume they are KGB,</i>

473
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:51,651
<i>waiters, hotel staff,
my driver, everyone.</i>

474
00:34:52,284 --> 00:34:54,586
<i>Even if they are not
actual KGB officers,</i>

475
00:34:54,987 --> 00:34:56,856
<i>they still make reports to KGB.</i>

476
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:57,622
Ooh!

477
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:00,860
<i>Every Russian is an
eye of the state.</i>

478
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:04,296
<i>Every room you're in,
assume it is bugged.</i>

479
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,698
<i>Even inside our embassy.</i>

480
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:07,734
<i>Especially inside your embassy.</i>

481
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,970
Still, our embassy
will be a good fail-safe

482
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,270
in the event of any...

483
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:13,840
complication.

484
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,609
<i>The KGB also uses lip readers.</i>

485
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:19,578
<i>You won't be able to
tell who they are.</i>

486
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:20,747
<i>So never discuss...</i>

487
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,281

How's your family?

489
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:27,619
Very well, thank you. How's yours?

490
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:30,890
<i>We will be seeing each other often.</i>

491

<i>To throw off suspicion,</i>

492
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:36,261
<i>I will tell my colleagues I
recruited you as a source.</i>

493

<i>You'll keep Colonel
Penkovsky supplied</i>

<i>with material on
steel manufacturing,</i>

<i>They'll believe I would do that?</i>

498
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:51,677
<i>Of course.</i>

499
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:54,379
<i>You are a greedy capitalist.</i>

500
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:56,783
<i>You want to keep the
contracts coming.</i>

501
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:00,887
<i>And from now on, every
moment you're in Moscow,</i>

502
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,955
<i>you will be selling one thing.</i>

503
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,425
<i>The idea that you are
an ordinary businessman</i>

504
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,896
<i>and nothing more than
an ordinary businessman.</i>

505
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:10,863
Well, gentlemen, I hope

506
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:14,599
this is the first of many.
Thank you all very, very much.

507
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:17,069
For good health and for business.

508
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:19,839
I should get you to the airport.

509
00:36:19,872 --> 00:36:21,040
Yes, yes, please.

510

<i>Do you have any questions?</i>

511
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,043
Gentlemen, 'till next time. Thank you.

512
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,913
<i>I want to be certain of one thing.</i>

513
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,050

anything happens to me,</i>

514

<i>You have my word...</i>

516
00:36:37,422 --> 00:36:38,958
<i>and I speak for the crown.</i>

517

Mr. Wynne is a guest of my committee.

518
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,185
Let him through.

519
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:07,452
Thank you, Alex. Bye.

520
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,360
Thank you.

521
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:17,422
- My, where did that come from?
- I missed you.

522
00:38:17,957 --> 00:38:21,459
- Well, just this one time.
- Oh, every time, darling.

523
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:36,208
They're really gearing up for war.

524
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:39,912
This is phenomenal.
Ironbark's the real thing.

525
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:43,182
Well, this just became the biggest thing

526
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:45,017
going in the whole Soviet Section.

527
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:48,486
Now, if I keep you on this...

528
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:51,090
am I gonna regret it?

529
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:52,892
No, sir.

530
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:57,897
Hell!

531
00:38:58,164 --> 00:38:59,999
This is almost worth all the bullshit

532
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:03,769
of dealing with the Brits.
How is it with those assholes?

533
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,871
They're good guys. I just
have to make them think

534
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:06,706
they're in charge.

535
00:39:07,106 --> 00:39:11,143

Grev, would you think it's
safe to keep going to Moscow?

547
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:51,516
Yes, certainly. It's fine.

548

Even with all this?

549
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:56,989
That's in Berlin, darling.
Nowhere near Moscow.

550
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,657
Yes, I know where Berlin is

551
00:39:58,691 --> 00:39:59,792

and the Americans...

Oh, right.

577
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,911
Sorry.

578
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:34,280
It's fine. The forecast is a sun.

579
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:36,482
No, it's not fine. What
if the forecast is wrong?

580
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:37,449
What if it rains?

581
00:42:37,483 --> 00:42:39,885
Well, we'll want to
stay in the tent anyway.

582
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,287
We can read books. It'll be lovely.

583
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,421
It's not the point. The point is,

584
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,489
I told you to pack the raincoats,

585
00:42:43,789 --> 00:42:46,825
I made myself perfectly
clear. So why didn't you do it?

586
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,160
Greville, are you certain
this is how you want

587
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:49,228
- to start our holiday?
- Answer me!

588
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:50,196
I...

589
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:52,932
I...

590
00:42:53,933 --> 00:42:54,600
forgot.

591
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,403
You forgot? You know, that's fantastic.

592
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:59,305
I've got a son who's too
dumb to remember something...

593
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:01,373
- Greville, Greville! Greville!
- ...as simple as packing the...

594
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:07,346
Your father didn't mean that.

595

Shall we start again, hmm?

596
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:29,501
Is he all right?

597
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:33,272
He's asleep. It's a good sign.

598
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:36,275
Here.

599
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:43,382
- Will you be all right?
- Oh, fine.

600
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:49,855
I really needed this
holiday and it's a good idea.

601
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:50,990
Glad we came here.

602
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:55,127
It's not just tonight.

603
00:43:56,528 --> 00:43:58,264
You've been so different lately.

604
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,968
Greville, what's going on?

605
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:10,776
Look, I didn't want to
tell you before because I...

606
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,346
I didn't want you to be involved.

607
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,555
It's the business. Yeah, we've...

608
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,392
hit a bit of a rough patch.

609
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:31,430
<i>That makes sense, doesn't it?</i>

610
00:44:32,097 --> 00:44:33,232
<i>Men and money?</i>

611
00:44:33,265 --> 00:44:35,200
My God, Colin went almost mad last year

612
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:37,069
when his job looked the tiniest bit shaky.

613
00:44:38,103 --> 00:44:40,339
I wish it made sense
but it's not just that.

614
00:44:40,372 --> 00:44:41,173
It's everything.

615
00:44:41,507 --> 00:44:44,209
He's exercising all the
time and he's become so...

616
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:48,847
- energetic in bed.
- That all sounds so awful.

617
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:51,483
Poor you.

618
00:44:52,384 --> 00:44:55,220
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't joke.

619
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:59,391
I know Greville had an
indiscretion once before but

620
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:00,893
it doesn't mean he's having an affair now.

621
00:45:00,926 --> 00:45:02,594
Then why is he so secretive with me?

622
00:45:03,495 --> 00:45:04,596
And defensive?

623
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:07,433
And it's always worse
whenever he comes home

624
00:45:07,466 --> 00:45:08,434
from Moscow.

625
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,970
That's when it all started. Moscow.

626
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:14,206
Oh.

627
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,644
<i>Might be better if you
didn't have to travel</i>

628
00:45:17,677 --> 00:45:19,211
<i>so much...</i>

629
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,246
better for our family.

630
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,115
Darling, I told you, it's very important.

631
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:24,249
- We need the money.
- The money?

632
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:26,418
- Money, yes.
- I thought you needed the club?

633
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:27,886
And you haven't caught any expenses

634
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,455
and now we're going to a smart restaurant.

635
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:32,157
Really, not quite certain, how I'm supposed

636
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:32,958
to respond to that.

637
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:35,894
I mean, why can't we live the
good life? It's why I work.

638
00:45:35,928 --> 00:45:38,063
Greville, I'm asking you
to stop going to Moscow.

639
00:45:38,097 --> 00:45:39,398
I'm asking you as your wife.

640
00:45:39,431 --> 00:45:40,232
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

641
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:43,335
- There is no one else, I swear.
- I forgave you once,

642
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:45,070
I never said I would again.

643
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:47,873
Hello, Nina.

644
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:50,309
Very nice to meet you.

645
00:45:50,744 --> 00:45:52,679
She's never seen a foreigner before.

646
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,531
My wife apologizes.

647
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:14,667
We cannot invite you for dinner.

648
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:18,070
To bring a foreigner into
one's home, it is not done.

649
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:21,273
It's all right. I'd understand.

650
00:46:30,683 --> 00:46:32,117
You have a lovely family.

651
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:33,585
Thank you.

652
00:46:38,123 --> 00:46:39,124
Alex...

653
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:41,293
when do you think you'll
be ready to defect?

654
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,129
It is best if we do not talk about that.

655
00:46:44,363 --> 00:46:45,497
Is something the matter?

656
00:46:47,433 --> 00:46:48,967
Just a bit of trouble at home.

657
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,604
One day, you will be able to tell Sheila

658
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:55,007
what you have done and
she'll be very proud of you.

659
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,442
That might be a bit too late.

660
00:46:56,942 --> 00:47:00,412
Sometimes Vera, she also
struggles with my work.

661
00:47:00,446 --> 00:47:01,748
Yes, but your wife married a soldier,

662
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:03,182
mine married a salesman.

663
00:47:05,384 --> 00:47:07,352
You know why my government will not let you

664
00:47:07,386 --> 00:47:10,657
travel outside Moscow? They
want to hide the suffering.

665
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:16,528
In the city life is all right,

666
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:18,330
but in the country where I'm from...

667
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,166
I do not want this life for Nina.

668
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,535
I want her to be free from the State.

669
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:28,741
Someday, if our work succeeds,
when I feel the danger is over,

670
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:30,576
then I will defect.

671
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:33,345
I will bring my family to Montana.

672
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:36,381
- Montana?
- Yeah. I've seen some pictures,

673
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,751
it is beautiful like where I grew up.

674
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,387
Perhaps, I will become a cowboy.

675
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:45,090
You a cowboy?

676
00:47:45,624 --> 00:47:48,427
- Oh, that I would like to see.
- Yes.

677
00:47:48,928 --> 00:47:52,030
You must come and visit,
with your family, please.

678
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:53,766
I would like that very much.

679
00:47:54,634 --> 00:47:56,168
I would like that too.

680
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,006
All right. I will.

681
00:48:04,844 --> 00:48:06,612
Sir?

682
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:07,780
Thank you so much.

683
00:48:27,332 --> 00:48:28,433
<i>What do you have?</i>

684
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:31,370
I'm seeing references to a lot of new intel

685
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:33,205
coming from the Soviet Section.

686
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:35,107
Can you access any of it?

687
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:37,175
No. It's all way above my clearance.

688
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:39,444
But I don't think it's
coming from intercepts.

689
00:48:39,812 --> 00:48:41,480
It feels like they might have a source.

690
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:48,103
Chairman Khruschev, so far

691
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:50,230
Cuba has been more trouble than it's worth.

692
00:48:50,439 --> 00:48:52,399
It's our one foothold in Latin America.

693
00:48:52,483 --> 00:48:56,028
But it's too isolated. We
can't expand from there.

694
00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:57,529
It's a weak spot for us.

695
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,908
I agree.

696
00:49:00,991 --> 00:49:02,284
It is now.

697
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:10,876
But we can turn it into a
weak spot for the Americans.

698
00:49:17,149 --> 00:49:19,852
<i>I... I just don't see it
for them to actually do that</i>

699
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,788
<i>to try and sneak nukes
into our backyard,</i>

700
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:24,389
- I mean, it would be...
- It'll be like an act of war.

701
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,592
Even Khrushchev isn't that crazy.

702
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,394
All I can tell you is that Ironbark

703
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,163
wouldn't be in the job he or she is in

704
00:49:31,196 --> 00:49:32,832
if he or she were an idiot.

705
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,468
I hope we take this seriously.

706
00:49:40,873 --> 00:49:42,608
Stay on this, guys.

707
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:46,478
Work every Cuba source we got.

708
00:51:12,431 --> 00:51:14,366
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you, Alex.

709
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:19,598
Colonel?

710
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,318
Sorry, your secretary is away.

711
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,570
Oleg Gribanov, KGB. Do
you have a few minutes?

712
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,530
Of course, come in.

713
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:31,327
It's an honour to finally meet you.

714
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:37,041
I know men who served under you in Kiev.

715
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:39,835
They say they owe you their lives.

716
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:42,046
I thought...

717
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,549
...you might remember these from Ankara.

718
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:48,927
Contraband, I know, but...

719
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,669
We're curious about...

720
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:24,129
Greville Wynne.

721
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:27,633
Have you noticed anything
unorthodox about him?

722
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:30,302
Behaviour? Interactions?

723
00:53:31,971 --> 00:53:34,223
Nothing of concern.

724
00:53:34,974 --> 00:53:37,434
Or I would have noted
it in my contact reports.

725
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:40,354
Yes, I read those, very thoroughly.

726
00:53:40,896 --> 00:53:42,690
But now that I tell you
we're looking into him...

727
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,819
...does anything come to mind?

728
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:50,155
He's been coming to Moscow for awhile.

729
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:53,200
Why the concern now?

730
00:53:53,575 --> 00:53:56,161
Because he's been coming
to Moscow for awhile.

731
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:02,710
Meets with many officials,
he goes many places.

732
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:05,754
Over time, this creates questions.

733
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:11,051
From what I've seen,

734
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:13,512
Wynne is interested in making
money and not much else.

735
00:54:13,595 --> 00:54:15,806
But I will be sure...

736
00:54:16,557 --> 00:54:19,393
...to observe him even more closely.

737
00:54:22,813 --> 00:54:24,356
Thank you, Colonel.

738
00:54:24,857 --> 00:54:26,942
I won't take any more of your time.

739
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:28,861
Thank you for warning me.

740
00:54:30,362 --> 00:54:31,822
I'll leave you the cigarettes...

741
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:38,689
...and send you a whole carton.

742
00:54:53,185 --> 00:54:55,855
<i>Ironbark gave us camouflage profiles</i>

743
00:54:55,888 --> 00:54:57,757
for different kinds of
missile installations

744
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:58,958
so we could tell 'em apart.

745
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:02,028
As soon as we get some U-2 photos

746
00:55:02,061 --> 00:55:03,963
<i>we'll know if Cuba's
got nukes or not.</i>

747
00:55:04,163 --> 00:55:06,999
<i>And whether Russian missiles
can reach mainland US</i>

748
00:55:07,033 --> 00:55:08,067
<i>for the first time.</i>

749
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,736
Can they get a U-2 in the air?

750
00:55:10,937 --> 00:55:14,006
This time of year there's
just too much cloud cover.

751
00:55:15,141 --> 00:55:17,910
'Til October you're all I got.

752
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,479
Mm-hmm.

753
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:24,116
When I went back to my
hotel they searched my room.

754
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:25,685
But they didn't find anything?

755
00:55:26,085 --> 00:55:27,920
Obviously he wouldn't be here if they had.

756
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:29,689
I'm saying he's still in the clear.

757
00:55:29,922 --> 00:55:32,825
It could just have been a
routine check which he passed.

758
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:35,828
That's it Greville, we're pulling you out.

759
00:55:36,362 --> 00:55:38,064
But what about Penkovsky?

760
00:55:38,097 --> 00:55:39,932
I didn't have a chance to warn him.

761
00:55:39,966 --> 00:55:41,634
We'll have to find another
way to communicate with him,

762
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:42,868
but you don't need to worry about that.

763
00:55:42,902 --> 00:55:44,236
No. You don't understand.

764
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:47,572
That's why he's in danger as well.

765
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:49,507
If the KGB have been looking at me,

766
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:50,376
they'll be looking at him too.

767
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:53,012
He's still set to come here
for the trade fair next month,

768
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:53,779
- doesn't he?
- Yes.

769
00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:56,048
Then he's all right. If
he was under suspicion

770
00:55:56,082 --> 00:55:57,883
they'd never let him leave the country.

771
00:56:00,386 --> 00:56:03,555
But you will still help
him to defect, won't you?

772
00:56:03,756 --> 00:56:06,624
Whatever he likes, he's more
than earned his retirement

773
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:10,062
and Greville so have you. Outstanding work.

774
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:12,865
Oh, my God.

775
00:56:16,135 --> 00:56:17,737
So... so, that's it.

776
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,709
Cuba. What about Cuba?

777
00:56:23,743 --> 00:56:25,678
Do try not to worry
about any of this anymore.

778
00:56:25,711 --> 00:56:27,847
Put it all out of your head, best you can.

779
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:32,018
Understood.

780
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:40,059
Well, thank you.

781
00:56:44,897 --> 00:56:49,035
What the hell are you doing?
We're shutting down Wynne, now?

782
00:56:49,068 --> 00:56:51,771
Please recall, Wynne is a British national.

783
00:56:52,038 --> 00:56:53,339
Any fallout from his capture

784
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:55,041
would cause a major embarrassment

785
00:56:55,074 --> 00:56:55,775
for the government.

786
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:58,711
We have to know what
Penkovsky knows about Cuba.

787
00:56:58,744 --> 00:56:59,912
Which at the moment is nothing.

788
00:57:00,112 --> 00:57:02,848
He'll be here next month,
we'll debrief him them.

789
00:57:02,882 --> 00:57:03,949
That's all.

790
00:57:40,953 --> 00:57:42,021
I'm, uh...

791
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:45,157
I'm closing all the accounts in Moscow.

792
00:57:45,825 --> 00:57:47,259
So I won't be going anymore.

793
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:49,128
All right.

794
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:55,034
- Sure you don't want me to help?
- I'm fine. Thank you.

795
00:58:30,002 --> 00:58:31,036
Papa!

796
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:33,272
Nina.

797
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:45,951
How are you feeling?

798
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:48,287
Much better.

799
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,582
She says I've been working too hard.

800
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:54,001
My body decided to give
itself a little vacation.

801
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,046
I want to keep him here a few days

802
00:58:57,129 --> 00:58:58,881
to rest.

803
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,883
Then he should be back to normal.

804
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,343
Thank you.

805
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,973
Nina...

806
00:59:09,058 --> 00:59:11,727
...can I talk with your father alone?

807
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:22,905
Really, I feel fine.

808
00:59:24,073 --> 00:59:26,825
I couldn't wait to tell you...

809
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,036
What?

810
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:33,332
I'm pregnant.

811
00:59:44,343 --> 00:59:46,595
This one feels like a boy.

812
00:59:55,354 --> 00:59:59,191
<i>This government, as
promised, has maintained...</i>

813
00:59:59,225 --> 01:00:03,295
<i>the closest surveillance of
the Soviet military build-up</i>

814
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,364
<i>on the island of Cuba.</i>

815
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:07,366
<i>Within the past week</i>

816
01:00:07,866 --> 01:00:10,970
<i>unmistakable evidence
has established the fact</i>

817
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,473
<i>that a series of
offensive missiles sites</i>

818
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:18,510
<i>is now in preparation on
that imprisoned island.</i>

819
01:00:19,144 --> 01:00:22,514
<i>The purpose of these
bases can be none other</i>

820
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:25,985
<i>than to provide a
nuclear strike capability</i>

821
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,987
<i>against the Western Hemisphere.</i>

822
01:00:29,188 --> 01:00:31,190
<i>It shall be the
policy of this nation</i>

823
01:00:31,523 --> 01:00:33,492
<i>to regard any nuclear missile</i>

824
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:36,161
<i>launched from Cuba
against any nation</i>

825
01:00:36,195 --> 01:00:37,463
<i>in the Western Hemisphere</i>

826
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:39,198
<i>as an attack</i>

827
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:41,533
<i>by the Soviet Union
on the United States.</i>

828
01:00:42,034 --> 01:00:45,170
<i>Requiring a full
retaliatory response</i>

829
01:00:45,204 --> 01:00:46,839
<i>upon the Soviet Union.</i>

830
01:00:47,273 --> 01:00:49,208
<i>I call upon Chairman Khrushchev</i>

831
01:00:49,541 --> 01:00:52,311
<i>to halt and eliminate
this clandestine...</i>

832
01:00:52,953 --> 01:00:54,496
Excuse me, Colonel?

833
01:00:54,747 --> 01:00:57,666
I'm Irina from the Trade Ministry.

834
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,421
I wanted to speak to you
about the London trade fair.

835
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:05,591
Yes, our preparations are going very well.

836
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,595
The minister has decided
you do not need to attend.

837
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,682
Oh. Are we not sending a delegation?

838
01:01:14,892 --> 01:01:16,101
We are...

839
01:01:16,185 --> 01:01:18,228
but the Minister feels
your other work is too

840
01:01:18,312 --> 01:01:19,730
...valuable to neglect right now.

841
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:21,690
He would like you to remain in Moscow.

842
01:01:21,857 --> 01:01:23,275
Of course.

843
01:01:23,859 --> 01:01:26,278
Please tell the Minister
I won't let him down.

844
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:14,159
The Soviets are standing firm,

845
01:02:14,193 --> 01:02:16,428
but JFK is refusing to back down.

846
01:02:16,962 --> 01:02:18,897
<i>It's out of our hands now.</i>

847
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:21,533
<i>Anything could happen.</i>

848
01:02:24,103 --> 01:02:25,537
- Telegram.
- Thank you.

849
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,188
It's time. It's got to be.

850
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:45,090
- Time for what?
- Time to get him out.

851
01:02:45,124 --> 01:02:46,492
Greville, we can't get him out.

852
01:02:46,693 --> 01:02:47,893
Of course you can.

853
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:52,498
Well then, what did you mean when you said

854
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:54,199
you were gonna help him to defect?

855
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,502
Family holiday to East Germany,

856
01:02:56,535 --> 01:02:57,469
crossover in Berlin,

857
01:02:57,503 --> 01:02:59,505
to try and smuggle them
right out of Moscow,

858
01:02:59,538 --> 01:03:01,273
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- But you're MI6

859
01:03:01,306 --> 01:03:02,007
and CIA.

860
01:03:02,274 --> 01:03:03,375
I can't get anywhere near Penkovsky now,

861
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:06,646
so there's no way to coordinate
with him or plan it out.

862
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:08,981
We'd have to kidnap him and
his family off the street.

863
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:10,249
It'd be a disaster.

864
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:13,585
And if they won't let
them leave, then what?

865
01:03:15,521 --> 01:03:17,456
It was my idea to bring you into all this.

866
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:19,525
I never should have done
that to you. I'm sorry.

867
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:25,431
Well then, that's it?

868
01:03:29,301 --> 01:03:31,336
We're just going to abandon
him and let the KGB murder him

869
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:32,504
whenever they get round to it?

870
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:34,339
This is a hard truth.

871
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:37,009
But if things were the other way around,

872
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,578
- Penkovsky would abandon you.
- No. No, he would not.

873
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:41,313
He's a professional. We use people.

874
01:03:41,346 --> 01:03:43,348
He would do just what I'm doing now.

875
01:03:43,582 --> 01:03:45,617
Move on. Go home.

876
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:48,954
Go home to your family.

877
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:58,297
You're wrong.

878
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:00,700
What?

879
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,739
You're the experts on spying
and tradecraft and all of that,

880
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:09,475
but not Penkovsky. You've
met him once, I know him.

881
01:04:10,142 --> 01:04:12,611
He would never leave me to die.

882
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:13,847
And I'm not leaving him.

883
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,881
I'm afraid it's not your decision.

884
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,183
You said the problem was,
there's no way to coordinate

885
01:04:18,217 --> 01:04:20,085
to let Penkovsky know about the escape plan

886
01:04:20,118 --> 01:04:21,453
but there is a way.

887
01:04:22,254 --> 01:04:23,255
Me.

888
01:04:24,223 --> 01:04:25,357
I can tell him...

889
01:04:26,659 --> 01:04:28,227
if I go back to Moscow.

890
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:30,395
- You would do that?
- Yes.

891
01:04:30,429 --> 01:04:31,163
No, he wouldn't.

892
01:04:31,396 --> 01:04:33,198
Because he hasn't entirely lost his mind.

893
01:04:33,232 --> 01:04:34,533
James, be a bloody professional.

894
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:36,435
I'm volunteering to
bring back the best source

895
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:38,170
of Soviet intelligence you got at a time

896
01:04:38,203 --> 01:04:41,039
where Russia and America are
on the brink of nuclear war.

897
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:44,677
You talk about using people,
for God's sake use me.

898
01:04:49,749 --> 01:04:51,651
If you go back to Moscow, I'll go with you.

899
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:54,586
At no risk to herself. She'll
have diplomatic immunity.

900
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,588
- She thinks you're a fool.
- I will do everything

901
01:04:56,622 --> 01:04:58,390
in my power to get both of you

902
01:04:58,423 --> 01:04:59,826
- out of there.
- But I am telling you,

903
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:01,360
don't do it.

904
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,180
Oh, I didn't know you were...

905
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:35,294
I have just one last account
to close, then I'm finished.

906
01:05:36,361 --> 01:05:37,362
Truly.

907
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,164
Of course. Yes.

908
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:42,100
And where are you staying tonight?

909
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:47,306
A hotel I think would be best.

910
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:15,768
- Alex.
- Hello.

911
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,490
Hi. I'm Karen Tucker.
I'm the new press attache.

912
01:07:17,596 --> 01:07:20,833
Our assets will take a boat
from Finland to Sosnovy Bor.

913
01:07:21,034 --> 01:07:22,669
Port security there is light.

914
01:07:22,902 --> 01:07:25,672
They'll pick the Penkovskys
up, ferry them back across.

915
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:27,907
I need you to take the
van and divert the KGB

916
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,541
when we leave the embassy, okay?

917
01:07:30,308 --> 01:07:31,878
If we can just get the Penkovskys

918
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:33,545
out of Moscow clean,

919
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,348
- we should be all right.
- Yup. Okay.

920
01:07:37,784 --> 01:07:39,251
You're going to do fine.

921
01:07:39,284 --> 01:07:40,720
<i>Permanent representatives</i>

<i>all concerned should

<i>and bring with it the risk of war.</i>

931

<i>Now, we will explain what to do</i>

932

<i>if a warning sounds

933
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:15,353
<i>You must immediately take cover.</i>

<i>Send your children

01:08:27,265 --> 01:08:29,401
<i>placed and is placing medium</i>

938

<i>Yes or no?</i>

01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:42,547

<i>Which you can all

<i>in the area of San Cristobal.</i>

<i>And that is only one example.</i>

950
01:12:02,014 --> 01:12:03,548
Bravo.

951
01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:07,086
Bravo.

952
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:08,888
Bravo.

953
01:12:11,523 --> 01:12:12,959
Bravo.

954
01:12:23,435 --> 01:12:25,562
I have a light day.

955
01:12:25,646 --> 01:12:27,147
I'll come home after lunch.

956
01:12:27,273 --> 01:12:29,108
- Hmm!
- Mm-hmm.

957
01:12:30,442 --> 01:12:31,777
We...

958
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:33,988
...can do something
fun, would you like that?

959
01:12:35,155 --> 01:12:36,240
Yes, Daddy.

960
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:39,034
And you could wear that red dress for me?

961
01:12:47,193 --> 01:12:48,861
<i>Kennedy has sent the offer.</i>

962

<i>If the Soviets take out their nukes,</i>

963
01:12:52,064 --> 01:12:54,200
<i>JFK will declare publicly</i>

964
01:12:54,532 --> 01:12:58,204
- <i>that the US will stand down.</i>
- Think they'll go for that?

965
01:12:58,738 --> 01:13:00,206
I really don't know.

966
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:23,561
Good luck.

967
01:13:45,785 --> 01:13:46,952
Can I take you to the airport?

968
01:13:47,153 --> 01:13:49,755
Oh, that would be perfect, thank you.

969
01:15:32,358 --> 01:15:33,893
Excuse me, what did they say?

970
01:15:35,761 --> 01:15:38,931
They say, "We're sorry for the delay."

971
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:40,366
Thank you.

972
01:15:47,773 --> 01:15:48,741
Vera!

973
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:54,688
We need to leave.

974
01:16:11,121 --> 01:16:13,040
I have diplomatic status.

975
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:23,050
Have a seat, Colonel.

976
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:36,689
Oleg, what's happening?

977
01:16:38,065 --> 01:16:39,233
Tell her.

978
01:16:39,316 --> 01:16:41,151
She didn't know anything, you can see that.

979
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:43,070
Tell your family why we're here.

980
01:16:51,203 --> 01:16:52,246
I am...

981
01:16:52,329 --> 01:16:53,664
I am a traitor.

982
01:16:54,206 --> 01:16:55,958
I betrayed the revolution.

983
01:17:02,297 --> 01:17:03,882
I'm so sorry.

984
01:17:09,388 --> 01:17:10,889
I believed in you for so long.

985
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,434
I defended you around the Kremlin.

986
01:17:14,184 --> 01:17:15,561
And now this.

987
01:17:16,562 --> 01:17:17,646
How long have you known?

988
01:17:18,147 --> 01:17:19,898
Not until I had you poisoned.

989
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:23,110
While you were in hospital,

990
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:25,529
we did a search and
found your hiding place.

991
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:27,990
Installed surveillance.

992
01:17:28,615 --> 01:17:30,492
We saw your plans last night,

993
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:34,079
and came in this morning for a closer look.

994
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:37,166
And now the game is over.

995
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:40,669
I swear my family did not know.

996
01:17:41,003 --> 01:17:43,130
We will discuss your family later.

997
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:46,050
It's time to go.

998
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:48,554
Mr. Wynne...

999
01:18:51,857 --> 01:18:54,526
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1000
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:58,130
He said, come with us, Mr. Wynne.

1001
01:18:58,163 --> 01:18:59,565
Why, what's going on? I don't understand.

1002
01:18:59,598 --> 01:19:02,234
Mr. Wynne, please.

1003
01:19:29,194 --> 01:19:32,030
<i>The Union of Soviet
Socialist Republic,</i>

1004
01:19:32,398 --> 01:19:35,067
<i>has declared you persona non grata.</i>

1005
01:19:35,434 --> 01:19:37,637
<i>You are hereby ordered
to leave the country</i>

1006
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:39,338
<i>within 24 hours.</i>

1007
01:20:34,059 --> 01:20:35,194
Strip!

1008
01:20:36,228 --> 01:20:38,030
Strip!

1009
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:52,504
One, two, three.

1010
01:22:01,146 --> 01:22:02,147
Thank you.

1011
01:22:15,193 --> 01:22:16,361
You were right.

1012
01:22:19,431 --> 01:22:20,532
You were right, too.

1013
01:22:28,307 --> 01:22:29,308
We had to try.

1014
01:22:43,856 --> 01:22:46,726
Mrs. Wynne, I'm James Dobie
with the Board of Trade,

1015
01:22:46,759 --> 01:22:49,261
- may we come in?
- Yes, please.

1016
01:22:58,905 --> 01:23:00,907
- Oh, my God.
- It's absurd, of course.

1017
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,275
The Foreign Office is hard
at work sorting this out.

1018
01:23:03,308 --> 01:23:06,478
- But it's a delicate situation.
- Why?

1019
01:23:06,511 --> 01:23:09,849
Oleg Penkovsky has been arrested
as well, which is quite serious.

1020
01:23:10,683 --> 01:23:12,451
The Russians are claiming
Greville was caught up

1021
01:23:12,484 --> 01:23:13,552
in some sort of...

1022
01:23:14,754 --> 01:23:16,154
well, espionage.

1023
01:23:17,657 --> 01:23:19,458
The Foreign Office will be in touch soon.

1024
01:23:19,491 --> 01:23:21,193
And while this is all being resolved,

1025
01:23:21,226 --> 01:23:23,362
The Crown will provide
for you and your son.

1026
01:23:23,395 --> 01:23:25,865
- It's true, isn't it?
- What's true?

1027
01:23:25,898 --> 01:23:28,333
Greville was working with
Penkovsky like they say?

1028
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:29,102
No, no. Of course not.

1029
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:30,435
Can I call Greville,
I need to speak to him.

1030
01:23:30,469 --> 01:23:32,639
- I don't think that's...
- No, I have to... I have to...

1031
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:34,473
I have to tell him that I'm sorry.

1032
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:37,744
I thought he was...

1033
01:23:39,211 --> 01:23:41,313
My God, I've been so stupid.

1034
01:23:41,648 --> 01:23:43,415
- Mommy?
- Andrew, go to your room.

1035
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:45,617
- Who are...
- Andrew, go to your room!

1036
01:23:45,652 --> 01:23:46,686
I'm a friend of your father's.

1037
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,621
He told me you have quite
the trophy collection.

1038
01:23:49,656 --> 01:23:50,923
Could you show me?

1039
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:55,260
Andrew please, it's all right.

1040
01:24:03,803 --> 01:24:05,404
Don't tell me it's not true.

1041
01:24:06,571 --> 01:24:07,940
I know my husband.

1042
01:24:09,508 --> 01:24:10,777
I know he's been acting.

1043
01:24:12,912 --> 01:24:14,546
Don't tell me it's not true.

1044
01:24:18,017 --> 01:24:19,952
There are things I can't say to you.

1045
01:24:31,998 --> 01:24:37,235
I can tell you that your husband
is an incredibly brave man.

1046
01:24:38,603 --> 01:24:40,640
And he needs you now.

1047
01:24:41,674 --> 01:24:43,710
He needs your help, Mrs. Wynne.

1048
01:24:44,509 --> 01:24:48,580
You see, once the Russians
realize Greville is innocent,

1049
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:51,450
your government will be
able to get him home safe.

1050
01:24:52,051 --> 01:24:53,251
In time.

1051
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,856
But if the Russians do decide...

1052
01:24:57,456 --> 01:25:00,760
that Greville actually
is some kind of spy...

1053
01:25:03,863 --> 01:25:04,997
I'm so sorry.

1054
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,969
So when you talk to anybody...

1055
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,305
that means your family...

1056
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,009
your friends, Andrew, and
especially the press...

1057
01:25:19,746 --> 01:25:21,346
you have to tell them that none of this

1058
01:25:21,379 --> 01:25:22,682
could possibly be true.

1059
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:25,283
And you have to be very convincing.

1060
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:30,355
Can you do that?

1061
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:37,496
Can you do that for Greville?

1062
01:25:44,603 --> 01:25:47,907
I can't imagine what Penkovsky
could've confessed to.

1063
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:59,384
I... I'm sorry, I don't know what this is.

1064
01:26:00,418 --> 01:26:01,687
We know everything,

1065
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:05,357
we know that Penkovsky gave you
packages to take to the West.

1066
01:26:05,624 --> 01:26:08,493
- Well, yes, a few times.
- Then you admit it.

1067
01:26:09,929 --> 01:26:13,598
Admit what? I didn't know that
I was doing anything wrong?

1068
01:26:13,633 --> 01:26:15,668
You think stealing Soviet intelligence

1069
01:26:15,701 --> 01:26:16,401
wasn't wrong?

1070
01:26:16,936 --> 01:26:19,906
If that is what was
happening, I didn't know it.

1071
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,909
I never asked him what was in the packages,

1072
01:26:22,942 --> 01:26:24,376
I didn't think it was my business.

1073
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:26,411
Who did you give these packages to?

1074
01:26:26,444 --> 01:26:27,780
Well, I dropped them off

1075
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:29,649
in various addresses around London,

1076
01:26:29,682 --> 01:26:31,583
I never thought anything of it.

1077
01:26:34,687 --> 01:26:35,822
Mr. Wynne...

1078
01:26:36,856 --> 01:26:40,592
you were asking me to believe
that you are very, very stupid.

1079
01:26:40,893 --> 01:26:43,395
Oh, well, yes.

1080
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:47,432
I suppose in your world I am,
but, look, I'm just a salesman.

1081
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:52,805
I want my clients to like
me, so if that meant doing...

1082
01:26:53,371 --> 01:26:55,675
a favor for Penkovsky every now and then,

1083
01:26:55,708 --> 01:26:57,977
I really didn't see the harm.

1084
01:29:04,203 --> 01:29:05,204
Hi.

1085
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,009
Ah! That is so sweet of you.

1086
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:12,510
Oh, but I wish I could
invite you in, I'm just...

1087
01:29:12,878 --> 01:29:13,779
I'm in the middle of 20 things.

1088
01:29:14,046 --> 01:29:17,783
Oh, no, no. That's fine. I'm
so glad to see you're well.

1089
01:29:17,817 --> 01:29:19,885
It's been ages, we've all been worried.

1090
01:29:19,919 --> 01:29:21,821
Yes, well, do say hello for me.

1091
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:25,191
Of course. I saw that ridiculous
piece in the <i>Mail.</i>

1092
01:29:25,391 --> 01:29:26,759
It's so absurd.

1093
01:29:27,793 --> 01:29:30,628
You don't think there could
be any truth to it, do you?

1094
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:32,530
What they're saying about Greville?

1095
01:29:32,564 --> 01:29:34,000
Don't be ridiculous.

1096
01:29:34,467 --> 01:29:36,702
How could Greville ever spy on Soviets,

1097
01:29:36,736 --> 01:29:38,536
he couldn't even hide his affair for me.

1098
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:40,039
- Right.
- Thank you again for dropping by

1099
01:29:40,072 --> 01:29:41,807
- and this was so sweet of you.
- Oh.

1100
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:42,942
We should have tea.

1101
01:29:42,975 --> 01:29:44,576
- I'll be in touch. Thank you.
- Yes!

1102
01:29:44,609 --> 01:29:48,014
Oh, all right. Bye.

1103
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:11,804
For years the Americans
have had the nuclear missiles

1104
01:30:11,837 --> 01:30:13,205
in Turkey...

1105
01:30:14,106 --> 01:30:17,009
aimed right at us.

1106
01:30:19,011 --> 01:30:23,049
Oh, but how dare we put missiles in Cuba...

1107
01:30:24,616 --> 01:30:25,785
is that fair?

1108
01:30:27,119 --> 01:30:29,188
- I don't know.
- Mm.

1109
01:30:29,822 --> 01:30:33,625
Do you realize your country
has left you here to die?

1110
01:30:35,327 --> 01:30:37,797
No, sir, I don't believe that's true.

1111
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,313
Why?

1112
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:56,682
Why?

1113
01:30:57,349 --> 01:31:02,321
Why? For God sake. What have I done?

1114
01:31:02,521 --> 01:31:05,091
I didn't do anything.

1115
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:11,363
I didn't do it, you... you fucking animals!

1116
01:32:27,306 --> 01:32:29,275
You will not touch. Sit down.

1117
01:32:31,277 --> 01:32:32,444
Sit down.

1118
01:32:40,219 --> 01:32:41,854
Oh, my God, darling.

1119
01:32:43,222 --> 01:32:46,258
I know I've been ill,
but I'm on the mend now...

1120
01:32:49,094 --> 01:32:50,362
and this will help.

1121
01:32:52,064 --> 01:32:53,098
This will help.

1122
01:32:53,933 --> 01:32:55,734
- Very much.
- What are they doing?

1123
01:32:55,768 --> 01:32:57,069
What the hell are you people doing to him?

1124
01:32:57,102 --> 01:32:58,437
It's not like that.

1125
01:32:58,737 --> 01:33:02,241
They've been quite respectful
given the circumstance.

1126
01:33:04,176 --> 01:33:05,411
You mustn't fault them.

1127
01:33:06,946 --> 01:33:08,480
Really. You mustn't.

1128
01:33:11,217 --> 01:33:12,484
What you're going through...

1129
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:15,387
it's all so unfair.

1130
01:33:16,288 --> 01:33:17,957
I'm sorry for what happened.

1131
01:33:19,825 --> 01:33:21,260
I feel wretched for doubting you.

1132
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,330
No, no. Couldn't be helped.

1133
01:33:29,802 --> 01:33:33,138
I'm really so glad you're
here. I missed you both...

1134
01:33:34,506 --> 01:33:35,841
very much.

1135
01:33:36,375 --> 01:33:38,177
The foreign office said,
that's a very good sign

1136
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,845
I'm being allowed to visit you.

1137
01:33:40,512 --> 01:33:43,315
- Hmm.
- They said it might...

1138
01:33:43,349 --> 01:33:46,852
it might still take a
while yet to get you home

1139
01:33:47,654 --> 01:33:49,488
since the Russians backed down in Cuba

1140
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:50,889
they're being very stubborn right now.

1141
01:33:50,923 --> 01:33:52,358
What happened in Cuba?

1142
01:33:52,391 --> 01:33:55,127
Well, they removed the missiles.
It's... It's all fine now.

1143
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,395
No more about this.

1144
01:34:13,579 --> 01:34:15,347
And we're trying very hard.

1145
01:34:17,549 --> 01:34:18,817
It might take another...

1146
01:34:20,052 --> 01:34:21,320
it might take another year...

1147
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:23,422
or two.

1148
01:34:31,597 --> 01:34:33,299
Tell me something about home.

1149
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:36,135
Tell me what I have to look forward to.

1150
01:34:39,505 --> 01:34:41,473
Well, the garden's cooperating a bit.

1151
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:43,809
Finally.

1152
01:34:44,644 --> 01:34:47,112
And we have tomatoes this year.

1153
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,050
And Andrew, he...

1154
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:53,319
he passed his Maths exam

1155
01:34:53,585 --> 01:34:55,154
somehow.

1156
01:34:57,156 --> 01:34:58,190
You'd be proud.

1157
01:35:04,496 --> 01:35:05,898
How are you?

1158
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:08,334
I'm...

1159
01:35:09,535 --> 01:35:10,569
I'm all right.

1160
01:35:12,071 --> 01:35:13,138
Really.

1161
01:35:15,474 --> 01:35:17,343
If you can be strong enough for this...

1162
01:35:22,682 --> 01:35:24,116
when you come home...

1163
01:35:26,552 --> 01:35:28,354
I hope we can start again.

1164
01:35:36,528 --> 01:35:38,597
And I was very foolish.

1165
01:35:40,299 --> 01:35:41,300
I'm sorry.

1166
01:35:44,002 --> 01:35:48,073
But I just want you to know
that every moment I've been here,

1167
01:35:48,273 --> 01:35:50,342
I have done nothing but think about

1168
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:52,878
how I'm going to get home to you.

1169
01:35:57,616 --> 01:35:58,617
Really.

1170
01:36:03,589 --> 01:36:04,590
I will.

1171
01:36:07,459 --> 01:36:09,495
I will.

1172
01:36:17,704 --> 01:36:19,405
<i>It's a matter of who.</i>

1173
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:23,008
We can't send someone of real value.

1174
01:36:30,015 --> 01:36:31,016
Not for Wynne.

1175
01:36:31,718 --> 01:36:33,285
Wynne wasn't valuable?

1176
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:35,421
We're all alive, aren't we?

1177
01:36:35,755 --> 01:36:38,056
He's not an officer, is the point.

1178
01:36:38,323 --> 01:36:41,360
If we propose an officer of
theirs that sends a message

1179
01:36:41,393 --> 01:36:44,062
about how we perceive
Wynne the wrong message.

1180
01:36:44,997 --> 01:36:48,701
If you let Wynne die over
there, and he will die,

1181
01:36:48,902 --> 01:36:50,703
a lot sooner than you think.

1182
01:36:51,069 --> 01:36:54,306
No one will ever trust MI6 to protect them.

1183
01:36:54,707 --> 01:36:55,941
Ever again.

1184
01:36:59,445 --> 01:37:00,579
You feel guilty.

1185
01:37:02,047 --> 01:37:03,048
I know.

1186
01:37:03,783 --> 01:37:05,517
But you were doing your job and Wynne

1187
01:37:05,551 --> 01:37:07,519
is our countryman, Emily. I promise...

1188
01:37:09,054 --> 01:37:10,322
we'll get him home.

1189
01:37:19,766 --> 01:37:22,434
If you think Penkovsky will protect you...

1190
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:25,437
you think too highly of him.

1191
01:37:27,372 --> 01:37:29,141
He betrayed his country...

1192
01:37:31,043 --> 01:37:32,077
his family...

1193
01:37:33,512 --> 01:37:34,647
why not you?

1194
01:37:39,485 --> 01:37:42,488
It is every man for himself. Yes?

1195
01:38:00,272 --> 01:38:01,273
Hi.

1196
01:38:04,376 --> 01:38:07,145
I have not seen a mirror for a long time.

1197
01:38:10,717 --> 01:38:13,185
I like to think I'm still quite worth...

1198
01:38:14,854 --> 01:38:16,388
for the time.

1199
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:21,093
I wasn't sure I'd ever see you again.

1200
01:38:23,128 --> 01:38:25,163
I'm so sorry you're here Greville.

1201
01:38:28,133 --> 01:38:31,537
I hope you can forgive me for this...

1202
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:35,675
and for what I had to do.

1203
01:38:37,543 --> 01:38:39,812
What you mean, what you had to do?

1204
01:38:45,517 --> 01:38:46,686
I held back...

1205
01:38:49,187 --> 01:38:50,723
<i>for as long as I could.</i>

1206
01:38:52,157 --> 01:38:54,426
<i>I have to protect
my family, Greville.</i>

1207
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:59,431
To save them, I had to
tell the KGB the truth.

1208
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:02,702
All of the truth.

1209
01:39:08,206 --> 01:39:09,308
I told them...

1210
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:13,312
I gave you pictures that...

1211
01:39:13,913 --> 01:39:17,082
helped Americans find missiles in Cuba.

1212
01:39:28,226 --> 01:39:29,729
And of course I told them...

1213
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:33,766
you didn't know what was
in the packages I gave you.

1214
01:39:52,852 --> 01:39:53,786
Greville...

1215
01:39:57,322 --> 01:40:00,793
I thought I could make
the world a safer place...

1216
01:40:04,529 --> 01:40:05,632
but I failed.

1217
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:08,300
All this...

1218
01:40:11,236 --> 01:40:12,672
betraying my country,

1219
01:40:13,305 --> 01:40:16,743
my people, all for nothing.

1220
01:40:19,544 --> 01:40:20,647
Alex...

1221
01:40:28,253 --> 01:40:29,922
of course I forgive you.

1222
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:34,761
I have to look after my family, too.

1223
01:40:36,495 --> 01:40:38,563
Easier now I know there's not gonna be

1224
01:40:38,597 --> 01:40:39,932
a nuclear war...

1225
01:40:41,366 --> 01:40:43,636
because Khrushchev withdrew his missiles...

1226
01:40:43,836 --> 01:40:46,673
...because of you.

1227
01:40:47,073 --> 01:40:48,407
Because of you.

1228
01:40:49,474 --> 01:40:50,475
You.

1229
01:40:51,044 --> 01:40:54,279
You did it, Alex. You did it.

1230
01:40:54,781 --> 01:40:56,816
You. You did it.

1231
01:40:57,784 --> 01:40:59,819
Because of you, Alex.

1232
01:41:00,585 --> 01:41:01,688
<i>You did it.</i>

1233
01:42:38,818 --> 01:42:40,653
<i>Maybe we're only two people...</i>

1234
01:42:45,758 --> 01:42:47,392
but this is how things change.

1235
01:42:59,404 --> 01:43:01,974
Daddy, where are you?

1236
01:44:11,043 --> 01:44:12,712
<i>Mr. Wynne, you've just
spoken to your wife,</i>

1237
01:44:12,745 --> 01:44:14,013
<i>what were your first words to her</i>

1238
01:44:14,046 --> 01:44:15,580
and what were her first words to you?

1239
01:44:15,614 --> 01:44:17,650
Frankly, we're both rather speechless.

1240
01:44:17,683 --> 01:44:18,985
There were no words for a moment.

1241
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:21,120
Do you have any idea of
what you're going to do

1242
01:44:21,153 --> 01:44:22,587
in the future?

1243
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:26,659
Oh, I want to get back to
my normal business activities

1244
01:44:26,692 --> 01:44:28,761
as soon as I possibly can.

1245
01:44:28,794 --> 01:44:30,428
Well, is that to the same company?

1246
01:44:31,964 --> 01:44:33,565
With my own company.

1247
01:44:33,598 --> 01:44:35,433
Will you travel in East Europe again?

1248
01:44:35,635 --> 01:44:37,069
Oh, now, that is quite a question

1249
01:44:37,103 --> 01:44:39,537
which I can't answer today.

1250
