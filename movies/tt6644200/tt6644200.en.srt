Why did't you let her come?

76
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:56,154
Do you blame her...
for what happened?

77
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,561
Don't...

78
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:17,128
Because she blames herself.

79
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:50,177
It's no one's fault...

80
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,894
You still love her, right?

81
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,335
Of course I do.

82
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,255
You should tell her.

83

88
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,383
You are safe.

89
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:43,668
They can't hear us.

90
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,238
It worked?

91
00:57:49,878 --> 00:57:52,448
You just need to rest now.

92
00:58:01,843 --> 00:58:03,915
Where are they?

93
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,560
Where are they?

94
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,690
I'll find them.

95
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:15,616
She was with me...

96
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:19,610
She was with me and then I had
to go down to laundry.

97
00:58:20,806 --> 00:58:23,186
He was with you, wasn't he?

98
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:24,995
Rockets.

99
00:58:28,452 --> 00:58:31,184
- He'll still be there?
- Surely.

100
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:35,372
He knows he should wait for you.
And she is...

101
00:58:35,373 --> 00:58:38,566
She is smart...
You will find the place...

102
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,867
They know what to do.

103
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:01,628
It's a boy.

104
00:59:03,383 --> 00:59:05,235
It's a boy.

105
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:11,361
I couldn't carred him.

106
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,105
He was heavy, isn't he?

107
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:32,511
Still... I can feel his
weight in my arms...

108
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:38,310
Small, but... So heavy...

109
00:59:45,845 --> 00:59:49,268
And my hands were free...

110
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:56,183
I was carrying the bag...
But my hands were free.

111
00:59:56,184 --> 00:59:58,516
You have to stop.

112
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,415
I'm sorry, I couldn't carred...

113
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:08,140
I should have carred.

114
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:16,429
Who are we?

115
01:00:17,953 --> 01:00:20,480
We can't protect them.

116
01:00:22,192 --> 01:00:24,074

Promise me...

119

120
01:02:56,384 --> 01:03:00,249
<i>Don't worry...

121
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:42,357
<i>We can not stay here.</i>

122
