It's that "You need me
more than I need you" look.

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,368
I'd like to show her she's wrong just for
the evil satisfaction it will give me.

Well, it obviously troubles you.

97
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,045
Yeah, it troubles me a lot, because
what if it's really just a power trip?

98

You know? Yeah, me against her?

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,130
Me against the world?
I really wouldn't worry about that.

The question is
whether you like having her around.

101

I can't stand her.
Well, then get rid of her.

308
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,406
I don't know,
but I think there's a difference.

309
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,882
How old are you?
Thirty-eight.

310
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,326
Why exactly now?

311
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,644
I never had any cash before,
that's a major factor.

312
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,608
And I'm probably getting close
to my use-by date.

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,561
And this is what you wanted
my advice on? Fornication.

314
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,041
Your advice as a friend.

315
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,121
Do I have the deciding vote, so to speak?

316
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,921
Well, let's just say I value your advice
just as much as I do the therapist's.

317
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,365
You're serious about this?

318
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,171
I think sex is a serious matter.

319
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,800
It's one of the most persistent themes
in the Bible.

320
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,884
So...

321
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,646
...is it possible for me
to know a woman...

322
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,929
...in the Biblical sense, so to speak?

323
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,050
And...

324
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,442
And do I want to find out?

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,570
You want my opinion?

326
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,290
Please.

327
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,848
In my heart, I feel like he'll give you
a free pass on this one.

328
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,844
Go for it.
Huh?

329
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,161
Go for it.

330
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,129
Really?
Yes.

331
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,647
If you feel up to it. Do you feel up to it?

332
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,968
To tell you the truth...

333
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,800
...I'm scared.

334
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,246
Well, then, we should pray.

335
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,608
Sweet Jesus...

336
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,010
...Mark and I sit at your feet...

337
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,451
...and pray that you bless
this little journey.

338
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,207
This one small step for a man.

339
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,361
I really feel proud of myself.

340
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,931
Imposing on someone I hardly know
to fornicate in their home.

341
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,206
Get over it.

342
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,488
It's perfectly normal.

343
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,360
Ta-da!
Wow.

in that drawer over there...

346

Oh, that's okay.
I'll bring my own sheets and towels.

No, everything will be provided.

It'll be great karma for the house.

Please. You start.

Although the aim is for us to have sex...

00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,531
...I'm not a prostitute.
You don't have to pay me up front.

I have nothing against prostitutes,
but there's a difference.

We can talk about that later.
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,401
The other thing is, there's a limit
to the number of sessions we can have.

445
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,921
Did Laura mention that
when you saw her?

446
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,686
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

447
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,526
The limit is six, but that gives us
plenty of opportunity to explore.

448
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,920
Six.

449
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,731
So I understand
you're able to have an erection.

450
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,089
Yes, but not by choice.

451
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,604
Do you know how many men there are who
would give anything for a natural erection?

452
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,446
Is this your place?
No, it's a friend's.

453
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,729
The only bedroom furniture
I have at my place is an iron lung.

454
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,407
I've been wondering maybe
about possibly buying a futon...

455
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,928
...you know, in case the need arose.
It might be worth thinking about.

456
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,809
I've got the space, I think.

457
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,770
It can be expensive, though, a nice...

458
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,651
Futon, I mean. How much do you think
a good one would cost?

459
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,280
Because I never...
Mark, take a deep breath.

460
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,490
Yeah.

461
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,645
And let go.

462

<font color="#D900D9">(EXHALES)</font>

463
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,404
Do I seem anxious?
You do a little.

464
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,881
So Laura tells me you're a poet.

465
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,963
What's it like to be a poet?

466
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,129
It's a way of living inside your own head,
which is where I spend most of my time.

467
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,563
But not today.

468
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,166
Nice shirt, by the way.

469
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,526
Thank you.

470
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,490
So I'm gonna ask you
some basic questions, okay?

471
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,803
Sure. Explain to me, so
that I really understand...

472
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,406
...exactly what the iron lung is for.

473
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,329
It keeps me breathing.

474
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,763
I can spend a few hours outside of it
with my portable respirator...

475
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,491
...depending on how I feel...

476
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,246
...but I work and sleep in the iron lung.

477
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,644
And how do you feel right now?

478
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,211
Out of my league.

479
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,486
<font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>

480
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,201
I meant your breathing.
Oh, fine.

481
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,966
In fact, better than usual.
That's great.

482
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,366
Shall we get undressed?

483
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,046
Sure.

484
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,168
So it's good for me...
Be careful.

485
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,570
Did that hurt?

486
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,125
Not yet.

487
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,891
Do you have any areas
of unusual sensitivity?

488
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,566
Any parts of your body
you don't want me to touch?

489
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,405
I have normal sensitivity all over.

490
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,805
I'm not paralyzed exactly.
It's just my muscles don't work too good.

491
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,884
But you could touch me anywhere.

492
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,890
That's great.

493
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,247
Ow! Ow!

494
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,563
Stop! It hurts! It hurts! Holy Mother of God.
What...? What's wrong?

495
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,927
Ahh! My fingers are caught.
It's okay. It's okay.

496
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,766
I've got it. I've got you. Don't worry.
Be careful, please.

497
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:57,083
Mark, I'm gonna be really careful
with you.

498
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,164
I don't want to hurt you or injure you
in any way.

499
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,287
And it's really not sexy when
you yell at me. Okay?

500
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,890
I won't yell at you any more.

501
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,010
But you'll tell me, calmly...

502
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,248
...the minute something starts to hurt.

503
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,291
Yes.

504
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,124
Okay.

505
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,925
Here we go.

506
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,444
Piece of cake. Heh.

507
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,924
Nice shirt.
You already said that.

508
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,566
Did I?

509
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,651
Okay.

510
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,401
I'm gonna slide these down.
Be careful with my feet, okay? My feet.

511
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,210
Be careful.
Hold your breath.

512
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,771
Okay. Whoa. There you go.

513
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,325
Careful. Not so fast.

514
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,368
<font color="#D900D9">(WATER RUNNING)</font>

515
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,204
You ready?

516
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,926
Whoa.

517
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,001
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

518
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,683
So the difference between me
and a prostitute...

519
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,047
...is a prostitute
wants your return business.

520
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,326
I don't.

521
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,211
I'm here to help you
learn about your sexual feelings...

522
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,522
...so you can share them
with a future partner.

523
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,328
Mark, I want you to tell me how it feels each
time I touch a different part of your body.

524
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,370
Okay?
You know, whenever I'm naked...

525
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,925
...everyone else in the room
is always dressed.

526
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,163
Now that I'm in bed with
another naked person, it's very confusing.

527
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,125
Why is it confusing?

528
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,802
I'd always expected that God
or my parents would intervene...

529
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,681
...to keep this moment from ever happening.
Not this time.

530
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,321
So if something feels good,
you tell me.

531
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,563
If something is ticklish or bothers you,
I want you to let me know.

532
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,929
I don't want you to tolerate anything.
Okay.

533
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,686
I'm gonna start with the top
of your head.

534
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,770
You have soft hair.

535
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,762
It's really nice to touch.

536
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,003
Does it feel good?
It does.

537
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,530
That feels weird.

538
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,611
Weird good or weird bad?

539
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,690
Just weird.

540
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,250
That's good.

541
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,243
Still good?
Everything good so far except the ear.

542
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,967
Are these the body awareness
exercises?

543
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,091
You're very clever to have worked that out.
People tell me I'm very perceptive.

544
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,968
Mark, would you like to
see what I feel like?

545
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,965
Sure.

546
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,042
You touch one, you have to touch the other.
It's sort of a rule.

547
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,165
That's a good rule.
Are you wearing cologne?

548
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,245
Yes.
I like it.

549
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,085
I don't usually like cologne,
but I like that.

550
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,528
So, Mark, I'm gonna move my hand
along your body...

551
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,567
...down to your penis, and
if you feel me... Ooh!

552
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,926
<font color="#D900D9">(MOANS)</font>

553
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,041
Oh.
Nice job.

554
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,646
I thought there would be more to it.

555
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,247
Not that it was unpleasant.

556
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,961
After all, I was in bed with a naked woman.

557
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,011
She complimented me on my shirt,
my hair.

558
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,367
She held my penis.

559
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,487
I haven't even seen my penis
for over 30 years.

560
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,568
Am I sharing too much, Father?

561
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,121
No, no. I'm used to it.

562
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,890
So next week.

563
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,725
Friday the 20th, same time?

564
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,325
That's good for me.

565
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,687
Next time, we'll start to work
on intercourse.

566
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,245
Were you afraid at the thought of seeing me?
Oh, God, I was terrified.

567
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,887
You should be proud of yourself.
You did great. We've made real progress.

568
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,930
Can I ask you something?
Sure. What would you like to ask?

569
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,730
Anything, really.

570
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,360
Just tell me something about yourself.

571
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,086
Anything.
Okay.

572
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,847
Um... I'm a very private person.
I have a private life.

573
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,163
I need you to be aware of that.
But that's about it.

574
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,521
This therapy's about you.

575
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,286
<font color="#808080">VERA:</font> Hello.

I hope you guys kept the noise down.

577
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,525
See you then.

578
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,440
What was it like?
How do you feel?

579
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,763
Cleansed and victorious.

580
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,400
Doesn't get any better than that.

581
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,289
How about your first time?

582
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,683
Oh, let me think.
What was it like?

583
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,968
It wasn't all that pleasant.
Oh.

584
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,282
I mean, it was consensual
and everything...

585
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,768
...and I was in love with the guy,
but his dick seemed enormous to me.

586
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,322
I didn't think it would fit.
It was scary.

587
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,450
He was nice. I guess he couldn't help it.

588
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,967
Was he Chinese?
Are you kidding me?

589
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,130
I only dated white guys in high school.
Why is that?

590
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,408
Stick it to my mom and dad,
I suppose.

591
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,211
Are they happy now
you have a Chinese boyfriend?

592
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,488
They're happy. I'm happy.

593
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,571
What's his dick like?

594
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,765
Perfect size.

595
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,120
Why do you call it a
dick instead of a penis?

596
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,087
Dick...

597
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,811
Penis sounds like some vegetable
you don't want to eat.

598
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,327
Heh, heh.
Dick sounds like what it is.

599
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,683
The thing is...

600
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,609
...it was all over so damn quickly.

601
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,525
Yeah, tell me about it.

602
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,365
First session.

603
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,410
Mark O'Brien is the oldest
of four children...

604
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,642
...and raised Catholic.

605
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,042
He was extremely nervous.

606
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,728
He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt,
but I think more out of fear than pain.

607
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,363
He cannot masturbate, has had
only the occasional kissing experience.

608
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,048
He's capable of achieving an erection easily,
but the unusual curvature of his body...

609
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,329
...could be a serious
obstacle to intercourse.

610
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,964
I just started working with this gentleman
who spends almost his entire life...

611
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,442
...trapped in a big metal box.

612
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,048
Did you hear what I said?

613
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,770
Yes. Yes.

614
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,281
And you are a saint.

615
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,886
"Sometimes the head of the penis
may be too large...

616
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,203
...to penetrate the vaginal opening
smoothly...

617
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,961
...in which case the application

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,722
So, what's on the menu
for today?

621
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,564
We're attempting intercourse.

622
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,848
Heh. The big one.

623
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,804
What do you think of it?

624
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,764
Intercourse.

625
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,331
Overrated but necessary.

626
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,324
Plenty of other ways
of achieving the same result.

627
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,007
Somehow you don't feel like you've done it
until you've gone all the way in.

628
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,843
I want you to look at me this time.

629
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,725
Come on, give it a try. Open your eyes.

630
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,690
Do you like watching me undress?

631
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,324
I do.

632
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,882
So from now on...

633
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,840
...you're gonna start to listen
to signals from your body.

634
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,128
That way, you'll be able
to have some control...

635
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,009
Oh, God! Oh, God.

636

637
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,331
Shit.

638
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,522
I did it again.

639
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,407
This time, I ejaculated on her thigh.

640
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,407
I felt cursed.

641
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,005
That the whole enterprise was cursed.

642
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,329
It seemed like a totally just punishment.

643
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,280
God wasn't actually denying
my sexuality.

644
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,841
He was just pointing out to me
how useless it was.

645
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,408
It's amazing to me how often God
is brought into the sex act.

646
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,649
I understand even among nonbelievers...

647
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,243
...the most common expression
of sexual ecstasy is, "Oh, God." Heh.

I want the credit. It was
my overpowering beauty that did it.

651
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,761
It took you by surprise.
Now, where were we?

652
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,449
What do you mean, "Where were we?"

653
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,807
I'm gonna touch you.

654
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,724
I'm touching you.
Okay.

I'm gonna guide you inside me.

657

Is there anything I need to do?

658
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,445
Just close your eyes...

659
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,764

It's not too big. Relax.

662
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,486
No, it won't fit. It'll hurt. It's too risky.

But before I go,
I want you to close your eyes.

778
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,603
Is this a game?
It's not a game.

779
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,326
Just do as I say. Close your eyes.

780

Picture yourself as a 6-year-old boy
at the beach.

And the sound of her tearing off
toilet paper incredibly intimate.

I had a terrific boner.

Raised Catholic, like you...

So, for years,
I didn't believe in anything...

My husband asked me to do it
before his grandmother dies.

The idea is, if it makes her

get an "A" for orgasm.

01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,804
I'm flabbergasted.

1240
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,121
She adores me.

1241
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:18,444
She'll do anything for me,
and I can get pretty kinky sometimes.

1242
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:21,891
Here I was,
ready to offer comfort to the forlorn.

1243
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,441
It's supposed to be my specialty.

1244
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,444
Well, I guess I can throw away
that little speech.

1245
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,208
No, no. Please, make the little speech.

1246
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,361
I'd love to hear it.

1247
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,963
Okay, fine. Here goes.

1248
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,168
The meaning of love.

1249
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,285
Love is a journey.

1250
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,010
I like it already.

1251
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,891
That's it. That's all I've got.
I told you, it's short.

1252
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,884
Love is a journey.
Heh.

01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,084

1255
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,080
<i>We had the same priorities.</i>

1256
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,403
<i>Baseball pretty much came first.</i>

1257
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,404
<i>And we wrote each other mushy poems.</i>

1258
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,042
<i>I never expected it, nor did she...</i>

1259
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,885
<i>...but that's often the
way things turn out.</i>

1262
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,490

empty or half full...</i>

1263
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:46,769
<i>...depending on how you feel about things.</i>

1264

<i>Of course, the two halves were never even.</i>

<i>Not in my case, that's for sure.</i>

1266
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,284
<i>I mean, look at all the years of
unendurable crap I've had to put up with.</i>

1267
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,171
<i>That fills most of the cup.</i>

1268
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,691
<i>But in the little bit that's left...</i>

His was a dynamic voice
in a paralyzed body.

1275
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:26,201
A life lived fully...

1276
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,801
...long after he should have been dead.

1277
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,328
And against all odds,
by Mark's own admission...

1278
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,767
...he knew love.

1279
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,968
Emotional and physical love.

1280
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,326
And in this way, Mark lived his life.

1281

Day by day by day...

...breath by breath by breath.

he loved and he was loved.

will read one of Mark's favorite poems.
