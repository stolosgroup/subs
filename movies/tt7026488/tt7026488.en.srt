3
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,342
Yeah, I...

4
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,378
I can ask my mom when
she gets back on Thursday.

5
00:06:26,412 --> 00:06:29,215
I wouldn't ask my dad,
'cause he'll just say "no"

6
00:06:29,248 --> 00:06:32,017
and give some stupid
arbitrary reason why.

7
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:35,888
You're sure it's okay, though?

8
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,857
Yeah, of course.

9
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,159
What are you gonna
do tonight, though?

10
00:07:15,928 --> 00:07:17,662
Sarah?

11
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:18,550
Fuck yourselves!

12
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:25,858
Freak.
Such a weirdo.

13
00:09:32,598 --> 00:09:34,133
Hey.

14
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,335
- Hey.
- You okay?

15
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:39,471
I'm gonna grab a coffee.
You want anything?

16
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:41,307
Yeah, I'll have another.

17
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:10,129
Sarah?
Come on in.

18
00:11:14,734 --> 00:11:17,136
Have you ever had
any difficulty getting to sleep

19
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:20,038
or staying asleep?

20
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:23,442
Uh, lately. Yes.

21
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,044
Okay.

22
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,413
Do you drink coffee, tea,

23
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,381
or any other
caffeinated beverages?

24
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:31,283
And if so,
how many per day?

25
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,285
Coffee.

26
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:37,189
Usually I'll have about
three to six cups a day.

27
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,624
Okay.

28
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:44,029
Have you ever been diagnosed
with any sleeping disorders?

29
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:46,598
Uh, sleepwalking?
Night terrors? Insomnia?

30
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,501
No.

31
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:53,705
Not officially.

32
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,476
I used to sleepwalk as a kid,
but I haven't in years.

33
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,344
Okay.

34
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:07,052
And you'll be okay to attend
for the full two-month period?

35
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:09,354
- Yes.
- Perfect.

36
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,594
Great.

37
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:23,635
So, we really just
show up and sleep?

38
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,071
Yeah.
That's it.

39
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:29,107
Well, uh, we'll have you
hooked up to a bunch of stuff

40
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,043
and ask you a few questions
every morning.

41
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:32,611
But other than that...

42
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,380
we just need you
lying there in REM.

43
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,282
REM?

44
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,753
Uh, Rapid Eye Movement.

45
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:44,389
It's the stage of sleep
where we dream the most vividly.

46
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,329
Well, thanks for
coming down, Sarah.

47
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,498
I'll send your application
over to our head of faculty

48
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,767
and we'll likely
contact you tomorrow

49
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:57,236
if you're chosen to be
a part of the study.

50
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,071
When would
we be starting?

51
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:00,807
Uh, Monday.

52
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,241
I hope to see you then.

53
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:04,209
Okay, bye.

54
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:19,258
What?

55
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,560
You okay?

56
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,128
Yeah.
I'm good.

57
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:24,831
Really?

58
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,632
Really.

59
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:29,134
'Cause, you know, it would
be okay if you weren't.

60
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,737
I know.

61
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:50,556
You have no idea
how good this feels.

62
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,592
Just to be in a bed and...

63
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,160
in a house.

64
00:13:55,193 --> 00:13:57,563
Thank you.

65
00:14:04,503 --> 00:14:06,305
Goodnight.

66
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,707
Mm.
Sweet dreams.

67
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,597
Can't believe it took me
this long to figure out

68
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,366
how to make money
when sleeping.

69
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,003
I'm sure your wife
is more than happy

70
00:16:51,037 --> 00:16:52,471
with the peace and quiet.

71
00:16:52,504 --> 00:16:54,841
- Well, I know I am.

72
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:03,482
Um, are, uh...

73
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:06,318
are you the only girl
in this study?

74
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:08,453
Uh, no, there's
another in my room. Emily.

75
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,588
Oh, cool.

76
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,623
Is this your first
sleeping clinic?

77
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,893
Yup.

78
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:15,327
You guys?

79
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,863
Yeah.

80
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,030
I've done a couple.

81
00:17:20,032 --> 00:17:21,500
Oh, hey.

82
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,814
What about you?

83
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:35,882
I've, uh...

84
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:38,650
I've been coming to these
things since I was five.

85
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,953
Aaron and I
actually go way back.

86
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:45,357
I was 16 when I
first started coming here.

87
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:50,529
I guess ol' Meyer
loves to see us sleep.

88
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:55,333
Meyer?

89
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,402
Doctor Meyer.
He's, uh...

90
00:17:57,435 --> 00:17:59,671
He's head of the department.
You guys will meet him later.

91
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,574
He, uh, usually does
the exit interviews.

92
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,133
Perfect fit.

93
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,969
Come, sit down and we'll
get your headset on.

94
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,109
Everyone has to wear these?

95
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:39,145
I'm afraid so.

96
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:41,981
It's how we get
the information from you

97
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:44,750
over to us
in the control room.

98
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:49,554
Okay...

99
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:21,153
Excuse me?

100
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,122
Hi, sorry, um...

101
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,724
Michael told me to
come down this way.

102
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:26,625
Yeah, hi, Emily.

103
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,860
You're in the right place,
don't worry.

104
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,762
You can just have a seat and
I'll be with you in one second.

105
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:31,529
Okay.
Thank you.

106
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:38,838
- Hi.
- Hey.

107
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,477
How many of us
are in the study?

108
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,513
Uh, six.
Two females and four males.

109
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:52,584
How come there's more guys?

110
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:55,087
I can't tell you that.

111
00:19:56,956 --> 00:19:58,958
Well, what are you studying?

112
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:01,193
I can't tell you that either.

113
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,898
I told you to hurry.

114
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:08,200
Well, Riff had me
installing the new drivers.

115
00:20:08,234 --> 00:20:09,969
It's okay.
You can watch me do Emily's,

116
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,938
and then I'll get you to help
apply the guys' next door.

117
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,672
- Cool.
- Okay.

118
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:15,707
- Hi.
- Hey.

119
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,077
I'll get Sarah
up and running

120
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:18,978
so you can start
with Emily now.

121
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,080
Great. Thank you.

122
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:28,854
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

123
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,231
You're almost set.

124
00:20:55,014 --> 00:20:57,016
How long till
we're ready to go?

125
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,683
I'd say
about another hour

126
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,820
before everyone's
connected and settled.

127
00:21:00,853 --> 00:21:03,189
Okay.
Great.

128
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:21,874
Stage one,

129
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:23,508
the eyes close.

130
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,646
A reduction in activity
between wakefulness.

131
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:33,753
The patient can be awakened
without difficulty,

132
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:36,756
but if woken at this stage,

133
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:40,026
the person will not feel
as if they have slept.

134
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:44,296
Many have
a feeling of falling

135
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,599
during the first five
to ten minutes of sleep,

136
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:50,936
which can cause a sudden
muscle contraction called...?

137
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,304
Hypnic myoclonia?

138
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:54,340
Very good, Lyle.

139
00:21:54,373 --> 00:21:57,777
Now, watch the EEG and the EOG.

140
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,179
Some of them are
entering stage two.

141
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:05,217
We'll now see
some peaks and valleys

142
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:07,319
indicating periods
of muscle tone

143
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:09,822
and muscle relaxation.

144
00:22:10,923 --> 00:22:14,326
The SYNC will also show us
a slowing of the heart rate

145
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,829
and a decrease
in core temperature.

146
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:21,367
Their bodies are preparing
them for deep sleep.

147
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,944
Stage
three and four...

148
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:34,046
Slow wave...

149
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,680
Delta.

150
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:40,352
Wake them now,
and for a moment,

151
00:22:40,386 --> 00:22:43,189
they'll have no idea
where they are.

152
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,893
Now we wait.

153
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:52,832
In a bit, we'll start
seeing some entry into REM.

154
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:12,084
It's like clockwork.

155
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:15,387
Yes. Well, for most
people it is.

156
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,992
Are we ready?

157
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,994
Recording.

158
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:40,613
There.

159
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:44,316
Whose feed is that?

160
00:23:46,752 --> 00:23:49,989
That's in A.
Sarah Dunn.

161
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,979
And... do you
feel well rested?

162
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,916
Yeah, I do actually.

163
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,818
Uh, more rested
or less rested

164
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,121
than you usually feel
when sleeping at home?

165
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:58,991
Definitely more rested.

166
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:01,060
That's great.

167
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:02,328
Now just a few more questions

168
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:03,529
and then we'll be
done for today.

169
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:05,798
Okay.

170
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,947
That good, huh?

171
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:28,180
I read that
in one sitting.

172
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,882
Hm.

173
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:32,451
Couldn't put it down.

174
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:35,087
It's really good.

175
00:26:36,989 --> 00:26:38,324
Yeah?

176
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:40,592
Hm.
There's a...

177
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:43,062
a kind of...

178
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,830
a haunting sadness to it.

179
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,465
You should definitely buy it.

180
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,968
Have you read much
Philip K. Dick?

181
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:52,471
No, not... not much.

182
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:55,474
He was
completely paranoid.

183
00:26:55,507 --> 00:26:57,543
Genius concepts, though.

184
00:27:00,379 --> 00:27:02,848
His stuff will make you think.

185
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:06,218
Thanks.

186
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,387
I'll give him a try.

187
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,956
You won't be sorry.

188
00:28:08,614 --> 00:28:09,581
You have to
get me a job there

189
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,450
because I'm practically
a professional sleeper!

190
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,685
If I got paid to sleep,
I can't even imagine...

191
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,020
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

192
00:28:15,053 --> 00:28:15,889
What?

193
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:17,156
I'm trying
to avoid that guy.

194
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:18,457
- Who?
- The...

195
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,326
Up there in the trench coat
and the glasses.

196
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,295
I met him in
a bookstore earlier.

197
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,997
I just...

198
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,065
I just don't feel like being
social, okay? Come on.

199
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,367
Okay.

200
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,704
You like him.

201
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,940
Shut up!

202
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,212
Okay, lie down.

203
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:46,585
All set.

204
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:49,354
Um, Anita will be by in a bit.

205
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:52,624
Is Emily coming tonight?

206
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:55,461
Uh, she's probably
just running late.

207
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:56,628
Or dropped out.

208
00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:59,264
It happens all the time
on these things.

209
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,602
Goodnight, Sarah.

210
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:05,103
'Night.

211
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:41,126
And... this one?

212
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,333
No.

213
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,369
Nothing.

214
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:54,673
So, you have no reaction
to this image, correct?

215
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,743
Correct.

216
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:58,410
Okay.

217
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:06,786
To be honest, I can't really
tell what any of these are.

218
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:08,420
Yes, we know.

219
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:10,823
Bear with us.

220
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:26,773
I still don't really see or...

221
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,540
or feel anything.

222
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:41,888
Uh...

223
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:47,794
I mean... some hands,
maybe, holding something?

224
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:09,481
Is Emily still in the study?

225
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:11,751
Probably not.

226
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,754
Is something wrong?

227
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:16,588
No.

228
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,893
People usually lose interest
after the first couple nights.

229
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,595
You know, realize they don't
like sleeping in a strange place

230
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,732
or whatever, but...

231
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,900
we'll have a replacement
in Room A as soon as we can.

232
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:30,937
So you... you...
you talked to her, right?

233
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,372
No.

234
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:38,010
But this happens all the time.

235
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:39,979
There are no-shows
in every cycle. It's just part...

236
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:42,447
Guys...

237
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:44,382
I'm sorry, but we have
four more of these to do

238
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,585
until I get to
go home and sleep.

239
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:55,762
Okay, Sarah.
Last one for today.

240
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,651
Sarah?

241
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,053
Sarah, are you...?

242
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,089
Get Riff!
Hurry!

243
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,441
Is she okay?

244
00:34:43,843 --> 00:34:45,677
She seems to be now.

245
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,653
No...

246
00:35:09,135 --> 00:35:11,570
I wasn't following you.

247
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:12,872
Really?

248
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:17,442
Then how come I kept
seeing you everywhere?

249
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,477
Hm...

250
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:23,850
You were sitting there...

251
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:26,585
watching me sleep.

252
00:35:26,618 --> 00:35:28,486
And you just thought,
"Hey...

253
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,157
"Since I don't ever
leave my nerd den,

254
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,160
"this is probably my best chance
to meet the future Mrs. Nerd,

255
00:35:34,193 --> 00:35:36,162
"so if I just
follow her around,

256
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:39,999
"maybe she'll fall for my
magical fucking nerd charms!"

257
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:55,480
Please don't quit our study
on account of my actions.

258
00:35:55,513 --> 00:36:01,153
I'm not quitting
because of you.

259
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:03,789
I'm quitting because I just
had the worst panic attack

260
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:08,526
of my life and none of you
people will tell me why.

261
00:36:11,197 --> 00:36:12,530
Okay, Sarah.

262
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:15,500
Last one for today.

263
00:36:16,936 --> 00:36:18,670
Sarah?

264
00:36:18,703 --> 00:36:19,872
Sarah, are you...?

265
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:21,774
Get Riff!
Hurry!

266
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:25,644
And what did you
think would happen

267
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:29,648
when you showed
these images to her?

268
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:30,515
I...

269
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:33,518
Dr. MEYER: This isn't
a joke, Anita.

270
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:36,188
This is the first time
anyone has ever done this.

271
00:36:36,222 --> 00:36:39,524
And we have to be more than
careful about how it's handled.

272
00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:41,761
We'll either be
hailed or crucified

273
00:36:41,794 --> 00:36:44,696
based on our treatment
of this breakthrough.

274
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:45,865
We never...

275
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:48,200
There's no more
unauthorized testing, Anita.

276
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:50,937
I don't care what Riff says.

277
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,173
We just wanted to see
if they remember.

278
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:56,909
Well, it's obvious
that they do.

279
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:58,945
So...

280
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:02,214
let's go back to acting
like scientists again, okay?

281
00:37:02,248 --> 00:37:04,516
Now, that means
collecting the data

282
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:09,654
and then studying it
within the bounds of decency.

283
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:14,260
We won't deviate
from your methods again.

284
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:17,562
Thank you.

285
00:37:17,595 --> 00:37:20,132
I'll be by later tonight
to monitor.

286
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:13,252
Hey.

287
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:20,126
Zo?

288
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,161
Hello?

289
00:38:46,252 --> 00:38:48,921
Young lady!
Wake up! Wake up!

290
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:52,624
I didn't want to wake you,
but those boys,

291
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:55,161
they stole something from you.

292
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,362
What?

293
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:58,230
The boys, they took
something from you,

294
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:01,200
and then they ran off,
so I woke you.

295
00:39:01,233 --> 00:39:05,637
How long was I...

296
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,706
Fuck!

297
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:16,348
Oh, no, no, no...

298
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:36,936
Zoe? Zoe!

299
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:44,210
Please be home.
Please be home.

300
00:39:44,243 --> 00:39:47,413
Zo!
Zo, come on!

301
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:49,714
Zoe, come on, please.

302
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:03,295
Hey, nerd!

303
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,905
Hey.

304
00:40:12,938 --> 00:40:17,910
What were those pictures
Anita showed me this morning?

305
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:21,447
I can't tell you that.

306
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,383
I'm not coming back
till you do.

307
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:27,920
So, you're not quitting?

308
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:31,723
I won't quit or tell anyone
you were stalking me...

309
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:33,259
If... if...?

310
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,895
If you tell me
what you're studying.

311
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:39,899
- It's not happening.
- Please.

312
00:40:39,932 --> 00:40:43,335
I'm starting to
get scared, okay?

313
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:47,306
Ever since this morning, it's...

314
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:53,179
I have never felt so weird.

315
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:54,914
But if I show you, it...

316
00:40:54,947 --> 00:40:56,749
it could completely
compromise the results...

317
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:57,783
No, listen to me.

318
00:40:57,816 --> 00:41:00,953
I think your science project
is fucking me up!

319
00:41:04,523 --> 00:41:07,226
If I leave, doesn't that
compromise your results?

320
00:41:17,203 --> 00:41:20,039
All right, come on.

321
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:21,974
Come on!

322
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,794
I'm not kidding.

323
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:45,331
If I show this to you...

324
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:47,099
you cannot tell anyone.

325
00:41:57,243 --> 00:41:59,378
First off...

326
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:02,948
you'll notice that I'm
putting this on my own head...

327
00:42:02,982 --> 00:42:04,116
so that you'll trust me
that there's nothing

328
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:06,118
to be afraid of.

329
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,557
Now, a few years ago,
some brilliant neuroscientist

330
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,126
from Berkeley figured out
a way to decode the images

331
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,995
our minds process...

332
00:42:16,028 --> 00:42:19,164
um, what we see...

333
00:42:19,198 --> 00:42:21,333
and export the data...

334
00:42:25,904 --> 00:42:32,278
...as a moving image.

335
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:34,413
No way.

336
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:45,457
That is so cool.

337
00:42:45,491 --> 00:42:52,264
It is!

338
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:54,400
And... and I immediately thought
about where we could apply it.

339
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,402
So I spent the last few years
tweaking this loaner

340
00:42:56,435 --> 00:43:00,439
to make it able to see
things even more amazing.

341
00:43:09,982 --> 00:43:13,319
You guys are
watching our dreams?

342
00:43:13,352 --> 00:43:15,487
Yes!

343
00:43:26,332 --> 00:43:28,100
Obviously
I can't show you yours,

344
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:30,169
as we've already seen
what potentially happens

345
00:43:30,202 --> 00:43:35,207
when even a single frame
is recounted by the dreamer.

346
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,077
I think I can safely cue up
a feed of someone else's

347
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:39,611
from last night.

348
00:43:54,026 --> 00:43:56,095
Those are his dreams?

349
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:57,930
No.
No, he's still falling asleep.

350
00:43:57,963 --> 00:44:00,666
See?

351
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:03,635
These are hypnagogic
experiences.

352
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:06,372
It's his brain trying to
make sense of the reduced input

353
00:44:06,405 --> 00:44:12,111
it's receiving as he
loses consciousness.

354
00:44:12,144 --> 00:44:14,980
That is so weird.

355
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:17,249
And fascinating.

356
00:44:17,282 --> 00:44:19,251
Look at the pictures
and the shapes

357
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:23,355
left floating around
in his mind.

358
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:26,024
It's actually quite beautiful.

359
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:37,669
If I remember correctly, I...

360
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:40,005
I think he had a pretty
scary dream off the top.

361
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:42,541
I might have to cut it short.

362
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:06,658
Are my dreams that messed up?

363
00:46:06,692 --> 00:46:10,095
Sometimes.

364
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:11,296
We all have nightmares.

365
00:46:25,677 --> 00:46:27,412
This is nuts.

366
00:46:35,687 --> 00:46:37,824
Don't you ever feel like
you're seeing something

367
00:46:37,857 --> 00:46:41,794
that you're not supposed to?

368
00:46:41,828 --> 00:46:48,400
I... I wouldn't be doing this if
I didn't have a reason, Sarah.

369
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:49,501
Which is?

370
00:46:52,538 --> 00:46:55,407
Fuck.
Uh, we... we have to go.

371
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,441
Come on.

372
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:08,287
I held up my end...

373
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:21,600
See you inside.

374
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:20,880
That's new.

375
00:50:20,913 --> 00:50:23,015
It is.

376
00:50:23,049 --> 00:50:27,319
Let's clean it up a bit.

377
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:53,712
How is this happening?

378
00:50:56,783 --> 00:50:58,683
They all have their own
unique hypnagogic

379
00:50:58,717 --> 00:51:03,923
and narrative episodes,
but eventually...

380
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:06,691
they end up here like this.

381
00:51:28,114 --> 00:51:29,916
I've been seeing these
things in my own dreams

382
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,985
since I was six years old.

383
00:51:33,019 --> 00:51:35,720
There's countless records
throughout history,

384
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:37,990
across varying cultures
and yet for some reason

385
00:51:38,024 --> 00:51:41,928
we always figure out a way
to simply discount them as...

386
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:43,763
just dreams.

387
00:51:46,732 --> 00:51:48,835
It's fucking scary

388
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:51,703
finding what really
makes us tick.

389
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:17,730
Lyle, can you grab this in 4K?

390
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:32,044
- Dunn's coming out of REM.
- Fuck!

391
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:34,512
Her pulse is
really fucking elevated.

392
00:52:57,036 --> 00:52:59,005
Sarah?

393
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:00,505
Sarah!

394
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,216
Sarah, are you okay?

395
00:53:10,249 --> 00:53:14,552
Fuck this place!
No, I'm not okay!

396
00:53:14,586 --> 00:53:16,188
Look, you
just had a nightmare.

397
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:18,556
I know
I had a nightmare!

398
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,797
What was it about, Anita?
Huh?

399
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,631
Did you see them?

400
00:53:28,834 --> 00:53:31,837
Yeah, I know what you're doing
so you can shut the fuck up!

401
00:53:31,871 --> 00:53:33,005
I'm fucking done with this!

402
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,809
I'll be right back.
Keep watching the others!

403
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:39,678
Sarah!

404
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,949
Your eye.

405
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:50,722
What is going on, Riff?!

406
00:53:53,859 --> 00:53:55,828
- Nothing.
- Meyer's coming in at 2!

407
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,996
What do I tell him?!

408
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,597
Keep monitoring the others!
I'll be back before then!

409
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,716
Bill!

410
00:55:58,751 --> 00:55:59,852
Is Zoe here tonight?

411
00:55:59,885 --> 00:56:01,053
Might be.
I just got here.

412
00:56:01,087 --> 00:56:03,155
Can I go in and check?

413
00:56:15,968 --> 00:56:19,105
- He has two minutes.
- Yep.

414
00:56:19,138 --> 00:56:22,875
Then he's gonna explain to us
how she knew.

415
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:26,345
Yes. He is.

416
00:56:26,378 --> 00:56:29,381
I think one of
the guys in C is waking up.

417
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:36,989
It's Will.

418
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,757
They're both waking up.

419
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:49,301
No...

420
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:51,103
Look at the room...

421
00:56:51,137 --> 00:56:55,841
Their vitals.

422
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,143
It's happening.

423
00:57:04,283 --> 00:57:06,285
Lyle, get Riff.
Right now!

424
00:57:17,429 --> 00:57:19,765
What's going on?

425
00:58:31,837 --> 00:58:32,738
Where's Riff again?

426
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:35,241
He had to run home
for something,

427
00:58:35,274 --> 00:58:39,378
but he should
be back any minute.

428
00:58:39,411 --> 00:58:42,982
Well, I just
don't want him to miss this.

429
00:58:43,015 --> 00:58:46,118
This is exactly what
he's been waiting for.

430
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:41,974
Hey!
Is she okay?

431
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:17,042
I feel bad about having
them go through this.

432
01:00:17,076 --> 01:00:19,111
Must be horrible.

433
01:00:19,144 --> 01:00:21,480
It is.

434
01:00:21,513 --> 01:00:24,316
But this is a natural function.

435
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,584
And if we're going
to understand it,

436
01:00:25,617 --> 01:00:28,220
we need this data.

437
01:00:28,253 --> 01:00:30,089
These images...

438
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:35,361
they prove a kind of a primal
connection to this icon.

439
01:00:35,394 --> 01:00:39,932
A unified fear of
this shadow with eyes.

440
01:01:12,164 --> 01:01:15,167
Their vitals
aren't changing.

441
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,505
Discreetly get in there
and re-connect their SYNCS.

442
01:01:19,538 --> 01:01:21,573
Should we wake them?

443
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:41,160
There.

444
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:02,181
No fuckin' way.

445
01:02:02,214 --> 01:02:03,482
What?

446
01:02:10,489 --> 01:02:11,490
Michael...

447
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:17,429
Michael, what is it?

448
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:31,616
Wake up!

449
01:11:31,649 --> 01:11:35,287
Wake up!
Wake up!

450
01:11:35,321 --> 01:11:37,923
You gotta wake up!
You gotta wake up!

451
01:11:57,675 --> 01:11:59,912
Hey.

452
01:11:59,945 --> 01:12:02,882
Hey.

453
01:13:06,145 --> 01:13:08,347
Um, I'll be right back.

454
01:13:46,485 --> 01:13:49,321
Oh, weird question.

455
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:54,760
Can I sleep on
your couch tonight?

456
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:57,163
Of course.

457
01:13:57,196 --> 01:14:00,733
I lost my phone.

458
01:14:00,766 --> 01:14:03,869
And I have nowhere else to go.

459
01:14:25,324 --> 01:14:27,226
Why "Riff"?

460
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:31,197
You ever see
the Rocky Horror?

461
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:34,066
Of course.

462
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:39,338
You remember Riff-Raff?

463
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,074
Oh...

464
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:45,444
I get it.
You're Meyer's Igor.

465
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,517
You know,
you're smart for your age.

466
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:53,085
I'm 18.

467
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:06,198
I saw your dream.

468
01:16:54,473 --> 01:16:57,042
Sarah?

469
01:16:57,076 --> 01:16:58,344
Oh, Sarah...

470
01:17:17,563 --> 01:17:21,633
Are there any relatives,
next-of-kin we can contact?

471
01:17:21,667 --> 01:17:24,670
I don't know.
I don't know her very well.

472
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:48,173
Hello?!

473
01:20:48,206 --> 01:20:50,409
Nurse!

474
01:20:56,515 --> 01:20:57,784
Hello?!

475
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:07,860
Where is everyone?

476
01:21:07,894 --> 01:21:08,861
On the second floor,
I... I...

477
01:21:08,895 --> 01:21:10,562
I have a friend that's
being treated up there

478
01:21:10,596 --> 01:21:11,731
and I don't know
where she is now.

479
01:21:11,764 --> 01:21:13,498
There's no nurses
at the front desk.

480
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:14,600
What's your friend's name?

481
01:21:14,633 --> 01:21:17,469
Dunn.
Sarah Dunn.

482
01:21:17,502 --> 01:21:20,205
- Sarah...
- Dunn.

483
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:22,775
Sarah... Dunn.

484
01:21:22,809 --> 01:21:24,877
She's in 237.

485
01:21:24,911 --> 01:21:26,012
No!
No, she's not.

486
01:21:26,045 --> 01:21:28,380
She's... that's what I'm
telling you, she's not there!

487
01:21:28,413 --> 01:21:30,349
Sir, please calm down.

488
01:21:30,382 --> 01:21:32,351
We will find out
where she is.

489
01:21:32,384 --> 01:21:33,485
Let me call a nurse
on the second...

490
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:34,921
But there's
no one up there!

491
01:21:34,954 --> 01:21:36,923
I'm tell...
I'm telling you.

492
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:50,636
Jerry, can you run up
to the second and

493
01:21:50,669 --> 01:21:52,872
find Rachel or Kiki for me?

494
01:21:52,905 --> 01:21:56,809
This gentleman's looking
for a patient's whereabouts.

495
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:58,644
I told you there's
no one up there.

496
01:21:58,677 --> 01:21:59,946
They
probably had to move her

497
01:21:59,979 --> 01:22:01,914
due to tonight's
staffing shortage.

498
01:22:01,948 --> 01:22:04,416
Um, why don't you take
a seat over by the desk

499
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:08,387
and I'll give you a call
when we have her new location.

500
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,255
Okay, thanks.
I just...

501
01:22:10,288 --> 01:22:12,357
I'm... I'm just...
I'm worried about her.

502
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,377
Sarah!

503
01:23:43,783 --> 01:23:46,251
Sarah!
It's me, Jeremy!

504
01:23:50,555 --> 01:23:52,992
Sarah!

505
01:24:05,905 --> 01:24:06,906
Sarah...

506
01:24:11,676 --> 01:24:12,677
Sarah...

507
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:20,552
It's me, Jeremy.

508
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:22,955
Wake up.

509
01:24:25,925 --> 01:24:27,392
Wake up.

510
01:24:31,563 --> 01:24:32,832
Augh!

511
01:24:50,983 --> 01:24:53,552
Where the fuck
have you been?!

512
01:24:53,585 --> 01:24:55,822
Look, I can't explain right now.
Are you at the lab?

513
01:24:55,855 --> 01:24:59,091
Yes! I'm here
and I'm cleaning up your mess.

514
01:24:59,125 --> 01:25:01,326
I... I really
need you right now.

515
01:25:01,961 --> 01:25:05,832
No! No! You have
fucked up all of our lives!

516
01:25:05,865 --> 01:25:07,432
We'll be lucky if we
ever do another study...

517
01:25:07,465 --> 01:25:08,734
I know, I'm sorry,
it's just...

518
01:25:08,768 --> 01:25:09,869
<i>something's happened
to Sarah Dunn and I...</i>

519
01:25:09,902 --> 01:25:11,703
<i>I just really need
you to come out...</i>

520
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:14,539
What did you do?

521
01:25:17,009 --> 01:25:18,744
I really fucked up.

522
01:25:19,145 --> 01:25:21,346
Just one more thing
and we're done.

523
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:24,616
Anita, please.

524
01:25:25,985 --> 01:25:28,855
Then we're done.

525
01:27:04,716 --> 01:27:07,585
- What the fuck, Riff?!
- Where's the stuff?

526
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:09,021
The trunk.

527
01:27:43,122 --> 01:27:45,257
Why don't we take
her back to the hospital?

528
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,259
'Cause
she's not safe there.

529
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:48,593
They have no clue
what's happening to her.

530
01:27:48,626 --> 01:27:50,495
No more than we do.

531
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:55,667
It's up.

532
01:28:10,750 --> 01:28:12,617
It's a nightmare.

533
01:28:13,953 --> 01:28:17,323
It's... it's good.
It can help us get her out.

534
01:28:17,356 --> 01:28:19,825
You keep watching her.
I'll make sure that she's safe.

535
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:14,712
So, we try to wake her at
the height of her nightmare?

536
01:29:15,848 --> 01:29:17,116
Yes.

537
01:29:18,716 --> 01:29:20,652
The body tries to
reject death in dreams.

538
01:29:20,685 --> 01:29:22,221
You wake up.

539
01:29:22,687 --> 01:29:24,622
What if you're wrong?

540
01:29:26,859 --> 01:29:28,761
I don't know.

541
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:07,733
Anything?

542
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:09,401
Nothing yet.

543
01:30:10,236 --> 01:30:13,839
Look, how much further should
we really let her continue...

544
01:30:13,873 --> 01:30:15,407
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

545
01:31:18,938 --> 01:31:21,073
This isn't
making any sense.

546
01:31:21,106 --> 01:31:22,474
I thought she was headed
somewhere familiar, or...

547
01:31:22,508 --> 01:31:24,709
Wait!
I see something.

548
01:31:57,843 --> 01:32:00,379
I've never seen or
dreamt of this many before.

549
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:05,117
When one of them comes
close or touches her,

550
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,519
she'll expel herself
from the dream.

551
01:33:28,067 --> 01:33:30,069
Riff, I don't want
to do this anymore.

552
01:33:30,102 --> 01:33:32,304
Let's call a cab, okay?
Let's get out of here, leave!

553
01:33:38,977 --> 01:33:40,646
Just...
just keep watching.

554
01:34:34,066 --> 01:34:35,334
Sarah...

555
01:34:35,869 --> 01:34:38,404
Hey, I'm right here.
I'm here.

556
01:34:38,437 --> 01:34:41,306
What happened?

557
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,443
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

558
01:34:44,476 --> 01:34:46,712
We couldn't wake you...

559
01:34:46,746 --> 01:34:48,514
We couldn't wake you.

560
01:34:48,547 --> 01:34:51,049
You saw?

561
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:54,019
- You saw?
- Yes.

562
01:34:58,624 --> 01:35:00,492
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

563
01:35:03,562 --> 01:35:07,266
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

564
01:35:39,732 --> 01:35:42,201
Are you certain this
is the way that we came in?

565
01:35:46,773 --> 01:35:48,507
Where did you get this?

566
01:35:49,809 --> 01:35:52,511
I found it
out in the field.

567
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:54,279
This is my phone.

568
01:35:55,748 --> 01:35:57,583
You lost it out here?

569
01:35:57,616 --> 01:35:59,451
I've never been here!

570
01:35:59,485 --> 01:36:01,587
Look, maybe you've had
an episode like this before

571
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:03,121
and you came and you dropped...

572
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:03,722
What time is it?

573
01:36:09,628 --> 01:36:11,096
What the fuck?

574
01:36:13,265 --> 01:36:15,133
What time
does it say it is?

575
01:36:45,697 --> 01:36:47,699
Run!

576
01:36:54,841 --> 01:36:57,676
No!
No...

577
01:37:03,148 --> 01:37:04,683
Just keep breathing.

578
01:37:07,553 --> 01:37:09,521
No...!

579
01:42:29,224 --> 01:42:34,224
