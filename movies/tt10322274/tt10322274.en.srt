00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
<i>You have to become one with the car.</i>

3
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,440
<i>You should know exactly
how much stress you can give to the car.</i>

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,560
<i>Because there's a limit always,</i>

5
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,160
<i>and you should be careful,
like with everything in life you like,</i>

6
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,960
<i>you have to have that kind of feeling
to not go over the top or not be under it.</i>

7
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,400
<i>And if you do that,
then both of us will be satisfied.</i>

8
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,600
<i>The car and I.</i>

9
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,560
<i>100% perfection.</i>

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,960
<i>To reach 100%, that's... that's my target.</i>

11
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
<i>I'm just that type of person.</i>

12
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,760
<i>I couldn't live with anything lower.</i>

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,400
<i>I don't like to talk about
my quality very much</i>

14
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>because I would sound arrogant.</i>

15
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,160
<i>And I don't like to talk about my failures
because it's your job to find them.</i>

16
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,360
<i>There was a real air
of excitement in the paddock.</i>

17
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,200
<i>Everybody's aware of who's coming up
through the system.</i>

18
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,280
<i>We had a sense that this was someone
who's looking very promising.</i>

19
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,040
<i>When Michael came into Formula One,
this was a time when there were big names.</i>

20
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,520
<i>Senna was World Champion with McLaren,</i>

21
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,720
<i>Mansell was driving for Williams,</i>

22
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,760
<i>Uh, Prost was at Ferrari.
You know, those are really big names.</i>

23
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,920
All the drivers were over 27, 28<i>,</i>

24
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,320
with a lot of experience.

25
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,160
And Michael was the young one.

26
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,680
When Michael arrived,
all the drivers looked at him like,

27
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,640
"Too young, too early, too soon."

28
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,560
<i>Most Formula One drivers come up</i>

29
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,760
<i>through karts, Formula Three.</i>

30
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,320
<i>And he'd been helped
in making the transition to Formula One</i>

31
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,520
<i>by having raced sports cars for Mercedes.</i>

32
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,480
Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,080
Luck got him into Formula One.

34
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,760
A driver had dropped out,
and they needed a new one.

35
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,360
<i>Michael appeared in Formula One
through a stroke of luck, really,</i>

36
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,160
w<i>hen Eddie Jordan had a seat available,</i>

37
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,480
<i>all of a sudden,
partway through the season.</i>

38
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,376
After I found out, I immediately

39
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,480
got on the phone and called Eddie Jordan.

40
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,920
I said, "Eddie, you've got to
give me that chance."

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,840
And he said,
"Who in the hell is Michael Schumacher?"

42
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,960
I said, "You got to remember.
Formula Three, won Macau, won Fuji."

43
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,680
"Okay, now I know."

44
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,200
I've seen him in Formula Three.

45
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,400
And I have this...
or the team has this attitude

46
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,680
to give youth a chance.
And that's the way our team is formed.

47
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,960
<i>Just everything that lay ahead of us,</i>

48
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
<i>just the possibility that he could show</i>

49
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,440
<i>what he was really capable of,</i>

50
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,440
<i>that was so incredible,
but we had no idea.</i>

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,920
<i>That evening we sat out on a square
and ate pizza, undisturbed.</i>

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,880
<i>The place was packed.
I think four-to five-hundred people.</i>

53
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,760
<i>And no one came up to us.</i>

54
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,520
<i>That was the last time
that nobody bothered us.</i>

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,640
<i>I remember you could hear
the people in the Tannoy...</i>

56
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,200
<i>...describing
what's happening in qualifying.</i>

57
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,880
<i>And this name,
Michael Schumacher, kept popping up.</i>

58
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,400
<i>Well, he was... he was a sensation.</i>

59
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,560
<i>When Michael qualified seventh,
it was just like,</i>

60
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,560
<i>"Wow! Here is a new star!"</i>

61
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,640
<i>Everybody was just so excited</i>

62
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,800
<i>that this new driver
had exploded onto the scene.</i>

63
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm really happy.

64
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,560
But anyway, I have to say,

65
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,640
with this car you can do
this qualifying time, you know.

66
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,280
It makes a lot of fun to drive.

67
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,680
And also for the time,
I'm really happy, yeah.

68
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,440
<i>Everybody noticed that.
Everybody in other teams noticed that.</i>

69
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>You know,
he became immediately a hot property.</i>

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,880
After the race in Spa,
I called Willi Weber.

71
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,800
And we met with Michael,
I think on Monday.

72
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Monday or Tuesday in London.

73
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,960
At the time, our team
was already fighting for podium.

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,320
We weren't fighting for a Championship,

75
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,160
but on some occasions
we got close to the podium.

76
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,920
So we signed an agreement.

77
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,480
<i>It cam</i> e s <i>uddenly. I was totally surprised.</i>

78
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,080
<i>I'd just driven my first race,</i>

79
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,720
<i>and the fourth-best team
in the world makes me an offer.</i>

80
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,040
<i>I was gobsmacked.</i>

81
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,640
<i>I was stunned
that it could happen so fast,</i>

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>and I was so happy about the contract.</i>

83
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,680
<i>It was an absolutely fantastic situation.</i>

84
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,600
<i>He had this freshness about him.</i>

85
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
<i>You know, his skin
was very tight on his face</i>

86
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,800
<i>and always very clean-shaven.</i>

87
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,200
<i>And he just radiated this confidence.</i>

88
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,320
<i>Michael was racing
as a boy against hard men.</i>

89
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,720
<i>And it's Schumacher in fourth position</i>

90
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,160
<i>in the Benetton.</i>

91
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,240
<i>Schumacher is indisputably
pushing Ayrton Senna.</i>

92
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,960
<i>Michael Schumacher comes through
leading the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

93
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,880
<i>Well, is Michael Schumacher
gonna win his first Grand Prix</i>

94
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,240
<i>at the circuit
where he first drove in a Grand Prix?</i>

95
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,480
<i>Twenty-three years old.</i>

96
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,880
<i>The youngest Grand Prix winner
for a long, long time.</i>

97
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,160
<i>It's the first win ever
for Michael Schumacher.</i>

98
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,640
<i>And he puts his arm out.
And he is naturally elated.</i>

99
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
<i>Oh!</i>

100
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
<i>"Yeah! I did it," he says.</i>

101
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,960
I really can't describe it.
I mean, it's something crazy.

102
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
I think the German fans
have waited a long time

103
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,800
for Formula One Grand Prix victory.

104
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,760
And I really give this victory
to the German fans.

105
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,480
Any last words
for anybody back at home?

106
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,960
I think my parents.

107
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,120
I wanna say just hello to them.

108
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,960
It all started with four years.

109
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,560
My father was always interested
in working around, like,

110
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,040
mountain bicycles or little things.

111
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,440
And the... the thing he did was,

112
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:26,760
we had another old moped,
I would say, with 40K's speed.

113
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,200
And he put it on... on this kid go-kart.

114
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,560
And from the beginning on,
I just enjoyed it very much.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,760
I always liked it very much.

116
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,560
I remember when I was six, seven years,
my father started already

117
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,320
to rent out go-karts
for the club at this time.

118
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,320
And I was always with him
to work on the go-karts,

119
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,720
to help him
and as well to test the go-karts.

120
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
When once he finished one go-kart,
I had to test the go-kart if it is okay.

121
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,280
And so, I... I was always together
with him in the go-kart.

122
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,920
We did everything together, and...

123
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
...it was just a... a big pleasure.

124
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,280
<i>When he was just 8 or 9,</i>

125
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,560
<i>he looked after his brother, if necessary.</i>

126
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,360
<i>I could ask him to see
that everything was locked up,</i>

127
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,560
<i>and he would do it.</i>

128
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,840
<i>Michael was always very dependable.</i>

129
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,720
The Schumacher family had a food van,

130
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,120
and then later, they had a restaurant.

131
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,880
Financially,
the Schumacher family was like...

132
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,720
Rolf began his working life
as a bricklayer building chimneys,

133
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,520
but eventually took over
the running of the go-kart track.

134
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,600
And Elisabeth
always had to stay until the end,

135
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,200
until all the guests had left.

136
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,320
My parents had to work very hard

137
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,240
to give us a normal life.

138
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,920
But many rich kids are also poor,
as their parents have no time for them.

139
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,080
We had our parents with us at the track,
which was a big playground.

140
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,520
<i>We always used
the cheapest equipment available.</i>

141
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,320
<i>I fished discarded tires out of the bin,</i>

142
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,680
<i>put them on my go-kart,
and won races with them.</i>

143
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,520
<i>I was always glad to have won
with the worst and not the best equipment.</i>

144
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,280
<i>Having to really fight like that
was an additional motivation for me.</i>

145
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,280
Good afternoon and welcome to Kerpen,

146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,760
to the World Junior Karting Championship.

147
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,520
A total of 18 nations are competing here,
with approximately 80 drivers.

148
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,520
A driver who isn't competing for Germany,
although he is German

149
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,520
and is even the odds-on favorite here,
is Michael Schumacher.

150
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,360
You're competing for Luxembourg. Why?

151
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,760
Because the qualifying races
in Germany cost money.

152
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,280
And if we're eliminated, we don't qualify
for the World Championship.

153
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,200
But in Luxembourg
we're the only competitors,

154
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,040
it doesn't cost anything, and we qualify.

155
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,960
He was already practicing
like a world champion when he was a kid.

156
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,120
He already knew what he wanted
when he was a kid.

157
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,440
<i>He had to do everythin</i> g <i>to get to the top.</i>

158
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,600
<i>And... And I think there was
this hard-boiled professionalism</i>

159
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
<i>from a very, very young age.</i>

160
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,400
<i>Because any small misstep along the way
would have been the end of everything.</i>

161
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,120
1983 in Kerpen-Manheim.

162
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,880
That was actually the...
the first time when we raced together.

163
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,800
It's one of those strong memories

164
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,840
that stayed in my mind
in my racing career.

165
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,720
Of course, it was a circuit,

166
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,000
which was a home circuit for Michael,

167
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,800
so he knew every corner for 100%.

168
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,440
And it was difficult
to race against him on that track.

169
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,320
Looking at the style
that he was driving, it was incredible.

170
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,240
There was a part of the racetrack
in front of the barrack,

171
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,080
where there's a very high-speed chicane,
and it was fascinating to see Michael

172
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,840
coming through that chicane,

173
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,840
having a completely different
driving style than other drivers.

174
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Very controlled.

175
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,760
The driving style was very physical.

176
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,640
The level of mistakes that he did

177
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
through that chicane
every time was very little.

178
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,920
The other drivers, one lap was good,

179
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,520
the second lap again
went a little bit wrong.

180
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,480
But Michael was all the time consistent,
very controlled.

181
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,640
And when I was watching,
I recognized straight away, you know.

182
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,480
This... This guy is... He's good.

183
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,520
We were like 13, 14 years old.

184
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
And...

185
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,560
And full of confidence.

186
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,960
<i>In first place, Michael Schumacher.</i>

187
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,920
<i>He's already won 460 marks today</i>

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,840
<i>and will now receive a further 236 marks!</i>

189
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,680
<i>After those years</i>, <i>I was convinced</i>

190
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,880
<i>I would always be a go-kart driver.</i>

191
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,640
<i>Because I could never have imagined
making it into the Formula class</i>

192
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,040
<i>for financial reasons alone.</i>

193
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,440
In 1988,
a young man kept catching my eye.

194
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,080
His name was Michael Schumacher.

195
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,320
It wasn't the victories.
It was the way he moved the car.

196
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,280
I then asked him to come
and drive for my team.

197
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,520
Of course, money was an issue.

198
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,400
Michael Schumacher
had nothing at that time,

199
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,840
not even 500 marks to finance a season,

200
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,720
which even then cost 600 to 700 thousands.

201
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,920
Willi Weber said to us,
"Come over to my place tonight."

202
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:37,400
"I'm giving him a five-year contract,
a car and 2,000 marks a month salary."

203
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,760
That, of course, was crazy!

204
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,216
<i>If you're involved in motor racing,</i>

205
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,400
<i>I think everyone dreams of competing
in Formula One events one day.</i>

206
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,160
<i>And that's my dream too.</i>

207
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,840
First of all,

208
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,880
I think I'm incredibly fortunate
to have met Michael.

209
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,600
He's simply
the most lovable person I've ever met.

210
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,240
I once made dinner for him
on his birthday.

211
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,800
He was the only one who helped me
to clear up and do the dishes.

212
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,560
And I thought, "That's a proper bloke!"

213
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,320
And yes, he was really funny,
and that's what I saw in him.

214
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,400
I fell in love with him simply
because he was a wonderful person.

215
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,280
I just sensed
that he was something special to me.

216
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,560
I never once thought,

217
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
"He's a terrific racing driver
at the start of a dazzling career."

218
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,640
No one could have guessed
that would happen.

219
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,680
<i>When I started,
I said, "Don't make a star out of me."</i>

220
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,080
<i>"Don't push me too high up.
I don't want this."</i>

221
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,480
<i>What he really didn't like was the press,</i>

222
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,040
<i>the people, all the hype around him.</i>

223
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,880
<i>That's not what he wanted.
He wanted to do the sport.</i>

224
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,880
He was looking for a normal life,

225
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,160
and he had a hard time understanding

226
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,560
why he couldn't have that normal life.

227
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,200
It's true, he could sometimes
seem unsympathetic.

228
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,320
Because there were so many demands on him.

229
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,960
It was often too much and constricted him.

230
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,360
Because he's an extremely
reserved person, shy.

231
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,640
And sometimes that was his way
of dealing with his shyness.

232
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,640
<i>At the time when
Schumacher appeared in Formula One,</i>

233
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,200
<i>Senna was
the preeminent figure in the sport.</i>

234
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,520
<i>Ayrton Senna's third World title ensures</i>

235
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,960
<i>that he'll be ranked
among the all-time greats.</i>

236
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,720
Ayrton had a mystique about him,

237
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,640
but mostly because he was incredibly quick

238
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,880
and incredibly competitive and aggressive,

239
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,880
um, and challenging
towards other competitors.

240
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,440
So, he dominated the sport.

241
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,960
He was the number one.

242
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,120
He was the one that, if you asked somebody
that started in Formula One,

243
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,240
"What do you want to be?"
They'd all say, "Ayrton Senna."

244
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,800
Everyone looked up to him.

245
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,800
If you're suddenly starting

246
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,800
in the same thing, you want to be him.

247
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,320
Here, you've got, uh, at the time

248
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,680
basically an unknown for what he was,

249
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,680
challenging the best.

250
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,720
<i>In the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours,
Schumacher was behind Senna.</i>

251
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,920
<i>And Schumacher challenging
Ayrton Senna in the McLaren.</i>

252
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,760
<i>As they come up to the hairpin,
there is a contact there.</i>

253
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,480
<i>Who is it? It's Schumacher.</i>

254
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,840
<i>And who has he hit? It's Senna.</i>

255
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,440
<i>And now they are sorting their way around.
Are they gonna stop the race?</i>

256
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,000
<i>On the first lap, at the hairpin bend,
Schumacher and Senna seemingly out.</i>

257
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,600
<i>And I am pretty sure
the race will not be stopped.</i>

258
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,400
<i>And I have no doubt,
a very angry Ayrton Senna,</i>

259
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,960
<i>who may well regard</i>

260
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,080
<i>Michael Schumacher's tactics
as being just a bit too rumbustious.</i>

261
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,360
<i>I don't think Michael set out
to try and upset him.</i>

262
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,040
<i>I think Michael was racing
everyone in Formula One</i>

263
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,880
<i>the same way he'd race everyone,
as he should have done.</i>

264
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,320
<i>But it...
it caused some friction.</i>

265
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,160
<i>And, um, Ayrton tried to put Michael
in his place a few times on the track,</i>

266
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,120
<i>which, um, upset Michael.</i>

267
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,520
<i>He didn't think that was...
that was equally respectful.</i>

268
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,240
<i>So... So, they were a bit fractious
in that early period.</i>

269
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,000
Hey, you fucked up, and it's fine.
I came and talked to you.

270
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,520
It's fine. I came and talked to you.

271
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,680
<i>You see, at the time
that Michael really was a super driver,</i>

272
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,880
<i>when he had the fight with Senna,</i>

273
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,160
<i>Senna smelled the guy was somebody.</i>

274
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,960
<i>When you're a lion, all lions will feel it
when the young lion is arriving.</i>

275
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,720
<i>And you want to keep the territory.</i>

276
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,080
'94 was definitely
a growing-up year.

277
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,080
A growing-up year for Michael,
a growing-up year for me.

278
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,000
Nobody could reconcile that our team

279
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,200
had come from almost nowhere
and we're winning races

280
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,760
and mounting a championship challenge.

281
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,120
<i>Michael Schumacher
sliding that car around the circuit.</i>

282
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,760
<i>This is your race leader,
Michael Schumacher.</i>

283
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,760
He'll make the difference on
those dayswhen a winner's in the balance.

284
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,440
<i>Where is Ayrton Senna?
That's the question.</i>

285
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,760
<i>Oh! And Senna spun.
Senna is out of the race.</i>

286
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,240
<i>There he comes.</i>

287
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,560
<i>This can't go wrong.
The checkered flag is out.</i>

288
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,040
<i>Michael Schumacher
wins the Pacific Grand Prix.</i>

289
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,760
<i>And oh boy,</i>

290
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,560
<i>what a season are we gonna have
in Formula One this year.</i>

291
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,720
<i>We were now championship challengers,</i>

292
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,360
<i>and we weren't used to it.
We didn't know how to deal with it.</i>

293
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,040
<i>And when you're beating Ferrari,
and you're beating McLaren,</i>

294
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,640
<i>and you're beating Williams...
These are established teams.</i>

295
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,080
<i>And here was this, uh,
you know, T-shirt manufacturer</i>

296
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,440
<i>coming in with this kid from Germany
and suddenly beating everyone.</i>

297
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,200
So, he won the race in Japan.

298
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,760
We were waiting in the airport.

299
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,480
And Michael was very confident
he was quick enough to beat Ayrton,

300
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
and maybe to win the Championship.

301
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,880
When talking with Michael,
it's like somebody with...

302
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,440
Like he's done this job all life,
you know.

303
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
This was normal. And Senna...

304
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,960
You know,
five years before or four years before,

305
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,600
he had a poster of Senna in the bedroom.

306
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,400
<i>Going into Imola,
Michael was very, very fast,</i>

307
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,680
<i>looking very strong.</i>

308
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,160
<i>And Senna knew that he had to win Imola.</i>

309
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,360
<i>He had to start
to close the gap against Michael.</i>

310
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,200
<i>He had to impose himself on Michael,</i>

311
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,440
<i>because otherwise, Michael was gonna
get away from him in the Championship.</i>

312
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,440
<i>Senna followed by Schumacher.</i>

313
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,640
<i>Schumacher is the chief rival
to Ayrton Senna.</i>

314
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,480
<i>Senna goes through.
Followed by Schumacher.</i>

315
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,640
<i>And into Tamburello.</i>

316
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,840
<i>What on earth happened, I don't know!</i>

317
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,040
<i>Senna is still in the car.</i>

318
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,840
<i>The race has been stopped. Red flag out.</i>

319
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
<i>Well, I say, that's about
190 miles an hour at that point,</i>

320
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
<i>the exit from the Tamburello.</i>

321
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,160
Everybody was silent.

322
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,520
It was a very strange atmosphere,
you know.

323
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,520
<i>Michael Schumacher has, uh, stopped</i>

324
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
<i>and got out of his car.</i>

325
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,080
<i>Helmet off, uh, grim-faced.</i>

326
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,720
<i>Fact is that
what he was doing when he crashed,</i>

327
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,560
<i>when he went off the circuit,</i>

328
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,480
<i>he was trying
to stay ahead of... of Schumacher.</i>

329
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,920
<i>We've seen
many crashes like this,</i>

330
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,720
<i>even crashes that were worse.</i>

331
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,560
<i>Crashes that, they seem
to be worse than-than his crash, and...</i>

332
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,160
<i>and you don't expect anything like this.</i>

333
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,000
<i>You just think,
"Yeah, maybe he has a bruise on the arm</i>

334
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
<i>or maybe he has a broken leg."</i>

335
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,760
<i>Then you go back. They put up the grid.
You don't know what's going on.</i>

336
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,080
<i>Nobody comes to you
and explains the situation.</i>

337
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,960
<i>And we just, you just think that
"Yeah. The race has to go on."</i>

338
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,720
<i>"Everybody's going to race,
so you're going to race."</i>

339
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,880
<i>You don't see why you shouldn't race.</i>

340
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,320
<i>Nobody knew
at that point if Senna was dead.</i>

341
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,240
<i>Had he been declared dead at the circuit,
they'd have had to stop the race.</i>

342
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,280
<i>The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix</i>

343
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,160
<i>has been won by Michael Schumacher.</i>

344
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,160
<i>Before I went to the podium,</i>

345
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,400
<i>I said to Michael,
"No champagne, nothing."</i>

346
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,560
<i>He asked me, "How is Ayrton?"
I told him, "Not in good shape."</i>

347
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,720
<i>That was the first time I saw Michael
as a different guy.</i>

348
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,800
We went up to the podium.

349
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,640
He told us,
"Yeah, he, uh, he's in a coma."

350
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,240
But a coma can be many things.

351
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,000
It can just be something
that is going to be okay the next day

352
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,520
or very bad. But you don't judge it.

353
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,800
And because you still don't believe
that there is something

354
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,360
particular or very dangerous
or very heavy, you don't believe it.

355
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,080
And I... I still...

356
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,440
I... I think it was two hours after the race

357
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,960
when Mr. Walkinshaw came up to me
and said, "It's looking very bad."

358
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,360
And I thought, "No! He's in a coma,
but coma doesn't mean anything bad."

359
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,080
He said, "No, it looks not too good."

360
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,920
Uh...

361
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,360
And then somebody
came to me later and said, "He's dead."

362
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,200
And one minute later, uh,
the next one came to me and said,

363
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,000
"No, he's in a coma."

364
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,880
But there was
so little information at this time

365
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,160
that you didn't know what you...
what you should think about this.

366
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,920
And I still... I still didn't believe
that he's gonna be dead.

367
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,440
I... I just couldn't...
couldn't think of that at that point.

368
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,520
I just thought,
"Yeah, no, he's going to be the champion."

369
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,800
"He maybe misses one or two races,
and then he's coming back again."

370
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,640
But the worst... the worst was really
the two weeks after this.

371
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,320
I mean, once I really had to accept
that it is, that he is dead.

372
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,000
I mean, this... this was...

373
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,520
just something crazy.

374
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Yeah.

375
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,640
<i>With Senna gone,
Michael Schumacher was now</i>

376
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,560
<i>the number one figure in the sport.</i>

377
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,360
<i>Although he hadn't yet won
a World Championship.</i>

378
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,560
<i>Was it is easy to...
to drive again?</i>

379
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,120
I mean, in Silverstone, I went there...

380
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,360
and you suddenly saw
many things with different eyes.

381
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,440
I went around with a road car
in Silverstone through the circuit,

382
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,320
and I just thought,
"This is a point you could be dead."

383
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,040
"This is a point you could be dead."

384
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,840
I thought, "Crazy, you always tested here,
you always raced here."

385
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,400
"But there are many points you can crash
and you can be immediately dead."

386
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,520
That's the only thing I was thinking of.

387
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,040
And I didn't know
what's gonna be the situation

388
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,840
if I'm going to be in a race car.

389
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,560
I wasn't sure.
Can I drive without thinking that,

390
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,400
or I am going to drive now,
always thinking, "You can be dead here."

391
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,840
"If you go off here,
it's going to be bad and..."

392
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,760
That was... something very strange.

393
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,200
I wake up during the night,

394
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,680
and I, like,

395
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,120
sleep maybe three hours a night
and stuff like this.

396
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,400
We were totally shocked.

397
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,800
We asked ourselves
how it could have happened.

398
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,840
And Michael really asked himself
if everyone was acting correctly.

399
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,880
It was really, really...

400
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,680
really difficult.

401
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,520
It was a real struggle for him,

402
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,200
but he was a master
at blocking things out.

403
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,240
He was able to focus so intently
on whatever he was doing

404
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,160
that he blocked out everything else.

405
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,040
So I think that mentally he's very strong.

406
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,640
It's something he just has.

407
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,320
Extremely strong.

408
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,200
He still shows me
every day just how strong he actually is.

409
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,360
<i>Damon Hill was now
leading the Williams team.</i>

410
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,920
<i>And he gave Michael a fight.</i>

411
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,720
<i>Damon Hill wins
the British Grand Prix.</i>

412
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,520
<i>Magnificent!</i>

413
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,760
<i>Damon Hill wins the Italian Grand Prix.</i>

414
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,480
<i>He won here last year.
It was the end of a hat trick...</i>

415
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,600
<i>It was a complex, turbulent,</i>

416
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,280
<i>human whirlwind of a season.</i>

417
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,920
<i>Michael Schumacher wins
the European Grand Prix here at Jerez.</i>

418
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,800
<i>Michael Schumacher
has opened up the gap again.</i>

419
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,080
<i>And it was
an intensely human drama.</i>

420
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,280
<i>The races would swing like a pendulum
between Damon and Michael.</i>

421
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,160
<i>Damon Hill wins!</i>

422
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,600
<i>Hill has got
the biggest challenge in his life</i>

423
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,160
<i>to go head-to-head
with Michael Schumacher.</i>

424
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,800
<i>The point is,
that you know his is the decisive race</i>

425
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,080
<i>and all tactics, the overtaking maneuvers,</i>

426
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,840
<i>the situation will be based on that.</i>

427
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,360
<i>One point
between Schumacher and Hill.</i>

428
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,160
So the Championship went down
to this incredibly thrilling last race.

429
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,920
Realistically, it didn't look like
it was gonna be that easy.

430
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,320
So, there I was.

431
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,840
Suddenly in a title fight
with, uh, Michael Schumacher.

432
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,240
<i>The red light is on
here in Adelaide.</i>

433
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,760
<i>And we are racing
for the last time in this season.</i>

434
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,960
<i>And Michael Schumacher takes the lead!</i>

435
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,360
<i>Schumacher takes the lead.
Or is it Damon Hill?</i>

436
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,640
<i>It's Schumacher who leads from Hill.</i>

437
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,200
<i>I had to fight very hard
with the car.</i>

438
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,000
<i>It was very difficult for me</i>

439
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,240
<i>to keep the car
on the road the whole time.</i>

440
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,080
<i>And as well, I...
I couldn't go away from Damon.</i>

441
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,320
We were just nose to tail
for about 20 laps or so.

442
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,000
Michael had just started to pull away,
and I was starting to think,

443
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,040
"I can't... I can't keep up that pace."

444
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,280
<i>I had a time
where I suddenly, uh, found a line</i>

445
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
<i>where I could disappear a little bit,</i>

446
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>for I think two seconds,
two-and-a-half seconds.</i>

447
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,760
<i>I was all the time on the limit,
really fighting very hard.</i>

448
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,880
<i>And then, on the bump,
I just, uh, stepped out.</i>

449
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,080
<i>Then, I painted the wall.</i>

450
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,720
<i>I was already disappointed.
I thought, "Shit,"</i>

451
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,280
<i>but then I felt,
"Okay, you... you still can go on."</i>

452
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,880
When we went around one of the corners,
I saw him coming back on the track,

453
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,080
and it looked like he'd just gone off
and then came back on again.

454
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,880
And I saw his car wobbling.

455
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,000
When I drove over to the left,
I was doing a bit like this

456
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,960
to check everything, clean off the tires.

457
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,640
I saw an opportunity to go past,
and I felt, "I have to go."

458
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,760
<i>Look at Damon Hill
and Schumacher. Oh no!</i>

459
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,600
The moment I turned into the corner,

460
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,880
it was Damon
who hit me first on the sidepod.

461
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,720
And his car came back across
and hit my car,

462
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,080
and he went up on two wheels.

463
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
In a moment, I was up in the air
and then into the tire walls.

464
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,560
So no, I... I couldn't understand it.

465
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,600
<i>Oh! Out goes Schumacher!</i>

466
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,240
<i>The German is out
of the Australian Grand Prix</i>,

467
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,280
<i>and Damon Hill only has to keep going
to be World Champion.</i>

468
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,200
The point situation was very simple.

469
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,560
He had a points' advantage on me.

470
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,200
If none of us finished, he'd be Champion.

471
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,000
<i>Damon Hill will have
to go back to the pits.</i>

472
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,800
I could see
my suspension was broken.

473
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,800
So, I couldn't carry on.

474
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,760
As a competitor, he was going
to win come what may.

475
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,080
Michael did what he had to do
to stop me beating him.

476
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,680
Put me in the car,

477
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
um,

478
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,560
in Adelaide,
and I've got a points' advantage,

479
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,760
and my rival comes up the inside,
what would I do?

480
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,480
I don't know.

481
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,680
<i>The 1994 World Championship</i>

482
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,280
<i>has been won by Michael Schumacher.</i>

483
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,320
Oh!

484
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,160
Whoo! Whoo!

485
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,080
<i>Corinna has given me great support,</i>

486
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,520
<i>and she certainly is doing so now.</i>

487
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,200
<i>That's why Corinna wanted to come,
and I wanted her to come too.</i>

488
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,840
<i>And it looks like
she's brought me luck again.</i>

489
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Actually, I always went with him

490
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,640
throughout those years.

491
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,000
It might have been in the bus
or somewhere behind the scenes,

492
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,080
but I was always on the road with him.

493
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,440
We always enjoyed it together.

494
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,800
It was a support to him,

495
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,720
just knowing he wasn't alone.

496
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,120
Because we were traveling
around the world, changing time zones,

497
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,520
we really did make sure
that he slept well.

498
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,720
And Michael planned practically
everything down to the minute.

499
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,160
Get up at such-and-such a time,
15 to 20 minutes in the bathroom.

500
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,720
One night, when we were in Suzuka,
I realized there was no way

501
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,760
I was going to fall asleep,

502
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,960
so I spent half the night
sitting on the toilet,

503
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,560
in order not to wake him up,
to let him have a good night's sleep.

504
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,160
So I read my book in there.

505
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,960
On the other hand, when we were at home

506
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,320
and Michael had to leave early,

507
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,200
I never heard him.

508
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
He was so quiet.

509
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,040
He always came to my bed
just before he left,

510
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:37,320
stroked my arm, gave me a kiss,
and said, "I'm leaving."

511
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,360
And he was gone. He never woke me.

512
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,640
He was always very considerate towards me.

513
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,120
<i>The crowd is roaring.
The flags are waving.</i>

514
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,200
<i>To greet home their idol
and their hero, Michael Schumacher.</i>

515
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,160
<i>And he wins the German Grand Prix.</i>

516
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,040
<i>There is the hero.</i>

517
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,640
<i>And there are the people
who admire and venerate him.</i>

518
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,640
<i>There are over 100,000 Germans here.</i>

519
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,680
<i>This is what
they have waited for for so long,</i>

520
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,040
<i>to see a German win the German Grand Prix.</i>

521
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,920
<i>Michael Schumacher enters
the last corner of the last race</i>

522
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,880
<i>of the last lap
to win the Pacific Grand Prix in Japan</i>

523
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,280
<i>and to become the World Champion of 1995</i>

524
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,120
<i>as he was the World Champion of 1994.</i>

525
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,440
<i>And, uh, no further proof is needed</i>

526
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,240
<i>that he is the best driver of his day.</i>

527
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,200
<i>I don't think Michael ever wanted
to keep increasing the numbers</i>

528
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,840
<i>of World Championships.</i>

529
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,120
<i>If he'd stayed at Benetton,
I think he'd have won</i>

530
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,000
<i>the World Championship in '96 as well.</i>

531
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,960
<i>But that didn't motivate him anymore.</i>

532
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,320
When you're in the car,
you are controlling your own destiny.

533
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
Yeah.

534
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,360
You only get one chance.

535
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,120
In Formula One,
everyone is very discrete.

536
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,920
No one would approach
a driver in the pit and say,

537
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,040
"Can we talk?" Never.

538
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,200
He received a number of offers.

539
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,400
He could stay where he was.

540
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,960
At McLaren, he could drive
one of their cars with a Mercedes motor.

541
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,400
And he could come to Ferrari.

542
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,160
At that time,

543
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,760
Niki Lauda was working
for Ferrari as a consultant.

544
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,880
The situation at Ferrari
was anything but good.

545
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,240
Niki Lauda approached me and said,

546
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:18,200
"At McLaren, he'd just be one of many
who get in a car and win races."

547
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:24,040
"At Ferrari, he'd be an exceptional driver
who, after their fallow years,

548
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,200
would win races with this Ferrari."

549
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,840
And that appealed to his fighting spirit,

550
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,200
which he'd developed as a go-kart driver.

551
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,080
He'd won with used karts and tires,

552
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,400
so why shouldn't he do that at Ferrari?

553
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,600
My last piece of advice was,

554
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,840
"If you become
World Champion in a Ferrari,

555
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,080
you can throw away your passport."

556
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,760
Schumacher!

557
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,920
Ferrari is the oldest team.

558
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:35,680
And in Italy, Ferrari is like a religion.

559
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,000
So, there's an expectation.
There's a passion for Ferrari in Italy.

560
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:51,160
<i>Expectations on any driver
who goes to race for Ferrari are enormous.</i>

561
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,760
<i>The Ferrari President said, you know,</i>

562
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,960
<i>"Well, last year we had
two very good drivers,</i>

563
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,480
<i>but this year we have a star."</i>

564
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,240
Drive a Ferrari
means to have a lot of pressure.

565
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,920
Drive a Ferrari means
that if you don't win, you are an idiot.

566
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,320
Drive a Ferrari means
to have also responsibility

567
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,200
because you drive
not a normal Formula One car,

568
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,760
but you drive a legend.

569
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,720
You drive something unique.

570
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,680
We joined Ferrari at the same time, '96.

571
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,920
I remember when I sat in the car,
I said, "It looks worryingly different

572
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,280
to everything else."

573
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,680
And, unfortunately,

574
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,120
I was proved correct.

575
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,520
That car was a disaster.

576
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,360
So, for quite a while,
we really didn't understand

577
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,080
how bad the car was.

578
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,080
And, as it turned out,
it was pretty unfixable, really.

579
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,560
The basic philosophy of the car was wrong.

580
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,680
<i>Here this morning,
Damon Hill clouted Frentzen.</i>

581
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,920
<i>And that's a problem
for Schumacher already.</i>

582
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,320
<i>Looks like Schumacher's engine is gone</i>
o <i>n the warm-up lap.</i>

583
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,680
<i>Now, that is incredible!</i>

584
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,440
<i>And he has, before the race begins,
wrecked. Schumacher is out of it.</i>

585
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,960
<i>At the French Grand Prix in Magny-Cours,
he didn't make the start.</i>

586
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,120
<i>It was... It was a lame duck of a car.</i>

587
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,360
<i>And Michael was... was in the car
on the back of a tow truck.</i>

588
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,400
<i>It was like a symbol of impotence.</i>

589
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,680
I'm not sure
whether we're going to solve

590
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,160
all these problems, uh,
in a couple of months.

591
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,280
I... I don't see the... the point.

592
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,280
We... We are in a position really
to win the Championship.

593
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,400
It must... must be a lot of luck,
and, uh, and maybe a dream.

594
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,080
But because I'm not a dreamer,
I am a realistic person, uh,

595
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,200
I think it's... it's true what I'm saying.

596
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,640
<i>In that first season, I remember,
on the Friday night before the race,</i>

597
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,440
<i>everybody had gone,
all the drivers had gone,</i>

598
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,960
<i>the team personnel had gone.</i>

599
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,880
<i>But in the Ferrari garage,</i>

600
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,040
<i>there was a car being worked on.
It was Michael's car.</i>

601
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,720
<i>There were three mechanics and Michael.</i>

602
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,960
<i>And Michael was talking quietly
to the mechanics.</i>

603
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,160
<i>I got such a strong impression
of how hard Michael was willing to work,</i>

604
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:43,560
<i>how he would be the last one
in the garage every night, with mechanics.</i>

605
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,880
<i>You know, he wouldn't leave early
to go off and do something else.</i>

606
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,200
<i>He would be there, with them,</i>

607
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,520
<i>working with them,
making them feel his presence.</i>

608
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,720
<i>Making them feel he cared
about their work on the cars.</i>

609
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,000
<i>And that transformed the team.</i>

610
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,840
Michael was always
one of the last to leave.

611
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,320
In the years with Ferrari,
he would be in meetings till ten at night.

612
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,120
We never went out for a nice dinner
at a restaurant.

613
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,920
No. We sat in this tent the whole time.

614
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,520
I waited, we ate pasta,

615
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,040
we talked,

616
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,760
then he was gone again,
another meeting, then he came back.

617
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:34,520
But I was thankful
for every minute we could spend together.

618
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,120
<i>Michael is super professional.</i>

619
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,840
<i>He just said,
"Listen, we gotta work through this."</i>

620
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,760
<i>And he worked very, very hard.</i>

621
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,320
<i>The great thing about Michael
being in the team</i>

622
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,840
<i>was everybody knew there was nobody
who could drive like he could drive.</i>

623
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,840
<i>During the night,
the rain absolutely hammered down.</i>

624
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,200
<i>It has continued to do so all day.</i>

625
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,760
<i>The prospects are for a totally wet race.</i>

626
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,240
<i>And there is the Ferrari
of Michael Schumacher.</i>

627
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,520
<i>He's got past Gerhard Berger.
He's up into third place.</i>

628
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,320
<i>And he's right behind Villeneuve and Alesi</i>

629
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,040
<i>and will soon be challenging for the lead.</i>

630
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,776
If you got a terrible car,
it's still terrible in the rain.

631
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,200
You can't overcome that.

632
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,320
In Barcelona,
he managed to find a way of driving and...

633
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,880
and coping and, uh,
and adapting his style.

634
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,720
I don't think there were
many drivers who could do that.

635
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,880
He just disappeared,
and no one was anywhere near him.

636
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,880
<i>The genius of Michael Schumacher</i>

637
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,680
<i>is making up
for the deficiencies of the Ferrari.</i>

638
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,560
<i>This is classic racing
in appalling conditions.</i>

639
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,800
You know,
he always loved the rain.

640
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,160
You can jump to a different level.

641
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,920
And I think those are the circumstances

642
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,280
which demonstrate
the true geniuses in the sport.

643
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,240
As kids,
we only drove on slicks in the rain.

644
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,440
We went to the go-kart track
whenever we could.

645
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:27,120
This allows you to develop
incredible control over the car.

646
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,080
You gain confidence in it
and become one with it.

647
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,880
And then you can perform
these otherwise impossible miracles.

648
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,600
<i>It is gonna be an historic win</i>

649
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,600
<i>for Schumacher, for Ferrari.</i>

650
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,200
<i>The last corner!</i>

651
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,880
<i>And Michael Schumacher wins
the Spanish Grand Prix</i>

652
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,480
<i>after an absolutely superlative drive.</i>

653
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,080
To win races in that car
was the greatest achievements,

654
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,840
I would say, of any driver.

655
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,320
It's... It's... It's beyond credibility
how that happened.

656
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,200
I have no idea how can he can do that.

657
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,920
<i>The challenge of taking Ferrari
back to World Championship level</i>

658
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,200
<i>is a challenge
that Michael couldn't resist.</i>

659
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,760
<i>I talked to him about it
quite extensively, actually.</i>

660
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,480
<i>And he just felt
that the right thing to do</i>

661
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,560
<i>was to take on that challenge
and make Ferrari great again.</i>

662
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,160
<i>Give them back the title
that Ferrari had been wanting since 1979.</i>

663
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,480
<i>He wanted to do something that,
you know, hadn't been done by Prost,</i>

664
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,520
<i>hadn't been done by Senna,
hadn't been done by any of the drivers</i>

665
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,760
<i>in... in recent history.</i>

666
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,480
<i>That was a real challenge.</i>

667
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,200
<i>1997. There was a feeling now, going into
the second year with Michael at Ferrari,</i>

668
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,680
<i>that they should be challenging
for the Championship.</i>

669
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,160
<i>In a way, the momentum was with him.</i>

670
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,880
<i>The Tifosi's expectations were very high.</i>

671
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,440
<i>We knew we were gonna have a real showdown
between Villeneuve and Schumacher.</i>

672
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,880
I hope it'll be a real duel
between us on the track,

673
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,520
and that neither teammates

674
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,440
nor lapped drivers
nor any other drivers intervene.

675
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
<i>What do you think
will be the key to victory here?</i>

676
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,760
Well, first of all, not being taken off.

677
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,880
That will be very important.

678
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,880
And then just being fast,
being quicker than Michael. That's all.

679
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,880
<i>And it's go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Villeneuve gets away,</i>

680
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,720
<i>and Schumacher gets away
better, better, better!</i>

681
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:21,440
<i>Michael Schumacher leads
and up alongside Villeneuve.</i>

682
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,400
<i>We knew that Jacques had a quicker car.</i>

683
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,640
<i>It was just a question of whether or not
he and the team would be able</i>

684
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,040
<i>to use strategy and speed
to get the better of Michael.</i>

685
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,920
<i>And the gap
between Michael Schumacher</i>

686
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,400
<i>and Jacques Villeneuve
is down to just over one second.</i>

687
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,320
<i>Some kind of gearshift problem,
because Villeneuve is all over him, look!</i>

688
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,360
<i>He's through! Oh yes!</i>

689
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,960
<i>In his mind,
Jacques Villeneuve had hit him.</i>

690
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,600
<i>He wasn't putting on an act.</i>

691
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,480
<i>In his head, that's what happened.</i>

692
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,160
<i>So, in that fraction of a second,
what happened with him?</i>

693
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,960
<i>Who knows? It... It wasn't a conscious...</i>

694
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,000
<i>It wasn't a premeditated act.</i>

695
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,640
<i>It was something which happened,
and he came back and was convinced.</i>

696
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,960
<i>And he wasn't trying to convince others
that he'd not done wrong.</i>

697
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,536
For Michael,
it was, in a psychological point of view,

698
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,080
a very difficult moment.

699
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,640
He was in the lead. Ten laps to go,

700
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,400
to win, in 1997, the Championship
in the second season with Ferrari.

701
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,720
Michael came back to the pits,

702
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,040
convinced that Jacques had hit him.

703
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,120
And then, when we showed him the video,
he realized that that wasn't the case.

704
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:44,520
Um, that... that he had driven
into Jacques Villeneuve.

705
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,520
And it was one of those moments

706
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:51,000
that Michael had two or three times
in his career, where his commitment,

707
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,360
his competitiveness, his dedication,

708
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,640
just went that one step too far.

709
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,400
It's a very difficult thing
for us to judge,

710
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,960
but I think
he overstepped the mark that day.

711
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,280
Often,
he overstepped the mark

712
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,880
when he really didn't need to.

713
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:17,880
When he had done enough,
whether it was qualifying, he had pole,

714
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,760
whether it was a race victory
which he had in the back,

715
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,280
whether it was a one-on-one,
a battle with somebody.

716
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,840
You know, at times,
did he have always to believe in himself?

717
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,080
That he was doing the right things?
Because there was this paranoid perfection

718
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,960
that he needed always
to do more to prove more to himself.

719
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,320
Because ultimately, a lot of the time,
he was racing himself.

720
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,560
He was battling with himself.

721
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,480
That, "Have I done enough today?
Do I want to do more?"

722
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,480
"How am I gonna destroy the opposition?"

723
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,560
"What do I need to do..."

724
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,360
"...to continue to be the main man?"

725
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,640
SCHUMI, THAT'S INSANE!

726
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,960
VILLENEUVE REAL CHAMPION

727
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,080
"I'M NOT TO BLAME, I'D DO IT AGAIN"

728
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,600
SCHUMI LOSES HIS SMILE

729
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,760
I think people that are
and want to be in control

730
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,760
don´t want to accept the fact,

731
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,240
"Maybe I did it wrong."

732
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,680
So, that wasn't his character.

733
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,560
Michael is a Capricorn.

734
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,520
He was born under the sign of Capricorn.

735
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,320
And a Capricorn never apologizes,

736
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,120
can't apologize, and never makes mistakes.

737
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,520
The word "mistake" doesn't exist
for a Capricorn. He never makes any.

738
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,720
- Morning from London, Michael.
- How are you feeling, Michael?

739
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:59,040
All the races before,
I've been put onto the sky from the press,

740
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,680
and suddenly after that weekend,

741
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,160
I have been put
into the ground from the press.

742
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,600
Obviously, uh,

743
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,240
I'm as much a human being as... as anyone.

744
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,040
And things can happen to me
as they can happen to anyone else.

745
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:19,160
And it happened to me,
which I didn't want to admit at the time.

746
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,920
But now I have no chance than to admit,
and I understand what I did.

747
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,800
<i>The governing body had a look at it
and basically disqualified him</i>

748
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,680
<i>from the '97 Championship.</i>

749
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,560
<i>It is quite a big deal,
which has never happened before</i>

750
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,640
<i>in this sport.</i>

751
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,440
Michael, any comment?

752
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,520
We stayed in the chalet.

753
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:12,480
We played a lot of games
because he wanted to unwind a bit.

754
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,600
It was a wonderful time with many friends.

755
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,400
Sometimes there were 30 of us there,
and we really had a lot of fun.

756
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,080
We took everybody with us.
Grandma, Grandpa, Auntie.

757
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,000
The whole plane was full.
We really enjoyed it.

758
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,440
He really enjoyed going there.
We were there for six weeks.

759
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,320
And we didn't talk much about Formula One

760
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,680
or anything relating to his work.

761
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,240
We just had fun.

762
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,080
Michael exercised a little,
but not that much during that time.

763
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,440
When the testing started again, he said,

764
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,520
"I'm curious to see if I'm still
fast enough, if I can still do it."

765
01:03:54,120 --> 01:04:00,080
Michael always had self-doubts
in that respect. "Can I still do it?"

766
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,320
It was very important to Michael

767
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,320
that nobody in the team ever noticed

768
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,600
when he was really struggling,
gritting his teeth,

769
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,040
maybe even having doubts
or feeling desperate.

770
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,920
He was extremely good at hiding that.

771
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Because outwardly,
when he went to the garage

772
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:38,720
or anywhere he could be seen,
he was energetic and dynamic.

773
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,000
<i>He had realized very, very early on</i>

774
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,480
<i>in his racing career</i>

775
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,560
<i>that you only get out what you put in.</i>

776
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,320
<i>And that became his mantra.</i>

777
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,760
<i>It had to be absolute all-out commitment.</i>

778
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,960
<i>It is like a war.</i>

779
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,360
<i>If you don't go all in,
then you're not going to come out on top.</i>

780
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,120
<i>And that is the philosophy
of Michael Schumacher.</i>

781
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,920
In the car,
everything had to be perfect.

782
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,480
He always paid close attention to detail

783
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,000
and demanded that we do exactly the same.

784
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:22,640
And with people, too,
he had an incredible eye for detail.

785
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,200
He always had a smile, a "Thank you,"
and a "Please" for everyone,

786
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,680
even at times of great tension.

787
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,520
This was the attention to detail
that he dedicated to each of us.

788
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,800
To him, the car was important,
the team was important, with everyone.

789
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,760
There were days
when Michael would make the difference.

790
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,240
You know, a driver can be so influential
in those things, motivating the team.

791
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,720
Michael knew all the staff.

792
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:56,040
He knew their names
and sometimes knew their wives' names.

793
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,880
He would play football with them.
You know, he was a great motivator.

794
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,920
And people would do an enormous amount

795
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,760
to support Michael
and... and try and make him successful.

796
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,920
If you can fill everyone with enthusiasm,

797
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,120
then they'll do everything for you
and enjoy doing it.

798
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,000
I think that's the key.

799
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:22,680
Even the guy who cooked their pasta
was happy when he came

800
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,720
because he always thanked him and said,
"Your pasta is the best!"

801
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,440
He said, "<i>Pasta aglio e olio!</i> That's it!"

802
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,680
He loved it.

803
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,920
Even the cook was
a totally integral part of the team.

804
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,160
It was a big family
that made us feel secure.

805
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,960
<i>I think my mechanics, my engineers,</i>

806
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,880
<i>they know now what to think about me.</i>

807
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,080
<i>They trust 100% myself. I trust 100% them.</i>

808
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,640
<i>Every time I'm on the...
on the circuit the whole day,</i>

809
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,600
<i>I think about what I can change</i>

810
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:05,120
<i>on the car to make it quicker.</i>

811
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,240
<i>They were spraying
their track to test the wet tires.</i>

812
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,680
<i>They were testing the intermediate tires.
They were trying different things</i>

813
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,400
<i>if they wanted to stay on
until it was almost dark.</i>

814
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,680
<i>The amount of hours that he put in</i>

815
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,040
<i>on developing the car
and testing outside of the public view</i>

816
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,840
<i>of the Grand Prix is incredible.</i>

817
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,201
We'd start testing
at eight in the morning,

818
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:11,600
sometimes we'd finish
at like eight o'clock at night.

819
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,000
He demanded a lot from himself.

820
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,040
He was just on such a limit

821
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,000
to try and get the results
in cars that weren't

822
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,000
as good as the opposition's.

823
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:36,920
McLaren was just
fundamentally so much better

824
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,040
that there was no way
we were gonna catch up.

825
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:44,520
That really got to him, you know?

826
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,960
As it would anybody.

827
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,560
<i>Schumacher, who'd been developing
the Ferrari with the team,</i>

828
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,000
<i>you know,
making it more and more competitive,</i>

829
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,280
<i>discovered that he had a new rival.</i>

830
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,960
<i>The latest Flying Finn, Mika Häkkinen.</i>

831
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:15,880
<i>Right from the first test</i>

832
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:19,760
<i>Mika Häkkinen knew that he had
a monstrous weapon in his hands.</i>

833
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,400
<i>The McLaren was a rocket ship that year.</i>

834
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,320
<i>And Ferrari had to fight really hard</i>

835
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,880
<i>to develop their car to be able to match.</i>

836
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:32,400
<i>Mika Häkkinen leading.
Where is Michael Schumacher?</i>

837
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,120
<i>...a tremendous flume of spray.</i>

838
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,440
<i>Mika Häkkinen, of course,
has got a clear track in front of him...</i>

839
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,560
<i>Mika Häkkinen is gonna give him
a hard time right from the beginning.</i>

840
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,360
<i>The pendulum swung between Häkkinen
and Schumacher throughout the year.</i>

841
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,320
<i>Häkkinen made a few mistakes.
Schumacher had some... some brilliant races.</i>

842
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,600
<i>And he was in contention
for that World Championship.</i>

843
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,120
Michael was definitely on edge.

844
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:21,240
His approach of winning
was that there was no fear.

845
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,560
There was no thinking that

846
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,120
"I can get hurt
or somebody else can get hurt."

847
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,440
I did go to speak to Michael.

848
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,040
I said, "Look, you know, man,
you cannot do this."

849
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,680
"You cannot do this
when we go such a high speed,

850
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,560
300 kilometers per hour,
and I come so much quicker."

851
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,000
"You cannot block me."

852
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,200
And he was just
lifting his shoulders basically

853
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,960
and said, "Mika, this is racing."

854
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:53,000
Final move, you move again.

855
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,080
- Before you come in...
- Yeah. Yeah.

856
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,880
We had great fun and respect
for somebody's success.

857
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,440
And vice versa. We have our own life.

858
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,240
Uh, and in a racetrack,
we were competitors.

859
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,880
So, it's difficult to be a friend.

860
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,560
I think there...
there's the two sides, isn't there?

861
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,360
There's Michael, the racing driver,

862
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:20,400
uncompromising, fast,
you know, determined, um, hard racer.

863
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,720
And then there's, of course,
Michael the private man, the family man.

864
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,720
Um, you know,
I've had many social evenings with him...

865
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,920
...drinking Bacardi-Coke,

866
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,920
and he'd have a cigar,
and he was a completely different person.

867
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,600
Because, of course, at that point,
there's no competition.

868
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,360
It's just sharing... sharing
a nice social moment together.

869
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,560
At parties, he was
the first to arrive and the last to leave.

870
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,800
He loved it.

871
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,880
We laughed so much, had so much real fun.

872
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,920
And the kids still remember that,
that it was always fun.

873
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,360
Michael loved
throwing people into the pool.

874
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,840
We all ended up in the pool every time.

875
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:08,000
That was Michael's thing.

876
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:11,480
Even at our wedding,
people were thrown into the pool.

877
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,800
He couldn't sing well.

878
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,760
It was one of the things
he didn't do so well.

879
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:22,200
But he always sang "My Way"
because he knew the lyrics.

880
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,480
Really funny.

881
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:31,840
Oh my God!

882
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,680
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

883
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,760
There were many times
where he was just on his own.

884
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,400
No one was close to him.

885
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,960
I think it was pretty difficult
to get to know Michael.

886
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,720
A difficult guy to really, uh...

887
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,960
He was... There was a...
There was... There was still a fence there.

888
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,720
Michael is very suspicious.

889
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,200
He always has been,
during the initial period.

890
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:12,600
Until he thinks he knows someone
or can trust them,

891
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,520
then he opens up completely.

892
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:18,160
That wasn't only the case with me,
in the beginning,

893
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,440
but also with other friends.

894
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:25,880
But he's always been
a very suspicious person.

895
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,000
I have to say that.

896
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:33,160
But if he opens up, then 100%.
Really all the way.

897
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,680
<i>Drivers' Championship,</i>

898
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,320
<i>Mika Häkkinen leading the way
by seven points from Michael Schumacher.</i>

899
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,440
<i>Alongside him on the front row,</i>

900
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,600
<i>his teammate, David Coulthard,</i>

901
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:52,200
<i>making it an all McLaren front row.</i>

902
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,720
<i>Mika Häkkinen starting in pole position</i>

903
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:04,360
<i>for the ninth time
in thirteen races this year. Five lights.</i>

904
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,640
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

905
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,560
<i>Häkkinen leads away again.</i>

906
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,280
<i>Irvine again comes up left.</i>

907
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,960
<i>Damon Hill has made
an excellent start and leads! And leads!</i>

908
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,880
<i>Damon Hill gets ahead
of everybody at La Source.</i>

909
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,800
<i>Schumacher going round the outside,
and he is hitting Häkkinen.</i>

910
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,400
<i>Schumacher hit Häkkinen.</i>

911
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,320
<i>Since Häkkinen
was already out early in the race,</i>

912
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,360
<i>you know, this was an opportunity
for Schumacher to take advantage,</i>

913
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,200
<i>to take the ten points
while Häkkinen wasn't going to score any.</i>

914
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,000
<i>And that would be key
in what was obviously going to be</i>

915
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,040
<i>a long and tight battle for the title.</i>

916
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,520
<i>If Michael Schumacher
can stay where he is now</i>

917
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,520
<i>he will be taking the lead
in the World Championship by three points.</i>

918
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,880
<i>The track is covered in water.</i>

919
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,560
<i>The tires, huge tires,
are throwing up spray,</i>

920
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,400
<i>throwing up water.
And if you're following,</i>

921
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,040
<i>you can't see the other car.
You can't see the sides of the road.</i>

922
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,440
<i>You can't see anything.</i>

923
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,880
Michael was winning
by a long margin.

924
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,960
The team told me,
"The leader's coming up to... to lap you."

925
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,000
But of course,
in the rain, you can't really see.

926
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,840
You have little mirrors,
but with the spray, you can't judge

927
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,440
where the... the other car is.

928
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,400
So, I was waiting, waiting for him

929
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,560
to overtake
as we went down to Blanchimont,

930
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,080
which is a fast left-hander.

931
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,000
<i>Now let us not forget
Coulthard in these appalling conditions...</i>

932
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:57,080
<i>Oh God! Michael Schumacher
hits David Coulthard</i>

933
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,120
<i>and is out of the Belgian Grand Prix!</i>

934
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,520
<i>Maybe he should have been
a bit more circumspect</i>

935
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,280
<i>about trying to pass him!</i>

936
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,960
Michael was definitely the,
let's say, the passenger in that accident.

937
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,560
And the first part of the track
would have been very easy for Coulthard

938
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,720
to pull over and let Michael through and...

939
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,320
But he didn't.
He stayed and made it difficult.

940
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,440
I think David came off the throttle.

941
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,760
You know, you never do that in the wet,

942
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,960
where drivers can't see what's going on.

943
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,280
You don't take your foot off the throttle.
And Michael hit him.

944
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,720
<i>...in the World Championship leads.
Now, what is he up to?</i>

945
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,360
<i>He's storming down the pit lane,
presumably to... Look at him! Look at him!</i>

946
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,600
<i>He is saying,
"I am going to the stewards."</i>

947
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,000
<i>He is going to Coulthard.</i>

948
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,440
<i>He is going to have it out
with David Coulthard.</i>

949
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:51,720
I knew he was angry.

950
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,480
You know, his,
his neck was... was red.

951
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,080
And his eyes were out on stalks.
And obviously, the team kept us apart.

952
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,000
Do you want to fucking kill me?

953
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,120
We met up in Ecclestone's bus
to try and clear the air.

954
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,560
I said to him, "You know,
I accept my part in the crash,

955
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,880
but you need to take
some responsibility as well."

956
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,000
And he went,
"No, I don't see it like that."

957
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:27,440
I said, "But Michael, in fairness,
you crashed into the back of me!"

958
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,760
"I didn't reverse into you."

959
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,520
And it led
to a conversation where I said,

960
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,920
"Surely, you must be wrong sometimes."

961
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,920
And he thought about it for a while,
and he went, "Not that I remember."

962
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,600
The expectation
and the disappointment kept growing.

963
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,800
Because in people's minds it was,

964
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,960
"Michael has arrived,
so Ferrari will win immediately."

965
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,880
So, he arrives in '96,

966
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,120
then '97, '98, '99.

967
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:17,200
And at some point, one wonders
if Michael is the driver for us

968
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,640
or should we have someone like Häkkinen?

969
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,080
<i>Mika Häkkinen
is on magnificent form here.</i>

970
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,040
<i>We've had
the qualifying session this morning,</i>

971
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,400
<i>and Mika Häkkinen was fastest
and comfortably fastest</i>

972
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,160
<i>in all of those sessions.</i>

973
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:49,120
<i>Michael Schumacher,
this morning in the warm-up,</i>

974
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,480
<i>was seven-tenths of a second slower</i>

975
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,440
<i>than Mika Häkkinen. Second fastest.</i>

976
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,560
<i>And it is</i>

977
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,480
<i>go at Silverstone!</i>

978
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,800
<i>Now!</i>

979
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,600
<i>The front wheel had smashed the cockpit,</i>

980
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,040
<i>and it was still stuck somewhere in there.</i>

981
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,400
<i>I couldn't get out,
and I was trying to pull my leg out,</i>

982
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,000
<i>which was trapped.</i>

983
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:39,040
<i>So I'm lying there
and notice that I'm calming down a bit.</i>

984
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,720
<i>And suddenly I feel my heartbeat fading,
becoming slower and slower,</i>

985
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,720
<i>until suddenly it stops completely.</i>

986
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,840
<i>And I think,
"This is probably how it feels</i>

987
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,960
<i>when you're on your way upstairs."</i>

988
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,080
I remember I was at home.

989
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,760
And he waved from behind
all those sheets to tell us,

990
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,600
"Hey, everything's all right."

991
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:16,600
That was a moment
when I thought, "Oh my God!"

992
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:18,920
But on the whole,

993
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,440
we'd always made it
through his races safely.

994
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:28,880
Which is why I was certain
he had a few guardian angels

995
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,960
that were keeping an eye out for him.

996
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,000
I don't know if it's just
a kind of protective wall

997
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,920
that you put up yourself,

998
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:53,720
or if it's because you're in a way naive,

999
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,920
I don't know.

1000
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,360
But it simply never occurred to me

1001
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,760
that anything
could ever happen to Michael.

1002
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:16,120
<i>At the end of '99,
they'd had four seasons,</i>

1003
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,480
<i>they'd won some races,
they'd been competitive,</i>

1004
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,720
<i>but more patience was required.</i>

1005
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,160
<i>Now people were beginning to wonder.</i>

1006
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:31,320
<i>Is it ever going to happen
for Michael Schumacher and Ferrari?</i>

1007
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,720
He knew he was a winner,

1008
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,200
that he was a champion.

1009
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,520
We were sure we were close...

1010
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,600
...but we hadn't won the Championship,

1011
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,160
and when that happens,
there are always doubts.

1012
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,840
What concerns me,
I have no opinion about that,

1013
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,640
and that's the natural situation.

1014
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,440
First part of 2000,
things weren't going the way we wanted.

1015
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:16,080
And suddenly, we found ourselves
in the middle of the season,

1016
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,880
at a point where it was difficult
to believe we could win.

1017
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,120
So we were questioning the qualities
of the whole team

1018
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,760
and Michael's as well.

1019
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,440
We now had to win every single race.

1020
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:40,480
Because if we didn't,
we wouldn't become World Champions.

1021
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,320
<i>This is the crunch point.</i>

1022
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,560
<i>Schumacher leads.
Häkkinen is in second place.</i>

1023
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:03,160
<i>Michael Schumacher looks in his mirror
to see whether Mika Häkkinen is there.</i>

1024
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:06,240
<i>Michael Schumacher win at Monza in Italy</i>

1025
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,280
<i>and close the gap
between himself and Mika Häkkinen</i>

1026
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,000
<i>in the World Championship.</i>

1027
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:14,480
This is your 41st victory,
which put you equal second all-time

1028
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,160
with Ayrton Senna.
Do those records mean a lot to you?

1029
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,440
Yes. It does mean a lot to me.

1030
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,720
Sorry.

1031
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,720
Thanks, Michael.

1032
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,520
Mika, over the last two races,
Michael's been magnanimous enough

1033
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,680
to admit that, on the day,
you had the fastest car, McLaren.

1034
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,280
Do you think today
the Ferrari was just the faster car?

1035
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:51,200
Can we have a break?

1036
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,040
<i>The tension is genuinely
well now unbearable.</i>

1037
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,040
<i>My palms are literally sweating.</i>

1038
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:09,800
<i>I am expecting it to be
a nail-bitingly tense race</i>

1039
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,120
<i>every inch of the way.</i>

1040
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,480
<i>The title showdown at Suzuka,</i>

1041
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:20,720
<i>this was his fourth final day
Championship showdown.</i>

1042
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,880
<i>And it probably is the most important race
in Schumacher's Formula One career.</i>

1043
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,880
<i>And Ferrari knew
how quick Mika Häkkinen was.</i>

1044
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,120
<i>He was all about the speed.
He was uncomplicated.</i>

1045
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,440
<i>He just was unbelievably,
inspirationally fast.</i>

1046
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,920
<i>He was almost meditating
with his head down, his eyes closed,</i>

1047
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,080
<i>and just thinking his way
through this race.</i>

1048
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,000
<i>Michael Schumacher needs
to deliver this Championship</i>

1049
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,960
<i>for himself and for Ferrari.</i>

1050
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,880
<i>I think Häkkinen is
totally relaxed, on the other hand.</i>

1051
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:03,080
We had lost the last race
in 1997, 1998, and 1999.

1052
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,200
The same could happen in 2000.

1053
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,840
<i>Watch for that.</i>

1054
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:12,120
<i>Four lights, five lights
in the Japanese Grand Prix.</i>

1055
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:16,320
<i>It's go! And Michael Schumacher
cuts straight across</i>

1056
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,520
<i>and drives Mika Häkkinen towards the wall.</i>

1057
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,320
<i>But Häkkinen has done it again!</i>

1058
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:24,120
<i>He has taken the lead
as he did last year and the year before.</i>

1059
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,480
<i>A terrible bit of news
for Michael Schumacher.</i>

1060
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,080
<i>It's Häkkinen,
the race leader,</i>

1061
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,120
<i>coming in for his first stop
at the end of lap 22.</i>

1062
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:10,120
<i>Michael Schumacher,
of course, is in the lead.</i>

1063
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,720
<i>And he knows he's got
that "Go! Go! Go!" in all this lap.</i>

1064
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,480
<i>And Michael is in. James, are you there?</i>

1065
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,040
<i>I am indeed, Martin.
And I've worked out that Häkkinen</i>

1066
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,800
<i>took on 13 laps' worth of fuel.
That's all.</i>

1067
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,040
<i>7.4. A tiny bit more fuel
for Michael Schumacher. Ah!</i>

1068
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:36,640
<i>Look at this! Here comes
Mika Häkkinen on the right.</i>

1069
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,560
<i>And he's gonna get through
ahead of Michael Schumacher.</i>

1070
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:42,320
<i>The status quo has been retained.</i>

1071
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,080
<i>Out come the McLaren mechanics
for a second stop.</i>

1072
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,280
Häkkinen was leading the race.

1073
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,920
You know, he led the race
for quite a while.

1074
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,720
There was a situation where
we were waiting for the pit stops

1075
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,280
to... to finish,

1076
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:16,680
and I was looking at the track,
and I could see Mika was coming out.

1077
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,360
<i>Häkkinen, 7.4.</i>

1078
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:23,280
<i>These next two laps
could well decide the Japanese Grand Prix.</i>

1079
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,400
<i>Now here is the pit stop. James!</i>

1080
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,680
<i>Yes, he's... Look, he's made
half a second on Häkkinen on this lap.</i>

1081
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,560
<i>He's had a 26.8-second lead.</i>

1082
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,560
<i>Look out, Michael.
When you get out, he'll be there.</i>

1083
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,000
<i>I'll talk you through.
You're looking good. It's looking good.</i>

1084
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,360
<i>It's looking good.</i>

1085
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:45,280
<i>It's looking fantastic, Michael!
Well done. Well done. Fantastic.</i>

1086
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,680
<i>Just keep it on the road now.</i>

1087
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:50,480
<i>Here comes Schumacher
rejoining the track,</i>

1088
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,400
<i>and he is ahead of Mika Häkkinen.</i>

1089
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,840
<i>The horns blow
because they are as keen on Ferrari</i>

1090
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,560
<i>in Japan as they are
in most other countries.</i>

1091
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:13,040
<i>Can they believe it?
Out come the Ferrari mechanics</i>

1092
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,440
<i>to greet home their ultimate hero,
Michael Schumacher.</i>

1093
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,520
<i>You're going on broadcast.</i>

1094
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,360
<i>Give us your feelings for broadcast.</i>

1095
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,760
<i>Shit!</i>

1096
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,320
<i>You are great, Ross! You are great, Ross!</i>

1097
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,120
<i>All of you guys.</i>

1098
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:56,800
<i>Oh my God!</i>

1099
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,520
<i>Shit! We did it! We did it!</i>

1100
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:06,480
<i>Thanks! Give Corinna a big kiss from me.</i>

1101
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,920
<i>Now we will see joy.</i>

1102
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,160
<i>Look at that!</i>

1103
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:07,440
Michael! Michael!
Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael...

1104
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,560
<i>And when he finally
clinched the title in 2000,</i>

1105
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:08,280
<i>all the pressure he'd carried
on his shoulders was released.</i>

1106
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:11,800
<i>He no longer felt like
he owed anybody anything.</i>

1107
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,440
<i>He delivered Ferrari
the World Championship they'd wanted</i>

1108
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:15,760
<i>for 20-plus years.</i>

1109
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,200
<i>And from that point onwards,
everything was a bonus.</i>

1110
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,800
<i>And he drove with freedom after that.</i>

1111
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,760
<i>He drove with his heart.
He drove with passion.</i>

1112
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,920
<i>He drove with a sense, a relaxed sense of,</i>

1113
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:32,280
<i>"This is... I'm doing what I love to do,
but I don't owe anybody anything anymore."</i>

1114
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,320
<i>And he was again onto another level.</i>

1115
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:55,000
<i>Michael was very exciting to watch
through the sheer speed that he achieved.</i>

1116
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:57,600
<i>It was a style</i>

1117
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:03,440
<i>that depended on
100% concentration, 100% commitment.</i>

1118
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:16,600
<i>Going into a corner at 150 miles an hour,</i>

1119
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,880
<i>knowing that your talent
is going to enable you</i>

1120
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:22,080
<i>to get out the other side safely,
it's a special gift.</i>

1121
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,200
<i>Michael got that natural talent,</i>

1122
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:27,040
<i>that natural speed,
higher than anyone else.</i>

1123
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,640
<i>And what was so special
about Michael is that he didn't waste it.</i>

1124
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,520
<i>He did everything he could
to enable himself</i>

1125
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,440
<i>to exploit that natural talent
that he had.</i>

1126
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,840
<i>Michael was a little bit fearless,
and people knew that.</i>

1127
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,200
<i>Not quite sure if they could challenge him
and take him on.</i>

1128
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:53,080
<i>Michael didn't think about it
because he knew his limit,</i>

1129
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:57,960
<i>and the other guys were thinking,
"This is a bit risky," and would back off.</i>

1130
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,200
<i>You didn't see Michael back off.</i>

1131
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:08,040
<i>He was a professional,
but he also showed us he had a heart.</i>

1132
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:11,720
<i>He had the charisma of a leader,</i>

1133
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,640
<i>and that was his great gift to us.</i>

1134
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:20,720
<i>This was the contribution
he made to Formula One.</i>

1135
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,960
<i>Michael Schumacher</i>

1136
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:30,040
<i>gets his seventh
Formula One World Championship</i>

1137
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:34,480
<i>on a truly, truly eventful day
for Formula One racing.</i>

1138
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,280
<i>This is history!</i>

1139
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:44,200
He's been
my idol since I started driving go-karts.

1140
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,400
He's been a big influence.

1141
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:51,920
The racing driver Michael Schumacher
is my hero, my motivation to win races.

1142
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,360
The sport fascinates me,

1143
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:58,560
and I know other racing drivers,
but there was nobody like him.

1144
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:06,120
<i>There was a beauty in the brilliance
of the execution.</i>

1145
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,960
<i>His execution, the teams' execution.</i>

1146
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:13,520
<i>To win on a sustained level
year after year is incredibly difficult,</i>

1147
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,520
<i>and the proof of that
is how rarely it's happened.</i>

1148
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,400
<i>And what Schumacher and the team achieved</i>

1149
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,880
<i>in that period from 2000 through to 2004.</i>

1150
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,120
<i>Not giving an inch to the opposition,
not giving them a sniff of a hope,</i>

1151
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,920
<i>was absolutely incredible.</i>

1152
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,240
<i>He did become untouchable.</i>

1153
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:43,120
<i>People look back at periods of dominance</i>

1154
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:45,320
<i>and think of them as golden ages,</i>

1155
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,440
<i>which they were,
the five Championship years in a row.</i>

1156
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,560
<i>People will always remember it.</i>

1157
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:00,040
When we went to races with them

1158
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,040
and saw all the commotion,

1159
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:08,080
saw how many people
thought he was great and admired him,

1160
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,880
I thought that was totally brilliant.

1161
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,000
And I thought,

1162
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:20,520
"Yeah, that's my dad,
and I'm really glad he's my dad."

1163
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,920
I just have huge respect for Dad.

1164
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,920
I have always had that.
He just has this presence.

1165
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,800
When he walks into a room,
everyone goes quiet.

1166
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,400
That's how I remember it.

1167
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,320
And I was also
one of those who kept quiet.

1168
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:43,480
But like I said, my hero
when he walked into a room.

1169
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,640
So when I think to myself,
every time I look at him, I tell myself,

1170
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,400
"Yes, that's how I want to be."

1171
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,520
Such strength, such total peace of mind.

1172
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,360
At the end of this year,
I've decided together with the team

1173
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:06,240
that I'm, uh, going to retire from racing.

1174
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,280
I should thank my family,

1175
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,360
who at all times

1176
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:14,440
supported what I was doing.

1177
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:19,760
And without their support,
without their strength to survive, uh,

1178
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,080
in this business and this sport,
and to perform,

1179
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:28,360
I think it would have been impossible.
And I can't be thankful enough.

1180
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,280
<i>I retired simply because</i>

1181
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:52,640
<i>I didn't have the passion
and the motivation anymore.</i>

1182
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,760
<i>I was tired.</i>

1183
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:01,600
He found a different
action. He didn't just sit on the sofa.

1184
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:03,360
He had to go here

1185
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:07,200
and there, do this and that,
one thing after another.

1186
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,120
Michael was restless.

1187
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,440
For example, if the weather is nice,

1188
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:23,320
"I could go skydiving!",
but then it's not one, it's 24 jumps.

1189
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:30,040
After he left Formula One,
he thought, "What am I going to do now?"

1190
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:35,480
He asked me, "What should I do?"
And I said, "I'll drive rallies with you."

1191
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:39,440
"I'm not so good at map-reading,
but I can try." And he said, "No way!"

1192
01:38:54,840 --> 01:39:00,240
I think that Michael's comeback was
obviously personal desire and fulfillment.

1193
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,680
He... He didn't have anything to prove.

1194
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,200
But he obviously felt
that he needed to drive,

1195
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,680
and he needed to compete
and to join that... that Mercedes journey.

1196
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:16,440
<i>That was a new phase,
a completely different approach for him.</i>

1197
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,360
<i>He realized he could experience
Formula One in a new way.</i>

1198
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,720
<i>No longer being
a World Championship contender</i>

1199
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:25,320
<i>was exciting for him.</i>

1200
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:28,840
<i>And he enjoyed it up to a certain point.</i>

1201
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:39,720
I was never at his level
in terms of driving performance.

1202
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,920
But I definitely know,
towards the end of my career,

1203
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,600
my last year of 37,

1204
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:49,600
gaps that I was going for
were closing before I got there.

1205
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:53,160
Because I think you just get old.
It's just the journey of life, you know.

1206
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:06,000
We often stayed
overseas between races,

1207
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,720
as it would've made no sense to fly back.

1208
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:14,600
He often said, "What am I doing here?
I miss my family. Why am I so far away?"

1209
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:18,520
"I've realized it isn't
as important as it used to be."

1210
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:22,320
"My family is more important now."

1211
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:08,640
<i>Michael Schumacher,
the most successful driver</i>

1212
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,240
<i>in Formula One history,
is in the hospital...</i>

1213
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:24,000
<i>Michael Schumacher
is in critical condition at this hour.</i>

1214
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,520
<i>Shortly before it happened in Méribel,</i>

1215
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:38,240
<i>he said to me, "The snow isn't optimal.</i>"

1216
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:41,440
<i>"We could fly to Dubai
and go skydiving there."</i>

1217
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,680
Fate is unpredictable.

1218
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,200
Fate had usually been kind to Michael.

1219
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:59,280
But this time, unfortunately,
he became a victim of misfortune.

1220
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:06,520
On 29 December 2013,

1221
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,680
Michael and his family's life
was turned upside down.

1222
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:17,840
The family's life changed completely
from one minute to the next.

1223
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,960
A father, such a strong leader,

1224
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,360
with such a great personality,

1225
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:29,360
and that disintegrated
from one minute to the next.

1226
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:57,280
I have never, um, um...

1227
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,480
blamed God for what happened.

1228
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,520
It was just really bad luck,

1229
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,720
all the bad luck anyone can have in life.

1230
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:08,800
Um...

1231
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,840
It's always terrible when you say,

1232
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:16,120
"Why is this happening to Michael or us?"

1233
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:19,840
But then why does it happen
to other people?

1234
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,640
Of course, I miss Michael every day.

1235
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:53,080
But it's not just me who misses him.

1236
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:55,600
The children, the family,

1237
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:58,040
his father, everyone around him.

1238
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:01,120
I mean, everybody misses Michael,

1239
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:02,400
but Michael is here.

1240
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:04,640
Different, but he's here,

1241
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:10,360
and that gives us strength, I find.

1242
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:35,480
We're together.

1243
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:37,960
We live together at home.

1244
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,560
We do therapy.

1245
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:44,680
We do everything we can
to make Michael better

1246
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,360
and to make sure he's comfortable.

1247
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:52,040
And to simply make him
feel our family, our bond.

1248
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:56,960
And no matter what,
I will do everything I can.

1249
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,040
We all will.

1250
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,600
When I think about the past now,

1251
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:25,440
the images that pop up in my head

1252
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:29,400
are usually of the four of us having fun.

1253
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,600
I see images of us

1254
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:39,240
driving a go-kart in the meadow.

1255
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:43,440
I see images of us
where we're out and about

1256
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,520
with the ponies, sitting on the carriage.

1257
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:50,760
Really many moments

1258
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,840
that resonate with joy.

1259
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:07,640
The highlight was always
when he came home.

1260
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,240
That was so nice

1261
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,560
because he used to
put up with us for hours

1262
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:16,120
after he'd got back,
although he was probably very tired.

1263
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:18,320
But we didn't notice that.

1264
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,360
We were just happy to have him home.

1265
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,280
Yes.

1266
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:38,000
And since the accident,
of course, these experiences,

1267
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:42,240
these moments

1268
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:45,040
that I believe many people
have with their parents,

1269
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,520
are no longer present,
or to a lesser extent.

1270
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,800
And in my view,

1271
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,960
that is a little unfair.

1272
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:24,840
I think Dad and me,

1273
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:29,720
we would understand each other
in a different way now.

1274
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:34,640
Simply because
we speak a similar language,

1275
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,880
the language of motorsport.

1276
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:41,560
And that we would have
much more to talk about.

1277
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,800
And that's where my head is
most of the time.

1278
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,520
Thinking that would be so cool,

1279
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,840
that would be it.

1280
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:03,720
I would give up everything just for that.

1281
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:07,680
Yes.

1282
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:35,400
We're trying to carry on as a family

1283
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:40,160
the way Michael liked it and still does.

1284
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:43,080
And we are getting on with our lives.

1285
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:46,080
"Private is private," as he always said.

1286
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:50,000
It's very important to me
that he can continue

1287
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,680
to enjoy his private life

1288
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:55,480
as much as possible.

1289
01:48:55,560 --> 01:49:00,360
Michael always protected us,
and now we are protecting Michael.

1290
01:49:01,305 --> 01:50:01,227
