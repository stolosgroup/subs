00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,915
# Bring out what's been in me #

3
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:49,543
# Far too long #

4
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,127
# And, uh... #

5
00:00:51,127 --> 00:00:57,718
# That's all
I've been dreaming of #

6
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,345
# Do me, baby #

7
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:03,686
# Like you never done before #

8
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:07,224
# Ahh, ooh, give it to me #

9
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:10,437
# Till I just can't take no more #

10
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:16,734
# Come on, do me, baby,
like you never done before #

11
00:01:16,734 --> 00:01:20,872
# Ahh, ooh, I want you, babe #

12
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,456
# Like I just can't take no more #

13
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:27,414
# Ooh, ahh #

14
00:01:27,414 --> 00:01:31,089
# Hooh-ooh ooh! #

15
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:34,260
# Ooooooooh! #

16
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:35,885
Whoo!

17
00:01:35,885 --> 00:01:36,966
What the hell are you doing?

18
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,466
What the hell?!

19
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,764
I didn't tell you to go!
Goddamn!

20
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:42,262
- It was him!
- That was you!

21
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,352
Shit! Oh, man!

22
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:47,397
Ain't nobody listenin' today.

23
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:51,101
Ladies, you just dented
a '81 Cutlass Supreme.

24
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,903
I need to see your license
and registration.

25
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:54,566
Brother, you OK? You cool?

26
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:05,787
Ten minutes.
Doors open on my signal.

27
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,336
I'm glad you're here, Lee.

28
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,793
I always feel better
with you watching my back.

29
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:13,001
I'm just doing my job,
Mr. Ambassador.

30
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,003
Stay close today, Lee.

31
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:16,209
We're making history.

32
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:21,966
This is bullshit!
Do you know who I am?

33
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:24,219
My family owns
half of Rodeo Drive.

34
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,808
Do you know who I am?

35
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:28,021
Detective James Carter, LAPD.

36
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:29,934
My family owns half of
Crenshaw Boulevard.

37
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:30,940
I want a lawyer.

38
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,438
You need a personal trainer.

39
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:33,808
This license says 180 pounds.

40
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:35,234
You weigh more than
the damn car, girl.

41
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,649
- I have a thyroid condition.
- Well, stop eating thyroids.

42
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:41,822
Look, can't you just,
like give us a warning or something?

43
00:02:41,822 --> 00:02:45,364
That depends.
You girls like Chinese?

44
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:49,955
Excuse me.

45
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:51,162
Carter.

46
00:02:51,162 --> 00:02:52,715
Lee, we are on for tonight.

47
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,753
I just picked up two girls who wanna
play hide the little Asian policeman.

48
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,418
I can't talk now. I'm in the car
with Ambassador Han.

49
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,173
Trust me, these girls
are sushi grade.

50
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:02,472
- We gotta hit this!
- I have to go. I'm sorry.

51
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,019
You're still mad at me, aren't you?

52
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,392
You're mad because of what happened
when we was in New York.

53
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:07,477
I don't want to talk about that.

54
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,854
It was three years ago.
When you gonna let it go?

55
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:12,398
Let it go? Isabella was my girlfriend.

56
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,400
Lee, we're friends, man.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,650
Just come out with me one night.

58
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,648
The mu shu's on me.

59
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,365
Lee!

60
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:20,157
Ha.

61
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,200
My mom says hi.

62
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:27,283
World Criminal Court

63
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:53,525
The Chinese triads now have
half a million members...

64
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,067
in over 100 countries.

65
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:59,737
And these are not street kids shaking down
local merchants.

66
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:04,120
These are businessmen who have built
a $50 billion empire...

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,906
of extortion, drugs,
sex and slavery.

68
00:04:07,906 --> 00:04:13,290
We must cut off the head of this snake
before it swallows us whole.

69
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,456
As chairman of
the World Criminal Court...

70
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:19,334
I have entrusted my good friend
Ambassador Han to lead the fight...

71
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,383
against the largest criminal
organization in the world.

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,598
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:40,238
Chairman Reynard,
ladies and gentlemen.

74
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:46,411
The triad society
is built on secrecy.

75
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,746
Nobody knows who these men are,
who controls them, who leads them.

76
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:53,243
Nobody has known for 500 years.

77
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:57,086
But today, I stand before you
with a secret of my own.

78
00:04:57,086 --> 00:05:01,803
Today, I will disclose information
that affects everyone in this room.

79
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:06,431
After years of searching,
I believe I've finally located Shy Shen.

80
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:10,927
Mr. Ambassador,
Shy Shen does not exist.

81
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:13,940
Excuse me, who is this Shy Shen?

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,520
With all due respect, sir, I le...

83
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:28,160
Everybody down!

84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,791
Call an ambulance!

85
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,905
Someone get a doctor.

86
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,994
Ambassador down,
Ambassador down.

87
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:34,462
Stay with him.

88
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,552
Yugh!

89
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,075
Uh-uh-uh. Keepin' these
till I see you tonight.

90
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:13,492
Attention all units, shots have been fired
at the World Criminal Court building.

91
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:15,578
The Chinese Ambassador
has been shot.

92
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,082
Chinese Ambassador?
Move your asses over.

93
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,166
- Move over!
- What? Whoa. Shit!

94
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,498
What're you doing?!

95
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:01,968
Lee!

96
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:07,883
- Where the hell is he goin'?
- Ah!

97
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,970
LAPD! Get the hell outta the way!

98
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,724
People are crazy.

99
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:18,731
I'm-a give your ass a ticket
when I come back!

100
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,925
Lee, I'm comin'!

101
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:54,351
Ugh!

102
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,443
Don't move!

103
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,740
Hello, Lee.

104
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,746
Don't move, Kenji.

105
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:22,382
Lee, what're you waiting for?
Shoot me!

106
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,138
Maybe this will help.

107
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:38,186
Drop the gun or I'll shoot!

108
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,645
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen.

109
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,736
Kenji!

110
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:52,238
You see?
I know you too well.

111
00:08:56,834 --> 00:08:58,579
Aaaah!

112
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,048
- Ugh!
- Aaaah!

113
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:09,962
- Ungh.
- Lee, you OK?

114
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:15,347
We almost killed your ass.
Why you didn't move?

115
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,015
Ohh.

116
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:21,020
I'd like for you to meet our dates
for this evenin'. Masha and Zoe.

117
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,023
Urgh.

118
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,605
Fat one's yours.

119
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:31,233
How many times
do you want me to say it? I'm sorry.

120
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,119
I'm sorry I ran you over, man. Damn!

121
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:34,449
- Not now, Carter.
- Aww.

122
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:37,457
All right, hold it right there.
Don't say a word, Carter.

123
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,581
Captain Diel, I had nothin'
to do with this.

124
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,708
All I did was borrow a car,
backed up Lee.

125
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,745
Tell him, partner.

126
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:44,250
I need to see Ambassador Han.

127
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,499
The Ambassador
is just out of surgery.

128
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,131
The bullet missed his heart.
He's gonna be OK.

129
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,799
Captain, you have to give me
back my shield...

130
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,680
and put me on this case.
I made one little mistake.

131
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,924
- Take a brother off the bench.
- One little mistake?

132
00:09:54,924 --> 00:09:56,678
You handcuffed two women
and stole their car.

133
00:09:56,678 --> 00:09:58,348
Isn't that why we have insurance?

134
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,063
Everyone has
an off day, Captain.

135
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,687
Last month you put
six Iranians in jail for a week!

136
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,349
You and I both know
them Iranians was terrorists.

137
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,568
They were scientists at UCLA!

138
00:10:07,568 --> 00:10:08,688
Big deal.

139
00:10:08,688 --> 00:10:10,063
'Cause they cure cancer in rats...

140
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,951
that doesn't mean
they won't blow shit up.

141
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:13,696
Let me find the person
who shot Ambassador Han.

142
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,706
Relax, Carter. The LAPD won't be leading
this investigation.

143
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,747
The Ambassador
is my responsibility.

144
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:21,538
Well, then maybe you could
tell me exactly how that shooter got away.

145
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:23,918
Thought so.

146
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:27,422
The Ambassador's daughter
is coming to see her father right now.

147
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:29,383
Make sure nothing happens to her.

148
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,545
Don't worry, Captain,
we're gonna make you proud.

149
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,631
And try not to think about
your wife leaving you.

150
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,135
She'll come back.

151
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,684
Soo Yung's here?

152
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:38,428
I haven't seen her
since she was ten years old.

153
00:10:38,428 --> 00:10:40,514
She lives in Los Angeles now.

154
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,765
Let's go to the gift shop
and get her a little teddy bear.

155
00:10:45,403 --> 00:10:46,517
And a bra.

156
00:10:46,517 --> 00:10:47,526
- Lee!
- Soo Yung.

157
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:49,273
I'm so glad you're here.

158
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,700
- Detective Carter.
- Soo Yung.

159
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,491
- It's been so long.
- So long, Soo Yung.

160
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:56,777
So... So young.

161
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,573
- How is he?
- He's out of surgery.

162
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,625
They said he'll be OK.

163
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:06,923
Soo Yung, I'm sorry.

164
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:12,343
It was my fault.
I didn't get to him fast enough.

165
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,764
I want you both
to promise me something.

166
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,890
I want you to find the man
who did this to him.

167
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,022
I want you to find him because
I don't think he'll stop...

168
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:26,484
until my father is dead.

169
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:28,809
Soo Yung.

170
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:30,897
I need to hear you say it.

171
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,908
OK, I promise.

172
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:34,943
And so do I.

173
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:40,784
Thank you.

174
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:45,253
Soo Yung, your father was addressing
the court before he was shot.

175
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:48,789
Two weeks ago, my father
mailed me an envelope.

176
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,793
He said if anything ever
happened to him...

177
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,092
- I should give it to you.
- Where is it?

178
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,880
I put it in my locker
at the kung-fu studio where I teach.

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,555
It's at 8347 First Street...

180
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,520
Chinatown.

181
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:16,613
Go home, Carter.
This has nothing to do with you.

182
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,826
I made Soo Yung a promise,
the same as you.

183
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:21,452
This is the business of China.

184
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:24,033
Well, for your information,
I'm part Chinese now.

185
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:26,037
That's right, Lee.
For the last three years I've studied...

186
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,121
the ancient teachings of Buddha,
earning two black belts...

187
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,006
in wushu martial arts,
spending every afternoon...

188
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:32,417
at the Hong Kong Garden massage parlour
on Pico and Bundy.

189
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:33,839
I am half-Chinese, baby.

190
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,337
If you're half-Chinese,
I'm half-black.

191
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:39,433
I'm your brother and I'm fly.
You down with that, Snoopy?

192
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:40,976
That's dope, isn't it?

193
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,015
Sorry, Lee, you can't be black.
There's a height requirement.

194
00:12:44,015 --> 00:12:45,269
Same as riding the Matterhorn.

195
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:46,388
Go home, Carter.

196
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,812
I can't leave you, Lee.

197
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:51,268
Can't leave my brother.

198
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:15,800
All right, listen up!
I need everyone's attention.

199
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,222
I'm Detective Carter,
this is Inspector Lee.

200
00:13:19,222 --> 00:13:22,144
We need to see Soo Yung's
locker right now.

201
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,933
No one's allowed in the back
without the master's permission.

202
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:29,021
Maybe you didn't hear me.
We need to see that locker.

203
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,150
- I'm sorry.
- Wait. Carter.

204
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,977
Lee, I got this.

205
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:36,315
Hey! Heh heh. Kids.

206
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,280
Listen. Violence will solve nothin'.

207
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,621
Now, as the Chinese say, all great battles
are won without fightin'.

208
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:43,906
- Sorry.
- OK?

209
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,164
I don't know him.

210
00:13:45,164 --> 00:13:46,281
Now, let's just calm down
and put this...

211
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,491
- Haa!
- Ow!

212
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:48,997
God da...

213
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:54,089
OK...

214
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:55,885
I tried talkin'.

215
00:13:56,804 --> 00:13:59,473
Hoo! Now I'm about to beat
the puberty out of y'all.

216
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,308
You ain't gonna see it comin'.
You ain't gonna see it comin', come on!

217
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,469
Waaa! Whoo!

218
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,472
Runnin' for your lives.

219
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,187
About time y'all showed
some respect around here.

220
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:13,309
- Huh?
- Carter, wait for the master.

221
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:20,946
Whoa! Damn!

222
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:23,659
Heh, I'm sorry, man.
I thought this was the bathroom.

223
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,946
Sorry.

224
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:27,995
Lee, I got a big problem, man.

225
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,411
This boy's on steroids.
He got a head like Barry Bonds.

226
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,668
- Oh, no.
- Come on, man.

227
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:33,750
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaah!

228
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,839
Ah!

229
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,754
Carter, are you OK?

230
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:38,552
Lee, Lee, get him, Lee!

231
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:39,551
Ooh!

232
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:41,216
Ahhh! Ah!

233
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:41,999
Ah!

234
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:44,184
Urgh!

235
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,893
Lee, let's get the hell outta...

236
00:14:45,893 --> 00:14:47,438
Aah! My bunions!

237
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,558
Yah! Hyah! Mm! Ungh!

238
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:52,607
- Grr! Rargh!
- Ha ha ha.

239
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:54,983
Urgh! Whoo!

240
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,447
Oh! Aaaah!

241
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,608
Come on, man, let me go.
I love Chinese people!

242
00:14:58,608 --> 00:15:00,243
Aaaah!

243
00:15:00,243 --> 00:15:01,442
Wait. I don't...

244
00:15:10,212 --> 00:15:11,588
Ah!

245
00:15:11,588 --> 00:15:13,167
Urgh!

246
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,416
How do you say "surrender"
in Chinese?

247
00:15:16,219 --> 00:15:17,213
Aaaah!

248
00:15:18,637 --> 00:15:21,592
OK. I'm about to slice you up
like a giant California roll!

249
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:22,963
Raaah!

250
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:28,970
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
- Ha ha ha. Funny black man.

251
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,439
Ooh... Oh! Shit!

252
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:33,556
I'm not playin' no more.

253
00:15:33,556 --> 00:15:35,277
Ahh!

254
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:37,353
Aaah!

255
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,077
- Lee, let go!
- Carter!

256
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:46,953
Grrrrr!

257
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,500
Down! Put us down!

258
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,081
Let me down! I'm sorry!

259
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,332
- Aaaaah!
- I'm sorry, man!

260
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,300
How the hell did we
get in this mess?

261
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:01,716
- Ugh!
- Agh!

262
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:16,273
May I help you?

263
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,315
We'll be asking
the questions, old man.

264
00:16:19,315 --> 00:16:20,439
- Who are you?
- Yu.

265
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,240
- No, not me. You.
- Yes, I am Yu.

266
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,785
Just answer the damn questions.

267
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,494
- Who are you?
- I have told you.

268
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:27,619
- Are you deaf?
- No, Yu is blind.

269
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm not blind, you blind.

270
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,284
- That is what I just said.
- You just said what?

271
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:34,047
- I did not say what, I said Yu.
- That's what I'm asking you.

272
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,003
- And Yu is answering.
- Shut up!

273
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:36,956
- You!
- Yes?

274
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:38,080
Not you, him!

275
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,255
- What's your name?
- Mi.

276
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:40,838
- Yes, you!
- I am Mi.

277
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,839
He is Mi, and I am Yu.

278
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,885
And I'm about to whup your old ass, man,
'cause I'm sick of playin' games!

279
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:49,142
You, me, everybody's ass
around here! Him!

280
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,474
- Carter, Carter.
- I'm-a kick his ass.

281
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,974
- I'm sick of this.
- Carter, let me handle this.

282
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:53,145
- Lee. No, Lee. No!
- Carter!

283
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:53,926
Go.

284
00:16:56,486 --> 00:17:00,022
My name is Inspector Lee.
We have a key to Soo Yung's locker.

285
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:04,692
Some men came here this morning.
They had guns.

286
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:06,945
They emptied her locker.
I could not stop them.

287
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:08,118
You must go to her at once.

288
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,202
Why?

289
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:13,124
They said she would end up like her father.

290
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:16,127
Let's go.

291
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:17,708
I don't know what the hell
you feedin' him...

292
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,717
- but he is too damn big!
- Carter. Go.

293
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:42,903
Where is everyone?

294
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,486
Where's all the damn cops?

295
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,036
- Lee.
- Where's security?

296
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,325
They were called away.

297
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:55,542
W... What's wrong?

298
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,290
Carter.

299
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,298
Aw, this ain't good.

300
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:02,543
They're coming for him.

301
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,131
What do we do?

302
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:18,021
No.

303
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,393
No!

304
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:27,282
Don't move, or I'll
blow your ass cheeks off.

305
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:28,699
Get back.

306
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:30,068
Ugh!

307
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:32,955
Who sent you?

308
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:34,659
Oh!

309
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:38,833
Don't move!

310
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:44,721
Lee, throw me a gun!

311
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:46,049
- Huh?
- Throw me a gun!

312
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:50,517
- Damn, Lee!
- Huh?

313
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,628
Lee! I thought you had my back!

314
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:23,501
Aaaaaah!

315
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,058
Ugh!

316
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,559
Soo Yung, one more!

317
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,353
Hyah!

318
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,313
Aaaaah!

319
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,903
Lee, I'm in trouble!
I need some assistance.

320
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:50,026
Here.

321
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:52,659
It's empty.

322
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:53,910
What?

323
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,824
Hah!

324
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:04,625
You see? I always got your back.

325
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:06,260
Why the hell you give me
an empty gun, then?

326
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,254
I didn't know.

327
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:10,506
You almost got me killed, Lee.

328
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,892
- Ah! Ahh!
- Who are you? Who sent you?

329
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,562
What the hell is that?

330
00:20:20,562 --> 00:20:21,683
I think he's speaking French.

331
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:23,687
French? What kind of
Chinaman speak French?

332
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:25,238
Tell him to stop playin' around
and talk right.

333
00:20:25,238 --> 00:20:26,901
How can I tell him?
I don't speak French.

334
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:28,358
Ah!

335
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:30,868
Talk right, man.

336
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:33,409
No! You're Asian.
Stop humiliatin' yourself.

337
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,787
Shut the hell up.
Shut up. Come here.

338
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:40,120
We're gonna need a few minutes
alone with this guy.

339
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,372
Find someone here
who speaks French, please.

340
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,664
Speak English!

341
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:50,176
Uh, this is Sister Agnes
from the chapel upstairs.

342
00:20:50,176 --> 00:20:52,970
She speaks fluent French
and has agreed to interpret for you.

343
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,886
Sister, we appreciate you doin' this.

344
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,890
My pleasure.

345
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,433
Sister Agnes,
please ask who sent him.

346
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,235
He says you're both making
a big mistake.

347
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:09,315
That one day soon
you'll beg for mercy.

348
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:10,737
He also said...

349
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,404
What?

350
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,951
Please, Sister, we have to know.

351
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:16,119
There's lives at stake.

352
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,745
Well, he used the N-word.

353
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,875
What? The N-word?

354
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,002
- You tell this little motherf...
- Carter!

355
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,125
She's a nun.

356
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:31,094
Sister, you tell this piece of S-word
that I will personally F-word him up.

357
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,097
Did he say "Negro"?

358
00:21:42,097 --> 00:21:45,193
He used the N-word again, but this time
he mentioned your grandmother.

359
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,982
You tell him
that his mama's a H!

360
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:51,192
Carter, I believe "whore" is
spelled with a W.

361
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,526
Right. W. And his sister's a W.

362
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:55,494
And his grandmama's
a two-big W...

363
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:57,538
who makes double
'cause she got no teeth!

364
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,368
You tell him I said that.

365
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:12,636
Did he say it again?

366
00:22:12,636 --> 00:22:14,680
No. This time he called...

367
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,436
this gentleman a word
that means "cat"...

368
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,189
and another word that rhymes
with "maggot."

369
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:21,304
What?!

370
00:22:22,233 --> 00:22:25,234
Well, you tell him he's an A.W.

371
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:27,809
Uh, Lee,
"hole" is spelled with a H.

372
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,482
I have a dictionary upstairs.

373
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,067
Just call him an asshole.

374
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:38,831
He says you've both been marked
for death, like Han and the girl.

375
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:41,667
Ooh. Sister, turn your back.
You don't want to see this.

376
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,745
Who is Shy Shen
and how do we find him?

377
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,245
Tell us right now or I'll cut your B's off
and shove 'em in your mouth.

378
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,547
- His beads?
- His beads, Sister.

379
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,046
His hairy, stinkin' beads.

380
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,595
Tell me somethin' now.

381
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:54,086
Lee, give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Lee.

382
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:58,929
It's over, brother. It's over. OK.

383
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:00,563
Who is Shy Shen?!

384
00:23:00,563 --> 00:23:01,595
What did he say, Sister?

385
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:03,101
He said "shoot me."

386
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:06,650
Lee, there's no bullets in here.

387
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:10,319
- I'm sorry.
- I am trying to kill somebody, man.

388
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,076
Damn. OK.

389
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,322
You better tell me
something right now.

390
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:15,490
I'll send you right to heaven, man.

391
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,907
- I don't even care no more.
- Carter.

392
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:20,115
I'm marked for death.
I ain't got nothin' to lose.

393
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:23,125
That's right, Sister. Call the Lord and tell
him he 'bout to have some company.

394
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,084
Carter, stop.

395
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:27,080
Tell me something!

396
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,131
- Carter, enough.
- Oh, she's almost done.

397
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:31,590
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned!

398
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,504
He says wait!

399
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,886
- What did he say?
- 50 Franklin D. Roosevelt.

400
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:40,091
Geneviטve.

401
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:41,930
Thank you.

402
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,596
Nice workin' with ya, Sister.

403
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:47,234
Anytime, brother.

404
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:50,899
50 FDR.

405
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:52,899
- It's an address.
- It's a wild goose chase.

406
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,448
Every city in America has
a street named after Roosevelt.

407
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:57,612
- And who is Geneviטve?
- I don't know.

408
00:23:57,612 --> 00:24:00,326
Soo Yung, we're getting you
out of here.

409
00:24:00,326 --> 00:24:01,993
- Why?
- It's not safe for you here.

410
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:03,282
I won't leave him.

411
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:04,955
We have no choice.

412
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:32,188
- Soo Yung.
- Mr. Reynard.

413
00:24:33,449 --> 00:24:34,991
I'm glad your father is OK.

414
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:36,736
My people won't leave his side.

415
00:24:36,736 --> 00:24:38,535
- You have my word.
- Thank you.

416
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:39,819
So, let's go.

417
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:42,156
- Ah.
- Wh... Where am I going?

418
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:45,583
We're getting out of Los Angeles.
It's not safe for us.

419
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:47,709
Just a few days, Soo Yung.
I promise.

420
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:50,417
You'll come with me
and my family to Paris.

421
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:54,460
OK.

422
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:00,802
Wait.

423
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:04,311
You made me a promise.

424
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,857
Don't forget.

425
00:25:19,077 --> 00:25:20,323
My God.

426
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,582
We got a assassin in custody
who only speaks French...

427
00:25:24,582 --> 00:25:27,205
a limo blows up
at the French Consulate...

428
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:31,162
and the next meeting of the World Court
is in Paris, two days from now.

429
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,419
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

430
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:33,504
Yeah.

431
00:25:33,504 --> 00:25:35,301
That we go to Fiji,
we hide out for a year...

432
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,177
maybe change our names,
get jobs as bartenders...

433
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:38,544
and I'm-a call you Kiko.

434
00:25:38,544 --> 00:25:41,428
We have to find Shy Shen
before he finds us.

435
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:42,845
We're going to Paris, aren't we?

436
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,679
Yes. Tonight.

437
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:58,362
Did you know the average French woman
is naked 34 percent of the time?

438
00:25:58,362 --> 00:26:00,159
We are not going there
to meet women.

439
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,286
You have to forget about her,
and let me hook you up.

440
00:26:05,286 --> 00:26:08,246
Hook me up?
After what you did to Isabella?

441
00:26:08,246 --> 00:26:09,913
It was an accident.

442
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:11,379
Besides, you never even
slept with her.

443
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:13,920
Thanks to you.
It was going to happen.

444
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,384
But you just had to ruin it.

445
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:16,666
What did I do that was so terrible?

446
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:19,253
You shot my girlfriend.
In the neck!

447
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:20,629
There's nothing else to say.

448
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:21,802
It's not like she died.

449
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:24,845
So she has droopy eyes.
So she works at El Poco Loco.

450
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:26,396
That was temporary.

451
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:28,936
As soon as she could blink,
the Secret Service took her back.

452
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:32,025
You know what your problem is?
You need to relax, have some fun.

453
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,731
You have too much rice in your diet.
You're constipated.

454
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:36,280
I never should have brought you.

455
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,740
Face it, you need me, brother.

456
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,194
I don't need anyone.
And please don't call me brother.

457
00:26:41,194 --> 00:26:42,236
What is this?

458
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:44,489
Underground gentleman's club
in Paris.

459
00:26:44,489 --> 00:26:46,290
"Club La Passe"? Forget it.

460
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,497
Check out the address.

461
00:26:48,497 --> 00:26:50,910
"50 Franklin D... Roosevelt."

462
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,293
Like I said, you need me.

463
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:58,008
'Scuse me. Can we have one
gefilte fish and some Ex-Lax?

464
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:07,138
Where the bags at, man?

465
00:27:08,522 --> 00:27:11,013
Excuse me, gentlemen.

466
00:27:11,013 --> 00:27:14,108
Commissaire Revi of the DST.
Would you please come with me?

467
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:15,440
Why?

468
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,199
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

469
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:21,781
Oh! Oh! Man!
Goddamn, man!

470
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:25,702
Oh! Man, this is by far the worst airport
I ever been to.

471
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:26,484
Oh!

472
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,911
- Ooph!
- Ah, man!

473
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:31,327
Now that I have your attention,
why don't you tell me...

474
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:33,544
what you cops are looking for
here in Paris.

475
00:27:33,544 --> 00:27:35,874
I told you, man. We on vacation.

476
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:37,378
Just taking in the sights.

477
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,839
Gentlemen, this is my city...

478
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,680
and I'm responsible
if two stupid cops come here...

479
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,338
and get their heads
blown off by the triads.

480
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:49,563
Now, I can't force you to leave,
but I can make the suggestion.

481
00:27:49,563 --> 00:27:54,309
After all, I found this dirty little gun
inside your jacket.

482
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,316
Which means you could both
do 20 years in my jail.

483
00:27:58,316 --> 00:27:59,900
Do we understand each other?

484
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,068
Do we understand each other?

485
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:07,324
Excellent. It was wonderful
meeting you both.

486
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,958
So we can go now?

487
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,871
This will just take a moment.

488
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:14,706
Welcome to Paris.

489
00:28:14,706 --> 00:28:16,208
Oh, shit.

490
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:28,810
Ohh. Ohhh.

491
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,103
- Ahh.
- Where you go?

492
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:33,098
- Ugh.
- 50 Franklin, uh...

493
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:34,187
D. Roosevelt.

494
00:28:34,187 --> 00:28:36,102
No. Get out.

495
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:37,818
- What?
- I don't drive his kind.

496
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,363
- My kind?
- Americans.

497
00:28:39,363 --> 00:28:40,776
I don't drive Americans.

498
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:42,823
- But I'm Chinese.
- Yeah, but you're with him...

499
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,618
and they're the most
violent people on earth.

500
00:28:44,618 --> 00:28:46,991
Always starting wars,
always killing people.

501
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,704
Americans make me sick.

502
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:50,783
Look, man, we are not
in the mood for this.

503
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:53,545
Me and my partner just got violated
by a small Frenchman.

504
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:55,124
Wearing a very large ring.

505
00:28:55,124 --> 00:28:58,796
You're a pathetic bunch of criminals
who always resort to violence.

506
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:00,259
Always push around the little guy.

507
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:02,087
Hey, that stuff ain't true.
America's not violent!

508
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,053
Come on, America is a joke.

509
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:06,048
You lost in Vietnam,
you lost in Iraq.

510
00:29:06,048 --> 00:29:08,633
You can't even beat the Europeans
in basketball anymore.

511
00:29:08,633 --> 00:29:10,139
The Dream Team is dead.

512
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,554
Ha ha. I didn't hear you, man.

513
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:14,973
Talk about the NBA again,
I dare ya. I double-dare ya.

514
00:29:14,973 --> 00:29:17,274
Even your skinny women disgust me.

515
00:29:17,274 --> 00:29:19,188
- Halle Berry.
- Wh...? Aw, hell no.

516
00:29:19,188 --> 00:29:20,443
Now you done gone too far.

517
00:29:20,443 --> 00:29:22,026
You want violence,
smelly Frenchman? Huh?

518
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,825
Do you want violence?
Well, you got it!

519
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:25,818
- Carter, put the gun down.
- Say you love America.

520
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:28,236
I love America.
Please, don't kill me.

521
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:29,610
Sing the national anthem!

522
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:33,493
Not that one, man!
Sing the American one.

523
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:34,914
Don't know it.

524
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:39,417
# Oh, say can you see #

525
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:43,341
# Oh, say can you see #

526
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:47,012
# By the dawn's early light #

527
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:48,974
# Ah-doo da-doo-dee light... #

528
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,215
Wait for us here, George.

529
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,392
Ooh la la. Lee.

530
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,027
Carter, stay focused.

531
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:41,772
We're looking for Geneviטve.

532
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:45,148
Let's split up.
I'll take the women.

533
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,178
Carter. James Carter.

534
00:31:17,232 --> 00:31:19,806
I know you probably don't understand
a word I'm saying...

535
00:31:19,806 --> 00:31:21,145
but I gotta tell you...

536
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,561
you're the most beautiful woman
I ever seen in my life.

537
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:25,862
And I'd like to strip you down
and butter you...

538
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:27,823
like a slice of Wonder Bread.

539
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:31,610
And shave your armpits and pour honey
all over your naked body.

540
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,789
And for the next two weeks
pretend I was a hungry bear.

541
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:39,253
Well, James Carter,
I happen to speak six languages.

542
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:40,998
One of 'em English?

543
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:44,667
Are you in or out?

544
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,008
Money plays.

545
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,009
Sir, it's a thousand-euro minimum.

546
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:53,476
How much I'm short?

547
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:55,470
930 euros.

548
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,686
- Heh.
- It's OK.

549
00:31:57,686 --> 00:31:59,482
Let him play.

550
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:00,597
Thank you.

551
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:01,937
Changez.

552
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:02,940
- Changez.
- Changez.

553
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,977
Changez?

554
00:32:19,086 --> 00:32:20,878
I'm looking for Geneviטve.

555
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:30,299
Maybe I can help you.

556
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,264
Do you know what
I hate about cops?

557
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,099
Even when they're
with a woman...

558
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:43,525
they can't stop thinking
about getting their man.

559
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:46,317
Who is Shy Shen?

560
00:32:46,317 --> 00:32:47,687
See what I mean?

561
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:53,484
Come upstairs, cop.
I'll give you what you want.

562
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:01,247
- Hit me.
- Monsieur, this is baccarat.

563
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,536
I know that!

564
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:04,873
You think I don't know
baccarack when I play it?

565
00:33:04,873 --> 00:33:06,709
When I was a kid,
me and my friends and I...

566
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:08,461
used to hang out in front of
the Magic Johnson Theater...

567
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:10,675
and play baccarack all night long.

568
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,721
Now hit me.

569
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,930
Three kings.
Read 'em and weep.

570
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:26,315
Three kings is a zero.

571
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:28,896
You have the worst possible hand.
You lose.

572
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:30,450
What?

573
00:33:33,203 --> 00:33:34,745
Ah, madame has a 7.

574
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:37,202
She wins 100,000 euros. Bravo.

575
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:39,912
Mr. Carter, it appears you have
brought me luck.

576
00:33:39,912 --> 00:33:42,327
I'd like to bring you
breakfast in bed.

577
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,918
Excuse me.

578
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:58,137
Way to go, Lee.

579
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,351
Today, my boy becomes a man.

580
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:03,940
Why are you helping me?

581
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,351
Maybe I'm helping myself.

582
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,319
How do I find Geneviטve?

583
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,730
I see you like to get right to it.

584
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,402
Do you know Shy Shen?

585
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,237
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

586
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:17,576
Yes, please.

587
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:21,710
Someone's gonna die here tonight.

588
00:34:27,258 --> 00:34:28,539
And it's you.

589
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,915
- Huh! Huh!
- Ugh!

590
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:32,051
- Huh!
- Ahh!

591
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,391
Unh!

592
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:37,885
- Unh!
- Ah!

593
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,221
- Uh!
- Urgh! Ah!

594
00:34:41,221 --> 00:34:44,563
Ohh! Ah! Oh!

595
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:47,022
Ugh! Grrrrr!

596
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:50,318
Ohhh!

597
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:51,948
Ohhh!

598
00:34:51,948 --> 00:34:54,239
Ah! Ahhh!

599
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,485
- Nngh! Guh!
- Oh! Ah!

600
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:57,658
- Gnnh!
- Ahhh!

601
00:35:09,301 --> 00:35:11,507
Come on, crouching tiger,
don't hide that dragon.

602
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:13,137
- Uh!
- Aaah!

603
00:35:25,735 --> 00:35:28,308
Do it, Lee.
You tear that ass up.

604
00:35:28,308 --> 00:35:30,312
- Ahh!
- Oh, oh!

605
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,791
You are a super freak!

606
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:44,204
Carter!

607
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:45,408
Oh!

608
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:46,832
- Run!
- Oh!

609
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:54,709
- Ahh!
- Sorry.

610
00:35:54,709 --> 00:35:56,596
- You got a boyfriend?
- Carter!

611
00:35:58,934 --> 00:36:00,344
Start the car.

612
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:02,891
- Start the car!
- Drive fast!

613
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,658
Carter. Look!

614
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:29,458
Uh, George?
We need you to go faster, man.

615
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,663
No. Forget it.

616
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:34,007
You wanna kill me,
then go ahead, kill me.

617
00:36:34,007 --> 00:36:36,134
- Ahh!
- Drive faster!

618
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,474
Please! I'm scared!

619
00:36:40,474 --> 00:36:42,137
George, you watch
American movies?

620
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:43,259
- Yeah.
- OK, man. All right.

621
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:45,394
Listen, you're a super-spy.

622
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:48,019
A super-spy.

623
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:50,813
Now drive this cab.

624
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:52,527
- Come on.
- OK.

625
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,240
I'm a super-spy.

626
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:08,919
Oh, shit, George. Go!

627
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:14,374
- Aah!
- George...

628
00:37:14,374 --> 00:37:16,176
When I tell you to,
hit the brakes.

629
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:21,304
Now!

630
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,096
Oh, they got guns, Lee!

631
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:29,934
- Ungh!
- Ah!

632
00:37:32,362 --> 00:37:34,153
- Ungh!
- Back up!

633
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:45,911
Argh!

634
00:37:47,043 --> 00:37:49,167
Way to go, George.

635
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:52,586
It's OK.

636
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:57,751
Uh!

637
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:58,795
Aah!

638
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:00,797
Hey!

639
00:38:09,607 --> 00:38:11,149
I got this one.

640
00:38:12,528 --> 00:38:13,772
Aah!

641
00:38:13,772 --> 00:38:16,020
Oh! Whoa! He's got my leg!

642
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:18,738
Aaaah!

643
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,368
Lee! God!

644
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:25,079
- Aaaaah!
- Hold m...

645
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,244
Ah!

646
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,293
Get your own damn cab.

647
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:42,516
Ow!

648
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:43,976
Lee!

649
00:38:43,976 --> 00:38:45,684
- Urgh!
- Yah!

650
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:48,433
Yeah! Whoa!

651
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,803
- Ungh!
- Oh!

652
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:52,686
The French are neutral!
This is not my fight!

653
00:38:52,686 --> 00:38:53,726
This is not...!

654
00:38:56,531 --> 00:39:00,610
Ah! Lee, I'm alive.

655
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,610
My whole life flashed in front of me.

656
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,411
In three years I'll be married
to a Chinese woman.

657
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,249
We had three kids looked just like you,
only a little darker.

658
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:08,246
- Carter.
- What?

659
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:10,076
Put your hands up.

660
00:39:10,076 --> 00:39:12,042
What you talkin' 'bout?

661
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:13,872
Whoa!

662
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,858
Some people say the modern world
was invented...

663
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:36,647
when the French built
these sewers.

664
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,988
10 million gallons pumped
through every hour.

665
00:39:39,988 --> 00:39:43,278
A marvel that no one ever sees.

666
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:45,493
Welcome to Paris, Lee.

667
00:39:45,493 --> 00:39:46,909
Lee, you know this clown?

668
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:50,829
Go on, Lee. Tell him who I am.
Don't be shy.

669
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:52,875
Introduce him
to your shyong dih.

670
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,667
Shyong dih? Your brother?

671
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,334
He doesn't talk about me much.

672
00:39:57,334 --> 00:40:00,461
In fact, he's spent his whole life
trying to forget me.

673
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:03,091
How would it look if Hong Kong's
great Inspector Lee...

674
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:05,754
had a brother on the wrong side
of the law?

675
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:08,341
You're not my brother anymore.

676
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:10,013
Are you forgetting about Chenzhou?

677
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:11,886
Yes, I forgot.

678
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:14,936
You spared my life in Los Angeles.

679
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:18,894
You should have shot me in that alley.
But you didn't pull the trigger

680
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:21,527
because you can't escape your past.

681
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:24,440
I didn't kill you
because I'm not an assassin.

682
00:40:24,787 --> 00:40:27,788
Let me repay the favour, Lee.

683
00:40:27,788 --> 00:40:31,621
I'll allow you to live
if you promise to leave Paris tonight.

684
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:34,415
You got a deal. Thank you
for showin' us the sewer.

685
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:37,126
Listen, that's a badass suit.
Let's get the hell outta here.

686
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:39,707
What about Han and his daughter?

687
00:40:39,707 --> 00:40:41,543
There is nothing I can do for them.

688
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,425
- I have no choice.
- Then I have no choice.

689
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:48,600
Well, I guess he's stayin'.
Who wanna take me to the airport?

690
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:52,805
We'll always be brothers, Lee.

691
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:55,388
In this life and the next.

692
00:40:59,571 --> 00:41:01,445
Tell me, Kenji, who's Shy Shen?

693
00:41:02,783 --> 00:41:05,987
Some secrets are worth dying for.

694
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:09,236
Oh. OK. A... All right. OK.

695
00:41:10,582 --> 00:41:12,824
Lee, what the hell is goin' on?

696
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:20,134
Go!

697
00:41:20,134 --> 00:41:22,009
Hey, which way, man?

698
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:34,346
- Shit, Lee, it's locked!
- Over here!

699
00:41:34,346 --> 00:41:36,063
- Lee!
- We have to jump!

700
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:39,642
- Ooph.
- Oh, that's the sewer!

701
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:41,729
- Hell no, Lee!
- No choice!

702
00:41:41,729 --> 00:41:42,985
- I'd rather die.
- Come on!

703
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:45,065
Oh!

704
00:41:45,994 --> 00:41:50,620
Shi-i-i-i-i-it!

705
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:56,413
I'm gonna kill you, Lee!

706
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:07,426
Bonjour. Welcome to
the Plaza Athיnיe.

707
00:42:07,426 --> 00:42:08,547
How may I help you?

708
00:42:08,547 --> 00:42:11,727
It's great to see you again.
It's been too long.

709
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:13,222
Yes, far too long, sir.

710
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:16,230
Listen, I need a big suite,
two beds, two showers...

711
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,816
a massage therapist, some new clothes
and a case of Old Spice.

712
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:26,233
It's all your fault.
How come you didn't tell me about Kenji?

713
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:28,567
It was none of your business.

714
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:32,493
In case you missed it, man,
people are tryin' to kill me.

715
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:35,370
I'm covered in shit and some French cops
whupped my ass...

716
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,740
with some Yellow Pages, man.

717
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,379
So don't tell me it ain't
none of my business.

718
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:39,873
You're lucky we're not
in Hong Kong.

719
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:41,458
Phone book is twice as big.

720
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,708
Why you didn't tell me
you had a brother, man?

721
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:48,764
Oh, hell, no...

722
00:42:49,683 --> 00:42:50,632
- Lady.
- Oui?

723
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:53,263
This damn dog just pissed on me.

724
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:54,977
Good girl.

725
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:00,396
You know what I think?

726
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:03,523
I think you feel sorry for this guy.

727
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:05,570
Maybe Kenji didn't get away in LA.

728
00:43:07,492 --> 00:43:09,616
Maybe you let him go.

729
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:14,117
The yakuza killed his family in Tokyo.
He was sent to China when he was 7.

730
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:18,667
He was put in Chenzhou,
the orphanage where I grew up.

731
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:20,829
We kept each other alive.

732
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:24,208
You protected each other.
And you're still protectin' him.

733
00:43:25,844 --> 00:43:27,672
I call him shyong dih.

734
00:43:27,672 --> 00:43:30,171
He was like my brother.

735
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:32,305
And then I left him.

736
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:34,301
You was adopted.
What choice did you have?

737
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:36,470
He ended up on the streets.

738
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:39,607
You could never understand.

739
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:41,234
I understand, man.
I got a brother.

740
00:43:41,234 --> 00:43:42,268
My little brother Perry.

741
00:43:42,268 --> 00:43:44,519
We used to be best friends.
Now we don't even speak.

742
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:47,318
He think I tipped off the cops
about his chicken fights in his garage.

743
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:49,863
Can you believe that?
My own brother think I'm a snitch.

744
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:51,695
Just 'cause my chicken lost
in the semifinals.

745
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:52,701
I didn't even really care.

746
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:53,952
- Carter.
- Fight was fixed, man.

747
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:55,950
My bird was fightin' a chicken
that didn't make his weight.

748
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,072
And he still went the distance.

749
00:43:57,072 --> 00:43:59,540
He had a lotta heart.
And he was delicious.

750
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,998
It's best if I do this on my own.
This fight is personal.

751
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:04,633
Lemme help you, man.
I'm-a tell you right now...

752
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:06,177
whatever Kenji's
tellin' you, it ain't true.

753
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,966
- He ain't your brother.
- And you are not my brother.

754
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,591
Huh.

755
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,890
Fine.

756
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:18,184
I'm not your brother.

757
00:44:28,908 --> 00:44:32,954
# What have I got to do
to make you love me? #

758
00:44:35,249 --> 00:44:40,040
# Sorry seems to be
the hardest word #

759
00:44:43,424 --> 00:44:45,048
- # It's sad #
- # So sad #

760
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:46,841
# So sad #

761
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:50,711
# It's a sad, sad situation #

762
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:55,218
# And it's getting more and more absurd #

763
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:58,436
Wow. Holy smokes!

764
00:44:58,436 --> 00:45:00,016
- # It's sad #
- Crash landing!

765
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:03,060
- # So sad #
- Short Round... step on it!

766
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,021
Okey-dokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

767
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:08,782
# Always seems to me #

768
00:45:08,782 --> 00:45:09,979
# That sorry... #

769
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:13,990
Yes, I would like to order
some fried chicken, please.

770
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:16,404
Oh, and some sweet-potato pie.

771
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:18,412
Merci.

772
00:45:18,412 --> 00:45:20,907
Enjoy your mu shu, sir.

773
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:22,959
- Merci.
- Goodbye.

774
00:45:24,882 --> 00:45:26,542
# East Coast girl are 'ip #

775
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:31,176
# I really dig those styles
they wear #

776
00:45:31,176 --> 00:45:34,763
# And southern girls
with the way they talk #

777
00:45:34,763 --> 00:45:38,682
# They knock me out
when I'm down there #

778
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:41,890
# The Midwest
farmers' daughters #

779
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,601
# Really make you feel all right #

780
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:49,229
# And the northerns girls
with the way they kiss #

781
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:53,369
# They keep their boyfriend
warm at night #

782
00:45:53,369 --> 00:45:57,116
# I wish they all could
be California #

783
00:45:57,116 --> 00:46:00,657
# I wish they all could be California #

784
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,251
# I wish they all
could be California... #

785
00:46:04,251 --> 00:46:06,331
Hm. "Geneviטve."

786
00:46:14,223 --> 00:46:15,682
Phew.

787
00:46:19,354 --> 00:46:22,354
- Oh.
- Hello, Inspector.

788
00:46:22,354 --> 00:46:23,768
Minister Reynard.

789
00:46:23,768 --> 00:46:26,693
They want to kill me.
Me and my family.

790
00:46:26,693 --> 00:46:28,770
A dozen agents
from the French secret police...

791
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,865
have already been murdered...
only this last month.

792
00:46:31,865 --> 00:46:34,487
We are at war with the triads,
right here in my own city.

793
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:36,154
Who is Shy Shen?

794
00:46:36,154 --> 00:46:39,531
Ah, Shy Shen... uh...
Shy Shen is not a person.

795
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,083
It's a list.

796
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:43,327
- A list?
- Yes.

797
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:46,335
Every 5 years, the triad bosses
come together...

798
00:46:46,335 --> 00:46:49,838
for an election, and during that ceremony
they choose the men...

799
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:52,214
who will lead the triads.

800
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:54,509
- Dragon heads.
- Yes.

801
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:56,803
13 dragon heads who will control...

802
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:59,560
the largest criminal organization
in the world.

803
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,305
And their 13 names are inscribed
on the list known as Shy Shen.

804
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:07,269
A list which has been handed
down and kept secret...

805
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:10,112
from generation to generation.

806
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:12,865
If the names on that list
were ever to get out...

807
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:16,116
well, the secret society
wouldn't be so secret anymore...

808
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:19,120
and they would all end up in jail,
or dead.

809
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,949
And the list is somewhere in Paris?

810
00:47:20,949 --> 00:47:25,501
A young lady named Geneviטve
made contact with Ambassador Han...

811
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:27,545
and we believe she knows where it is.

812
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:33,095
I'm asking for your help, Inspector.

813
00:47:33,095 --> 00:47:36,298
Finish what Ambassador Han started.

814
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:41,383
Get to the girl before the triads do
and you'll get Shy Shen.

815
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:08,535
Ha ha ha!

816
00:48:19,016 --> 00:48:20,724
Ca va, oui, oui, voulez-vous.

817
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:23,265
I don't understand.
Who are you?

818
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:25,346
- Who am I?
- Oui.

819
00:48:25,346 --> 00:48:29,189
I'm Bubbles.
The new costume designer!

820
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,315
Has anyone seen Geneviטve?

821
00:48:31,315 --> 00:48:33,146
Uh, she has her own
dressing room.

822
00:48:33,146 --> 00:48:33,928
Ah.

823
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,574
Wait. Bubbles.

824
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,454
Uh, do we look OK?

825
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:52,497
No. No, no.

826
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:54,169
These costumes are terrible!

827
00:48:54,169 --> 00:48:57,047
Ladies, please, we have work to do!

828
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,302
First, I will dress the blondes.

829
00:49:46,563 --> 00:49:48,887
And then...

830
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:51,188
the brunettes.

831
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:56,484
And finally...

832
00:49:56,484 --> 00:49:58,151
the hybrids.

833
00:50:02,996 --> 00:50:07,457
The Lord have truly bless you all
with tremendous talent...

834
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:09,251
trust me.

835
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,505
And some of you have
what I like to call...

836
00:50:15,505 --> 00:50:18,961
silver-dollar potential.

837
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,766
# Vous avez lu I'histoire de Jesse James? #

838
00:50:30,315 --> 00:50:33,351

839
00:50:35,154 --> 00:50:38,357

840
00:50:39,826 --> 00:50:41,319
# Et bien... #

841
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:43,532
Lee! What you doin' here?

842
00:50:43,532 --> 00:50:44,534
What are you doing here?

843
00:50:44,534 --> 00:50:46,329
- I found Geneviטve.
- So did I.

844
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:48,040
- They're gonna kill her.
- What?

845
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,953
- Look.
- # Comment il vיcut #

# Ca vous a plu, hein? #

848
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:58,126
- Lee, you get the lights, I'll get the girl.
- Oh.

849
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:01,552
# Et bien, יcoutez I'histoire #

# Bonnie and Clyde #

00:51:37,717 --> 00:51:41,252
# Moi, lorsque j'ai connu

# C'יtait un gars loyal,

# Qu'est-ce qu'on n'a pas יcrit... #

866
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:11,497
- Your life is in danger.
- What the hell's going on?

867
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:15,416
You step into that spotlight,
it's the last step you ever gonna take.

868
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:18,126
They're gonna kill you right now.

869
00:52:18,126 --> 00:52:21,668
- Who are you?
- # On est bien obligי #

# De faire taire celui qui... #

871
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:25,131
James Carter, LAPD.

872
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:27,761
# Bonnie and Clyde #

873
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:30,139
Sorry, James.
It's time for my solo.

874
00:52:30,139 --> 00:52:33,229
# Bonnie and Clyde #

875
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:40,110
You gotta come with me now, girl.

876
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:55,371
# The closer I get to you #

877
00:53:00,426 --> 00:53:05,965
# The more you make me see #

878
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:14,513
# By giving me all you've got #

879
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:22,645
# Your love has captured
meee-ee-ee #

880
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,284
# Over and over again #

881
00:53:27,284 --> 00:53:31,414
# I tried to tell myself that we #

882
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:35,331
# Could never be
more than friends #

883
00:53:35,331 --> 00:53:36,499
# And all the while #

884
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:40,716
# Inside I knew it was real #

885
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:46,920
# The way you make me feel #

886
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,762
# Sweeter and sweeter
love grows #

887
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:53,936
# And heaven's there for those #

888
00:53:53,936 --> 00:53:55,814
- What's happening?
- # Who fooled... #

889
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,190
Get your hands off me!

890
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,857
We are friends of Ambassador Han.

891
00:54:02,857 --> 00:54:04,441
Trust us, girl.

892
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,921
Taxi.

893
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:26,755
Taxi!

894
00:54:26,755 --> 00:54:28,175
- Get in.
- It's George!

895
00:54:28,175 --> 00:54:29,676
Go, go, go.

896
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,473
I've been looking for you
all day, my friend.

897
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:36,559
We need to talk.

898
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,723
Forget it, George.
We're not paying for any damages.

899
00:54:38,723 --> 00:54:40,773
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want you to pay.

900
00:54:40,773 --> 00:54:43,980
I wanna ask if I could
drive you full time no charge.

901
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,021
Why you want to drive us?

902
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:48,483
Today was amazing.
The guns, the shooting.

903
00:54:48,483 --> 00:54:50,865
Now I understand
what it is to be an American.

904
00:54:50,865 --> 00:54:53,623
Please, I'm begging you.
Let me be your driver.

905
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,376
Let me kill someone tonight!

906
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,453
You'll never be an American, OK?

907
00:54:58,453 --> 00:55:00,669
I'll drink this shit all day if I have to.

908
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:02,036
Just give me a chance.

909
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:04,041
All right, fine.
Get us to the Plaza, fast.

910
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,211
You got it, boss.

911
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:07,252
Hold on.

912
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,435
So you think she stole this
Shy Shen list from the triads?

913
00:55:19,435 --> 00:55:21,352
Only one way to find out.

914
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:22,819
You thinking what I'm thinking?

915
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,276
We need her to talk.
Get her relaxed.

916
00:55:25,276 --> 00:55:27,486
Maybe open up some wine
from the minibar.

917
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:29,068
Wow.

918
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,330
Maybe we should put on
a dirty movie.

919
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,407
- Lee!
- Only 9.95.

920
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,160
This our chance to find Shy Shen.

921
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:40,836
I'm goin' in.

922
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:42,202
What's wrong with you?

923
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:43,626
Wait, let me go with you.

924
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,716
Some things a man has to do
on his own.

925
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,269
You OK?

926
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,429
Kenji must have figured out
what I've done.

927
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,516
I'm as good as dead.

928
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:04,527
You stole the list, didn't you?
You tried to sell it to Han?

929
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:09,647
You don't get it.
I'm one of them.

930
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:12,412
And if I'm dead, you're dead.

931
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:24,882
Hey, we're safe.
No one knows we're here.

932
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,211
Just relax.

933
00:56:26,211 --> 00:56:29,669
No one is safe.

934
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:31,138
I'm marked.

935
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,384
Trust me.

936
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:33,932
Now why should I trust you?

937
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,808
As the Chinese say...

938
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:39,970
What does that mean?

939
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,816
"A donkey's lips will not fit
on a horse's mouth."

940
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,527
I'm not sure how that applies.

941
00:56:47,989 --> 00:56:52,153
Well, I was just thinking
you had nice lips.

942
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:55,777
That's all.

943
00:56:56,623 --> 00:56:59,707
You saved my life today.
Thank you, Carter.

944
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:02,462
Oh, please. Call me James.

945
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:03,826
Or Stallion.

946
00:57:03,826 --> 00:57:07,256
No one's saved me
in a long time.

947
00:57:07,256 --> 00:57:08,719
How can I repay you?

948
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:10,345
You got 20 bucks?

949
00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,550
How 'bout ten?

950
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:17,718
Oh, man. Mmm.

951
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:18,890
- James.
- What?

952
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,307
- I'm bad.
- I'm bad too.

953
00:57:20,307 --> 00:57:21,477
I'm a bad girl.

954
00:57:21,477 --> 00:57:23,439
Hallelujah!

955
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,568
Oh, yeah.
That's it, baby. Yeah. Uh-oh.

956
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:35,285
Ha ha. Oh, yeah. That's it, baby.

957
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,742
Oh, yeah. Bite that ear.
Punish that ear.

958
00:57:37,742 --> 00:57:39,160
Do what you wanna do.

959
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,123
Oh, baby... Whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait a minute.

960
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:42,620
My nipples are sensitive.
Be careful down there.

961
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,835
I've never been with
an American man before.

962
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:46,001
Neither have I.

963
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:48,581
I feel so safe with you.
Do you want me?

964
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:51,961
Ha. How you say "Twice now
and once in the shower" in French?

965
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:54,426
Wait here. I'm going
to the bathroom.

966
00:57:54,426 --> 00:57:56,424
Make myself more comfortable.

967
00:57:58,061 --> 00:57:59,436
You need some matches?

968
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:02,273
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

969
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:06,389
Hello, room service?

970
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:08,561
Send me up a bottle of honey
and some Red Bull.

971
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,811
Do you like it?

972
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:42,895
No wonder Lance Armstrong
came all the way here to ride a bike.

973
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,601
Merci beaucoup.

974
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:50,935
Oui, baby, oui!

975
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,277
Oh, yeah.

976
00:58:55,277 --> 00:58:59,697
Voulez... vous
coucher avec moi, baby?

977
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,290
Je t'aime.

978
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,655
Voulez-vous.

979
00:59:03,655 --> 00:59:05,032
Oh, yeah.

980
00:59:05,032 --> 00:59:07,833
Je t'aime, baby, je t'aime!

981
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:12,259
Freeze! Don't move!

982
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:15,177
Ah! Shit! Damn!

983
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:24,640
- I'm shot.
- It's OK, it's OK.

984
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,976
It's just a flesh wound.
It's OK. Gen...

985
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:27,180
Geneviטve, Geneviטve,
let me help you.

986
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,189
- Let me help you, baby.
- I'm terribly sorry.

987
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,439
- I'm OK.
- Where you going?

988
00:59:29,439 --> 00:59:31,320
Je... Damn.

989
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,694
So we even now, huh?
Is that it?

990
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:35,406
I shoot your girl,
you shoot my girl?

991
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,070
I was trying to save your life.

992
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,275
Well, you couldn't wait five minutes?

993
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:40,244
We... We was about to
make love, man!

994
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,244
And you ruin it.

995
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,499
They will be coming for us.
We have to get out of here now.

996
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:46,625
You hear that?
We have to get out of here now.

997
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:48,620
- Damn, Lee! Damn you.
- Sorry.

998
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,539
Next time I'm getting
my own damn room.

999
00:59:53,802 --> 00:59:55,131
Get them out, George.

1000
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:57,890
These people are danger,
they're bleeding.

1001
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,516
How can you bring them
to our home?

1002
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:02,269
Paulette, there is something
you should know.

1003
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,976
I'm not what you think I am.

1004
01:00:05,648 --> 01:00:07,023
Are you telling me you're gay?

1005
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:15,646
I'm trying tell you... l'm an American spy.

1006
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:17,235
Ha. You a spy?

1007
01:00:17,235 --> 01:00:19,318
Yes, I'm working undercover
with the police.

1008
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:20,574
We're about to crack a big case!

1009
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:23,368
Shut your mouth, George.
Not another word.

1010
01:00:23,368 --> 01:00:26,709
You're a stupid cab driver,
like your father was a stupid cab driver.

1011
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:28,169
What kind of case could you crack?

1012
01:00:28,169 --> 01:00:29,582
Can't talk about it.

1013
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:35,838
From this moment on, don't ever ask me
about my business!

1014
01:00:37,056 --> 01:00:39,013
Come with me, schmuck. Now.

1015
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:47,063
We need to get out of the city.

1016
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:50,351
We're not going anywhere till you tell us
exactly what's going on.

1017
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:51,937
Did you steal that list
from the triads?

1018
01:00:51,937 --> 01:00:55,148
Geneviטve, we cannot help you
until you tell us the truth.

1019
01:00:55,148 --> 01:00:57,196
Where is Shy Shen?

1020
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:01,159
It's right here.

1021
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,536
Holy mother of Jesus!
She's a man.

1022
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,197
I went to second base
with a damn Frenchman.

1023
01:01:07,197 --> 01:01:08,621
It's The Crying Games.

1024
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:10,585
I'm Brokeback Carter. Oh, God.

1025
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:12,380
I'm not a man. It's just a wig.

1026
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,624
You sure about that? Huh?

1027
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:16,378
Lee, go over there
and check the hardware.

1028
01:01:16,378 --> 01:01:18,712
If she got anything in her bag
bigger than a three-iron...

1029
01:01:18,712 --> 01:01:20,050
we gonna beat his ass!

1030
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:22,713
I'm a woman, James.
A woman who needs a way out.

1031
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:24,008
You have to help me.

1032
01:01:24,008 --> 01:01:26,060
- You have Shy Shen?
- No.

1033
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,020
I am Shy Shen.

1034
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:39,606
In ancient times, when the triads
would select new leaders...

1035
01:01:39,606 --> 01:01:42,488
they would secretly tattoo
the names onto a woman...

1036
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,665
a woman who could carry
the list of Shy Shen...

1037
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:49,371
to the 35 provinces of China.

1038
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:52,912
When her journey ended
and the new leaders were informed...

1039
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:56,173
the woman would be beheaded
and buried forever.

1040
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:58,631
No records, no witnesses.

1041
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,428
What type of tradition is that?

1042
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:02,637
Have these guys ever heard of
a damn fax machine?

1043
01:02:02,637 --> 01:02:05,560
Kenji made me do it,
said it was a great honour.

1044
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,598
I wanted to do it for him.
For the brotherhood.

1045
01:02:08,598 --> 01:02:10,267
Then why did you
send the names to Han?

1046
01:02:10,267 --> 01:02:12,848
Because I thought the World Court
could protect me.

1047
01:02:12,848 --> 01:02:15,695
But now I see... nobody can.

1048
01:02:15,695 --> 01:02:18,105
You are messed up
in some weird shit, lady.

1049
01:02:18,105 --> 01:02:20,026
I mean man.
Whatever the hell you are.

1050
01:02:20,026 --> 01:02:21,493
I'm a woman!

1051
01:02:21,493 --> 01:02:24,826
And they will send a army to kill me.
To protect their way.

1052
01:02:24,826 --> 01:02:27,154
You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

1053
01:02:27,154 --> 01:02:29,371
Who gonna protect me? I mean us?

1054
01:02:30,502 --> 01:02:31,534
I know a place.

1055
01:02:41,138 --> 01:02:43,510
I won't be here
when you come out. I'm sorry.

1056
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,549
My wife says I can't be a spy,
that I have to be home for dinner.

1057
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:50,847
The truth is I'm a driver.
Nothing more.

1058
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:52,648
This is my destiny.

1059
01:02:52,648 --> 01:02:55,354
I will never know what it's like
to be an American.

1060
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,231
Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

1061
01:02:58,231 --> 01:03:00,031
George, it's OK.

1062
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:02,659
Thank you.

1063
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:04,985
Au revoir. And good luck.

1064
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:07,452
- Au revoir.
- Bye, George.

1065
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:17,547
Minister Reynard.

1066
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:19,922
We have it.

1067
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:25,389
The Shy Shen list?
This is incredible.

1068
01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,755
Some people said it was a myth.

1069
01:03:26,755 --> 01:03:29,685
Naw, it's no myth.
I've seen it. Felt it.

1070
01:03:29,685 --> 01:03:31,431
Kissed it.
But I didn't French-kiss it.

1071
01:03:31,431 --> 01:03:33,480
You do understand
how dangerous this is?

1072
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,941
I was gonna use protection.

1073
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,818
Can we go to the police?

1074
01:03:36,818 --> 01:03:39,572
The triads control
too many of them here.

1075
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:41,945
We have to get you
out of the country.

1076
01:03:42,992 --> 01:03:44,237
Now, my dear...

1077
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:48,194
would you mind taking off that wig
and showing us Shy Shen?

1078
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:50,163
We never told him she was the list.

1079
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:01,468
Look at that. 13 names linked
to centuries of tradition.

1080
01:04:01,468 --> 01:04:04,674
The only real proof
that their secret world exists.

1081
01:04:12,146 --> 01:04:13,806
Ugh!

1082
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,559
Geneviטve, get their guns.

1083
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:27,152
I told you he was bad.
Didn't I tell you?

1084
01:04:27,152 --> 01:04:27,935
No.

1085
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,070
Well, I was thinkin' it.

1086
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,494
The explosion at the embassy.

1087
01:04:31,494 --> 01:04:33,292
As head of
the World Criminal Court...

1088
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:35,499
it would make sense
for me to be a target.

1089
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:37,081
Why did you come to my room?

1090
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,331
Geneviטve was going to be killed.

1091
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:43,719
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

1092
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:46,046
Now, it will end another way.

1093
01:04:46,046 --> 01:04:49,224
Ha ha. It's over, Reynard.

1094
01:04:49,224 --> 01:04:51,766
You know what it's like
for old men in prison?

1095
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:54,891
They call you "pops."
They make you work in the library.

1096
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,272
Your best friend? Gonna be a mouse.

1097
01:04:59,154 --> 01:05:02,237
I'm not going to prison.

1098
01:05:02,237 --> 01:05:04,529
You have a phone call, Inspector.

1099
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:12,823
Hello, brother.

1100
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:14,576
I'd like to make a trade.

1101
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:18,536
Some friends of mine came across
something in Los Angeles.

1102
01:05:18,536 --> 01:05:21,004
Something very valuable.

1103
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,629
Lee.

1104
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,760
Help me, please.

1105
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:30,385
Do we understand each other?

1106
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:31,556
What do you want?

1107
01:05:31,556 --> 01:05:33,352
Shy Shen.

1108
01:05:33,352 --> 01:05:36,225
You and Geneviטve
will meet me alone tonight.

1109
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:40,812
If I see your partner
or any other cops, the girl dies.

1110
01:05:41,696 --> 01:05:42,894
Where?

1111
01:05:42,894 --> 01:05:48,150
Jules Verne restaurant, midnight.
Don't be late.

1112
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:24,770
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

1113
01:06:57,647 --> 01:07:00,220
Welcome to the party, Lee.

1114
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:03,857
Tonight we celebrate
the return of Shy Shen...

1115
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,864
and the return of my brother.

1116
01:07:06,864 --> 01:07:08,573
Where is Soo Yung?

1117
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:17,824
Ungh.

1118
01:07:25,551 --> 01:07:27,093
This sword has a past.

1119
01:07:27,093 --> 01:07:30,927
And like ours, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

1120
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:32,558
Urgh!

1121
01:07:34,769 --> 01:07:38,433
Hundreds of years ago
the triads would kill their enemies...

1122
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,764
with 100 cuts to the body.

1123
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:44,358
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

1124
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:48,110
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

1125
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:52,907
You have just experienced
your first cut.

1126
01:07:53,955 --> 01:07:56,161
If anything happens to Soo Yung...

1127
01:07:57,625 --> 01:08:01,244
You could never kill me, Lee.
We both know that.

1128
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,376
You know nothing about me.

1129
01:08:03,376 --> 01:08:08,090
I know you have no wife,
no children, no family.

1130
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:11,463
Your life ended when we were kids,
back in Chenzhou.

1131
01:08:16,894 --> 01:08:19,931
You have nothing. Just like me.

1132
01:08:21,065 --> 01:08:22,975
I wouldn't say nothin'!

1133
01:08:27,448 --> 01:08:29,818
He has me.

1134
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:32,113
His brother from another mother.

1135
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:40,042
Where is she?

1136
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:41,833
Enjoying the view.

1137
01:08:45,632 --> 01:08:46,747
Soo Yung!

1138
01:08:46,747 --> 01:08:48,466
Lee!

1139
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:51,631
Help.

1140
01:08:53,849 --> 01:08:55,093
Let her go.

1141
01:08:55,093 --> 01:08:56,677
What the hell is wrong with you?

1142
01:08:56,677 --> 01:08:58,262
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

1143
01:08:58,262 --> 01:08:59,931
Get her in here!

1144
01:09:00,897 --> 01:09:02,771
Carter, drop the gun.

1145
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,234
Get her off that damn rope,
or I'm shootin' you...

1146
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:05,942
and the damn Temptations.

1147
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:07,108
Right now!

1148
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:10,988
Oh, no! Lee!

1149
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:13,898
Lee.

1150
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:15,655
- Do it!
- Put her down!

1151
01:09:15,655 --> 01:09:17,289
I'm serious!

1152
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:19,786
I'm not playin'!

1153
01:09:19,786 --> 01:09:22,365
You ain't my damn brother.

1154
01:09:22,365 --> 01:09:23,539
Kenji.

1155
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:25,538
- Drop the gun.
- No.

1156
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:26,661
Drop it, Carter.

1157
01:09:27,758 --> 01:09:29,216
Shit.

1158
01:09:29,216 --> 01:09:30,879
Damn it.

1159
01:09:35,223 --> 01:09:37,132
- Tonight I lose a brother.
- Aah!

1160
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:46,395
Get him, Lee!

1161
01:09:48,404 --> 01:09:50,063
Gonna get your ass kicked, Kenji.

1162
01:10:02,793 --> 01:10:04,703
Come on, kill him already!

1163
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:15,131
Lee, he might be your brother,
but turn him into your sister.

1164
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:32,937
Watch out!

1165
01:10:37,871 --> 01:10:39,447
Yeah!

1166
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,199
Bring your little ass here.
Come here.

1167
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:46,078
Aaaargh.

1168
01:10:46,078 --> 01:10:47,451
Give me your hand.

1169
01:10:52,301 --> 01:10:53,761
Nnngh!

1170
01:10:56,515 --> 01:10:57,296
Ah!

1171
01:11:00,811 --> 01:11:02,685
- Grrrah!
- Aaaah!

1172
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:06,565
Lee? Lee!

1173
01:11:06,858 --> 01:11:08,815
- Gnn!
- Hold on, I'm comin'!

1174
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,119
Get the hell off me.

1175
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:25,783
Oh.

1176
01:11:36,555 --> 01:11:38,180
Yeah, Lee!

1177
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:40,849
Whoo!

1178
01:11:41,977 --> 01:11:43,140
Whoa!

1179
01:12:20,642 --> 01:12:22,681
Yaaaaah!

1180
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:30,609
Ah! Ahhhh!

1181
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:33,066
Ahh... ah...

1182
01:12:33,066 --> 01:12:34,946
Ahhhh! God da...

1183
01:13:08,272 --> 01:13:09,601
Enough, Kenji!

1184
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:11,315
Grrrargh!

1185
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,035
Aaaaah!

1186
01:13:29,377 --> 01:13:31,915
Rrrraaaargh!

1187
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:41,584
Rrrraargh!

1188
01:13:42,890 --> 01:13:45,132
Hoh hoh hoh hoh
hoh hoh hoh!

1189
01:13:46,478 --> 01:13:50,310
# Everybody was
kung-fu fightin' #

1190
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:52,640
# The man was fast as ligh... #

1191
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,360
Soo Yung!

1192
01:13:58,073 --> 01:13:59,732
Aaaaah!

1193
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,496
What are you waiting for? Do it!

1194
01:14:13,464 --> 01:14:14,662
Ah!

1195
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:18,009
Ungh!

1196
01:14:22,765 --> 01:14:24,389
Let go.

1197
01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:25,850
Or we're both gonna die.

1198
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:27,560
No! I can save you.

1199
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,473
Ungh. Grrn.

1200
01:14:34,693 --> 01:14:35,974
Guh.

1201
01:14:37,613 --> 01:14:38,728
Goodbye, Lee.

1202
01:14:38,728 --> 01:14:40,020
No, Kenji!

1203
01:14:44,578 --> 01:14:45,361
No!

1204
01:14:50,835 --> 01:14:51,997
Aaah!

1205
01:14:56,007 --> 01:14:57,631
Ah...

1206
01:15:02,388 --> 01:15:03,799
Gah!

1207
01:15:04,683 --> 01:15:05,797
Unh.

1208
01:15:07,852 --> 01:15:08,603
Aaaah!

1209
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:17,895
I'm comin', Soo Yung!

1210
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:24,778
Oh, my God!

1211
01:15:25,952 --> 01:15:28,444
What the hell am I doin' up here?

1212
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:31,534
Aah! Help.

1213
01:15:34,671 --> 01:15:37,043
Stay cool, lady.
This doesn't have to end this way.

1214
01:15:38,509 --> 01:15:41,081
Don't do it. Don't do it, lady.

1215
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:42,885
Don't you do it!

1216
01:15:43,764 --> 01:15:45,222
Think about what you doin'.

1217
01:15:45,222 --> 01:15:46,765
Please.

1218
01:15:46,765 --> 01:15:48,594
Please. No.

1219
01:15:48,594 --> 01:15:50,227
Hey. Hey!

1220
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:53,638
Would you like to know
a secret, cop?

1221
01:15:53,638 --> 01:15:54,419
No.

1222
01:15:57,694 --> 01:15:58,857
Please.

1223
01:15:58,857 --> 01:16:01,484
Aaah! Oh, no! No!

1224
01:16:01,484 --> 01:16:02,265
No!

1225
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:04,950
Aaaah!

1226
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,066
Ah!

1227
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:08,035
Aaah!

1228
01:16:08,035 --> 01:16:09,948
Ah! Aaah!

1229
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:11,583
Ah! Aaaaaaah!

1230
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:12,912
Oh! Oh.

1231
01:16:12,912 --> 01:16:13,951
Oh.

1232
01:16:27,767 --> 01:16:29,308
Huh!

1233
01:16:29,935 --> 01:16:30,810
Uh! Uh!

1234
01:16:32,562 --> 01:16:33,345
Uh!

1235
01:16:38,777 --> 01:16:41,351
Lee! You shoulda seen us, man.
We whupped their ass.

1236
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,654
Soo Yung!

1237
01:16:43,654 --> 01:16:45,318
I'm OK.

1238
01:16:47,453 --> 01:16:48,532
Oh, shit!

1239
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,783
Call the police.

1240
01:17:27,034 --> 01:17:27,984
Ungh!

1241
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:43,005
Ohhhhh!

1242
01:17:47,848 --> 01:17:49,009
Ah... yah!

1243
01:17:49,009 --> 01:17:50,343
Yeah!

1244
01:17:50,343 --> 01:17:51,678
Whoa! Whoa!

1245
01:17:51,678 --> 01:17:53,891
Whoa-oa! Whoa!

1246
01:17:53,891 --> 01:17:55,603
Rah! Hah! Carter!

1247
01:17:55,603 --> 01:17:57,099
- Hold on!
- Aaah!

1248
01:17:57,816 --> 01:18:00,354
Ah! Yaaaaah!

1249
01:18:00,354 --> 01:18:01,856
- Aaaaah!
- Aaah!

1250
01:18:01,856 --> 01:18:03,569
Gnn.

1251
01:18:03,569 --> 01:18:04,603
Ah! Oh!

1252
01:18:04,603 --> 01:18:06,773
- Hang on!
- Lee! Reel me in.

1253
01:18:06,773 --> 01:18:09,155
- I got you!
- Black people don't fly.

1254
01:18:09,155 --> 01:18:10,952
Get me up. Get me up.

1255
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:12,994
Come on, man. Hurry up.

1256
01:18:12,994 --> 01:18:14,280
Ungh.

1257
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,291
Oh! Lee! Get me outta here!

1258
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:20,461
Ungh. Argh. Ah.

1259
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:21,626
Don't let go of that flag!

1260
01:18:21,626 --> 01:18:23,375
- Argh.
- Ah!

1261
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,506
Ungh.

1262
01:18:25,506 --> 01:18:26,875
Ah!

1263
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:29,128
- Ah.
- Thank you, Lee.

1264
01:18:34,561 --> 01:18:36,103
Carter! Hold on to the flag!

1265
01:18:36,103 --> 01:18:37,599
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1266
01:18:37,599 --> 01:18:39,813
- Aaaaah!
- Aaaaah!

1267
01:18:41,234 --> 01:18:44,485
- Aaaaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1268
01:18:44,485 --> 01:18:46,066
- Aaaah!
- Aaaah!

1269
01:18:46,066 --> 01:18:47,152
Aaaah!

1270
01:18:47,152 --> 01:18:49,233
Aaaaaaaah!

1271
01:18:56,667 --> 01:19:00,450
Lee, I'm gonna kill you
if we don't die!

1272
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:05,216
- Aaaah!
- Aaaaaah!

1273
01:19:05,216 --> 01:19:08,503
Oh, dear Lord, please!
Baby Jesus, help us!

1274
01:19:10,347 --> 01:19:14,215
- Aaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaah!

1275
01:19:16,145 --> 01:19:18,185
Lee! Where you at?

1276
01:19:18,185 --> 01:19:20,560
I'm drownin'! I'm drownin'!

1277
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,104
Get this thing off me, Lee!

1278
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:29,157
- Carter.
- What?

1279
01:19:29,157 --> 01:19:31,994
I'm not constipated anymore.

1280
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:43,461
Put your hands up.

1281
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:44,663
Geneviטve.

1282
01:19:44,663 --> 01:19:46,914
Hey, man, you're the head
of the World Court.

1283
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:49,215
What you gonna do,
shoot us down like animals?

1284
01:19:49,215 --> 01:19:50,548
We're police officers.

1285
01:19:50,548 --> 01:19:53,473
Yes. And you two
just killed this girl.

1286
01:19:53,473 --> 01:19:54,933
Blew her brains out.

1287
01:19:56,978 --> 01:19:58,141
- Carter!
- Don't do it!

1288
01:20:20,627 --> 01:20:22,038
Carter.

1289
01:20:22,038 --> 01:20:24,585
- You all right?
- Put the gun down.

1290
01:20:24,585 --> 01:20:26,416
I followed you.

1291
01:20:28,426 --> 01:20:30,633
Case closed.

1292
01:20:37,603 --> 01:20:39,261
Good job, man.

1293
01:20:50,115 --> 01:20:51,822
Hey, man! You touch me again...

1294
01:20:51,822 --> 01:20:53,450
you gonna owe me
dinner and a movie.

1295
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:54,566
Congratulations.

1296
01:20:54,566 --> 01:20:57,745
It appears we have finally
brought down the triads.

1297
01:20:57,745 --> 01:20:59,491
- We?!
- You didn't do shit.

1298
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:00,864
My butt still hurts.

1299
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,420
The Americans and the French...

1300
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,077
need to work together
in the spirit of brotherhood.

1301
01:21:06,077 --> 01:21:08,046
Together, we can do anything.

1302
01:21:08,046 --> 01:21:09,710
Anything! Ha ha ha.

1303
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,842
He's right, Lee.
Together, we can do anything.

1304
01:21:11,842 --> 01:21:12,925
You go this way...

1305
01:21:12,925 --> 01:21:14,508
And I'll go that way.

1306
01:21:17,893 --> 01:21:18,806
# War #

1307
01:21:18,806 --> 01:21:20,970
# Huh, yeah #

1308
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,972
# What is it good for? #

1309
01:21:22,972 --> 01:21:24,560
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1310
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,477
# Uh-huh #

1311
01:21:26,477 --> 01:21:27,483
# War #

1312
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,397
# Huh, yeah #

1313
01:21:29,397 --> 01:21:31,694
# What is it good for? #

1314
01:21:31,694 --> 01:21:33,359
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1315
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:34,944
# Say it again, y'all #

1316
01:21:34,944 --> 01:21:35,948
# War #

1317
01:21:35,948 --> 01:21:38,195
# Huh, look out #

1318
01:21:38,195 --> 01:21:40,282
# What is it good for? #

1319
01:21:40,282 --> 01:21:41,785
- # Absolutely #
- # Nothin' #

1320
01:21:41,785 --> 01:21:42,790
# Listen to me #

1321
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:43,871
# Ohhhh, war! #

1322
01:21:45,671 --> 01:21:47,331
That's right, Lee.
For the last 3 years...

1323
01:21:47,331 --> 01:21:49,415
I've studied the ancient teaching
of booty. Ev...

1324
01:21:49,415 --> 01:21:51,501
Oh, booty. Ha ha ha ha!

1325
01:21:51,501 --> 01:21:53,005
Cheese!

1326
01:21:53,005 --> 01:21:54,673
- Ha ha ha!
- "Cheese"?

1327
01:21:54,673 --> 01:21:57,088
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
- What?

1328
01:21:57,088 --> 01:21:59,389
- Freeze.
- Oh, freeze!

1329
01:22:00,353 --> 01:22:02,808
As soon as she could blink,
the s... seafood service...

1330
01:22:02,808 --> 01:22:04,688
- Seaf... seafood...
- Secret Service.

1331
01:22:04,688 --> 01:22:06,019
As soon as sh... she could blink...

1332
01:22:06,019 --> 01:22:08,018
the sheafood shervish...
Uh, swa...

1333
01:22:08,018 --> 01:22:09,226
Secret Service.

1334
01:22:09,226 --> 01:22:11,693
The ssssseaf...

1335
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,525
Secret, not seafood.

1336
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:14,944
I know seafood.

1337
01:22:14,944 --> 01:22:16,280
- I know secret.
- Secret.

1338
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,911
- Secret.
- Secret. See?

1339
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:20,831
But when everything together,
it become a seafood!

1340
01:22:20,831 --> 01:22:22,953
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1341
01:22:22,953 --> 01:22:24,750
Action!

1342
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,042
- I'm sorry! So sorry.
- It came off.

1343
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,505
Action!

1344
01:22:28,505 --> 01:22:30,084
- Oh, shit. You all right?
- Yeah, good.

1345
01:22:30,084 --> 01:22:32,844
That was my... Muhammad Ali swing, man!

1346
01:22:32,844 --> 01:22:34,719
Yeah, baby!

1347
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:38,260
Ooh.

1348
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:40,307
- Oh.
- Whoa.

1349
01:22:40,307 --> 01:22:42,053
- That's the one, Mama.
- That would have been it.

1350
01:22:42,053 --> 01:22:43,260
I'm sick of you, Kenji.

1351
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,724
You been tryin' to kill us
ever since the start of this damn movie.

1352
01:22:47,818 --> 01:22:49,774
- Raaaaah!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1353
01:22:49,774 --> 01:22:50,557
Ah!

1354
01:22:52,155 --> 01:22:53,235
Ah!

1355
01:22:53,235 --> 01:22:54,272
Action.

1356
01:22:55,868 --> 01:22:56,982
Action.

1357
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:58,901
Action.

1358
01:22:58,901 --> 01:23:00,276
Ooph!

1359
01:23:00,276 --> 01:23:01,699
You OK?

1360
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:05,372
So her eye is a little
droopy now and she's...

1361
01:23:05,372 --> 01:23:07,453
So she's working for
El Loc... Lar El Poco.

1362
01:23:07,453 --> 01:23:08,791
- Ha ha ha.
- I'm sorry.

1363
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:10,161
It's El Pollo Loco.

1364
01:23:10,161 --> 01:23:12,927
So sh... now she works at
El Lolo Poco.

1365
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:14,173
El Pollo Loco.

1366
01:23:14,173 --> 01:23:16,336
El Lo... Loro Poco. Uh.

1367
01:23:16,336 --> 01:23:17,508
El Poco Loco.

1368
01:23:17,508 --> 01:23:18,712
El Loco Poco.

1369
01:23:18,712 --> 01:23:21,132
So... so she works at Elo... Loco Poco,

1370
01:23:22,269 --> 01:23:23,217
Ha ha!

01:23:23,217 --> 01:23:25,518
And... So she works for
El L... Loro Poco.

1372
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:27,727
- Ha ha ha.
- El Pollo Loco.

1373
01:23:27,727 --> 01:23:29,310
- No, we gonna go past that...
- Ha ha ha!

1374
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:30,598
...'cause I'm not gettin' that tonight.

1375
01:23:30,598 --> 01:23:31,857
El Pollo Loco.

1376
01:23:31,857 --> 01:23:33,736
El... Ohh! Jackie!

1377
01:23:33,736 --> 01:23:35,365
- El Pollo Loco!
- Whoo!

1378
01:23:43,207 --> 01:23:44,487
The mom's gone.

1379
01:23:45,710 --> 01:23:47,252
Maybe we should
put on a dirty movie.

1380
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:48,616
Lee!

1381
01:23:48,616 --> 01:23:50,753
- I like the ones with a story.
- What?

1382
01:23:50,753 --> 01:23:53,129
- I like the one with a locker-room scene.
- What?

1383
01:23:53,129 --> 01:23:54,711
I like the one with a prison scene.

1384
01:23:54,711 --> 01:23:56,083
I like the one with a shower scene.

1385
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:57,589
I like the ones with a white girl.

1386
01:23:57,589 --> 01:23:59,008
I'm into feet.

1387
01:23:59,008 --> 01:24:00,758
I like the one with the horses.

1388
01:24:00,758 --> 01:24:02,475
- What's that mean?
- Damn.

1389
01:24:02,475 --> 01:24:03,723
What he teach me?

1390
01:24:03,723 --> 01:24:04,926
That's it, one more, one more.
Last one.

1391
01:24:04,926 --> 01:24:06,350
Are you teaching me a bad word?

1392
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:07,932
I like the one with hairy woman.

1393
01:24:07,932 --> 01:24:09,102
What's wrong with you?

1394
01:24:09,102 --> 01:24:10,305
I don't know. Brett Ratner tell...

1395
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:12,309
- teach me that.
- He'll teach you anything.

1396
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:14,028
And you're not my brother.

1397
01:24:14,028 --> 01:24:16,818
I'm not your brother?

1398
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,947
All the stuff we've been through?

1399
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:22,328
Rush Hour 1, Rush Hour 2?

1400
01:24:23,414 --> 01:24:25,572
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

1414

# Fragrancing some beautiful ladies,
the lights #

1415
01:25:06,413 --> 01:25:08,373
# The ambiance here,
this is the life #

1416
01:25:08,373 --> 01:25:10,832
# The money,

1417
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:12,200

1420
01:25:17,427 --> 01:25:19,468
# I am here #

1421
01:25:19,468 --> 01:25:21,927
# This is the place #

1422
01:25:21,927 --> 01:25:26,095
# The atmosphere of espionage
and expensive taste #

1423
01:25:26,095 --> 01:25:31,525
# And each one that I see
is an unfamiliar face #

1424
01:25:31,525 --> 01:25:35,938
# So I guess I'll just cut
straight to the chase #

1425
01:25:35,938 --> 01:25:42,115
# And before I could say
the name of who I came to see #

1432
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:06,799

I'd put a picket fence #

01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:37,043
# Funny how time flies
when you're having fun #

1440
01:26:37,043 --> 01:26:38,544
# Yeah, you know #

1441
01:26:38,544 --> 01:26:41,090
# But I got to do
what must be done #

1442
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,668
# We're on a winning streak,
we survived the killing streets #

1443
01:26:43,668 --> 01:26:46,219
# Now you at the crap table
where the real villains meet #

1444
01:26:46,219 --> 01:26:48,052
# Number 7 might get you to heaven #

1445
01:26:48,052 --> 01:26:50,469
# You break the bank,
just might make you a legend #

1446
01:26:50,469 --> 01:26:52,935
# 'Cause after 11
you plan to get some poker face #

1447
01:26:52,935 --> 01:26:55,231
# Genie eyes, light green,
sipping on Bellinis #

1448
01:26:55,231 --> 01:26:57,191
# You play your cards right,
she'll let you touch #

1449
01:26:57,191 --> 01:26:59,566
# She be a devil in disguise, lady incubus #

1450
01:26:59,566 --> 01:27:01,114
# Better know who to trust #

1451
01:27:01,114 --> 01:27:04,402
# She might roll with thugs
who roll bodies up in Asian rugs #

1452
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:05,905
# I'm-a rush up and move on 'em #

1453
01:27:05,905 --> 01:27:07,240
# Put the ooze on 'em #

1454
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,699
# The crews do somethin' new
and formal, yeah #

1455
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:15,454
# I have less than an hour #

1456
01:27:15,454 --> 01:27:18,382
# Ohh, time rolls away, baby #

1457
01:27:18,382 --> 01:27:24,671
# I have less than an hour #

1458
01:27:24,671 --> 01:27:28,714
# Whoo, mmm #

1459
01:27:28,714 --> 01:27:35,179
# I'm in the pursuit
of my own personal power #

1460
01:27:35,179 --> 01:27:38,975
# And I only have an hour #

1461
01:27:39,305 --> 01:28:39,869
