[horn honking]

7
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:51,184
All right, baby. So, what color
do you want for your beach umbrella?

8
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:54,605
I picked indigo.
Shit, I don't even know what indigo is.

9
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,649
Also, look. Do you want a girl or a guy
for our couples massage?

10
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:00,902
Ooh. I don't actually think
I want a couples massage with you.

11
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:01,820
Why not?

12
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:05,407
Well, baby, because you're always moaning
and groaning and saying stuff like,

13
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,993
"Ooh, yeah. Right there. Right there.
Ooh, yeah. Don't stop." [sighs]

14
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,202
Yeah. I be into it, man.

15
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:12,331
When they touching the right spot, can't
help but let 'em know how good it is.

16
00:01:12,414 --> 00:01:13,915
The masseuse likes that.

17
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:15,959
And plus, I have so much tension, baby.

18
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,087
Maybe you wouldn't have so much tension
if you weren't always on your phone.

19
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,423
Baby, I'm working on four projects
at the same time.

20
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:23,425
We gotta use different builders
all across the city.

21
00:01:23,508 --> 00:01:24,468
You know...

22
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:27,137
- But you know what? You're right.
- Hmm.

23
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,307
I'ma put this away, and no more phones
for the rest of this vacation.

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,767
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh, hold up.

25
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:35,854
Hi, Daddy.
No, this is fine. We just landed.

26
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:38,231
Yeah. Marcus, there he is.

27
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:41,443
[Latin music continues]

28
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,532
Yeah, Daddy. The flight was fine.
Yeah, I'm here with Marcus.

29
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,411
Still.
[whispering] We have talked about this.

30
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:54,790

00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,754
Can you connect me with Maurillio?

34
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,799
Speaking, Mr. Parker.

35
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:05,008
How'd you know it was me?

36
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,135
Uh, let's just say
after eight or nine calls,

37
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,097
I become very much acquainted
with the timbre of your voice.

38
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,766
I'm just calling you to confirm
you set up everything we discussed.

39
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,935
Yes. Yes, yes.
I have personally seen to it.

00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:17,521

the rose petals in the bed,

the Bill Withers playlist
"Greatest Hits: No Deep Cuts."

42
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:24,361
Sir, if she says no after all this,
I will marry you.

43
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,988
All right, Maurillio. Not... Not you too...

44
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,324

[Maurillio] <i>Sir? You trailed off.</i>

47
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,580
All good. <i>Gracias.</i>

48
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,916
Oh, baby, look at those two.

49
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,335
- What? These lunatics?
- What? No.

50
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:43,046
They look like they're having fun.
We should try that.

51
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,840
- That looks fun to you?
- Yes.

52
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,676
That's the reason why you don't see a lot
of Black paraplegics. You know why?

53
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,219
'Cause we don't do stupid shit like that.

54
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,805
Look at 'em. They riding around
like they got no insurance.

[engine revving]

56

[woman] Oh, my God. This is the hotel?

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,983
Maybe it's not too late for us to get a
room at the Best Western by the airport.

00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,653
[both laughing]

I'm Maurillio, the manager.

guajillo-cacao rub.

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,957
Oh. I don't know what this is, but cheers!

63
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,001
You must be very eager
to get to your suite

64
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:24,129
where there may or may not be
a surprise waiting for you.

65
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:26,047
- A surprise?
- [Maurillio] Hmm.

66
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:28,300
I don't know. Let's find out.

67
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,761
- Hmm.
- Okay. [giggles]

68
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,180
[Maurillio] Now, Emily,
I want you to know something.

69
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:36,141
This man right here,
he loves you very, very much.

70
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,434
Yes, he does.

71
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,311
[giggles] But how do you know that?

72
00:03:39,394 --> 00:03:41,563
Let's just say I have a feeling.

73
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,440
[chuckles]

74
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,524
Ladies first.

75
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:48,278
So that you may be the first one
to see what awaits, if anything.

76
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,488
There could be nothing.

77
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:51,907
- What the fuck is your problem?
- What is it?

78
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,784
- What the fuck? You giving out clues.
- It's fine.

79
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:54,868
- It's not fine!
- It's fine.

80
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:55,952
- No, it's not!
- Come on.

[Latin pop music playing]

- Ah. We have finally arrived.
- Thank you.

83
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,462
- Ahhh.
- Okay.

84
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:09,549
<i>Señora,</i>
may you always remember this moment.

85
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,301
For the rest of your life.

86
00:04:11,968 --> 00:04:14,179
- Okay. [giggles]
- Ooh. We could take a picture of this.

87
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,018
["Lovely Day" playing]

88
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:22,354
Oh. [whimpers]

89
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:30,904
I cannot apologize enough.

90
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,031
It seems the guests
in the Presidential Suite

91
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:34,991
above your room overfilled the Jacuzzi.

92
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:37,327
So, that means you're gonna put us
in another room, right?

93
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,537
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

94
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,747
If there was room available,
it would be yours.

95
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,583
Sadly, the hotel is fully booked.

96
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,503
Why would you say "of course" if you
knew you didn't have another room?

97
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,838
You know how misleading that is?

98
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,215
Can you just check
with any of the other hotels nearby?

99
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:54,553
Of course. We have relationships with all
of the five-star hotels. No problem.

100
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:56,054
Just a second.

101
00:04:56,137 --> 00:04:57,347
Hmm.

102
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,559
Well, let me go ahead and also check
for four-star hotels.

103
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,229
Ah. You know, a lot of people have issues
with three-star hotels,

104
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:07,065
but they are just as good
as five-star hotels.

105
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,610
Yeah, after three,
it's, like, too much, you know?

106
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:12,612
[typing]

107
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:14,948
And there you have it.

108
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:19,244
One-star hotel with a great room
at the Airport Best Western.

109
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:20,662
Are you fucking kidding me?

110
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:23,707
Well, according to this, sir,
it is the best Western in the area.

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,543
Let me tell you something, okay?
I had an itinerary planned.

112
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:29,087
We was gonna go whale watching,
we was gonna go tequila tasting.

113
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,591
- I booked a dinner at sunset on the beach!
- [man] Maurillio!

114
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:34,175
- Where is that son of a bitch?
- [woman] Yes!

115
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,470
Maurillio! My <i>amigo.</i>

116
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,681
Thank you so much for
that Jet Ski hookup.

117
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,600
Man, we felt some killer waves
on the second break.

118
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:44,227
- Oh, my gosh. Then we got high as shit.
- We did.

119
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,813
So we literally had to jump off
and go body surfing.

120
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,899
Yeah, but we turned around
and the Jet Ski was gone.

121
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:53,028
But don't freak out because I actually
took a photo of exactly where we left it.

122
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,613
You are gonna have no problem finding it.

123
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,072
[man] She's the brains.

124
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:58,158
Okay, okay. Thank you, <i>señora.</i>

125
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,242
You're welcome. [giggles]

126
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,662
Excuse me, lady with the phone
in the goddamn sandwich bag.

127
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,080
Hi. How are you guys?

128
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,999
Were you guys having a conversation?

129
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:10,003
'Cause you assumed that Maurillio
wasn't already talking to somebody.

130
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,464
You just walk your happy ass in here
and cut me off.

131
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:14,799
Now, look. I don't mean to snap.
It's a lot going on right now.

132
00:06:14,883 --> 00:06:16,259
- I'm a little stressed out.
- It's okay.

133
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,219
I just wanna holler at him real quick.
Can I do that?

134
00:06:18,303 --> 00:06:19,763
- Yeah. You enjoy your day.
- Thank you.

135
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,264
Enjoy this gorgeous weather.

136
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,350
[laughs]

137
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:28,313
Maurillio. You do know how important
this trip is to us, man.

138
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,523
Yes, of course.
We want your proposal to be perfect.

139
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,818
- Proposal?
- Oh, shit.

140
00:06:33,902 --> 00:06:36,279
- [Emily] Baby.
- No, no. I will fix this.

141
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,822
Emily.

142
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,829
- I am sorry. I cannot fix it.
- Fuck you, Maurillio!

143
00:06:44,913 --> 00:06:45,956
That's fair.

144
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,042
Babe, come over here.
Let me talk to you.

145
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:52,379
- Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes.
- You guys have a good one. [giggles]

146
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,006
- Did she text you back?
- Nah, not yet.

147
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,925
I'm sorry this didn't go as I planned it.

148
00:06:58,927 --> 00:06:59,928
Look, um…

149
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:01,596
Oh, my God.

150
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,181
[Marcus] I might as well do it up.

151
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:04,474
Okay, I'm just try...

152
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,851
- My flow is all thrown off.
- It's okay. Just keep going.

153
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,311
Just please, just keep going.

154
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,396
[Marcus] Baby, um…

155
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,983
- Shut up!
- [Marcus] Look, you mean so much to me.

156
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,360
- Baby, I love you so much.
- [breathes shakily]

157
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:17,904
And I know today has been
all over the place…

158
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:19,072
[sighs]

159
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:20,532
…and I can be a bit of a control freak,

160
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:22,575
and when stuff ain't going my way,
I get all uptight,

161
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,452
- and I overthink things…
- Oh, baby.

162
00:07:24,536 --> 00:07:26,913
…but the one thing
I could never think twice about…

163
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,166
is how much I actually love you.

164
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,923
- Baby, will you marry me?
- [gasps]

165
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,719
Yes! [chuckles]

166
00:07:40,802 --> 00:07:42,971
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, my God.

167
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:45,765
- Yes! Yeah! Fucking A, Maurillio. Yes!
- Yes!

168
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,767
- [man] You had me! You were like…
- [woman] That was beautiful!

169
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,186
"The only thing
I didn't need to think about was you."

170
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,855
You guys! It was you.

171
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,524
It was... Baby, I love you!
I love you so much.

172
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,068
Baby, I love you so much. I love you.

173
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:59,487
And you know what,
I don't care that we lost the room.

174
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:01,990
I know. I know how hard you worked.
I don't care.

175
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:04,951
We can camp out on the beach.
I just wanna be your woman!

176
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,245
No! No! Nobody's camping on the beach.

177
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,664
- You get that out of your head right now.
- I love you guys.

178
00:08:09,748 --> 00:08:12,417
- Like, you have to stay with us.
- With us.

179
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,128
Consider it, like, our engagement present
to your beautiful souls.

180
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,046
Yes.

181
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,465
- Nah. Yeah. Yeah. We're okay.
- Nah, we good. Yeah. We're fine.

182
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,884
You're gonna say no
to the Presidential Suite?

183
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,969
It has a Jacuzzi and everything.

184
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,181
[Latin music playing]

185
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:32,562
I know we gave that tub a rough ride,
but what happened to craftsmanship, right?

186
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,980
- [footsteps approaching]
- Eh.

187
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,192
Okay. So I had them move your bags
to the master suite.

188
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:39,319
Oh, girl. That is way too much.

189
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:40,403
What? No, no, no.

190
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,655
Get yourselves comfortable.
You are our guests.

191
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:44,365
It is truly the least we can do

192
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:48,203
after our wonky 'cuzzi fucked up
your totally beautiful proposal.

193
00:08:48,286 --> 00:08:49,662
Well, look. Maybe…

194
00:08:51,247 --> 00:08:52,457
Maybe for tonight, okay?

195
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,917
- Until we get another hotel.
- Yes!

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,544
- Yes! Oh, boy!
- Settled. Who's thirsty?

197
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,004
Sit, sit, sit. Get comfortable.

198
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:01,841
Oh, if you guys are worried about privacy
and you wanna get really kinky tonight...

199
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:02,967
We're extremely loud.

200
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:06,888
I don't know what these walls are made
of, but you seriously can't hear anything!

201
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:08,515
Okay. Listen.

202
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:09,766
[door closes]

203
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,602
[woman screams]

204
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,895
[door opens]

205
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:18,483
You're not gonna believe this.
I just screamed in there.

206
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:23,029
- Uh…
- Yeah, we, um… we... we... we heard you.

207
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,531
Are you sure it was me?

208
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,449
- Yeah. Pretty certain.
- [phone rings]

209
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,577
Yo! Oh, no, we're fine.

210
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:32,247
Nah, it's just my gal screaming.
[sniffs] Yeah, you bet.

211
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:36,417
Hey, guys.
I don't mean to pry or anything,

212
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:39,879
but are you guys, like,
secret billionaires or something?

213
00:09:39,963 --> 00:09:42,215
- Why do you ask?
- 'Cause this place looks very expensive.

214
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,968
Oh, super expensive. We spent, like,
every penny we had on this place.

215
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,052
Yeah.

216
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,303
Wait. Why would you do that?

217
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,973
[man] My buddy Charlie came here
way back when and raved about it.

218
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,767
If we're gonna go on vacation,
might as well go all out, right?

219
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:54,477
And just go broke?

220
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,770
Oh, we'll make more money.

221
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:58,857
I work in a doctor's office.
Ron here is a park ranger.

222
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,192
And not to brag, we're pretty good.

223
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:04,028
Kyla and I always say
if we find ourselves with too much money,

224
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,989
we haven't been spending it fast enough.

225
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,532
That... That's one way to live.

226
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,534
You know, they say
money buys you freedom,

227
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:12,328
but how can you really be free if you're
thinking about making money all the time?

228
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,790
Well, I guess it's your welfare checks
I've been paying. [chuckles]

229
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:18,001
Possibly. Possibly, Marcus.

230
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,212
- [chuckling] Anyway, to the happy couple.
- [Kyla] To the happy, gorgeous couple!

231
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:22,797
- All right.
- [Kyla] Yeah, you're engaged!

232
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:23,756
[giggles]

233
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:25,633
- [slurping]
- Oh, that is good.

234
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:28,386
Ron makes the best margaritas,
and let me just tell you, girl.

235
00:10:28,469 --> 00:10:29,804
- Babe.
- It gets the job done.

236
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:30,805
[Ron] Indeed.

237
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:32,599
So, Ron. What park do you work at?

238
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:35,351
Oh. Oregon National Cave Monument.
It's in Oregon.

239
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,978
Whoa. You work in caves?

240
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:40,356
I'm like Batman. If Batman's job was
to keep kids from jacking off stalagmites.

241
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,357
[Kyla] Totally.

242
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,525
What about you guys?

243
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,402
Uh, we're from Chicago, actually.

244
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:47,530
I work in finance and Marcus owns
his own construction company.

245
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:51,659
Quick question.
Um, why does the salt not taste salty?

246
00:10:51,743 --> 00:10:53,620
- Oh, because it's cocaine.
- What?

247
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,664
- You drugged us?
- [Ron, Kyla] Yeah.

248
00:10:56,748 --> 00:10:59,500
I thought I made it really clear
when I said to her... I was like, you know,

249
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:01,461
- "It'll get the job done."
- "It gets the job done."

250
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:04,881
Get the job done? That's not clear.
That's very vague, okay?

251
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,509
What is wrong with you?
Why would you put cocaine in margaritas?

252
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,512
Because we're on vacation.

253
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:12,764
I don't do drugs.

254
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,684
- Even on vacation?
- No.

255
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,856
[both laughing]

256
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,399
- [Ron] He almost had me!
- [Kyla] Oh, my God.

257
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,944
- He almost... [laughs]
- It's so good!

258
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:28,947
- You! Oh, man! This is... This guy!
- Oh, my God. I just...

259
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,573
It would have been nice
if you would've told us

260
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,408
that you was gonna put cocaine
in our drink.

261
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,868
Where'd you get the coke from, anyway?

262
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:36,829
We actually brought it from home.
Very, very easy if you ever wanna try it.

263
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,665
It's just a Ziploc
in a full shampoo bottle.

264
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,959
The scanners can't see it,
dogs can't smell it,

265
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,544
and it's so much more comfortable
than when I had it in my ass.

266
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:44,629
You guys want nibbles?

267
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:46,089
- Mmm.
- [cell phone vibrates]

268
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,298
Oh.

269
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:48,383
Wait a minute.

270
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:49,968
[sighs] What now, baby?

271
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,137
Whale watching. I forgot
I booked a whale watching tour at 4:30.

272
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:54,514
What? You guys just got here.

273
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:56,307
Marcus likes to plan.

274
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,893
You know what? Good for you.

275
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:01,688
'Cause without a plan,
the world falls apart.

276
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:03,398
I mean, garbage doesn't get collected.

277
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:06,192
Water slides don't get built.
Planes fall from the sky.

278
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:08,361
Planning makes the world work.

279
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:12,699
Yeah, it's just, uh… just whale watching.

280
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:15,034
Wait. I have an idea.
We were actually gonna go to the water.

281
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,954
We can walk you guys down, all chat and
get to know each other a little bit more.

282
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,081
- What do you say?
- All right. Let's go get changed.

283
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,249
[Kyla] Yay!

284
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,251
I love your whole everything, by the way.

285
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:25,712
- [man chanting]
- [baby crying]

286
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,965
They said this was exclusive.

287
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:33,094
"An exclusive, luxury experience."
That's what the website said.

288
00:12:33,177 --> 00:12:34,846
This is really gonna bum out the whales.

289
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,431
[Kyla] Baby, this is so gross.

290
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:38,891
I won't be able to sleep at night
if I know they've gone on this boat.

291
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,144
You guys,
you should just come with us in our boat.

292
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,563
- [Ron] That's a great idea.
- Wait a minute. That boat is yours?

293
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,482
As long as we're staying here it is.
We rented it. What do you say? Our treat.

294
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:49,694
- I mean, I'm down if you're down.
- [Kyla gasps]

295
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,154
- Yay!
- [chuckling] Oh.

296
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,613
[laughs] Could you give us a second?

297
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:55,033
- Gonna talk to my lady really quick.
- No problem. Not a problem.

298
00:12:55,116 --> 00:12:56,242
- Be right back.
- See you in a bit.

299
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:57,493
- Baby.
- Yeah, babe?

300
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,913
How is someone already throwing up?

301
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,624
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is not weird to you?

302
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,084
- I mean...
- Don't look. They're not weird?

303
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:09,380
They're the only people I've ever heard of

- I don't know, baby. Screw it.
- What?

Can we for once, just in our lives,

306
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:19,015
just say "screw it" to all the plans
and just get on a damn boat?

- Yeah.

Okay, man. Where did you learn
to sail a boat like this?

322
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,387
[Ron] I did cleanup work
off Malaysia one summer.

What type of skill set do you gotta have
just to predict when a bird gonna shit?

329
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,864
It's weird, but it's impressive.

330

I'll take it.

No. [laughs]

an assistant to Dr. Adolphus.

- Interesting name.
- I know, right?

335

He's had to change it, like,
a million times

336

because the Feds are always after him.

The benefits are really worth it.

I don't drive boats. I don't sail.

'Cause I'm not driving.

00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,761
Okay? He's completely
crazy. He has a gun.

459
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,179
- A gun?
- Yeah. Shh.

460
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,599
He's... He's made me live in a basement.
He's made me eat cat food.

461
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,560
And he makes me go to the bathroom
in a little lawn chair with a hole in it.

462
00:20:19,643 --> 00:20:22,062
- What the hell? Why?
- I need to find a way to get his gun.

463
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,898
- We can't...
- We're not safe!

464
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:25,983
- What the hell?
- [laughs]

465
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,068
- I got you.
- You were really jok... You're such...

466
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,987
- You're the worst.
- I just got you.

467
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,114
- [Emily] That was not funny.
- [Kyla] It was really funny.

468
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,450
- I can't believe you…
- Nah, man, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.

469
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,745
No, you know what?
Fuck it. Come on. Give it to me.

470
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,163
We're having a good time.

471
00:20:40,664 --> 00:20:42,583
[chuckling]

472
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,335
Yeah. [chuckles]

473
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,670
[sighs]

474
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:50,591
You know, when we first saw y'all
on this trip, we thought y'all was crazy.

475
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:54,678
I mean, I was right.
I mean, y'all are, like, fucking nuts.

476
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:57,014
- [chuckles]
- But... But in a good way, man.

477
00:20:58,098 --> 00:20:59,350
I'm glad I met you, Ron.

478
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:01,977
Like for real.

479
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,481
Put that thing away.

480
00:21:06,273 --> 00:21:08,484
Put what away? What are we doing?

481
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:11,195
<i>Salaam.</i>

482
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,909
A kiss on the forehead is
the ultimate sign of respect.

483
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,494
I learned that from a sheikh in Kuwait.

484
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,746
A forehead kiss is really intimate.
You know that, right?

485
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,039
Like, I almost proposed to you.

486
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:24,500
- [laughs]
- [chuckles]

487
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:27,503
- Nice.
- Mmm.

488
00:21:28,212 --> 00:21:30,798
- Where should I get rid of this then?
- I'll show you.

489
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:34,093
Hey, ladies. Come here. Check this out.

490
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:38,681
- Oh, shit, man. What the fuck?
- Oh, my God. He really does have a gun.

491
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,767
Yeah, babe. I wouldn't lie about that.

492
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:44,562
It's a gift from my buddy Charlie.
I take it everywhere.

493
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:46,814
Man,
you scared the shit out of me with that.

494
00:21:46,897 --> 00:21:47,898
What does this mean?

495
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:49,733
[Ron] <i>De oppresso liber.</i>

496
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,820
It's a phrase that has special meaning
to people such as myself, Marcus.

497
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,989
A reminder
that a powerful weapon like this

498
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,199
should only be used
when absolutely necessary.

499
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,705
Now, put that bottle on your head.
I'm gonna shoot it off.

500
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,082
- Yes! [grunts]
- Whoo!

501
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:08,252
No. Hold on one second. Hold on a
second. Guys, no. Seriously, stop playing.

502
00:22:08,335 --> 00:22:10,337
It's fine.
We play this game at home all the time.

503
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,631
Babe, he's not serious.
We been drinking and we been smoking.

504
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:14,717
- I don't... No, no, no.
- [screams]

505
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,885
Count it!

506
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:19,430
What the fuck?

507
00:22:19,513 --> 00:22:20,681
You hit the bottle this time!

508
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,100
- [laughs]
- Oh, my God.

509
00:22:23,684 --> 00:22:26,687
[laughing hysterically]

510
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,024
[chuckles] Yes!

511
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:33,611
[both laughing]

512
00:22:33,694 --> 00:22:35,237
Oh, my God!

513
00:22:35,738 --> 00:22:37,448
- Do me!
- Whoa, wait, what?

514
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:38,532
Yeah. Your turn, go.

515
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:41,619
[laughs]

516
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:44,079
[Marcus] Hey, man, you sure you okay?

517
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,499
[Ron] The bullet just grazed me. I'm not
gonna let a little scratch ruin my night.

518
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,377
I mean, look at the four of us.
This is magical, isn't it?

519
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:51,503
Mmm.

520
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,339
You know what's crazy, you guys?

521
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:58,427
Ron and I are the only two people on the
planet that know that y'all are engaged.

522
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,304
Ah, I wish it could stay that way.

523
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,139
I mean, to be honest,

524
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,767
there's a lot of people
that really wouldn't be happy for us.

525
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,851
[together] What?

526
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,312
- Who?
- Look, her dad hates me, y'all. For real.

527
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,522
- [Emily] Okay, not hates.
- What?

528
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:13,734
He just don't think I'm good enough
to marry his perfect-ass daughter.

529
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:15,861
- [Emily] Perfect da... Who? Me?
- [Marcus] Yes, you.

530
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,197
Okay, listen, no.
My dad's a little tough, yes.

531
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,575
I mean, he is the dean
of Emory Business School,

532
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:23,452
so he's a little traditional.

533
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,829
I literally don't understand
what you're saying right now.

534
00:23:25,913 --> 00:23:27,456
This is Marcus we're talking about!

535
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,169
I know. It's insane! How could anyone
not, like, absolutely love you?

536
00:23:32,252 --> 00:23:33,087
You're the best.

537
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,672
[Marcus] Her father holds
all these things against me.

538
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:36,215
Like, number one, you know,

539
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,176
he looks down on me because
I had a failed marriage before, right?

540
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,220
Things don't work out. It is what it is.

541
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:44,640
Number two, he treats me like
I'm some regular construction worker.

542
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,434
I own my own construction company.
I'm my own boss.

543
00:23:47,518 --> 00:23:48,852
This doesn't seem justified.

544
00:23:48,936 --> 00:23:50,813
Yeah, but strike three, I'ma be honest.

545
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,107
I did punch her brother in the face
at her mama's birthday party.

546
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,191
- Got it.
- There's that.

547
00:23:54,274 --> 00:23:57,027
Well, my dad never got to meet Ron.

548
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:58,404
Oh, no!

549
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,655
Sorry, did he die?

550
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,782
No. San Quentin's just so far.

551
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:04,618
I got it. Wait, I got it.
I got it. I freaking got it.

552
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:06,537
- What?
- Do it tonight.

553
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,830
- [Kyla gasps]
- Wait. Do what tonight?

554
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,082
- Get married tonight! Here!
- Get married! Tonight!

555
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:11,583
Yes! Right! Tonight, you guys!

556
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,335
Wait, why would we do that?

557
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,962
[Ron] You said
your family wouldn't approve.

558
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,339
You'll be surrounded by friends
that love and support you.

559
00:24:17,423 --> 00:24:19,091
- Yeah. [chuckles]
- Friends!

560
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:20,342
It's a wedding just for you guys.

561
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,845
[Ron] Come on. I know the perfect guy.

562
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,931
[chanting in Mayan]

563
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,185
Baby. Baby,
do you think this is legally binding?

564
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,397
Somehow I don't think so.
But just go with it.

565
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,065
[whispering] You did good, babe.

566
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,401
We did good.

567
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:39,069
[speaks Mayan]

568
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:41,113
He's asking if you brought your <i>suku'un.</i>

569
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:42,114
Wh-What's that?

570
00:24:42,197 --> 00:24:44,199
In Mayan ritual,
<i>suku'un</i> is like your brother.

571
00:24:45,075 --> 00:24:47,828
- Like a spiritual best man.
- Mm-hmm.

572
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,374
Well, I guess you my <i>s... su-suk...
suku'un?</i> Is that how you say it?

573
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:56,086
Marcus.
You don't say that if you don't mean it.

574
00:24:56,837 --> 00:24:58,547
I-I-I do mean it.

575
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:02,051
And, uh, you don't have to be
so intense about it. Just chill out.

576
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,261
[gasps] Wow!

577
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:07,139
[Kyla sighs]

578
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,895
[chanting continues]

579
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,730
[whispering] I have goose bumps.

[cell phone chimes]

582
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:37,002
Well, looks like you fuckers are married!

583
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,588
[Ron laughs] Yes! Congratulations!

584
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,049
- We did it! You love me!
- We love you guys!

585
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:43,842
- I love you.
- We love you guys!

586
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:45,928
Hey. Yo, yo. [speaks Mayan]

587
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,262
Picture, picture, picture.

588
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,139
- [laughs]
- [cheers]

589
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:52,601
- Yes! Yes! Congratulations!
- Whoo!

590
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,852
[Emily] We did it!

591
00:25:53,936 --> 00:25:55,270
[Kyla] Congrats, you guys!

592
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:02,111
[Kyla] Ah! Oh, my God. Whoo!

593
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,612
Oh, it's so pretty.

594
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:06,156
Listen up, world.

595
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,160
Allow me to introduce to you,
for the first time in sacred matrimony,

596
00:26:10,244 --> 00:26:11,954
Marcus and Emily Parker!

597
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,122
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

598
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:17,793
May this be the worst day
of the rest of your fucking life!

599
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:19,503
What?

600
00:26:20,003 --> 00:26:21,213
Think about it.

601
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,466
[panting]

602
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,219
Whoa. Wha... What are you doin'?

603
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:29,138
Covering my balls.

604
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,180
[laughing] This guy.

605
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:37,187
You know what, Marcus?
You're right. It's time to live.

606
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:38,605
- [Emily] What?
- [Ron grunts]

607
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:39,857
Whoo!

608
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,899

He's alive.

What?

00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:52,703
[Ron] That was incredible!
But, Marcus, do cover your balls!

613
00:26:53,328 --> 00:26:55,539
- I'll do it if you do it.
- Oh, girl, hell no!

614
00:26:55,622 --> 00:26:56,665
[Kyla shrieks]

616
00:27:00,169 --> 00:27:01,170
Fuck it.

[laughing]

622
00:27:12,306 --> 00:27:14,641
I'm not doing that shit. [chuckles]

623
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:19,229
You know something?

624
00:27:19,313 --> 00:27:20,397
[clattering]

625
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:23,400
[sighs] I am gonna do that shit.

[yodeling continues]

627
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:30,824
Whoa!

628
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:33,827

- [Ron] That was awesome!
- [Kyla] Oh, my God. Oh, God!

631
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:46,131
You guys, let's live here forever!

632
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,217
- Whoo!
- [Marcus laughs] What are you...

633
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:51,428
[laughing] He's using a corkscrew
on a regular bottle.

634
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:55,182
That's not a wine bottle, man.
That's not even a cork!

635
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:56,725
- [laughs]
- Whoa!

636
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,268
My big, sweet dum-dum.

637
00:27:58,352 --> 00:27:59,603
- [Emily] Yeah, true!
- [Marcus] Yep.

638
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:00,812
[Kyla] Yeah! Yeah!

639
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,314
- [Ron] My dick needs some face time!
- [Kyla] Good.

640
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:03,398
The room is spinning.

641
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,566
Whoo!

642
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,903
[Ron screams] I feel invincible!

- [Latin pop music playing]
- [Kyla] Whoo! Yeah!

644
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:24,711
Yeah.

645
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,641
You're my husband now.

646
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,063
[Ron] Marcus, look.

647
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:45,023
That bird's about to shit.

648
00:28:50,237 --> 00:28:51,822
[Kyla moaning] You're so bad.

649
00:28:52,906 --> 00:28:54,658
[laughs]

650
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,952
Hey... What...

651
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:02,040
[Kyla] Shh.

652
00:29:04,418 --> 00:29:05,836

[whispering] Oh, man.

657
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,564
Emily! Ow.

658
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:32,237
We gonna miss our flight.
We gotta get to the airport! Emily?

659
00:29:33,322 --> 00:29:34,531
What? God.

660
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,992
Make it stop.

661
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:41,330
Okay, baby. B8, it's right over there.

662
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,247
You good?

663
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:43,165
I don't know.

664
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,709
- Okay. We're so close.
- [man on PA, indistinct]

[pants, sighs]

666
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,420
[Ron] Hey! Stop that couple!

667
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,005
[Kyla] I think they have a bomb!

668
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,132
[both laughing]

669
00:29:52,215 --> 00:29:53,425
What... No. No, no, no.

670
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:57,179
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

671
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,098
What is wrong with y'all?
Are you crazy? We in an airport!

672
00:30:00,182 --> 00:30:03,560
No, I will not mule your illegal drugs
in my anus!

673
00:30:03,643 --> 00:30:04,644
- [laughs]
- What?

674
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:07,064
Look around. Nobody cares.

675
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:10,442
And you guys were so cute and peaceful
this morning. We didn't wanna wake you up.

676
00:30:10,525 --> 00:30:11,860
Hair of the dog?

677
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,862
Oh, I can't even look at another drink.

678
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:16,782
Sit. Come on. We got shrimp nachos
coming. Leave the heads on down here.

679
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:18,909
- Oh, God.
- Come on. Sit, please.

680
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:20,077
[Marcus] Okay, you know something?

681
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,454
- We gonna just head to the gate.
- We gonna go. Yeah.

682
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,539
- No! Whoa, whoa.
- No, no, no. Whoa, whoa.

683
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:28,085
Guys. We gotta do this again. The four
of us are too good together not to!

684
00:30:28,168 --> 00:30:31,630
Yes! Oh, my God. You guys should come
out for the Oregon State Fair next month!

685
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:35,509
Yeah! It's in Oregon. We go every year.
Last year, we took a double dose of DMT.

686
00:30:35,592 --> 00:30:37,636
Yeah, don't worry. It's all natural.

687
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,138
It's just the chemical your brain releases
when you die.

688
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:41,848
- [Marcus] Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

689
00:30:41,932 --> 00:30:42,849
Sounds fun.

690
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:44,434
Great. Give us your number.

691
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,647
Oh, wait... Baby, you go...
You got my phone?

692
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,148
[Marcus] 'Cause I didn't...

693
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:51,066
Your phone broke.

694
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,651
- Her phone broke and then my...
- Oh, my God.

695
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:55,320
I had a phone, but we'll take
your information. How about that?

696
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,030
- Oh, my God. Yes! Yes.
- Yeah! Of course.

697
00:30:57,114 --> 00:30:58,365
- Baby. Give them your card.
- I got one.

698
00:30:58,448 --> 00:30:59,991
He has very fancy business cards.

699
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,201
- [Ron] Yeah. There you go!
- [Emily] Wow.

700
00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:03,453
So, when you call that,
that's gonna ring in the ranger's station.

701
00:31:03,537 --> 00:31:05,038
Then somebody comes to get me
outta the cave.

702
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:07,374
Oh, before I forget,
let me give your sunglasses back.

703
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,792
No, man. Keep 'em.

704
00:31:09,918 --> 00:31:11,628
Why you want me to keep 'em?
They're yours.

705
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,963
No, they're ours.

706
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,256
[shaman chanting]

707
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,884
You guys are in our lives now.
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

708
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:19,261
[Marcus] Yeah. You know...

709
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,930
It would be nice if, you know,
you keep what...

710
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,475
what happened here… here.

711
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,560
Marcus,

712
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:29,646
if you're worried about the catamaran,
don't worry about it. I got you, dude.

713
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:32,482
Care about the boat? I'm talking about
everything... I'm talkin' about all of it.

714
00:31:32,566 --> 00:31:34,985
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna remember this week forever.

715
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:36,153
[Marcus] What? Oh.

716
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:40,907
It's been so special.
I love, love, love, love, love, love you.

717
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,664
- Bring it in.
- Oh. Mmm.

718
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:49,082
Get in here.

719
00:31:49,791 --> 00:31:52,294
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [Kyla] Oh.

720
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,964
Marcus. Thank you so much
for being so cool about everything.

721
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,550
About what?

722
00:31:59,092 --> 00:32:00,302
Last night.

723
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,725
Marcus, it was life-changing.

724
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:12,856
Okay. Baby, we should go. [chuckles]
Farewell. Take care.

725
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,399
- [Kyla] Oh, no.
- Let's go.

726
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,193
- [chuckles]
- See you guys later.

727
00:32:16,276 --> 00:32:18,904
- [Kyla] We love you guys.
- Hey, somebody stop those two!

728
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,240
I think I see some human trafficking!
[chuckles]

729
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:25,410
Hey. Why did you say see you later?
That leaves the door open.

730
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:27,704
I don't know. I was trying to be vague.

731
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,665
And who says "farewell"?
What are you? Othello?

732
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:33,084
Farewell sounds final, okay?

733
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,086
I don't wanna see those freaks again.
Do you?

734
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,963
I don't know. They were kinda fun.

735
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:39,257
Yes, on vacation. Not in the real world.

736
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:41,885
But they did loosen us up a little bit.

737
00:32:41,968 --> 00:32:44,721
Yes,
they may have loosened us up a little bit,

738
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:46,264
but speaking of gettin' loose.

739
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,309
Do you remember anything
that happened last night?

740
00:32:51,645 --> 00:32:54,773
Mm-mmm.
After the ceremony, it was all a blur.

741
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,901
But... But was it
that type of blur that, um...

742
00:32:57,984 --> 00:33:01,238
That some moments are, like...
like, insanely clear?

743
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,614
[Emily] Hmm.

744
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,200
You know, now that you mention it.

745
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:09,204
No, all a blur.

746
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:15,335
Oh. Well, it was a...
It's all a blur for me too. [chuckles]

747
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:17,629
There's nothing clearly I remember at all.

748
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:18,964
[chuckles]

749
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:20,215
'Cause I'm asking you.

750
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:23,927
Maybe it's for the best.
You got your ticket out? We're boarding.

751
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:31,601
[woman on PA, indistinct]

752
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,567
- [whirring]
- [truck beeping]

753
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:42,737
Now, look. Whenever we off-load
materials on the site,

754
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,198
what we do is, we log on here
and put it on this spreadsheet.

755
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:47,158
This is the way we keep tabs
with the inventory.

756
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,869
Yeah, but why can't we just write it
in the book like we used to?

757
00:33:49,953 --> 00:33:52,872
The problem is, I can't log on to a book
when I'm in Atlanta, right?

758
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:55,542
I need to be on the cloud
so I can see what you clowns are doing.

759
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,210
It's almost like you don't trust us.

760
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,754
It's almost like
I don't trust y'all anymore? [chuckles]

761
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,048
Guess what?
I do trust y'all, to screw shit up.

762
00:34:02,132 --> 00:34:03,717
That's why I'm only gone for a week.

763
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,677
Oh, I can fuck a lot of shit up in a week.

764
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,220
I 100% believe that. You s...

765
00:34:07,304 --> 00:34:09,598
Yo, Marcus.
Fred and Enzo are fighting again.

766
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,224
What? [groans] Damn it.

767
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:14,561
- Let's go. Hands up. Let's go.
- You think I'm scared of you, bro?

768
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:17,731
I ain't scared of you. Think I'm playing
with you? I ain't playing with you.

769
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:18,648
Cut it out!

770
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:20,650
Stop it! Okay, what is this all about?

771
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:21,776
He's trying to steal my shit.

772
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,403
Fuck you. I had this crane booked.

773
00:34:23,486 --> 00:34:25,113
You should have logged it
in the spreadsheet.

774
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,240
You just learned
about spreadsheets, okay? Chill.

775
00:34:27,324 --> 00:34:30,201
Why y'all arguing about a damn crane?
One of y'all could use the sidelifter.

776
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:31,286
This one's special.

777
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:35,332
[Marcus] What you mean this one is...

778
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:37,083
[laughing]

779
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,835
You gotta be kiddin' me. Come on, now.

780
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,337
It's a Hugo Boss.

781
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,049
We were thinking Vera Wang, but decided
this one's better for your build.

782
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,050
Hey, man.

783
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:46,468
Wow, look at this.

784
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:47,886
Yo, this is dope, man.

785
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:50,764
Like, honestly, thank y'all.
I really appreciate this.

786
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:53,516
And look, y'all... Y'all do understand why
you can't come to the wedding, right?

787
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,852
Yeah. You're embarrassed by us.

788
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:58,605
- No. Have you met her parents?
- No, because you won't let us.

789
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,190
Okay, look, if it was up to me,

790
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:03,068
I would invite every last one of y'all
to the wedding, but I can't.

791
00:35:03,151 --> 00:35:04,778
Her parents said
they just want family there.

792
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:06,404
They want it to be really intimate.

793
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:09,532
[big band music playing]

794
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:11,076
[Marcus] Baby, what is this?

795
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,244
What happened to intimate?
Who's all these people?

796
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:17,457
As far as I'm concerned,
we got married in a Mexican cave.

797
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:19,668
So if you wanna bail, I'm down.

798
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,795
Really? We can... We can do that?

799
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,546
Mm-mmm. No, we can't.

800
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,591
[music ends]

801
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:28,718
[chattering]

802
00:35:28,802 --> 00:35:31,096
Oh, there they are.

803
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:34,557
Marcus,
I am so glad that you're finally here.

804
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,017
Hey. Good seeing you too. [chuckles]

805
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:39,396
And look at my girl. [chuckles] Oh.

806
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:41,815
Please tell me
that you brought the dress I sent you.

807
00:35:41,898 --> 00:35:44,567
You only texted me about it
a million times. Yes, Mom, I did.

808
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:45,527
- Oh, good.
- [Emily] Yes.

809
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,489
Well, I want you all to remember
that this weekend is all about you.

810
00:35:49,572 --> 00:35:52,200
So I want you to have fun.

811
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,743
Enjoy yourselves.

812
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:56,454
Just remember to work the room
while everyone's here

813
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:58,415
starting with Grandma Phyllis.

814
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:01,418
[footsteps departing]

815
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:06,256
Baby, is she sleeping with her eyes open?

816
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:08,216
[Emily] Grandma.

817
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:09,801
Grandma.

818
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,845
- [whispering] Grandma.
- [wheezes]

819
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:15,306
Oh, Emily. Is that you?

820
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,683
Yeah, Grandma.

821
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:18,101
Marcus, say hi.

822
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:20,520
[loudly] Hi.

823
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,606
Okay. Hey, Grandma,
why don't I go get you some tea?

824
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:25,817
I'm... I'm her fiancé, Marcus.

825
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,318
[Emily] She's not deaf, Marcus.

826
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:30,196
She didn't wake up.
You said her name five times. I don't...

827
00:36:31,781 --> 00:36:33,992
- [woman] Hey, girl.
- [man] Oh, my princess.

828
00:36:34,075 --> 00:36:35,785
- Oh.
- Hey.

829
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:37,162
- [man] How are you?
- [Emily] I'm good.

830
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:38,246
[man] Okay, okay.

831
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,670
Marcus.

832
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:50,925
Meet my colleagues.

833
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:53,803
This is Albert Kim.
He's chair of our Public Policy program.

834
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:57,515
And this is Dr. Gloria Alvarez.
She's head of Business Law.

835
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:02,479
And this is, uh, Marcus.
He's a construction worker.

836
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:04,522
It's nice to meet you.

837
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,153
Well, Marcus, uh…
welcome to your wedding.

838
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,822
Thanks for putting everything together.
I really appreciate this.

839
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:14,574
I just sign the checks.

840
00:37:14,657 --> 00:37:16,159
[chuckles]

841
00:37:16,242 --> 00:37:20,038
[sighs] Well,
I suppose I put this off long enough.

842
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:26,252
Now, these rings were passed on to me
by my grandparents,

843
00:37:26,336 --> 00:37:31,132
so forgive me for being just
a little uneasy handing them over to…

844
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:33,676
[sighs]

845
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,345
…well, you.

846
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,473
[Marcus] Wow, this, um...

847
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,058
This actually means a lot.

848
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,769
And you can trust me.
I promise you, I'll take care of these.

849
00:37:42,852 --> 00:37:46,439
I hope so. Those represent a commitment
to my daughter.

850
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:50,026
And I hope you take this far more
seriously than you did your last marriage.

851
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,946
What makes you think I didn't take
my last marriage seriously?

852
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:54,948
Damn, son. This some fancy shit.

853
00:37:55,031 --> 00:37:58,785
You done come a long way from drinkin' 40s
on the stoop with little Jay and Reggie.

854
00:37:58,868 --> 00:38:01,496
- Oh, stop. [laughs]
- Hey.

855
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,708
Ooh, I'm so glad to be out that car.
Your father farting the whole way.

856
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,211
[father]
You know I got the diverticulitis.

857
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:11,965
Anyway, good to see you, Harry.
We brought you a little something.

858
00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:13,091
Oh, thank you.

859
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:17,262
Yeah, that's not the regular Hennessy.
That's VSOP, $71.

860
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:18,680
[mother] Yeah, that was a set.

861
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,265
It came with two glasses,

862
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:23,726
but we kept those 'cause we thought
you had glasses. [laughs]

863
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,522
I think I see the councilman.
I should go say hello.

864
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,690
- Oh. Yeah.
- I like that jacket.

865
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:29,607
Yeah.

866
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,526
And tell the councilman I say hi too.

867
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:32,986
[laughing]

868
00:38:33,862 --> 00:38:35,905
Hey! Look, look.
Can y'all class it up a little bit?

869
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,282
- I told you...
- What's your problem?

870
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:39,409
We're just two men
having a conversation about cognac.

871
00:38:39,492 --> 00:38:41,661
No, I told you to put
the two glasses in there.

872
00:38:41,744 --> 00:38:42,954
- No.
- Hey.

873
00:38:43,037 --> 00:38:44,956
Look here. It's not about the glasses.

874
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,251
You talked about farting.
Nobody care about Dad's gas like that.

875
00:38:48,334 --> 00:38:50,670
And, Dad, you can't tell nobody
how much you spent on the gift.

876
00:38:50,753 --> 00:38:52,380
What's the point in spending
so much money then?

877
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:55,341
- How about this. Go... Go get some food.
- [mother] Mmm.

878
00:38:55,425 --> 00:38:57,844
It is so much food over there.
Y'all should go eat.

879
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,470
- Well, let me just say this.
- Uh-oh.

880
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:04,100
We will not talk to anyone else this
entire weekend if that's what you want.

881
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:05,935
If that's what you want.
I'm not gonna embarrass you.

882
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:07,395
- Ma, no.
- [father] See what you gone done?

883
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,231
Believe me. We're not hungry.
We not gonna eat any of your food.

884
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,692
- Ma. I know y'all hungry.
- You done messed up, boy.

885
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:15,153
- Dad... Could you talk to her for me?
- No, sir.

886
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:16,237
Ma... Ma.

887
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,572
[jazz music playing]

888
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,199
[chattering]

889
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:22,076
- …not us.
- [laughs]

890
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,704
- [sighs] You ready? Here we go.
- [man] Ladies and gentlemen,

891
00:39:24,787 --> 00:39:31,294
may I please present to you the bride
and groom-to-be, Emily and Marcus!

892
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:33,713
[applause, cheering]

893
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,216
- Oh, good. Aw.
- You…

894
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,387
How you doing?
Could I get a double scotch, please?

895
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:43,222
- Of course.
- Hope you didn't order the punch.

896
00:39:43,306 --> 00:39:45,934
Get it? 'Cause you punched me.

897
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:50,438
[chuckles]

898
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,523
Brother-in-law. Hey, Gabe.

899
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:54,943
Hey. You see this?

900
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:58,905
Just know that this thing right here
could kill you in 32 different ways,

901
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,240
and there's not a goddamn thing
you could do about it.

902
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:04,577
Okay, man. What you... What?
You been working out or somethin'?

903
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,495
Nope.

904
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:08,081
Yes. A little...

905
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:09,165
Whatever. Listen.

906
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:12,043
Just know that if you come at me
with another sucker punch,

907
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:13,544
I'ma be ready for it this time.

908
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,755
Gabe… [chuckles]
…I didn't sucker punch you.

909
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:18,299
You was acting like a crazy person
over a flag football game.

910
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,217
Yeah. Right.

911
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,804
You came in my face,
and you kept saying, "Punch me."

912
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,431
- Yeah, because I didn't think you'd do it.
- Well, I did it, okay?

913
00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:29,894
And I'm sorry. I've apologized to you
a thousand times. Can't we just move on?

914
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,646
- Put the past in the past, right?
- Yes.

915
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:32,981
- Forget it.
- Forget about it.

916
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:35,858
Yeah. Just... Oh, but just in case
you get any ideas, I brought a friend.

917
00:40:35,942 --> 00:40:38,236
He owns a dojo where I train.
His name's Bennett.

918
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,405
Bennett! Come here. Meet this guy.

919
00:40:40,488 --> 00:40:44,367
Oh, shit. There he is.

920
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,452
- Marcus.
- Nice to meet you.

921
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,288
- [Gabe] Yeah.
- Why's he here?

922
00:40:49,372 --> 00:40:52,333
Some people like to have friends
at life-changing events.

923
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:53,876
- That's it.
- That's it.

924
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,504
You would know if you had any friends.

925
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:59,298
If you did, my mom and dad wouldn't
have forced me to be your best man.

926
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:01,009
First of all, I don't like you.

927
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:03,511
And I don't want you to be my best man
anyway, all right?

928
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,431
I have great friends...
I have amazing friends, all right?

929
00:41:06,514 --> 00:41:08,641
You can't even handle any
of my friends. Okay?

930
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:14,022
[guests scream, gasp]

931
00:41:14,105 --> 00:41:15,273
[murmuring]

932
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:16,733
What the hell is that?

933
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,654
[shaman chanting]

934
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:24,782
Oh, uh…

935
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:30,788
Don't be alarmed...

936
00:41:30,872 --> 00:41:32,206
- Hey.
- Hi, yeah! Just a thing.

937
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,168
You son of a bitch!
You said we were best friends.

938
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:39,088
[Kyla] Yeah, the hell? You assholes. How
could you not invite us to your wedding?

939
00:41:39,172 --> 00:41:40,590
That's, like, fucked up!

940
00:41:42,925 --> 00:41:44,719
[both laughing]

941
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:47,722
- [Kyla] Oh, my God! You look amazing.
- [Ron] Good to see you, man.

942
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,975
- You look so gorgeous. Are you so excited?
- You been working out? Look at you.

943
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:53,227
- I mean... And you. You look…
- [Kyla] Oh, my sweetheart!

944
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:57,106
You guys smell the same. You smell
the same. Oh! I wanna kiss you!

945
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,649
What's... What's... What's goin' on here?

946
00:41:58,733 --> 00:42:00,234
- [chuckles]
- Oh, uh…

947
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,111
- We lost the brakes around Marietta.
- Yeah.

948
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:04,489
E-brake did the yeoman's work till
right about now.

949
00:42:04,572 --> 00:42:06,866
Yo, chief!
Just in case you need to move it.

950
00:42:06,949 --> 00:42:08,826
- [Kyla] Thank you.
- [chuckles]

951
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,915
So, I think what Marcus is trying to ask
is what... What are you two doing here?

952
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:18,086
Oh! Well, you guys, we were so confused
why you didn't call after <i>México.</i>

953
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,170
I mean, come on.

954
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:22,548
We were literally sitting by the phone
for a week being like, "What?" [chuckles]

955
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:26,052
But it was my bad.
'Cause the card I gave you. Old card.

956
00:42:26,135 --> 00:42:28,554
- You had no way to call.
- [Kyla] We did a little Internet stalking.

957
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:32,391
Then we found out you guys were registered
at Williams-Sonoma in beautiful Atlanta.

958
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:33,476
From there, it was easy.

959
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,686
Hit every wedding in Atlanta,
starting with downtown,

960
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,355
working our way out in concentric circles.

961
00:42:37,438 --> 00:42:40,733
Classic circle sweep maneuver. Same
thing I use to find lost kids in the cave.

962
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:42,527
This time you weren't too late, sweetie.

963
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:45,196
Hey, man. Get me up to speed.
What do you need from your best man?

964
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,239
[Kyla] Yay!

965
00:42:46,322 --> 00:42:47,490
Best... Best man?

966
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:50,493
Yeah. I mean, remember the shaman?

967
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,161
I'm your <i>suku'un.</i>

968
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,081
Ah!

969
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:57,083
I do remember that, and, you know,

970
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,168
and I couldn't...

971
00:42:59,252 --> 00:43:00,586
Because we couldn't reach you.

972
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,963
[Marcus] We couldn't reach you.
I couldn't call you.

973
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,923
- We were trying, but I was like…
- We were try... We tried.

974
00:43:04,006 --> 00:43:06,259
… "If you'd like to make a call…"
Like, I'm trying to!

975
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:08,594
- Wow, okay.
- So I had to get another best man.

976
00:43:08,678 --> 00:43:09,595
- [sighs] Yeah.
- Sorry.

977
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,514
- What?
- What?

978
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:13,015
- Who?
- My brother.

979
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,267
- Yeah.
- Her... her brother.

980
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:16,519
They are practically best friends.
Like, he loves him.

981
00:43:16,602 --> 00:43:19,230
And, you know,
we decided to do family-style.

982
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:21,232
- Family. Keep it in the fam. [chuckles]
- [Emily] Mm-hmm. So…

983
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:25,736
Two <i>suku'uns.</i>
I'll consult the sacred text. [mumbles]

984
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,363
- Okay, look. Look, I get it, right?
- [Emily sighs]

985
00:43:27,446 --> 00:43:30,449
You guys came all the way here,
and, you know, it took a long trip,

986
00:43:30,533 --> 00:43:33,536
and you... you drove through a gate,
which is crazy, right?

987
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,581
'Cause who gonna pay for that? Who?
'Cause that's not in the insurance.

988
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:39,458
But that's besides the point.
The wedding is all full, man.

989
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:41,127
It ain't... it ain't no more room.

990
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,171
- Nope. No. Like...
- And ain't nowhere to stay.

991
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:46,424
Oh, who cares? We'll shack up
with you guys, Mexico-style!

992
00:43:46,507 --> 00:43:48,176
Come on, you guys. Have you met us?

993
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:50,720
We're so quiet.
Honestly, if we were sharing the same room

994
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:53,472
and you guys were doing
your little freaky, sexual… [babbles]

995
00:43:53,556 --> 00:43:55,266
…fuckfest post-nups...

996
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,435
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

997
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:58,728
Is that your truck?

998
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,522
I'm sorry. This is a private event.

999
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:04,775
It's cool. We know the bride and groom.
And you are?

1000
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,485
I'm Harold Conway.

1001
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:07,695
That's my father.

1002
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,280
Oh, my gosh! Shut up.

1003
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:12,867
You're such a cutie. I feel like
I'm meeting a literal celebrity.

1004
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,869
Hi. [chuckles] Okay!

1005
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,162
He's icy.

1006
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:19,916
I'm Ron. This is Kyla.
Met these two animals down in Mexico.

1007
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:22,835
Got to know each other.
Intimately. [chuckles]

1008
00:44:22,919 --> 00:44:24,420
He didn't mean intimately. He meant…

1009
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:26,797
Are you wearing a military dress uniform?

1010
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,884
Oh. The buttons! [chuckles]
The buttons gave it away.

1011
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,136
And you are aware
that it's a federal offense

1012
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,222
to impersonate a member
of the US military?

1013
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,307
- Yes, I am.
- Then why are you wearing it?

1014
00:44:39,602 --> 00:44:43,439
It's mine. I was in the Army.
I was a Green Beret.

1015
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:44,982
[Harold] Green Beret?

1016
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,901
Coin check.

1017
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:53,324
I haven't been coin checked in forever.

1018
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:00,164
[chuckling] I'll be damned.

1019
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,042
[chuckling] No way! What?

1020
00:45:03,918 --> 00:45:06,629
[Harold] What a treat. [laughs]

1021
00:45:06,712 --> 00:45:09,548
- Please, come on and join us.
- Okay. Wait. Harold, they can't stay.

1022
00:45:09,632 --> 00:45:11,050
- Right?
- Daddy, that's what you told us.

1023
00:45:11,133 --> 00:45:12,093
It's all full, right?

1024
00:45:12,718 --> 00:45:14,929
We Green Berets always have
each other's back.

1025
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,013
Aw, yay!

1026
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:18,099
- Where did you serve, son?
- Four years in Saudi.

1027
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:19,600
Well, I was five in Laos.

1028
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,811
No shit.
Heard you guys had to put jimmy hats

1029
00:45:21,894 --> 00:45:23,646
- on the barrels of your M16s!
- Oh, my God, man.

1030
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:26,065
They were so jam prone, we had to.
We didn't have the…

1031
00:45:26,649 --> 00:45:30,194
How in the hell did they let that maniac
in the military?

1032
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:32,196
He's the most irresponsible person
I've ever met.

1033
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,948
And somehow, he is charming my dad.

1034
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,659
And then Charlie says,
"Take your fist out of there!"

1035
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:39,078
This is only happening because you said,
"See you later."

1036
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:41,872
I said it without meaning it,
like any decent person would.

1037
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:44,208
Damn it, look now. Now he did it...
Now he even got to your mama.

1038
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:46,794
- Oh, no, no.
- Look at your mom. She's smiling.

1039
00:45:47,795 --> 00:45:49,714
- Oh, shit.
- [shaman chanting]

1040
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:51,799
What if he tells them
about our Mayan wedding?

1041
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:56,262
Oh, no, no, no.
What if he say anything about this trip?

1042
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:57,972
Oh, no.

1043
00:45:58,055 --> 00:46:00,808
Okay, look. Okay, we got this.
We just gotta contain it.

1044
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,061
[chattering]

1045
00:46:04,145 --> 00:46:06,063
Hey, uh, w-where are you guys going?

1046
00:46:06,147 --> 00:46:07,940
Oh, I'm gonna show
Ron and Kyla their room.

1047
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:10,359
Wait, Harold.
I thought you said everything was full.

1048
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:13,279
[Harold] Everything was.
Except the Presidential Suite.

1049
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:14,363
So I splurged on it.

1050
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:17,283
- [Kyla] I'm so excited! You're my guy!
- [Harold laughs]

1051
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:19,952
Why wouldn't he do that for us?
We the ones getting married.

1052
00:46:20,036 --> 00:46:22,872
Look, if you need anything,
please let me know.

1053
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:25,499
We will.
And… [sighs] …thanks again, Captain.

1054
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:29,295
Also, I hope you join us in the morning.
We have a little fox hunt lined up.

1055
00:46:29,378 --> 00:46:32,214
- That's easy. Found her.
- [chuckles]

1056
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,302
[Harold] Oh.

1057
00:46:36,385 --> 00:46:38,387
Darn it, I must have left the keys
at the front desk.

1058
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:40,264
- Stand down.
- Sir, yes, sir.

1059
00:46:40,348 --> 00:46:41,474
[Kyla] Bye. That's so sweet.

1060
00:46:41,557 --> 00:46:43,392
- [Emily] Thanks, Dad.
- [Harold] Be right back.

1061
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:47,480
- Okay, look. Um, could you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

1062
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:49,648
'Cause I'm trying to make
a good impression on her family.

1063
00:46:49,732 --> 00:46:50,858
- Sure.
- Totally.

1064
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,404
It's that you don't mention anything
about the Mexico trip. Nothing.

1065
00:46:55,488 --> 00:46:56,822
Nothing at all.

1066
00:46:56,906 --> 00:46:58,407
Oh, Marcus. You're so funny.

1067
00:46:58,491 --> 00:47:00,993
It's just one catamaran.
It's really not a big deal.

1068
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:02,870
Yeah, it's not about the catamaran. Okay?

1069
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,081
It's all the other crazy shit
that happened.

1070
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:08,834
All the insane shit,
it doesn't need to be mentioned here.

1071
00:47:08,918 --> 00:47:09,919
At all.

1072
00:47:10,002 --> 00:47:12,004
Okay, we got you. We got you.
It's just, um…

1073
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:17,259
Well, the, uh... the crazy shit is one
of the reasons we came here.

1074
00:47:17,343 --> 00:47:21,555
See, something happened,
and it's something intense. I just...

1075
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:28,229
Um, I went to the doctor,
and they found a growth in my abdomen.

1076
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,482
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1077
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:34,735
Yeah, and the doctor, I guess he says
it's... it's only gonna get bigger.

1078
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:37,279
Can he operate on it?

1079
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:41,367
[crying] Unfortunately, they can't...
They can't. Sorry. They can't.

1080
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:45,663
The... [clears throat] The doctors say
it's gonna come out on its own.

1081
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:48,290
Through her vagina.

1082
00:47:48,374 --> 00:47:49,667
Huh?

1083
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,504
[chuckles]

1084
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:54,839
I'm preggers!

1085
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:58,134
That's how you're gonna make
that announcement?

1086
00:47:58,217 --> 00:48:00,428
By... By having us think
that you had cancer?

1087
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,721
- Yeah!
- Yeah! You guys. [chuckles]

1088
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:04,932
- Oh, congratulations, I guess.
- [Kyla] Thank you.

1089
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:06,392
Thank you.

1090
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:10,771
Guess, um… I'm really happy for you.

1091
00:48:10,855 --> 00:48:13,649
Aw, thanks, pal.
Hey, that's not the whole story though.

1092
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:17,361
There's something about this baby
that has to deal with you directly.

1093
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,074
What do you mean?

1094
00:48:22,158 --> 00:48:23,367
[Harold] Fubar!

1095
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:27,288
Fubar. My brain is absolutely fubar.

1096
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,748
I had the key in my other pocket
the whole time.

1097
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:30,958
[Kyla] You silly goose.

1098
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,501
- [Harold] Oh, God.
- [Kyla] You goofball.

1099
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:35,463
- Here we go.
- [Kyla] Yes.

1100
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:40,092
Oh, my God! This place is insane!

1101
00:48:40,176 --> 00:48:41,969
[Ron] Permission to shit my pants,
Captain.

1102
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:44,430
[Harold] Permission granted. [chuckles]

1103
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:46,307
- [Ron] VCR!
- [sighs]

1104
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,684
- It's amazing!
- [Kyla] Ooh! I feel like Nancy Reagan.

1105
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:50,895
This should be our room.

1106
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:53,814
[Marcus whispering]
Mexico was seven months ago?

1107
00:48:55,274 --> 00:48:56,525
Seven months?

1108
00:48:57,902 --> 00:48:58,903
[Emily scoffs]

1109
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:00,988
Twice.

1110
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:03,908
Twice they've gotten
the Presidential Suite.

1111
00:49:03,991 --> 00:49:05,284
How does this keep happening?

1112
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:06,702
[scoffs]

1113
00:49:06,785 --> 00:49:09,246
- Baby, can I ask you something?
- Yes, babe.

1114
00:49:09,872 --> 00:49:12,291
It's just a quick question.

1115
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:16,253
Just, I was wondering,
how far along did Kyla look to you?

1116
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,173
[chuckles] I don't know. Why?

1117
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,425
I mean, if you had to take a guess.
You know what I mean?

1118
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:24,136
Just a... just... just a guess.

1119
00:49:25,304 --> 00:49:27,806
Oh, five months? Five and a half? Tops.

1120
00:49:28,807 --> 00:49:29,975
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1121
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:32,436
Yeah. Right. She five and a half months.

1122
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,439
She ain't... She don't look
seven months at all, right? [chuckles]

1123
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:37,650
If she's seven months,
then I'm three months.

1124
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:39,485
And it's yours.

1125
00:49:39,568 --> 00:49:40,611
[chuckling] Yeah, it's mine.

1126
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:43,364
- [Emily] Good night, love.
- Mm-hmm.

1127
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,490
- Mmm.
- [Marcus chuckles]

1128
00:49:44,573 --> 00:49:47,743
[bugle playing]

1129
00:49:47,826 --> 00:49:49,828
[dogs barking]

1130
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:54,166
[chuckles] Oh.

1131
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,043
Mr. Finnegan.

1132
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,129
You know, every time he does this,
I feel like I'm walking in on him.

1133
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:01,006
It's disgusting.

1134
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,258
[Harold sighs]

1135
00:50:02,341 --> 00:50:05,553
I'd like to thank you all for coming out
for this magnificent tradition:

1136
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:08,973
- the pursuit of the elusive gray fox.
- [horse whinnies]

1137
00:50:09,056 --> 00:50:11,767
Now there are a couple of rules
that I'd like you to keep in mind.

1138
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,978
- One…
- Baby, do you see either of them?

1139
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:15,437
No, thank God.

1140
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:18,274
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
I was trying to find the rest of my gear.

1141
00:50:18,357 --> 00:50:19,608
- What the...
- [Kyla] Hey, lover!

1142
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:22,319
Look at what your girl found.

1143
00:50:22,403 --> 00:50:23,487
- Whoo!
- Shh.

1144
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:26,156
It was in the truck the whole time.
It was just wedged under my seat.

1145
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,741
- You're the best.
- I know. I know.

1146
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:30,244
Oh. No, no, no. No guns.
No. No one's killing anything.

1147
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,370
- What?
- What?

1148
00:50:31,453 --> 00:50:33,789
Yeah, it's not even a real fox hunt.
It's a fox chase.

1149
00:50:33,872 --> 00:50:36,083
And no one's seen a fox
around here in years.

1150
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,545
By the way, Kyla, you're pregnant.
That means you're not coming.

1151
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:42,464
- Oh, fuck that.
- [dog barking]

1152
00:50:42,548 --> 00:50:45,718
Excuse me! Lady in the purple.
How do I get one of those?

1153
00:50:46,468 --> 00:50:48,596
Hey, chief.
Could you just get this to the front desk?

1154
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,056
Okay, baby. Let me get this straight.

1155
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,935
I spent the last three months waking up
at the crack of dawn

1156
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,479
to learn how to ride a horse
for a damn nature walk?

1157
00:50:57,563 --> 00:50:59,273
And the most important rule of all…

1158
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,524
[barking continues]

1159
00:51:00,608 --> 00:51:03,110
…have fun. [chuckles]

1160
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:06,447
["Ooh La La" playing]

1161
00:51:22,921 --> 00:51:24,923
Nice grip. Solid trot.

1162
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,217
Marcus, I didn't realize you could ride.

1163
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:30,554
Oh, well, you know,
this ain't the tack that I'm used to.

1164
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:33,766
You know, I prefer western reins.
[chuckles]

1165
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,060
Oh, it's too bad you're wearing
the wrong jacket.

1166
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:40,481
Five buttons is strictly for houndsmen.
[clicks tongue]

1167
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,316
[dogs barking]

1168
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:48,113
Harsh. I got like 12 buttons
on my cargo shorts.

1169
00:51:48,906 --> 00:51:50,407
That guy really doesn't like you, huh?

1170
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:51,492
You think?

1171
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:54,328
You know what? We'll show him.

1172
00:51:55,746 --> 00:51:59,375
Come on, Marcus.
Let's go find a goddamn fox.

1173
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,293
- [Marcus] Wait, what?
- [Ron] Let's do this!

1174
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:14,181
Look, man. This is a big waste of time.
We are not gonna find a fox.

1175
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,685
Let's just ride back to the stables,
get some food because I'm starving.

1176
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:19,770
[birds chirping]

1177
00:52:21,063 --> 00:52:23,440
Hungry no more. [laughs]

1178
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:25,359
That is…

1179
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,278
Oh!

1180
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:29,613
…reindeer moss.

1181
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:32,241
One of the edible Cladonias.

1182
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,369
You gonna eat that shit?

1183
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,204
Yeah, dude. It's a superfood.

1184
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,332
And it only grows in a rare section
of the loblolly pine ecosystem.

1185
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:41,917
Okay, how you know all this weird crap?

1186
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,962
Licensed edible forager, man.
Any self-respecting ranger is.

1187
00:52:45,045 --> 00:52:46,046
Try some?

1188
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:48,674
Nah, I'm good on the tree pubes.

1189
00:52:48,757 --> 00:52:50,884
[laughs]

1190
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:51,969
Tree pubes!

1191
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:54,596
Why you laughing so hard?
It wasn't even that funny.

1192
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,015
You know, that...
that's a joke Charlie would say.

1193
00:52:57,099 --> 00:52:59,143
Sometimes I can't even tell
the two of you apart.

1194
00:52:59,226 --> 00:53:00,644
Here, check this out. [grunts]

1195
00:53:02,062 --> 00:53:05,149
There. Look. [laughing] There he is.
Look at that. You see?

1196
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,569
- That's Charlie?
- Yeah, that's Charlie.

1197
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:12,197
We look nothing alike, okay?
This is a pale white man with red hair.

1198
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:16,076
I'm not talking about his looks, man.
I'm talking about his spirit.

1199
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,163
You both got this hard shell
on the outside,

1200
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:21,874
then one bite
and you get to the gooey center.

1201
00:53:22,374 --> 00:53:24,251
Now come on. Eat the moss.

1202
00:53:26,587 --> 00:53:28,172
You're lucky I'm hungry.

1203
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,679
Okay. It's not that bad.

1204
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:38,515
Boom! Mind open.

1205
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:43,020
See, man. It's like
nature's crisper drawer out here.

1206
00:53:43,103 --> 00:53:46,273
Ooh! Some ramps!
The onion's wild cousin. [grunts]

1207
00:53:48,108 --> 00:53:49,860
[chuckles] Try that.

1208
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:51,737
Oh, man.

1209
00:53:52,404 --> 00:53:53,614
Jackpot.

1210
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:56,867
[chuckles]

1211
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:57,951
Oh, man.

1212
00:54:00,204 --> 00:54:02,122
Okay, look.
I know you're not a big drug guy,

1213
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:05,209
but if you ever wanna unlock the doors to
perception, this, my friend, is the key.

1214
00:54:05,292 --> 00:54:06,126
Wait, what?

1215
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,879
Primarily found in Spain, but around here,
we call it the Devil's Dick.

1216
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:11,381
Most potent magic mushroom on Earth.

1217
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:13,926
You eat one of these babies,
not only will you talk to God,

1218
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:16,220
you'll find a rent-controlled apartment
and move in together.

1219
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:17,638
- I ate it.
- What?

1220
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:19,848
I ate it.

1221
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:21,558
- Why?
- You told me to!

1222
00:54:21,642 --> 00:54:24,102
I said, "Jackpot," and that's it.
I didn't say, "Eat it."

1223
00:54:24,186 --> 00:54:26,063
Man, you are crazy, okay?

1224
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:29,358
Everything you touch turn into drugs!

1225
00:54:29,441 --> 00:54:30,859
Okay? What's gonna happen to me?

1226
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:32,110
Am I about to die?

1227
00:54:32,194 --> 00:54:34,154
No, no. You're not gonna die. Okay?

1228
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:37,032
Part of you is gonna die,
but it's gonna be reborn. You'll be fine.

1229
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:39,076
Something's happening
because everything is purple now.

1230
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:41,662
No, no, no, no. You're being paranoid.
It takes 20 minutes to kick in.

1231
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:42,704
Everything's purple!

1232
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:43,789
Oh, shit.

1233
00:54:44,665 --> 00:54:46,250
I guess only a rookie chasms that fast.

1234
00:54:47,793 --> 00:54:49,169
You need a rope man. Okay.

1235
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,924
- Marcus, I'm going in with you.
- Mm-hmm.

1236
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:56,885
Every step of the way.
[inhales deeply] Deep breaths.

1237
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:59,137
- [inhales] Okay.
- I mean, this is from me to you.

1238
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:03,141
You're a big guy. Focus. Concentrate.

1239
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:06,728
There is a good chance
that nothing's gonna happen.

[Kyla] Emily!

1244
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:33,797
I know I've only been here for a night,
but I've gotta say,

1245
00:55:33,881 --> 00:55:35,299
this wedding is so kick-ass.

1246
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:37,009
Well, at least someone's enjoying it.

1247
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,093
[Kyla] How could you not?

1248
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:39,636
Your family's so freaking cool.

1249
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,806
Everybody's in love with me,
and I haven't even met half of them yet.

1250
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:46,685
Yeah, uh, don't... don't feel pressured,
like, to meet everyone.

1251
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:49,146
You're so sweet.
No, I promise you. You have my word.

1252
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:52,858
I'm gonna have meaningful connections
with literally every single person here.

1253
00:55:52,941 --> 00:55:55,569
I was just so busy talking
to Grandma Phyllis last night

1254
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,237
that I couldn't make the rounds.

1255
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,740
No, Phyllis barely even speaks.

1256
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,534
She's a major, major
chatterbox deep down.

1257
00:56:02,618 --> 00:56:06,038
Harold, I don't know if this is just
Grandma Phyllis starting shit,

1258
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:07,164
but… [chuckles]

1259
00:56:07,247 --> 00:56:10,417
…she said that this wedding
was already more fun than yours was.

1260
00:56:11,126 --> 00:56:12,252
That's not surprising.

1261
00:56:14,046 --> 00:56:15,047
What does that mean?

1262
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:21,094
Well, um, there was a bit of tension
at our wedding.

1263
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:24,348
It wasn't Phyllis.
It was your grandfather and I.

1264
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:29,394
We just got off on the wrong foot,
and he never gave me another chance.

1265
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:31,271
That sounds familiar.

1266
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:34,942
Maybe now's the perfect time
for you to give Marcus another chance.

00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,417
[distorted] Oh… Oh, I heard that.
Did you hear that?

1272
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:54,503
I heard it. I didn't know I could hear...

1273
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:57,714
It's like, I know I can see shit,
but I didn't know I was hearing shit too.

What is that?

00:57:04,596 --> 00:57:05,597
It's a fox.

[chuckles]

1279
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:10,352

[whispering] Behind you.

1283
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,544
- Don't move.
- [whispering] Okay.

1284
00:57:36,128 --> 00:57:37,546
Or make a sound.

1285
00:57:37,629 --> 00:57:39,131
Don't say a single word.

1286
00:57:39,214 --> 00:57:40,340
You're talking right now.

1287
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:41,425
No, I'm not.

1288
00:57:43,802 --> 00:57:44,803
So what do we do?

1289
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:47,431
I'm gonna go make a snare
out of that flora.

1290
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:50,100
You stay here.

1291
00:57:50,851 --> 00:57:53,020
What do you mean, "Stay here," Ron?
Where you going?

1292
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,439
Ron. Ron.

1293
00:57:56,148 --> 00:57:57,149
Ron.

1294
00:57:57,733 --> 00:57:59,109
Don't worry.

1295
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,279

Mount up, everyone!

1301
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,500
[screaming continues]

1302
00:58:15,584 --> 00:58:17,544
- Get off me!
- Grab it! Subdue it!

1303
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:20,338
Fuck that! Get it off me!

- Fuck! Get it off!

What are you doing?

1306
00:58:30,515 --> 00:58:32,267
[growling continues]

[horse whinnies]

1308
00:58:43,779 --> 00:58:45,447
Mr. Finnegan likes him.

1309
00:58:48,784 --> 00:58:50,285
What the fuck?

1310
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:51,870
[Harold] Mr. Finnegan. [whistles]

1311
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:54,623
[sighs] Marcus, are you okay?

1312
00:58:54,706 --> 00:58:56,291
Sweetie, I will…

1313
00:58:59,086 --> 00:59:00,462
Let me help you up there.

1314
00:59:02,714 --> 00:59:03,799
[grunts]

1315
00:59:04,382 --> 00:59:07,010
This isn't easy to say, Marcus,

1316
00:59:07,928 --> 00:59:10,680
but I think we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

1317
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:13,016
I see things my way, and...

1318
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,477
[laughs]

1319
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,895
What's so funny?

1320
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:18,480
You're a clown!

1321
00:59:19,815 --> 00:59:21,858
- Excuse me?
- [Marcus] You're a clown.

1322
00:59:22,984 --> 00:59:25,070
[laughs]

1323
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:27,906
Look, if I can interject
for just a second, Harold.

1324
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:29,950
Marcus and I have been talking
about you all weekend.

1325
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,952
- What? About my being a clown?
- [Ron] Yes.

1326
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:35,330
Yes, but, you know,
a wedding is like a big, old circus.

1327
00:59:35,413 --> 00:59:38,500
And you, you're the star of the show.

1328
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:39,668
[Marcus] Oh, shit.

1329
00:59:40,961 --> 00:59:43,171
- I'm made of metal.
- What... What is going on here?

1330
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,926
Uh, what Marcus means is
that his commitment to your daughter…

1331
00:59:49,094 --> 00:59:50,262
is as strong as steel.

1332
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:53,890
Captain, Marcus has told me many times
that he looks up to you.

1333
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,560
And he hopes that one day,

1334
00:59:56,643 --> 00:59:59,646
you can all become a real, true family
despite your differences.

1335
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:00,730
No!

1336
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,441
Because of them.

1337
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:04,484
He said that?

1338
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:05,694
He did. Word for word.

1339
01:00:06,278 --> 01:00:07,279
You said that?

1340
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:10,490
Mm-hmm.

1341
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,331
Lieutenant.

1342
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:21,585
Whatever.

1343
01:00:23,044 --> 01:00:24,838
Oh, fuck. He bought it, dude. I can't...

1344
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:28,758
What the fuck? Metal? Come on. Shit.

1345
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:30,510
- I'm in the circus.
- [huffs]

1346
01:00:31,178 --> 01:00:34,014
[Marcus] Do you realize
I almost killed that dog? Fucking Ron.

1347
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,473
[Emily] Hey, cut him some slack.

1348
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:38,518
He actually covered for you with my dad.

1349
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:41,354
Like, he kind of saved your ass.

1350
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:43,607
Wait a minute.
Is Grandma Phyllis over there talking?

1351
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:45,066
How's that even possible?

1352
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,986
[Emily] Kyla has been really obsessed
with her lately.

1353
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:50,071
Uh-uh. This is not good.

1354
01:00:51,406 --> 01:00:52,407
[chuckles]

1355
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,075
Damn, how many cousins I got?

1356
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:56,161
Some happy cousins. Why they so happy?

1357
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:57,579
I don't know.

1358
01:00:57,662 --> 01:00:59,456
Tell 'em I say hi. [chuckles]

1359
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:10,675
Hey, good morning, sleepyhead.
I was just getting this for you.

1360
01:01:10,759 --> 01:01:12,928
A little something to get
those synapses firing.

1361
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:16,598
- Why? What you put in here?
- It's grapefruit juice.

1362
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,934
And heroin.

1363
01:01:19,768 --> 01:01:22,312
Kidding. Just drink it.
You'll feel better.

1364
01:01:23,063 --> 01:01:24,940
- Can I be honest with you, man?
- Yeah.

1365
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,067
I really don't get you.

1366
01:01:27,734 --> 01:01:29,027
What's there to get?

1367
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,613
I mean, everywhere we go,
chaos happens. Right?

1368
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:34,449
But everybody else panics, but not you.

1369
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:37,494
You stay calm and collected.
Like, you don't worry about any of it.

1370
01:01:37,577 --> 01:01:39,204
One night in Green Beret training,

1371
01:01:39,287 --> 01:01:41,623
they woke us up, put us in a boat,
drove us a mile offshore,

1372
01:01:41,706 --> 01:01:43,458
dumped us in the water
and said, "Swim back."

1373
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,044
I watched so many guys
wear themselves out

1374
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:48,088
swimming against the riptide
as hard as they could.

1375
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:53,718
They had to be extracted. Me?
I found out the trick was just float.

1376
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:57,472
Look, I've never been the type of person
that can just float, you know?

1377
01:01:57,555 --> 01:01:59,015
Marcus, you're missing the point.

1378
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:03,103
Yeah, real story, but a metaphor, because
it has nothing to do with your body mass.

1379
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,522
I understand that. I mean,
I know what metaphors are. I was...

1380
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,941
Do you? Do you?

1381
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:12,028
If it isn't Special Forces
and special… stupid idiot.

1382
01:02:12,112 --> 01:02:13,989
You're lucky you didn't hurt
my dad's dog yesterday,

1383
01:02:14,072 --> 01:02:15,699
'cause if you did, I would've hurt you.

1384
01:02:15,782 --> 01:02:19,369
Okay, Gabe. Is that right?
Right? You gonna kick my ass?

1385
01:02:19,452 --> 01:02:21,496
- You wanna go right here, right now?
- I think he wants to.

1386
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:22,831
'Cause we can do that.

1387
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:26,334
If I may. Gabe, it looks like
you're trying to lead with a power jab.

1388
01:02:26,418 --> 01:02:28,878
Let's get those hips in. Get warmed up...

1389
01:02:28,962 --> 01:02:31,298
Hey. What are you... Hands off.

1390
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,507
Whoa! Okay, man. I'm just...

1391
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,134
Listen, I'm not here to fight anyway.

1392
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,885
My father sent me here
to collect the rings.

1393
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:39,139
I guess the best man is supposed to
carry the rings, so that's why I'm here.

1394
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:46,688
You know something? I'ma give these to
my best man, but to my new best man, Ron.

1395
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:48,315
- Here you go, brother.
- You mean it?

1396
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,483
- Can he do that?
- No, he cannot do that.

1397
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,653
It's already been done. That's right.
That's my best man right there.

1398
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:57,407
Marcus, this means…
more to me than you'll ever know.

1399
01:02:58,241 --> 01:02:59,951
[Marcus] Oh, man. It's all good, br...

1400
01:03:02,871 --> 01:03:03,705
<i>Salaam.</i>

1401
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:08,043
Whatever. Okay.

1402
01:03:08,126 --> 01:03:09,794
See you at tee off, assholes.

1403
01:03:12,339 --> 01:03:14,341
I do not like the way they talk to you.

1404
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:18,345
All right. They gone.
You can give me the rings back.

1405
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:20,430
What? No. I... You... We just said... What?

1406
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:22,766
No, no. That...
I was doing that in front of them.

1407
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:25,268
I'm actually gonna keep the rings,
so you just give 'em back to me.

1408
01:03:25,352 --> 01:03:28,271
Marcus, you made me your best man.
That's that. Best man holds the rings.

1409
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:30,648
Yes, I know what
"traditionally" the best man do...

1410
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:32,776
You can't just say
the best man holds the rings

1411
01:03:32,859 --> 01:03:34,986
and then not let
the best man hold the rings.

1412
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,154
I got you.

1413
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:42,911
Well, Marcus, good to have you back.

1414
01:03:42,994 --> 01:03:44,329
That sunstroke is no joke.

1415
01:03:44,412 --> 01:03:49,667
So, people,
stay hydrated with... with water.

1416
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:54,005
The marshals are very strict when it
comes to alcohol, wagering and profanity.

1417
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:57,550
- Now we're on a championship course here.
- [shaman chanting]

1418
01:03:57,634 --> 01:04:01,179
So we are going
to be keeping this club pristine.

1419
01:04:01,262 --> 01:04:05,725
So, Gabe, uh, why don't you and Bennett
play with Marcus and Ron today.

1420
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:06,976
Where's Ron anyway?

1421
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,061
Got your six, Captain.

1422
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:11,731
Ah, Lieutenant, good to see you.
Hope you're comfortable in a foursome.

1423
01:04:11,815 --> 01:04:13,775
As long as there's
at least one girl involved.

1424
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:18,613
All right, dick holes.
How much we betting?

1425
01:04:18,696 --> 01:04:21,699
Hey, hey, man. Didn't you hear what
he said? No drinking and no gambling.

1426
01:04:21,783 --> 01:04:24,244
Marcus. Relax. Have some fun, all right?

1427
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,745
What do you say a hundred a hole?

1428
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:26,830
Count me in.

1429
01:04:26,913 --> 01:04:27,789
[Bennett] Me too.

1430
01:04:27,872 --> 01:04:31,334
Tell you what. Let's keep it fresh.
Back nine we double the stakes.

1431
01:04:31,418 --> 01:04:32,836
- Double?
- Problem?

1432
01:04:32,919 --> 01:04:35,213
[chuckles] Please.
You see what I'm driving?

1433
01:04:35,296 --> 01:04:36,589
[Ron] That's you, the red one?

1434
01:04:37,966 --> 01:04:39,592
What is that? A Corvette, pre-owned?

1435
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:42,262
- It's a Ferrari, you dipshit.
- $250,000.

1436
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:43,596
- Bought her brand-new.
- Boom.

1437
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,722
[imitates sizzle]

1438
01:04:44,806 --> 01:04:47,058
[Gabe] Now, Marcus,
I understand a hundred dollars a hole

1439
01:04:47,142 --> 01:04:48,893
is a lot of green
for a blue-collar worker,

1440
01:04:48,977 --> 01:04:50,645
so if you need to back out,
go ahead and do it now.

1441
01:04:50,728 --> 01:04:51,813
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

1442
01:04:51,896 --> 01:04:53,064
- No, fuck you.
- Fuck you again.

1443
01:04:53,148 --> 01:04:55,608
No, kiss my... You know?
Let me holla at you real quick.

1444
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:56,818
Can you excuse us?

1445
01:04:57,944 --> 01:04:59,821
Man, I don't have that type of green.

1446
01:04:59,904 --> 01:05:02,282
Marcus, don't worry. I'll bankroll you.
Pay me back later.

1447
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,033
Bankroll me with what?

1448
01:05:04,117 --> 01:05:05,118
How about this?

1449
01:05:05,994 --> 01:05:07,036
Where'd you get that?

1450
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,873
Who cares? Just help me whup
the Brooks Brothers over there. Come on.

1451
01:05:09,956 --> 01:05:11,541
I would love to beat these two assholes…

1452
01:05:11,624 --> 01:05:13,042
- Do it.
- …but I suck at golf!

1453
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:14,752
That's why you're lucky
I'm your best man.

1454
01:05:15,628 --> 01:05:17,755
["Space Ho's" playing]

1455
01:05:23,094 --> 01:05:25,305
What was that?
Thought you said you was good?

1456
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,015
I am. I just gotta get warmed up.

1457
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:29,851
You gotta get warmed up?

1458
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:31,603
- Want a hit?
- No!

1459
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:33,688
[song continues]

1460
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:39,068
Woo-hoo!

1461
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:41,613
[Gabe, Bennett] Ha! Ha!

1462
01:05:44,866 --> 01:05:47,702
Thank you so much. [chuckles]

1463
01:05:50,288 --> 01:05:54,125
[Emily's mother] Jesus,
I wish we had never hired this caterer.

1464
01:05:54,209 --> 01:05:56,002
Now he's telling me

1465
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:58,588
that he's having trouble sourcing steaks
for tomorrow night.

1466
01:05:58,671 --> 01:06:00,632
I'm so sorry,
but I do just have to go on record

1467
01:06:00,715 --> 01:06:02,550
and say that I told you
to go with Ford Fry.

1468
01:06:02,634 --> 01:06:04,385
- You did not listen to me…
- Brooke, please.

1469
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:06,971
Okay. [stammers] Guys, please, for me.

1470
01:06:07,055 --> 01:06:11,267
Mom, I am super positive
that the caterer will figure it all out.

1471
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:15,063
So for the next two hours,
can we just not think about steak?

1472
01:06:15,146 --> 01:06:17,190
- Yes, dear.
- [whispering] Thank you.

1473
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:20,735
Wait, guys, steaks?
I know a place that has amazing steaks.

1474
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:23,821
Ron and I just went there on our way
here 'cause it's right down the block.

1475
01:06:23,905 --> 01:06:27,575
Hal's in Buckhead?
They were asking $300 a plate.

1476
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:29,744
Oh, no. Girl, this place is under ten.

1477
01:06:29,827 --> 01:06:31,371
Damn, that's a steal.

1478
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,165
- What restaurant is this?
- Oh, it's called Waffle House.

1479
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:37,085
[all laughing]

1480
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,714
Well, even I don't like Waffle House.

1481
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:43,758
Trust me, you guys. It's amazing.

1482
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:46,469
- Oh, my God. Is she serious?
- No, no, Mom. She's...

1483
01:06:46,553 --> 01:06:50,974
Whenever Ron and I are stressed or horny
or I have trouble going number two...

1484
01:06:51,057 --> 01:06:52,642
Hey, Kyla. You know what?

1485
01:06:52,725 --> 01:06:55,687
I think we're gonna just be here
in this moment,

1486
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:58,731
enjoying the spa, relaxing. Yeah.

1487
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:02,485
Got you, Em. I swear I will stop talking,
and we should get our Zen on, right?

1488
01:07:02,569 --> 01:07:04,279
'Cause that's why we're at the spa.

1489
01:07:04,362 --> 01:07:05,905
[sighs]

1490
01:07:06,698 --> 01:07:10,118
Oh, Brooke, you remember when we had
our spa day right before your wedding?

1491
01:07:11,035 --> 01:07:12,453
Those hot stones were...

1492
01:07:12,537 --> 01:07:13,788
[sobbing]

1493
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:16,249
Oh, my God. Not again, please.

1494
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:18,585
- [Marcus's mother] Oh, no.
- [Kyla] What's the matter?

1495
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:21,421
We're getting destroyed out there.

1496
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:23,840
- I thought you said you was good?
- I am good. You'll see.

1497
01:07:23,923 --> 01:07:25,091
Ernesto!

1498
01:07:27,135 --> 01:07:28,136
Sorry.

1499
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:31,431
[Bennett sighs]

1500
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:33,266
My man.

1501
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,476
Love that guy.

1502
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,020
Did you just tip him $100?

1503
01:07:37,604 --> 01:07:38,521
I have plenty left.

1504
01:07:38,605 --> 01:07:40,231
Where did you get all that cash from?

1505
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:43,067
I pawned the wedding rings.

1506
01:07:43,651 --> 01:07:44,902
- No, you didn't.
- No, I did.

1507
01:07:45,903 --> 01:07:47,196
- No, you didn't.
- No, I did.

1508
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,449
- No, you didn't.
- I did. Totally. Here.

1509
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:53,161
Here's the receipt.
Northside Jewelry and Loans.

1510
01:07:55,663 --> 01:07:56,998
[whispering] Oh, you did.

1511
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:01,085
What the hell is wrong with you?

1512
01:08:01,169 --> 01:08:02,545
I just got good with Harold.

1513
01:08:02,629 --> 01:08:04,172
Pick 'em up when we win.

1514
01:08:04,255 --> 01:08:05,673
Pick 'em up when we win?

1515
01:08:05,757 --> 01:08:08,509
[shouting] We're losing every hole!

1516
01:08:08,593 --> 01:08:12,388
- [birds chirping]
- [man] Come on, gentlemen. Man on the tee.

1517
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:15,683
[sniffles] I'm so sorry.
I just can't breathe right now.

1518
01:08:15,767 --> 01:08:17,352
- [Emily's mother] Oh!
- [Kyla] Brooke.

1519
01:08:17,435 --> 01:08:19,437
Sweetheart, it's okay. What's wrong?

1520
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,856
Back when we were dating,
Darren was so sweet.

1521
01:08:21,939 --> 01:08:23,274
No, he wasn't.

1522
01:08:23,358 --> 01:08:24,901
[Brooke] A little. He was a little sweet.

1523
01:08:24,984 --> 01:08:27,320
Well, what did Darren do to you,
sweetheart?

1524
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,947
He's super mean to me all the time.
He says mean things.

1525
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:31,658
Sweetie, what do you do about it?

1526
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,493
- Kyla.
- What? No, I'm serious.

1527
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,787
- What do you mean? I...
- Okay, guys. Here's the thing.

1528
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:39,374
I dated a lot of shitheads
before I met Ron, love of my life.

1529
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:42,043
They were just like Darren.
These are the kind of guys that are like...

1530
01:08:42,126 --> 01:08:44,962
They think they're the alpha,
but deep down,

1531
01:08:45,046 --> 01:08:47,590
- they know they're just a little bitch.
- Okay, Kyla…

1532
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:51,094
Next time Darren steps out of line,
you pop him in the balls.

1533
01:08:51,177 --> 01:08:52,136
Who are you?

1534
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,554
- You can do it very nicely.
- This person is insane.

1535
01:08:53,638 --> 01:08:56,224
I have a couple restraining orders.
It's not that big of a deal.

1536
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:59,310
- [muttering]
- This is a criminal. This is a criminal.

1537
01:08:59,394 --> 01:09:01,896
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. Let's go chat.

1538
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:04,941
Are you sure you wanna leave them? Because
we have our massages in two minutes,

1539
01:09:05,024 --> 01:09:07,402
- and we're getting so much free shit...
- What are you doing?

1540
01:09:07,485 --> 01:09:12,281
What? I was just trying to be helpful
and give your sister some advice.

1541
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:15,034
By suggesting that she pop her husband
in the balls?

1542
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,244
Yes.

1543
01:09:16,828 --> 01:09:19,080
- Oh, my God. Please.
- What?

1544
01:09:19,163 --> 01:09:24,043
Kyla,
this weekend is already so stressful.

1545
01:09:24,127 --> 01:09:27,338
All I'm asking is that you not add
to that stress.

1546
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,465
Can you please do that for me?

1547
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:31,509
[whispering] Okay.

1548
01:09:32,218 --> 01:09:33,344
Why are you whispering?

1549
01:09:33,428 --> 01:09:35,930
Well, because you thought
I was too loud in there.

1550
01:09:37,265 --> 01:09:39,267
[sighs] God.

1551
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,727
[Gabe, Ron] Two, three, four.

1552
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:43,146
- [groans]
- [groans, chuckles]

1553
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:45,314
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Put some respect on it.

1554
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:46,899
Watch out.

1555
01:09:46,983 --> 01:09:49,026
- [Marcus] Okay. How much you got left?
- Not a lot.

1556
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:51,779
- We're gonna never get those rings back.
- [Ron] All right, boys. Last hole.

1557
01:09:51,863 --> 01:09:52,905
Let's do something big.

1558
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:55,742
Double or nothing. All in. I stick it
on the green from here in one shot.

1559
01:09:55,825 --> 01:09:58,369
Double or nothing? That's what you... No!

1560
01:09:58,453 --> 01:10:00,121
No. No double or nothing. No!

1561
01:10:00,204 --> 01:10:02,248
You do realize
you haven't hit a green all day, right?

1562
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,208
Wait. Haven't I?

1563
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:07,628
You know what? We're in. Actually,
let's make it a little interesting.

1564
01:10:07,712 --> 01:10:09,672
Let's put Bennett's Ferrari in the pot.

1565
01:10:09,756 --> 01:10:11,841
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

1566
01:10:11,924 --> 01:10:13,009
That's like 45 grand.

1567
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,385
Forty-five thousand?

1568
01:10:16,554 --> 01:10:17,555
It's pre-owned.

1569
01:10:18,264 --> 01:10:19,265
We can match that.

1570
01:10:20,558 --> 01:10:25,062
One shot. I stick it on the 18th green
from here, we win.

1571
01:10:26,063 --> 01:10:28,608
I miss by an inch, we lose.

1572
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:32,236
Ron. Ron. I can't do that.

1573
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,739
Come on. You can, man.
Remember, just float.

1574
01:10:34,822 --> 01:10:36,866
What the fuck you mean floating?
Fuck floating.

1575
01:10:36,949 --> 01:10:37,950
[Bennett] Fine.

1576
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,744
- It's a bet.
- Fine.

1577
01:10:42,121 --> 01:10:43,080
All right, gentlemen.

1578
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:46,417
For the record, this is a Titleist 7
with two pink dots. Do we agree?

1579
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:49,629
Yes. We do agree that
you are a dumbass.

1580
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,255
That is the wrong hole.

1581
01:10:51,339 --> 01:10:52,548
That's the seventh green.

1582
01:10:52,632 --> 01:10:56,511
The 18th green… that way.

1583
01:11:05,978 --> 01:11:08,731
Three hundred and seventy-five yards.
Dogleg left.

1584
01:11:08,815 --> 01:11:10,441
Good luck hitting over the trees.

1585
01:11:10,525 --> 01:11:11,901
[Bennett] And no backing out.

1586
01:11:12,443 --> 01:11:13,569
We shook on it.

1587
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:15,154
- Mm-hmm.
- [Bennett giggling]

1588
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:16,572
Aw.

1589
01:11:16,656 --> 01:11:17,657
[Bennett chuckles]

1590
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:24,997
I can't watch this.

1591
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:30,294
[sighs]

1592
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,610
[together] Whoa.

1593
01:11:55,862 --> 01:11:57,780
- [shaman chanting]
- [sighs]

1594
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:06,789
- [Bennett] You see it?
- [Gabe] No.

1595
01:12:06,873 --> 01:12:08,374
- Do you see... No. No, no.
- [cart approaching]

1596
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:09,625
It's not on the green.

1597
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:14,046
It's not on the green.
Oh. It's not on the green.

1598
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,007
Could've sworn I got all of it.

1599
01:12:17,258 --> 01:12:18,551
Check the cup.

1600
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,636
- Check the cup? [chuckles]
- Check these nuts.

1601
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,351
[shaman chanting]

01:12:29,729 --> 01:12:30,730
"Titleist 7."

Two pink dots.

1604
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:35,026
What?

1605
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:36,694
- [Ron, Marcus laughing]
- [alarm chirps]

1606
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:37,612
[Ron] Yes.

1607
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:40,823
[Marcus] You was hustling them the whole
time? Where you learn to play like that?

1608
01:12:40,907 --> 01:12:44,952
[Ron] Army shrink. He said golf was good
for PTSD. I got a little obsessed.

1609
01:12:45,036 --> 01:12:47,079
But that was a hole in one.
What are the chances?

1610
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,497
[chuckling] Uh, roughly zero.

1611
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:51,042
- So, you cheated?
- I do not cheat.

1612
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:52,668
I put that on the green fair and square.

1613
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:55,338
Ernesto. Remember my guy?

1614
01:12:55,421 --> 01:12:58,090
I had him kick it in the cup to make
it awesome, which it totally was.

1615
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,635
Well, look at you now, brother.
You own a new Ferrari.

1616
01:13:00,718 --> 01:13:03,471
Nah, man. We'll enjoy this for a bit,
but I'm... I'm giving it back.

1617
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:05,890
I only did it for one reason, Marcus.

1618
01:13:06,724 --> 01:13:11,187
No one, and I mean no one, talks to you
the way they did at breakfast.

1619
01:13:11,270 --> 01:13:14,357
Thank you. And I appreciate that. So,
we can... Can we just go get the ring...

1620
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,777
You made me your best man, and with that
comes a solemn oath of responsibility.

1621
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:21,280
Cool. And you're right. It comes with...

1622
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:23,449
Responsibility to always have your back.

1623
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:30,289
I give you my word.
I will never, ever… ever let you down.

1624
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:31,540
Ron, I get it.

1625
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:35,628
I get it. You got my back. But can we now
go get the rings? Like... Like right now.

1626
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,129
Sure, man. What's the rush?

1627
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:39,799
Pawnshop closes at 6:00. It's like 2:45.

1628
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,550
What are you talking about? It's 5:45.

1629
01:13:41,634 --> 01:13:43,177
Oh, shit. [chuckles]

1630
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,596
My watch is still on Oregon time.
I never changed it.

1631
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:49,016
I was wondering why it gets dark
out here so early.

1632
01:13:50,768 --> 01:13:51,602
What?

- [Ron] See, man? Just like I told you.

1647
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:38,733
You just gotta float and, somehow,
it all works out. You feel better?

1648
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:42,194
- Did you ask me if I feel better?
- Yeah.

1649

Are you serious?

1650

Do I feel better?
You know how close that was?

What if somebody came in
and bought these rings?

1655

We wouldn't have been able
to get back the rings.

1656

We'd have to get some rings from some dead

I didn't know you were gonna drop 'em.
I just was trying to save your sh...

1670
01:16:16,831 --> 01:16:20,876
You were trying to save
my shoes. [laughs]

1671
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,005
You don't care about my wedding or
me being happy for the rest of my life...

1672
01:16:25,089 --> 01:16:27,007
I just didn't know what
was gonna happen.

1673
01:16:27,091 --> 01:16:28,217
Ah! Motherfucker!

1674
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:31,387
Hey. Okay.
You're choking me, man. You're...

1675
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:32,680
- [grunts]
- [panting]

1676
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:34,056
You're choking me.

1677
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,599
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1678
01:16:35,683 --> 01:16:37,393
Marcus, I'm trained to escape this.

1679
01:16:38,602 --> 01:16:41,230
But I won't. You're my friend. [coughs]

1680
01:16:41,313 --> 01:16:43,315
I think you need
to express your feelings here.

1681
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,192
Feelings? I feel great.

1682
01:16:45,276 --> 01:16:48,237
I feel so good. This the best
I've felt all fucking weekend.

1683
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:50,865
[choking] Got it. Before you choke me
out, there's something you should know.

1684
01:16:50,948 --> 01:16:52,032
Shut up!

1685
01:16:52,116 --> 01:16:54,994
Back before Mexico, the doctors said
I could never have a baby. [coughs]

1686
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,872
They said I was sterile. [coughs]

1687
01:16:57,955 --> 01:16:59,039
Wait, wait. What?

1688
01:16:59,123 --> 01:17:01,041
I went to see a bunch of specialists.

1689
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:04,795
Out-of-pocket cost is so damn high
with the deductibles. I should have...

1690
01:17:04,879 --> 01:17:06,547
Get to the fucking point!

1691
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,633
Back in Mexico, Kyla got pregnant.
[coughs]

1692
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:10,926
And…

1693
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:14,972
it's because… [coughs] …of you.

1694
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:18,893
- Oh, God.
- Okay. Passing out.

1695
01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:22,396
[coughing, wheezing]

1696
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:24,690
Aw, man. Never mind, I'm good.

1697
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:25,858
[body thuds]

1698
01:17:27,526 --> 01:17:28,527
[whispering] What?

1699
01:17:29,278 --> 01:17:30,571
[panting]

1700
01:17:30,654 --> 01:17:31,989
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1701
01:17:34,325 --> 01:17:37,369
- [jazz music playing on speakers]
- [chattering]

1702
01:17:39,538 --> 01:17:40,706
[sighs]

1703
01:17:44,752 --> 01:17:46,629
- [chuckling] Hey, everybody.
- [Emily scoffs]

1704
01:17:47,213 --> 01:17:48,589
We... We need to talk.

1705
01:17:48,672 --> 01:17:51,592
Where have you been?
My brother got back from golf an hour ago.

1706
01:17:51,675 --> 01:17:54,553
I really need to talk to you
about something, like, right now.

1707
01:17:55,137 --> 01:17:56,180
- Right now?
- Yes.

1708
01:17:56,263 --> 01:18:00,684
So, Kyla's not five months pregnant.
She got pregnant in Mexico.

1709
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:01,769
So?

1710
01:18:02,603 --> 01:18:03,604
So…

1711
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,398
um… [chuckles]

1712
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:09,276
…you know that night got a little...
got a little crazy,

1713
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,863
and we never... we never actually
discussed everything that happened.

1714
01:18:12,947 --> 01:18:14,240
Like what?

1715
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:18,994
Like, you know, we had sex
in the same room. Me and you.

1716
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:25,751
But also, it was, like, partners
in the room also having sex.

1717
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:30,047
But not with their particular partners.

1718
01:18:33,133 --> 01:18:35,344
You understand where
I'm going with this?

1719
01:18:35,427 --> 01:18:37,304
[sighs]

1720
01:18:37,388 --> 01:18:40,349
Yes. I… I know.

1721
01:18:41,809 --> 01:18:42,810
You do?

1722
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:47,314
I know exactly what happened.
I was there, Marcus.

1723
01:18:47,898 --> 01:18:49,066
[door opens]

1724
01:18:49,149 --> 01:18:51,610
[chattering]

1725
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:53,279
Uh…

1726
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:54,363
Baby, is that Zeke?

1727
01:18:57,157 --> 01:18:59,368
And Enzo and Fred.

1728
01:19:00,452 --> 01:19:02,037
Who the hell are these people?

1729
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:03,163
Surprise!

1730
01:19:03,247 --> 01:19:04,248
- Hey.
- Hey.

1731
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,750
What the hell you doing here?
Matter of fact, why you not at work?

1732
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:09,503
Nice place, boss. Yeah, I would not
have let us come to this either.

1733
01:19:09,586 --> 01:19:11,463
But we do appreciate the invitation.

1734
01:19:11,547 --> 01:19:13,674
What you mean "invitation"?
I didn't invite you. Who...

1735
01:19:14,633 --> 01:19:15,718
Who did invite you?

1736
01:19:15,801 --> 01:19:17,344
[Ron] Uh, ladies and gentlemen…

1737
01:19:17,428 --> 01:19:19,054
Good evening everyone, and welcome.

1738
01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:20,973
- [giggles]
- [shaman chanting]

1739
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,474
What is he doing up there?

1740
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:25,519
Captain, uh, permission to say a few
words about the happy couple?

1741
01:19:25,602 --> 01:19:26,645
[chuckles]

1742
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:29,606
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ron. I'm Marcus's <i>suku'un.</i>

1743
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:32,484
Of course, you wouldn't know that if you
saw him choking me in the street earlier.

1744
01:19:32,568 --> 01:19:34,153
- The fuck is he talking 'bout?
- Shh.

1745
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,156
Marcus. Bet you're surprised
to see your pals from work, huh?

1746
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,742
When I heard Kyla and I were
your only close friends here,

1747
01:19:39,825 --> 01:19:41,660
I called Parker Construction myself,

1748
01:19:41,744 --> 01:19:45,205
and I told them,
"You better get your butts on a plane!"

1749
01:19:45,289 --> 01:19:46,373
'Cause let's face it,

1750
01:19:46,957 --> 01:19:49,710
it's times like these when you want
your closest friends by your side.

1751
01:19:49,793 --> 01:19:52,296
I was best man for my army pal,
Charlie Anderton.

1752
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:54,048
Man, Charlie and I are super close.

1753
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:56,884
Like, I talk to him every day.

1754
01:19:57,468 --> 01:20:00,304
Never in my life did I think
I'd have another friend like Charlie.

1755
01:20:02,056 --> 01:20:05,142
And then Marcus and I crossed paths
in Mexico, and I know. I know.

1756
01:20:05,225 --> 01:20:07,019
I'm not supposed to talk about Mexico.

1757
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:08,312
[chuckles]

1758
01:20:08,395 --> 01:20:12,441
It was just that moment where
Emily and Marcus became like family

1759
01:20:12,524 --> 01:20:14,026
to Kyla and me.

1760
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,863
But little did we know just how much
like family we would become.

1761
01:20:19,323 --> 01:20:21,075
- Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kyla.
- [chuckles]

1762
01:20:21,158 --> 01:20:24,536
Thank you, baby.
Isn't he so cute, you guys?

1763
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:29,083
Don't you wanna bake him at 350
till his skin gets crispy?

1764
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:30,167
[giggles] I do.

1765
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,461
Um, as you can see,
I'm currently with child,

1766
01:20:32,544 --> 01:20:36,006
which is, like, actually insane
because Ron and I were told that kids,

1767
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:38,092
like, weren't gonna be
in the cards for us.

1768
01:20:38,175 --> 01:20:41,553
Without going into too much detail,
it was a semen issue.

1769
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:44,390
You know what I mean?
So for us, he could shoot far.

1770
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:45,891
Not like my friend Sue's husband

1771
01:20:45,974 --> 01:20:48,268
who it kinda trickles off the top
of the dick like a waterfall.

1772
01:20:48,352 --> 01:20:50,437
No, when he shoots, he shoots fast.

1773
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:52,856
He shoots hard.
He shoots, like, a straight shot.

1774
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:57,152
So it's more kind of like what's in
the shots that's the problem. [chuckles]

1775
01:20:57,236 --> 01:21:00,406
Anyway, Larry and Nancy, rest assured.

1776
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:04,201
Because even if these two choose
to not have kids of their own,

1777
01:21:04,284 --> 01:21:06,286
your legacy is alive and well

1778
01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:10,791
and kicking right here inside of me
in my fertile womb.

1779
01:21:10,874 --> 01:21:13,669
- This is what I was trying to tell you.
- What are you talking about?

1780
01:21:13,752 --> 01:21:17,756
But something super magical happened
when we were in Mexico.

1781
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:22,469
And, Marcus, you are destined to play a
really important part in our child's life.

1782
01:21:23,095 --> 01:21:27,766
I am so excited to announce
to all of you that this baby is...

1783
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,976
Is mine!

1784
01:21:29,059 --> 01:21:30,853
- It's mine.
- [guests gasping, murmuring]

1785
01:21:30,936 --> 01:21:36,817
The baby she's carrying…
It's my... It's my baby.

1786
01:21:39,153 --> 01:21:40,195
[whispering] I'm confused.

1787
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:43,907
I was taught by them to step up
and do what's right, and I'm doing it.

1788
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:45,367
Pass me the wine.

1789
01:21:45,451 --> 01:21:49,037
Me and Emily took a trip to Mexico
where we met these two.

1790
01:21:49,121 --> 01:21:53,459
And, uh, one night, we got really drunk.

1791
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:58,714
Like, like insanely drunk,
like really fucked up.

1792
01:21:58,797 --> 01:22:04,344
I was toe up, and things got
a little, um… a little weird.

1793
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:09,975
Sexually. It got sexually weird.

1794
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:15,564
Which led to me unintentionally,
'cause it wasn't my intentions to do this,

1795
01:22:15,647 --> 01:22:18,775
I unintentionally gave this woman a baby.

1796
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:21,236
So now she's carrying my child.

1797
01:22:21,904 --> 01:22:24,698
It is what it is. That's my baby.

1798
01:22:27,034 --> 01:22:28,577
Actually, no.

1799
01:22:30,787 --> 01:22:35,125
We just wanted to share with you
that it's a boy,

1800
01:22:36,126 --> 01:22:38,754
and we're gonna name him Marcus
in your honor.

1801
01:22:38,837 --> 01:22:43,342
You're not the father.
He's not the father. I am. [chuckles]

1802
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:46,386
I've been trying
to tell you that all week.

1803
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:50,766
Okay, in Mexico, remember? I was gonna
run and jump off the cliff into the water.

1804
01:22:50,849 --> 01:22:53,352
- You're like, "Don't cover your balls."
- Yeah. So?

1805
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,854
Yeah, so, the impact from the jump, like,

1806
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,649
knocked the eight ball back
in the corner pocket.

1807
01:22:58,732 --> 01:23:01,485
'Cause now... now my balls work, man.

1808
01:23:02,861 --> 01:23:04,488
My balls work because of you.

1809
01:23:07,824 --> 01:23:09,326
So, that's not my baby?

1810
01:23:09,993 --> 01:23:11,119
- No.
- No.

1811
01:23:11,203 --> 01:23:13,497
[whispering] Yeah. It's not.

1812
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,581
Sorry.

1813
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:23,215
[Marcus clears throat, smacks lips]

1814
01:23:24,174 --> 01:23:29,721
I believe that the food choices are
between the fish

1815
01:23:30,722 --> 01:23:32,558
and... and the beef.

1816
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:35,143
- Yeah.
- I hear they're both really tasty.

1817
01:23:36,019 --> 01:23:38,855
- Did you cheat on my daughter?
- Captain, hold on.

1818
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:41,483
Answer me.
Did you have sex with that woman?

1819
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:43,610
I'm honestly very confused right now.

1820
01:23:43,694 --> 01:23:45,779
- No, Daddy, he didn't.
- How would you know?

1821
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:47,864
I just do, okay?

1822
01:23:47,948 --> 01:23:49,533
No! How would you know?

1823
01:23:49,616 --> 01:23:51,451
- Because I did.
- [guests gasp]

1824
01:23:51,535 --> 01:23:54,830
It's true. She did. It was hot.

1825
01:23:54,913 --> 01:23:57,332
I can vouch. [chuckles] Super hot.

1826
01:23:57,416 --> 01:23:59,751
This is the best wedding
I've ever been to.

1827
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,503
Seriously?

1828
01:24:01,587 --> 01:24:04,548
You... You will never marry my daughter.

1829
01:24:04,631 --> 01:24:06,091
What have you done to her?

1830
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,302
- He didn't do anything to me, Dad.
- [Gabe] Enough!

1831
01:24:08,385 --> 01:24:09,595
Move.

1832
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:11,346
Sis, you're not thinking straight, okay?

1833
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:13,390
Look, it's obvious to
everyone besides you

1834
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:15,809
that you're marrying some loser
who's only bringing you down.

1835
01:24:15,892 --> 01:24:17,144
Yo, who you talkin' about?

1836
01:24:17,227 --> 01:24:18,770
I am talking about you.

1837
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:21,648
You're utterly beneath her.
You have trash friends, a trash job.

1838
01:24:21,732 --> 01:24:23,650
And you wanna know
why? Because you are...

1839
01:24:23,734 --> 01:24:25,110
- What?
- [screams]

1840
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:26,695
Shit.

1841
01:24:26,778 --> 01:24:28,447
- Well.
- [chuckling] Okay.

1842
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,407
[man yodeling]

1843
01:24:31,116 --> 01:24:32,826
Look what you made me do again.

1844
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:34,870
Marcus. You give me back those rings.

1845
01:24:34,953 --> 01:24:36,955
- Just give me back those damn rings.
- Oh, my...

1846
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:39,207
Guess what, Harold.
It's not gonna happen.

1847
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:41,043
You know why? Because the rings…

1848
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,463
the rings are in the, um…

1849
01:24:45,589 --> 01:24:46,840
in the sewer.

1850
01:24:46,923 --> 01:24:48,383
[Emily's mother gasps]

1851
01:24:48,467 --> 01:24:50,135
[guests murmuring]

1852
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:51,219
My rings?

1853
01:24:51,303 --> 01:24:53,138
Marcus. [sighs] Marcus.

1854
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:57,392
- Is this who you want to marry?
- Not right now, Mom.

1855
01:24:57,476 --> 01:24:58,769
I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

1856
01:24:58,852 --> 01:25:00,979
Slow down, playboy.
Nobody's kicking anybody's ass.

1857
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:02,230
[grunts]

1858
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:03,815
- Yo.
- [grunts]

1859
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,192
[clamoring]

1860
01:25:05,275 --> 01:25:07,653
[Kyla] Ron! Oh, my God! You guys!

1861
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:16,328
[Kyla] Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

1862
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:18,538
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1863
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:20,290
[grunts] So sorry.

1864
01:25:25,962 --> 01:25:27,631
[grunts] Sorry.

1865
01:25:28,215 --> 01:25:30,634
- You think the bar's still open?
- Mmm.

1866
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:36,765
Marcus. Marcus, wait. Wait, baby.

1867
01:25:36,848 --> 01:25:39,267
Baby, why didn't you just tell me
you slept with Kyla?

1868
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:42,646
[sighs] I don't know, okay.
Everything was just so weird.

1869
01:25:42,729 --> 01:25:44,523
And like you said, we were all so drunk.

1870
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:48,068
It's no excuse, but it's not like you were
rushing to tell me you slept with her too.

1871
01:25:48,151 --> 01:25:50,153
- But I didn't sleep with her.
- But you thought you did.

1872
01:25:50,237 --> 01:25:52,948
- Yeah, 'cause she was on top of me.
- No. We were on top of you.

1873
01:25:53,031 --> 01:25:54,324
You were not involved.

1874
01:25:54,408 --> 01:25:55,826
- [Kyla] Almost.
- What are we doing?

1875
01:25:55,909 --> 01:25:58,495
[Kyla] You okay?
That was scary, right? Now…

1876
01:25:58,578 --> 01:25:59,496
What the hell?

1877
01:26:00,497 --> 01:26:03,250
Three, two times a day.
Down the hatch. Now swallow it down.

1878
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:05,419
- Get it down.
- Hey. Look. What are you doing?

1879
01:26:05,502 --> 01:26:06,962
- What?
- What?

1880
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:11,383
I knew it. Dr. Adolphus. You've been
giving her pills this whole time?

1881
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:13,510
She's in so much pain.
I'm just helping her manage it.

1882
01:26:13,593 --> 01:26:14,886
- [Emily] Oh, my God.
- What the fuck, Kyla?

1883
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,514
- What?
- She's old. She could OD.

1884
01:26:17,597 --> 01:26:19,808
- Grandma, spit it out.
- Hey, guys.

1885
01:26:19,891 --> 01:26:21,977
- [coughing]
- Grandma, Grandma. Spit it out. Grandma.

1886
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,437
Spit it out, Grandma! Grandma.

1887
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,688
I feel like I missed something.

1888
01:26:24,771 --> 01:26:26,231
You know what? Just try and swallow...

1889
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:28,942
Come here!
You had no right to give her drugs.

1890
01:26:29,025 --> 01:26:32,362
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, babe.
They're not drugs. They're herbs.

1891
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:34,740
Dr. Adolphus...
No, he's a homeopathic doctor.

1892
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:37,159
Bullshit.
You said he got in trouble with the law.

1893
01:26:37,242 --> 01:26:38,785
Yeah, for selling raw milk.

1894
01:26:38,869 --> 01:26:40,787
Oregon's just not as liberal
as people think.

1895
01:26:40,871 --> 01:26:42,914
Whatever. The fact is, that's my grandma.

1896
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:44,541
You should not have been
giving her anything.

1897
01:26:44,624 --> 01:26:46,126
[Marcus] That's the
problem with you two.

1898
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:48,295
Y'all love poking your noses
in other people's shit.

1899
01:26:48,378 --> 01:26:49,504
Marcus, that's not true.

1900
01:26:49,588 --> 01:26:50,714
Oh, it's not true?

1901
01:26:50,797 --> 01:26:55,135
So, why would you invite my coworkers
to a wedding without asking me?

1902
01:26:55,218 --> 01:26:57,929
Why did you pawn my rings? You didn't
ask me if we wanted to do that either.

1903
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:02,476
Or why would you put cocaine in the
drinks of people you don't even know?

1904
01:27:02,559 --> 01:27:06,521
Because I would want people to put
cocaine in my drink if they just met me.

1905
01:27:06,605 --> 01:27:08,231
We were just trying to be nice.

1906
01:27:08,315 --> 01:27:11,193
"Trying to be nice"
just blew up my fucking wedding!

1907
01:27:11,276 --> 01:27:12,194
[Marcus] This the crazy part.

1908
01:27:12,277 --> 01:27:14,696
We have no idea why you're here
'cause we didn't even invite you.

1909
01:27:14,780 --> 01:27:16,531
Marcus, we're here
because we're your friends.

1910
01:27:16,615 --> 01:27:19,201
Friends? You think we're friends?

1911
01:27:19,284 --> 01:27:21,036
We're not friends, okay!

1912
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:25,248
We were just vacation friends
for one week in Mexico!

1913
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:27,334
We didn't plan on
seeing y'all again, at all!

1914
01:27:27,417 --> 01:27:29,586
That's why I didn't give you
my phone number!

1915
01:27:31,588 --> 01:27:33,799
Okay, look. It's been an emotional night...

1916
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,300
Emotional? Let me say this to you.

1917
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:38,512
Your friend Charlie probably was able
to put up with your bullshit,

1918
01:27:38,595 --> 01:27:41,348
but I'm gonna tell you something,
we had enough.

1919
01:27:41,431 --> 01:27:42,432
We're done.

1920
01:27:42,516 --> 01:27:44,893
So do us a favor
and float the fuck outta here.

1921
01:27:51,107 --> 01:27:52,108
Kyla.

1922
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:07,833
Uh, baby, it had to be done.

1923
01:28:08,917 --> 01:28:11,002
Yeah. They... They had it...
They had it coming.

1924
01:28:12,546 --> 01:28:13,797
- Yeah.
- Right?

1925
01:28:14,798 --> 01:28:16,091
Yeah.

1926
01:28:16,174 --> 01:28:17,884
Grandma, let me get you back inside.

1927
01:28:22,013 --> 01:28:24,015
[birds chirping]

1928
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:29,563
[sighs] Oh, Emily says
Harold is still missing.

1929
01:28:29,646 --> 01:28:31,523
He was gone the whole night?

1930
01:28:31,606 --> 01:28:34,609
- You think your employees whupped his ass?
- [Nancy] Oh, stop.

1931
01:28:34,693 --> 01:28:37,112
Dad, no, okay. My employees wouldn't…

1932
01:28:40,323 --> 01:28:42,659
- Nah, you... you're being ridiculous.
- [door opens]

1933
01:28:42,742 --> 01:28:43,785
[laughing]

1934
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:46,079
There he is. The man of the hour.

1935
01:28:46,162 --> 01:28:47,664
Are y'all drinking already?

1936
01:28:47,747 --> 01:28:49,082
We still going from last night.

1937
01:28:49,165 --> 01:28:51,126
Yeah, man.
Your wedding just gets better and better.

1938
01:28:51,209 --> 01:28:52,961
Well, I'm glad you enjoying yourself,

1939
01:28:53,044 --> 01:28:56,214
but, honestly, I don't think
we gonna have a wedding anymore.

1940
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:58,133
- Do we get the Hennessy back?
- Mmm.

1941
01:28:58,216 --> 01:29:00,051
What are you talking about?
It's happening.

1942
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:01,386
- Says who?
- [door opens]

1943
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,139
Says this asshole.

1944
01:29:04,222 --> 01:29:06,641
[all laughing]

1945
01:29:06,725 --> 01:29:07,726
[Marcus] Harold?

1946
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,896
How are ya? Marcus. How you doing?

1947
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:12,981
Okay, look, man. Where have you been?

1948
01:29:13,064 --> 01:29:15,984
- [chuckles]
- Well, I've been with these fools.

1949
01:29:16,067 --> 01:29:17,944
It's an old army tradition.

1950
01:29:18,028 --> 01:29:21,114
When you punch a man,
you have to buy him a beer.

1951
01:29:21,197 --> 01:29:22,240
And we started drinking.

1952
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:25,327
[together] And drinking
and drinking and drinking.

1953
01:29:26,286 --> 01:29:30,248
And while we were drinking, the boys told
me about what it was like to work for you.

1954
01:29:31,374 --> 01:29:35,879
They said, "Oh, Marcus.
Marcus is so... so demanding,

1955
01:29:35,962 --> 01:29:38,840
so... so uncompromising."

1956
01:29:38,924 --> 01:29:42,844
I must admit,
it does sound like someone I know.

1957
01:29:42,928 --> 01:29:44,054
[chuckles]

1958
01:29:44,137 --> 01:29:49,601
Then they told me
why your last marriage ended.

1959
01:29:50,435 --> 01:29:51,436
Is that right?

1960
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,941
They said, your wife, she didn't wanna
go along with the sacrifices

1961
01:29:56,024 --> 01:29:58,109
that you made when the recession hit.

1962
01:30:00,278 --> 01:30:01,696
And they told me that…

1963
01:30:02,948 --> 01:30:04,366
[sighs]

1964
01:30:04,449 --> 01:30:09,704
…that you paid for
all of your employees, every man,

1965
01:30:09,788 --> 01:30:12,040
out of your own pocket.

1966
01:30:12,999 --> 01:30:14,501
Came back strong, though.

1967
01:30:14,584 --> 01:30:16,336
Thirty-five mil in revenue last year.

1968
01:30:16,419 --> 01:30:18,421
It's right there on the spreadsheet.

1969
01:30:18,505 --> 01:30:23,385
I admit, I haven't held you
in the highest esteem.

1970
01:30:24,302 --> 01:30:26,429
But you're a good businessman, Marcus.

1971
01:30:27,097 --> 01:30:31,726
But more important, you are a good man.

1972
01:30:33,603 --> 01:30:36,898
[chuckles] Wow. This means a lot, Harold.
I really appreciate...

1973
01:30:36,982 --> 01:30:39,609
[all laughing]

1974
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:44,280
Yes. And to think,
I would never known any of this

1975
01:30:44,364 --> 01:30:46,825
if you hadn't invited these boys.

1976
01:30:47,409 --> 01:30:50,245
But, no. I mean, I actually
didn't even invite them. [chuckles]

1977
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:52,831
Ron did.

1978
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:54,541
Huh.

1979
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:57,168
Where is Ron?

1980
01:30:58,169 --> 01:31:01,089
Hi, sweetie. Got a minute?

1981
01:31:01,172 --> 01:31:05,093
Grandma. I'm sorry about last night.
[sighs]

1982
01:31:05,176 --> 01:31:08,513
You mean when you stuck your hand
down my throat. [chuckles]

1983
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:10,849
- It happens.
- Does it?

1984
01:31:10,932 --> 01:31:12,517
Whoa, whoa.

1985
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,768
You can walk.

1986
01:31:13,852 --> 01:31:17,147
That pill Kyla gave me really works.

1987
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:18,898
- Seriously? The herbs?
- Yeah.

1988
01:31:18,982 --> 01:31:22,068
And it doesn't make me sleepy
like my usual pill.

1989
01:31:22,986 --> 01:31:25,530
Oh, she's a sweet girl.

1990
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:27,198
Yeah, she…

1991
01:31:28,992 --> 01:31:30,452
She's something. [sighs]

1992
01:31:30,535 --> 01:31:32,996
I'm sorry you two had a falling out.

1993
01:31:33,997 --> 01:31:36,416
But she did leave a wedding gift for you.

1994
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:47,510
"Emily, you're the sister I never had
because my real sister is a B-I-T-C-H.

1995
01:31:47,594 --> 01:31:51,181
I guess it doesn't work to spell out
bad words when you're writing.

1996
01:31:51,264 --> 01:31:52,599
And meeting Marcus…"

1997
01:31:54,976 --> 01:31:57,645
"And meeting Marcus
has brought Ron back to life.

1998
01:31:58,897 --> 01:31:59,898
You wouldn't know it,

1999
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:03,777
but he's been in a shit ton of pain
since he lost his best friend, Charlie.

2000
01:32:04,944 --> 01:32:07,822
When Charlie died,
half of Ron died with him.

2001
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:10,909
Or at least it did
until you guys came along.

2002
01:32:10,992 --> 01:32:13,661
I'm sorry we cocked up
your whole weekend.

2003
01:32:13,745 --> 01:32:17,207
To make up for it,
Ron spent all morning getting these back.

2004
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:20,960
PS: I'd wash them
before you put them on."

2005
01:32:28,093 --> 01:32:29,719
[sighs, scoffs]

2006
01:32:30,512 --> 01:32:31,971
We messed up, Marcus.

2007
01:32:32,055 --> 01:32:33,515
Yeah.

2008
01:32:33,598 --> 01:32:34,641
We gotta find them.

2009
01:32:34,724 --> 01:32:37,811
I don't know how we gonna do that.
Look, we ain't got a phone number on 'em.

2010
01:32:37,894 --> 01:32:40,480
- Shit, I don't even know where they went.
- [sighs]

2011
01:32:46,945 --> 01:32:49,531
[Emily] It should be close.
She said it was right down the block.

2012
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:52,700
Nope. [panting]
Damn, baby, you know there's a...

2013
01:32:52,784 --> 01:32:54,953
there's a hundred Waffle Houses
in Atlanta.

2014
01:32:55,036 --> 01:32:58,998
So then we'll just work our way up
from here in concentric circles.

01:33:33,032 --> 01:33:36,327
Mmm. Well, isn't this
an unhappy coincidence, huh, babe?

2022
01:33:36,411 --> 01:33:38,872
There's a Waffle House
right across the street.

2023
01:33:40,123 --> 01:33:41,958
- You should go eat at that one.
- [Marcus] Look, guys.

2024
01:33:42,041 --> 01:33:44,169
I know we said
some pretty shitty stuff last night.

2025
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:47,380
- Yeah, shitty, untrue stuff.
- And you right, and we were out of line.

2026
01:33:47,463 --> 01:33:49,507
Yeah.
You guys are not just vacation friends.

2027
01:33:49,591 --> 01:33:52,010
You're real friends,
and we should have treated you like that.

2028
01:33:52,093 --> 01:33:54,220
So, please come...
come back to the wedding.

I can't get married without my best man.

we know you mean 'em?

Well, what do you think? We go back?

2034
01:34:19,245 --> 01:34:20,830
- Fuck that.
- Kyla.

2035
01:34:20,914 --> 01:34:22,373
[Kyla] Ron, you heard them.

2036
01:34:22,457 --> 01:34:25,293
They were, like, accusing me
of giving drugs to people.

2037
01:34:26,544 --> 01:34:28,338
- You... You did.
- Only the good kind.

2038
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:30,173
Right. They were homeopathic.

2039
01:34:30,256 --> 01:34:32,383
No, I'm talking about the cocaine.

2040
01:34:33,176 --> 01:34:35,595
It was really, really good cocaine.

2041
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:38,640
No, honey.

2042
01:34:40,016 --> 01:34:41,017
It was great cocaine.

2043
01:34:41,643 --> 01:34:43,436
[crying] Thank you. I love you.

2044
01:34:44,562 --> 01:34:46,481
[Ron] They did come
all the way down here.

2045

Marcus kissed me on the forehead…

That's huge.

2048
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,033
Okay. We will come to your wedding,

2049
01:34:57,116 --> 01:34:58,868
but you have to promise
to do something for me.

2050
01:34:59,619 --> 01:35:00,912
Sure. What... What is it?

2051
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:06,167
You both have to promise
that you will come to ours.

Wait, wait, wait. Y'all getting married?

Well, Ron and I wanna do
what's best for Marcus.

2057
01:35:17,595 --> 01:35:19,264
Why do y'all wanna do
what's best for me?

2058
01:35:19,347 --> 01:35:21,516
No, Marcus… Marcus.

2059
01:35:22,308 --> 01:35:24,435
Our son who
we're literally naming after you.

[stammers] Yes, the baby.
The baby named Marcus.

- [Kyla giggles]

And, look, y'all.
I promise we'll be there.

2063
01:35:30,358 --> 01:35:33,361
Yeah.
So, where you guys thinking of having it?
